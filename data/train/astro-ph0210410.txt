    "studies of the structure of dark matter in collapsed objects of different masses show a remarkable universality .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the dark matter density profile has a universal shape ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) .",
    "this result provides a framework for the study of the relation between the baryonic and dark matter content of halos .",
    "clusters of different masses , with their large baryonic gas content , are excellent probes for such studies .",
    "if the physical properties of the baryonic gas contained in these self - similar potential wells were completely governed by gravity , then the observed properties of the gas would also be scale - free ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "for example , relation between the gas temperature and the cluster mass or the x - ray luminosity and the temperature , would be independent of the total mass ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "observations , however , show that in reality such relation deviate from being self - similar , pointing out the importance of non - gravitational processes determining the properties of the baryonic gas .",
    "the observed relation between luminosity and temperature steepens from the self - similar expectation of @xmath3 for low temperature clusters ( e.g. , markevitch 1998 ; allen & fabian 1998 ) . also the mass - temperature relation shows deviation from self - similarity ( e.g. , mccarthey 2002 ) .",
    "it has also been observed that the surface brightness profiles of poor groups ( with lower temperatures than richer clusters ) are relatively shallow ( ponman 1999 ) , showing that the underlying gas density profile is also shallow .",
    "all these observations clearly point towards some physical process which raises the entropy of the gas .",
    "indeed , direct determination of the gas entropy ( one defines an ` entropy ' @xmath4 which is the entropy of an ideal gas , stripped of the logarithm and the constant factors ) shows the existence of an ` entropy floor ' , a minimum level of entropy .",
    "lower temperature clusters , therefore , have relatively high entropy gas , compared to the expectations from self - similar models .",
    "it has been estimated that this ` entropy floor ' corresponds to @xmath5 kev @xmath6 ( ponman 1999 ) .",
    "one way to achieve this high level of entropy is to pre - heat the gas ( kaiser 1991 ) , and previous authors have estimated that extra non - gravitational heating of order @xmath7 kev per ( gas ) particle should suffice to explain the observations .",
    "the natural choices for the heating agents are supernovae driven winds ( e.g. , ponman 1999 ) and active galactic nuclei ( e.g , yamada & fujita 2001 ; nath & roychowdhury 2002 ) , although uncertainties prevail in the estimates of their effects on the intracluster medium .",
    "the other alternative is to siphon off the lowest entropy part of the gas through cooling , from the diffuse intracluster medium ( icm ) to some other phase , so that it does not enter the calculations of the x - ray luminosity or x - ray weighted temperature of the gas .",
    "voit & bryan ( 2002 ) recently argued on the basis of the cooling function for a metallicity of @xmath8 that radiative cooling can be an efficient process ( given a hubble time to operate on ) in introducing an entropy floor of the appropriate level .",
    "voit ( 2002 ) have studied the effect of different kinds of entropy modifications on the properties of the cluster gas . as an example of such an entropy modification , they considered the effect of radiative cooling , assuming that it would introduce an entropy threshold corresponding to the entropy at the cooling radius ( where cooling time equals the age of the system ) .",
    "they found that profiles with such an entropy threshold can adequately explain the observations .",
    "wu & xue ( 2002b ) also considered the effect of radiative cooling by removing the parcel of gas whose cooling time scale is less than the age of the cluster , which would cause the outer layers of gas to flow inside to again assume a hydrostatic profile .",
    "their calculation , however , assumes that the entropy of the outer gas remains unchanged as it flows inward .",
    "their predicted fraction of cool gas , however , exceeds the observed stellar mass fractions estimated by roussel , sadat & blanchard ( 2000 ) .",
    "it is clear that radiative cooling would set the intracluster gas in motion towards the center ( e.g. , silk 1976 , fabian 1994 , and more recently bhringer 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "since the x - ray properties of the gas mostly depend on the density and temperature profile of the gas , it is important to determine these profiles as accurately as possible , taking into account the changes brought about by such a flow .",
    "several authors have performed numerical simulations of cooling flows in clusters of different masses in light of the deviant x - ray properties of poor cluster , for example , knight & ponman ( 1997 ) , dav ( 2002 ) and muanwong ( 2002 ) .",
    "knight & ponman ( 1997 ) found that the density and temperature profiles caused by cooling flows were not sufficient to explain the x - ray properties , although they had used a @xmath9 cosmology with a dark matter profile from bertschinger ( 1985 ) , different from the universal profile used by more recent authors . also , they did not address the problem of the entropy ` floor ' as it was not known then . more recently muanwong ( 2002 ) found that cooling flows which come about as a result of radiative cooling can reproduce all observations , whereas dav ( 2002 ) find some discrepancy in their results compared to the observations .    in this paper , we study simple models of cooling flows for the effect they have on the x - ray properties of clusters , and in setting up the entropy floor. we simplify the cooling flow equations motivated by the recent x - ray observations ( e.g. , bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "we do not have any heating sources in the flow equations , so that we can study the effect of radiative cooling alone .",
    "we begin by setting up the background dark matter potential and the default profiles of the gas in the next section .",
    "we also introduce the cooling flow equations later in the section .",
    "we present the result of our calculations in  3 and discuss the implications , along with the uncertainties and limitations of our calculations in  4 .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we first consider the density profile of the dark matter which provides the potential for the gas particles .",
    "we assume that the gas mass is negligible compared to that of the total dark matter mass in the clusters , and that the dark matter density profile is given by the ` universal ' profile , expressed in terms of a characteristic radius @xmath13 ( e.g. , in komatsu & seljak 2002 ) , _",
    "dm(r)=_s y_dm(r / r_s ) , where @xmath14 is a normalizing density parameter and @xmath15 is given by y_dm(x)=1 x^",
    "( 1+x)^3- . here the parameter @xmath16 characterizes the shape of the profile .",
    "the total dark matter mass within a radius @xmath17 is m(r)=4 _ s r_s^3 m(r / r_s ) , [ eq : totm ] where , m(x)=_0^x du u^2 y_dm(u)=(1+x)-x 1+x ; here , the last equality is valid for @xmath18 which is the much used nfw profile ( navarro 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "recently , moore ( 1998 ) and jing & suto ( 2000 ) thought that @xmath19 better described their simulation results . for @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( suto 1998 ) .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath13 is related to the virial radius @xmath21 by the ` concentration parameter ' ( @xmath22 ) , as c .",
    "the total mass of the cluster is assumed to be the mass inside its virial radius .",
    "the virial radius is calculated in the spherical collapse model to be , r_vir=^1/3 = ^1/3 , where the second equality comes from evaluating equation ( [ eq : totm ] ) at the virial radius . here",
    "@xmath23 is the present day spherical overdensity of the virialized halo within @xmath21 at @xmath24 in the units of the critical density of the universe @xmath25 .",
    "following komatsu & seljak ( 2002 ) , we assume a value @xmath26 for a cosmological model with @xmath27 and @xmath10 .",
    "we follow seljak ( 2000 ) in adopting the approximation for @xmath22 as a function of the cluster mass , c=6 ( m_vir 10 ^ 14 h^-1 m _ ) ^-1/5 .",
    "the above set of equations specify the dark matter density profile given the mass of the cluster .",
    "we now turn our attention the profile assumed by gas in these clusters .",
    "to compare our results with observations , which usually use the radius @xmath28 where the overdensity is @xmath29 , we compute in each case this radius , and present our results in its terms .",
    "our aim is to determine the changes in the properties of the cluster which come about as a result of radiative cooling . for this",
    "we need to assume a ` default ' profile of the gas and then study the changes wrought upon the profile by these processes .",
    "we assume that the default profile is that of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with the background dark matter potential .",
    "this does not specify the gas density profile as more constraints are needed .",
    "one choice is that the gas obeys a polytropic equation of state .",
    "this has been shown to be provide an accurate description of the gas density and temperature profile for rich clusters .",
    "recent analyses find that gas profiles in hydrostatic equilibrium with a polytropic index @xmath30 , where pressure of the gas is related to the density as @xmath31 describe the observations well ( markevitch 1998 ) . since the rich clusters are thought to have been affected minimally by non - gravitational processes , these profiles provide a natural choice for the default profile .",
    "we note that this was also the approach of wu , fabian & nulsen ( 2000 ) .",
    "recently , komatsu & seljak ( 2002 ) have determined the solutions to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation , in the case of a polytropic gas , with the constraint that the gas profile is proportional to that of the dark matter at large radii .",
    "this physically motivated constraint limits the range of the polytropic index @xmath32 , and they find that their solutions yield values of @xmath32 within the range between @xmath33 and @xmath34 for clusters with masses between @xmath35 m@xmath1 , as found in observations .",
    "they also provide useful analytical fits for their solutions .",
    "we adopt these profiles obtained by komatsu & seljak ( 2002 ) as one set of our default profiles ( set a ) .",
    "we normalize these profiles by assuming that the ratio of the gas mass inside the virial radius to the total virial mass is constant for all clusters , and equals @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath37 as constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis , as @xmath38 ( burles & tytler 1999 ) .",
    "we also use another set of default profiles ( set b ) , in which the gas density is given by @xmath39 , being proportional to the background dark matter density .",
    "this has been choice of several recent authors , e.g. , bryan ( 2000 ) , voit ( 2002 ) and others .",
    "the temperature profile is then given by the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , = - _ g(r ) gm(r ) r^2 .",
    "where @xmath40 is the total mass inside radius @xmath17 .",
    "we calculate the temperature profile of the gas with the boundary condition that the pressure is zero at infinity ( as in wu & xue ( 2000a ) ) .",
    "the resulting profiles are different from that of bryan ( 2000 ) only near the virial radius and does not affect our calculations of the x - ray properties , since we compute these properties only to an extent @xmath28 , which is somewhat smaller than @xmath21 for our choice of cosmology .",
    "as we will find in the next section , the default temperature profiles for set a and b differ substantially . the temperature profile for set a are flat in the core region , whereas those for set b decline towards the centre .",
    "the recent observations with the help of _ chandra _ for the x - ray gas fraction in clusters favour the default profiles for set a , with gas fraction increasing with cluster mass ( allen , schmidt & fabian 2002 ) . in contrast , the gas fraction for set b is constant by construction .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of temperature profiles of some relaxed clusters do show declining temperature in the very central region though , as in set b profiles ( e.g , schmidt , allen & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "if we define a cooling radius , @xmath41 as where the cooling time of the gas equals the age of the cluster , then the gas inside this cooling radius would cool rapidly .",
    "it is widely believed that in this case a cooling flow would ensue ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "although it was generally believed in the last decade that cooling flows would have several phases , with gas being deposited at different radii , recent observations find that such multiphase gas occurs only at the very central region and for most of the region of the flow , one can assume it to be homogeneous ( e.g. , bhringer 2002 , and reference therein ) . also , recent observations rule out flows with very large mass flux and gas temperatures dropping to very low temperatures , unless at the very central regions , pointing towards the subsonic nature of the flows .    motivated by these points , we simplify the fluid equations by assuming a steady , homogeneous and subsonic flow , in which the flow is dictated by the following equations : & = & 4r^2 u + dp dr&=&- + ud dr(h+)&=&n_e^2 _ n ( t ) , where @xmath42 is the specific enthalpy , @xmath43 is the electron density , @xmath44 denotes the normalized cooling function in the units of erg @xmath45 s@xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the gravitational potential .",
    "the cooling function is normalized in a way so that the total rate of cooling is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the ion density ( here we take @xmath50 ) .",
    "we assume a metallicity of @xmath51 for the icm that is observed in rich clusters and which has been used by all previous authors .",
    "we note here that there is a large uncertainty in the abundance measurements for the gas in poor clusters ( davis 1999 ; buote 2000 ) .",
    "we use a fit to the normalized cooling function for this metallicity as calculated by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) as described in appendix a.    if we scale the density and temperature to their values at @xmath41 , defining @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the temperature at @xmath41 ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , also @xmath56 , then the above equations can be cast into a set of two equations with dimensionless variables , & = & n^2 x^2 t_fo t_co ( t ) ( t_c ) - a ( ( 1 + x ) -x ( 1+x ) ^2 ) ( x ) ^2 + d",
    "n dx&=&-a nt ( ( 1+x ) -x ( 1+x ) ^2 ) ( x ) ^2 -n t dt dx , [ eq : coolfl ] where we have assumed @xmath18 for the background dark matter profile , and where a=4 g _ s r_s",
    "r_cool m_p / k_b t_c is a dimensionless quantity and is a measure of the ratio between the potential and thermal energies at @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath57 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "if @xmath58 is small , as is the case for rich clusters , then gravity is negligible and one has a constant pressure solution . in the last equation ,",
    "we have defined the flow time at @xmath41 as , t_fo = r_cool / u_cool=4 _ cool r_cool^3/ , and the cooling time at @xmath41 to be , t_co=(5/2 ) n_cool k_b t_c n_e , cool^2 ( t_c ) .",
    "it is then possible to have a family of solutions for this equations for different boundary conditions . in the spirit of nulsen ( 1982 ; appendix a ) , we will refer to the solution for which @xmath59 as @xmath60 ( meaning @xmath61 as @xmath62 ) as the ` cooling eigensolution ' .",
    "this boundary condition will fix the value of the ratio @xmath63 , which will in turn fix the value of the mass flux .",
    "the value of this ratio for the eigensolutions are of order unity as expected ( nulsen 1982 ) .",
    "larger values of @xmath64 than these particular values would then yield solutions for which temperatures plunge to very low values at @xmath65 .",
    "these profiles would give rise to x - ray holes in clusters of galaxy , and we will not study them here .",
    "smaller values of the ratio lead to solutions for which temperatures are larger than those for the eigensolutions .",
    "at the other extreme , there are solutions to the cooling flow equations with very small values of @xmath66 corresponding to flows with very large mass flux rate .",
    "we find that the profiles for such small values differ little if one decreases this ratio below values of order @xmath67 .",
    "one can actually get a formal limit to the profiles by putting this ratio equal to zero in the cooling flow equations , and numerically obtained profiles tend toward these limiting profiles very rapidly below this value of @xmath68 . for these solutions ,",
    "gas temperature is determined mainly by the gravitational potential , as in this case @xmath69 ( see also fabian 1984 ) , especially for poor clusters where gravity is important ( where @xmath58 is large ) . such cases correspond to flows with mass flux rates that are @xmath5 times larger than the rates for eigensolutions .",
    "we will refer to these set of limiting solutions as flows with the highest entropy and very large mass flux rates .",
    "these two limits of the family of solutions parameterized by the ratio @xmath68 , or , equivalently , the mass flux rate , constrain the physical solutions of the cooling flow equations relevant for our purpose .    gas beyond the cooling radius , @xmath41 will remain at hydrostatic equilibrium . for gas beyond this radius ,",
    "we adopt the profiles as discussed in the preceding section , which allow us to calculate the extent @xmath41 and then @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we then use these values in equation ( [ eq : coolfl ] ) to determine the cooling eigensolution for @xmath72 .",
    "we find that although the cooling eigensolutions are easily determined for set a profiles , the transition from the case of @xmath73 at @xmath74 to @xmath73 at @xmath75 happens over an extremely small range of values of the ratio @xmath63 , making it difficult to evaluate the exact eigensolution .",
    "we have therefore used the lowest entropy profile , with the lowest temperature possible at the central region , as the eigensolutions for set b default profiles .",
    "we perform two sets of calculations with the age of the clusters being @xmath76 and @xmath77 yr for the two sets .",
    "we have done the calculations for cluster masses for which @xmath78 where the cooling flows could have some tangible effects on the observable properties of the gas .",
    "we have checked that the effect of cooling flows on the total x - ray luminosity is less than @xmath79 for clusters with larger masses .",
    "we have computed the profiles for these two extreme cases for default profiles in set a and b. an example of the gas density and temperature profiles for a cluster mass of @xmath80 m@xmath1 is shown in figure 1 , for a cooling time of @xmath76 yr .",
    "the top panels in figure 1 show the density profiles , where the dotted lines show the default profile , the solid slines show the lowest entropy and the dashed lines show the highest entropy cases .",
    "the bottom panels show the temperature profiles for the corresponding cases .",
    "= 1.0    -3 mm    an important difference between the set a and b cases is that the default gas temperature at a given radius in set b ( in which the gas density is proportional to the dark matter profile ) is smaller than in set a. this results in making the cooling radius larger for set b than in set a ( as the cooling function in the relevant temperature range increases with decreasing temperature ) .",
    "this makes cooling flows somewhat more extensive for set b profiles .",
    "although this is true for clusters of a given mass , the emission weighted temperature for set b profiles are smaller than those for set a profiles .",
    "since the emission weighted temperature is the observed parameter , and not the mass , we find that for a given cluster temperature , set b profiles have cooling flows with smaller extent .",
    "we show the ratio @xmath81 as a function of the emission weighted temperature ( see below ) in figure 2 for the two sets of default profiles and two choices of the cooling time .",
    "curves in figure 2 also show that the cooling flows are more extensive for lower temperature clusters as expected .",
    "= 1.0    -3 mm    the corresponding entropy profiles are shown in figure 3 , which shows more differences between the cases set a and b. firstly , set a profiles ( with polytropic equation of state ) have higher entropy to begin with ( upper dotted line ) .",
    "this is expected from other results obtained by komatsu & seljak ( 2000 ) regarding the shape of the profile .",
    "they showed that their profiles assuming polytropic equation of state could already explain the observed relation between the parameter @xmath82 ( which defines the density profile ) .",
    "observations show that @xmath82 increases with cluster mass , showing that poor clusters have shallower profiles , which is an indication of higher entropy .",
    "it is therefore expected that these default profiles would have higher entropy than the other set of default profiles .",
    "secondly , cooling eigensolutions with the lowest entropy ( upper solid line ) can decrease the entropy of the set a default profiles .",
    "the default profile for set b ( lower dotted line ) , however , has very low entropy to begin with , and it is difficult to find solutions of the cooling flow with entropy lower than this .",
    "the lowest entropy flows ( lower solid line ) in fact has larger entropy than the default profile in this case .",
    "= 1.0    -3 mm    this difference is also manifested in the mass flux rates .",
    "figure 4 shows the mass flux rates for the cooling eigensolutions ( lowest entropy cases ) , with solid line for set a and dotted line for set b. observational data points from white ( 1997 ) are also shown for comparison , although we note that in light of the new measurements ( see b \" ohringer 2002 ) these data points may be overestimates for the mass flux .",
    "the mass flux is plotted against the emission weighted temperature ( see below ) . as expected from our definition of ` cooling eigensolutions '",
    ", these solutions should provide the lowest mass flux rate for observed cooling flows , since flows with mass flux lower than this would correspond to holes in x - ray .",
    "the locus of these solutions for set a indeed seems to provide a lower envelope for the data points .",
    "the mass flux rate for the lowest entropy cases for set b profiles are larger than these .",
    "since the appropriate mass flux rate for our highest entropy flows are @xmath5 times larger than those for the cooling eigensolutions , from the curves in figure 4 , we find that these highest entropy flows are characterized by mass fluxes in excess of @xmath0 m@xmath1 per yr , for clusters with emission weighted temperature @xmath83 kev .",
    "going back to the entropy profiles in figure 3 , the long dashed lines show the highest entropy cases .",
    "it is seen from this figure that there is a variety of entropy profiles for the gas undergoing cooling flow depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "we wish to point out that all these profiles have only one free parameter , once the default profile is given , and that is the age of the system ( assumed to be @xmath76 and @xmath77 yr here ) .",
    "in other words , there is no single entropy threshold given the time allowed for the gas to cool , but that there is a large number of possibilities spanning a large range in entropy , depending on the mass flux .",

    "below this temperature , it is possible to raise ( or even lower ) the entropy level of the gas undergoing cooling flow , depending on the mass flux , and it is possible that cooling flows in very poor clusters may be responsible for raising the entropy of the gas to some extent .",
    "= 1.0    -3 mm",
    "we will discuss some of the implications of our results as well as a few uncertainties involved in our calculations in this section .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show some of the difficulties of explaining the observations with radiative cooling alone .",
    "to recapitulate the premises of our calculations , we assumed that radiative cooling must give rise to a gas flow towards the centre .",
    "here we have only studied steady and subsonic flows for simplicity , and motivated by the fact that recent x - ray observations do not detect flows with very high mass flux which require supersonic flows ( except in the very vicinity of the centre ) and also flows with mass deposition ( which would make it inhomogeneous ) are not detected .",
    "let us discuss the implications of our results given these assumptions .",
    "curves in figure 6 show that the default profiles do not differ much from the self - similar case , although the set a profiles generally have larger entropy .",
    "the region bounded by the solid and long dashed lines show the possible values of entropy at @xmath88 for cooling flows with different mass fluxes , with flows of larger mass flux rate occupying regions with larger entropy .",
    "as the curves show , these solid and dashed lines merge with the dotted line of the default profile at high temperatures .",
    "this is because of the simple reason that for high temperature clusters , the cooling radius is smaller than the fiducial radius @xmath88 , and so cooling flows do not affect the entropy measurement at this fiducial radius for high temperature clusters .",
    "since the entropy measurements are made at a given fiducial radius of @xmath88 , for cooling flows to have any effect on the raising of the entropy , the cooling radius _ must _ exceed this fiducial radius .",
    "we find that for both of our choice of default profiles , the cooling radius is inside this fiducial radius for @xmath89 kev , for a cooling time of @xmath76 yr . for a longer cooling time of @xmath77 yr , the set a profiles provide a larger cooling radius , and can potentially explain the entropy measurements given the uncertainties .",
    "below this temperature , it is possible that cooling flows can enhance the entropy of the gas given a large enough mass flux rate ( shown by the long dashed lines in figure 6 , corresponding to mass flux rates of @xmath90 m@xmath1 per yr ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the maximum attainable entropy ( at @xmath88 ) is much larger than the entropy at the cooling radius ( as seen from the example of entropy profile in figure 3 ) .",
    "the entropy at the cooling radius is obtained by setting the cooling time of the gas equal to the age of the system , as was calculated by voit & bryan ( 2002 ) .",
    "flow of gas under the influence of the gravitational potential can heat up the gas substantially and raise the entropy inside the cooling radius , which is clearly shown in the example portrayed in figure 3 .      from the results in figure 5 ,",
    "we find that although cooling flows decrease the luminosities to some extent , the calculated x - ray luminosities are still larger than observed luminosities .",
    "the inclusion of cooling flows decreases the x - ray luminosities to some extent for set a profiles , and to a large extent for set b profiles .",
    "this effect steepens the @xmath91 vs. @xmath92 relation compared to those of the default profiles .",
    "the lowest attainable x - ray luminosities correspond to the long dashed lines , which show the case of flows with @xmath93 , and with mass flux rate of @xmath94 m@xmath1 per yr .",
    "increasing the cooling time to @xmath77 yr decreases the luminosities somewhat more , but are still larger than the observed luminosities .",
    "we therefore find that flows with mass flux rates in excess of @xmath0 m@xmath1 per yr are required to explain the x - ray luminosities with radiative cooling alone .",
    "recently bryan ( 2000 ) and wu & xue ( 2002a ) showed that one can explain the x - ray observations by eliminating the gas in the central region ( defined by the cooling region by wu & xue ( 2002b ) ) and replacing this gas by the outer gas , _ keeping the entropy constant_. in reality , however , the flow that would ensue as a result of cooling flows will not keep the entropy of the gas constant , since it is not an adiabatic process .",
    "it is however possible to neglect the cooling of the gas , and therefore assume an isentropic transport of the gas , _ if the flow time is much smaller than the cooling time of the gas_. this situation , however , corresponds to flows with very large mass flux rates , as shown by equation ( 12 ) that defines the flow time .",
    "we therefore reach the conclusion that flows with very large mass flux rates are needed to explain the observations .      in reality",
    "the cooling radius is an increasing function of time , and the results presented above pertain to a simplified treatment of steady cooling flows , with the mass flux rate being constant in time and for all radii .",
    "one expects the mass flux rates to vary in time , as shown by the study of self - similar cooling flows by bertschinger ( 1989 ) , or the numerical simulation by knight & ponman ( 1987 ) .",
    "also , the cooling flows are expected to be disrupted from time to time by mergers of subclusters which would change the mass flux rate , as seen in the numerical simulation by knight & ponman ( 1987 ) .",
    "admittedly our simplified treatment can not capture these aspects of cooling flows , but the conclusions reached in the previous paragraphs are expected to be general and robust .    also , there has been a recent surge of interest in the study of cooling flows in light of the recent x - ray observations , and a number of authors have pointed out the intimate connection between active galaxies and cooling flows ( e.g , churazov 2001 ; binney & kaiser 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "for example , binney & kaiser ( 2002 ) pointed out that as the entropy is continually lowered by cooling flows , it will trigger some nuclear activity in the centre from time to time .",
    "they argued that this would make flows with a large drop in temperature in the centre less probable for detection .",
    "we did not include any heating source in our cooling flow equations so that we could study the effect of only radiative cooling .",
    "in fact our results suggest that additional heating sources , possibly from active galaxies , would be needed to explain the observations .",
    "we wish to discuss some of the uncertainties pertaining to our calculations .",
    "first , there is an uncertainty of the background dark matter density profile . in the preceding sections ,",
    "we have only discussed the case of the universal profile with the value of @xmath18 .",
    "we have also calculated the lower and upper bounds of the x - ray luminosity in the case of @xmath19 , and found that results differ only by a small amount .",
    "recently , however , kelson ( 2002 ) have pointed out that it is even possible for the value of @xmath16 to be much smaller than unity .",
    "also , it was shown by lloyd - davies ( 2002 ) that the choice of the concentration parameter can introduce some uncertainty in the calculations of x - ray properties of the gas .",
    "voit ( 2002 ) also showed the choice of the concentration parameter can shift the results to some extent .",
    "we based our calculations on two different sets of default profiles for these uncertainties , to determine the effects of the assumption of initial profiles on the final result .",
    "although the details of cooling flows for our two choices of default profiles are somewhat different , the final conclusions do not differ much , suggesting that our conclusions are robust .",
    "we have studied cooling flow solutions for two different sets of default profiles , one with gas obeying a polytropic equation of state ( set a ) and the other in which the gas density is proportional to that of the dark matter ( set b ) .",
    "we have simplified the cooling flow equations to the case of steady , homogeneous and subsonic flows . within the purview of such flows",
    ", we find that :    \\(a ) cooling flows can either increase or decrease the entropy of the gas compared to the default ( ` no - cooling ' ) profile depending on the mass flux rate .",
    "in other words , cooling for a given duration does not introduce a given entropy threshold for the gas ; the entropy profile depends on the mass flux rate .",
    "\\(b ) for a cooling time of @xmath76 yr , the cooling radius exceeds the fiducial radius @xmath88 only for clusters with @xmath83 kev , which makes it difficult for cooling flows to have any effect on the entropy at this radius for clusters with @xmath95 of order of a few kev , where the expected entropy from the self - similar case falls short of the observed values . increasing the cooling time to @xmath77",
    "yr can increase the cooling radius for clusters beyond @xmath96 kev , and can potentially explain the observations .",
    "we also find that cooling flows can increase the entropy at this fiducial radius for lower temperature clusters .",
    "\\(c ) cooling flows that are caused by radiative cooling of gas in the central region can decrease the x - ray luminosities for poor clusters and steepen the relation between @xmath97 and @xmath92 compared to the self - similar expectation , but flows with mass flux rates in excess of @xmath90 m@xmath1 per yr are required to explain the observations if heating sources are not taken into account .    * acknowledgement * i am indebted to drs .",
