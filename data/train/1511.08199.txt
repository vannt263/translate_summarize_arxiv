    ". however , the density structure of the halo could be more complex : adiabatic response of the dark halo to the baryonic component or the capture of satellite halos in low - inclination orbits could lead to the formation of a thick dark disk superimposed on the quasi - spherical halo ( read et al .",

    "a dark disk may enhance direct detection because the flux of particules is proportional to the density .",
    "if the dark disk is in counter - rotation , the flux is enhanced due to a larger relative velocity between the sun and the dm particles .    in recent years",
    ", many attempts have been carried out to determine the local dm density within a few hundred parsecs of the sun ( see read 2014 for a review ) .",

    "bovy & tremaine ( 2012 ) reanalysed their data using other model assumptions , finding values fully consistent with standard estimates of this quantity .",
    "the estimate of @xmath16 depends on the adopted radial and vertical scalelengths of the thick disk , denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",

    ", @xmath78 can not be fitted satisfactorily , unless @xmath120 is unusually large .",
    "thus , we suggest that much of the offset between @xmath78 and what models predict is caused by systematics in the data . if we fit simultaneously @xmath77 and @xmath186 , and ignore @xmath78 ( because it does not participate in the poisson equation ) then we obtain @xmath355pc@xmath10 for @xmath335 kpc . as already said , a reduction of @xmath27 results in a higher value for @xmath16 because @xmath349 increases , whereas @xmath186 is independent of @xmath27 .",
    "moni bidin et al .  ( 2012b ) found that large values for @xmath27 , typically @xmath356 kpc , were required to recover the standard values for @xmath16 .",
    "this result is a consequence of their different assumptions ; mainly their hypothesis that @xmath357 .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the baryonic disk can be described by an exponential disk with a mass - weighted scale length , @xmath260 , of @xmath358 kpc .",
    "if @xmath260 is larger , the baryonic mass in the disk turns to be smaller and hence more dm is required to account for the dynamics .",
    "typically , @xmath16 increases by @xmath99 , if we adopt @xmath359 kpc instead of @xmath358 kpc .",
    "having knowledge of the volume density @xmath360 and vertical velocity for a vast number of some equilibrium tracer stars , the dynamical surface density can be measured at heights @xmath361 kpc above the galactic midplane , using the one - dimensional approximation , i.e.  @xmath362 and neglecting the @xmath111-tilt term in the jeans equation ( e.g. , kuijken & gilmore 1989 ; read 2014 ) . at higher galactic heights , the one - dimensional approximation may introduce bias ( siebert et al .  2008 ; smith et al .  2009 ; garbari et al .",
    "2012 ; mckee et al .",
    "bovy & tremaine ( 2012 ) claimed that the assumption @xmath362 provides a robust lower limit to the surface density at @xmath107 kpc , as far as @xmath363 in the midplane . using the sample of thick disk stars reported in moni bidin et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , bovy & tremaine ( 2012 ) found that the mean halo density between @xmath168 and @xmath134 kpc is @xmath364pc@xmath10 for @xmath29 kpc and @xmath30 kpc or @xmath365pc@xmath10 for @xmath32 kpc and @xmath33 kpc .",
    "moni bidin et al .  (",
    "2015 ) have challanged the @xmath366 assumption of bovy & tremaine ( 2012 ) on the basis that it is not generally true that it holds for any galactic potential .",
    "moni bidin et al .  (",
    "2015 ) argue that this assumption is implicitly constraining the mass distribution and , thus , it is not adequate to derive @xmath16 . in order to release this hypothesis , moni bidin et al .",
    "( 2015 ) moved beyond the one - dimensional approximation and , instead of assuming @xmath362 ( or , equivalently @xmath367 ) , they used a dynamical measure of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 , which was derived from the kinematics of the same tracer population .",
    "the computation of @xmath7 requires knowledge of @xmath43 , which implicitly depends on the local circular velocity at the midplane , and @xmath118 , which is rather uncertain . using this three - dimensional formalism , moni bidin et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found that the density of dm at @xmath107 kpc is @xmath368 pc@xmath10 for @xmath29 kpc and @xmath30 kpc and @xmath369 pc@xmath10 for @xmath37 kpc and @xmath33 kpc .",
    "these results are at variance with those derived by bovy & tremaine ( 2012 ) . in order to fully understand this discrepancy",
    ", we investigated the robustness of both approaches in detail .",
    "we have shown that the cmb estimator ( after correcting it by a missed term in moni bidin et al .  2012b , 2015 )",
    "is more sensitive to uncertainties in the geometrical parameters of the thick disk , particularly on @xmath136 , than the bt estimator .",
    "therefore , accurate determinations of the dynamical surface density require good measures of the radial scalelengths of each of the components of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "using the jeans equations and the current data of the kinematics of thick disk stars , we derived the vertical profiles of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 . assuming @xmath126 km s@xmath15 and @xmath160 kpc",
    ", we found that the kinematical estimates of @xmath2 and @xmath7 are biased towards large negative values .",
    "possible causes are : poor model assumptions ( e.g. , neglecting the flare of the thick disk ) , uncertainties in the adopted values for @xmath120 , @xmath43 or @xmath118 , systematic overestimations of @xmath370 , @xmath371 , or @xmath372 , or underestimations of the radial scalelengths of the components of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "we have built simple but representative galactic models consisting of the bulge , the baryonic disk and a dm component , having a local dm density as those inferred by the bt estimator and the cmb estimator ( using @xmath160 kpc and @xmath126 km s@xmath15 .",
    "we have compared @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 in these galactic mass models with their corresponding estimates using the currently available kinematical data of the thick disk and found significant discrepancies between them .",
    "this implies that either the mass models do not describe correctly the underlying galactic potential , or systematic errors and uncertain assumptions are affecting the dynamical estimates of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "we also stress the result that mass distributions with different local surface density may exhibit similar values of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to discriminate between these models , precise measurements of @xmath196 are required .",
    "since the currently available kinematical data of thick disk stars are not good enough to provide a precise value of @xmath196 , we conclude that these data are not sufficient to constrain @xmath373 without making further assumptions .    in order to examine the role and magnitude of the different systematics",
    ", we applied the bt and cmb estimators to estimate the surface density of a mock thick disk of tracer stars embedded in a fixed milky way - like gravitational potential , and compared with the exact input value . to do so",
    ", we prepared a thick disk population as close as we could to the assumptions behind the three - dimensional approach , namely , a thick disk following a rather homogeneous , doubly exponential distribution of stars in radius and height .",
    "however , our simulated thick disk has @xmath74 that depend strongly on @xmath8 , whereas the cmb apprach assumes that they are constant with @xmath8 .",
    "our analysis suggests that , even if @xmath120 , @xmath43 , @xmath350 and all the mean geometrical parameters of the thick disk were accurately known , inaccuracies underpredict @xmath7 by a factor of @xmath147 at @xmath209 kpc above the disk .",
    "still , the cmb formula , applied to our mock data , was able to recover the input surface density within the uncertainties .    under the assumption that the dm halo is spherically symmetric interior to the radius @xmath374 , we have explored what configuration of parameters is more compatible with the current kinematic data of the thick disk .",
    "we have used a parametric mass model , consisting of the bulge , the baryonic disk and a dark halo .",
    "we have fit @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath186 with two free parameters ; the contribution of the dark halo to the local circular velocity @xmath271 and the power - law exponent @xmath266 .",
    "acceptable fits are obtained if the thick disk is slightly flared and for the following geometrical parameters : @xmath375 kpc , @xmath376 kpc , @xmath377 kpc , @xmath378 kpc , and for a dark halo with @xmath379pc@xmath10 . for smaller values of @xmath27 , the estimated value for @xmath16 increases , but the fit to @xmath2 worsens .",
    "the currently available kinematical data of the thick disk stars up to @xmath0 kpc above the galactic midplane , may be also compatible with a flatten disk - like distribution of dm , having a dm density at @xmath107 kpc as low as that derived in moni bidin et al .",
    "however , this model possibly has too large negative values of @xmath196 .",
    "we thank the referee , dr .  c.  moni bidin , for a very detailed report and constructive comments , which helped to improve the quality of the paper significantly .",
    "this work has been partly supported by conacyt project 165584 .",

    "finally , @xmath7 is given by : @xmath387 where @xmath388 and @xmath389    the geometrical parameters @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 are essentially local derivatives of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which can be measured in the simulations at a generic point @xmath380 .",

    "@xmath406 kpc , whereas in the second case @xmath407 kpc .",
    "this uncertainty in the second - order derivatives were not included in the analysis of  [ sec : dynamicaltests ] .",

    "the gravitational potential is given by the sum of the contribution of the disk @xmath408 plus the contribution of the spherical component @xmath194 .",
