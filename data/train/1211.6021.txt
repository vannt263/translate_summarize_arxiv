    "the black hole solutions of diverse dimensions , represent now one of the basic objects for study in superstring theory .",
    "recent ideas and methods in the black hole physics are based on complex analyticity and conformal field theory , which unifies the black hole physics with superstring theory and physics of elementary particles .",
    "the kerr solution plays in this respect especial role .",
    "being obtained as a metric of a `` spinning mass '' @xcite with angular momentum @xmath0 the kerr solution found basic application as a metric of rotating black hole . in the four - dimensional kerr solution , parameter @xmath1 is radius of the kerr singular ring . for @xmath2",
    "the ring is covered by horizon , but for parameters of the elementary particles @xmath3 the black hole horizons disappear , and the kerr singular ring turns out to be naked . following the censorship principle , it should be covered by a source . during four decades of investigations ,",
    "structure of kerr s source was specified step by step .",
    "one of the earlier models was the model of the kerr ring as a closed string @xcite .",
    "it has been obtained in @xcite that structure of the fields around the kerr ring is similar to the structure of the heterotic string in the solutions to low energy string theory obtained by sen @xcite .",
    "however , the kerr string is branch line of the kerr space - time into two sheets @xcite , and this bizarre peculiarity created an alternative line of investigations of the problem of kerr s source,@xcite , which led to conclusion that the source of the kerr - newman ( kn ) solution should form a rigidly rotating membrane , or to be more precise , a highly oblate ellipsoidal bubble with a flat vacuum interior @xcite .",
    "the charged kn solution @xcite has found application as a consistent with gravity classical model of spinning particle , @xcite , which has gyromagnetic ratio @xmath4 as that of the dirac electron @xcite , and also displays other relationships with the dirac electron , @xcite , as well as the relationships with twistor theory @xcite , models of the soliton @xcite and with basic structures of superstring theory @xcite .    in this note",
    "we consider complex structure of the kerr geometry @xcite and reveal one new evidence of its inherent parallelism with superstring theory .",
    "namely , we show the presence of _ the calabi - yau twofold _",
    "( k3 surface ) in complex structure of the kerr geometry , which appears as a consequence of the kerr theorem in the form of a quartic equation in the projective twistor space @xmath5 in section 2 .",
    "we describe briefly the real structure of the kerr geometry and the kerr theorem , which determines kerr s principal null congruence ( pnc ) in twistor terms .    on the way to this principal result",
    "we meet a few important intermediate complex and stringy structures .",
    "first of all it is the complex kerr geometry itself , which turns out to be related with the suggested by appel in 1887 `` complex shift '' , @xcite , and the reobtained and developed by newman complex retarded - time construction @xcite .",
    "we describe them in section 3 .    in section 4 .",
    "we show that the source of the complex kerr geometry is to be an open complex string .",
    "it is closely linked with the old remarks by ooguri and vafa , that the complex world lines ( cwl ) parametrized by complex time parameter @xmath6 are in fact to be world - sheets of the complex string , @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the boundary conditions of the complex kerr string , generating the complex kerr geometry , require orientifold structure of its world - sheet .    finally , we observe that the structure of the membrane ( vacuum bubble @xcite ) source of the _ real _ kerr geometry turns out to be parallel to formation of the membrane in the superstring / m - theory unification .",
    "namely , the closed kerr string of the real kerr geometry grows by extra world - sheet parameter of the open complex kerr string , @xcite , resulting in formation of the kerr bubble - membrane source , which is parallel to construction of enhancon in string / m - theory @xcite .",
    "this parallelism of the structure of kerr geometry with basic structures of the superstring theory , and in particular , the inherent existence of the k3 surface , enforces us to draw a parallel with the critical n=2 superstring theory @xcite , which describes a complex two - dimensional string ( four real dimensions ) and is closely related with twistor theory too .",
    "this allows us to suggest that the complex kerr string represents an embedding of the critical n=2 superstring theory into complex kerr geometry .",
    "kn metric is represented in the kerr - schild ( ks ) form @xcite , g_=_+ 2h e^3_e^3_[ksh ] , where @xmath7 is auxiliary minkowski background in cartesian coordinates @xmath8 h = p^2 , p=(1+y)/ 2 , [ h]and @xmath9 is a tangent direction to a _ principal null congruence ( pnc ) _ , which is determined by the form e^3_dx^=du + |y d + y d |- y|y dv , [ e3 ] via function @xmath10 which is obtained from _ the kerr theorem _ , @xcite .",
    "the pnc forms a caustic at the kerr singular ring , @xmath11 as a result , the kn metric ( [ ksh ] ) and electromagnetic potential a _ = -p^-2 re e^3_[amu ] , are aligned with kerr pnc and concentrate near the kerr ring , forming a closed string ",

    "analysis of the kerr - sen solution to low energy string theory @xcite showed that similarity of the kerr ring with a closed strings is not only analogue , but it has really the structure of a fundamental heterotic string @xcite .",

    "kn solution was initially obtained in @xcite by a `` complex trick '' from the kerr solution .",
    "one can see that the complex radial distance @xmath31 takes in cartesian coordinates the form r = , and therefore , the scalar component of the vector potential ( [ amu ] ) may be obtained from the coulomb solution @xmath32 by a complex shift @xmath33 or by the shift of its singular point @xmath34 in complex region @xmath35 this shift was first described in 1887 by appel @xcite , who noticed that the coulomb solution , being invariant solution to the linear laplace equation by the real shifts @xmath36 should also be invariant for the complex shift . in spite of triviality of this procedure from complex point of view",

    "lind and newman showed , @xcite , that the linearized kn solution corresponds to this complex shift and may be generated by a complex source propagating along a complex world line , and suggested a special complex retarded - time procedure which generalizes the usual real retarded - time construction .",

    "it allows one to escape the anti - analytical right complex structure , replacing it by the left advanced one , and the problem is reduced to self - interaction of the retarded and advanced sources determined by the time parameters @xmath60 for any non - trivial ( not straight ) cwl , the kerr theorem will generate different congruences for @xmath61 and @xmath62 each of these sources produces a twosheeted kerr - schild geometry , and the formal description of the resulting four - folded congruence should be based on the multi - particle kerr - schild solutions , @xcite .",

    "we arrive at the result that excitations of the kerr complex string generate a calabi - yau two - fold , or k3 surface , on the projective twistor space @xmath5",
    "one sees that the kerr - schild geometry displays striking parallelism with basic structures of superstring theory . however , our principal result in this paper is the presence of inherent calabi - yau twofold in the complex twistorial structure of the kerr geometry . in the recent paper @xcite we argued that it is not accidental , because gravity is a fundamental part of the superstring theory .",
    "however the kerr - schild gravity , being based on twistor theory , displays also some inherent relationships with superstring theory .    in many respects the kerr - schild gravity resembles the twistor - string theory , @xcite , which is also four - dimensional , based on twistors and related with experimental particle physics . on the other hand , the complex kerr string has mach in common with the n=2 superstring @xcite .",
    "it is also related with twistors and has the complex critical dimension two which corresponds to four real dimensions and indicated that n=2 superstring may lead to four - dimensions .",
    "however , signature of the n=2 string may only be ( 2,2 ) or ( 4,0 ) , which caused the obstacles for embedding of this string in the space - times with minkowskian signature .",
    "up to our knowledge , this trouble was not resolved so far , and the initially enormous interest to n=2 string seems to be dampened .",
    "meanwhile , embedding of the n=2 string in the complexified kerr geometry is almost trivial task .",
    "it hints that stringlike structures of the real and complex kerr geometry are not simply analogues , but reflect the underlying dynamics of the n=2 superstring theory ,      * the spin / mass ratio of the spinning particles is extremely high which leads to the over - rotating bh geometry without horizons and offers a new application , next to traditional attention of superstring theory to quantum black holes . *",
    "the supplementary kaluza - klein space is absent , and the role of compactification circle is played by the naked kerr singular ring with traveling waves , which realizes a `` compactification without compactification '' , @xcite . *",
    "the lightlike twistorial rays are tangent to the kerr singular ring , indicating that the kerr ring is the lightlike string , and it may play the role of dlcq circle of m - theory , @xcite . *",
    "consistency of the kn solution with gravitational background of the electron , @xcite , shows that the 4d kerr characteristic length of the kerr ring , @xmath69 corresponds to the compton scale of spinning particles .",
    "the considered stringy structures of the real and complex kerr geometry set a parallelism between the 4d kerr geometry and superstring theory , indicating that complexification of the kerr geometry may serve an alternative to traditional compactification of higher dimensions .",
