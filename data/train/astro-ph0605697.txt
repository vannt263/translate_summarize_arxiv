    "* hereafter st ) refined the ps mass function by taking into account the non - spherical collapse .",
    "the st mass function has been tested against many n - body simulations , showing good agreements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this success of the st mass function implies the validity of the hierarchical merging scenario since it was originally derived under the assumption that the cdm halos form through hierarchical merging .",
    "yet it is premature to assert that the formation of cdm halos is always hierarchical over the entire mass range given the fact that the validity of the st mass function was rather limited to the relatively high- mass section ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "results from n - body simulations still suffer from the lack of information on the low - mass section ( @xmath5 ) due to the resolution limit .",
    "very recently , @xcite came up with a new halo - formation scenario where the formation of low - mass halos is somewhat anti - hierarchical , preceded by that of massive pancakes .",
    "according to their model , the preheated medium caused by the gravitational pancaking effect suppresses the star - formation sufficiently in the low - mass halos , which can explain the observed low hi - mass as well as the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function .    although the work of @xcite was focused on explaining the suppression of star - formation in the low - mass halos , we note that if the formation of low - mass halos was indeed preceded by the formation of massive pancakes , what is suppressed should not be only the star - formation but also the formation of low - mass halos itself . to take into account the _ break _ in the hierarchical process and to predict the abundance of low - mass halos more accurately",
    ", it is desirable to have an analytic model for it derived from first principles .    our goal here is to construct an analytic model for the low - mass halos that form through anti - hierarchical fragmentation of massive pancakes . to achieve this goal",
    ", we adopt the zeldovich approximation as a simplest footstep which generically predicts the formation of pancakes , and we follow the standard ps approach to count the abundance of dark halos as a function of mass .",
    "the hypotheses , the mathematical layout and the predictions of our model are presented in @xmath6 , and the summary and discussion of the final results are provided in @xmath7 .",
    "in the press - schecther formalism ( * ? ? ? * hereafter , ps ) , an _ isolated _ dark halo ( a halo just collapsed ) of mass @xmath8 forms from the regions in the density field whose average density contrast @xmath9 ( @xmath10 : the mean mass density of the universe ) smoothed on the mass scale of @xmath8 reaches some critical value , @xmath11 .",
    "the value of the critical density @xmath11 is approximately @xmath12 , which depends very weakly on the background cosmology and the redshift @xcite .",
    "the gaussian probability distribution of the linear density contrast smoothed with the sharp k - space filter on the mass scale @xmath8 is given as @xmath13 , \\quad   \\sigma^{2}(m ) \\equiv \\int^{\\ln k_{c}}_{-\\infty}\\!\\!\\delta^{2}(k)\\,d\\ln k , \\quad m = 6\\pi^{2}\\bar{\\rho}\\,k^{-3}_{c},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the rms density fluctuation , and @xmath15 is the dimensionless power spectrum . throughout this letter",
    ", we use the power spectrum of the concordance @xmath16cdm cosmology with @xmath17 @xcite .    in the zeldovich approximation (",
    "* hereafter , zel ) , the mass density is given as @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) are the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor @xmath21 defined as the second derivative of the perturbation potential @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite derived the joint distribution of the three eigenvalues : @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    equation ( [ eqn : zel ] ) implies that the mass - density diverges along the direction of the major principal axis of the deformation tensor if the largest eigenvalue reaches unity and the intermediate and the smallest eigenvalues are less than zero .",
    "in other words , an isolated pancake ( a two - dimensional object just collapsed only along the first principal axis ) of mass @xmath8 forms if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath27 with @xmath28 on the mass scale @xmath8 .    now that the conditions for the formation of isolated halos and pancakes are specified",
    ", we would like to find the probability that a halo at present epoch was embedded in a pancake at some earlier epoch before it formed .",
    "for this , it is required to have the joint distribution of the linear density and the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor on two different scales on two different epochs .",
    "let @xmath29 be defined at present epoch on the galactic mass scale @xmath30 , and let @xmath19 be defined at some earlier epoch of redshift @xmath31 on the larger mass scale @xmath32 .",
    "the rms density fluctuation at redshift @xmath33 on mass scale @xmath34 is given as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the growth factor of the linear density that is normalized to satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "since the growth factor as well as the rms density fluctuation is a decreasing function of @xmath33 , we have @xmath38 . from here on , we use the notations of @xmath39,@xmath40 , @xmath41 to represent the rms density fluctuation , the deformation tensor and its three eigenvalues at redshift @xmath33 on the mass scale @xmath34 .    to derive the joint distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath42 , we first derive the multivariate gaussian distribution of @xmath29 and the 6 independent components of the symmetric tensor , @xmath40 . rotating the frame into the principal axis of @xmath40 and using the fact that @xmath29 is invariant under the axis - rotation",

    "we consider the probability that a halo of mass @xmath30 observed at present epoch just formed hierarchically at redshift @xmath33 which is approximately given as @xcite : @xmath49^{-1 } \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^{2}_{c}}{2\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime 2}}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 represents the linear density on the mass scale @xmath30 at redshift @xmath33 . the relative difference between @xmath51 and @xmath52 indicates how probable the anti - hierarchical formation of low - mass halos is at given epoch .",
    "the direct comparison of the two conditional probabilities ( eqs.[[eqn : con1 ] ] and [ [ eqn : con2 ] ] ) is shown in fig.[fig : pan ] .",
    "the halo mass @xmath30 observed at present epoch is set at the dwarf galactic scale @xmath53 , and three different cases of the pancake s mass @xmath34 are considered : @xmath54 ( dashed ) ; @xmath55 ( solid ) ; @xmath56 ( long dashed ) .",
    "as can be seen , the value of @xmath51 is twice higher than that of @xmath52 at @xmath57 for the case of @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : panel ] also plots the two probabilities as solid and dashed lines . in this fig .",
    "[ fig : panel ] the pancake s mass is set at @xmath59 , and the four different cases of the halo mass @xmath30 are considered in separate panels : @xmath53 ( upper left ) ; @xmath60 ( upper right ) ; @xmath61 ( lower left ) ; @xmath62 ( lower right ) . as shown , the probability distribution @xmath51 has a maximum value around @xmath63 , position of which shifts to the low - redshift section as the halo mass @xmath30 increases .",
    "for all four cases of @xmath30 at @xmath64 , the value of @xmath51 is consistently higher than that of @xmath52 .",
    "the results shown in figs . [ fig : pan ] and [ fig : panel ] imply that the halo of mass @xmath65 observed at present epoch are more likely to have been embedded in massive pancakes of mass @xmath66 around @xmath63 rather than formed through hierarchical merging .    setting the typical mass scale and redshift for the formation of pancakes at @xmath67 and @xmath63 , respectively ,",
    "we follow the standard ps approach to evaluate the mass distribution function of the low - mass halos that formed anti - hierarchically . according to the theory the differential number density of the dark halos in the mass range @xmath68 $ ] is related to the volume fraction @xmath69 occupied by the proto - halo regions in the linear density field that satisfy a specified collapse condition : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the normalization factor , which is exactly @xmath72 in the original ps theory @xcite .",

    "is determined from the constraint that our mass function on the mass scale @xmath82 should give the same value as that of the st formula which is known to agree very well with n - body simulation in the mass range @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ fig : mf ] plots our result ( solid ) , and compares it with the original ps ( dotted ) and the st ( dashed ) mass functions . as can be seen , our model predicts less number of low - mass halos when compared with the ps and the st mass functions . that is , the formation of low - mass halos is suppressed by the earlier formation of massive pancakes .",
    "our mass function is found to be well fitted by a power - law , @xmath84 , which is shallower than the ps and the st ones , @xmath85 .",
    "this shallow shape of our mass function in the low - mass tail is consistent with the recent high - resolution simulation @xcite .",
    "by taking into account the possibility that the low - mass cdm halos form through anti - hierarchical fragmentation of the massive pancakes , we have derived a new analytic mass function for the low - mass halos in the @xmath16cdm cosmology with the help of the zeldovich approximation and the press - schechter mass function theory .",
    "it has been shown that our mass function has a shallower slope in the low - mass tail and predicts maximum five times less abundance of dwarf galactic halos of mass @xmath86 than the currently popular sheth - tormen formula .",
    "the concept of broken - hierarchy should modify not only the mass function but also the other halo statistics from the previous models that were constructed under the assumption that the halo formation is perfectly hierarchical .",
    "for instance , the two - point correlation of dwarf galactic halos would be different in the broken - hierarchy scenario , which in turn implies the mass - to - light bias on the dwarf galactic scale would be altered in accordance .",
    "our future work will be in the direction of investigating the effect of broken - hierarchy on the halo n - point correlations and the mass - to - light bias as well .    since our mass function has been derived analytically from first principles without introducing any fitting parameters",
    ", one may not expect it to be very realistic .",
    "the formation of low - mass halos should be dominated by complicated non - linear processes which can not be described by using first principles alone . however , as it is the first attempt to model the broken hierarchy which can accommodate future refinements , it is concluded that our model will provide a useful guideline for the theoretical study of the effects of broken hierarchy on the structure formation .",
