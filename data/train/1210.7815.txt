    "dwarf galaxies are low mass and low luminosity systems that have low potential wells .",
    "if the environment plays an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies , then , dwarfs would be the most affected systems . within the dwarfs ,",
    "dwarf early - type galaxies ( des ) are the most common population of galaxies in clusters @xcite , thus , they are excellent  laboratories  to test the mechanisms acting in these regions of high density .",
    "previous studies of des in clusters have opened a debate about the origin of these systems .",
    "their seemingly simple and round appearance caused them to be classified as the low luminosity counterparts of massive elliptical galaxies , but there is not an agreement yet in the physical interpretation of the location of des in the scaling relations of e and s0 galaxies . while @xcite claim that e / s0 and des are two different populations of galaxies finding that they follow perpendicular trends in , e.g. , the kormendy relation , other works @xcite interpret this same relation as a curvature in the properties of galaxies .",
    "the position of des on the faber - jackson and fundamental plane relations is also on dispute @xcite .",
    "these kinematic scaling relations have been traditionally used as a prove of galaxies following the same trends being the same family of objects , thus formed by the same processes @xcite .",
    "more recently these diagrams have been related to the mass - to - light ratio of the galaxies @xcite , thus , these relations also provide information about the galaxies dark matter content .",
    "observational evidence has shown a wide variety of properties for des , something not common within the e / s0 population .",
    "several photometric studies have found the presence of substructures in these galaxies , like disks , spiral arms , bars , lenses , irregular features @xcite .",
    "their surface brightness profiles follow nearly exponential laws ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) , instead of de vaucouleurs profiles ( @xmath0 @xmath2 ) as e galaxies @xcite . also , they are not composed of simple , old and metal rich stellar populations , but span a range in ages and are metal poor systems @xcite .",
    "not many mechanisms can explain together the morphology segregation and the heterogeneity of this family of galaxies .",
    "the purely internal processes , e.g. the kinetic energy generated in supernovae that sweeps away the gas of the galaxy leaving it without any fuel to create new stars @xcite , are not expected to correlate with the location of the galaxies in the universe , thus , it can not explain why des are found mainly in clusters",
    ". then , it seems more likely that external processes related to the perturbations induced on galaxies by the environment where they reside , are responsible for their formation .",
    "there are two main mechanisms proposed for that transformation of properties : harassment , i.e. the gravitational interaction between close neighbours @xcite , and ram pressure stripping , i.e. the galaxy interaction with the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "the predicted final properties of the transformed galaxies are different depending on the mechanisms affecting them . in a ram pressure stripping event the galaxy infalling the cluster lose its gas and",
    "rapidly quenches its star formation , but as this process does not directly affect the stars , their angular momentum should be conserved .",
    "galaxy harassment is a significantly more violent process that can remove a large fraction of the stellar mass , change the morphology of the galaxy , and lose a significant fraction of the angular momentum of the stars . for a review on the topic see @xcite .",
    "the kinematic analysis of des is therefore a powerful tool to identify the processes affecting galaxies in clusters .",
    "several studies have conducted similar analysis finding that some des show significant rotation while others do not @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study a sample of des in the virgo cluster , at different distances from its center , and in lower density environments with the aim of understanding the kinematic properties of these objects and distinguish between the scenarios proposed for their formation : ram pressure stripping and harassment .",

    "figures [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] show that the des have an offset with respect to the fit of e / s0 galaxies .",
    "this offset is independent from the band and also from the ages of the des and their kinematic support . in the fj relation the deviation of the des is in the same direction of the dsphs .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio seems to drive the kinematic scaling relations @xcite .",
    "when these relations are corrected for this ratio all objects , independently from their mass , follow the same fit @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if we correct for the stellar mass - to - light ratio and plot our des with respect to the fit of more massive early - type galaxies , then , the difference , if that exists , is a difference in the dark matter fraction because the total mass of a galaxy is the addition of two contributions , the stellar and dark matter .    as the virgo des do not follow the same fp as the e / s0 in the same way they do not follow the fj , we correct the fp from the stellar mass - to - light ratio . we make this correction in a similar way as it is done for the massive early - types .",
    "we assume a kroupa initial mass function and generate a grid of models of exponentially declining star formation histories .",
    "the result is @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "we apply this function to the @xmath33 values for our des by @xcite . after this correction",
    ", there is still a clear offset with respect to the e / s0 galaxies . in @xcite",
    "we use this offset to estimate the dark matter fraction of these des with respect to massive early - type galaxies , and we find that des have a dark matter fraction of @xmath34 .",
    "this value is in agreement with our previous virial mass estimation based on @xcite in combination with simple stellar population modelling using the age and metallicity as derived by @xcite .",
    "in this work we have addressed the question of where do des come from ? .",
    "the debate between des being the low luminosity extension of more massive elliptical galaxies @xcite , and des being the evolved phase of late - type galaxies in a high density environment @xcite is still open .",
    "fundamental plane corrected for stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath35 from @xcite .",
    "symbols and lines as in figure [ f2 ] . ]",
    "our kinematic analysis of a sample of dwarf early - type galaxies suggests that des have different properties from massive e / s0 galaxies .",
    "those des that are rotationally supported rotate significantly faster than e / s0 galaxies , i.e. @xmath24 is larger than the values found for e / s0 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "based on the analysis of 48 early - type galaxies , they found that none of them reaches @xmath36 , while half our sample does . in @xcite , they analyse 260 early - type galaxies and find that there is a kinematic sequence with mass , the most massive early - type galaxies do not rotate while the less massive ones are the fastest rotators .",
    "however , there is a significant fraction of des , around half of our sample , that rotate very slow or do not show any signs of rotation , thus , they do not follow this same sequence with the stellar mass of the object .",
    "moreover , the scaling relations have been historically used as an observational constraint on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the tightness of these relations has been classically interpreted as an indication that early - type galaxies constitute a homogeneous population shaped by the same formation processes @xcite .",
    "the fact that we find that des deviate from the faber - jackson and fundamental plane relations of more massive elliptical galaxies indicates that their formation must have been different .",
    "in addition , we find that this deviation is in the same direction as dsphs , and for dsphs , the most dark matter dominated systems known , the distance to the scaling relations is related to their dark matter fraction @xcite .",
    "we have used their distance to the fundamental plane to measure a @xmath34 dark matter fraction of des in comparison with es within their half - light radius .    on the other hand , there are many similarities between des and late - type galaxies . from a purely photometric point of view , both des and late - type galaxies have exponentially declining surface brightness profiles @xcite .",
    "in addition , des are also a very heterogeneous group of galaxies , showing underlying structures like disks , spiral arms and irregular features , although there is a significant fraction of them that have smooth and regular surface brightness profiles @xcite . in the case of their stellar populations , des",
    "are not simple , old and metal - rich galaxies as e / s0 , they expand a wide range in luminosity - weighted ages , from 1 to 12 gyr , and they are metal - poor @xcite . in our kinematic study of des in the virgo cluster we have found that the rotational support of these galaxies depends on their distance to m87 , considering this galaxy as the center of the cluster .",
    "those des in the outer parts of the cluster are rotationally supported while those concentrated around m87 are pressure dominated .",
    "we have also found that the rotationally supported des have rotation curves with the same shape and amplitude of late - type spirals of the same luminosity , they have disky isophotes , disky underlying features , and their ages are around 3 gyr younger than those des in the center of the cluster , which have boxy isophotes and do not have any underlying substructure .    from this study",
    "the differences between des and e / s0 galaxies and the similarities between des and late - type galaxies are highlighted .",
    "therefore , it has helped us to have a better understanding of the origin of these systems .",
    "the correlation of the spectrophotometric properties of these des with their distance to the center of the virgo cluster rules out an internal mechanism as the procedure to form this kind of galaxies ( i.e. supernovae explosions sweep away the gas of the galaxy leaving it without fuel to create new stars @xcite ) , and it points towards an environmental process . within the different external processes , ram pressure stripping explains all the properties of the rotationally supported des . in a ram pressure stripping event ,",
    "the late - type galaxies infalling into the cluster lose their gas and become quiescent galaxies quite rapidly just through their interaction with the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "this mechanism only affects , in the short term , the gas of the galaxy leaving the kinematic of the stars untouched , thus , one would expect that the kinematic properties of quiescent galaxies affected by ram pressure stripping to be the same as late - type galaxies of the same luminosity , which is what we have found for those des in the outer parts of the virgo cluster . however , those des surrounding m87 are more difficult to explain . their lack of rotation and substructures suggest that they might have suffered a more violent event than just ram pressure stripping , but , their older ages also suggest that they have been longer in the cluster , thus their several passes through the center could have shaped them , but , which is the physical mechanism of a transformation in a very high density region ? .",
    "harassment , the interaction of a galaxy with its neighboring objects , is the main candidate . it is significantly more violent than ram pressure , but simulations of galaxy harassment suggest that this process is only effective near the cluster center .",
    "@xcite simulates the outer parts of the virgo cluster and finds that harassment is not strong enough to transform low luminosity late - type galaxies into des because of the lack of a high number of neighbours . in the center of the cluster",
    "this mechanism is much more efficient but still it is not enough as to explain the properties of des nearby m87 . in the simulations of @xcite",
    "although @xmath37 of the stars are tidally stripped in the interaction , a strong underlying spiral structure remains after the event , while no substructure if found in the des located in the central parts of the cluster .",
    "thus , it looks like a combination of ram pressure stripping and harassment is helping to shape these non - rotating des in the center of the cluster , but a piece of the puzzle is still missing to fully explain the spectrophotometric properties of des in the center of the virgo cluster .    in summary , many are the properties that make des look alike to late - type galaxies . the kinematic properties of des in the virgo cluster suggest that these are late - type galaxies that entered the cluster and have been transformed into quiescent objects . the physical mechanisms that make the transformation are clear for those des found in the outer parts of the virgo cluster , their properties agree with a ram pressure stripping event",
    ". however , the characteristics found for des in the center of the cluster make their origin more intriguing . a combination of ram pressure and harassment has affected these galaxies in their travel through the cluster , but , these mechanisms are not enough to explain their lack of rotation and underlying substructure .",
    "we are conducting new observations with a larger coverage in radial kinematic profiles to throw some light in this direction .",
