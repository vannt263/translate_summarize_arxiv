    "two important forms of carbon , fullerene ( c@xmath0 ) and carbon nanotubes , are closely related to each other by their structural commonality of the sp@xmath3 framework .",
    "carbon nanotubes have been widely investigated for the last decade or so as one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanomaterial @xcite .",
    "in contrast , fullerene 1d nanostructures , such as c@xmath0 nanowires , presently represent laboratory curiosities @xcite .",
    "c@xmath0 nanowires are highly interesting nanomaterials because of the physical properties associated with their high surface area , low - dimensionality and quantum confinement effects @xcite . in comparison with carbon nanotubes",
    ", however , c@xmath0 nanowires are mechanically fragile and electrically non - conducting on account of the large intermolecular spaces in the crystalline lattice although an individual c@xmath0 molecule is extremely hard , almost incompressible and electronically fully conjugated across all the carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "it is expected that , in contrast to their parent nanowires or individual fullerene building blocks , polymerized c@xmath0 nanowires will exhibit remarkably different and/or improved physical properties owing to the formation of polymeric chains and interchain cross - linking networks . from an applications point of view",
    ", a major advantage of using such polyfullerenes would be their bio - compatibility as they are totally free of metal .",
    "notably , this clearly contrasts to the case of carbon nanotubes , the growth of which is catalyzed by metal nanoparticles , and from which by no means all the metal can be removed by post - purification processes @xcite . in this respect",
    ", c@xmath0 nanowire polymers could be biologically even more attractive than carbon nanotubes for uses in , for example , drug delivery and biosensor preparation @xcite .",
    "additionally , 1d c@xmath0 polymers are conjugated or nearly - conjugated materials that promise outstanding photo - electrical properties because of the large magnitude of the nonlinear optical response of c@xmath0 and its excellent photoinduced charge transfer behaviour @xcite . as such",
    ", they promise applications as optical limiters and photoconductors for solar energy devices , fuel cells , and field - emission transistors @xcite .",
    "all this makes them important materials for further study .",
    "fundamental to the development of applications is the question of how to make such metal - free , c@xmath0-based nanowire polymers ? in seeking to answer this question , we note first that a limited number of polymerization reactions of c@xmath0 have been reported in literature @xcite . for example",
    ", it has been shown that the polymerization of thin solid films of c@xmath0 may occur upon irradiation with visible - uv light . in this case , the thin - films were prepared by vacuum deposition of pure c@xmath0 on a substrate @xcite . on the basis of raman scattering studies , such polymerization has been hypothesized to result from a [ 2 + 2 ] cycloadduction linkage between adjacent c@xmath0 molecules in the structure @xcite .",
    "single crystals of kc@xmath0 , prepared by the co - evaporation of k and c@xmath0 , have undergone polymerization via formation of the same [ 2 + 2 ] structure motif , but the whole polymer is a linear polyanion network , as suggested by electron spin resonance ( esr ) measurements , pointing to a possible donation of electrons from k atoms to the polymer chains @xcite .",
    "an in - chain metal - fullerene ( -pdc@xmath0-)@xmath1 polymer , synthesized by the reaction of c@xmath0 with a palladium complex , pd@xmath4[(c@xmath5h@xmath6ch = ch)@xmath4c = o ] chcl@xmath7 , has been noted @xcite .",
    "moreover , side - chain c@xmath0 copolymers formed through the attachment of c@xmath0 to amino polymer substrate have also been reported , with the coupling of c@xmath0 to the amino polymer being analogous to that observed for amines @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that crystallization of c@xmath0 molecules from organic solvents yields c@xmath0 nanocrystals with varied shapes and structures , and that these shapes and structures are dependent upon the crystallization conditions and the solvent(s ) employed @xcite .",
    "one example is the preparation of c@xmath0 nanowhiskers with a claimed face - centered cubic structure using a liquid - liquid interface method @xcite .",
    "this method has also been extended to prepare the nanowhiskers of c@xmath8 , iodine - doped c@xmath0 , and the c@xmath0-based complex of ( @xmath9-c@xmath0)pt(pph@xmath7)@xmath4 @xcite . in the second example , crystallization of c@xmath0 molecules from a 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene ( 1,2,4-tmb ) solution of c@xmath0 has been found to be able to produce exceptionally long c@xmath0 nanowires under appropriate conditions , with a length - to - width aspect ratio as large as 3000 , and an orthorhombic nanostructure @xcite .    in spite of these literature reports , it is clear that there has been little study in the related field of nanowire - oriented c@xmath0 polymer .",
    "this new class of 1d nanomaterial exhibits similarities in structure to other important conjugated polymers such as polyacetylenes , polyanilines , and polyphenylenes .",
    "here we report the synthesis and characterization of such a c@xmath0-based nanowire polymer , ( -c@xmath0tmb-)@xmath10 , which is formed by the polymerization occurring in their parent nanowire via a topochemical solid - state reaction . because the reactive monomers are pre - organized at a distance commensurate with the repeat distance in the final polymer , the application of thermal or photochemical energies to the solid induces polymerization . in order to understand the polymerization pathway , we have employed gas chromatography ( gc ) , mass spectrometry ( ms ) and @xmath2c nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy to investigate the nature of the bonds formed during the polymerization process . additionally , to explain the polymerization mechanism in more detail we have theoretically analyzed the associated molecular orientations , structural arrangements and the favorable reaction pathways .",

    "the laser power employed was kept as low as possible , and optical microscopic examinations were carried out for the nanowires before and after each measurement .",
    "the structures and properties of the molecules involved in the nanowire polymerization process were studied theoretically .",
    "the calculations were performed with the gaussian 03 software package @xcite , within the framework of the _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) . within the framework of the dft one has to solve the kohn - sham equations @xcite , which read as ( in the atomic system of units ) :    @xmath17    here the first term represents the kinetic energy of the i - th electron , and @xmath18 describes its attraction to the ions in the system , while @xmath19 is the hartree part of the interelectronic interaction :    @xmath20    and @xmath21 is the electron density :    @xmath22    @xmath23 in eq .",

    "the local exchange functional is virtually always defined as follows :    @xmath27    this form was developed to reproduce the exchange energy of a uniform electron gas . by itself , however , it is not sufficient for an adequate description of a many - body system .",

    ", one has to admit that the hartree - fock theory accounts for the electron exchange more naturally and precisely .",

    "@xcite ) .    in the calculations we accounted for all electrons in the system , and employed the standard sto-3 g , 6 - 21 g and 6 - 31g(d ) basis sets @xcite .",
    "the sto-3 g and 6 - 21 g basis sets were used for geometry optimization and energy calculation , while the 6 - 31g(d ) was used for simulating the nuclear magnetic resonance properties .    we have calculated chemical shielding tensors for different molecules of interest and compared the results with experimental measurements . according to nmr theory , the chemical shielding tensor can be computed as the second derivative of the electronic energy @xmath51 with respect to the external magnetic field @xmath52 and the nuclear magnetic moment of interest @xmath53 :    @xmath54    indices @xmath55 and @xmath56 correspond to the @xmath55-th and @xmath56-th components of the vectors @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",

    "the presence of chemical shielding anisotropy often generates broad powder patterns , but in this case the magic - angle spinning ( mas ) technique can be used to partially or completely average the chemical shielding anisotropy powder patterns .",
    "another important quantity is the chemical shift @xmath65 , which is defined as the difference in shielding between the nucleus in the species under investigation , @xmath66 , and the shielding of the same nucleus in a reference compound , @xmath67 :    @xmath68    the latter approximation is often used because usually @xmath69 .",

    "the gc peaks at 1.34 minutes in ( a ) and 1.36 minutes in ( b ) are attributable to the remnant of ccl4 solvent , and the peaks at 2.93 or 2.95 minutes in the spectra are due to an impurity present in the system.,width=604 ]    synthesis of the fullerene nanowire polymer required that we first prepared c@xmath0 nanowires using a 1,2,4-tmb solution of c@xmath0 by a previously described method @xcite .",
    "we noted that the resulting nanowires were highly stable , as indicated by the fact that there was no detectable alteration in either their crystalline morphology , crystal color , or sample weight as a function of time .",
    "however , the solubility of the material was found to change with time . unlike raw c@xmath0 powder ,",
    "well known to be highly soluble in aromatic solvents , the as - made nanowires were only partially soluble in these solvents , and this solubility decreased further with time .",
    "after ageing for a period of @xmath7010 months , the nanowires became totally insoluble in common organic solvents including benzene , toluene , 1,2,4-tmb , and carbon tetrachloride .",
    "this initial observation led us to speculate that a polymerization reaction might have occurred within the system , and that this had led to interesting new physical and chemical properties , including excellent thermal stability and solvent - resistant behavior .",

    "the profiles ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the gc peaks at 2.80 and 3.10 minutes ( elution times ) as shown in figure [ fig1]a.,width=604 ]    observation of the loss of solubility was consistent with the results obtained from the gc - ms analysis .",
    "tests were carried out using two suspensions of the solid in ccl@xmath71 , corresponding respectively to as - made and aged nanowires .",
    "prior to the tests , the solids were resident in the solvent for 5 days .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "as can be seen , gc successfully isolated 1,2,4-tmb molecules from the suspension containing the as - made nanowires , as indicated by the signals at 2.80 and 3.10 minutes ( see figure [ fig1]a ) .",
    "the mass spectra of these eluent fractions , shown in figure [ fig2 ] , confirmed the presence of trimethylbenzene in both isomeric forms : the main gc peak ( at 2.80 minutes ) corresponded to 1,2,4-tmb , while the smaller peak ( at 3.10 minutes ) corresponded to either 1,3,5-tmb or 1,2,3-tmb , which existed as impurities in the solvent .",
    "the major ions in the mass spectra were seen at 120 , 105 , 91 and 77 da and were consistent with those expected from trimethylbenzene .",
    "in contrast , no tmb molecules could be extracted from the aged solid , as confirmed by the absence of the corresponding gc peaks from the spectrum ( see figure [ fig1]b ) .",
    "these data support the observation of partial solubility behavior of the as - made solid , suggesting a possible partial polymerization in the sample , which appears to arise from the slow - growth of the nanowires .",

    "some assignments are immediately suggested by a comparison with the spectra of the pure precursor materials , namely , the pristine c@xmath0 ( see figure [ fig3]a ) and pure 1,2,4-tmb ( see figure [ fig3]b ) .",
    "the broad peak at 22.5 ppm in the as - prepared c@xmath0tmb adduct ( see figure [ fig3]c ) results from the three methyl groups of 1,2,4-tmb ( 19.8 , 20.2 and 21.5 ppm ) , the signal at 129.9 ppm in the same spectrum to protonated benzyl carbons of the adducted 1,2,4-tmb ( c.f",

    "to illustrate this fact , in figure [ fig10 ] we show how the the distance between two fullerenes in a c@xmath0-tmb - c@xmath0 complex depends on an angle @xmath80 , which is defined as the separation degree between the planes formed by atoms ( 1)-(2)-(3 ) and atoms ( 2)-(3)-(4 ) , as shown in the figure .",
    "as the bonds connecting two c@xmath0 units and a tmb@xmath74 are not collinear , the center - to - center distance changes upon rotation of the fullerenes . as can be seen from figure [ fig10 ] , such a distance varies from 11.5   to 14.5  , and match the distances between fullerenes in the unit cell ( as indicated in figure [ fig9]a ) .",
    "-tmb - c@xmath0 complex as a function of angle @xmath80 , which is defined as the angle between the planes formed by the atoms ( 1)-(2)-(3 ) and ( 2)-(3)-(4 ) , as shown in the inset.,width=604 ]    based on this geometrical analysis , we have noted that there appear to be three possibilities for fusing a tmb@xmath74 molecule in between two fullerenes in the unit cell , as illustrated by the three sets of c@xmath0 dimers marked in figure [ fig11]a . except these possibilities , the distances between any other two fullerenes are either too small or too large and are thus incompatible with the requirement for a topochemical polymerization to occur . note that although the distance 16.4 in the unit cell is somewhat larger than the distances shown in figure [ fig10 ] , the related fusion mode is still possible because the distance between fullerenes in a c@xmath0-tmb - c@xmath0 complex may further change at certain conditions .",
    "some deviations are expected because the c@xmath0-tmb - c@xmath0 complex was optimized in vacuo without accounting for other related constituents in the polymer .",
    "also , the complex has many isomers because in the crystal unit cell a fullerene has many different atomic sites to which a tmb@xmath74 molecule may attach .",
    "tmb complex ( a ) , and the 3c@xmath0tmb complex ( b ) , in the unit cell of the parent nanowire .",
    "distances are given in ngstroms and correspond to experimental data @xcite.,width=604 ]    similarly , figure [ fig11]b shows two possible fitting sites for a 3c@xmath0tmb complex in the unit cell .",
    "this structural analysis clearly demonstrates that a 1,2,4-tmb molecule can easily stitch two fullerenes together within a nanowire without disturbing the lattice structure .",
    "this conclusion is in excellent agreement with the experimental studies with sem , hrtem and saed , as described earlier .",
    "our experimentally measured chemical shifts are supported by the calculated values as shown by figure [ fig3]e . to do the calculation , we have applied the _ ab initio _ b3lyp/6 - 31g(d ) method to pristine c@xmath0 ( dotted line , red fill ) , pure 1,2,4-tmb ( dashed line , green fill ) and the c@xmath0-tmb - c@xmath0 complex ( solid line , blue fill ) . since many of the calculated chemical shifts are degenerate , lorentzian broadening for each line",
    "is assumed :    @xmath81    here @xmath82 is the calculated chemical shift , and @xmath83 is the width of peaks at half maximum intensity .",
    "the calculated @xmath2c - nmr spectra are plotted on a logarithmic scale for better visualization .",
    "the calculated chemical shifts for pure c@xmath0 and 1,2,4-tmb are in good agreement with experiment . the observed signal for c@xmath0 at 143.3",
    "ppm is only 4 ppm higher than the calculated , and the calculated shift for the ring carbons of tmb is only 7 - 8 ppm lower than the observed .",
    "also , the calculated values for the methyl groups perfectly reproduce the measured data ( within an error of less than 1.0 ppm ) .",
    "these comparisons enable us to conclude that the accuracy of the calculation is on the order of @xmath705 - 8 ppm , which is sufficient for an unambiguous characterization of the calculated nmr peaks in this work .    in the previous section we suggested that the c@xmath0-tmb - c@xmath0 complex was a building block in the polymerization .",
    "the calculated @xmath2c - nmr spectrum for the complex strongly supports this view by virtue of its excellent agreement with the experimental result .",
    "crucially , the emergence of four peaks in the range of 45 - 80 ppm , consistent with the observed set of broad peaks at 55 - 85 ppm , corresponds to the chemical shifts of the carbon atoms ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , respectively , as marked in figure [ fig3]f .",
    "these three atoms participate in the bonds formed between c@xmath0 and 1,2,4-tmb molecules in the polymerized network .",
    "c - nmr spectra calculated for three isomeric states of the tmb - tmb dimer using the _ ab initio _ b3lyp/6 - 31g(d ) method .",
    "the geometries of the molecules used in the calculation are shown in the inset .",
    "labels indicate the chemical shifts of different types of carbon atoms in the system .",
    "note that the chemical shifts in ( c ) are much more degenerate than ( a ) and ( b ) due to the enhanced symmetry of the studied isomer.,width=604 ]    the observed peak at 30.4 ppm can be interpreted as the response from methylene carbons cross - linking adjacent 1,2,4-tmb molecules due to polymerization .",
    "this view is strongly supported by literature report of the structurally closely - related framework of multi - substituted diphenylmethane ( see table [ tab1 ] ) @xcite . within the accuracy of the calculation ,",
    "it is also consistent with our calculations for tmb - tmb dimers , which predict the corresponding chemical shift to be in the range of 28 - 43 ppm , depending on the bonding mode adopted by the dimers and the relative orientations of the adjacent tmb molecules involved ( see figure [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig12]a shows an example of a dimer in which the two benzene rings are perpendicular to each other , and the two tmb molecules are bonded together through two methylene carbons corresponding to the ring positions of 1- and 4-methyl , respectively . in this case , the two methylenes yield two closely placed peaks at 35.7@xmath847 ppm and 37.8@xmath847 ppm .",
    "figure [ fig12]b shows another example of a dimer in which the two tmb molecules are linked by only one methylene carbon which exhibits a chemical shift of 38.4 ppm .",
    "figure [ fig12]c shows the third example of such a dimer isomer , where the two tmb molecules are linked by two identical methylene carbons but the two benzene rings are parallel to each other . in this case the chemical shift calculated is 43.4 ppm .",
    "these analyses suggest that the chemical shift of the methylene carbons is sensitive to the surrounding atoms , and that the peak observed at 30.4 ppm hint at some specific bonding mode and/or relative orientations between tmb molecules in the polymeric chains",
    ". moreover , the enthalpy calculated for such a dimerization reaction using the b3lyp/6 - 21 g method is -19.2 kcal / mol , indicating that the dimerization reaction for polymerization is energetically favorable .",
    "we have demonstrated for the first time an approach to the synthesis of a c@xmath0-based nanowire polymer and established the chemical bonding mode involved in the polymeric chains based on both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations .",
    "importantly , the material adopts a crystalline 1d nanostructure which resembles carbon nanotubes in shape and other important conjugated polymers in structure .",
    "since the material does not contain any metal but is simply composed almost entirely of carbon ( while it contains hydrogen , the content is only 1.4 wt % ) , it suggests biological compatibility and it is , perhaps , even more attractive than carbon nanotubes for bio - applications . in addition , the material has further important potential for applications in photo - electrical devices because of the intrinsically large magnitude of the nonlinear optical response of c@xmath0 and the excellence of its photoinduced charge transfer properties .",
    "considering all these , we believe that this work represents a step toward true applications of c@xmath0 in nanotechnology by the ability of processing commercially available raw c@xmath0 powder into a one - dimensional , crystalline , and covalently - bonded fullerene nanopolymer .",
    "we consider that applications of the reported nanopolymer may be facilitated by a wet - chemical approach through surface modification of the material using the rich chemistry of fullerene developed over the last 20 years .",
    "since the nanopolymer is insoluble in common solvents , such surface modification or functionalization should be possible to achieve in either an aqueous or an organic solution without destructing its solid - state structure .",
    "such a wet approach would benefit from low - cost processing , the need for only simple apparatus and the possibility of scaling - up to the industrial level .",
    "moreover , the nanopolymer itself not only provides an example of phase transition of the parent nanowire driven by forming and breaking covalent bonds , but also illustrates the enduring significance of the original fullerene concept and its versatility as applied to new fullerene - related nanostructures .",
    "finally , the host ( c@xmath0 ) and guest ( 1,2,4-tmb ) nature of the polymerization suggests a general host - guest route to the synthesis of new types of fullerene - based nanopolymers constructed by different organic monomers and fullerenes .",
