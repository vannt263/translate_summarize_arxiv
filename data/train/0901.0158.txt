    "the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is a fascinating topic in condensed matter physics and quantum information science .",
    "qpts distinctively from temperature - driven critical phenomena occur due to the competition between different parameters describing the interactions of the system , and qpts occur only at zero temperature @xcite . in the second - order qpt ,",
    "the ground state undergoes qualitative changes when an external parameter passes through the quantum critical points ( qcps ) .",
    "the qcps are characterized by the divergence in the correlation length , which leads to the critical scaling behaviors governed by a class of universal exponents @xcite . in principle , experimental observations of qpts could be achieved at zero temperature @xcite . however , in practice , it is difficult to realize since cooling matter to zero temperature is impossible in any experiment . hence , recently , the finite - temperature properties of qpt systems begin to attract more attention @xcite . in their results ,",
    "the quantum criticality can persist up to a surprisingly high temperature . however , the critical behavior at finite temperature is not exact but a remanent of that at zero temperature .",
    "some divergent physical quantities at the qcp , e.g. , the magnetic susceptibility in the one - dimensional spin-1/2 transverse field ising model ( tfim ) , become convergent and shifted away from the qcp in the parameter space at finite temperature @xcite .    on the other hand , besides the ground state , the dynamic properties of qpt systems also cause a lot of interests zurek , dziarmaga , sengupta , anatoli , greiner , sadler , sachdev , silva , zhu , qs .",
    "actually , the zero - temperature static properties are naturally and intimately linked to the dynamic process , in which many excited states are involved . as we know , the scaling exponents are dependent on the effective dimensionality , which is the sum of the dimension and the dynamic exponent @xcite . for the adiabatic approach of the qpt system to the qcp , the variation of parameter needs to slow down to infinitesimal @xcite .",
    "so the ground state at the qcp could not be achieved adiabatically .",
    "differently , quench dynamics can pass through the qcp without any restriction . in experiments , the quench dynamics of the bose - hubbard model have been performed with ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite . quench dynamics and their critical behaviors in the tfim are also investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , none of them discussed the effect of temperature on these critical behaviors .",
    "the quench dynamics relate to all of the eigenstates more than just the ground state , so the quench dynamic properties at the qcp should not be as sensitive to temperature as those of the ground state .    with these motivations , in this paper , we study the quench dynamics of the tfim with zero - temperature and finite - temperature initial states .",
    "initially , the system is modulated to be with a transverse field strength @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the field strength is suddenly changed to @xmath2 and the system begins to evolve coherently . here",
    ", we use the magnetization per spin in the transverse field direction @xmath3 to characterize the state at time @xmath4 . after a long enough time evolution ,",
    "the off - diagonal contributions to @xmath5 are cancelled with each other @xcite , and @xmath6 achieves a steady value finally .",
    "the final asymptotic magnetization is @xmath7which is called the quench magnetization in this paper . to make the above formula more easily tractable mathematically , we write it as @xcite @xmath8",
    "we will show that @xmath9  as well as its derivatives , the magnetic susceptibilities @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 , exhibit critical behaviors when @xmath14 or @xmath2 passes through the qcp . for a zero - temperature initial state ,",
    "the susceptibility @xmath15 diverges logarithmically and exhibits scaling behaviors  when @xmath0 is in the vicinity of the qcp . for an initial state with temperature @xmath1 ,",
    "the susceptibility @xmath16 experiences a jump @xmath17 when @xmath2 is at the qcp , where @xmath18 is the energy gap between the ground and first excited states of the initial system . the jump @xmath19 achieves maximum when @xmath1 turns to zero .",
    "since this jump is not sensitive to @xmath1 and the operations are not restricted by adiabatic conditions , the quench dynamic process has the advantage to study critical behaviors of qpt systems without the rigorous restriction of zero temperature .",
    "the tfim is a famous model for studying the second - order qpts .",
    "it is exactly solvable and useful for verifying many new concepts and methods .",

    "actually , in the strong - field limit @xmath72 , the transverse field term is dominant , which keeps the conservation of the expectation value of the total spin component in the transverse field direction during the quench process .",
