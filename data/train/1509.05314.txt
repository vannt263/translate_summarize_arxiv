    "galaxy collisions and interactions play an important role in the local universe in driving powerful star formation activity in galaxies , and the generation of powerful emission in the infrared @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength studies of local galaxy populations have shown that nearly all ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs with l@xmath10 @xmath9 10@xmath11 l@xmath6 ) involve mergers of gas - rich galaxy pairs @xcite .",
    "similarly , nearby luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs with l@xmath10 @xmath9 10@xmath12 l@xmath6 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , often involve strongly interacting and sometimes merging systems .",
    "numerical models @xcite have emphasized the importance of strong tidal torques , which can act to drive gas into the centers of galaxies , initiating nuclear enhancements in star formation . despite two decades of study of these galaxies , there are still many uncertainties about how to realistically model the complex astrophysical environment of a powerful major merger @xcite .",
    "many questions remain .",
    "for example , what is the the dependence of the star formation triggering on the physical conditions in the gas , especially the effects of feedback from young stars , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) winds , or other processes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "do all deeply penetrating gas - rich mergers inevitably lead to powerful star formation and luminous infrared activity ?",
    "there are examples of major mergers where the gas has been disturbed significantly , but is still in a pre-(u)lirg phase .",
    "the ` antennae ' system ( ngc 4038/39 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is only just classified as a lirg , and yet clearly contains large amounts of gas in the overlap region which have not fully developed their star forming potential .",
    "clues to this are seen in the recent high - resolution study of co(32 ) with alma by @xcite , where peculiar velocities and compact linear filaments of co gas are seen : likely the result of turbulence . in the current paper",
    ", we discuss another possible example of a galaxy pair , the taffy ( total l@xmath13 = 4.5 @xmath1 10@xmath14 l@xmath6 ) , that has recently experienced a head - on collision but has yet to display strong global star formation enhancements .",
    "the taffy galaxies , ugc 12914 and ugc 12915 ( vv254 , kpg603 ) were discovered to be connected by a bridge of radio continuum emission ( figure 1a ) and neutral hydrogen gas @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the two galaxies have recently interpenetrated , creating a common magnetic field between them as they moved apart after the collision . in this picture ,",
    "cosmic rays ( crs ) generated within the galaxies , would flow into the common halo generating radio synchrotron radiation .",
    "@xcite showed that the logarithmic ratio of the far - infrared to radio continuum flux @xmath15 is 1.94 , unusually low for normal galaxies ( @xmath16 = 2.3 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that _ in situ _ shock acceleration of cosmic rays in the bridge can explain the strength of the radio emission and radio spectral index .",
    "in this view , the galaxies do not need to be the source of cr electrons , because the crs can be accelerated within the highly turbulent conditions in the bridge @xcite .",
    "further evidence that shocks may play an important role in the material in the bridge was presented by @xcite , who showed that the bridge contains @xmath9 4.5 @xmath1 10@xmath17 m@xmath6 of warm ( 150 @xmath18 t @xmath18 175 k ) molecular hydrogen .",
    "the excitation of this warm intergalactic gas was found to have a strong heating contribution from shocks and turbulence .",
    "the detection of broad co ( 10 ) lines in the bridge @xcite is consistent with turbulent gas and kinetic energy dissipation in this colder component .",
    "this could provide a significant fraction of the heating needed to maintain the warm h@xmath7 for the @xmath825 myrs since the collision @xcite .",
    "while @xcite were able to demonstrate that the warm h@xmath7 emission was likely the result of turbulent or shock  heating of the bridge , they could not rule out heating of the molecular gas by x - rays , since , at that time , no observations of this kind had been made .",
    "one of the consequences of a head - on collision between the two galaxies is the possibility of the sweeping of gas out of the galaxies .",
    "the large amounts of gas found in the bridge ( @xmath87 @xmath1 10@xmath19 m@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has to survive the violence of the collision @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the gas and stellar dynamical modeling of the taffy collision by @xcite , it was shown that momentum transfer between the gas clouds in the galaxies during the collision was sufficient to transport large quantities of gas into the bridge .",
    "the model also provided a possible explanation for the spatial offset in the distribution of the dense molecular gas , and the diffuse hi in the bridge @xcite .",
    "this was explained as a consequence of the two galaxies colliding slightly off - center , leading to an asymmetry in the density structure of the resulting bridge .",
    "the models did not include the thermal balance of the different phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the galaxies , which is especially relevant to x - ray observations .",
    "hot x - ray emitting gas can extend outside galaxy disks through both internal and external processes .",
    "in starburst galaxies , supernova explosions can create hot bubbles of x - ray emitting gas that can break - out of their host molecular disks , and push gas into the halo @xcite .",
    "large scale shocks can also heat gas to x - ray temperatures in the intergalactic diffuse environment . in the 40 kpc - long filament in the stephan s quintet galaxy group ,",
    "x - ray emission was detected in association with a giant shock structure @xcite .",
    "the filament also contains copious amounts of warm and cold molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the emission is consistent with the model of @xcite in which a large - scale shock is propagated into a multi - phase medium . in this model ,",
    "the low density regions of this medium become heated to x - ray temperatures , whereas the higher density clumps collapse and can survive the initial disturbance and radiate strongly in the mid - ir h@xmath7 lines .",
    "shocked regions can also radiate strongly in diffuse [ cii ] emission , as observed @xcite .",
    "similarly powerful mid - ir h@xmath7 , [ cii ] , and [ oi ] emission have been seen in the taffy system ( peterson & appleton , in preparation ) , providing further motivation for the current study of the taffy system in x - rays .    in this paper",
    ", we detect faint soft diffuse x - rays from the taffy galaxy disks and bridge region , as well as from a number of luminous discrete sources .",
    "we explore various explanations for the observed x - ray emission , favoring shock  heating as the most likely explanation for the diffuse emission .",
    "we assume a distance to the galaxies of 62 mpc based on the heliocentric velocities for ugc 12914 and ugc 12915 of @xmath20 and @xmath21 km",
    "s@xmath3 respectively , and a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the taffy galaxies were observed for 39.5ks on 2013 february 3 ( obsid 14898 ; pi p. appleton ) with the back - illuminated ccd chip , s3 , of the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we processed the observation using ciao version 4.6 ( calibration database 4.6.4 ) to create a level2 events file , following the software threads from the _ chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "most of the images , covering a 4.1 x 4.1 arcminute@xmath22 field with a pixel scale of 0.492 arcsec pixel@xmath3 are shown for the @xmath23@xmath24kev range , but we also examined smaller energy ranges , including soft ( @xmath23@xmath25kev and @xmath23@xmath26kev ) , medium ( @xmath25@xmath26kev ) , and hard ( @xmath26@xmath24kev ) bands .",
    "we created smoothed images in two ways .",
    "first , we smoothed with a simple @xmath27 gaussian kernel with the saoimager ds9 @xcite .",
    "second , we used the ciao task dmimgadapt to adaptively smooth images .",
    "dmimgadapt smooths each pixel on the scales necessary to reach the desired count threshold ( selected to be 10 counts ) under its convolution kernel or the maximum kernel size , which we set to 5@xmath28 .",
    "we also created images of the diffuse emission by removing point sources , dividing by the exposure map , and then adaptively smoothing the cleaned image ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "point source identification was done using the ciao task wavdetect @xcite , a mexican - hat wavelet source detection program .",
    "these sources , except for the plausible centers of the galaxies , were then cleaned using the task dmfilth , which replaces source pixel values with values determined by interpolating the surrounding background .",
    "we used the specextract task to extract x - ray spectra in the 0.38.0kev range for several extraction apertures in the taffy system , including the two galaxies and the bridge , after excluding the point sources .",
    "a background spectrum was simultaneously extracted in the same chip in a sourceless region , and automatically scaled based on the ratio of the source - to - background areas .",
    "we filtered the events based on the energy range and then grouped it to a minimum of 20 counts per bin prior to modeling the spectrum .",
    "for the two bridge sub - regions as well as the extragalactic hii complex ( see section 3 ) , we estimate the flux and luminosities based on the count rates , assuming the model parameters from the total bridge .      the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath29 m observations shown in this paper were obtained from the spitzer heritage archive ( pi : j. r. houck ; observid 21 ) and had been processed through the s18 ssc pipeline .",
    "a constant background was removed from the image before extracting fluxes from the extended regions .",
    "the _ herschel _ photometry data at 70 , 100 and 160@xmath29 m was de - archived from the herschel science archive ( pi e. sturm , proposal name kpgt@xmath30esturm@xmath301 , obsids 1342212798/9 ) as level 1 data , which are fully calibrated frames . these scan and cross - scan data were then further processed through the mapping package scanamorphos ( roussel 2013 ) , kindly made available to us by the author . additionally , we obtained _ herschel _ [ cii]157.7@xmath29 m line data as part of our ot1 program pacs spectroscopy program ( pi : p. appleton , proposal ot1@xmath30pappleto@xmath301 , obsid 1342238415 ) .",
    "these data were processed on a large virtual machine through a version of hipe 13 @xcite available at the nasa herschel science center .",
    "the integrated line map shown here was created in hipe after first removing baselines from all the individual spaxels in the image , and then integrating over the range of velocities in which signal was detected .",
    "full details of the reduction of the [ cii ] data will be provided in a separate paper devoted to the pacs spectroscopy of the taffy system ( peterson & appleton , in preparation ) .",
    "we show in figure 1b and 1c two different representations of the observations . in figure 1b , we show the compact x - ray structure present in the 0.58 kev image of these data .",
    "we detect nine bright point - like sources at high significance above background , and numerous fainter ones .",
    "an additional extended source , is coincident with the peak of the radio continuum emission in the nucleus of the south - western galaxy ugc 12914 ( and 2mass k - band emission - not shown ) .",
    "in contrast , the north - eastern galaxy , ugc 12915 , contains several point - like x - ray sources , but none of them seem to be directly associated with the galaxy s radio continuum and near - ir light peak .",
    "1c shows clearly the detection of extended emission in the bridge region , but it is somewhat offset from the radio continuum bridge to the north - west .    to quantitatively describe the x - ray properties of the various features seen in the x - ray images , we define in figure 2a several extended polygon - shaped regions , as well as identifying the point sources .",
    "for the extended regions , polygons define both galaxies and the bridge , which is divided into two parts .",
    "the x - ray properties of the galaxies are given in table 1 , along with coordinates , aperture description , net counts ( after taking into account the background model ) , and total x - ray flux ( 0.58 kev ) and luminosity .",
    "the luminosities are derived from model fits to the x - ray spectra ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities ( 0.58 kev ) of ugc 12914 and ucg 12915 ( excluding the point sources ) are 1.66 and 1.15 @xmath110@xmath31 erg s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "if we add the contribution of the compact sources within their disks ( see next section ) , ugc 12914 and ugc 12915 have total luminosities of 3.2 and 2.2 @xmath110@xmath31 erg s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "therefore , the compact sources contribute significantly to the total x - ray luminosities of the galaxies .    in table [ soft ] , we present the observed soft ( 0.52 kev ) x - ray fluxes for the extended polygon regions .",
    "we measure a total x - ray luminosity over the the full bridge of l@xmath32 = 4.7 @xmath1 10@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "most of the soft x - ray emission from the bridge comes from region bridge-1 , with a surface x - ray brightness of 5.7 @xmath1 10@xmath33 erg s@xmath3 @xmath34 arcsec@xmath35 .",
    "this is only a little less that the average surface brightness of the soft x - ray emission from the two galaxies .",
    "the region called `` hii '' , which we consider separately from the bridge ( figure 2a ) , is dominated by the compact source b1 , but may also include some extended emission .      figure",
    "2a and figure 2b shows two kinds of labeled point sources .",
    "those with yellow circles e1-e5 ( in ugc 12915 ) , w1-w3 ( in ugc 12914 ) , and b1 in the bridge , are all detected at a 3-sigma level of significance .",
    "the level of detection significance is based on poisson noise estimates , taking into account the estimated ( generally low ) background counts detected in addition to the sources .",
    "these sources , which are strongly detected , are listed individually in table 1 .",
    "we further identify 15 sources ( labelled as red circles in figure 3 ) which are detected at a lower level of significance ( 2 - 3@xmath36 ) .",
    "these sources have net counts in the 1.5 - 2 arcsecs extraction apertures of between 4.5 and 10 .",
    "formally they represent significant detections , but their x - ray luminosities are poorly determined because of poisson noise .",
    "we list the properties of these sources in table [ compact ] .",
    "how many of the fainter sources would we expect in the area of the bridge ( @xmath81 arcmin@xmath35 ) by chance ? based on an exploration of larger adjacent fields on the chip , and by simulating an additional component representing the added ( randomly distributed ) count rate from the diffuse taffy - bridge emission , we would expect 0.3 sources arcmin@xmath35 with a count rate @xmath9 4 in a 1.5 arcsec extraction aperture .",
    "this number is consistent with the expected number of agn ( 0.5 sources arcmin@xmath35 ) based on a detection threshold of close to 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath37 erg s@xmath3 @xmath34 @xcite . considering the larger area of the whole taffy system",
    ", we conclude that no more than one of the fainter sources is a chance association : most appear to be real detections .    to investigate how their properties might influence our estimate of the extended soft x - ray emission from the bridge , we identified them by eye and flagged them for removal in the smoothed images .",
    "as can be seen by comparing figure 2c with figure 2d , the effects of the removal of these additional sources is small , reducing the net flux in the soft band by only an additional 20@xmath4 . in what follows , we present results based on the extended emission with only the more reliable 3@xmath36 sources removed .",
    "we estimate the flux of each 3@xmath36-detected source assuming a power law with a photon index of @xmath38=1.7 @xcite .",
    "their luminosities ( table 1 ) put them in the range of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; commonly associated with star forming galaxies * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such sources are usually assumed to be massive accreting black - holes ( m@xmath39 @xmath40 20 m@xmath6 ) associated with young star clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the majority of the compact sources being associated with the disks of both galaxies , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "several are concentrated around the inner region of ugc 12915 , and some of the fainter sources seem loosely associated with the bright spiral arm in ugc 12914 , seen in visible light .",
    "the numbers of brighter sources are also consistent with the average number of ulx s as a function of star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "@xcite estimate that for gas - rich galaxies , there is , on average , 0.5 ulxs for every 1 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 of sfr .",
    "based on the sfrs for the two galaxies discussed in section 5.1 , we estimate that ugc 12914 and ugc 12915 should contain 2 and 5 ulxs ( l@xmath41 @xmath9 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , which is close to the actual number of 3@xmath36 sources found in the two disks . unlike @xcite , who studied a sample of interacting galaxies , we do not see a significant enhancement in ulxs compared with normal spirals in this system .",
    "the brightest ulx source ( b1 ) lies outside the disk , to the south - west of ugc 12915 , and has an x - ray luminosity of l@xmath0 = 3.0 @xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this bridge source is associated with a massive molecular rich cloud - complex ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is the only region outside the galaxies detected in h@xmath42 and pa@xmath42 images @xcite .",
    "we estimate that this extragalactic hii region complex ( labelled as `` hii '' in figure 2a ) has a sfr @xmath8 0.25 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 ( section 5.1 of this paper ) based on its ir emission .",
    "it also lies close to a peak in the radio emission in the bridge seen in figure 1a . as such ,",
    "the discovery of a single ulx in this complex is interesting , as it lies outside either of the two galaxy disks and lies near the densest part of the molecular bridge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and braine et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the failure to detect the source in hard x - rays probably also rules out a chance association with a background agn .",
    "although no age estimate is available for the source ( it is highly obscured in visible and uv light ) , the escape of emission of h@xmath42 light suggests a young stellar population is present .",
    "if this `` extragalactic hii region '' was formed by a compression of gas in the bridge , it would only have had 1020 myrs to form",
    ". however , this is feasible , since berghea et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have shown that the ages of typical massive star clusters associated with ulxs are typically 10 myrs old .",
    "a more detailed study of the correlation between the position of taffy b1 and the host molecular cloud and associated star - formation would be worthwhile .",
    "in addition to b1 , several fainter sources lie in the bridge ( b2 - 5 ) .",
    "although we can not completely rule of a chance association with a background source , the concentration of these fainter sources is interesting .",
    "as figure 3 shows , the sources fall in the region where faint dusty filaments are seen in the optical image  suggesting heavy obscuration , and they fall well within the main region of the molecular bridge ( section 4 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that these sources represent fainter versions of b1 , and are associated with obscured star formation within the bridge . unlike b1 , there is no clear association of these sources with optical counterparts .",
    "the slightly extended source `` w@xmath43 '' lies in the nucleus of ugc 12914 , and contains a significant fraction of the x - ray luminosity of the whole galaxy .",
    "this source is the only source detected in the 28 kev band , with a hard x - ray luminosity l@xmath44 = 1.1@xmath450.2 @xmath1 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath3 ( luminosity calculation assumes an x - ray power - law of slope @xmath38 = 1.7 ) .",
    "previous observations @xcite of the galaxies with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) failed to detect spectroscopic evidence of an agn from either of the taffy galaxies .",
    "formally , it has a hardness ratio ( hr ) of  -0.06@xmath450.11 , the most positive of any source in the system ( all the others have upper limits ) , but lower than typical agn ( hardness ratios in the range 0.70.9 )",
    ".    the elevated hardness ratio of w@xmath43 may indicate that ugc  12914 contains a low luminosity agn , accreting at a sub - eddington rate @xcite .",
    "despite having only 90 net counts , we have simulated how the hr varies over a range of power - law slopes and intrinsic hydrogen column densities . within the range allowed by a 2@xmath36 uncertainty in hr , a typical source with 1.7  @xmath18  @xmath38 @xmath18  1.9 , would require a range of possible absorbing columns of 0.3 - 1 @xmath1 10@xmath46 @xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with an agn with moderate intrinsic absorption .",
    "however , given the small number of detected counts at higher - energy , we can not completely rule out a highly - obscured , compton - thick agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although such a source in isolation would exhibit a much larger hardness ratio than observed , the hr might be lowered by the addition of a thermal component from extended nuclear star formation , or shocks which would soften the spectrum as the agn became more obscured . a conclusive test of whether ugc 12914 contains a compton - thick agn would require deep observations from a telescope sensitive to x - rays beyond 10  kev .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether the compact sources are consistent with the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of populations of compact x - ray sources found in other nearby systems .",
    "for example , @xcite performed an in - depth study of @xmath8120 compact x - ray sources discovered in the ` antennae ' system @xcite , and was able to determine the xlf down to limits of 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath3 , a factor of @xmath830 times fainter than the sources discovered in the taffy .",
    "their results were consistent with the brighter sources ( ulxs ) being an extension to high mass of a fainter population of x - ray binaries accreting close to their eddington limits .",
    "figure 4 shows the cumulative xlf determined for the compact sources ( cyan line bracketed by black uncertainty boundaries ) .",
    "the luminosity function of the cumulative source number counts can be approximated by a power - law of the form n(@xmath9l ) = al@xmath48 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "n(@xmath9l ) is the number of sources with luminosity greater than l , a is a normalization factor , and @xmath42 is the slope of the assumed relationship .",
    "following @xcite , we binned the luminosities of the 2 and 3-sigma sources in intervals of the natural unit of counts ( one count converts closely to a unit of 1.25 @xmath1 10@xmath49 ergs s@xmath3 at a distance to taffy of 62 mpc ) .",
    "we calculated the luminosities of the fainter compact sources in the same manner as the brighter sources ( assuming a power - law spectral index of 1.7 ) .",
    "the xlf shows a smooth transition from the brighter ( 3-sigma sources ) to the fainter ( 2-sigma ) sources , suggesting that they form a continuous population . also plotted , to provide additional information , are the differential counts as green and red squares in figure 4 .",
    "given the small numbers of total sources ( we only have 25 in all , and only 9 above 3@xmath36excluding w@xmath43 ) , we did not attempt to fit the slope of the xlf , nor did we attempt to correct for completeness in the fainter sources .",
    "rather we simply compare our data with results from the deeper survey of zezas et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the average @xmath42 = 0.55 determined for the full deep ` antennae ' survey ( purple line ) .",
    "this slope is dominated by the many fainter sources ( l@xmath50 @xmath18 10@xmath49 erg s@xmath3 ) in the ` antennae ' , which is characteristic of the massive x - ray binary population .",
    "it is clear from the comparison that taffy sources appear to follow a steeper slope .",
    "however , although it might be tempting to speculate that the taffy source may be powered by something other than massive x - ray binaries , the steepness is very likely a consequence of small number statistics in our sample .",
    "indeed the same effect was found by zezas et al .",
    "when they fit these same ` antennae ' data with a split power law .",
    "these authors showed that sources brighter than l@xmath50 @xmath9 7.5 @xmath1 10@xmath47 erg s@xmath3 ( this would be the case for all our sources ) could be fit with an @xmath42 = 1.35 ( red line ) .",
    "this slope is much more consistent with the taffy sources . as zezas et al .",
    "describe in their paper , the steeper slope is most likely an artifact poor statistical sampling at the bright end of the xlf , and the potentially rapid variability of fluxes found predominantly in the higher - luminosity sources .",
    "given , in our case , the additional uncertainty in the fluxes of the fainter sources , we conclude that our data are consistent with the sources being the tip of the luminosity function of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "for the galaxy extractions and the bridge ( the sum of extracted regions bridge-1 and bridge-2 of figure 2a ) , we have enough counts to spectrally model these regions .",
    "spectral modeling was done using the sherpa packages of ciao , having first removed the 3@xmath36 point sources . for the diffuse emission in the galaxies and bridge , we fit combinations of apec thermal models ( astrophysical plasma emission code ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a power - law .",
    "solar metallicity is assumed .",

    "we also tried adding intrinsic absorption as a free parameter .",
    "the results are given in table [ fits ] .",
    "in addition to the name of the region ( column 1 ) and the model type ( column 2 ) , table [ fits ] also provides the apec normalization factor n@xmath52 ( column 3 ; proportional to the volume emissivity of the apec  modeled plasma ) , thermal temperature kt ( column 4 ) , power - law flux density at 1 kev ( column 5 ) , power - law index @xmath38 ( column 6 ) , best - fitting intrinsic hi absorption column density  if allowed to be non - zero ( column 7 ) , and the normalized minimum @xmath53 of the final fit ( @xmath53/n ) , where n is the number of degrees of freedom in the model .    in figure 5",
    ", we plot x - ray spectra from the observations , and over - plot the models .",
    "the spectra of the diffuse emission in ugc 12914 and ugc 12915 ( figure 5a and b ) were best fit by a combined apec and power - law fit .",
    "for ugc 12914 , we fitted a thermal component at 0.71(@xmath450.25)kev , and a power law model with a photon index of @xmath38 = 2.3(@xmath451.5 ) .",

    "we note that the differences in the normalized minimum @xmath53 for the fit , with and without a power - law , is not large .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that inclusion of a power - law component in the modeling is physically reasonable , because an extrapolation of the xlf of the observed compact sources to fainter flux levels implies the existence of population of faint power - law sources which would appear as a diffuse component when averaged together = 10@xmath49 erg s@xmath3 and find that the expected unobserved luminosity from massive x - ray binaries is within a factor of two of the power - law component of the two galaxies measured from the spectral modeling . ] . to improve the signal to noise of the modeling ,",
    "we have also summed the signal from both galaxies , and re - fit the resulting spectrum ( figure 5c ) . as table [ fits ] shows ,",
    "a significantly improved fit was found for the summed galaxies .",
    "we consider the apec+power - law fit to be the most reasonable with a new power - law index that is closer to that expected for the brighter point sources .",

    "this is contrary to all the other previous published work .",
    "we believe that the most likely explanation for the discrepancy is that unlike normal galaxies , the taffy galaxies contain significant quantities of gas shock - heated in the collision , rather than all originating from supernova heating .",
    "we already noted the odd distribution of hot gas in ugc 12914 , suggesting that much of the emission may be from bridge - gas , and this may explain why this system is more luminous in soft x - rays than its companion .",

    "section a in figure 9 , passes through the nuclear regions of both galaxies , whereas section b is offset from the centers but passes through the brightest parts of the bridge .",
    "these cross - sections show that the soft x - ray emission has a complex distribution , and does not follow a simple exponential profile expected if both galaxies had winds .",

    "clumps of soft emission are seen in either side of the disk of ugc 12914 , but the emission again runs into a distinct bridge structure .",

    "returning to the bridge , we also find the average star formation rate across region bridge-1 m emission alone and using the method of calzetti et al .",

    "given that in normal galaxies , the x - ray luminosity is expected to scale roughly as sfr@xmath72 @xcite , then if the bridge x - rays were created in a normal galactic environment , they should be at least ten times fainter .",
    "however , as table [ soft ] shows , the soft x - ray surface brightness in the bridge-1 region is only a factor of two to three times less than the disk surface brightness .",
    "alternatively , we can predict the expected star formation rate in the bridge based on the correlation derived for normal galaxies by @xcite .",
    "based on this prediction , if star formation dominated the bridge x - ray emission , it should have a sfr of @xmath8 2.8 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 , whereas we measure it to be ten times smaller .",
    "therefore normal _ in situ _ star formation in the bridge is unlikely to be the origin of the x - rays .",
    "observations with _ spitzer _ @xcite revealed the existence of an unusually large amount of warm molecular hydrogen in the bridge .",
    "this was attributed to mechanical heating of the molecular gas by turbulent energy dissipation left over from the direct collision of the two galaxies . however , before discussing shocks further , it is worth ruling out a more mundane explanation for the abundance of warm h@xmath7 : that the molecular gas is heated because it is bathed in a strong x - ray field .",
    "@xcite could not rule this out , since until the present work , no previous x - ray observations had been made .",

    "this luminosity is almost certainly a lower limit to the total power emitted in the rotational hydrogen lines , since higher order transitions where not observed ( they fell outside the wavelength range of the long - low grating ) . summing the line luminosities over bridge regions b , c , d , e , j , k , l , m ( as defined by * ? ? ?",

    "if we adopt the values of stellar mass from the sed fitting , the correlation of @xcite would predict depletion times of log(t@xmath91 ) = 9.1 and 9.0 respectively for ugc 12914 and ugc 12915 with a 1-@xmath36 scatter of dex 0.27 .",
    "the observed value of log(@xmath87 ) for ugc 12915 is therefore well within the main distribution for normal galaxies , and ugc12914 deviates by only 1.9@xmath36 from the mean relation ( on the star formation deficient side ) .",
    "we conclude that , unlike the bridge , the taffy galaxies have depletion times ( and star formation efficiencies ) that are within the normal range for their gas content . nevertheless , their @xmath87 values are an order of magnitude longer than those of lirgs @xcite .",
    "the most likely reason that the taffy galaxies have not yet become strong ir emitters , despite having recently undergone a major gas - rich collision , is the geometry of the head - on collision .",
    "this has strongly disrupted the gas , splashing it @xcite into the bridge where much of it is still turbulent .",
    "the bridge gas still contains large quantities of warm h@xmath7 , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as a significant component of hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "in addition , there has not been enough time since the collision ( 25 myrs ) for the bridge gas to fall back onto the disks , which might eventually lead to more activity .",
    "@xcite pointed out the existence of a ring structure in ugc 12914 , probably arising from the same process that leads to collisional ring galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the geometry of the taffy system is such that both galaxies might be expected to form radially expanding rings within their disks in this nearly face - on collision .",
    "it is possible that the ulxs in ugc 12915 are part of a forming gas - rich ring , seen edge - on .",
    "for example , in @xcite , more than a dozen ulxs were discovered associated with the main expanding star forming ring of the cartwheel collisional galaxy .",
    "as @xcite showed , collisional ring galaxies are rarely bright enough to be lirgs , partly because the star formation is confined to a narrow ring ( or multiple rings ) , and generally does not form a strong nuclear starburst .",
    "we conclude that the peculiar near - central collisional geometry , combined with strong gas stripping , has predisposed the taffy galaxies to be less active than a more typical major merger .",
    "the x - ray observations of the taffy galaxies and bridge , combined with new _ herschel _",
    "data , have shown the following main results :    * x - ray emission is detected from both galaxies and from the bridge regions of the taffy system .",
    "the galaxies themselves contain both compact point - like sources and extended soft x - ray emission .",
    "* nine ulx ( l@xmath50 @xmath8 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) , and potentially more fainter point - like sources , are found in the taffy system , and the brightest ulx ( l@xmath0 = 2.8 @xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) lies in the bridge , close to the position of a giant extragalactic hii region which is associated with a peak in the molecular gas density in the bridge .",
    "an additional , slightly extended source with a harder x - ray spectrum , is found associated with the nucleus of ugc 12914 , perhaps hinting at the existence of a buried agn .",
    "the number of ulxs in the two galaxies scales roughly with the sfr , as found in previous studies , suggesting that these x - ray sources are generated in massive x - ray binary systems , with an evolution that is intimately tied to massive star formation .",
    "this is consistent with the shape of the xlf for the compact sources . *",
    "extended x - ray emission , l@xmath0 = 5.4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 , is found primarily in the north - western part of the bridge .",
    "the total mass in hot gas is ( 0.81.3 )  @xmath1  10@xmath5  m@xmath6 , which is approximately 1@xmath4 of the total ( hi  +  h@xmath7 ) gas mass in the bridge , and @xmath811@xmath4 of the mass of warm molecular hydrogen discovered by _",
    "spitzer_. it is more closely associated with far - ir emitting diffuse gas and dust , than with either the brightest ridge of radio continuum emission seen in the bridge or with the distribution of denser gas tracers in the bridge . the lack of obvious correlation with the brighter radio continuum emission in the bridge rules out a direct connection between the x - rays and the synchrotron emission in the bridge caused by cosmic rays . *",
    "we show , using full sed fitting including _ herschel _ far - ir data , that the star formation rate ( 0.24 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 ) , is too low in the bridge to explain the relatively high x - ray surface brightness detected there .",
    "furthermore , only ugc 12915 has a global star formation rate comparable with previously studied minor - axis x - ray outflow galaxies , and the x - ray surface brightness profiles are quite dissimilar to galaxies with known x - ray outflows .",
    "we favor shock heating from the galaxy collision as the main source of x - rays .",
    "the offset distribution of the diffuse gas tracers ( including the x - ray emission ) from the dense gas tracers in the bridge , may be the results of an off - center collision between the two galaxies .",
    "* we suggest that the shock - heating of low - density material in the precursor ism of both galaxies has been splashed out ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into the bridge along with other diffuse gas leaving a highly turbulent bridge unable to support much star formation .",
    "the properties of the x - ray bridge implies that the gas is only just beginning to cool significantly in the 25 myrs since the collision when it was likely first shocked .",
    "the temperature of the extended soft x - ray emitting gas is consistent with heating by shocks of over a range of 430 to 570 km@xmath3 depending on the assumed intrinsic absorption in the x - ray spectral modeling .",
    "these values are similar to the impact velocities assumed for the head - on collision that has led to the bridge formation .",
    "the pressure in the hot gas is found to be much lower than the implied pressure in the warm h@xmath7 , as expected from models of supersonic turbulence which predict rapid cycling of molecular material through many different phases in the post - shocked region . *",
    "the luminosity of the x - ray emission is 42 times lower than the mid - ir line  luminosity of warm h@xmath7 emission seen in the bridge by _",
    "spitzer _ in previous observations .",
    "the new _ chandra _ observations thus rule out the x - rays themselves as being the heat - source for the 10@xmath59 m@xmath6 of warm molecular gas in energetic grounds . exploring",
    "the importance of x - ray heating of the molecular gas in the bridge was an important motivation for this study . *",
    "the combination of _ herschel _ photometry , with full sed fitting , implies normal gas depletion times for the two taffy galaxies ( implying normal star formation efficiencies ) but an extremely long depletion time ( @xmath910 gyrs ) for the gas bridge .",
    "star formation therefore seems suppressed in the bridge where warm h@xmath7 and x - ray emitting gas have not yet cooled , and velocity dispersions remain high in the molecular gas .",
    "we suggest that the reason the taffy system is not a strong ir - emittor ( as with many other major gas - rich mergers ) is related to the collisional geometry , which has stripped and disrupted a large amount of the gas into the bridge .",
