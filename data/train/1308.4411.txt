    "the temperature of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) represents a fundamental quantity describing the physical state of the majority of baryons in the universe . in the standard paradigm",
    ", the thermal state of the low - density igm , which gives rise to the forest in quasar spectra , is set primarily by the balance between photo - ionisation heating and adiabatic cooling . at redshifts",
    "well after reionisation completes , this should result in a well - defined power - law relationship between temperature and density , @xmath8 , for overdensities @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . during and immediately following hydrogen or helium reionisation ,",
    "in contrast , the temperature - density relation will become multi - valued and spatially dependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that additional heating processes , such as volumetric heating by tev emission from blazars , may modify this picture ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the precise heating mechanism , however , the long adiabatic cooling timescale at these low densities , @xmath10 , means that the igm retains a long thermal memory . the temperature - density ( @xmath1@xmath2 )",
    "relation can therefore serve as a powerful diagnostic of the reionisation epoch and the properties of ionising sources in the early universe ( e.g. @xcite )    over the last decade there have been many attempts to measure the thermal state of the low density igm using the forest .",
    "these measurements may be broadly classed into two approaches : statistical techniques which treat the forest transmission as a continuous field quantity ( @xcite ) and those that instead decompose the forest absorption into discrete line profiles ( @xcite , hereafter rsp12 ) .",
    "these studies have produced a variety of results , not all of which are in good agreement .",
    "the tension between the measurements has historically remained relatively weak , however , as the statistical and/or systematic uncertainties have often been large .",
    "recently , however , two studies based on large data sets have claimed to measure temperatures in the igm at @xmath11 to high ( @xmath1210 per cent ) precision , but with apparently discrepant results .",
    "the first was by @xcite , who analysed the curvature of the transmitted flux in the forest over @xmath13 .",
    "this study measured the temperature at a characteristic overdensity , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 evolved with redshift . at @xmath11",
    ", they found @xmath16 \\times 10^{4}\\rm\\,k$ ] ( 2@xmath17 error ) at @xmath18 .",
    "more recently , rsp12 reported a measurement of the @xmath1@xmath2 relation at @xmath19 using line profiles in a large set of high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra obtained as part of the keck baryonic structure survey ( kbss , @xcite ) .",
    "they measured a temperature at mean density , @xmath20\\times 10^{4}\\rm\\,k$ ] , and a power - law slope , @xmath21 ( 1@xmath17 errors ) for their `` default '' outlier rejection scheme .",
    "the rsp12 results imply a temperature at the density probed by @xcite of @xmath22 \\times 10^{4}\\rm\\,k$ ] ( 1@xmath17 , including the errors in both @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , which is discrepant with the @xcite value at over the 2@xmath17 level .",
    "stated differently , for the @xcite value of @xmath14 to be consistent with the rsp12 value of @xmath23 would require @xmath25 , which is at odds with the rsp12 result for the slope of the @xmath1@xmath2 relation .",
    "obtaining consistent measurements of the igm @xmath1@xmath2 relation at @xmath11 would be a considerable step towards establishing the full thermal history of the high - redshift igm , which is intimately related to hydrogen and helium reionisation and to the characteristics of ionising sources .",
    "for example , the value for the slope of the @xmath1@xmath2 relation advocated by rsp12 is in good agreement with that expected for an optically thin , post - reionisation igm , where the temperature is set by the balance between adiabatic cooling and photo - heating only .",
    "this implies there may be no need for the additional heating processes which have been invoked to explain the observed probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the forest transmission at @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one possible avenue towards reconciling the @xcite and rsp12 results is to re - examine the calibrations underlying their temperature results . @xcite",
    "employed a suite of hydrodynamical simulations to convert their curvature measurements to temperatures at a specific overdensity .",
    "rsp12 obtained their measurement of the @xmath1@xmath2 relation using the velocity width - column density ( @xmath4@xmath3 ) cut - off technique developed by @xcite ( hereafter s99 ) .",
    "this latter approach is based on the premise that the lower envelope of the @xmath4@xmath3 plane arises from gas which follows the @xmath1@xmath2 relation of the igm .",
    "s99 used hydrodynamical simulations to establish and calibrate the relationship between the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off and the @xmath1@xmath2 relation .",
    "in contrast to the original s99 analysis , however , rsp12 obtained their measurements using an analytical expression for the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the assumption that absorption lines at the @xmath4@xmath27 cut - off are thermally broadened .    in this work",
    "we revisit the calibration of the @xmath4@xmath27 cut - off technique used by rsp12 .",
    "specifically , we use a large set of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the igm to test the robustness of the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 advocated by rsp12 based on their measurement of the lower cut - off in the @xmath30@xmath3 distribution .",
    "our goals are two - fold .",
    "firstly , we wish to confront the analytical approach adopted by rsp12 with detailed simulations of the igm . secondly",
    ", using these simulations , we may assess whether the rsp12 measurement is consistent with other recent results , or whether there is genuine tension between measurements of the igm thermal state at @xmath26 obtained using transmission statistics and line decomposition techniques .",
    "we note that this redshift range represents an excellent starting point for establishing a consensus picture of the thermal state of the high - redshift igm , for multiple reasons .",
    "first , it is after the end of helium reionisation ( e.g. @xcite ) , when the @xmath1@xmath2 relation at low densities can reasonably be expected to follow a power law .",
    "second , excellent high - resolution spectra covering the forest can be obtained from bright quasars .",
    "critically , the forest is also relatively sparse at these redshifts , enabling a largely straightforward decomposition of the forest into individual absorption lines and thus an analysis of the temperature as a function of density using the @xmath4@xmath27 cut - off technique .",
    "we begin by providing a brief overview of the numerical simulations and methodology in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and a discussion follows in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "a numerical convergence test of the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off measured in the simulations is presented in an appendix .",
    "in order to calibrate the relationship between the observed @xmath30-@xmath3 cut - off and the igm @xmath1-@xmath2 relation , we utilise cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed using gadget-3 ( @xcite ) . the bulk of the simulations used in this study are described by @xcite ( see their table 2 ) . in this work",
    "we supplement these models with four additional runs which explore a finer grid of @xmath29 values .",
    "this gives a total of 18 simulations for use in our analysis , all of which have a box size of @xmath31 comoving mpc , a gas particle mass of @xmath32 and follow a wide range of igm thermal histories characterised by different @xmath1-@xmath2 relations .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted in the simulations are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , with a helium mass fraction of @xmath39 .",
    "we shall demonstrate later our results remain insensitive to this choice by instead using the recent planck results ( @xcite ) .",
    "mock forest spectra are extracted from the simulations from outputs at @xmath40 and are processed to match the rsp12 observational data ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mean transmitted flux , @xmath41 , of the spectra is matched to the recent measurements presented by @xcite .",
    "the simulated data are then convolved with a gaussian instrument profile with @xmath42 and rebinned onto pixels of width @xmath43 to match the keck / hires spectrum characteristics of rsp12 .",
    "finally , gaussian distributed noise is added with a total signal - to - noise of @xmath44 pixel , matching the mean @xmath45 of the rsp12 data .      the procedure used for measuring the",
    "@xmath4@xmath3 cut - off in the simulations follows the method described in s99 and rsp12 .",
    "we use vpfitrfc / vpfit.html ] to fit voigt profiles to our mock forest spectra .",
    "we then select a sub - sample of the lines using the `` default '' rsp12 selection criteria : only absorbers with @xmath46\\leq 100 $ ] , @xmath47\\leq10^{14.5}$ ] and relative errors of less than 50 per cent are included .",
    "we furthermore ignore all lines within @xmath48 of the edges of our mock spectra to avoid possible line duplications arising from the periodic nature of the simulation boundaries .",
    "we note , however , that we opted not to use the additional @xmath17-rejection scheme introduced by rsp12 .",
    "we found this procedure did not work effectively when applied to models with @xmath4@xmath3 distributions which differed significantly from the rsp12 data .",
    "we therefore always compare to the rsp12 `` default '' measurements throughout this work .",
    "the power - law cut - off at the lower envelope of the @xmath30@xmath3 plane , @xmath49 , is then measured in each of our simulations by applying the iterative fitting procedure described by s99 to @xmath50 absorption lines selected following the above criteria ( the full rsp12 sample contains @xmath51 absorbers ) .",
    "uncertainties on @xmath52 and @xmath53 are estimated by bootstrap sampling the lines with replacement @xmath50 times .",
    "once the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off has been measured in the simulations , the @xmath1@xmath2 relation may then be inferred by utilising the ansatz tested by s99  namely that power - law relationships hold between @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath30 for absorption lines near the cut - off , such that ,    @xmath54    @xmath55    substituting these expressions into the @xmath1@xmath2 relation and comparing coefficients with the power - law cut - off , @xmath56 , we identify ,    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 when @xmath60 is the column density corresponding to gas at mean density .",

    "the power - law relationship between the gas at the lower boundary of the @xmath1@xmath2 plane , shown by the red dashed lines , is estimated by finding the mode of the gas temperature in density bins of width 0.02 dex at @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "however , the value of @xmath61 in the simulations , indicated by the red diamond in the middle panels , is @xmath82 dex smaller than the value used by rsp12 , shown by the blue circle .",

    "( [ eq : schaye01 ] ) is weak , this difference is mainly due to the low value of @xmath76 rsp12 used to estimate @xmath60 .",
    "this was based on the results of @xcite , who inferred @xmath85 from the forest opacity assuming an igm temperature at mean density of @xmath86 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as @xcite correctly point out , the forest opacity constrains the quantity @xmath87 , and so assuming a larger ( smaller ) igm temperature from the forest power spectrum after calibrating their measurement with a dark matter only simulation performed with a ( now ) outdated cosmology . since @xmath88",
    ", it is therefore not entirely coincidental that the rsp12 constraint on @xmath23 is similar to the measurement presented by @xcite . ] at mean density will translate their constraint into a smaller ( larger ) value of @xmath85 if the opacity remains fixed .",
    "in addition , @xcite obtained their @xmath85 measurements using an analytical model for igm absorption which ignored the effect of redshift space distortions on the forest opacity . including peculiar velocities and line broadening , as we do with our simulations ,",
    "raises the @xmath85 required to match a given value of the mean transmission in the forest by up to 30 per cent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xcite measurements are therefore systematically lower ( by a factor of two or more ) compared to the value we require to match our mock spectra to the mean transmission measurements of @xcite if @xmath89 .",

    "although the agreement between the analytical model and simulations is still not perfect and @xmath90 are slightly different quantities , and this comparison is thus not exact . ] , the higher @xmath85 values result in a significantly improved correspondence .",
    "we therefore conclude that the value @xmath74 assumed by rsp12 is biased high by @xmath82 dex .",
    "as we will demonstrate , this bias translates into a significant overestimate of @xmath28 .",
    "finally , note that the 68 ( 95 ) per cent bounds on the range of optical depth weighted overdensities probed by absorption lines with column densities @xmath81 \\leq 10^{14.5}$ ] are @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) at @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off approach will be largely insensitive to the slope of the @xmath1@xmath2 relation outside this range of overdensities .",

    "additionally , the six simulations s99 analysed all used different assumptions for cosmological parameters and the igm thermal history , which further complicates a direct comparison .",
    "a final possibility is that there are differences in the version of vpfit s99 used to fit the absorption lines .",
    "the results presented by s99 already indicated that the assumption of purely thermal broadening may result in an overestimate of the gas temperature , but our analysis suggests that the factor by which the velocity widths of the lines at the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off are actually increased by non - thermal broadening is rather small .     ( upper panel ) and slope @xmath53 ( lower panel ) of the @xmath4@xmath112 cut - off against the corresponding @xmath23 and @xmath29 from @xmath113 hydrodynamical simulations .",

    "finally , @xcite , again using the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off ( although with a different method to @xcite ) , infer @xmath161 at @xmath162 . although these authors do not present a measurement of @xmath23 , using their measurement of @xmath163 this corresponds to @xmath164 .",

    "[ fig : pdf ] we revisit this by comparing the pdf of the transmitted flux from two of our hydrodynamical simulations to three observational measurements of the forest transmission pdf from high resolution ( @xmath169 ) data at @xmath170@xmath171 ( k07 , @xcite ) .",
    "the mock spectra have been drawn from models with a @xmath1@xmath2 relation with either @xmath79 or @xmath172 at @xmath173 , and have a @xmath23 value close to the revised measurement obtained in this work .",
    "the spectra have been processed following a similar procedure to that outlined in section  [ sec : sims ] , with two key differences .",
    "firstly , the spectra are scaled to match the mean transmission of the k07 pdf data , @xmath174 at @xmath175 , and gaussian distributed noise matching the variances , @xmath176 , in each bin of the k07 pdf is added .",
    "secondly , for each model we also implement an iterative continuum correction to the spectra to mimic the effect of a possible continuum placement error on the k07 data .",
    "we first compute the median transmitted flux in each of our mock sight - lines and then deselect all pixels below @xmath177 of this value .",
    "this procedure is then repeated for the remaining pixels until convergence is achieved .",
    "the final median flux is selected as the new continuum level .    the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] demonstrates a @xmath1@xmath2 relation with @xmath79 is inconsistent with the k07 data at @xmath140@xmath178 at @xmath179 , even when accounting for possible continuum misplacement ( although see the analysis presented by @xcite using an analytical model for the transmission pdf ) . an isothermal model on the other hand is in within @xmath180@xmath166 of the k07 data over the same interval .",
    "this is fully consistent with the more detailed analysis performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note , however , that @xcite recently argued that the error bars quoted on the k07 pdf measurements may be larger by up to a factor of two simply due to sample variance ; these authors demonstrated the bootstrap or jack - knife errors on the data will be underestimated if the chunk size which the spectra are sampled over is too small .",
    "comparison of the three observational measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] likewise suggests that the errors on the pdf measurements have been initially underestimated .    the lower panel in fig .",

    "although the difference between the simulation and data is still @xmath181@xmath166 at @xmath182 after accounting for a plausible continuum placement error .",

    "estimated from mock spectra drawn from the gimic simulation suite ( @xcite ) assuming @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "@xcite conclude there is no evidence for a significant departure from a power - law @xmath1@xmath2 relation with @xmath188 .",
    "the remaining disagreement between the observations and a model with @xmath79 suggests that increased errors due to continuum placement and sample variance may still not fully account for the true uncertainties on the observational data .    in this context",
    ", it is worth stressing that the transmission pdf and @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off are sensitive to a different range of igm gas densities and hence also temperatures .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] displays the relationship between the optical depth weighted overdensity and transmitted flux in each pixel of the spectra drawn from the simulation with @xmath79 , shown in the left panel . for comparison ,",
    "the red dashed ( blue dot - dashed ) lines bound 68 ( 95 ) per cent of the overdensities probed corresponding to absorption lines with @xmath189 \\leq 10^{14.5}$ ] ( i.e. the range used to measure the @xmath30@xmath3 cut - off at @xmath167 ) .",
    "interestingly , the largest differences between models and observations of the pdf arise almost exclusively in the underdense regions which are not well sampled by the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off measurements .",
    "furthermore , note that the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off is only sensitive to the coldest gas lying along the lower bound of the @xmath1@xmath2 plane ( e.g. s99 ) .",
    "it therefore remains possible that a more complicated , multiple valued @xmath1@xmath2 plane with significant scatter and/or a separate hot igm component confined to the most underdense regions , @xmath190 , may also influence the shape of the pdf at @xmath185 .",
    "indeed , recent radiative transfer simulations of reionisation predict significant scatter or even bimodality in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane at @xmath191 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more detailed studies of both the pdf and the @xmath4@xmath3 distribution over a wider redshift range , combined with simulations which have increased dynamic range and/or incorporate radiative transfer effects , will therefore be required to establish the importance of these effects .",
    "we have performed a careful calibration of the measurement of the @xmath1@xmath2 relation in the low - density igm at @xmath192 .",
    "our analysis is based on the @xmath4@xmath3 cut - off measured from mock forest spectra drawn from an extensive set of high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations , combined with accurate measurements of the mean transmitted flux in the forest ( @xcite ) and the kbss line profile fits from rsp12 .",
    "we confirm the high value of the power - law slope , @xmath29 , at @xmath0 advocated by rsp12 , but we find a value for the temperature at mean density , @xmath28 , which is smaller by almost a factor of two .",
    "the latter is mainly due to a difference of @xmath193 dex in the calibration of the @xmath3@xmath2 correlation .",
    "the lower inferred value for the temperature brings the measurement of rsp12 into excellent agreement with the @xcite constraint on the igm temperature at the same redshift , but inferred at somewhat higher gas density using the curvature distribution of the transmitted flux .",
    "more generally , recent igm temperature measurements appear to now show reasonable agreement and to favour the lower end of the range of previously discussed values , suggesting that the heat injection into the igm during reionisation was moderate .",
    "however , the high value of @xmath29 which now appears to have been measured with reasonable accuracy from the @xmath4@xmath3 distribution at @xmath167 disagrees with that inferred from the transmitted flux pdf at @xmath194 ( at 23@xmath17 for @xmath182 ) even if assuming ( i ) previously reported uncertainties on the pdf have been underestimated by a factor of two _ and _ ( ii ) a plausible estimate for the continuum placement uncertainty ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "while it is possible this difference is due to systematic uncertainties which remain underestimated , it is important to emphasise that the @xmath4@xmath3 distribution and pdf are sensitive to the temperature of the igm in nearly disjunct density ranges , with the pdf largely probing densities below the mean .",
    "while it appears very likely the igm @xmath1@xmath2 relation is not inverted during reionisation from both an observational and theoretical perspective ( e.g. @xcite ) , it may be too early to completely discard the interesting possibility that our understanding of the heating of the highly underdense igm is still incomplete .",
    "the convergence towards a self - consistent set of parameters describing the @xmath1@xmath2 relation at @xmath195 represents an encouraging step towards establishing the detailed thermal history of the high - redshift igm .",
    "the extension of the measurements based on the @xmath4@xmath3 distribution to a wider redshift range , and the development of methods that can push the temperature measurements to lower density and search for the predicted scatter or even bimodality in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane during reionisation ( e.g. @xcite ) will hopefully lead to a fuller characterisation of the thermal state of the igm and its evolution , and thus more generally to the properties of ionising sources in the early universe .",
