    "during the last decades revenues from indirect tax have become increasingly important in many economies .",
    "substantial attention has been devoted to evasion of indirect taxes .",
    "it is well known that indirect tax evasion , especially evasion of vat , may erode a substantial part of tax revenues [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .    in [ 3 ]",
    "a model with tax evasion is presented .",
    "the authors consider n firms which enter the market with a homogenous good .",
    "these firms have to pay an ad valorem sales tax , but may evade a certain amount of their tax duty .",
    "the aims of the firms are to maximize their profits .",
    "the equilibrium point is determined and an economic analysis is made .",
    "based on [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] , in our paper we present three economic models with tax evasion : the static model of cournot duopoly with tax evasion in section 2 , the dynamic model of cournot duopoly with tax evasion in section 3 and the dynamic model with tax evasion and time delay in section 4 .    in section 2 , in the static model the purpose of the firms",
    "is to maximize their profits .",
    "we determine the firms outputs and the declared revenues which maximize the profits , as well as the conditions for the model s parameters in which the maxim profits are obtained . using maple 11 ,",
    "the variables orbits are displayed .    in section 3",
    ", the dynamic model describes the variation in time of the firms outputs and the declared revenues .",
    "we study the local stability for the stationary state and the conditions under which it is asymptotically stable .    in section 4",
    ", we formulate a new dynamic model , based on the model from section 3 , in which the time delay is introduced .",
    "that means , the two firms do not enter the market at the same time .",
    "one of them is the leader firm and the other is the follower firm .",
    "the second one knows the leader s output in the previous moment @xmath0 @xmath1    using classical methods [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] we investigate the local stability of the stationary state by analyzing the corresponding transcendental characteristic equation of the linearized system . by choosing the delay as a bifurcation parameter",
    "we show that this model exhibits a limit cycle .",
    "finally numerical simulations , some conclusions and future research possibilities are offered .",
    "the static model of cournot duopoly is described by an economic game , where two firms enter the market with a homogenous consumption product .",
