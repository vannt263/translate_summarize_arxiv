    "star clusters are ideal sites to test the theories of stellar evolution , mass loss and pulsation .",
    "they contain a rather homogeneous sample of stars with well constrained parameters such as mass , metallicity , age , distance and luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the star clusters associated with the magellanic clouds span a wide range of age , which enables us to study the evolution of stars with various masses . owing to the relatively large numbers of stars in many of the star clusters in the magellanic clouds they are suitable for studying the short - lived later stages of stellar evolution . in this paper",
    "we target two intermediate age clusters , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cluster ngc1978 and the small magellanic cluster ( smc ) cluster ngc419 .",
    "these two clusters are the only ones in the magellanic clouds which are known to have agb stars with extremely high mass loss rates .",
    "each cluster has one star that was first detected by the isocam survey as a mid - ir source ( tanab et al .",
    "1998 ) as well as one slightly less extreme star found first in the near - ir ( tanab et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the clusters also have many other less extreme , but pulsating , agb stars .",
    "our aim here is to use the pulsation properties of the agb stars in these clusters to derive accurate mass estimates for the cluster agb stars and to thereby study mass loss along the agb .",
    "this mass loss along the agb can then be compared with that expected from mass loss laws commonly used in stellar evolution calculations .",
    "the cluster ngc1978 is a massive ( @xmath0@xmath1 , westerlund 1997 ) and luminous red globular cluster in the lmc .",
    "it has a rather high ellipticity ( @xmath2 , fischer et al .",
    "1992 ; mucciarelli et al .",
    "2007 ) suggesting it may be the result of the merger of two clusters .",
    "the cluster is found to contain oxygen - rich ( m - type ) stars with c / o @xmath3 1 in the stellar atmosphere and carbon - rich ( c - type ) stars with c / o @xmath4 1 ( e.g. frogel et al .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2006 ) derived a cluster metal abundance [ fe / h ] = -0.38 dex and noted that there was no evidence for a significant dispersion in abundance between stars ( @xmath5 dex ) .",
    "olszewski et al . (",
    "1991 ) derived [ fe / h ] = -0.42@xmath60.04 dex .",
    "however , hill et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived a significantly lower abundance ( [ fe / h ] = -0.96@xmath60.15 ) dex .",
    "this value has not been reproduced by any other group ( we will assume [ fe / h ] = -0.4 , corresponding to z @xmath7 0.008 , in our pulsation models ) .",
    "in a recent work , mucciarelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations , along with a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.50 and reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.09 , to determine the age of this cluster to be @xmath8 gyr when using isochrones from pisa evolutionary library ( castellani et al .",
    "2003 ) with @xmath9 , consistent with the determinations of the cluster metallicity .",
    "bomans , vallenari & de boer ( 1995 ) derived an age of 2.2 gyr for ngc1978 , and found no evidence for age variation within the cluster ( they assumed a distance modulus of 18.50 , e(b - v ) = 0.08 and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -0.4 ) .",
    "the homogeneous nature of the isochrone of ngc1978 is confirmed by the hst study of milone et al .",
    "the age determined for ngc1978 ( 1.9 to 2.2 gyr ) corresponds to an initial mass for stars at the beginning of the thermally pulsing agb ( tpagb ) of 1.54 to 1.62  according to the isochrones of girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with metallicity @xmath9 .",
    "these isochrones were derived from stellar evolution models that included a scaled reimers mass loss law .",
    "the mass estimated at the beginning of the tpagb for stars of age 1.9 to 2.2 gyr is 1.44 to 1.53 .",
    "the cluster ngc419 is one of the brightest intermediate age globular clusters in the smc .",
    "recent deep hr - diagrams obtained with the hst show that ngc419 has a broad main - sequence turnoff which is interpreted as the result of multiple star formation events or extended star formation ( glatt et al . 2008 ; girardi et al . 2009 ; rubele et al .",
    "the metallicity of ngc419 was determined from calcium triplet of observations by kayser et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to be close to [ fe / h ] = -0.7 , corresponding to a metallicity of @xmath10 .",
    "fits to the hr - diagrams yield ages of 1.21.6 gyr ( glatt et al .",
    "2008 ) , 1.31.5 gyr ( girardi et al . 2009 ) or 1.21.8 gyr ( rubele et al . 2009 ) .",
    "if we adopt ages of 1.4@xmath60.2 gyr , then the isochrones of girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with a metallicity of @xmath11 yield an initial mass for stars at the beginning of the tpagb of 1.82@xmath60.15  and a current mass ( as a result of mass loss via a scaled reimers law ) of 1.79@xmath60.15 .",
    "the two red giant clumps observed in ngc419 were shown by girardi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to be the result of the mass range of red giant stars in the cluster spanning the critical mass ( @xmath71.9 ) which separates those stars that do , or do not , develop electron - degenerate cores on entering the red giant branch .",
    "the distance moduli derived by glatt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and rubele et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are 18.83 and 18.84 , respectively , and both estimated the reddening as e(b - v ) = 0.11 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the near - ir and mid - ir sources in the two clusters are very red and clearly have large mass loss rates .",
    "this is confirmed by the mass loss rates derived for these stars by groenewegen et al .",
    "they should therefore have lost considerable amounts of mass during their agb evolution . by determining their current masses using pulsation models",
    ", we can estimate how much mass has been lost , and we can compare this to what we expect would have been lost according to commonly - used mass loss formulae such as those of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) and blcker ( 1995 ) . since these stars are large amplitude pulsators , we need to model them with nonlinear pulsation models because the linear and nonlinear pulsation periods for agb stars can be very different ( e.g. lebzelter & wood 2005 ) .",
    "we now discuss the nonlinear pulsation models in each of the clusters .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : mbolp_n1978 ] , the sources ir1 and mir1 in ngc1978 are neither the most luminous nor the longest - period agb stars in this cluster even though they are the reddest by a long margin ( see figure  [ fig : mkjmk ] ) .",
    "this is a strange situation as the reddest stars with the largest mass loss rates should be the most luminous and the most evolved stars in the cluster .",
    "the most luminous star in ngc1978 is le3 but it is not particularly red .",
    "one possibility is that this object is a superposition on the sky of two bright agb stars but we can find no evidence for this : the star appears single in an archive hst image of the cluster and lederer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) did not notice any multiple velocity components in their high resolution infrared spectra .",
    "we therefore assume that le3 is indeed a single star .",
    "there are , however , several pieces of evidence that le3 is not a normal cluster member : ( 1 ) it appears anomalously bright in the @xmath12,(@xmath13-@xmath14)@xmath15 diagram ( figure  [ fig : mkjmk ] ) compared to the locus formed by the other stars in both ngc1978 and ngc419 , ( 2 ) it is more luminous than any star in ngc419 even though the low luminosity agb stars in ngc419 have masses of 1.87m@xmath16 compared to the smaller value of 1.55m@xmath16 in ngc1978 , and ( 3 ) the period of le3 lies midway between the fundamental and first overtone relations in figure  [ fig : mbolp_n1978 ] , suggesting that its mass is not normal for the cluster .",
    "we suggest that le3 is a field star with a higher mass than that of the agb stars in ngc1978 or that it is an evolved blue straggler belonging to the cluster ( and hence of higher mass than the other agb stars ) .",
    "if we ignore le3 , the most luminous cluster star becomes le1 with @xmath17 , still slightly more luminous than ir1 and significantly more luminous that mir1 . in order to explain the luminosity and period of mir1 relative to le1",
    ", we have to assume that mir1 has recently undergone a helium shell flash and that it is currently in the post - flash luminosity dip ( 0.43 magnitudes below the interflash luminosity maximum ) .",
    "* we note that agb stars spend about a third of their time during the interpulse period 0.43 magnitudes or more below the maximum h - burning luminosity ( see the light curves in vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) , so our assumption is reasonable .",
    "* ir1 would be slightly ( 0.16 magnitudes ) below the interflash luminosity maximum . in that case",
    ", the core masses for ir1 and mir1 would be given by the luminosity - core mass relation for a star with the luminosity of le1 at the tip of the agb .",
    "hence , for our nonlinear pulsation models we assume the luminosity of le1 when we derive the core masses from the luminosity - core mass relation .",
    "we note that stars thought to be in a post - flash luminosity dip have also been found in the intermediate age lmc cluster ngc1846 ( lebzelter & wood 2007 ) .    as with the linear models ,",
    "a major uncertainity is the c / o ratio used in the opacity tables .",
    "we assume c / o = 1.5 for ir1 and c / o = 2.0 for mir1 .",
    "for the mixing - length , we used the same value as in the linear models .",
    "given the luminosities for ir1 and mir1 in table 3 , a series of static models with different masses was created for each of them and these models were then allowed to reach a full - amplitude limit cycle in the nonlinear pulsation code . a turbulent viscosity parameter @xmath18",
    "( see keller & wood 2006 ) of 0.2 was used for ir1 and 0.1 was used for mir1 as these values gave limiting light curve amplitudes similar to the observed amplitude .",
    "we note that the large amplitude pulsators go through a readjustment of their interior structure while transitioning from a static model to a large amplitude pulsator and that the nonlinear pulsation period can be quite different from the linear period of the static model .",
    "the models for ir1 and mir1 had linear periods of 427 and 333 days and nonlinear periods of 459 and 375 days , respectively .",
    "it was found that masses of 1.43m@xmath16 and 1.32m@xmath16 reproduced the observed periods ( 458 and 376 days ) of ir1 and mir1 , respectively .",
    "the light curves and radius variations of the two models are shown in figures  [ fig : ngc1978_ir1_model ] and [ fig : ngc1978_mir1_model ] .",
    "given that the mass of stars low on the agb of ngc1978 is close to 1.55m@xmath16 , it appears that ir1 has lost @xmath00.12m@xmath16 on the agb while mir1 has lost @xmath00.23m@xmath16 .    in order to compare the observed mass loss on the agb on ngc1978 with the mass loss predicted by the commonly - used mass loss formulae of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 , hereinafter vw ) and blcker ( 1995 )",
    ", we have made simple synthetic agb evolutionary calculations including mass loss .",
    "averaged over helium shell flashes , agb stars evolve at a constant rate in @xmath19 per unit time ( e.g. wood & cahn 1977 ) and we use their rate @xmath20 this rate is multiplied by a factor ( 1-@xmath21 ) in the presence of third dredge - up , where @xmath21 is the fraction of the mass burnt through during the previous shell flash cycle that is dredged up .",
    "we used @xmath22 as found for lmc stars by marigo et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in order to calculate the mass loss rate",
    "according to vw , we need the fundamental mode pulsation period . here",
    ", we use the fundamental mode @xmath19,@xmath23 relation shown in figure  [ fig : mbolp_n1978 ] to obtain @xmath24 : the relation is @xmath25 in order to use the blcker ( 1995 ) formula , we need the radius .",
    "this was obtained from the fit @xmath26 to the agb position in the theoretical hr - diagram as defined by the @xmath19 and @xmath27 values in table 3 .",
    "we assumed that each agb star currently in the cluster arrived at @xmath28 with mass 1.55m@xmath16 .",
    "the star was then evolved in time using the above equations until the envelope was dissipated .",
    "it was immediately obvious that the blcker ( 1995 ) formula terminates the agb at far too low a luminosity , @xmath29 .",
    "this is less than the luminosity of nearly all the variable agb stars in ngc1978 .",
    "on the other hand , the vw mass loss rate caused the agb to terminate at @xmath30 , in very good agreement with the luminosity of the most luminous star le1 at @xmath31 .",
    "in the evolutionary models , the agb mass reduced to the values appropriate for ir1 and mir1 at @xmath32 and -5.03 , respectively .",
    "this shows that mass loss is very concentrated near the tip of the agb .",
    "thus , each of the stars le1 , ir1 and mir1 is close to the end of its agb lifetime which should end within the next 2@xmath3310@xmath34 years according to the evolutionary model .",
    "the ir1 and mir1 sources in ngc419 occur at the red , high luminosity tip of the agb as expected ( see figures  [ fig : mbolp_n419 ] and [ fig : mkjmk ] ) .",
    "nonlinear pulsation models were created for these two stars using the same procedures as for ngc1978 . here , the core mass was calculated from the luminosity - core mass relation using the luminosity of the object itself ( from table 4 ) . as with ngc1978 , we assume c / o = 1.5 for ir1 and c / o = 2.0 for mir1 .    the light curves and radius variations of the two nonlinear pulsation models are shown in figures  [ fig : ngc419_ir1_model ] and [ fig : ngc419_mir1_model ] .",
    "the observed periods of ir1 and mir1 in ngc419 are 488 and 738 days , respectively .",
    "the periods of the nonlinear pulsation models are 487 and 731 days , respectively ( the corresponding linear periods of the static parent models were 509 and 1150 days ) .",
    "masses of 1.70m@xmath16 and 1.40m@xmath16 were required to reproduced the observed periods of ir1 and mir1 . given that the mass of stars low on the agb of ngc419 is close to 1.87m@xmath16",
    ", it appears that ir1 has lost @xmath00.17m@xmath16 on the agb while mir1 has lost @xmath00.47m@xmath16 on the agb .    as with ngc1978",
    ", we have made simple synthetic agb calculations including mass loss according to the formulae in vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) and blcker ( 1995 ) .",
    "the methods used were the same as in ngc1978 except that we used @xmath35 ( the smc value found by marigo et al .",
    "1999 ) and the @xmath19,@xmath23 relation we used was a fit to the observed fundamental mode relation given by @xmath36 in ngc419 , as in ngc1978 , the blcker ( 1995 ) formula terminates the agb at far too low a luminosity , @xmath37 , less than the luminosity of nearly all the variable agb stars .",
    "the vw mass loss rate caused the agb to terminate at @xmath38 .",
    "this is more luminous than all stars in the cluster except mir1 which has @xmath39 .",
    "this suggests that the vw mass loss rate is slightly too large for the stars in ngc419 .",
    "( however , we note that the mean luminosity of ngc419 mir1 may be more uncertain than that of most stars since the luminosity estimated from the near - ir and sst observations needed a particularly large increase of 0.72 magnitudes in order to get to the mean value - see section  [ sec : bml ] ) .",
    "the effect of the slightly low agb termination luminosity on the initial - final mass relation is very small since the change in core mass between @xmath38 and -5.33 is only 0.028m@xmath16 .",
    "more significant is the effect on nucleosynthetic yields . the average time taken to increase @xmath19 from -5.14 to -5.33 on",
    "the agb is @xmath06.6@xmath3310@xmath34 years ( if @xmath40 ) , which corresponds to @xmath010 shell flashes and associated third dredge - ups .",
    "the yields of carbon and s - process elements returned to the interstellar medium will thus be underestimated when using the vw mass loss rate .",
    "full agb evolution calculations are required to properly quantify these effects .",
    "pulsation periods have been determined for most of the bright agb stars in the lmc cluster ngc1978 and the smc cluster ngc419 .",
    "it is shown that the agb stars start pulsating at low luminosities on the agb in the second overtone mode of radial pulsation .",
    "they switch to lower order modes at higher luminosities and the carbon stars are first overtone or fundamental mode pulsators .",
    "pulsation masses have been determined for the o - rich pulsators low on the agb . in ngc1978 ,",
    "the early - agb mass is 1.55m@xmath16 while it is 1.87m@xmath16 in ngc419 .",
    "these masses are in very good agreement with the masses predicted by isochones which are consistent with the ages of the clusters determined from main - sequence fitting .",
    "reasons are given that the brightest star in ngc1978 , le3 , is not a cluster member , or perhaps it is an evolved blue straggler .",
    "neither of the two very dusty agb stars in ngc1978 , ir1 and mir1 , is the brightest star on the agb .",
    "it is suggested that mir1 is in post - helium shell flash luminosity dip and that it is about 0.43 magnitudes below the interflash hydrogen - burning luminosity peak .",
    "ir1 is about 0.16 magnitudes below the interflash peak . in ngc419 ,",
    "the two very dusty agb stars , ir1 and mir1 , are the most luminous stars in the cluster .",
    "pulsation masses have been derived for the dusty stars in each cluster from nonlinear pulsation models .",
    "the pulsation masses show that these stars have lost a few tenth of a solar mass due to stellar winds near the agb tip .",
    "the agb tip luminosities are compared to simple synthetic agb evolutionary models which include mass loss .",
    "these models use the derived stellar mass on the early agb as their starting point .",
    "the evolutionary models which use the vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) mass loss rate reproduce the observed tip luminosities quite well while models using the blcker ( 1995 ) mass loss rate predict agb tip luminosities that are far too faint .",
    "the evolutionary models just described are very approximate .",
    "full evolutionary models which include helium shell flashes are required to properly model the final evolution on the agb .",
    "the study here shows that reliable pulsation masses can be determined for agb stars .",
    "given the considerable number of intermediate age clusters in the lmc and smc this leads to the possibility of determining the amount of mass lost in clusters covering a range of agb tip luminosity , stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "comparing these results with evolutionary models should allow a determination of the mass loss rate as a function of mass , luminosity and metallicity .",

    "<S> the intermediate - age magellanic cloud clusters ngc1978 and ngc419 are each found to contain substantial numbers of pulsating agb stars , both oxygen - rich and carbon - rich . </S>",
    "<S> each cluster also contains two pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars which are infrared sources with a large mass loss rate . </S>",
    "<S> pulsation masses have been derived for the agb variables , from the lowest luminosity o - rich variables to the most evolved infrared sources . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the stars in ngc1978 have a mass of 1.55  early on the agb while the ngc419 stars have a mass of 1.87  early on the agb . </S>",
    "<S> these masses are in good agreement with those expected from the cluster ages determined by main - sequence turnoff fitting . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear pulsation models fitted to the highly evolved agb stars show that a substantial amount of mass loss has occurred during the agb evolution of these stars . </S>",
    "<S> an examination of the observed mass loss on the agb , and the agb tip luminosities , shows that in both clusters the mass loss rates computed from the formula of vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) reproduce the observations reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> the mass loss rates computed from the formula of blcker ( 1995 ) terminate the agb in both clusters at a luminosity which is much too low .    </S>",
