    "<S> neutron spin - flip scattering observations of a resonance in the superconducting state is often taken as evidence of an unconventional superconducting state in which the gap changes sign @xmath0 for momentum transfers @xmath1 which play an important role in the pairing . </S>",
    "<S> recently questions regarding this identification for the fe - pnictide superconductors have been raised and it has been suggested that @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose that inelastic neutron or x - ray scattering measurements of the spectral weight of a phonon of momentum @xmath1 can distinguish between these two pairing scenarios .    </S>",
    "<S> determining the superconducting gap structure in the fe - based superconductors has proven difficult due to the complicated multisheeted , multiorbital nature of the fermi surface , as well as problems with fabricating clean films and interfaces . at present the most popular candidate for pairing in most of these materials is the @xmath3 state which changes sign between hole and electron pockets and arises naturally from a spin - fluctuation interaction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are few phase - sensitive tests of the relative sign change of @xmath4 between the different fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> josephson tunneling experiments @xcite , fourier transform stm in a magnetic field @xcite , and the observation of a resonance mode in inelastic neutron scattering experiments@xcite have been offered as limited evidence for such a sign change .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , an electron - phonon interaction enhanced by orbital fluctuations has been proposed as the mechanism which is responsible for pairing in the fe - based superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction leads to a so - called @xmath5 gap which is positive on both the hole and electron fermi surfaces . while in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , the gap can be anisotropic and accidental nodes can even occur , the relative sign of the gap on regions of the hole and electron fermi surfaces which have the same dominant orbital weight will be negative if the pairing is driven by spin - fluctuations and positive if driven by phonon - orbital - fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is important to determine the relative sign between @xmath6 and @xmath7 on the hole and electron fermi surfaces , respectively , for momentum transfers @xmath1 which connect such regions .    </S>",
    "<S> one test of this is the occurrence of a spin resonance peak in the neutron spin - flip scattering in the superconducting state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bcs coherence factor which enters the spin - flip scattering is @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the quasi - particle energy and near threshold , where @xmath10 goes to zero , this coherence factor goes to 1 if @xmath7 and @xmath6 have opposite signs and zero if they have the same sign . </S>",
    "<S> a resonance peak is expected in the former case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , arguments @xcite have been given that for the case of bafe@xmath11co@xmath12as@xmath13 the experimentally observed peak @xcite may be consistent with an @xmath5 gap , if the scattering rate collapses sufficiently rapidly in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> thus one would like to find additional experimental probes which provide a way of determining the relative sign of the gap between the hole and electron pockets .    </S>",
    "<S> as is known , there exist anomalies in the phonon spectral weight of conventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> various authors @xcite have shown that if the phonon frequency @xmath14 is greater than twice the gap @xmath15 , but not too far above , significant spectral weight is transferred below @xmath16 into a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the phonon peak shifts to higher frequencies and broadens . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have been convincingly observed in neutron scattering experiments on the borocarbide superconductor yni@xmath13b@xmath13c @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior reflects the fact that in the superconducting state , the coherence factor that enters the coupling of a phonon to electron polarization fluctuations is similar to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) except that it has a plus sign . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the coherence factor will go to 1 at threshold if @xmath7 and @xmath6 have the same sign . </S>",
    "<S> this will lead to an anomalous resonance and hardening of the phonon peak for an @xmath5 gap . here </S>",
    "<S> we point out that for an @xmath3 gap with @xmath17 , the anomalous resonance is absent and the phonon peak shifts down ( softens ) slightly . </S>",
    "<S> thus neutron and x - ray scattering @xcite measurements of the phonon spectral weight at specific @xmath1 values can provide information on the relative sign of the gap @xcite .    to explore the use of this effect to determine the relative gap signs in the fe - based materials </S>",
    "<S> , we will use the same 5-orbital tight binding fit of the lda bandstructure that we previously used to discuss the possible occurrence of a neutron scattering spin resonance @xcite . in this case , with an electron doping @xmath18 one finds the fermi surfaces and orbital occupations illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> here there are two hole fermi surfaces @xmath19 and @xmath20 around the @xmath21 point and two electron fermi surfaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 around the @xmath24 and @xmath25 points of the unfolded ( 1fe / cell ) brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> we will use an orbital notation @xmath26 to denote the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 orbits , respectively , where the axes are along the fe - fe bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant orbital weight of the bloch states on the fermi surfaces is indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ] , green=@xmath28 , blue=@xmath29 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 connects @xmath27 parts of the hole @xmath20 and @xmath28 parts of the electron @xmath22 fermi surfaces and @xmath33 connects @xmath27 parts of @xmath19 to the @xmath29 parts of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    as kontani and onari @xcite have noted , local fe - ion displacements couple to orbital fluctuations . the polarization susceptibility associated with these orbital fluctuations enters the phonon self - energy and is reflected in the phonon spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine the change in the phonon spectral weight @xmath34 associated with the @xmath35 and @xmath36 momenta shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] when the system goes from a normal state to a superconducting state with a nominal @xmath5 gap or an @xmath3 gap . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with @xmath32 and will assume that there is an electron - phonon coupling @xmath37 for scattering an electron between the dominantly @xmath27-like states on the @xmath20 hole fermi surface to the @xmath28-like states on the @xmath22 electron fermi surfaces . in the following , the real part of the normal state phonon self - energy will be absorbed to give the dressed normal state phonon frequency @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> then at low energies , the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy for momentum @xmath32 dominantly comes from scattering between the nearly nested @xmath27-like states on @xmath20 and the @xmath28-like states on @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the change between the superconducting and normal state phonon self - energy is also determined by the @xmath27@xmath28 orbital fluctuations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the important orbital contribution to the phonon self - energy is @xmath39 with @xmath40^{-1}\\right\\}_{1212 } \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath41 . here </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction matrix is @xmath42 and @xmath43 the notation follows ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the intra- and inter - orbital coulomb interactions , @xmath46 the exchange coupling and @xmath47 the pair hopping interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider a typically rotationally invariant set of interaction parameters which are similar to those previously used to study the occurrence of a spin resonance in the @xmath3 superconducting state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are such that @xmath48 in units of the hopping @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 @xcite . in the superconducting state the normal and anomalous gorkov green s functions are given as @xmath53 with @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> for the normal state calculations , the gap is set to zero in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) .    here , because we are calculating the orbital - fluctuations , the sign between the normal and anomalous green s function products in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) is negative </S>",
    "<S> . it would be positive if we were studying the spin susceptibility and in addition the orbital interaction matrix @xmath55 would be changed to @xmath56 . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) we use a notation in which @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the calculations were carried out for a low temperature @xmath59 in units of @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   versus @xmath61 for the normal state ( red , solid ) , the @xmath5 superconducting state with @xmath62 ( blue , dashed ) and the @xmath3 state with @xmath63 ( green , dot - dashed ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the imaginary part of @xmath64 versus @xmath61 with @xmath65 for the normal state ( solid ) , the superconducting states with an @xmath66 gap ( dashed ) and an @xmath67 gap ( dash - dot ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the orbital response is similar to what was found for the spin susceptibility with the @xmath3 and @xmath5 gaps interchanged . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the phonon - orbital - fluctuations provide the dominant pairing interaction in the fe - based superconductors then the gap will have @xmath5 character and one will find an anomalous resonance in the orbital susceptibility in the superconducting state rather than in the spin susceptibility .    although it would be interesting to have a direct scattering probe of the orbital susceptibility spectral weight shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , one can still access its structure by measuring the phonon spectral weight . using the orbital susceptibility , we can evaluate the phonon self - energies that enter the normal and superconducting phonon progagators @xcite , @xmath68 and @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the superconducting and normal phonon self - energies obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) , with the gap set to zero in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:5 ] ) for the normal case and set to @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the @xmath5 and @xmath3 superconducting states , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   versus @xmath61 for the normal state ( red , solid ) , the @xmath5 ( blue , dashed ) and @xmath3 ( green , dot - dashed ) superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the real part @xmath75 ( see text ) for the @xmath5 ( red , solid ) and @xmath3 ( blue , dashed ) superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the phonon damping @xmath76 versus @xmath77 is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]a . </S>",
    "<S> here we have taken @xmath78 and set @xmath79 . as @xmath38 approaches @xmath80 , </S>",
    "<S> the effects we are discussing are enhanced and diminish when @xmath81 becomes large compared with @xmath80 . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]a , for an @xmath5 gap there is an enhanced phonon damping above @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the increase in the density of states in this region due to the opening of the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement also depends upon the coherence factor and as seen for the @xmath3 case , if the coherence factor vanishes , the onset of the damping rises slowly as @xmath61 exceeds @xmath80 and is smaller than in the normal state .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]b , we have plotted the difference between the real part of the phonon self - energy in the superconducting and the normal states asociated with the @xmath82@xmath83 scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 case shows the familiar hardening of the phonon that occurs when @xmath38 exceeds @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in the @xmath5 superconducting state , @xmath84 is positive for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see when we look at the phonon spectral weight , the negative dip for @xmath86 leads to what allen et al.@xcite have called a  vibrational / superelectronic \" resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of @xmath84 is quite difference in the @xmath3 state . here for @xmath85 , @xmath87 is negative and this leads to a softening of the @xmath38 phonon . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there will not be a resonance feature below @xmath80 in the phonon spectral weight .    using the results for the self - energy shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] , we have plotted the phonon spectral weight @xmath88 versus @xmath77 in fig .  [ fig:4]a . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line shows the result for the normal state while the long dashed and the dash - dot curves are for the superconducting @xmath5 and @xmath3 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here one sees that for an @xmath5 gap there is the expected resonance just below @xmath80 and the phonon peak has shifted up in frequency and broadened . for the @xmath3 gap , </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous resonance below @xmath80 is absent and the phonon peak has slightly softened as well as narrowed . </S>",
    "<S> similar results for the @xmath33 phonon spectral weight are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4]b .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htbp ]   versus @xmath77 for wavevectors ( a ) @xmath32 and ( b ) @xmath33 for the normal state ( red , solid ) , the @xmath5 ( blue , dashed ) and @xmath3 ( green , dot - dashed ) superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> note that we have added a finite damping in the calculation of the orbital susceptibility @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4],title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    in rpa calculations @xcite there were parameter ranges in which the @xmath3-like gap was found to have nodes on the @xmath90 fermi surfaces . in this case , the nominally @xmath3 gap will have the same sign on the parts of the fermi surfaces connected by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> however , they would differ for @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it will be important to measure the phonon spectral weight for various near nesting @xmath1 values . </S>",
    "<S> however , one will need phonon modes that couple to the relevant orbital scattering and in addition have frequencies @xmath81 of order the sum of the magnitudes of the superconducting gaps @xmath91 associated with the nearby nested regions . in principle , with sufficient @xmath92 and @xmath61 resolution and sensitivity , neutron and x - ray scattering offer the possibility of mapping out the relative structure of the gap between various parts of the fermi surfaces in fe - based as well as other unconventional superconductors . </S>"
