    "it is the usual practice in global pdf fits to place kinematic constraints on the dis data sets , typically @xmath11 gev@xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath12 , so that only leading twist massless qcd contributions need be considered , thereby reducing the model dependent error on the extracted pdfs . as a byproduct of this procedure the pdfs are directly constrained by data only in the region @xmath14 .",
    "however , plentiful dis data exist outside this region . in order to utilize them in global fits",
    ", one needs minimally to include target mass corrections ( tmcs ) , which scale as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the nucleon mass , and higher - twist corrections , which scale as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 a hadronic scale describing non perturbative parton - parton correlations inside the nucleon .",
    "several methods are available in the literature to perform tmcs , and have been reviewed by f.  steffens @xcite .",
    "one is the well - known georgi - politzer formalism based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) , whose results are also reproduced in the covariant parton model . however , this formalism suffers from the problem that it leads to non - zero values of the structure function on a nucleon target in the unphysical region @xmath19 .",
    "another prescription is a simple rescaling of the structure function , obtained by substituting @xmath0 with the nachtmann variable @xmath20 .",
    "this also shares the above `` unphysical region '' problem .",
    "lastly , working in collinear factorization ( cf ) the kinematic boundaries are naturally respected .",
    "one advantage of the cf formalism versus the ope formalism is that the former can be also applied to semi - inclusive dis @xcite , and indeed to any hard - scattering process .",
    "an application to parity - violating dis was discussed by t.  hobbs @xcite .",
    "however , tmcs do not exhaust all possible @xmath21 power corrections .",
    "these include dynamical higher - twist corrections ( parton correlations ) as well as all uncontrolled leading - twist power corrections , such as jet mass corrections @xcite .",
    "they also include higher - order perturbative terms , which are logarithmic in @xmath1 but resemble a power law at low scales , and large-@xmath0 resummation effects @xcite . despite their disparate origin , it is customary to label these `` residual '' corrections as `` higher - twist '' , as i will do here . in the cteq6x",
    "fits , these ht corrections are parameterized phenomenologically using a multiplicative factor modifying the structure function of the proton and the neutron : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the structure function after the target mass corrections have been made . the function @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 .",
    "after inclusion of tmcs , this parameterization is sufficiently flexible to give a good description of the data . to simplify the global fits , the ht corrections for protons and neutrons where taken equal , given that their difference was found to be relatively small in other studies .",
    "in order to separate the @xmath26 and @xmath27 quark at large @xmath28 it is necessary to consider dis data on deuteron targets , which are sensitive to a different linear combination of @xmath27 and @xmath26 quarks than the corresponding data on proton targets .",
    "however , at large @xmath0 the deuteron deviates from a simple sum of a free proton and neutron due to significant effects of nuclear binding , fermi motion and nucleon off - shellness @xcite .",
    "dependence of the deuteron correction factor @xmath29 calculated with cteq6x pdfs , tmcs in the cf prescription , the fitted ht corrections , and the paris deuteron wave function . ]    since the deuteron is weakly bound one can approximate the bound nucleon structure function by its on - shell value , and write the deuteron ( @xmath26 ) structure function as @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the nucleon ( proton @xmath32 or neutron @xmath33 ) structure function including tmc and ht corrections . the `` smearing function '' @xmath34 is computed from the deuteron wave function and implements nuclear binding and fermi motion corrections ; at @xmath35 it can be interpreted as the light - cone momentum distribution of nucleons in the deuteron .",
    "the variable @xmath36 is the deuteron s momentum fraction carried by the struck nucleon , where @xmath37 is the virtual photon four - momentum , @xmath38 the nucleon ( deuteron ) four - momentum , and @xmath39 the deuteron mass ; it differs from the light - cone fractional momentum by terms of @xmath40 .",
    "off - shell corrections to @xmath31 can also be implemented in under a few assumptions , which are outside the scope of this talk .",
    "the deuteron correction factor @xmath41 computed with the paris wave function and the cteq6x pdfs is plotted in figure  [ fig : dpn ] .",
    "it shows a remarkable @xmath1 dependence at @xmath42 gev .",
    "part of this @xmath1 dependence comes from the smearing function @xmath43 , which depends on the target mass through the variable @xmath44 .",
    "however , this induces only minor effects on the deuteron correction factor .",
    "most of the @xmath1 dependence shown in the figure is due to tmc and ht corrections at the nucleon level .",
    "it is also clear that nuclear smearing corrections do not disappear at large @xmath1 : in general , they are not a subleading effect , and can not be avoided by kinematics cuts such as those commonly used in global pdf fits .",
    "the cteq6x global pdf fits @xcite were performed at nlo to a wide variety of data similar to that used in the determination of the cteq6m1 pdfs except that no neutrino data were used since their use would involve additional nuclear corrections beyond those for deuterium .",

    "the e866 data favor at large @xmath0 a slightly reduced @xmath27 pdf and an increased @xmath26 pdf ; however in the latter case the @xmath47 asymmetry and @xmath50+jet data compensate the increase leaving the @xmath26 pdf nearly unchanged .",
    "subsequently , several prescriptions for tmc , ht and nuclear corrections were considered , and the dis kinematic cuts progressively relaxed to @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev , in order to avoid most of the resonance region but be able to include a good number of jefferson lab data .",
    "this cut is labeled ` cut3 ` , with intermediate cuts labeled ` cut1 ` and ` cut2 ` .",
    "as tmcs , the discussed ope , @xmath53-scaling and cf prescriptions were considered . nuclear smearing was performed using the paris wave function with on - shell nucleon structure functions or off - shell corrections from the mst model @xcite ; the results were compared to fits obtained using either no nuclear corrections apart from isospin effects , or nuclear corrections in the density model , which extrapolates the nuclear effects observed in heavier nuclei to the deuteron .",
    "the main results of the cteq6x analysis can be summarized as follows .    * * standard kinematic cuts . * when using the standard dis kinematic cuts , @xmath54 gev and @xmath49 gev , the pdfs are insensitive to tmc and ht corrections ; however nuclear corrections are large and start at @xmath55 , in a region well inside what is included in the cuts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cut0-cut3 ] , left ) . * * enlarged kinematic cuts . *",
    "the pdfs are relatively stable against variations of the dis cuts in the vicinity of the @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 cut ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cut0-cut3 ] , right plot , left panel ) . as a consequence of the enlarged data set ,",
    "there is a substantial reduction in the uncertainty of these pdfs due to the increased data , with the cut3 errors reduced by 1020% for @xmath56 , and by up to 4060% at larger @xmath0 .",

    "a detailed investigation of the systematic pdf uncertainties induced by nuclear corrections modeling is underway , as reviewed by j.  owens @xcite .",
    "one very important result is that , surprisingly , the large-@xmath0 _ gluon _ pdf is as sensitive to nuclear corrections as the @xmath26 pdf ; they are anticorrelated to each other due to an interplay of dis , dy and jet data .",
    "this has potentially profound implications for future collider experiments , since the resulting variation of the gluon is significant even at values of @xmath0 as low as 0.4 . as an illustration",

    "quark - hadron duality in structure functions refers to the experimental observation that inclusive structure functions in the region dominated by low - lying nucleon resonances follow deep inelastic structure functions describing high energy data , to which the resonance structure functions average @xcite .",
    "the new large-@xmath0 cteq6x pdfs can be used to verify to what degree this holds true , which is important to understand the transition from the perturbative ( partonic ) to the non perturbative ( hadronic ) regime of qcd .",
    "the handbag diagram used in the pqcd computations assumes no interaction between the scattered quark and the target remnant .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation only if their rapidity separation , @xmath69 , is large enough .",
    "a value of @xmath70 , known as `` berger criterion '' @xcite , should be sufficient to ensure applicability of pqcd .",
    "since @xmath69 decreases as @xmath71 or @xmath72 , this limits the range in @xmath0 and @xmath1 where the comparison of pqcd computations and resonance region data makes sense .    in figure",
    "[ fig : qhd ] the ratios of jefferson lab data averaged over different resonance regions to computations using cteq6x are plotted @xcite .",
    "these are compared to calculations using alekhin09 pdfs @xcite , which were fitted with similar tmc , ht and nuclear corrections as cteq6x .",
    "only data satisfying a conservative @xmath73 are retained .",
    "data in the @xmath74 gev@xmath12 region were included in the cteq6x fit , and indeed are well described .",
    "the @xmath75 gev@xmath12 region , while not directly included in the fit , is constrained by dis data at larger @xmath1 because of dglap evolution .",
    "data in the @xmath76 gev@xmath12 region lie in the extrapolation region of the cteq6x fits .",
    "the plot shows that quark - hadron duality works within 5 - 10% .",
    "this opens the possibility of using resonance region data to extend the range of validity in @xmath0 of the fits .",
    "a study is underway @xcite to further explore this issue , e.g. , by determining whether duality holds for smaller values of the @xmath69 cut , which would enlarge the number of data points , by evaluating nuclear systematic uncertainties and by quantifying pdf uncertainties from the ht parameters , especially in the extrapolation region .",
    "i have shown that a good control of global pdf fits can be achieved when including dis data in the pre - asymptotic region of large @xmath0 and small @xmath1 , if one considers tmc and ht corrections .",
    "the resulting pdfs are stable against available tmc prescriptions , with the modeling uncertainty absorbed in the phenomenologically extracted ht terms .",
    "this is very good for applications to collider and neutrino physics @xcite , and for comparing pdf moments to lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "theoretical nuclear corrections to deuteron target data are necessary for @xmath27 and @xmath26 quark separation at @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath26-quark and , surprisingly , the gluon pdf turn out to be very sensitive to uncertainties in the modeling and calculation of nuclear effects .",
    "furthermore , the induced uncertainty on parton luminosities at the lhc is non - negligible .",
    "a careful study shows that the induced systematic @xmath26-quark pdf uncertainty is of the same order as the experimental uncertainty if the deuteron target data are removed from the fit @xcite . therefore , further progress in constraining the @xmath26 quark and the gluon pdfs at large @xmath0 requires a better theoretical understanding of nuclear corrections , combined with new data on free proton , but sensitive to @xmath26 , such as from parity violating dis or from neutrino dis on a hydrogen target @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can use data minimizing nuclear corrections , such as from proton - tagged dis on deuteron targets , for which the nuclear uncertainty is smaller than 2% @xcite . using quark - hadron duality to include resonance region data in the fits , thereby extending their @xmath0 range , seems also feasible .",
    "finally , data sensitive to large @xmath0 gluons , such as from the longitudinal and charm structure functions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , are required to constrain the gluons independently of the jet data .",
