    "high energy heavy - ion collisions enable the study of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions . at sufficiently high collision energies quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "predicts that hot and dense deconfined matter , commonly referred to as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is formed .",
    "the experiment alice  @xcite at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , allows the study of the qcd matter in a new energy domain .",
    "high @xmath2 partons produced in the initial stage of the collisions , have been identified as a valuable probe of the medium .",
    "they are only observed indirectly , as a collimated jet of hadrons originating from the hadronization of the partonic shower .",
    "comparing the properties of the jet fragmentation in proton - proton and heavy - ion collisions will reveal the modifications induced by the medium on the hard scattered partons .",
    "ideally , one needs to know the 4-momentum of the parton when it has been produced in the hard scattering and after it has been modified by the medium .",
    "this can be achieved by selecting particular hard processes in which there is a photon in the final state . since the photon does not interact with the medium , its 4-momentum is not modified and thus provides a measure of the hard scattered parton emitted back - to - back with the photon . measuring the hadrons",
    "opposite to the photon is thus a promising way to measure the jet fragmentation and imbalance between photon and hadrons to quantify the modifications due to the medium .    to establish a reference measurement for heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "proton - proton collision data collected with alice in 2010 have been analyzed with the ultimate goal to construct the direct photon - charged hadron correlations .",
    "minimum bias data have been collected in pp collisions at center of mass @xmath3tev .",
    "the present results have been obtained by analyzing about 160 million events .",
    "the preliminary result is presented together with inclusive photon - charged hadrons correlation and @xmath0-charged hadrons spectra all showing the characteristic di - jet pattern from where the momentum imbalance @xmath1 is extracted .",
    "the experimental technique consists in tagging events with a leading trigger and measuring the distribution of hadrons associated to this leading trigger from the same event .",
    "such a measurement requires an excellent photon and @xmath0 identification and the measurement of charged and neutral hadrons with good @xmath4 resolution . in alice , the electromagnetic calorimeters , phos",
    "( @xmath5 and @xmath6 = 100@xmath7 ) and emcal ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 = 100@xmath7 )  @xcite , are capable to measure photons with high efficiency and resolution . in the calorimeters , electromagnetic particles",
    "are detected as clusters of cells in the calorimeters .",
    "roughly we have identified @xmath0 candidate as a pair of clusters with invariant mass around the @xmath0 mass between 110 and 160  mev / c@xmath10 , and single clusters are identified as inclusive photon candidates .",
    "no particle identification has been applied yet so that the single cluster sample may contain a sizable fraction of charged particles which develop a shower in the calorimeters or high-@xmath4 merged @xmath0 cluster which can not be reconstructed by invariant mass .",
    "the central tracking system ( its and tpc ) , covering the pseudo - rapidity @xmath11 and the full azimuth , is used for charged track measurements , contributes to the direct photon identification by applying the isolation technique .",
    "three different trigger particles have been selected for the correlation measurements : ( i ) the charged trigger is chosen as the track with highest transverse momentum among all the tracks from the same event , ( ii ) the photon cluster trigger is defined as the calorimeter cluster with highest energy and no charged track from the same event has momentum larger than photon cluster , ( iii ) the @xmath0 trigger is selected as the cluster pair within the appropriate invariant mass range and with the highest transverse momentum in the event .",
    "the azimuthal correlation between the trigger particles ( charged particle , single cluster ) and charged hadrons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clusterch ] . the near side ( @xmath12 ) and away side ( @xmath13 ) peaks",
    "are clearly observed .",
    "the correlation with cluster triggers shows larger di - jet peaks reflecting the fact that the neutral trigger selection enhances the probability that the trigger is the leading particle of the jet fragmentation compared to the less restrictive charged trigger selection .",
    "the azimuthal correlations from inclusive photon clusters and @xmath0 triggers show quite similar shapes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photonpi0 ] ) , indicating that most of the inclusive photon clusters are @xmath14 decay photons .",
    "azimuthal correlation distributions for inclusive cluster trigger and @xmath0 triggers on the trigger particles with @xmath15  gev / c in pp collisions at @xmath16  =  7  tev . ]",
    "azimuthal correlation distributions for inclusive cluster trigger and @xmath0 triggers on the trigger particles with @xmath15  gev / c in pp collisions at @xmath16  =  7  tev . ]    by selecting isolated triggers , i.e. the trigger satisfies : the sum of the transverse momentum of the hadrons inside a cone with size @xmath17 around the trigger candidate carries less than 10  % of the trigger s transverse momentum , we can enrich the sample with direct photons or single hadron jets .",
    "the near side peak is suppressed by construction , whereas the away side peak remains and a slight difference is due to the imperfect isolation parameters used in the analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : isoemctrigdphi ] ) indicating the existence of di - jet events with one of the jet being a hard fragmenting jet or eventually a direct photon .",
    "because of the hadronization , we do not have direct access to the parton kinematics and therefore can measure neither the fragmentation function nor the magnitude of partonic transverse momentum @xmath1 which modifies the ideal @xmath18 kinematics .",
    "however , the isolated photon/@xmath0 triggered correlation could be used to extract the partonic level kinematics to the extend that the leading order kinematics dominates , as suggested by the phenix analysis  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the trigger fragmentation variable and @xmath21 is the ratio between away and near side hard scattered partons , @xmath22 is similar to @xmath23 but at the hadronic level , and @xmath24 is the projection of trigger particle deviates from the parton before fragmentation ( see detail in  @xcite ) .",
    "the values of @xmath25 are determined by measuring the width of the away side peak @xmath26 , using the fitting function described in  @xcite .",
    "the fitted away side peak width shows in fig .",
    "[ fig : pout ] , the width is weakly depend on the trigger @xmath2 .",
    "the isolated trigger represents the hard scattered parton direction approximately ( @xmath27 ) , therefore , @xmath28  1 and @xmath290 .",
    "the @xmath25 values we have measured for @xmath30gev / c and @xmath31gev / c is consistent with another measurement obtained from charged di - hardon correlations in alice .",
    "the measured value agrees the extrapolated value at lhc energies from available worldwide data  @xcite .        however this preliminary analysis does not allow to draw any conclusion other than these results indicate the expected behavior .",
    "exciting physics will certainly come with the final analysis of large statistics within well - calibrated detectors and all efficiency corrections .",
