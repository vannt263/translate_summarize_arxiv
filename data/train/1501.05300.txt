    "thus their sample is dominated by low - mass young - stellar - object ( yso ) environments .",
    "b10 argue that if `` clustered '' star - formation and `` distributed '' star - formation were two distinct star - formation processes , then `` clustered '' and `` distributed '' populations should appear as distinct modes in the surface - density distribution ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that such a scenario could be tested by searching for a `` scale '' of star formation separating these two modes .",
    "such a kink in the surface - density distribution has been used in some investigations of the structure of young stellar clusters , for example by @xcite , to separate distinct clusters of stars in star - forming regions .",
    "given that b10 find a smooth distributions of surface density from their data , which they report is adequately fit by a log - normal distribution with a peak at 22  stars  pc@xmath3 , they conclude that no such `` scale '' exists , at least for low - mass yso environments present in the solar neighborhood .",
    "nevertheless , the log - normal distribution from b10 is not scale free , but instead a peak at 22  stars  pc@xmath3 and width of 0.85  dex suggests a density distribution weighted towards low - density environments .",
    "if this result is a general characteristic of most star formation in the galaxy , rather than just the nearby regions investigated by b10 , it would have implications for theories of star formation as numerous researchers have discussed .",
    "for example , @xcite find that their models of local - density - driven star formation from a single molecular clump could produce the 22  stars  pc@xmath3 scale from b10 .",
    "@xcite suggest that surface densities significantly greater than 22  stars  pc@xmath3 could indicate that a cluster has undergone a `` cool collapse phase . ''",
    "@xcite present a model in which the low fraction of star - formation that results in bound clusters is , in part , a result of a density spectrum weighted towards low surface densities .",
    "@xcite notes that dynamical processing of primordial binaries by clusters depends on whether most stars form in low density regions as suggested by b10 , or whether higher density clusters are more common . and , @xcite investigate the threshold densities in star - forming regions where stellar interactions affect habitable planet formation  and the fraction of the stars born in environments above their @xmath8  stars  pc@xmath3 threshold would depend on whether high - density regions are just a tail of the b10 log - normal or a different mode not seen in the b10 sample .",
    "b10 support this interpretaton of the empirical results from their sample stating , `` only a small fraction ( @xmath926 per cent ) of stars form in dense clusters where their formation and/or evolution is expected to be influenced by their surroundings . ''",
    "it is important to investigate whether these results continue to hold for more massive star - forming regions ( those regions containing o - type stars ) .",
    "nearly 70% of b10 s sample comes from the orion giant molecular clouds , which do contain o - type stars , but they note that the ir - excess methods used are ineffective at identifying young stars in the presence of nebulosity and crowding in this complex .",
    "their other star - forming regions are lower mass .",
    "given that studies of the mass function for star - forming regions favor the birth of stars in more massive complexes , investigation of these complexes in a way that is more effective at probing the densest regions could be helpful for determining the validity of b10 s suggestion that clustered stars ( @xmath10  stars  pc@xmath3 ) exist in the tail of the surface - density distribution , rather than being a dominant component .",
    "nevertheless , a definitive study of surface - density distributions for star formation would require the construction of an unbiased survey of all star - forming environments .",
    "mystix  neither includes the most massive star - forming environments in the galaxy ( such as w  43 , wd  1 , ngc  3603 , or the arches cluster ) nor includes large angular area studies of diffuse molecular clouds necessary to capture the lowest surface density environments .",

    ", they concluded that the histogram of surface densities alone is not sufficient for determining which stars are clustered and which stars are not .",
    "this assertion is supported by @xcite who demonstrate that even if all stars are born in clusters , cluster expansion can yield a variety of different surface density distributions , including the log - normal distribution of b10 .",
    "@xcite additionally demonstrate that for @xcite cluster density profiles , the low density portion of the cluster outside the dense core can make it difficult to identify distinct peaks in the @xmath66 distribution , even if they do exist .",

    "another conclusion of b10 is that the unimodal log - normal distribution  peaked at 22  stars  pc@xmath3 with standard deviation width of 0.85  dex  means that most stars form outside clusters , while densities like 100 , 1000 , 10,000  stars  pc@xmath3 are in the tail of the distribution .",

    "they choose a surface - density threshold of 200  stars  pc@xmath3 to be their definition of a cluster because this is where stars become likely to interact with their neighbors .",
    "@xcite and @xcite caution about using projected surface - densities to estimate the fraction of stars undergoing local dynamical interactions because analysis of the empirical surface - density histograms for a sample does not take into account cluster evolution , radial cluster structure , and superposition of discrete clusters .",
    "thus , they argue that stellar interaction could be important even if the empirical histograms show most stars lie in environments below an astrophysically selected threshold like 200  stars  pc@xmath3 .    both mystix  and b10 investigate star - formation in the orion giant molecular clouds , including the orion  a and  b molecular clouds , containing the orion nebula and flame nebula , respectively , making this a useful region to directly compare results .",

    "but their results are likely to be reasonable for other nearby star - forming clouds that are less affected by crowding and nebulosity , although scalings to include disk - free subpopulations may vary .",
    "nevertheless , the high surface densities seen in other msfrs indicate that the results for the orion molecular clouds are not anomalous , and may indeed be typical for most stars , in the context of galactic star - formation . the initial cluster mass function described by a power - law with index of approximately -2 over a large cluster mass range @xcite ,",
    "would imply that stars are roughly equally likely to form in complexes of different masses .",
    "this would mean that star formation is evenly spread between small taurus / chamaelion - type clouds with tens - to - hundreds of stars , smaller ob star - forming regions like ngc  2264 containing hundreds to thousands of stars , giant molecular clouds like the orion compelex containing thousands to @xmath82 stars , and major star - forming complexes like carina containing @xmath82@xmath83 stars .",

    "our models , which estimate the spatial surface density in star - forming regions , are the composite of multiple parametric models for each of the clustered and unclustered subpopulations .",
    "the subclusters were modeled using ellipsoidal surface density profiles , similar to the model forms investigated by @xcite and @xcite , and an additional spatially - constant component was added to account for stars that are not part of any subcluster . the number of subclusters , the subcluster parameters , and the number of stars in each component were determined by model fitting with model selection based on the widely - used akaike information criterion penalized likelihood measure .",
    "this method requires a parametric form to be assumed for the subcluster models , and assumes that stars which are not part of subclusters are uniformly distributed , which are not necessarily accurate assumptions ; however , the best - fit results in paper  i show that these models are able to reproduce the observed surface density distributions with low - amplitude residual maps .",

    "the number of unclustered stars from our analysis differs from the results of @xcite in carina and @xcite in ngc  6334 because those studies use a threshold method , while we use the mixture model method .",

    "the stars that are part of the latter component could be made up of stars that formed in relatively isolated parts of a msfr , an earlier generation of star - formation that has been dispersed , stars that drifted away from subclusters , or clumps of stars with too few members to be identified as subclusters .",
    "some of the complexes with larger fractions of unclustered stars include younger regions with more active star formation , for example w  40 ( 20% unclustered ) , ngc  2264 ( 18% unclustered ) , and the rosette molecular cloud ( 22% unclustered )",
    ". this may be the result of young stars forming in networks of molecular filaments outside the main cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could later become incorporated into the cluster in a hierarchical merger scenario @xcite . in contrast , for dr  21 ( 13% unclustered ) the youngest objects tend to be embedded in the dense filament passing through the center of the cluster , while the unclustered objects have an older median age @xcite .",
    "the consistently low fraction of stars in the unclustered components of the mystix  regions highlights that the distribution of stars is very clumpy , rather than spatially smooth .",

    "the variation in the shape of these distributions indicates that there is no universal surface - density distribution applicable to all types of star - forming regions and no special value of surface density characteristic of galactic star formation . * in the mystix  regions , more than half of the young stars lie in regions with high surface densities with 100 - 10,000  stars  pc@xmath3 .",
    "given that most stars form in star - forming regions containing o - type stars , this result suggests that a large fraction of stars in the galaxy formed in such dense environments . nevertheless , a quantitative determination of how great this contribution would be would require an unbiased survey of many different star - forming environments .",

    "<S> we investigate the intrinsic stellar populations ( estimated total numbers of ob and pre  main - sequence stars down to 0.1  @xmath0 ) that are present in 17 massive star - forming regions ( msfrs ) surveyed by the mystix project . </S>",
    "<S> the study is based on the catalog of @xmath131,000 mystix probable complex members with both disk - bearing and disk - free populations , compensating for extinction , nebulosity , and crowding effects . </S>",
    "<S> correction for observational sensitivities is made using the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) and the near - infrared initial mass function ( imf)a correction that is often not made by infrared surveys of young stars . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting maps of the projected structure of the young stellar populations , in units of intrinsic stellar surface density , allow direct comparison between different regions . </S>",
    "<S> several regions have multiple dense clumps , similar in size and density to the orion nebula cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the highest projected density of @xmath234,000  stars  pc@xmath3 is found in the core of the rcw  38 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> histograms of surface density show different ranges of values in different regions , supporting the conclusion of bressert et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2010 , b10 ) that no universal surface - density threshold can distinguish between clustered and distributed star - formation . </S>",
    "<S> however , a large component of the young stellar population of msfrs resides in dense environments of 20010,000  stars  pc@xmath3 ( including within the nearby orion molecular clouds ) , and we find that there is no evidence for the b10 conclusion that such dense regions form an extreme `` tail '' of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> tables of intrinsic populations for these regions are used in our companion study of young cluster properties and evolution . </S>"
