    "one - dimensional quasiperiodic potentials have been the object of an extensive theoretical investigation since the 80 s @xcite , owing to their interesting feature of having a spatial ordering that is intermediate between periodicity and disorder .",
    "the paradigm of this class of models is the so called harper @xcite or aubry - andre model @xcite , described by the following hamiltonian @xmath0 that , for a certain class of irrational values of @xmath1 @xcite , displays a `` metal - insulator '' phase transition from extended to exponentially localized states , just as anderson localization in random systems in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this model has the interesting properties of being self - dual under a suitable transformation to momentum space , the self - dual point being @xmath2 at which the transition occurs @xcite .",
    "this kind of hamiltonians can now be engineered with ultracold atoms loaded in optical lattices @xcite , opening the way to study the localization properties of quasiperiodic systems from the experimental point of view .",
    "the first experimental observation of anderson localization in quasiperiodic potentials has been recently reported in @xcite .",
    "this experiment has been realized by using a non interacting bose - einstein condensate loaded in a bichromatic potential , obtained by superimposing two one - dimensional optical lattices with different wavelengths .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the localization properties of the bichromatic potential employed in current experiments , discussing the relationship with the discrete model in ( [ eq : aa - hamiltonian ] ) , and also the effect of the finite size of the system due to the presence of an additional harmonic confinement",
    ". we will provide evidences on how exponentially localized states emerge upon increasing the degree of incommensurability of the system , and how the transition from extended to localized states can be extracted from the momentum distribution , that is easily accessible in current experiments from the absorption images after a time of flight @xcite .",
    "recent experiments with cold atomic samples feature a one - dimensional bichromatic potential obtained by superimposing two optical lattices , of the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the lattice wavenumbers , @xmath6 are the heights of the two lattices in units of their recoil energies @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is an arbitrary phase . in general , the potential of wavelength @xmath9 is used to create a tight binding primary lattice , of period @xmath10 , that is weakly perturbed by the secondary lattice of wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the single particle properties of the potential @xmath12 are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath13 that can be conveniently rewritten in units of main lattice parameters ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 as units of lenghts and energies , respectively ) as @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it can be easily demonstrated that the presence of the second lattice does not change substantially the position of the minima but instead shifts the energies in a range of size @xmath20 @xcite .      in the tight - binding limit",
    "this system can be mapped to the aubry - andr model @xcite by expanding the particle wavefunction @xmath21 over a set of wannier states , maximally localized at the minima of the primary lattice ( from now on `` lattice sites '' , labelled by @xmath22 ) @xmath23 , in the _ lowest band _ , @xmath24 .",
    "the aubry - andr model can be written in terms of the projector over the wannier states as @xmath25 or in terms of the @xmath26 coefficients @xmath27    let us evaluate explicitly the expectation value of the hamiltonian on the wannier basis ; in the tight binding limit we can make the following approximation @xmath28 with @xmath29 where we have retained only the onsite contribution of the secondary lattice @xcite and the tunneling between nearest neighbouring sites @xcite ( for shallow lattices , the interaction between wannier states beyond nearest neighbours becomes relevant too @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : jtunnel ] ) , ( [ eq : delta ] ) in terms of the maximally localized wannier functions .",

    "we note that in the literature it is common to find @xmath37 defined without the exponential factor @xcite ; though this is a legitimate definition of the intensity of the secondary lattice , the contribution of the exponential correction may be necessary for a precise mapping between the continuous and the discrete models , depending on the values of @xmath38 and @xmath1 .",
    "a common choice in the study of the aubry - andr model is the inverse of the golden ratio , @xmath47 , for which the model displays a `` metal - insulator '' phase transition from extended to localized states at @xmath2 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the insulator phase is characterized by the absence of mobility edges , all the eigenstates being exponentially localized with the same localization length @xmath48 .",
    "this case has been extensively investigated in the literature , see e.g. @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view , a necessary and sufficient condition to display a sharp transition is @xmath1 to be an irrational diophantine number @xcite . however , in the real world one has to be aware of two facts : _",

    "this means that what really matters is not the distinction between commensurable and incommensurable , but the actual _ degree of commensurability _ and the ratio between the periodicity of the potential and the system size ( fixed by the boundary conditions ) . in practice , in order to observe a transition from extended to localized states it is sufficient to have a large enough number of lattice sites within the actual periodicity of the potential , and a system size that does not greatly exceed the latter ( in order to avoid periodic replicas ) .    to illustrate how the properties of the system change by varying the degree of commensurability",
