    "hamming space @xmath18 of binary @xmath0-strings , equipped with the hamming distance is one of the classical objects studied in combinatorics .",
    "its properties that received significant attention are the maximal packing densities , covering numbers , isoperimetric inequalities , list - decoding properties , etc . in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying metric properties of maps @xmath19 between hamming spaces of different dimensions .",
    "indeed , frequently one is interested in embedding @xmath18 into @xmath20 `` expansively '' , i.e. so that points that were far apart in @xmath18 remain far apart in @xmath20 .",
    "two immediate examples of such maps are : the error - correcting codes with rate @xmath21 and minimum distance @xmath9 satisfy @xmath22 where here and below @xmath23 is the hamming weight of the vector .",
    "another example is the repetition coding with @xmath24 mapping @xmath25 into @xmath26 repetitions of @xmath25 .",
    "this map satisfies : @xmath27    with these two examples in mind , we introduce the main concept of this paper .",
    "[ def : ab ] a map @xmath28 is called an @xmath29-map ( or simply an @xmath2-map ) if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are integers and for all @xmath30 we have either @xmath31 where @xmath18 is the hamming space of dimension @xmath0 over the binary field .",
    "we next define the hamming graphs @xmath7 for integer @xmath32 $ ] as follows : @xmath33 by @xmath34 and @xmath35 we denote the vertices of @xmath36 , the edges of @xmath36 and the cardinality of the maximal independent set of @xmath36 .",
    "all graphs in this paper are simple ( without self - loops and multiple edges ) . by @xmath37",
    "we denote the ( simple ) graph obtained by complementing @xmath38 and deleting self - loops .",
    "the relevance of hamming graphs to this paper comes from the simple observation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the existence of a graph homomorphism ( see section  [ sec : hom ] for definition ) .",
    "this paper focuses on proving negative results showing impossibility of certain parameters @xmath41 .",
    "note that there are a variety of methods that we can use to disprove existence of graph homomorphisms .",
    "for example , by computing the shortest odd cycle we can prove @xmath42 in this paper , however , we are interested in the methods that provide some useful information in the asymptotic regime of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and fixed @xmath2 .",
    "our original motivation for definition  [ def : ab ] was the following .",
    "suppose the map @xmath19 is used to protect the @xmath0 data bits against noise .",
    "if the points @xmath45 are far apart but @xmath24 and @xmath46 are close , i.e. if a map fails to satisfy  ( [ eq : def_ab ] ) , then @xmath24 may be confused with @xmath46 in a noisy environment . consequently , this would lead to a severe discrepancy if @xmath47 is reported instead of @xmath25 .",
    "below we briefly discuss how @xmath2-property relates to some previously studied concepts .",
    "first , a @xmath48-map is simply an error - correcting code of rate @xmath21 and minimum distance @xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath2-condition is a _ relaxation of the minimum - distance property : _ the separation of @xmath49 is only guaranteed for data vectors @xmath50 that were @xmath51 apart to start with .",
    "practically , data may have some structure guaranteeing some separation between feasible data - vectors ( e.g. if @xmath25 is english test , changing one letter is unlikely to result in a grammatically correct phrase ) .",
    "second , in the inverse problem of reconstructing @xmath25 from a noisy version @xmath52 , one may proceed by computing a pre - image of the hamming ball of radius @xmath53 around @xmath54 . then the @xmath2-condition guarantees that the points in the pre - image will all be close to each other .",
    "third , an @xmath2-map can be used to convert a code with ( normalized ) minimal distance @xmath55 to a code of minimal distance @xmath56 at the expense of losing a factor @xmath57 in rate .",
    "this observation leads , on one hand , to a non - trivial bound on achievable parameters @xmath2 , see  ( [ eq : ccb ] ) below . on the other hand",
    ", it also suggests that @xmath2-maps could be employed for adapting properties of a fixed mother code to the changing noise environment .",
    "fourth , an @xmath2-map with @xmath58 can be seen as a type of hashing in which one wants the hashes of dissimilar strings to be also dissimilar .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2-condition is weakening of the locality - sensitive hashing condition  @xcite .",
    "finally , relaxation of the minimum - distance property taken in definition  [ def : ab ] may be motivated by availability of the redundancy in the @xmath0-bit data . in information theory transmitting such data across a noisy channel is known as the joint source - channel coding ( jscc ) problem .",
    "combinatorial variation , cf .",
    "@xcite , can be stated as follows : say that @xmath28 is a @xmath59-jscc if there exists a decoder map @xmath60 with the property",
    "@xmath61 the operational meaning is that a @xmath59-jscc reduces the ( adversarial ) noise of strength @xmath62 in @xmath1-space to ( adversarial ) noise of strength @xmath63 in @xmath0-space .",
    "a special case of @xmath64 was introduced by spielman  @xcite under the name of _ error - reducing _ codes .",
    "the connection to def .",
    "[ def : ab ] comes from the simple observation : @xmath65 thus , every impossibility result for @xmath2-maps implies impossibility results for @xmath59-jscc and spielman s error - reducing codes .",
    "for @xmath5 the best known bound to date is due to mceliece et al  @xcite .",
    "it says that any set @xmath66 with @xmath67 for all @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 where @xmath70 for @xmath71 and for @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and the minimum is taken over all @xmath75 satisfying @xmath76 for distances @xmath77 the solution is given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 has a simpler expression : @xmath80    thus from  ( [ eq : mrrw ] ) we get @xmath81 a natural question is whether going from @xmath5 to @xmath82 may enable larger rates @xmath83 .    the first impulse could be that the answer is negative .",
    "indeed , note that for @xmath84 there is @xmath85 points @xmath47 s.t .",
    "thus it may seem that for @xmath84 this relaxation yields no improvements ( asymptotically ) compared to @xmath5 .",
    "this observation is incorrect for two reasons .",
    "first , we do not require @xmath87 to be injective  thus although all points @xmath46 are far from @xmath24 , they may not all be distinct .",
    "second , even though each @xmath25 has many @xmath47 satisfying @xmath86 , we in fact need a collection @xmath88 s.t .",
    "@xmath86 for all _ pairs _ @xmath89 .",
    "only then we may conclude that @xmath90 is code in @xmath20 with large minimal distance .",
    "thus , @xmath91 needs to be an independent set in @xmath92 .",
    "how large can it be ? to that end , we recall turan s theorem , cf .",
    "* theorem iv.6 ) : @xmath93 counting the number of edges of the graph @xmath92 via stirling s formula we get @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , @xmath95 consequently , if an @xmath41-map exists then comparing  ( [ eq : mrrw ] ) and  ( [ eq : gv1 ] ) we get @xmath96    one natural way to improve the bound would be to notice that graphs @xmath97 have a lot of extra structure and perhaps simplistic estimate  ( [ eq : gv1 ] ) via turan s theorem can be improved . unfortunately , despite decades of work the lower bound  ( [ eq : gv1 ] ) , known as the gilbert - varshamov bound , is asymptotically the best known .",
    "( for non - binary alphabets , however , better bounds exist  @xcite . )    instead , the next theorem improves  ( [ eq : ccb ] ) by establishing how another graph - function ( the @xmath12-function , see  ( [ eq : ts_max ] ) below ) behaves under graph homomorphisms , and then applying known results on @xmath12-function for hamming graphs established by samorodnitsky  @xcite and mceliece et al .",
