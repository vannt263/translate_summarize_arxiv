    "the problem of dissociation of bound states in a hot qcd medium is of great importance in heavy ion collisions as it provides evidence for the creation of the quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in order to get a better understanding of the properties of this state of matter it is necessary to establish criteria under which bound states are not allowed to exist or are broken apart .",
    "we focus on the study of two particular mechanisms which we believe to be the main causes of dissociation in the plasma : debye screening and multiple scattering with constituents of the plasma .",
    "in ref.@xcite , the authors discussed @xmath4 suppression due to debye screening by the quark - gluon plasma and the importance of this signature to diagnose quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "they found that the criterion for the dissociation of a @xmath4 at rest is @xmath5 with @xmath6 , the debye screening length .",
    "in contrast , for a heavy quark - antiquark pair moving at velocity @xmath7 in an infinite strongly coupled @xmath8 sym plasma , the ads / cft calculation shows that the screening length goes like @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this suggests we may expect a criterion for the dissociation of heavy quarkonia in such a strongly coupled plasma of the form @xmath10 .",
    "as for the dissociation due to multiple scattering with the constituents of the plasma , ref .",
    "@xcite addresses the problem of heavy meson suppression in a finite dense qcd medium and predicts suppression of @xmath11-mesons comparable to that of @xmath12-mesons at transverse momenta as low as @xmath13 gev .",
    "the calculation of the screening effect for mesons at rest is not enough to understand the suppression observed in the data from heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is also important to establish when a fast moving meson is broken apart due to the presence of the plasma .",
    "the latter case is the one explicitly addressed in this paper . for the screening effect ,",
    "the full calculation is too complicated to be performed analytically and there is not an obvious way of getting a simple picture where we can get a good estimate based on the uncertainty principle as done in @xcite . by considering the dirac equation in light - cone coordinates and in light - cone gauge we propose a schrdinger - like equation where we can rely on the uncertainty principle to get a sensible estimate for the criterion for dissociation of bound states .",
    "this approach requires the calculation of the effective field produced by a fast moving charge with respect to the plasma , which is done in the appropriate region of momenta where we keep terms only up to first order in @xmath14 . even though in covariant gauge the effective field in the rest frame of the charge moving relative to the plasma with @xmath15 is highly anisotropic@xcite",
    ", we find that after a gauge transformation and going back to the rest frame of the plasma , the anisotropy is suppressed as inverse powers of @xmath16 compared to that due to the lorentz contraction .",
    "we find that the criterion @xmath17 is also parametrically true for fast moving heavy mesons .    for multiple scattering",
    "we get a criterion for dissociation in terms of the saturation momentum of the system @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 . for this purpose",
    "we first identify the typical time between interactions inside the meson @xmath20 . then the criterion for dissociation",
    "is given by the statement that if the quarks inside the meson pick up enough transverse momentum during that period then the meson breaks up .",
    "we take as the natural scale for transverse momentum inside of the heavy meson @xmath21 .",
    "the transverse momentum broadening is given by @xmath18 where the role of the lenght of the plasma is played by @xmath20 ( assuming an infinite plasma ) .",
    "in the case of uncorrelated multiple scattering , the criterion @xmath22 gives @xmath23^{1\\over 3}t},\\ ] ] with @xmath1 .",
    "it is also parametrically true for the dissociation of heavy mesons almost at rest with the plasma . comparing this result with the criterion obtained from the screening effect",
    "we conclude that , in an infinite plasma , multiple scattering is a more efficient mechanism for the dissociation of heavy mesons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , by analyzing the dirac equation , we conclude that those photons with @xmath24 and @xmath25 are essential for the binding in the partonic language and get a schrdinger - like equation in light - cone gauge in light - cone coordinates .",
    "we also discuss the typical time scale @xmath26 in a heavy meson . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the effective field induced by a fast moving charge in light - cone gauge up to the first order in @xmath14 and use the uncertainty principle to estimate the criterion for the dissociation of fast moving heavy mesons . in sec .",
    "iv , we give a parametric estimate for the dissociation of heavy mesons due to multiple scattering in an infinite hot quark - gluon plasma . in the appendix , we compare the classical field @xmath27 calculated from classical electrodynamics and from qft to illustrate the connection between the classical field and virtual photons .",
    "even though the correct mathematical treatment of a relativistic two - body system can be done by means of the bethe - salpeter equation , we choose to use the dirac equation instead in order to get a simpler physical picture .",
    "this approximation is valid when one of the particles involved is much heavier than the other , in which case the field produced by the heavier particle is no longer a dynamical variable and can be treated as an external field . in this framework , we can investigate the general properties of the wave function of the lighter quark and determine under which conditions it will be bound . in order to be able to treat the system perturbatively we still have to assume both masses are much larger than @xmath28 with one of the masses much greater than the other .",
    "although the formal results are only valid in this case , we believe the parametric result should be the same for the case of equal masses .",
    "we assume that the plasma is in the deconfinement phase and in the perturbative regime . in this circumstance",
    ", we can treat the problem in the quark - gluon plasma in a similar way as that in a qed plasma .    in the following",
    "we first investigate the role played by photons with momenta in different regions in the binding of a fast moving bound state and address the question of what is the approximate equation , appropriate for such a system , analogous to the schrdinger equation for a bound state at rest .",
    "then , we answer the question under which circumstances our analysis of the qed bound states applies to heavy mesons . we also give a brief illustration about the typical time scale @xmath26 based on the perturbative definition of the wave function at the end of this section .",
    "since the detailed screening effect for a moving bound state is too complicated to be solved analytically @xcite , we try to simplify the problem and make it suitable for an intuitive understanding by analyzing the dirac equation for a fast moving bound state and determining which photons are essential for the binding .",
    "this will allow us to make appropriate approximations to the calculation of the effective field induced by the heavier particle in the presence of the plasma . with the effective field , we still need a schrdinger - like equation in light - cone coordinates which manifests the uncertainty principle and simplifies the spin structure in order to enable us to use a physical analysis of fast moving bound states similar to that for bound states at rest in ref . @xcite . in the following analysis",
    ", we assume that the lighter particle has a mass @xmath29 and a charge @xmath30 while the heavier particle has a mass @xmath31 and a charge @xmath32 .",
    "the whole analysis in the following applies to heavy mesons provided the quarks are heavy enough .      in the vacuum case the field",
    "@xmath27 is much simpler , in certain gauges , in the rest frame of the bound state .",
    "therefore , let us start with this simpler case and assume that we have already solved @xmath33 , the wave function in the rest frame of the bound state , which peaks at @xmath34 with a width @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . by boosting to the lab frame , we obtain @xmath37 which peaks at @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . by writing @xmath43 and inserting it into the dirac equation in momentum space @xmath44,\\label{de } \\end{split}\\ ] ]",
    "we get , in the chiral representation@xcite , @xmath45 given the above general properties of @xmath46 , we easily see that @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 gives the predominant contribution to the @xmath50 integration in the right hand side of ( [ diracequation2spinorm ] ) . as reviewed in the appendix , in qed the classical field @xmath51 arises from virtual photons with momenta @xmath52 in the wave - function of the heavier particle in the same gauge .",
    "therefore , we conclude in the partonic language that those photons with @xmath24 and @xmath53 are essential for the binding of a bound state moving at velocity @xmath7 .",
    "this analysis allows us to give a qualitative picture of how the binding is affected by the presence of the plasma and under which circumstances the existence of bound states is not allowed . as will be seen in the next section , the presence of the plasma becomes manifest through an effective photon mass @xmath54 , which causes the corresponding screening effect .",
    "this effective mass provides a cut - off on the lower limit of the integration on the right hand side of ( [ diracequation2spinorm ] ) and , therefore , determines if the photons responsible for the binding are still available . following this argument , the criterion for the dissociation of bound states at rest in a plasma is @xmath55 .    back to the limit @xmath15 ,",
    "the arguments stated above show that we can focus only on the contribution to the field from photons with @xmath56 . before doing this , we need a simplified dirac equation in light - cone coordinates which will enable us to use an uncertainty principle analysis for a fast moving bound state .      in order to determine the existence of fast moving bound states in the presence of the plasma we would have to solve the dirac equation corresponding to that system . for the present case ,",
    "the dirac equation is too complicated to be solved exactly .",
    "nevertheless , we can get an approximate schrdinger - like equation which will put us on familiar grounds to make order of magnitude estimates on the conditions under which bound states are allowed to exist .",
    "the major difficulty comes from the fact that in the rest frame of the charge the effective field is highly anisotropic in the limit @xmath15@xcite .",
    "in contrast , as showed in sec . [ effectivelcg ] , in the reference frame with the plasma at rest , the anisotropy of the effective field in light - cone gauge is predominately due to the lorentz contraction and can be easily handled when expressed in light - cone coordinates .",
    "this allows us to neglect the anisotropy of other kinds and greatly simplify the problem . by using light - cone coordinates and keeping terms up to @xmath57 we are able to derive an equation in which , by means of the uncertainty principle , we can establish necessary conditions for the existence of a bound state",
    ".    in coordinate space , the dirac equation ( [ diracequation2spinorm ] ) takes the form @xmath58 from which we can get two second order differential equations @xmath59 after some algebra we get @xmath60\\varphi = m_a^2\\varphi\\\\              \\left[(p - e_aa)^2+e_a(\\vec{b}-i\\vec{e})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}\\right]\\chi = m_a^2\\chi          \\end{array }          \\right .. \\label{diracequationfields}\\ ] ] in the following we only keep terms with expectation value up to @xmath61 and neglect terms which are higher order in @xmath62 . under this assumption",
    "the second term can be ignored in eq .",
    "( [ diracequationfields ] ) in both of the equations given there .",
    "we show a detailed calculation of the potential for the vacuum case in the appendix which supports this statement . in the plasma",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are screened and are even weaker than in the vacuum case .",
    "since the two equations are the same in this approximation , let us focus on one of them @xmath63 even though the dominant part of the potential is in the transverse components , the main contribution in the equation above comes from the @xmath64 component since it is enhanced by a @xmath65 factor .",
    "in this way we get a schrdinger - like equation in light - cone gauge in light - cone coordinates @xmath66\\varphi,\\label{schoedinginlc}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath68 is of order @xmath69 and then we have dropped terms which are higher order in @xmath62 . in this paper",
    ", we will not solve ( [ schoedinginlc ] ) exactly , but instead we will use the uncertainty principle to estimate the existence of bound state solutions in the limit @xmath15 . inspired by ( [ schoedinginlc ] ) , we start with @xmath70 where @xmath71^{1\\over 2}\\simeq\\sqrt{\\left < p^{+2}\\right>}\\left[1-{\\left<\\delta",

    "that @xmath73 only depends on @xmath74 , that is , the system has a generalized rotational symmetry , we may expect @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . except for the different definitions of the 3-components of @xmath78 and @xmath79 ,",
    "the physical meaning of ( [ schoedingerinlcup ] ) is exactly the same as that used in the uncertainty principle analysis from the schrdinger equation . in the vacuum case",
    ", we have @xmath80 in light - cone gauge as calculated in the appendix , and @xmath81 in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "by using the uncertainty principle we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the results obtained from boosted wave functions by keeping terms up to @xmath61 in binding energy .",
    "therefore , as in the limit @xmath85 , we can get a schrdinger - like equation in the limit @xmath15 which allows us to use the uncertainty principle to estimate the properties of fast moving bound states .    before calculating the plasma effect on the effective potential , we give a quantitative estimate about how well the color coulomb ( perturbative ) potential applies to the heavy mesons in the vacuum . using the uncertainty principle with the cornell confining potential @xmath86@xcite",
    ", we have @xmath87 which tells us that if @xmath88 we may neglect the non - perturbative linear potential responsible for the confinement in @xmath89 .",
    "in this case the discussion about the electromagnetic bound state given in this section is also valid for the heavy meson if we replace @xmath62 with @xmath90 . for the charm quark , @xmath91 with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "for the bottom quark , @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 . even though for the charm and the bottom , equation ( [ ispert ] ) is not perfectly satisfied , as a parametric estimate in the following sections we can still take the binding energy @xmath97 .      from a perturbative point of view , the interaction between the two quarks in a heavy meson occurs via interchange of gluons .",
    "it is possible to define a typical time within which we can neglect the interaction between them",
    ". this time scale will play an important role in establishing the appropriate criterion for dissociation due to multiple scattering .",
    "let us start with the perturbative definition of the wave function@xcite , @xmath98_{\\alpha\\rho } \\psi_{n\\rho}(x^\\prime_a)\\\\ & -ie_a\\int d^4x^\\prime_a\\left[s^a_f(x_a - x^\\prime_a)a\\llap{$/$}(x^\\prime_a)\\right]_{\\alpha\\rho } \\psi_{n\\rho}(x^\\prime_a),\\label{bse } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the volume element of the closed 3-dimensional surface of a region of space time containing @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the inward drawn unit normal vector of this surface at @xmath102 , @xmath27 is calculated perturbatively by the one - gluon exchange approximation and we neglect the linear potential responsible for the confinement since the masses are assumed much greater than @xmath28 .",
    "choosing the integration surface on the first term on the right hand side of ( [ bse ] ) as the whole space at two different fixed times , we can relate the wave function at time @xmath103 to the values of the wave function at a previous time @xmath104 . if @xmath105 , the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ bse ] ) gives the predominant contribution to the wave function at @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , by conservation of probability , one can neglect the second term , that is , the interaction between these two quarks can be neglected .",
    "this is easy to see in light - cone coordinates , where the free propagator is @xcite @xmath107,\\label{propfermlc}\\ ] ] with @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is integrated over the region @xmath111 .",
    "if typically @xmath112 , one can neglect it in the exponentials in ( [ propfermlc ] ) and , therefore , the integration of @xmath113 in the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ bse ] ) simply gives a @xmath114-function to reproduce the wave function at @xmath106 in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath115 , the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ bse ] ) is highly suppressed due to this big term in the exponentials in the @xmath116 integration and , therefore , the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ bse ] ) contributes predominately by conservation of probability .",
    "approximately , the picture of interaction between the two quarks in such a heavy meson is that the lighter quark interacts with the color field generated by the heavier quark once every interval @xmath117 .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",

    "if @xmath119 , the wave packet propagated by the free propagator represents the predominant contribution to the wave function at @xmath120 . approximately , the picture of the interaction between the two quarks in a heavy meson is that quark @xmath121 is kicked once by the color field of quark @xmath118 within a period @xmath122 to pull it back into the heavy meson.,width=377 ]",
    "the next step following our analysis of the dirac equation would be to calculate the appropriate potential for a fast moving particle to plug into equation ( [ schoedingerinlcup ] ) .",
    "however , this whole analysis ignores completely the effect of multiple scattering with the particles in the medium , which can modify strongly the wave function of the system .",
    "although in general these two mechanisms interfere , we will treat them separately in order to determine which one is dominant and which one should be used to establish a criterion for existence of bound states in the plasma .",
    "this approximation relies on the fact that screening is a coherent effect involving a correlated motion of particles in the medium , unlike multiple scattering which is an incoherent effect caused by random kicks from uncorrelated scattering centers . in this section",
    ", we will give a detailed calculation for the hot qed plasma , and generalize the results to the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "first , let us calculate the screening effect on the field induced by the heavy particle , due to the presence of the plasma .",
    "this is done by calculating the retarded photon propagator in thermal field theory for different regions of momenta .",
    "following the analysis presented in the previous section , we are mainly interested in those photons with momenta @xmath123 , which are essential for the binding of a fast moving bound state . in the following calculation of the retarded photon propagator , we keep terms only up to first order in @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , we neglect the modification of @xmath27 due to the appearance of the lighter particle ( for a detailed discussion , from the kinetic theory point of view , about the effective field @xmath27 in the rest frame of the particles and the influence of the appearance of another heavy particle see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "even though the photon polarization vector within the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation is well - known ( say , @xcite ) , in the following we still present some details of the calculation , which enables us to see how well our approximation is in the regions of momenta beyond the htl approximation .    using the notation in ref .",

    "( [ photonpolarization ] ) , we have @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 . after taking the trace and performing the frequency sums",
    "we get , @xmath133 and @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .    in the htl approximation ,",
    "that is , @xmath138 , we get the well - known results @xmath139 and @xmath140 where we have dropped the @xmath141-independent divergent term and we have taken @xmath142 . when making use of the classical current induced by a fast moving particle , we introduce a delta function of the form @xmath143 , so we can safely replace @xmath144 in the calculation of the propagator . in our case @xmath145 , by keeping only the first order of @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 and , therefore , @xmath148      as explained in previous sections , photons with @xmath149 play an important role in the calculation of bound state wave functions , and since we are interested in fast moving particles , @xmath150 might be comparable with or even larger than @xmath141 in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse components of the photon momenta are not necessarily large .",
    "the relevant region for the transverse momenta is @xmath151 and in particular we would like to focus on the region @xmath152 , which means we still have the condition @xmath153 . in the following ,",
    "we give a detailed calculation of the photon polarization vector in the limit @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "let us calculate @xmath156 and @xmath157 for this region of momenta .",
    "since we are considering the case @xmath158 , the predominant contributions to the integrals in ( [ pizerozero ] ) and ( [ pi ] ) come from the separate regions with @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "both regions give the same contribution since the integrands are unchanged under @xmath161 . taking into account the contribution from both regions we get @xmath162 the angular integration has a collinear divergence that is cutoff by the @xmath163 term neglected in the approximation above and by the mass of the constituents of the plasma ( neglected in our calculation for high @xmath141 ) .",

    "when a heavy meson with a size @xmath2 travels in the quark - gluon plasma , @xmath206 naturally plays the role of the virtuality @xmath207 .",

    "if the successive scatterings between the mesons and the plasma constituents are essentially independent of each other , the criterion @xmath223^{1\\over 3}t}$ ] is also true for the dissociation of heavy mesons almost at rest with the plasma .",
