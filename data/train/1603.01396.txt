    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the universe , hosting hot plasmas with temperatures of @xmath7k as the intracluster medium ( icm ) and dark matters .",
    "the galaxy clusters have evolved primarily via their subcluster mergers , which are the most energetic phenomenon with largest size shock waves after the big bang .",
    "observations show many cases of merging clusters ( e.g. 1e0657 - 56 : @xcite , abell 2256 : @xcite , ciza j2242.8 + 5301 : @xcite ) , and discontinuities in temperature , electron density , or pressure distributions are identified as evidence of shocks in some clusters ( e.g. abell 520 : @xcite , abell 3667 : @xcite ) .    when a shock passes through a plasma , the plasma is heated by the shock efficiently .",
    "the timescale for the thermal equilibration between heated electrons through their coulomb scatterings is expressed as @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) , while that for the collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) is expressed as @xmath9 ( for fe he@xmath0 and fe ly@xmath0 in a plasma with the temperature @xmath10 of several kev ; see also @xcite , @xcite ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the number density and temperature of electrons , respectively .",
    "since @xmath13 is much longer than @xmath14 , the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state can persist for a certain period after the shock passes through the plasma .",
    "although observational evidence of nei plasma is widely confirmed for supernova remnants ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the ionization state of the icm is usually taken to be cie , because @xmath14 and @xmath13 are much shorter than the evolutional timescale of clusters .",
    "there are a few works to examine this assumption ( e.g. @xcite ) , observational evidence of nei plasmas in galaxy clusters has not been found yet .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of merging clusters , the nei state might remain specific regions near shocks where the period after the plasma heating is short .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations of merging clusters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) predict the nei state in some locations in their simulated merging clusters . the n -body / sph simulation carried out by @xcite shows that the line intensity ratio of fe ions , fe ly@xmath0 / fe he@xmath0 , deviates from that in the cie state at the corresponding location of the shock . if we observe an nei plasma with the ionization parameter @xmath15s@xmath2 , we can quantitatively estimate the timescale after the shock heating .",
    "as mentioned above , the ionization state of the icm has been examined in a limited number of papers .",
    "@xcite reported the ionization state of the ophiuchus cluster observed with the suzaku satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ophiuchus cluster is hot and bright enough for us to examine the line ratio of fe ly@xmath0 to fe he@xmath0 in its spatially resolved x - ray spectra .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite concluded that the icm of the ophiuchus cluster reached ionization equilibrium over the whole cluster .",
    "@xcite also examined the fe line ratios in 6 nearby relaxed clusters observed with the xmm - newton epic primarily for a calibration purpose . as a result ,",
    "temperatures derived from fe line ratios were consistent with those estimated from the x - ray continua for all the clusters .",
    "they confirmed not only their calibration accuracy , but also little deviation from the cie state .",
    "the ionization state in the icm has been tested in merging clusters using various plasma emission models ( e.g. abell 2146 : @xcite , ciza j2242.8 + 5301 : @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , only lower limits of ionization parameters were obtained .",
    "they found no significant evidence of nei plasmas even in merging clusters .    in this paper , we search for an nei plasma in the merging galaxy cluster abell 754 using the suzaku data .",
    "deviation from the ionization equilibrium would be key information on the past of the merging process .",
    "we adopt the hubble constant @xmath1670kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "unless otherwise noted , errors correspond to 90% confidence intervals .",
    "abell 754 is a well - studied major merger cluster on the plane of the sky at @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "its surface brightness is elongated along the southeast - northwest direction .",
    "previous works studied its galaxy distribution ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the profile of the radio emission ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the x - ray morphology and the temperature structure in the icm ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these works reveal the followings :    * neither of the two major clumps in the galaxy distribution corresponds to the x - ray brightness peaks . *",
    "spatial variations of the temperature are found with highest temperature @xmath21kev . *",
    "the 1.4 ghz radio diffuse emission consists of two large components ( @xcite ) , roughly correspond to the two large main galaxy concentrations .",
    "these features indicate abell 754 is undergoing a recent major merger .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations carried out by @xcite reproduce the observed x - ray features by considering an off - axis merger between two subclusters with a mass ratio of @xmath22 .",
    "they also imply the merger is a very recent one ( @xmath230.3gyr ) .",
    "@xcite suggests that a more complex picture for the merger in which the third subcluster or a cloud of a cool gas is sloshing independently from its former host subcluster . @xcite",
    "first confirmed the shock front with the mach number of @xmath24 at the southeast part of the cluster by measuring the temperature jump with chandra .",
    "they also noticed the edge of one radio emission coincide with this temperature jump . in this paper , we call this  shock - se  .",
    "shock - se supports the idea that the merger takes place along the southeast and northwest axis , although parameters for the merger are loosely constrained .",
    "besides , using the bepposax data , @xcite reported the @xmath25 detection of a hard x - ray excess above @xmath26kev .",
    "they discuss two possibilities of this excess : the emission from the bl lac object , 26w20 , in the field of view of bepposax , or the inverse compton emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "the suzaku observation of abell 754 was performed with an effective exposure of 109ks from 2007 may 29 to 2007 june 1 .",
    "suzaku has four x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) cameras .",
    "three of the xis ( xis0 , 2 , 3 ) and the other ( xis1 ) employ front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd , respectively .",
    "since xis2 has been out of function from 2006 november 9 , we use the other three xis ( i.e. xis0 , 1 , 3 ) .",
    "the observation was performed with either the normal @xmath27 or @xmath28 mode , and we combined these data in our analysis .",

    "the nxb was subtracted from the x - ray spectra , while we include the x - ray background in the spectral fitting model .",

    "we extract the x - ray spectrum from each region . in this analysis",
    ", we find bright point sources neither in the suzaku nor xmm - newton image ( @xcite ) .",
    "we employ xspec ver.12.8.2n to perform spectral fitting .",
    "x - ray spectra in the 210kev and in the 28kev bands are used for the fi ccds and bi ccd , respectively .",
    "the fi spectra added together . since @xcite reported that the systematic deviation of the energy scales between the fi and bi ccds is only 0.09% , we fit fi and bi spectra with the same model parameters .",
    "each spectral bin has a minimum count of twenty . in these energy bands ,",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) is the only x - ray background component we should consider .",

    "proper auxiliary response files ( arf ) are prepared using _",
    "xissimarfgen _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "in order to estimate the photons from the outer part of the suzaku field of view , we define reg0 at the southeastern side of reg1 ( figure [ fig : a754image ] ) . on the other hand , contamination to reg6 from its northwest adjacent region is neglected .",
    "we input the xmm - newton images ( 0.212kev ) of reg03 and the suzaku images ( 15kev ) of reg46 , as the photon distributions needed for",
    "_ xissimarfgen_.    first the spectra extracted from each region ( reg16 ) are fitted simultaneously , employing the nei models for the icm component . in the fitting , the normalization ratio between the emission model of reg0 and that of reg1 is fixed at the ratio of the count rates between them estimated by the xmm - newton data .",
    "other parameters of the reg0 model are linked to those of the reg1 model .",
    "the comparison with the x - ray image and the numerical simulation suggests that abell754 is a merger on the plane of the sky ( @xcite ) .",

    "we first examine the line intensity ratio of fe ly@xmath0 to fe he@xmath0 for the six regions .",
    "the icm component is empirically modeled with a bremsstrahlung continuum and two gaussian lines . the cxb component and the contamination from adjacent regions",
    "are considered as noted in section [ subsec : photon_contamination ] .",
    "figure [ fig : lineratio ] shows the fe ly@xmath0 / fe he@xmath0 line intensity ratio and the electron temperature of each region .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of reg6 does not have enough statistics to constrain the line intensity ratio , and thus is not included in the plot .",
    "respective blue and magenta curves indicate the line intensity ratio of fe ly@xmath0 / fe he@xmath0 expected from the cie model and that of the nei model with @xmath33s@xmath2 .",
    "we note that the line ratio in reg5 shows a hint of nei plasma , while the line ratio is almost consistent with that in the cie state for other regions .",
    "we also note that the value of the fe line ratio in reg2 is significantly larger than the cie model , which might imply an over - ionizing plasma .",
    "we next perform individual spectral fitting by employing the xspec plasma code , nei models for the icm component .",
    "the redshift is fixed at the value ( @xmath34 ) determined in the simultaneous fit described in section [ subsec : photon_contamination ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that the temperature in the outer ( pre - shock ) region is about 5kev ( see region 12 in @xcite and figure 3 in @xcite ) .",

    "hence , we also fit the spectra of reg5 and reg6 simultaneously by setting the parameters of each emission model free , while the component of photon contamination from reg4 to reg5 are fixed . even in this fitting the ionization parameters are constrained as shown in table [ tab : neifit_reg5_reg6 ] , indicationg the nei state .    in the individual fitting of reg5",
    ", we obtain the relatively low abundance comparing to reg4 ( table [ tab : neifit_indi ] ) . for reference",
    ", we perform the spectral fitting of reg5 by fixing the abundance to the 90% upper limits of abundance in reg5 , @xmath35 solar . in this case , the only lower limit of the ionization parameter is constrained ( @xmath36s@xmath2 ) . in these",
    "fitting , we fix the redshift to the value determined in the simultaneous fitting for 6 regions .",
    "if we set the redshift to be free for reg5 , the fitting result is @xmath37 and @xmath38s@xmath2 .",
    "although this value of @xmath29 is consistent with the cie , the redshifts of 0.062 is different from that for the common 6 regions by about 3000km / s .",
    "this difference is too large for the cluster merging in the plane of the sky .",
    "we plot spatial distributions of the icm plasma parameters determined in section [ subsec : neifit ] and figure [ fig : spatial_distribution ] .",

    "the right panel of figure [ fig : spatial_distribution ] shows the ionization parameters for each region . only in reg5 ,",
    "the upper bound of the ionization parameter is smaller than the cie value ( green line ) .",
    "we next calculate the electron density of the icm from the best fit values of the normalization in the nei model . for this calculation , a three dimensional profile model of the icm density",
    "is needed .",
    "this is not trivial , especially for merging clusters with complicated morphology as in our case .",
    "figure [ fig : projected_surface_brightness ] shows the background - subtracted one - dimensional surface brightness map of reg6 projected to the direction perpendicular to the red axis in figure [ fig : a754image ] . for each of six region ( reg16 ) , the surface brightness map is well - fitted by a gaussian model .",
    "we assume that the icm profile of abell 754 can be approximated with a group of cylinders with different radii and axes as shown in figure [ fig : geometry ] and each cylinder has a uniform density .",
    "the radius of each cylinder @xmath39 is calculated as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the standard deviation of the gaussian model fit for the surface brightness , if we approximate the gaussian profile with the hemisphere profile of the same variance .",
    "the best fit values of the radii and the volume of the cylinders are summarized in table [ tab : fit_result_cylinder ] .",
    "the electron densities evaluated by using these cylindrical geometries are shown by red points in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : spatial_distribution ] and in `` cylindrical assumption '' row of table [ tab : electron_density ] .",

    "figure [ fig : beta_fit ] shows the radial surface brightness map from the central position of reg4 toward reg6 with the best fit @xmath43-model of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with those of a large sample of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . using this @xmath43-model , we average the electron density for each region within a radius of @xmath46 .",
    "the blue points in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : spatial_distribution ] and `` spherical assumption '' row in table [ tab : electron_density ] show the electron density estimated by the best fit @xmath43-model .",
    "the difference is only a factor of 1.01.2 between the electron densities under the spherical assumption and those under the cylindrical assumption . in the following discussion ,",
    "we apply the values evaluated by the cylindrical assumption .",
    "we find an nei plasma at reg5 in section [ subsec : neifit ] .",
    "nevertheless , this result might depend on the icm emission model employed .",
    "although we assumed a single temperature nei model in section [ subsec : neifit ] , a two - temperature cie plasma model might be another possibility .",
    "we then fit the x - ray spectrum of reg5 with a combination of two cie models for the icm component .",

    "the spectrum of reg5 is well fitted with this two - temperature cie model .",
    "note , however , that the very high temperature ( @xmath6kev ) component can be also fitted with a powerlaw model .      as mentioned in section [ sec : abell754 ] , abell 754 hosts a radio halo extended over almost its whole region ( @xcite ) .",
    "it means there exist high - energy electrons , which can reproduce a non - thermal hard x - ray emission via an inverse compton process .",
    "the hxd on suzaku , which simultaneously observes the same source as the xis , is useful to study this component .",
    "the dead - time corrected raw hxd count rate in 1540kev energy band is @xmath47countss@xmath17 , where the 1 @xmath48 statistical error is shown , while the nxb and the cxb modeled count rate are @xmath49countss@xmath17 and @xmath50countss@xmath17 ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the net count rate in which the nxb and the cxb are subtracted is @xmath51countss@xmath17 , corresponding to 14.3% of nxb .",
    "this is significantly larger than systematic errors in the nxb model ( @xcite ) , indicating that abell 754 is positively detected with the hxd .",
    "our next concern is whether this hard x - ray emission can be reproduced only with an extension of the thermal components observed with the xis or an extra non - thermal component is required .",
    "we consider a spectral model consisting of the cxb and seven thermal components ( reg06 ) determined with the xis spectra as described in section [ subsec : neifit ] .",
    "the parameters of all the thermal components and those of cxb are fixed to the values shown in table [ tab : neifit_indi ] and the values reported by @xcite , respectively , allowing only one free parameter to tune the entire normalization between the hxd and the xis .",
    "we prepare the hxd arfs for each spatial region by using _",
    "hxdarfgen _ and apply them to the corresponding thermal component .",
    "figure [ fig : hxdspectrum ] shows the fitting result in the 1030kev band .",
    "the best fit values of the normalization factor for the hxd is @xmath52 ( @xmath53/d.o.f.@xmath54 ) .",
    "according to the suzaku memo , the systematic difference between the hxd and the xis is @xmath55 , which is the expected value of the normalization factor we introduced in the fitting .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the nxb model of @xmath56% ( @xcite ) yields systematic error of 0.2 for the normalization .",
    "the difference between observed and expected values for the normalization is smaller than this value .",
    "we thus conclude that the hxd spectrum is reproduced only with the thermal components we modeled for the xis spectra .",
    "the hard x - ray excess ( @xmath57kev ) such as reported by @xcite is not needed to reproduce the hxd spectrum in the 1030kev band .",
    "we also note that the counting statistic of our hxd data does not allow us to distinguish two possibilities , i.e. , the single temperature nei model or the two - temperature cie model wit respective to reg5 .",
    "we have performed the spectral analysis of abell 754 with the nei plasma model .",
    "the spatial distribution of the electron density shows two peaks at reg1 and reg4 .",
    "the peak at reg1 corresponds to the main cluster , while that at reg4 does the subcluster , both of which are merging .",
    "this is consistent with the previous view suggested by the xmm - newton observation of this cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature distribution of abell 754 shows a gradient along the merging direction and takes its highest value of @xmath58kev at reg5 .",
    "the main finding of this paper is the nei plasma at reg5 .",
    "this is suggested both from the line intensity ratio between fe he@xmath0 and fe ly@xmath0 in the empirical model fitting and from the ionization parameter @xmath29 derived in the single temperature nei plasma model fitting .",
    "we , however , can not rule out the possibility that the icm component in reg5 consists of two cie components with different temperatures .",
    "if the single temperature nei model is adopted , we are able to discuss past history of the plasma in reg5 quantitatively as we expected . with the ionization parameters we obtained ( @xmath4s@xmath2 ) and the electron density we evaluated ( @xmath59@xmath2 ) , the timescale after the plasma heating is obtained to be 0.3676 myr at the 90% confidence level .",
    "this is rather short comparing with the evolutional timescale of clusters .",
    "however , if there is another shock wave at the boundary between reg5 and reg6 ( we call it  shock - nw  ) , in addition to shock - se identified by @xcite near reg0 , this timescale is consistent with the time after the shock passage .",
    "although the errors in the temperatures derived in the fit and the spatial resolution of suzaku are not small enough to constrain , a possible temperature jump from 14kev at reg5 to 10kev at reg6 is not ruled out .",
    "if there is the temperature jump , we can apply the rankine - hugoniot condition with an adiabatic index @xmath60 .",
    "this temperature jump corresponds to the shock with the mach number relative to the pre - shock region @xmath61 and that relevant to the post - shock region @xmath62 .",
    "since the post - shock velocity is  1300km / s , the timescale that shock - nw passes through the half of reg5 is @xmath6369 myr , consistent with the timescale we derived from the ionization parameter .    in the spectral analysis with plasma models",
    ", we have roughly assumed the initial temperature is 5kev .",
    "initial temperatures slightly alter the ionization timescale .",
    "we fit the spectra using the plasma model with different initial temperatures , 0.1 , 1 , 7kev . as shown in table [",
    "tab : fit_result_ktinit ] , the timescales in almost cases are consistent with that for shock - nw passing through the region .",
    "the temperature jump between reg5 and reg6 is just our speculation , and we have to wait future observations .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite suggested a coincidence between the edge of the radio emission and shock - se they identified with the chandra data near reg0 .",
    "we notice that the other edge of the radio emission roughly corresponds to shock - nw , indirectly supporting our hypothesis .",
    "we also notice a hint of over - ionized plasma at reg2 in figure [ fig : lineratio ] . applying an over - ionized plasma model with an initial temperature of @xmath64kev to the icm component of this spectrum",
    ", we obtain the relaxation timescale of @xmath65s@xmath2 .",
    "while it is difficult to explain a mechanism to make an over - ionized plasma in the icm , we notice that the simulation of merging clusters by @xcite shows specific regions where the fe line ratio is consistent with the over - ionized plasma ( see figure 6 supplied by @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is more prominent in the case of the collision between clusters with different masses .",
    "the possibility of an over - ionized plasma in the icm is an issue for future study .",
    "go back to the icm model at reg5 , another interpretation is a two - temperature cie component .",
    "the best fit values of the temperatures are @xmath66kev and @xmath67kev .",
    "although the averaged temperature of entire abell 754 is @xmath68kev , we can not deny the possibility that the cool component is a remnant of a cool core before merging .",
    "in fact , setting the initial condition of the temperatures to @xmath69kev and @xmath70kev , @xcite well reproduced the temperature map of abell 754 by numerical simulation .",
    "the component of the very high temperature suggests there may be extremely hot region at reg5 which is strongly heated by a merger ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such high temperature component is also approximated with a powerlaw model as reported by @xcite , although it is not detected significantly in the hxd spectrum in the 1030kev energy band ( section [ subsec : hxdfit ] ) .",
    "the hard x - ray imaging performed by nustar ( @xcite ) or hard x - ray imager installed on astro - h ( @xcite ) will help us to distinguish these hypotheses .",
    "whichever interpretation , the single temperature nei or the two temperature cie , is correct , we consider the merging process cause a deviation from the single temperature cie model at reg5 .",
    "discrimination of these two with future observations must be important to understand the merging history and physics in this cluster , and clusters in general .",
    "we performed the x - ray spectral analysis of abell 754 observed with suzaku . assuming a single temperature plasma model at each region , we measured the spatial distributions of plasma parameters along the merger axis .",
    "the temperature increases from southeast to northwest and highest at reg5 ( @xmath71kev ) .",
    "the ionization parameter deviates from its equilibrium value only at reg5 ( @xmath4s@xmath2 ) , suggesting the nei plasma at that region .",
    "the timescale after the plasma heating in this region is estimated from the ionization parameter , and is 0.3676 myr at the 90% confidence level .",
    "this timescale is rather short but consistent with the time after the shock passage , if we assume the shock front at the boundary of reg5 and reg6 ( shock - nw ) . on the other hand , another possibility in which the icm at reg5 consists of two - temperature cie plasma",
    "is not ruled out . even in that case",
    ", we suspect the very high ( @xmath72kev ) temperature component , which might also be a non - thermal component , is due to merging process in this cluster .",

    "<S> abell 754 is a galaxy cluster in which an ongoing merger is evident on the plane of the sky , from the southeast to the northwest . </S>",
    "<S> we study the spatial variation of the x - ray spectra observed with suzaku along the merging direction , centering on the fe ly@xmath0 / fe he@xmath0 line ratio to search for possible deviation from ionization equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> fitting with a single temperature collisional non - equilibrium plasma model shows that the electron temperature increases from the southeast to the northwest . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization parameter is consistent with that in equilibrium ( @xmath1s@xmath2 ) except for a specific region with the highest temperature ( @xmath3kev ) where @xmath4s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the elapsed time from the plasma heating estimated from the ionization parameter is 0.3676 myr at the 90% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> this time scale is quite short but consistent with the traveling time of a shock to pass through that region . </S>",
    "<S> we thus interpret that the non - equilibrium ionization plasma in abell 754 observed is a remnant of the shock heating in the merger process . </S>",
    "<S> we , however , note that the x - ray spectrum of the specific region where the non - equilibrium is found can also be fitted with a collisional ionization plasma model with two temperatures , low @xmath5kev and very high @xmath6kev . </S>",
    "<S> the very high temperature component is alternatively fitted with a power law model . </S>",
    "<S> either of these spectral models is interpreted as a consequence of the ongoing merger process as in the case of that with the non - equilibrium ionization plasma . </S>"
