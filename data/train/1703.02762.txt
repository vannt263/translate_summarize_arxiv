    "chiral symmetry plays an important role not only in hadron masses but also in decay properties and inter - hadron interactions in vacuum . recently , to investigate the hadrons at finite density and/or temperature is an important subject , because the broken chiral symmetry can be restored partially . in this case , the linear representation is adopted , where the hadron fields are given by the irreducible representations of @xmath4 .",
    "the first example is the linear sigma model by gell - mann and levy  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon field is transformed linearly in the chiral group of @xmath5 .",
    "the linear representation scheme is considered in the chiral doublet nucleons including the positive - parity state ( ground state ) and the negative - parity state ( excited state )  @xcite , and is applied to investigate the properties of excited baryons  @xcite . some studies on scalar mode ( @xmath6 ) and pseudo - scalar mode ( @xmath7 ) within the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model at density and/or temperature",
    "also exists ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "the finite mass splitting between two states in a chiral partner is the sufficient condition for the chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum .",
    "therefore , to investigate the properties of chiral doublet provides us with useful information about the origin of hadron mass  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and references therein ) . however , the representation of the chiral group for baryons is complex , because they are composed at least of three quarks , @xmath8 . in this respect ,",
    "heavy - light mesons , whose quark content is @xmath9 , are simpler objects , because the heavy quark is irrelevant to the chiral dynamics and the light quark component belongs to the fundamental representation of the chiral group . in the present work ,",
    "therefore , we consider heavy - light mesons as probes to explore the chiral symmetry in nuclear matter .",
    "a heavy - light meson such as a @xmath0 meson , which is composed of an anti - charm quark and a light quark , can be a good probe to investigate the chiral symmetry at finite density .",
    "thanks to the heavy mass of the anti - charm quark , the meson mass is much larger than the low energy scale of qcd , @xmath10 a few hundred mev .",
    "it allows us to employ a scheme of @xmath11 expansion with @xmath12 being the heavy quark mass , and to utilize the heavy quark spin symmetry in which the light quark spin and the heavy quark spin are almost independently conserved quantities  @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark symmetry is important not only in vacuum but also in nuclear matter , because it induces the channel coupling effect between a @xmath0 meson and a @xmath13 meson in interaction process with a nucleon  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the light quark component in a @xmath0 meson shares the same light ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) quark with a nucleon through the quark exchange , and can strongly interact with nuclear matter .",
    "hence , the interaction between a @xmath0 meson and a nucleon will be supplied mainly by the light quark dynamics , where chiral symmetry should play the significant role .",
    "this is the reason why we focus on the heavy - light meson in nuclear matter .",
    "importantly , @xmath0 mesons do not contain a light antiquark so that there is no need to take into account pair annihilations of a light quark @xmath16 and a light antiquark @xmath17 .",
    "this is sharply in contrast to the case of a @xmath18 meson with the quark content @xmath19 , where the annihilation by @xmath20 and several coupled - channel processes ( e.g. @xmath21 ) , in which the interaction process is much complex , may provide non - negligible contributions .",
    "thanks to these advantages , we can extract the informations of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter in a relatively easy way . the experiment of heavy - light mesons at density can be performed at j - parc and fair , and so on .",
    "several studies on heavy - light mesons at finite temperature and/or density are found in the literatures  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and references therein ) . especially in relation to chiral symmetry , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the masses of @xmath0 mesons in a dense matter such as the skyrmion crystal was studied by including both chiral partner structure and heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "the chiral partners such as a @xmath0 meson @xmath22 and a @xmath2 meson @xmath23 , whose parities are opposite each other , have unequal masses whose difference stems from the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry  @xcite . hence , the two masses of chiral partners should be degenerate in the chiral symmetric phase .",
    "in fact , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that their masses are degenerate at certain high density ; the @xmath0 meson mass increases , while the @xmath2 meson mass decreases , and eventually their masses become the value which is given by the averaged mass of chiral partners in the vacuum .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , only @xmath24 type mean field were included . later in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath25 type mean field were also considered in addition , and it was found that the @xmath25 mean field affects the masses of a @xmath18 meson and a @xmath0 meson in opposite way , while the @xmath25 mean field affects the masses of the chiral partner , a @xmath0 meson and a @xmath26 meson , in the same way .",
    "we notice , however , that the degenerate masses of chiral partners can differ from the chiral invariant mass whose value is defined by the averaged mass of chiral partners in vacuum .",
    "we also note that , in the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , only the mean fields of a @xmath24 meson and a @xmath25 meson are taken into account , and the loop corrections from fluctuations were neglected .",
    "the purpose in this paper is that , based on the linear sigma model , we include , not only the mean field of a @xmath24 meson , but also loop effects perturbatively beyond the mean field level , and study the masses and the spectral functions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons in nuclear matter . in our calculation , the medium effects at one - loop order are mainly induced by a virtual pion and a virtual @xmath24 meson , whose contributions are given by the mediated diagrams .",
    "we present that the loop corrections to the mean field of a @xmath24 meson are important for the modifications of @xmath0 and @xmath2 meson masses .",
    "there are also the other diagrams which give the imaginary parts in self - energies @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "we will present thus that the loop corrections play the significant roles for the spectral functions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons in nuclear matter .",
    "the corresponding diagrams will be given concretely in the main text . in the following ,",
    "we refer `` @xmath0 mesons '' as @xmath0 @xmath22 , @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath2 @xmath23 and @xmath29 @xmath30 mesons for short notations , but this will not cause any confusions .",

    "<S> we investigate the in - medium masses of a @xmath0 @xmath1 meson and a @xmath2 @xmath3 meson and spectral functions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 meson channels in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> these mesons are introduced as chiral partner in the chiral symmetry broken vacuum , hence they are useful to explore the partial restoration of the broken chiral symmetry in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the linear sigma model to describe the chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the loop corrections to @xmath0 and @xmath2 meson masses provide a smaller mass splitting at finite density than that in vacuum , whose result indicates a tendency of the restoration of the chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate also the spectral function for @xmath2 meson channel , and find three peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the first peak which corresponds to the resonance of @xmath2 meson is broadened by collisions with nucleons in medium , and the peak position shifts to lower mass due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry as the density increases . </S>",
    "<S> the second peak is identified as a threshold enhancement which shows a remarkable enhancement as the density increase . </S>",
    "<S> the third peak is landau damping . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained properties of @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons in nuclear matter will provide useful information for experiments . </S>"
