    "the discovery of the temperature - driven isostructural transition between ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases in chemically ordered ( b2-phase , cscl structure ) equiatomic ferh alloys nearly eight decades ago @xcite posed a wide range of intriguing fundamental problems and paved the way to possible applications .",
    "these comprise electric field control of magnetic order,@xcite heat assisted magnetic recording devices @xcite or a room temperature af memory resistor .",
    "@xcite ferh has also served as a model system for the investigation of magnetization reversal processes .",
    "@xcite last but not least , because of the large entropy change at the af - fm transition , ferh can be considered as one of the best magnetocaloric materials .",
    "@xcite here we show that modifying this , already outstanding , material by applying expitaxial strain to a chemically _ disordered _ metastable phase leads to a hitherto unreported magnetostructural instability in equiatomic ferh .",
    "strain - control of material properties in general is a well - established concept in modern functional materials design .",
    "epitaxial thin films can be considered as a special , technologically relevant , case . here",
    "the functional material is coherently grown onto a substrate and strain is applied by the mismatch between the two crystal lattices .",
    "to achieve extraordinarily strained films , it has been suggested to use soft materials @xcite possessing inherent lattice instabilities , e.g materials undergoing martensitic transformations .",
    "@xcite such experiments have been reported in epitaxially strained thin films of disordered fepd and fepdcu magnetic shape memory alloys ( msma ) .",
    "@xcite an alternative strategy for controlling the strain state in msma thin films is to use ion - irradiation to create point defects which generate local stress fields in the material .",
    "@xcite    concerning epitaxial b2-ferh thin films a distinct strain dependence of the af - fm transition temperature has been shown by several authors .",
    "@xcite in contrast , little is known about strain effects in the disordered alloys , where a significant impact of interatomic distances @xcite ( i.e. strain ) and chemical disorder @xcite on the magnetic properties has been recently suggested by theory .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", the occurrence of martensitic lattice instabilities in the fe - rh system would be a crucial factor allowing for the growth of highly strained epitaxial films .",
    "indeed , such instabilities have been reported in b2-ordered equiatomic alloys induced by deformation @xcite or pd - substitution @xcite and in disordered fe - rich ( 20 - 25at% rh ) alloys . here , a transition from the face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) a1 phase to the body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) a2 phase was observed after quenching .",
    "@xcite    the disordered bcc - a2 phase is suppressed in alloys with larger rh content , due to the strong b2-ordering.@xcite a thermodynamic analysis based on experimental data of different compositions and degree of order predicts a fm state with an estimated curie temperature ( @xmath0 ) of 800k and @xmath14@xmath2 per unit cell for a2-ferh .",
    "@xcite the long - range magnetic order of a2-ferh arises from the dominating short - range fm exchange interactions between fe - fe and fe - rh pairs over competing af fe - fe interactions at larger separations @xcite in turn , the net spin - polarization of the rh orbitals is stabilized through the hybridization with the fm ordered fe .",
    "@xcite    in the present study , we demonstrate that by carefully choosing the growth conditions an epitaxial strain - induced , adaptive martensite structure can be obtained in equiatomic , disordered ferh thin films on w(001 ) ( + 6% epitaxial mismatch ) .",
    "the initial lowering of symmetry ( from cubic to tetragonal ) induces a martensitic lattice instability which reduces the symmetry further towards a final orthorhombic structure , that grows with an adaptive nano - twinned martensite structure . by taking advantage of the strong dependence of both the spin - polarization of the rh orbitals and the fe - fe magnetic exchange parameters on the local structure ,",
    "we effectively modify the balance between fm order and magnetic frustration and possibly achieve complete dynamic spin disorder at low temperatures .",

    "is accompanied by a gain in band energy , which arises from the redistribution of a peak in the rh partial dos just below @xmath74 ( features marked by arrows in both magnetic configurations in fig .",

    "this reminds of a band - jahn - teller - like mechanism , which is known from other ferrous alloys , such as fe - pd.@xcite    the combination of a specific shuffling of atomic planes with the disappearance of a peak - like structure in the minority spin dos is reminiscent of the fermi surface nesting which results in a soft phonon mode via electron - phonon coupling .",

    "particular cross - sections of the minority spin - channel of the bloch spectral function @xmath76 in fm ferh ( fig .  [ figure11 ] ) suggest the suppression of marked parallel features by the distortion ( a similar situation is also encountered in the pm case@xcite ) .",
    "this may be counted as a first indication of nesting - induced electron - phonon coupling .",
    "however , to obtain a complete picture one must evaluate the entire four - dimensional object @xmath76 in terms of the generalized susceptibility and investigate the phonon dispersion of this disordered system , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in conclusion , chemically disordered ferh was deposited epitaxially on w(001 ) .",
    "a combined experimental and theoretical study indicates that the strain , imposed on the system via the epitaxial growth , triggers a martensitic transformation into an orthorhombic adaptive martensite .",
    "the structural changes then lead to the total breakdown of magnetic order . based on the results of our electronic structure calculations and the absence of any stable magnetic order , observed experimentally by cems and squid magnetometry , we propose , that the system is characterized by dynamically fluctuating disorder in the localized @xmath71 according to frustrated magnetic exchange couplings .",
    "the frustrated magnetic exchange interactions are a direct consequence of our epitaxial - strain tailoring of the martensitic instability .",
    "the huge sensitivity of magnetic order to rather moderate structural changes , carefully tailored by epitaxial strain , makes disordered ferh particularly interesting for magnetostrictive or magnetoresistive sensor or actuator applications,@xcite alongside its well - investigated b2-ordered counterpart .",
    "the close resemblance to band - jahn - teller - type instabilities in msmas indicates that this might be a rather general feature of transition metal alloys with both , localized @xmath19-moment and hybridization - induced magnetic moments , accompanied by a marked feature in the dos .",
    "thus , it should be observed in a variety of other systems , which can be conveniently preselected employing electronic structure calculations , by tuning the electronic features around the fermi surface with external stimuli such as epitaxial strain .",
    "amplification of a symmetry breaking by an external symmetry - lowering stimulus may be considered as a rather general and innovative tailoring strategy for specific functional properties . an analogous case was found in thin films of multiferroic bifeo@xmath77 , where the large epitaxial strains result in the formation of reduced symmetry structures,@xcite which might be linked to a phonon softening .",
