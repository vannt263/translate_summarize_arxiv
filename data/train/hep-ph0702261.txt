    "the @xmath6 gauge theory is a very attractive candidate of the grand unification .",

    "consequently , by adding three right - handed neutrinos , we can obtain a economic picture of matter in the universe .",
    "unfortunately , however , the gut scale physics is often highly surpressed .",
    "then we focus on the left - right symmetric extension of the standard model ( sm ) as the low - energy effective theory of the @xmath6 theory .",
    "the left - right symmetric model ( lr ) @xcite is one of the oldest extension of particle physics . since the lr model , like the @xmath6",
    ", naturally introduce right - handed neutrinos , and then it harmonize well with the recent evidences of the nonzero neutrino masses . generally , this model requires the @xmath16 triplet scalars in order to reproduce the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "these triplets could become a smoking - gun evidence of the lr model .",
    "the lr models in the literature have more free parameters and must be less predictive .",
    "we can obtain more restrictive scenarios by considering the lr with the @xmath0-parity and the grand unification .    in order to approach the ultra high energy scale , we consider baryogenesis via leptogenesis in the universe @xcite .",
    "the wmap collaboration showed the baryon - to - photon number ratio with high precision @xcite : @xmath17 also second determination of @xmath18 can be obtained from nucleosynthesis , i.e. abundances of the light elements , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23 the full @xmath6 gut framework has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "we analyze whether the observed values of @xmath24 can be reproduced in order to investigate our restrictive and minimal lr model .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ modeldescription ] , we briey review the lr extended model and setup our model . as remarked above , in order to make our model more restrictive and predictive , we impose the d - parity restoration and the some grand unication like @xmath6 . here",

    "[ numericalansatz ] ) and the unification of the known quark and lepton fields ( sec .",

    "keep in mind that this gut condition does not necessarily imply the @xmath6 gut .",
    "there we show that a hierarchical structure of the gut scale and the @xmath0-parity restoration scale is essential .",

    "and the numbers in the brakets denotes the ps quantum numbers . in order to obtain more predictive models we take the michel s conjecture into consideration . generally in @xmath6 grand unification ,",
    "quarks and leptons are asigned into three @xmath44-dimensional spinor representations as listed in eq .  . and the gauge fields are in a @xmath45-dimensional adjoint representation .",
    "it should be noted that the ps - singlet in @xmath26 is axial under the @xmath46-parity , howver , the one in @xmath32 is not .",
    "this difference occupies an important place in our model building . furthermore , since first candidate have the least breaking steps , it would be expected to be the most constrained case .",
    "then we consider the minimal lr model and use the gut realization as a boundary condition at higher energy scale . as a result",
    ", we find that it is sure as expected .",
    "we show the details in the next subsection .      at first , we show all required scalar representations underlined in the above : @xmath47 here we showed the @xmath39 quantum numbers .",

    "we see that eq .   and are not symmetric in spite of the left - right symmetric framework .",
    "this results from the fact that the scalar @xmath63 is an axial under the @xmath46-parity .",
    "we ontain two important indications from these relations .",
    "first , according to eq .",
    ", the hugeness of the @xmath46-parity breaking scale @xmath62 results in the smallness of the vev of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we numerically check this fact later .",
    "second , let us consider eq .   and .",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are at the same order , they are canceled each other and then we have @xmath67 .",
    "if such is the case , the squared mass of @xmath4 would be given by @xmath68 .",
    "hence it would be possible that the left - handed triplet @xmath4 is much lighter than the right - handed one @xmath69 : @xmath70 below we take this possibility into account .    since it is absolutely imperative for leptogenesis to generate the lepton asymmetry , we are interested in when the @xmath71 symmetry broke down . for this end",
    "we solve the two - loop renormalization equations for the gauge couplings . as remarked before , in order to obtain more restrictive models we impose two boundary conditions .",
    "first boundary condition is the restoration of the @xmath46-parity .",
    "this means that above a high energy scale the @xmath37 gauge coupling evolves along with the @xmath3 one .",
    "second boundary condition is the grand unification , which is essential to refer to @xmath72 gauge groups .",
    "this constraint suggests that the hypercharge and @xmath73 charge are normalized as follows : @xmath74 and then at the gut scale , we have @xmath75 before showing the results , let us refer the numbers of the free input parameters . in this renormalization group analysis",
    ", we have four input parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath78 denotes the mass of the second doublet higgs , and the mixing angle @xmath77 is defined by @xcite @xmath80 we assume that @xmath69 lives in the same energy scale as @xmath81 , and then we do not treat @xmath82 as a free input parameter . at this stage",
    "the high - precision measurement of @xmath83 helps us a lot .",
    "since the current observation error of the electroweak gauge coupling is very small , the allowed range of the mixing angle @xmath77 of the neutral @xmath37 boson @xmath84 and @xmath85 boson @xmath86 is extremely - narrow .",
    "consequently , we can virtually determine @xmath87 uniquely , and then we can obtain a strong constraint on the @xmath88 boson mass .",
    "in contrast with the usual left - right symmetric models , the consequence of this argument is that a set of three parameters @xmath89 tells us unique values of the @xmath90 breaking scale @xmath91 , the @xmath46-parity scale @xmath62 and the gut scale @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath91 can be calculated from @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 through the newton  raphson - like method .",

    "the former comes from eq .",

    "then , note that the experimentally detected doubly - charged higgs boson @xmath97 can be identified as pure @xmath98 .",
    "the dilepton detection puts the limits of the mass of a doubly - charged higgs boson @xmath97 .",
    "the decay modes of @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 bring the results of @xmath102 [ gev ] respectively .",
