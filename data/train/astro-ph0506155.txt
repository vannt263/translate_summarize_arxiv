    "in addition , it has been proposed that the fe line observed in some grb x - ray afterglows could be attributed to a prolonged activity of the central engine ( rees & mszros 2000 ; gao & wei 2005 ) .    a possible mechanism for the re - activity of the central engine could be as follows . during the accretion phase which powers the prompt @xmath0ray emission ,",
    "a fraction of the material constituting the massive progenitor could possibly be pulled out ; the central engine could thus be restarted at late times by the fall back of part of this material onto the central collapsar remnant ( king et al . 2005 ) .    here",
    "we assume that the central engine restarts a few minutes after the prompt @xmath0ray emission , powering a new unsteady relativistic outflow .",
