    "the radiative return method proposed for the first time to serve as a tool in the hadronic cross section measurement @xcite requires monte carlo event generator(s ) as theoretical input .",
    "the method relies on the factorization properties of the differential cross section with photon(s ) emitted from the initial states ( isr ) and the possibility to solve problems caused by the photons emitted from the final hadrons ( fsr ) .",
    "the first tools to meet the expectations from experimental groups were developed ( eva @xcite , eva4pi @xcite ) using the structure functions method .",
    "that was a limitation , as not only the accuracy of the codes was not adequate to fulfill the experimental expectations , but also within that framework more theoretical work is required to deal with possible double counting of the configurations , where the hard photon is emitted at low angles .",
    "the adopted approach in the continuation of the research program , mainly fixed order exact calculations , resulted in the development of the state - of - the - art monte carlo event generator phokhara@xcite , successfully used by the experimental groups babar , belle and kloe working at meson factories .",
    "the hadronic cross section extracted using the radiative return method from the cross section of the reaction with emitted photons gives complementary information to the scan method , traditionally used for such purposes .",
    "it is needed to calculate , via dispersion relations , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) and the running of the electromagnetic coupling ( for recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "profiting from the huge luminosities of the meson factories one can get valuable physical information , without building new accelerators and with accuracy competitive to traditional methods , as demonstrated @xcite by the kloe collaboration . as the method allows for the extraction of the hadronic cross section for energies from a production threshold to ( almost ) the nominal energy of the experiment , the b - factories have an access to data in the energy regions not covered previously by other experiments .",
    "already now many new results exist , replacing the old measurements and/or covering new energy regions , crucial for a precise evaluation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the method originally developed for the hadronic cross section measurement has , however , broader applications and can be used to study the hadron dynamics .",
    "work started in this direction in @xcite , where it was shown how to extract nucleon form factors .",
    "it was continued in @xcite , where a method to test various models of the radiative @xmath2 decays was proposed .",
    "working along this line , a newly published analysis @xcite shows how to use spin information on the decaying baryons to measure phase differences of their form factors .",
    "the monte carlo event generator phokhara 6.0 was tested intensively at each stage of its development and the proved technical precision of the code is at the level of a small fraction ( 0.1 - 0.2 ) of a per mill .",
    "the precision of the theoretical formulae used in the code is currently about 0.5% as far as the isr is concerned .",
    "that accuracy is however not good enough to fully profit from more then 2 fb@xmath3 data collected by kloe @xcite at daphne and further work is required to meet the growing expectations .",
    "the paper starts with a short description of the radiative return method in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "the present status of the physics program for the precision hadronic physics with the phokhara monte carlo generator is outlined in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "a short summary is presented in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the radiative return method relies on factorization properties of the cross section with photon emitted from the initial electron or positron @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the invariant mass of the hadrons .",
    "a similar factorization holds also , when more than one photon is emitted from initial states .",
    "the function @xmath6 ( or a more complicated function for multi - photon emission ) , at relatively low energies of meson factories , is given with high accuracy by qed only and is thus well known . from this",
    "follows that a measurement of the differential ( in @xmath5 ) cross section of the reaction @xmath7 allows for a cross section @xmath8 extraction for energies from the production threshold to almost the nominal energy of a given experiment .",
    "the presence of the contributions from photon(s ) emitted from final hadrons has to be treated as a background .",
    "it has to be studied carefully as the models of photon emission from hadrons are not well established .",
    "the region of the hadron invariant masses , which is of main interest , is below 3 gev and thus the role of the fsr at the @xmath2 factory daphne is far more important then at b- factories ( belle and babar ) .",
    "the reason is purely kinematical . to obtain a low invariant mass of the hadronic system one needs a very energetic photon emission at b- factories , which is not the case for the relatively low energy of @xmath2- factory .",
    "the typical kinematical configuration at a b- factory is thus an energetic photon and hadrons going in opposite directions .",
    "as the fsr contributions are enhanced only in the kinematical regions , where the hadrons and photons directions overlap , the fsr is naturally suppressed at b - factories and it is not suppressed at the @xmath2- factory daphne , where special care is needed to deal with it .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fsrlo ] , where the relative contribution of the leading order fsr corrections is plotted for the @xmath9 differential cross section .",
    "even if the fsr contribution at daphne is sizable , when no event selection is used , it is relatively easy to choose an event selection , which suppresses this unwanted background . a simple choice is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fsrlo ] , but more sophisticated ( and efficient ) solutions can be found , as it was done by the kloe collaboration in their pion form factor measurement @xcite .     +    as the leading order contributions are suppressed at b- factories by the choice of specific kinematical configurations , it is not a surprise that the next to leading corrections , which are not suppressed by that choice , are bigger then the leading corrections .",
    "they amount up to a few percent and do depend on the invariant mass of the pion pair , and therefore have to be taken into account , when aiming for a precise measurement .    for daphne energies the event selection used by kloe to suppress the fsr contributions does not allow for a measurement of the pion form factor in the threshold region .",
    "that region might be important , as the contributions from low invariant masses are enhanced by the kernel function in the dispersion relations for the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "releasing the cuts allows for measuring in the threshold region , but in the same time the model dependence of the fsr contribution becomes a serious problem @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the fsr , also for the specific case of a @xmath2- factory , where the radiative @xmath2- decays play a role , were performed in many theoretical papers @xcite and that discussion will not be repeated here .",
    "one comment is , however , in order : the final solution to that problem can only come through close collaboration between theoretical and experimental groups and the analysis of both on peak and off peak data is crucial for the success of the program @xcite .",
    "the current version of the phokhara 6.0 monte carlo event generator is a product of many years of theoretical investigations , calculations and code testing .",
    "it relies on virtual ( + soft ) radiative corrections to the isr calculated in @xcite and isr hard photon corrections calculated by means of the helicity amplitudes and implemented into an efficient monte carlo event generator in @xcite .",
    "the fsr at the next to leading order was investigated , and implemented into the event generator , for muon and pion pair production in @xcite .",
    "in addition , very specific contributions to fsr , important at the @xmath2- factory daphne and coming from radiative @xmath2- decays , was studied in @xcite .",
    "all the implemented parts of the developed code are tested to achieve a relative technical precision of few times @xmath10 .",
    "independent tests were performed in @xcite , where the authors compared isr contributions of muons present in phokhara against the kkmc event generator @xcite . an excellent agreement between non exponentiated version of the kkmc and phokhara",
    "was found , while higher order corrections , not implemented yet in the phokhara , give at most two per mill contributions for the invariant masses of the muons relevant for the radiative return method .    with phokhara 6.0",
    "one can now generate the following final states : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , accompanied by one or two isr photons .",
    "the fsr corrections are implemented only for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while in the prepared new release they are implemented also for @xmath15 and @xmath17 final states .",
    "the narrow resonance ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) contributions to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 will also be implemented there .",
    "the @xmath23 pair production and decays are implemented at the leading order only @xcite , but as the expected number of events is modest , the accuracy of the code is sufficient for the description of this process .",
    "the spin asymmetries and spin - spin correlations of the lambdas provide information about real and imaginary parts of the lambda form factors .",
    "to measure them , one needs only the information on the angular distributions of the produced lambdas and pions coming from their decays @xcite .",
    "a step towards such a measurement was done by babar in @xcite , but only a limited part of the information contained in the data was actually used .",
    "the model describing the four pion channels was improved , based on experimental information from babar @xcite and cmd2 @xcite charged mode measurements together with cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite spectral functions .",
    "the preliminary results indicate some isospin symmetry breaking effects , if one also adds information from the preliminary babar measurement of the neutral mode @xcite .",
    "even if relatively few final states are implemented in the distributed version of phokhara , as compared to the plethora of available final states , the implementation of the missing channels by a potential user is not difficult , at least for the isr part , due to the modular structure of the program .",
    "this was done for example by the belle collaboration and used in @xcite .",
    "the 0.5% accuracy of the isr corrections in phokhara will soon be the biggest contribution to the error in the pion form factor extraction by kloe .",
    "inclusion of the leading logarithmic corrections from the second loop to one photon emission , leading logarithmic corrections at one loop level to two photon emission and implementation of the three hard photon emission is expected to bring the accuracy to the 0.2% level and this will be the priority of the physics program of the group in the near future .",
    "it will follow the accuracy improvement @xcite of the babayaga code used by kloe for the luminosity measurement .    -0.5",
    "the present status of the radiative return research program was outlined and plans for the near future work towards further improvements of the phokhara monte carlo generator were sketched .",
    "0.5 cm    the publication is based in a big part on results obtained in collaboration with j.  h.  khn , e.  nowak - kubat and g.  rodrigo .",
    "the authors are grateful for many useful discussions concerning experimental aspects of the radiative return method to members of the kloe , babar and belle collaborations , mainly cesare bini , achim denig , simon eidelman , wolfgang kluge , debora leone , stefan mller , federico nguyen , evgeni solodov , graziano venanzoni and ping wang .",
