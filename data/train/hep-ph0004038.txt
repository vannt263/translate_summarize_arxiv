    "a popular model assumes that at low energies the @xmath0 interactions with ordinary particles of the standard model ( sm ) can be described by the effective gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "an alternative choice is the gauge group @xmath4 @xcite .",

    ", the main idea is to find correlations between the @xmath0 couplings at low energies .",
    "a straightforward way to find the correlations is to specify the underlying theory describing interactions at energies @xmath7 and to consider running of the couplings from high to low energies @xmath8 by using the renormalization group ( rg ) equations . in this approach",
    ", each underlying theory leads to the unique values of the parameters and , hence , the corresponding correlations are model dependent ones . another way is to specify a basis low - energy theory ( for instance , the sm can be chosen ) and to determine the relations between the @xmath0 parameters , following from some model independent arguments .",
    "these correlations are to be model independent .",
    "naturally , they remain dependent on the chosen basis low - energy theory .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the method for derivation model independent correlations between the parameters of physics beyond the sm has been developed , and new observables convenient in searching for the @xmath0 boson in four - fermion processes were introduced .",
    "this approach is based on principles of the rg and the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "as it was argued , any virtual heavy particle can be treated as an `` external field '' scattering the sm particles .",
    "the vertex describing interaction with the field contains a numeric factor , which is considered as an arbitrary parameter .",

    "the scattering amplitude in the `` external field '' satisfies some simple relation ( named rg relation ) , which includes the @xmath9 and @xmath10 functions entering the rg equation .",
    "these functions have to be calculated with the light particles only , and the vertex factor .",

    "as it will be shown in what follows , there is an important difference between these two types of interactions .",
    "thus , in order to derive the model independent constraints we choose the thdm as the low - energy basis theory ( notice , the minimal sm is a particular case of the thdm ) .",
    "then , we introduce a general parametrization of linear in @xmath0 couplings , which is independent of the specific underlying theory . as a result , the derived rg correlations are model independent ones .",
    "they hold for the thdm as well as for the minimal sm . moreover",
    ", the existence of other heavy particles with masses @xmath12 does not affect these correlations .",
    "as it will be shown , there are two completely different sets of the @xmath0 couplings to the sm fields compatible with renormalizability .",

    "the corresponding value of @xmath40 is @xcite @xmath42    at low energies , when all heavy states are decoupled , the @xmath0 interactions with the scalar doublets can be parametrized in a model independent way as follows @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the charges associated with the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the @xmath0 gauge groups , respectively , @xmath49 are the pauli matrices , @xmath50 is the generator corresponding to the gauge group of the @xmath0 boson , and @xmath51 is the @xmath48 hypercharge .",
    "the condition @xmath52 guarantees that the vacuum is invariant with respect to the gauge group of photon .    the vector bosons , @xmath53 , @xmath33 , and @xmath0 , are related with the symmetry eigenstates as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the adopted in the sm value of the weinberg angle , and @xmath56 as is seen , the mixing angle @xmath57 is of order @xmath58 .",
    "that results in the corrections of order @xmath59 to the interactions between the sm particles . to avoid the tree - level mixing of the @xmath33 boson and the physical scalar field @xmath32 one has to impose the condition @xmath60",
    "now , let us parametrize the fermion - vector interactions introducing the effective low - energy lagrangian @xcite : @xmath61 where the renormalizable type interactions are admitted and the summation over the all sm left - handed fermion doublets , @xmath62 , and the right - handed singlets , @xmath63 , is understood .",

    "this restriction leads to four different models , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in",

    "as is known , @xmath77-matrix elements are to be invariant with respect to the rg transformations , which express the independence of the location of a normalization point @xmath78 in the momentum space . in a theory with",
    "different mass scales the decoupling of heavy loop contributions at the thresholds of heavy masses , @xmath79 , results in the important property of low energy amplitudes : the running of all functions is regulated by the loops of light particles . therefore , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 functions at low energies are determined by the sm particles , only .",
    "this fact is the consequence of the decoupling theorem @xcite .",
    "actually , the decoupling results in the redefinition of the parameters of the theory at the scale @xmath79 and removing the all heavy particle loop contributions proportional to @xmath80 from the rg equation @xcite : @xmath81 where we use the notation @xmath82 to refer to the charges , and @xmath83 represents the all fields and masses . hats over quantities mark the parameters of the underlying theory .",
    "they include the loops of both the sm and the heavy particles , whereas the quantities without hats are calculated assuming that no heavy particles are excited inside loops .",
    "the matching between the both sets of parameters ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) is chosen to be done at the normalization point @xmath86 , @xmath87 since the sets of parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 differ at one - loop level , it is possible to substitute one set by another .    as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the redefinition of fields and charges ( [ decoupling ] ) allows one to eliminate the one - loop mixing between heavy and light virtual states .",
    "therefore , virtual states of heavy particles can be treated as the `` external fields '' scattering sm particles .",
    "the renormalizability of the underlying theory leads to some relations for vertices describing this scattering , called the rg relations .",
