    "in a recent publication  @xcite we have presented a study of event shapes observables and determinations of @xmath9  using data of @xmath12  annihilations at @xmath13 to @xmath4  gev recorded with the former jade detector @xcite at the petra collider .",
    "this study provided valuable information which was not available before from @xmath14-annihilations in the petra energy range .",
    "the results on @xmath9 , obtained in a similar manner as those from the experiments at lep , demonstrated that the energy dependence of @xmath15  is in good agreement with the prediction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . evolved to the @xmath16 mass scale , the results are in good agreement with those obtained at lep , and are of similar precision .",
    "in addition , power corrections , applied to analytic qcd calculations of the mean values of event shape distributions , were found to qualitatively and quantitatively match the effects of hadronisation .",
    "thus qcd could be tested without the need of phenomenological hadronisation models .",
    "meanwhile the perturbative calculations for the jet broadening variables were improved by including a proper treatment of quark recoil  @xcite .",
    "furthermore for the @xmath2-parameter a resummation of leading and next - to - leading logarithm terms to all orders of @xmath9  ( nlla ) became available  @xcite . beside these advances in the perturbative description of event shape observables progress was made in the understanding of non - perturbative power corrections to the event shape observables and their mean values .",
    "in particular two - loop calculations of such corrections were performed @xcite which modify the one - loop result of the power correction to the event shapes by a factor ( milan factor ) .    in this paper",
    "we complement our previous publication by a new @xmath17+nlla determination of @xmath9  from @xmath2-parameter and update the determination from jet broadening at @xmath18 and @xmath4 gev in the sections  [ sec - procedure ] and [ sec - alphas ] .",
    "we also applied power corrections to the @xmath2-parameter distributions and re - investigated those for the mean values of the thrust , heavy jet mass and both jet broadening observables in section  [ sec - meanvalues ] .",
    "we start in section  [ sec - data ] with a brief summary of the data samples used and draw conclusions from our results in section  [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "we analysed data recorded with the jade detector in 1984 to 1986 at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath19-@xmath20  gev and around @xmath21  gev .",
    "the jade detector was operated from 1979 until 1986 at the petra electron - positron collider at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath22 to @xmath20 gev .",
    "a detailed description of the jade detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the main components of the detector were the central jet chamber to measure charged particle tracks and the lead glass calorimeter to measure energy depositions of electromagnetic showers , which both covered almost the whole solid angle of @xmath23 .",
    "multihadronic events were selected by the standard jade selection cuts  @xcite .",
    "all charged particle tracks , assumed to be pions , with a total momentum of @xmath24  mev@xmath25 were considered in the analysis .",
    "energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter , assumed to be photons , were considered if their energies exceeded @xmath26 mev after correction for energy deposited by associated tracks .",
    "background from two - photon processes and @xmath27-pair events and from events with hard initial state photon radiation were removed by cuts on the visible energy @xmath28 , the total missing momentum @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the 3-momentum and the energy of the tracks and clusters ) , the longitudinal balance relative to the @xmath12  beam axis of momenta @xmath32 and the polar angle of the thrust axis , @xmath33 :    * @xmath34  ; * @xmath35  ; * @xmath36  ; * @xmath37  .",
    "thus the backgrounds from @xmath38 and @xmath27-pair events were reduced to less than @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the numbers of events which were retained after these cuts for this analysis are listed in table  [ tab - eventnumbers ] .",
    ".[tab - eventnumbers ] number of events in data and in monte carlo detector simulation retained after application of the multihadron selection cuts described in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
