    "following the discovery of the top quark at the tevatron in run i  @xcite , one of the aims of the current round of data - taking is to study the top quark in more detail .",
    "in addition to the accumulation of further statistics in the @xmath0 pair - production channel , both collaborations are performing a search for single top production  @xcite . since single top production proceeds by the exchange ( or production ) of a @xmath1 boson",
    ", it offers another window into the weak interactions of the top quark and potentially can lead to a direct measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "relative to the @xmath0 pair - production channel , single top production is suppressed by the weak coupling but favored by phase space .",
    "we shall report here on the method of inclusion of single top processes into the general next - to - leading order monte carlo program mcfm  @xcite and give phenomenological results relevant to the search strategy in run ii . at the born level",

    "the processes shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schannel]-[eq : twchannel ] ) are schematic .",
    "the actual implementation in the program includes a sum over all contributing partons in the initial state .",
    "in addition , we also include the leptonic decay of the top quark , t + e^+ + b , which allows a better comparison with experimental studies .",
    "although some information can be extracted from born - level calculations , the first serious approximation in qcd is obtained by including @xmath6 radiative corrections .",
    "we shall refer to this as next - to - leading order , ( nlo ) .",
    "it is only in nlo that a calculation gives any information about the choice of factorization and renormalization scale .",
    "moreover , if the calculation includes jets in the final state , it is only in nlo that one obtains first information about the structure of the jets .",
    "the nlo corrections to the inclusive @xmath3-channel mode have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and the corrections to the inclusive @xmath4-channel process have been considered in  ref .",

    "we extend this program by adding the leptonic decay of the top quark with full spin correlations , as noted above , and also by including the effects of gluon radiation in the decay .",
    "the approximations employed in incorporating the qcd corrections are described in section  [ qcdcorrections ] .",
    "section  [ topdecay ] outlines the calculation of the @xmath7 corrections to the decay of a free top quark which is helpful to establish notation .",
    "the subtraction method which we use to include the radiative corrections to the decay of a top quark in the single top production processes is described in section  [ implementation ] .    the search for single top is expected to be more challenging than top - antitop associated production , both because of the smaller cross section and the presence of larger backgrounds .",
    "we therefore give a full account of the signal and background processes in section  [ pheno ] .",
    "both the signal and the dominant background processes are evaluated at next - to - leading order .",
    "in order to describe the inclusion of radiative corrections we shall discuss the @xmath3-channel process .",
    "the diagrams for the @xmath4-channel process can easily be constructed by crossing .",
    "they are obtained by reading the diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : initialrad]-[fig : finalv ] from bottom to top , instead of from left to right .",
    "some of the statements made below are specific to the @xmath3-channel process , but the extensions to the @xmath4-channel process are obvious .",
    "we shall work in the on - shell approximation for the top quark .",
    "thus every diagram considered has one top quark exactly on its mass shell .",
    "diagrams without an on - shell top quark are suppressed by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the width and mass of the top quark . in this approximation",
    "the real radiative corrections fall into three types : radiation associated with the initial state  ( fig .",

    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : real ]",
    ". we also neglect the virtual radiation diagrams that link the production and decay stages , fig .",
    "[ fig : virt ] .    ]    ]    the physical reason for the neglect of these diagrams has been provided in refs .",
    "the characteristic time scale for the production of the @xmath11 pair is of order @xmath12 while the time for the decay is @xmath13 .",
    "therefore in general , radiation in the production and decay stages are separated by a large time and the interference effects average to zero .",
    "the potentially dangerous region for this argument is the one in which the emitted gluon is soft since this effect is not confined to a time of order @xmath12 .",
    "the phase space for soft radiation is limited by the region in which the propagators remain resonant and the gluon energy is less than of order @xmath9 .",
    "however because of the cancellation of real and virtual radiation the region of soft radiation is not especially privileged .",
    "thus for infrared safe variables these interference effects are expected to be of order @xmath14 .",
    "confirmation of this suppression for the @xmath3-channel process is provided by the work of pittau  @xcite , who included interference between the decay and production stages .",
    "the final results are consistent with an effect of order @xmath15 .",
    "a similar study has been performed for @xmath16 including the subsequent decay of the top quarks  @xcite . here",
    "the effect of nonfactorizable corrections in the invariant mass distribution of the top was found to be very small .",

    ", we have consistently used the dipole subtraction method for massless particles as developed by catani and seymour  @xcite .",
    "for the case of single top production we have a massive quark in the final state , so we have implemented a generalization of this scheme as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "a useful further generalization has been suggested by nagy and trcsnyi  @xcite , who introduced a tunable parameter @xmath17 which controls the size of the subtraction region .",
    "we have extended the massive results of ref .",
    "@xcite to include this parameter .",
    "further details may be found in appendix  [ app : alphadep ] .    in order to deal with radiation in the decay stage of the process",
    "we have developed a specialized subtraction procedure , which we discuss in section  [ implementation ] .",
    "we expect that this method may be useful in other contexts .",
    "in particular , it could be applied to the decay of the top quarks in the @xmath0 production process .",
    "one of the new results in this paper is the inclusion of the qcd corrections to the decay of a top quark in a monte carlo program .",
    "since the phase space for the decay of an on - shell top quark factorizes from the production phase space , most of the features of the full calculation are present in the decay of an isolated top quark . for simplicity , and in order to introduce the notation , we first reproduce the well - known result for radiation from a free top quark  @xcite .    the lowest order process is @xmath18 , where the momenta carried by the fields are shown in brackets . the matrix element summed and averaged over initial spin and color is , |_0|^2 = 2 m_t^4 ( 1-r^2 ) ( 1 + 2r^2 ) . where we have defined @xmath19 . for the case of an on - shell @xmath1 boson , @xmath20 .",

    ", one sees that the background rates are still large in the region of @xmath36 where the signal processes peak .",
    "this is demonstrated more clearly in figure  [ fig : htoverall ] , where we show the @xmath36 distribution for the sum of all the backgrounds , the sum of the two single top processes and the total when combining signal and background .",
    "although the single top signal represents about @xmath37 of the events in the bins of interest , an observation of this top production mechanism using the @xmath36 distribution is heavily reliant on accurate predictions of both the rates and shapes of the background processes .",

    "[ fig : ht ] and  [ fig : htoverall ] depend on the particular values chosen for the efficiencies and will improve if better values are achieved .",

    "radiation in the decay is performed using a new subtraction method , which may be useful in other contexts .",
    "we have studied the effects of the nlo corrections on two distributions that are relevant for single top searches at the tevatron .",
    "the inclusion of the top quark decay is imperative for such an analysis for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the cuts that are applied ( in order to match the experimental analysis ) are on the decay products and not on the top quark itself .",
    "second , one of the distributions of interest , @xmath36 , can only be calculated when the momenta of the decay products are known .",
    "we have also performed the calculation of a number of important backgrounds at nlo and examined the feasibility of using variables such as @xmath36 and @xmath38 to discriminate between the single top signal and the main backgrounds .",
    "we find that the inclusion of radiation in the decay makes very little difference in the shapes of these distributions , but further decreases the exclusive two - jet signal cross section .",
    "our treatment is obviously approximate , because we assume @xmath43-independent efficiencies , stable @xmath21 and @xmath44 quarks and include no showering or hadronization .",
    "nevertheless it confirms that the search for single top is extremely challenging and suggests that significantly larger tagging efficiencies and/or methods with greater discriminatory power will be needed to observe single top production .",

    "@xmath45 corresponds to integration over the whole dipole phase space and for @xmath46 the volume of phase space for the dipole subtraction is reduced .",
    "as detailed in  @xcite this serves a number of purposes .",
    "since the subtraction is smaller , the mis - match between real matrix elements and subtractions is also reduced , leading to fewer events where the event and counter - event fall into different bins .",
