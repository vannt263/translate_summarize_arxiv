    "solid state systems have emerged as a promising candidate for the construction of a large scale quantum computer ( qc ) . in particular spin based architectures take advantage of the relatively long spin dephasing times of donor electrons or nuclei in silicon .",
    "single qubit operations are performed by tuning the spin zeeman energy to be resonant with an oscillating field which drives the transition while neighbouring qubits are coupled via the electron exchange interaction , whether it be directly in the case of electron - spin proposals @xcite , or indirectly in the case of nuclear spin quantum computers .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on the kane@xcite concept of single phosphorus donor nuclear spin qubits embedded in a silicon substrate , which is a leading candidate in the search for a scalable qc architecture . the kane architecture ( shown in fig .  [ fig : kanepic ] . )",
    "calls for the placement of phosphorus donors at subsitutional ( face - centred cubic ( fcc ) ) sites in the host silicon matrix , with inter - donor spacings of order 200 . quantum logic operations on the nuclear - spin qubits",
    "are implemented through coherent control of the donor electron wavefunctions which are coupled to the donor nuclei through the contact hyperfine interaction .",
    "this control of the electron wavefunctions is achieved through application of voltage biases to control gates placed on the substrate surface above ( a - gate ) , and between ( j - gate ) the phosphorus donors , which create electrostatic potentials within the device thus altering the form of the electron wavefunctions .    in a recent paper , koiller , hu and das sarma ( khd ) @xcite presented theoretical evidence for oscillations in the electron - mediated exchange coupling as a function of inter - donor separation , and a strong dependence of this coupling on the relative orientation of the two donors with respect the structure of the silicon substrate .",
    "they calculate the exchange coupling using an approximate version of the heitler - london formalism and by essentially ignoring the periodic part of the bloch wavefunctions in the expression for the donor electron wavefunctions . in this article",
    "we eliminate both these approximations , by calculating the exchange coupling in the full heitler - london formalism and by including the full bloch structure of the donor electron wavefunction .",
    "we show that while the first approximation breaks down for small donor separations , as discussed by khd themselves @xcite , the second approximation , that of ignoring the periodic part of the bloch functions , is in excellent agreement with the full calculations regardless of the donor orientation .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ section : dwf ]",
    "we review the calculation of the valence electron wavefunctions for phosphorus donors in silicon , in the kohn - luttinger effective mass formalism . in section  [ section : hlf ]",
    "we discuss the heitler - london formalism used to calculate the exchange coupling between neighbouring donor electrons , and we show that the terms that arise due to the periodic part of the bloch functions oscillate sufficiently rapidly so as to average to zero over the range of the integrals .",
    "section  [ section : fab ] contains a discussion of some of the fabricational issues that arise from the strong position dependence of the exchange energy on the production of a phosphorus donor based solid state quantum computer .",
    "section  [ section : vdep ] is devoted to a calculation of the dependence of the exchange coupling between neighbouring donor electrons on voltage biases applied to the control j - gate , used to tune the inter - qubit coupling .",
    "by extending the conventional effective mass formalism we construct a basis of non - isotropic hydrogen like envelope functions in which we expand the donor - electron wavefunction in the presence of the electric potentials .",
    "the potential created inside the device due to the j - gate bias is calculated using a commercial software package specifically designed for the modelling of semiconductor devices .",
    "donor wavefunctions are obtained by direct diagonalisation , and the heitler - london formalism is used to determine the exchange coupling for various gate biases and donor separations oriented in the silicon [ 100 ] direction .",
    "although the qubits of the kane quantum computer are encoded by the nuclear spins , it is the donor electron which mediates both single and coupled gate operations . therefore , the crucial element in the quantum description of the device is the donor electron wave function .",
    "initial attempts to describe the operation of the device , particularly in response to external time dependent gate potentials which complicate the situation considerably , have focused on effective hydrogenic - type approximations for the donor electron wave function@xcite , or the use of simplified potentials @xcite .",
    "these calculations provide some useful estimates , however more detailed calculations are required , using realistic models of both the donor electron wavefunction and the potentials induced inside the device by the application of control gate biases .    in going beyond the effective hydrogenic treatment of the ground - state electron wave function for phosphorus donors in silicon it is recognised that the underlying crystal structure of the silicon must have an effect .",
    "the wavefunction is thus expanded in the basis of the bloch functions for silicon , @xcite @xmath0 the coefficients @xmath1 are obtained by substituting the above form into the schrdinger equation , with the hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian for the pure silicon crystal and @xmath4 is the donor - potential for phosphorus .",
    "the bloch functions can be written in the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a function that shares the periodicity of the lattice , and can be expanded in a basis of plane waves with wave - vectors equal to the reciprocal lattice vectors for silicon @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the result is that the schrdinger equation can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fourier transform of the impurity potential .",
    "the @xmath11 are the eigenenergies of the bloch functions @xmath12 , for the pure silicon lattice .",
    "we make the approximation that due to the increased energies of the higher bands , only conduction band states contribute to the impurity wavefunction .",
    "further , in silicon there are six degenerate conduction band minima , located along the @xmath13 directions in @xmath14-space , 85% of the way between the centre ( @xmath15 point ) , and the zone boundary ( @xmath16 point ) . because of the reduced energies in these regions the envelope functions can be expressed as a sum of functions localised around each of the conduction band minima @xmath17 .    in the effective - mass treatment @xcite the bloch energies",
    "are expanded to second order around the conduction band minima @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the component of @xmath20 perpendicular to @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the parallel component .",
    "the @xmath23 are effective masses and the inequality of these two values reflects the anisotropy of the conduction band minima .",
    "an additional approximation is made whereby only the terms with @xmath24 in the potential term of the schrdinger equation are included .",
    "the assumption is that @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "this approximation is well satisfied for a coulombic potential @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the dielectric constant for silicon , and with the reciprocal lattice vectors of magnitude @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an integer and @xmath31  is the lattice spacing for silicon .",
    "another way of viewing the approximation is that the terms @xmath32 in the first line of eq .",
    "[ equation : schroedinger ] oscillate on a scale sufficiently short compared to variations in @xmath33 , that they average the integrand to zero .",
    "we will show in the next section that the same approximation allows us to ignore the periodic part of the bloch functions in the donor electron wavefunctions when performing heitler - london integrations .",
    "one further approximation is necessary , @xmath34 , which coupled with the relation @xmath35 gives the effective mass schrdinger equation @xmath36 in the standard effective mass treatment the so - called valley - orbit terms , which couple the envelope functions at different conduction band minima are ignored , and we are left with six independent equations , one for each minimum . with a coulombic impurity potential the solutions are non - isotropic hydrogenic wavefunctions of the form @xmath37}{\\sqrt{6",
    "\\pi a_{\\perp}^2 a_{\\parallel } } } , \\label{equation : envelope}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and we have used the example of the envelope function localised around the @xmath39-minima of the conduction band .",
    "the kohn - luttinger@xcite form for the electron wavefunction of a donor situated at any position @xmath40 is then given by @xmath41 where the periodic part of the bloch function is indepedant of the position of the substitutional impurity .",
    "the values @xmath42 , are the effective bohr radii , and are determined variationally @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the valley orbit coupling does contribute to the the energy of the state @xcite , particularly if the donor potential is not coulombic as is the case in the immediate vicinity of the donor nucleus .",
    "the consequence of this is that the donor electron binding energy given by this wave function is @xmath43mev , significantly lower than the experimental value of @xmath44mev @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is thought to arise from the deviation of the donor potential from a purely coulombic potential as well as the effect of a non - static dielectric constant in silicon @xcite .",
    "it is expected however that at distances of more than approximately an effective bohr radius from the donor nucleus , the donor potential should be approximately coulombic and so eq .  [ equation : donor_wf ] will provide a good description of the true donor electron in this region@xcite .",
    "thus the kohn - luttinger form of the donor - electron wavefunction should be adequate for the purposes of calculating exchange energies for donor separations in the range considered in this article .    a plot of the donor electron wave function along three directions of high symmetry , calculated using effective bohr radii as determined by koiller _",
    "et al _ @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wf ] for a donor placed at a substitutional lattice site .",
    "the coefficients @xmath45 , were calculated using the simple local empirical pseudopotential method as outlined in reference @xcite , and a basis of 125 states .",
    "this method accurately reproduces the electronic band structure for silicon , particularly in the region of interest for this calculation , the lowest conduction bands , as obtained using more complicated non - local pseudo - potential techniques .",
    "the donor electron wave functions obtained in this manner clearly display oscillations produced by the interference between the bloch functions located at the different conduction band minima .",
    "the wavefunctions are real , and in the [ 111 ] direction slightly asymmetric , the asymmetry being a consequence of the presence of the second sub - lattice . in the [ 111 ] orientation",
    "the silicon atoms are nor evenly spaced , and so the neighbouring silicon atom on one side of the phosphorus donor is much closer than that on the other side .",
    "superimposed over the donor wave function is an isotropic @xmath46 hydrogenic envelope with a bohr radius of @xmath47   , reflecting the effect of the superposition of the non - isotropic envelope functions @xmath48 .",
    "the two electron hamiltonian for a system of two donors separated by a vector @xmath40 , in effective rydberg units is : @xmath49 in the standard heitler - london approximation@xcite one assumes that the lowest energy two electron wavefunction of the two - donor system is simply a correctly symmetrised superposition of single electron wavefunctions centred around each of the two donors @xmath50 where the two donors are located at positions @xmath51 .",
    "this approximation is asymptotically exact and should hold for separations greater than the effective bohr radii , @xmath52 .",
    "the anti - symmetry of the fermion wavefunction then tells us that the exchange splitting , the difference in energies between the spin singlet and triplet spin states , is simply equal to the difference in energy between the states @xmath53 , that is @xmath54 .    in this article",
    "we present our results in terms of the exchange , or j coupling , in the exchange term of the effective spin hamiltonian , @xmath55 , which is common to the quantum computing literature .",
    "we make this decision despite the observation that it is the exchange splitting , the energy difference between the single and triplet states , that is most commonly presented in the solid - state literature .",
    "these quantities are related by the expression @xmath56 .    in the heitler - london formalism",
    "the exchange coupling can be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the hamiltonian one can rewrite this as : @xmath57 where the overlap integrals are given explicitly by : @xmath58 computation of these expressions using the kohn - luttinger wave function without approximation is rather tedious , given the large number reciprocal lattice vectors it is necessary to sum over to evaluate the periodic part of the bloch functions for each of the six bloch states in the donor electron wavefunction .",
    "we have used an adaptive monte - carlo quadrature program to evaluate all overlap integrals , taking due care to obtain reasonable precision .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : j ] we plot the exchange energy as a function of donor separation in each of the major lattice directions . for comparison the result using an isotropic hydrogenic wave function",
    "is also given .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained using the method of khd in their original paper @xcite , who used two major approximations in order to make the calculation more tractable , some of which are discussed in detail in references @xcite .",
    "first , the heitler - london expression for the exchange energy is approximated by the coulomb exchange integral alone , an approximation that is asymptotically quite good , however it is this approximation that is responsible for the difference between our result and that obtained by khd in reference @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors have used the complete form for the heitler - london expression , and obtained results that match those presented here .    the other approximation made is to effectively ignore the contribution of the periodic part of the bloch functions @xmath59 ; this is an excellent approximation as can be seen from the figures in which it is almost impossible to distinguish between the results obtained in this approximation and those for which the detailed bloch structure was included .",
    "the ability to ignore the periodic part of the bloch structure in the computation of the heitler - london integrals significantly reduces the complexity of the calculation by eliminating the sums over reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "it is worth examining this approximation in more detail as we find it is effectively the same approximation as is made in effective mass formalism to obtain the kohn - luttinger form for the donor electron wavefunction .",
    "the heitler - london integrals are all of the form @xmath60 the various potentials represented in the above expression as @xmath61 are all impurity potentials of a similar nature to those encountered in the effective mass formalism , and so we expect that they are sufficiently slowly varying that we can safely ignore the rapidly oscillating terms in the above integrand , in exactly the same manner",
    ". this immediately gives @xmath62 which is equivalent to setting @xmath59 in eq .",
    "[ eq : integralform ] .",
    "the `` rapidly oscillating '' terms include the exponentials containing the values of @xmath14 at the conduction band minima , which are separated by a minimum magnitude of @xmath63 .",
    "this separation is sufficiently large to allow us to ignore terms except those for which @xmath64 . since @xmath65 , this allows us to ignore the periodic part of the bloch functions in the heitler - london integrals .",
    "the observed extreme sensitivity of the exchange coupling on the relative orientation of the two phosphorus donors sets stringent requirements on the placement of donors for any quantum computer architecture that is reliant on the exchange interaction to couple qubits . in this section",
    "we discuss these implications for the construction of a kane nuclear spin quantum computer .",
    "fabrication of the kane solid - state quantum computer is being pursued along two parallel paths @xcite . in the so called `` bottom up ''",
    "approach , individual phosphorus donors are effectively placed with atomic precision on a phosphorus surface by application of phosphine gas to a hydrogen terminated silicon surface in which individual hydrogen atoms have been removed at the proposed donor site using a scanning - tunnelling microscope tip .",
    "the hydrogen mono - layer is then removed and the surface overgrown with phosphorus @xcite .",
    "although this approach has not been fully developed , it is likely that it will be able to produce an array of donors located at precise fcc substitutional sites , to within a few lattice spaces .",
    "small displacements are inevitable however and can have dramatic effects on the exchange coupling between the donors .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : displaced ] where we show a plot of the exchange coupling as a function of the magnitude of the displacement @xmath66 of the second phosphorus dopant from its desired position at a fcc substitutional site a distance of 200.91 , in the [ 100 ] direction , from the first dopant .",
    "these dopants have been displaced by no more than four fundamental lattice spacings on either of the two fcc lattices that make up the silicon matrix , however the exchange coupling varies by more than an order of magnitude emphasising the need for precise placement .    the second approach , known as the the top down approach calls for the implantation if the phosphorus donors into the silicon using an ion beam of phosphorus ions incident on the substrate @xcite .",
    "the precision of such a technique in the placement of dopants is fundamentally limited by the phenomenon known as `` straggling '' , whereby the implanted ions scatter from the nuclei of the host silicon atoms .",
    "simulations of this process for a beam of 15kev phosphorus ions implanted into silicon , an energy appropriate for an implantation depth of approximately 200  into the silicon substrate , give a roughly gaussian distribution for the final position of the dopant with a variance of about 90  in the transverse direction , and 100  in the longitudinal direction . using these data , for two dopants implanted 200  apart in the [ 100 ] direction , we have calculated the distribution of exchange couplings between the donor electrons , assuming that after thermal annealing the phosphorus donors take up a position on a fcc substitutional site . fig .",
    "[ fig : probj ] shows a plot the integrated probability , @xmath67 , that is the probability that the exchange coupling greater than a value @xmath68 , for two dopants implanted in the manner just described .    in the case of electron spin quantum computers where it is the exchange energy that directly couples neighbouring qubits , a coupling of 50@xmath69ev corresponds to a gate time of the order of @xmath70ghz .",
    "the top down approach can in this case produce qubits coupled by extremely fast gates with a very high probability . in nuclear spin quantum computers however the exchange interaction only mediates the inter - qubit coupling and the resulting gates are slower .",
    "the original kane proposal calls for an adiabatic implementation of a controlled - not gate that requires a exchange coupling of approximately 50@xmath69ev@xcite .",
    "additional proposals exist for non - adiabatic implementations@xcite for which controlled - not gates can be accurately implemented with a lower exchange coupling .",
    "[ fig : probj ] shows the probability that the bare exchange coupling for implanted donors being greater than 50@xmath69ev , is about @xmath71 . what is more important than the bare coupling however is the values of the exchange coupling that can be achieved with the application of j - gate biases .",
    "we note that khd have performed calculations that suggest a method for overcoming the strong dependence of the the exchange coupling on the donor orientation @xcite .",
    "they calculate the exchange coupling , in the same approximations as discussed earlier , for phosphorus donor electrons in uni - axially strained silicon . the strain is a product of the the silicon host being fabricated on a layer of si@xmath72ge@xmath73 , and is found to suppress the oscillations in the coupling for donors that lie within a plane perpendicular to the direction of the uni - axial strain .",
    "the coupling remains highly sensitive to displacements away from this plane .",
    "inherent in the kane proposal for a solid state quantum computer is the ability to control the exchange coupling of neighbouring donor electrons through the application of voltage biases to a control j - gate placed on the substrate surface between the position of the phosphorus donors , as illustrated in fig  [ fig : kanepic ] . in this section",
    "we calculate the effect on the exchange coupling on the j - gate bias .",
    "some results have been reported on similar calculations .",
    "@xcite used an unrestricted hartree - fock method , which avoids some of the approximations inherent in the heitler - london approach , to calculate the exchange coupling between phosphorus donor electrons as a function of a simplified electric potential .",
    "they use a trial wavefunction of the form @xmath74 , including only one of the six degenerate conduction band minima , with a spherical envelope function , that is one of the same form as eq .",
    "[ equation : envelope ] , but with @xmath75 . as a result of their single minimum approximation",
    "they can not possibly reproduce the oscillatory nature of the coupling which results from interference between the terms localised at the six minima .",
    "they model the potential produced inside the device by the control gate as one - dimensional potential of the form @xmath76mev , where @xmath77 is the distance is along the direction between the two donors which are situated at @xmath78 , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : kanepic ] .    in our calculation",
    "we compute the potential produced inside the device due to the application of a voltage bias to a metallic @xmath68-gate by numerical solution of the poisson equation using a commercial package , tcad @xcite , designed for the semi - conductor industry . in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] we plot the potential parallel to the inter - donor axis , for several values of the @xmath39 co - ordinate , which denotes the distance below the oxide barrier , located at @xmath79 . for more information on the details of the potential calculation",
    "see ref  @xcite .",
    "we compare the potential obtained for a @xmath68-gate voltage of @xmath80v , with the one - dimensional potential of fang _",
    "et al _ and see that the two potentials agree well for @xmath81 , the plane of the donors , provided we set @xmath82",
    ". however we see that for this value of @xmath69 the two potentials are quite different in the planes 50  above and below the donors .",
    "we must therefore conclude that the one - dimensional approximation is not a good one .    to calculate the effect of the applied potential on the electron we expand the wavefunction as follows : @xmath83 where the @xmath84 are non - isotropic hydrogenic envelope functions defined by faulkner @xcite .",
    "the @xmath69 is a label for the six degenerate conduction band minima and determines the direction of the anisotropy of the envelope function , for example @xmath85 , is the hydrogenic function with a bohr radius @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the orthonormality of this basis is enforced by the @xmath88 terms which appear in the matrix elements and due to their rapidly oscillating nature average to zero unless @xmath89 . the coefficients @xmath90 are determined by direct numerical diagonalisation of the hamiltonian in the presence of the electrostatic potential .",
    "we use a basis of 140 states , which includes all states with principle quantum number up to and including @xmath91 , and we re - scale the energies such that the unperturbed ground - state energy gives the experimentally observed value of @xmath92mev for phosphorus donors in silicon .",
    "the donor electron wavefunctions obtained in this way are then used in the heitler - london formalism to calculate the electron exchange energy , as a function of both the donor separation , and applied j - gate bias .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdep ] , for donor separations from 80 - 120   in the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "we see that application of a positive bias will tend to increase the exchange coupling , while a negative bias decreases the strentgh of the coupling .",
    "it is also worth noting that the relative increase in the exchange coupling produced by a given bias increases with the donor separation .",
    "also the change in coupling is strongest at the peaks , the application of a positive bias enhances the oscillations in the exchange coupling whereas a negative bias of magnitude 1v inverts the oscillations such that points that were originally at peaks become troughs .",
    "the range of separations shown in these plots is far less than the approximately 200  donor separation called for in the original kane proposal - we have plotted values over range for ease of comparison with our previous results , and more particularly those of khd . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdep200 ] we plot the exchange coupling as a function of the j - gate bias for donors separated by 200.91  in the [ 100 ] direction . at this separation",
    "a 1v j - gate bias can increase the the exchange coupling by over two orders of magnitude up to a value of approximately 30@xmath69ev .",
    "the exchange coupling can also be reduced via application of a negative bias .    although it is difficult to compare our results with those of fang _",
    "et al _ due to the different potentials , the shift of an order of magnitude obtained for separation of 200  and a bias of 1v is greater than the shift they predict . for a value of @xmath93 fang _",
    "et al _ predict a shift of less than an order of magnitude .",
    "this discrepancy can in part be attributed to the @xmath94 approximation for the gate potential which does not account for the fact that the magnitude of the potential increases as the j - gate is approached from below ( in the @xmath39-direction ) .",
    "we note that it may not be possible to apply voltages much greater than one volt to these nano - scale devices without exceeding the breakdown fields of the various materials involved @xcite .",
    "in agreement with the approximations implicit in the calculations of donor electron exchange energy of koiller _ et al _ @xcite we show explicitly that the periodic part of the bloch functions in the donor electron wavefunctions can be ignored in the heitler - london integrals , greatly reducing the complexity of the calculation .",
    "this has allowed the calculation of the intrinsic exchange coupling for a large number of donor pairs distributed according to the probability distribution for donors implanted 200  apart by 15kev ion beams . in this manner",
    "we have determined the probability distribution of the exchange coupling for the top - down approach for the fabrication of a kane solid - state quantum computer .",
    "in addition we have investigated the application of control gate biases to increase the exchange coupling between donor pairs using both realistic potentials and realistic donor electron wavefunctions .",
    "we find that as expected the exchange coupling can be increased by the application of a positive bias , and decreased with a negative bias . over the range of donor separations",
    "investigated it was found that the relative increase of the exchange coupling produced by a given bias increases with the separation , and for donors separated by 200   in the [ 100 ] direction a 1v bias can increase the coupling by over two orders of magnitude .",

    "<S> inter - valley interference between degenerate conduction band minima has been shown to lead to oscillations in the exchange energy between neighbouring phosphorus donor electron states in silicon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these same effects lead to an extreme sensitivity of the exchange energy on the relative orientation of the donor atoms , an issue of crucial importance in the construction silicon - based spin quantum computers . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the donor electron exchange coupling as a function of donor position incorporating the full bloch structure of the kohn - luttinger electron wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that due to the rapidly oscillating nature of the terms they produce , the periodic part of the bloch functions can be safely ignored in the heitler - london integrals as was done by koiller _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite , significantly reducing the complexity of calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we address issues of fabrication and calculate the expected exchange coupling between neighbouring donors that have been implanted into the silicon substrate using an 15kev ion beam in the so - called top down fabrication scheme for a kane solid - state quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we calculate the exchange coupling as a function of the voltage bias on control gates used to manipulate the electron wavefunctions and implement quantum logic operations in the kane proposal , and find that these gate biases can be used to both increase and decrease the magnitude of the exchange coupling between neighbouring donor electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - bias results reconfirm those previously obtained by koiller _ </S>",
