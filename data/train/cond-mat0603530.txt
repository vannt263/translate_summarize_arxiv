    "the discovery of superconductivity in yb- and ca - intercalated graphites @xcite , with significantly higher @xmath0 s than found previously for alkali - metal graphite intercalation compounds ( gics ) re - initiated the debate on the long - standing puzzle of the origin of superconductivity in gics @xcite .",
    "possible pairing mechanisms under consideration range from unconventional exciton- or plasmon - mediated pairing @xcite to the more conventional electron - phonon ( _ e - ph _ ) coupling mechanism @xcite .",
    "the core of the debate on the origin of superconductivity in the gics are the so - called _ interlayer _ electronic bands which cross the fermi level ( @xmath6 ) besides the graphite @xmath7 bands .",
    "since the coupling of the @xmath7 band electrons to the graphite phonons is not sufficient to yield the observed high @xmath0 s @xcite , the role of the interlayer bands and their degree of filling is considered to be essential for superconductivity with increased @xmath0 s @xcite .",
    "proposed that the electrons in the interlayer bands can be considered as nearly - free 2-dimensional ( 2d ) electrons propagating essentially between the graphene layers @xcite , and pairing can be mediated by acoustic plasmons in these 2d metallic slabs @xcite .",
    "however , there is a growing body of evidence that the interlayer bands have sufficiently strong coupling with both in - plane intercalant and out - of - plane graphite phonon modes to allow for the relatively high @xmath0 s within the scope of a standard _ e - ph _ coupling mechanism @xcite .",
    "this scenario gained some experimental support from recent penetration depth@xcite , specific heat@xcite , tunneling@xcite and ca isotope effect@xcite experiments in cac@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the latter experiments showed a ca isotope effect with @xmath9 , suggesting a dominant role of ca - related modes in the superconducting pairing@xcite .",
    "this finding , however , is at odds with the results of _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations@xcite in which isotope exponents @xmath10 @xmath4 @xmath11 @xmath4 0.25 have been concluded .",
    "the fact that the out - of - plane phonon modes of the host layers can not be ignored gains substantial support from recent investigations on other layered compounds , _ e.g. _ caalsi ( @xmath0 @xmath2 8 k ) , where ca atoms are located in between al - si honeycomb sheets ( alb@xmath12 structure type)@xcite .",
    "hence , a deeper understanding of the superconducting pairing , and of the nature and role of the electronic and vibrational states involved , will provide useful insight into superconductivity in the gics as well as other recently discovered `` high-@xmath0 '' superconductors .",
    "the investigation of the pressure dependence of @xmath0 is a key experiment to test and compare these theoretical predictions .",
    "the degree of filling of the interlayer bands , crucial for the acoustic plasmon pairing mechanism , depends not only on the charge transfer from the intercalant , but also on the separation of the graphene sheets @xcite . by applying hydrostatic pressure the graphite layer spacing , and hence the energy of the interlayer bands ,",
    "can be continuously tuned without affecting the chemical composition . on the other hand ,",
    "a comparison of the pressure dependence of @xmath0 with the results of first - principles calculations of the electronic and vibrational properties of the gics could support or rule out the hypothesis of an _ e - ph _ mediated coupling mechanism @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we report the effect of pressure ( @xmath13 16 kbar ) on @xmath0 of cac@xmath1 and compare our results with _ ab - initio _ calculations of the electronic and vibrational properties carried out as a function of pressure . based on our calculations",
    ", we argue that the increase of @xmath0 with pressure can be understood within the scope of _ e - ph _ coupling as a consequence of a softening of phonon modes involving ca in - plane vibrations , while it is at odds with an acoustic plasmon mechanism .",
    "we also show that there is some discrepancy between the @xmath0 measured from experiment and that predicted by isotropic , harmonic migdal - eliashberg theory , and discuss possible ways to improve the agreement between experiments and theory .",
    "cac@xmath1 samples were prepared as described in detail elsewhere @xcite . the @xmath0 s of three samples",
    "were determined from the temperature dependence of the _ dc _ ( samples s1 and s2 ) and of the _ ac _ magnetic susceptibility ( sample s3 ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 between our samples is less than @xmath2 0.1 k. all samples show a sharp superconducting transition with a width @xmath3@xmath0 @xmath2 0.15 k between 10@xmath5 and 90 @xmath5 of the diamagnetic signal , indicating good sample quality .",
    "cu - be piston - anvil - type pressure cells were used to apply quasi - hydrostatic pressures with silicon oil as the pressure transmitting medium . to monitor the pressure , @xmath0 of pb ( 99.9999% )",
    "was determined simultaneously .    at ambient pressure ,",
    "the onset of the superconducting transition of our samples is @xmath2 11.4 k , consistent with previous reports @xcite .",
    "the superconducting transition is clearly shifted to higher temperatures as the pressure is raised ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "up to 16 kbar there is no indication of an abrupt change of @xmath0 or a narrowing or broadening of the transition , as frequently observed in other superconducting gics , such as _ e.g. _",
    "khgc@xmath14 , kc@xmath15 , rbc@xmath15 , and ascribed to a pressure - induced change of the staging or of the intercalant sublattice @xcite .",
    "no hysteresis in @xmath0 as well as in the shape of @xmath16 was observed between the data taken with increasing and decreasing pressure .",
    "thus the possible shear stresses due to solidification of pressure medium do not affect significantly the superconducting properties of the samples .",

    "although unusual , the softening of a particular phonon mode , usually an indication of an incipient lattice instability , can induce a pressure increase in @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "e.g. _ in the case of the @xmath26-point phonons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) : whereas the c in - plane modes ( @xmath41 mev ) and the ca out - of - plane mode ( @xmath42 mev ) harden with pressure , the c out - of - plane mode ( @xmath43 mev ) are almost unaffected . on the other hand , the lowest - lying optical mode at @xmath26 , and an acoustical mode at @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , both mainly involving in - plane ca vibrations , are considerably softened with pressure . at higher pressures ( @xmath19 @xmath44 120 kbar ) , these modes drive the system unstable .",
    "frozen - phonon calculations reveal that this mode couples to both the interlayer and the @xmath45 bands , and that the mechanism which causes its instability is similar to that giving rise to the anharmonicity of the e@xmath46 mode in mgb@xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the spherical , 3d fermi surface centered around @xmath26 is due to the interlayer band , while the 2d @xmath7 bands form distorted cylinder along the @xmath48 axis .",
    "the position of the special * k * points in this plot are relative to the @xmath19 = 0 lattice constants . ]    to estimate the pressure dependence of the partial @xmath49 associated with the ca in - plane vibrations , we employ a simple approximation based on the hopfield formula : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath34@xmath37@xmath52@xmath39/@xmath53@xmath37@xmath54@xmath39 , where @xmath37@xmath52@xmath39 is the @xmath55-@xmath56 matrix element , @xmath53 is the phonon mass , and @xmath37@xmath54@xmath39 is square averaged phonon frequency .",
    "assuming that @xmath37@xmath57@xmath39 is constant and @xmath37@xmath58@xmath39 can be approximated by the square of the lowest - lying optical phonon frequency at @xmath26 , we find a significant increase of @xmath59 by 20@xmath5 at @xmath19 = 50 kbar , and 60@xmath5 at @xmath19 = 100 kbar with respect to its zero - pressure value . since the low energy phonon modes give dominant contribution to the coupling @xcite , the increase of @xmath59 can be strong enough to overcome the reduction of @xmath34 and as a result , increase @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , it appears that the other proposed pairing mechanism , namely acoustic plasmon - mediated pairing in the interlayer bands @xcite can hardly be reconciled with the observed pressure dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the basic assumption of this model is the existence of 2d metallic layers sandwiched by dielectric layers . if this is the case , due to the significant anisotropy of the fermi velocity and incomplete screening , the plasmon dispersion develops a _ low - energy _ acoustic branch , @xmath60 @xmath2 @xmath61 , which can provide additional pairing routes for superconductivity @xcite .    however , the electronic band structure ( ref .  ) and the corresponding fermi surface ( fs ) plot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) reveal that the interlayer bands are 3d in character . additionally , there is a substantial charge transfer to the graphite @xmath7 states .",
    "both findings question the basic assumptions of this model already at ambient pressure .",
    "the anisotropy of the fermi velocity emerges almost exclusively from the graphite @xmath7 bands , which display a warped cylindrical fs parallel to the @xmath48 axis . with pressure ,",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath7 bands along the @xmath48 axis increases and the 3d character of the electronic structure grows .",
    "when the system becomes more 3d , a gap in the acoustic plasmon dispersion is developed @xcite , and the conventional plasmon dispersion , @xmath60=@xmath62+@xmath63(@xmath64 ) ( @xmath62 @xmath65 @xmath66 ) is fully recovered .",

    "width=302 ]    finally , we check whether the increase of @xmath35 due to the phonon softening is compatible with the observed increase of @xmath0 under pressure by calculating the @xmath55-@xmath56 spectral function @xmath71 and the frequency - dependent @xmath55-@xmath56 coupling parameter @xmath72 . instead of the maximum experimental pressure ( @xmath19 @xmath4 16 kbar ) , we choose to run these calculations at two higher pressures , @xmath19 = 50 and 100 kbar .",
    "we notice , in fact , that the experimental variation of @xmath0 up to @xmath19 @xmath4 16 kbar is too small to be resolved by the accuracy of dft calculations .",
    "therefore , we choose two pressures where the calculated frequencies are all real ( _ i.e. _ the system is structurally stable ) , and where our approximated hopfield equation predicts a sizable increase in @xmath35 ; the second point ( @xmath19 = @xmath73 kbar ) is chosen closed to the predicted structural transition , in order to get an estimate of the maximum attainable @xmath0 in this system .",
    "the @xmath55-@xmath56 spectral function @xmath71 displays three peaks well separated in energy , corresponding to different phonon eigenvectors .",
    "the largest contribution to the total @xmath55-@xmath56 coupling comes from the in - plane ca phonons , which increases @xmath74 to @xmath75 at @xmath19 = 100 ( 50 ) kbar .",
    "the second largest contribution from the c out - of - plane vibrations remains essentially unchanged , since the modes at @xmath2 70 mev are insensitive to the pressure .",
    "the total @xmath35 increases from 0.84 at @xmath19 = 0 to 0.86 at @xmath19 = 50 kbar and 1.03 at @xmath19 = 100 kbar , which results entirely from the soft ca in - plane modes .",
    "we estimate the effect of pressure on @xmath0 using the mcmillan formula @xcite : @xmath76,\\ ] ] where @xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 is the logarithmic averaged phonon frequency and @xmath80 is the coulomb pseudopotential . inserting the calculated @xmath77@xmath78@xmath79 , ( 305 k at @xmath19 = 0 , 300 k at @xmath19 = 50 kbar , and 230 k at @xmath19 = 100 kbar ) , and setting @xmath81 , which reproduces the experimental @xmath0 at zero pressure",

    "both quantities have a strong non - linear behavior.,width=302 ]    after finishing the present work , an experimental study up to @xmath19 @xmath4 160 kbar was posted on the cond - mat archive @xcite . here a transition of @xmath0 at @xmath2 80 kbar was observed , accompanied by lattice softening , thus confirming our theoretical prediction of an upper bound on @xmath0 due to lattice instability . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the experimentally measured @xmath0 , from our work and ref .  , together with the calculated @xmath0 as a function of pressure .",
    "we notice that , even though the positive pressure dependence is well reproduced by our _ ab - initio _ calculations , there are still some discrepancies between experiment and theory , which we shall now discuss in detail .    first of all ,",
    "while experimentally the ( structural ) transition is found at 80 kbar , we predicted it to take place at @xmath2 120 kbar .",
    "it is well known that the structural transition pressure for the gics is very sensitive to several experimental details .",
    "for example , the previous pressure experiments on 1st - stage kc@xmath15 showed large hysteresis of the transition pressure as well as significant time dependence of the order of days or weeks@xcite .",
    "in particular , we note that in the gics t@xmath82 can show a strong anomaly even before a structural transition takes place .",
    "for example , in kc@xmath15 , an intercalant structural transition occurs at @xmath2 14 kbar@xcite , but a sudden increase of @xmath0 is observed already at @xmath2 4 kbar @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this kind of error is also within the accuracy of dft .",
    "while it could possibly be reduced by a more careful convergence of the @xmath33 point frequency with respect to @xmath83 points sampling , there would always be an uncertainty of 10 - 20 kbar related to the choice of the exchange and correlation functional or of the basis set@xcite . however , even if dft can fail to predict the exact transition pressure , it is usually much more accurate in describing structural _ trends _ as a function of pressure .",
    "therefore , it is quite surprising to notice that the behavior of @xmath0 with pressure predicted by theory deviates from that measured experimentally : in particular , theory predicts a much slower increase in @xmath0 ( @xmath84 0.02 k / kbar ) than experiment , and a slightly non - linear behavior , with a stronger increase in t@xmath82 at higher pressures .",
    "such discrepancies indicate that the harmonic , isotropic @xmath55-@xmath56 coupling theory may not be sufficient to describe quantitatively the behavior of cac@xmath1 and other gics .",
    "this confirms what was shown by a very recent , puzzling experiments on the isotope effect  @xcite , which reported surprisingly high isotope exponent for ca , @xmath85(ca ) @xmath4 0.5 , much higher than the value @xmath85(ca ) = 0.24 predicted by theory @xcite . assuming a nontrivial contribution from the c phonon modes , the total isotope exponent will exceed the bcs value of 0.5 .",
    "also , discrepancies between the isotropic , harmonic migdal - eliashberg theory and experiment are found in the specific heat and the upper critical fields @xcite .",
    "further theoretical and experimental works are highly desirable along this direction .    the first possibility to improve the agreement between theory and experiment would be taking into account anharmonic effects or nonlinear coupling of the in - plane ca phonon modes@xcite . in graphite intercalation compounds ,",
    "the vibrational modes associated to the intercalant are extremely soft , and transitions to different in - plane sublattice as well as staging are frequently observed@xcite , which indicates that these modes are strongly anharmonic .    the second approximation which may not be justified , in the present case ,",
    "is that of an isotropic electron - phonon coupling .",
    "as we have previously discussed , the fermi surface of cac@xmath1 is highly anisotropic and is formed by two bands , which have very different electronic origin ( @xmath7 and interlayer ) , and are hence coupled to different phonon modes .",
    "therefore , different sheets of the fermi surface would give very different contributions to the total electron - phonon coupling , possibly giving rise to a `` smeared '' multi - gap superconductivity@xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to compare our results with a very recent _ ab - initio _ calculations@xcite . here",
    "the authors study , using the same code@xcite , but different pseudopotentials , the behavior of cac@xmath1 as a function of pressure . similarly to us , they find a structural transition driven from the softening of the @xmath33-point phonon , at some pressure between 70 and 100 kbar , thus lower than ours and close to the experimental value . between 0 and 50 kbar , they find an increase in @xmath35 of only 0.015 , and estimate an increase in @xmath0 of @xmath2 0.3 k ; they do not calculate the @xmath0 at any other pressure besides 0 and 50 kbar , so it is not possible to compare directly the pressure behavior of the two sets of calculations , but the overall qualitative picture seems to be the same ; the numerical differences in the transition pressure and @xmath35 are probably due to the use of different pseudopotentials and * k*-point sampling .",
    "to explain the difference between theory and experiment , the authors of this paper propose still another possibility , that a continuous staging transition takes place under pressure .",
    "this is of course a possibility which should be taken into account , but a definitive answer in this sense could come only from x - ray or neutron diffraction measurements under pressure .    in conclusion , we presented measurements and _ ab - initio _ calculations of the pressure dependence of @xmath0 in cac@xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrated that the positive pressure dependence of @xmath0 can be understood within an @xmath55-@xmath56 scenario due to softening of the in - plane ca phonon modes , while it appears not to reconcile with the acoustic plasmon mechanism . in view of new experimental findings",
    ", we also discuss which effects beyond the isotropic , harmonic migdal - eliashberg theory would have to be taken into account to obtain a full quantitative and qualitative agreement between theory and experiments in cac@xmath1 , and possibly other graphite intercalation compounds",
