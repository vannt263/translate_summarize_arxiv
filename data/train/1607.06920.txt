    "in the double - differential cross - section for electron scattering by the nucleus , , the contributions from the electron - nucleus interaction may be separated by means of longitudinal and transverse components of the electromagnetic field .",
    "accordingly , these contributions are called the longitudinal and transverse response functions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) . according to ref .",

    "the correction @xmath14 is given by , where @xmath16 is the radius of the equivalent homogeneous distribution .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for electrons scattered by light nuclei to the continuum region the coefficient @xmath17 is equal to 0.8 .    the experimental data on the longitudinal functions @xmath5 are generally represented as coulomb sums @xmath18 ^ 2 } d\\omega , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where . here ,",

    "the behavior of with variations in the momentum transfer is similar in its character . with an increase in @xmath9 ,",
    "the function increases until at a certain momentum transfer value , denoted as @xmath24 , the takes on constant values forming the function plateau . for almost all previously studied nuclei we have @xmath25  @xmath3 . by way of illustration ,",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the experimental values for the @xmath26he nucleus @xcite .",
    "the authors of papers @xcite have determined values for the @xmath0li nucleus , and have found that the behavior of the function differs from the usual one ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the function reaches the plateau at @xmath27  @xmath3 , this being much earlier in @xmath9 than in the case with @xmath28he and other nuclei . in the @xmath1li case , in the measurement range",
    "@xmath29 @xmath3 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the function is constant within the experimental error .",
    "it means that if the value is lower at certain momentum transfers , then it will reach the plateau range at @xmath30 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the data of ref .",
    "@xcite do not specify @xmath24 for the @xmath1li nucleus , but restrict its upper value .",
    "the authors of works @xcite have put forward the hypothesis that a comparatively low @xmath24 value in the @xmath31li case may be due to the coulomb sum manifestation of clusterization peculiar to the nuclei under discussion .",
    "however , on a more rigorous approach to the problem of relationship between the @xmath24 value and nuclear cluster structure it should be noted that this hypothesis is actually based only on the experimental @xmath24 value of the @xmath0li nucleus .",
    "as regards the @xmath24 value of @xmath1li , from the data of @xcite it follows that it is not higher than that of @xmath0li , and it is not improbable that it may be substantially lower .",
    "the last version would be in contrast with the proposed hypothesis , because if the @xmath24 value is related to the clusterization ( and the nuclei @xmath0li and @xmath1li are close in the degree of clusterization ) , then the @xmath32 values of these nuclei should also be little different from each other .",
    "it follows from the above that for checking the hypothesis for the relationship between the nuclear cluster structure and the momentum transfer value @xmath24 , it is necessary :    * to determine the @xmath24 value for the @xmath1li nucleus ; * to define more exactly the @xmath24 value for the @xmath0li nucleus ; * to obtain the @xmath24 values for the previously investigated nuclei .",
    "the measurements , from which the present values were determined , were carried out at the experimental facility sp-95 with the use of the electron beam from the nsc kipt electron linear accelerator lue-300 . the electron beam of monochromaticity between 0.4% and 0.6% , and of energies ranging from 104 to 259 mev , was incident on the @xmath0li ( or @xmath1li ) target , the isotopic enrichment of which in the nuclide of interest was determined to be 90.5% ( or 93.8% ) , respectively .",
    "the measurements were performed at electron scattering angles from 34.2@xmath33 up to 160@xmath33 . for momentum analysis of scattered electrons",
    "we have used the spectrometer that had the second - order double focusing in vertical and horizontal planes @xcite .",
    "electrons in the focal plane of the spectrometer were registered by the 8-channel scintillation cherenkov counter @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup has been described a number of times in the literature , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the measurements and the data processing is presented in refs .",
    "[ 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .",
    "the experiment was designed so that the response functions at several constant 3-momentum transfer values ranging from 0.750 to 1.625 @xmath3 , and also , the coulomb sums corresponding to these functions , could be obtained from the measurements .",
    "it should be mentioned that the most complicated and labor - consuming stage in these experiments is the processing of the measurement results for obtaining the response functions and the coulomb sums . taking into account the long duration of the processing ,",
    "the work was planned so as to process first the data measured at the highest @xmath9 values , and then to process the data corresponding to lower momentum transfers .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach was the point that if the processing of a part of the experimental data yielded the physical data of prime interest , they could be discussed and submitted for publication at once , without waiting for the final processing of the whole body of initial measured data .",
    "at the previous stage of measured data processing , we have obtained in this way four values for @xmath1li at @xmath34 @xmath3 @xcite , and five values for @xmath0li at @xmath35 @xmath3 @xcite .    by the present time , in addition to the above - given values , we have obtained values for @xmath1li at @xmath36 @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and preliminary values for @xmath0li at @xmath37  @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "to analyse the relationship between the momentum transfer @xmath24 and the nuclear cluster structure , the @xmath24 value determination must be formalized using a certain simple procedure , which will be applied to the experimental values of the nuclei under consideration .",
    "we define @xmath24 as the momentum transfer that corresponds to the point of intersection of two straight lines , one of which ( horizontal ) approximates the values on the plateau of , and the other line approximates the values before reaching the plateau starting from , where is the value on the plateau .",
    "the given definition of the momentum transfer @xmath24 is exemplified by the for the @xmath26he nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we apply this definition of @xmath24 to all the nuclei having the atomic mass @xmath38 , for which a sufficient amount of experimental data is known .",
    "these are the data of the present work and of our previous works on the nuclei @xmath31li @xcite , @xmath26he @xcite and @xmath39c @xcite . besides , from ref .",
    "@xcite , we have used the experimental data obtained at the saclay and bates laboratories for @xmath26he , @xmath39c , @xmath40ca , @xmath41ca , @xmath42fe .",
    "the momentum transfers @xmath24 derived from these data are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath24 values of the nuclei @xmath26he , @xmath40ca , @xmath41ca , @xmath42fe are grouped at @xmath43  @xmath3 , and in the case of @xmath0li and @xmath1li - at @xmath44  @xmath3 . for the @xmath39c nucleus",
    "we have @xmath45 @xmath3 .",
    "the momentum @xmath24 grouping of the nuclei , observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , corresponds to their distribution over the cluster isolation parameter @xmath4 defines the degree , to which the clusters are formed within the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 value varies from @xmath46 ( shell model , e.g. , @xmath26he ) to @xmath47 ( limiting case of the cluster model ) . ] .",
    "the first - group nuclei are not clusterized , whereas the second - group nuclei are strongly clusterized .",
    "thus , for the @xmath0li nucleus , the parameter @xmath4 varies between 0.3 and 0.4 @xcite , while for @xmath1li we have @xmath48 @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "we arrive at understanding of the intermediate ( between the two groups ) value @xmath45  @xmath3 of the @xmath39c nucleus , because this nucleus is though clusterized but to a less degree than the nuclei of the lithium isotopes . for the @xmath39c nucleus , the parameter @xmath4 ranges from 0.7 to 0.8 @xcite .",
    "let us consider the momentum @xmath24 as a function of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "for this purpose we put the cluster isolation parameter of the nuclei @xmath26he , @xmath40ca , @xmath41ca , @xmath42fe to be equal to 1.0 . as is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath24 is close to linear , this being in agreement with the result of fitting the straight line to all the data with the least @xmath49 value . note that the observed dependence displays a high sensitivity of @xmath24 to the @xmath4 value .",
    "after refinement of @xmath50 values for the nuclei of lithium isotopes . ] , this feature of the function considered might be used for determination of @xmath4 from the @xmath24 value . however , because of the laborious procedure of obtaining experimental coulomb sums , this method would be hardly applicable in practice .",
    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows .",
    "* experimental values of the nuclei @xmath0li and @xmath1li have been obtained at momentum transfers @xmath37  @xmath3 and @xmath51  @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "this has essentially extended the range of the measured towards @xmath9 values lower than those investigated in refs .",
    "* using the data of the present work and of works @xcite , the momentum transfer @xmath24 has been determined for the @xmath1li nucleus ( @xmath52  @xmath3 ) , and has been redetermined more exactly for the @xmath0li nucleus ( @xmath53  @xmath3 ) .",
    "the analysis of the available literature data on the coulomb sums for @xmath26he , @xmath39c , @xmath40ca , @xmath41ca , @xmath42fe has yielded the @xmath24 values for the mentioned nuclei ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) . * the momentum transfers @xmath24 of @xmath31li nuclei",
    "have been found to be much lower than those in the case of other nuclei .",
    "the comparison of the present experimental data with the data obtained elsewhere for a number of nuclei has demonstrated the validity of the hypothesis of the manifestation of nuclear cluster structure in the coulomb sum of the nucleus .",
    "the effect manifests itself in the observable proportionality of the momentum transfer @xmath24 to the cluster isolation parameter @xmath4 , which characterizes the degree of nuclear clusterization . besides",
    ", the hypothesis under discussion might be also supported provided that the coulomb sums were measured for the @xmath54be nucleus at @xmath55  @xmath3 , from which the momentum @xmath24 of this nucleus can be derived . since the parameter @xmath56 @xcite , related to the @xmath54be nucleus , lies between the @xmath4 values of the nuclei @xmath31li and @xmath39c , i.e. , in the range from 1.3  @xmath3 to 1.6  @xmath3 ."
