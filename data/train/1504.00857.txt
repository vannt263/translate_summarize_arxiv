    "rare earth ions are ubiquitous in many technologies such as solid - state lasers , amplifiers for optical telecommunication , and magnetic materials .",
    "they have also played a central role in the development of high - resolution laser spectroscopy methods such as hole burning and photon echo  @xcite .",
    "transitions to the lowest lying excited states of an isolated rare earth ion take place within its 4f - shell and are dipole - forbidden . in a solid matrix , however , these transitions become weakly probable with long excited - state lifetimes up to milliseconds . furthermore , because the 4f - intrashell electrons are well shielded by the outer electrons , they are less sensitive against the environment resulting in long spin coherence times of the order of hours  @xcite . in addition , they possess transitions at various wavelengths in the visible and near infrared , where optical detectors are very sensitive .",
    "furthermore , they are optimally photostable even at room temperature and high excitation powers .",
    "the combination of the above - mentioned features makes rare earth ions also very appealing for emerging applications in quantum information processing .",
    "here , one would often like to access quantum states of well - defined spin via optical interactions and have the possibility of storing qubits for long times .",
    "in fact , a number of interesting effects have recently been demonstrated in rare earth - doped bulk crystals such as the robust adiabatic population transfer  @xcite , storage of light in a spin - wave using the atomic frequency comb technique  @xcite and storing images in an ion ensemble by electromagnetically induced transparency for one minute  @xcite .    for the ultimate control of quantum states at the levels of single material and light particles ,",
    "however , it is desirable to detect and manipulate single rare earth ions .",
    "however , although rare earth ions were on the wish list of single particle microscopy and spectroscopy since the mid 1980s , this goal was only very recently achieved  @xcite .",
    "room - temperature detection of single emitters in the condensed phase requires extremely low concentrations so that neighboring particles are separated by more than the spatial resolution of the imaging system . under cryogenic conditions , however , one can address individual emitters by tuning the frequency of a narrow - band laser through the inhomogeneous band of the sample even if the concentration is higher by a few orders of magnitude . in this scheme , every time an emitter becomes resonant with the excitation light , it fluoresces .",
    "this signal can be detected on a low background because the other emitters in the excitation volume do not absorb light at that frequency . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we employed this method pioneered by w.e .",
    "moerner and m. orrit for the detection of single molecules  @xcite to detect single pr@xmath3 ions in y@xmath4sio@xmath5 ( yso ) . as illustrated in the energy level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : scans](a ) , we used the transition at a wavelength of 488 nm ( blue ) .",
    "the figure shows an example of the excitation spectra of several individual ions over 4 ghz .    because of a limited access to samples with suitable concentration , in that work we used yso nanocrystals to keep the background fluorescence to a manageable level . the spectral diffusion caused by the cracks and surface defects in these samples resulted in the broadening of the resonances from the lifetime - limited linewidth of 82 khz to several mhz .",
    "as a result , the hyperfine levels of the excited state could not be resolved .",
    "furthermore , the weak signal of only tens of photon counts per second prevented us from performing various studies , which we now present in this article . in our current work",
    "we have increased our signal level beyond 500 counts per second ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scans](a ) ) by using a single photon counting module ( spcm ) with a higher quantum efficiency .",
    "this leads to faster measurement times and a @xmath6-fold improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",

    ", the @xmath8p@xmath9 state can directly decay into @xmath8h@xmath10 and @xmath8f@xmath4 levels or relax via the @xmath11d@xmath4 state , which decays into the crystal field levels of the @xmath8h@xmath12 ground state .",
    "( b ) same as in ( a ) but with the excitation laser tuned to the transition from the lowest crystal field level at @xmath2 nm .",
    "the scan speed was @xmath13mhz / s .",
    "the measured fluorescence is collected at @xmath14 nm which corresponds to a decay into higher crystal field levels of @xmath8h@xmath12 .",
    "the polarization of the excitation light was rotated by @xmath15 with respect to the previous blue excitation .",
    "( c ) excitation spectrum of a single ion .",
    "the three hyperfine levels of the mbox@xmath8h@xmath16d@xmath4 state separated by 4.6mhz and 4.8mhz are not resolved . ]",
    "we now provide new spectra recorded in larger yso crystallites ( diameter 1 to @xmath17 m ) with a praseodymium doping level of 0.0001% , which is about 50 times lower than that of the nanocrystals used earlier . as sketched in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow - ion](a ) , the frequencies of three laser beams detuned by the energy differences of the ground - state hyperfine levels are scanned synchronously .",
    "the three peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow - ion](a ) show that the hyperfine levels of the @xmath8p@xmath9 state of a single ion are resolved .",
    "the measured separations of 5.65 and 2.96mhz are in very good agreement with bulk hole - burning spectra presented in our previous publication  @xcite .",
    "a fit to the spectrum composed of three lorentzian functions yields a transition linewidth of 1.3mhz , which is considerably smaller than what we obtained in our former study  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ fig : narrow - ion](b ) reveals that although the fast components of the spectral diffusion have been reduced , a certain level of slow diffusion remains on the time scale of minutes . the fact that the dynamics of transitions to all three hyperfine levels are correlated indicates that the diffusion is not caused by spin instabilities .",
    "in future experiments , we expect to eliminate these fully by adjusting the ion doping levels and further control of the crystal size and quality .",

    "the splitting ordering of @xmath19mhz and @xmath20mhz confirms our previous assignment  @xcite .",
    "( b ) twenty consecutive traces recorded with an integration time of @xmath21s per frequency sample .",
    "to arrive at the spectrum in ( a ) , the scans were manually aligned in frequency to compensate for spectral diffusion between scans .",

    "the great majority of bulk studies on pr : yso have been reported for the transition ( see the level scheme in fig .  [",
    "fig : scans](b ) ) at a wavelength of 606 nm ( red ) with a natural linewidth of about 1 khz  @xcite .",
    "our original motivation for working on the transition was the shorter fluorescence lifetime of the @xmath22 state and , thus , a broader transition , which makes the requirements on the laser linewidth less stringent .",
    "considering that our current state of the art in linewidth is limited to about 1mhz by spectral diffusion , we decided to set up a new dye laser system to see whether it would also be possible to detect single ions via the transition .",
    "as in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , sidebands at @xmath23mhz and @xmath24mhz were added to the center excitation laser frequency to prevent shelving of the population in other hyperfine levels of the ground state .",
    "furthermore , we employed a longpass filter designed for @xmath25 nm with a @xmath7 nm edge to suppress the excitation light .",
    "figure  [ fig : scans](b ) shows an example of sharp resonances obtained when sweeping the frequency of the excitation laser over 4 ghz , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : scans](c ) displays a zoom of the excitation spectrum of a single ion .",
    "these measurements were performed in the very same nanocrystal that was used for our previous work  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the hyperfine levels of the state separated by 4.6mhz and 4.8mhz are not resolved  @xcite .",
    "a robust proof that the fluorescence signal at each resonance stems from a single emitter can only be provided by the observation of strong antibunching in the second - order autocorrelation function @xmath26 of the emitted photons . commonly , the short fluorescence lifetimes of molecules , quantum dots or color centers in the nanosecond regime are comparable with the afterpulsing and deadtimes of spcms . to get around this problem ,",
    "one uses a hanbury brown - twiss configuration and searches for a lack of coincidences on two detectors within short time intervals .",
    "the long lifetimes of the excited states in rare earth ions permit , however , to use a single spcm .",
    "first , we present measurements of the fluorescence lifetime decay . to obtain these data",
    ", we tuned the frequency of the excitation laser beam to a narrow resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scans ] ) and used an aom to pulse the excitation light with pulse duration and repetition period of @xmath17s and @xmath27ms , respectively .",
    "the average laser power was set to achieve 10% of the continuous - wave fluorescence .",
    "the fluorescence was detected with the spcm and the photons were time - tagged with a time - correlated single photon counting system .",
    "figure  [ fig : photonstatistics](a ) displays the fluorescence lifetime curve of the @xmath8p@xmath9 state from a single ion . the red curve shows a double - exponential fit with @xmath28 times of @xmath29s and @xmath30s , which can be attributed to the decay directly from the @xmath8p@xmath9 state and indirectly via the @xmath11d@xmath4 state , respectively .",
    "these findings are in good agreement with the results of bulk studies  @xcite .    figure  [ fig : photonstatistics](b ) shows the same measurement as in ( a ) but for an ion detected on the red transition .",
    "this decay curve was also fitted with two exponentials , yielding @xmath28 times of @xmath31s and @xmath32s although the weight of the contribution with a shorter lifetime only amounted to 4% .",
    "interestingly , the fluorescence lifetime of @xmath32s for the @xmath11d@xmath4 state turns out to be 1.7 times longer than the bulk value and our finding in fig .",
    "[ fig : photonstatistics](a ) .",
    "this difference might be related to the local inhomogeneities of the environment .",
    "access to such variations at the level of individual emitters is one of the fundamental advantages of single - ion spectroscopy .",
    "indeed , we found that the lifetimes vary from ion to ion in the microcrystals .",
    "( color online ) ( a , b ) show the temporal distribution of the photons arrival times from single ions excited at wavelengths of 488 nm and 606 nm , respectively . here",

    "afterpulsing probability was @xmath36 .",
    "the detector deadtime of @xmath37ns only affects the first bin and was omitted for the analysis . since all photons in the time tagged photon collection were used to calculate correlation events , the data are symmetric about @xmath38ms .",
    "the red lines represent fits to the data which are used for normalization and determination of @xmath39.,width=332 ]    to generate clean autocorrelation functions , we removed all photons arriving within @xmath40s of the leading pulse edge and chose time bins of @xmath17s and @xmath41s for the blue and red transitions , respectively .",
    "the center bin at @xmath42 was discarded to remove the majority of the spcm afterpulses .",
    "figure  [ fig : photonstatistics](c ) shows the resulting photon correlation for excitation via the blue transition .",
    "the measured histograms were fitted by a piecewise exponential decay and rise function with baseline , overall peak and zero - peak heights as variable parameters .",
    "the data were further normalized to set the baseline and the peaks of the fit to 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "we note that the data for the blue and the red transitions were not recorded on the same ion ( see section  [ sec : polarization - dependence ] ) .",
    "the measurement on the red channel is somewhat noisier because of a lower fluorescence yield .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath43 and 0.36 are well below @xmath44 , confirming that in each case the fluorescence stems from a single ion .",
    "more importantly , these measurements show that despite the fact that rare earth ions are orders of magnitude weaker than other emitters such as atoms , molecules , quantum dots or color centers , it is possible to study their photon statistics , which is an important quantity for quantum optical investigations .",
    "having demonstrated the feasibility of single - ion spectroscopy on the and transitions , we asked whether it was possible to address the same ion through both channels . here , one might hope to identify the same spectral landscapes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scans ] ) within the inhomogeneous band of the two transitions .",
    "however , after an extended effort , we found no correlation between them .",
    "furthermore , we found that spectral holes burnt in a bulk sample at 488 nm could not be addressed by light at 606 nm and vice versa .",
    "we , thus , suspected that each ion experiences different local electromagnetic environments at the two transition wavelengths .",
    "investigations of the polarization behavior of the two excitation channels shed light on this hypothesis .",

    "we clearly see that the maxima of the two channels are offset by @xmath45 .",
    "the orthogonality of the dipole moments associated with the two transitions implies that they are influenced by different local crystal fields and fluctuations . as a result",

    "the top and bottom maps show the signal upon blue and red excitation , respectively .",
    "the measurements were performed a few micrometers below the surface of a 0.005% doped bulk pr : yso crystal . in each case , the laser was scanned with @xmath46mhz / s .",
    "the zero on the polarization axis was set to align with the d@xmath47 crystal axis.,width=302 ]",
    "next we turn to the emission spectra of single ions .",
    "to record such data , we sent the collected fluorescence to a grating spectrometer equipped with a peltier - cooled em - ccd camera .",
    "the spectra were integrated over 2 seconds and accumulated 800 times , whereby we occasionally corrected for drifts between the laser frequency and the ion resonance .",
    "the fluorescence background was registered by repeating the measurement with the laser frequency detuned from the ion resonance by 50mhz .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the single ion spectra for the blue ( a ) and red ( b ) transitions . considering the weak fluorescence rate and the strong dispersion of the emitted photons in a grating spectrometer , such measurements require long integration times and , thus , a high degree of spectral stability .    to identify the origins of the individual peaks ,",
    "we have also recorded spectra obtained from a bulk sample ( 0.005% pr - doping ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum](c , d ) displays these spectra recorded with optimum excitation polarization for the respective transitions ( see section  [ sec : polarization - dependence ] ) and detection polarizations along the crystal axes d@xmath47 ( cyan ) and",
    "d@xmath4 ( magenta ) .",
    "each peak is attributed to a transition in agreement with previously published data @xcite .",
    "we find a clear correspondence between the single - ion and ensemble measurements for each spectral feature although the relative peak heights differ substantially . here , it is important to note that the emission intensities of different transitions are strongly polarization dependent . in the case of single - ion spectra ,",
    "the arbitrary orientation of the host crystallite and the strong polarization - dependent coupling of the emission into the solid - immersion lens make it difficult to quantify the relative peak heights .",

    "in the present work we have extended our first report on the detection and spectroscopy of single praseodymium ions on the transition to the transition , which has been much more widely studied .",

    "these include the measurement of the fluorescence lifetime , autocorellation function and strong photon antibunching as well as emission spectra of single ions .",
    "finally , we have examined the polarization dependence of the excitation and emission channels and have provided evidence that a given ion experiences different local fields and frequency shifts on its various transitions .",
