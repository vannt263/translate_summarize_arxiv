    "local starburst galaxies are excellent local laboratories to study the physics of galaxy building ( cf .",
    "heckman 1998 ) .",
    "it is now clear that the deposition of mechanical and thermal energy by multiple supernovae in starbursts leads to a global outflow of metal - enriched gas .",
    "these outflows are called `` superbubbles '' during their early dynamical evolution , and `` superwinds '' after they blow out of the galaxy s ism ( e.g. , heckman 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "such flows are expected to play an especially important role in the evolution of dwarf galaxies , whose relatively shallow potential wells make them susceptible to wind - driven loss of gas and newly - created metals ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; martin 1999 ) . since similar outflows appear to be common in high - redshift galaxies as well ( pettini et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; tenorio - tagle et al . 1999 ) they are perhaps the most plausible mechanism by which the mass - metallicity relation in galactic spheroids was established ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1992 ) and the intergalactic medium was heated and chemically - enriched ( e.g. , ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ; gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "one of the major uncertainties concerning starburst - driven outflows is the importance of radiative cooling : what fraction of the kinetic energy supplied by supernovae is carried out in the flow rather than being radiated away ? while the available x - ray data and models establish that radiative losses from hot gas ( @xmath18k ) are not severe ( see strickland & stevens 2000 ) , up until now there has been no direct observational probe of the coronal - phase gas ( @xmath19 to @xmath20 k ) that could dominate the radiative cooling .    the recent launch of the @xmath21 ( @xmath0 - moos et al .",
    "2000 ) provides access to the best probe of rapidly - cooling coronal gas in starburst outflows : the ovi@xmath22@xmath221032,1038 doublet .",
    "accordingly , we have obtained @xmath0 spectra of a small sample of the nearest and brightest starbursts . in this paper , we present the first @xmath0 detection of @xmath11 in the galaxy ngc  1705 .",
    "ngc  1705 is an ideal test - case for the study of coronal - phase gas .",
    "this nearby ( d = 6.2 mpc ) dwarf starburst galaxy has the second highest vacuum - ultraviolet flux of any starburst galaxy in the extensive compilation of iue spectra in kinney et al .",
    "the detailed investigation by meurer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) established ngc  1705 as a prototypical example of a dwarf starburst undergoing mass - loss .",
    "they were able to delineate a kpc - scale fragmented ellipsoidal shell of emission - line gas that was expanding at roughly 50 km s@xmath5 along our line - of - sight .",
    "they also showed that the population of supernovae in the young super star cluster ( ngc  1705 - 1 ) was energetically - sufficient to drive this flow .",
    "the expulsive nature of the flow was later confirmed by @xmath23 observations that showed that the ultraviolet interstellar absorption - lines towards ngc  1705 - 1 were blueshifted by 70 to 80 km s@xmath5 relative to the galaxy systemic velocity ( heckman & leitherer 1997 ; sahu & blades 1997 ; sahu 1998 ) .",
    "hensler et al . (",
    "1998 ) reported the detection of soft x - ray emission , presumably from hot gas inside the expanding emission - line nebula .",
    "two @xmath0 observations of ngc1705 ( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ) were obtained on 4 - 5 february 2000 .",
    "the central super star cluster ngc  1705 - 1 was centered in the large ( lwrs , @xmath26 ) aperture of the lif1 ( guiding ) channel for each observation by the standard guide - star acquisition procedure .",
    "the two observations resulted in 13 exposures totaling 21.3 @xmath27 of on - target exposure time .",
    "approximately 95% of the observing time occurred during orbital night , which greatly reduced the amount of terrestrial and airglow entering the fuse apertures .",
    "flux was recorded through the lwrs apertures in both long wavelength ( lif , @xmath28 ) channels and both short wavelength ( sic , @xmath29 ) channels .",
    "the astigmatic heights of the lif1 spectra near 1030  were roughly 1/3 of the aperture width , consistent with the compact photometric structure of ngc  1705 .",
    "images at 2200  show that roughly 40% of the light that would be admitted into the @xmath0 lwrs aperture would come from the single brightest star cluster ngc  1705 - 1 , and 70% of the light would come from the region within a radius of 2.8 arcsec of ngc  1705 - 1 ( meurer et al 1995 ) .",
    "a comparison of the hst @xmath30 ( 1.7 arcsec aperture ) and @xmath31 ( 10 by 20 arcsec aperture ) spectra implies that these fractions should not be strongly wavelength dependent .",
    "thus , while the @xmath0 data sample the entire inner region of ngc  1705 ( projected size of roughly 900 by 900 pc ) , the sightlines within about 80 pc of ngc  1705 - 1 are very strongly weighted . ]",
    "the data are preserved in the @xmath0 archive with observation identifications a0460102 and a0460103 .",
    "the raw time - tagged photon event lists for each exposure were processed with the standard @xmath0 calibration software ( @xmath32 ) available at the johns hopkins university as of august 2000 .",
    "the lists were screened for valid data , and corrections for geometric distortions , spectral motions , and doppler shifts were applied ( see sahnow et al .",
    "the data were not affected by the detector event bursts that plagued many of the early fuse spectra .",
    "the 13 individual calibrated extracted spectra for each channel were cross - correlated , shifted to remove residual velocity offsets due to image motion in the apertures , and combined to a produce composite spectrum for each channel .",
    "these composite spectra in the 10001070  region were then compared , and any remaining velocity offsets were removed by referencing to the lif1 channel data .",
    "the wavelengths were put into the local standard of rest ( lsr ) reference frame by requiring that the galactic ism lines fall at @xmath33 km  s@xmath5 , the approximate velocity of the milky way lines as observed at longer wavelengths with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the @xmath34 .",
    "these new stis data will be presented in future papers ( sembach et al .",
    "2001 ; heckman et al 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 data have a wavelength uncertainty of @xmath35 km  s@xmath5 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  1705 is shown in figure 1 .    in this article",
    ", we do not combine the data from all four channels because the instrumental resolution and sensitivity changes as a function of wavelength .",
    "therefore , when measuring the strengths of absorption features , we compare the individual measurements ( w@xmath37 ) for the two channels having the highest sensitivity at the wavelengths of the absorption features of interest ( usually lif1 and lif2 for @xmath38  , or sic1 and sic2 for @xmath39  ) .",
    "the integrated equivalent widths derived from separate channels generally agree very well .",
    "table  1 contains these measurements for selected milky way and ngc1705 absorption features observed along the sight line .",
    "the data have a velocity resolution of @xmath40 km  s@xmath5 and s / n ratios of 16 , 13 , 10 , and 9 per resolution element at 1032   in the lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , and sic2 channels , respectively .",

    "we confirm the principal conclusion of sahu & blades ( 1997 ) and sahu ( 1998 ) : there are three separate systems of interstellar absorption - lines along the sight - line to ngc  1705 ( table 1 ; figure 2 ) .",
    "these arise in the milky way , the periphery of the high velocity cloud hvc  487 , and the interstellar medium of ngc  1705 . in the present paper",
    ", we will focus our analysis on ngc  1705 , but briefly summarize our results on hvc  487 .      as pointed out by sahu & blades ( 1997 ) , hvc  487",
    "is located 2@xmath41 away from the ngc  1705 sight - line .",
    "sahu ( 1998 ) proposes that hvc  487 is associated with the magellanic stream , so the implied impact parameter would be roughly 2 kpc .",
    "the properties of the absorption associated with hvc  487 will be discussed in detail in a future paper which will combine the @xmath0 data with echelle spectra taken with stis on @xmath23 ( sembach et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    ", we note only that hvc  487 is strongly detected in absorption in the @xmath81032 , @xmath42977 , @xmath431036 , and lyman - series lines . assuming that the @xmath81032 line is optically - thin , the implied @xmath11 column is 2.0@xmath440.3 @xmath2 10@xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this is typical of other hvc sight - lines studied with @xmath0 ( sembach et al .",
    "the lyman series , ciii@xmath22977 , and cii@xmath221036 absorption - lines from hvc  487 are at @xmath47 = 270@xmath4415 km s@xmath5 .",
    "these are close to the @xmath4821 cm velocity of hvc  487 of 232@xmath4414 km s@xmath5 ( sahu 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath81032 line is centered at @xmath47 = 326@xmath4410 km s@xmath5 , an offset of 94@xmath4417 km s@xmath5 from the @xmath4821 cm velocity .",
    "the @xmath11 line is very broad , with an observed fwhm = 100@xmath4415 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this breadth is comparable to the sound speed in coronal gas where @xmath11 would be abundant , and is similar to those of other @xmath11 hvcs observed with @xmath0 ( sembach et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we expect our @xmath0 data to probe four phases of interstellar gas in ngc  1705 : molecular gas , neutral atomic gas , warm gas photoionized by hot stars , and collisionally - heated coronal gas .",
    "the neutral atomic gas is traced by species with ionization potentials of creation @xmath49 1 ryd , the warm gas by ions with @xmath50 = 1 to 4 ryd ( up to the heii edge ) , and the coronal gas by ions with @xmath514 ryd .",

    "relative to @xmath67 , the centroid of the @xmath70 line is blueshifted by 95@xmath4420 km s@xmath5 . the blueward edge of the line is blended with the hvc feature , but absorption extends to at least -260 km",

    "the hi@xmath2221 cm maps of ngc  1705 published by meurer et al ( 1998 ) show emission from -94 to + 86 km s@xmath5 relative to @xmath67 .",
    "the velocity range of the _ redshifted _ gas seen in @xmath431036 is thus consistent with the kinematics of the normal neutral ( turbulent ? ) ism , but an additional component of highly blueshifted ( outflowing ) neutral gas is also present .",
    "we have determined column densities by converting the observed absorption profiles into optical depth profiles and integrating over velocity ( see savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "we measured only the weaker ( and thus , more - optically - thin ) metal lines with equivalent widths @xmath71 250 m . the results are given in table 2 .",

    "the absolute abundances are uncertain by 0.3 dex . with the exception of nitrogen , the abundances are marginally consistent with the metallicity of [ o / h]=-0.9 derived for the nebular emission - line gas ( heckman et al .",
    "this is in agreement with expectations that we see ambient interstellar gas , rather than the much hotter gas that is polluted by recent supernova ejecta .",
    "we confirm sahus ( 1998 ) finding of a low relative @xmath72 abundance , based on the @xmath73 column density .",

    "unless most of this is associated with the @xmath84 phase , @xmath72 remains selectively underabundant .",
    "in fact , most of the observed @xmath83 must be associated with the warm photoionized gas that dominates the total gas column along our line - of - sight ( see below ) .",
    "this is implied by the kinematics of the @xmath861084 line , which has a significantly larger blueshift and fwhm than the lines arising in the neutral phase , but agrees with the other lines arisiing in the warm photoionized gas ( table 1 ; and see above ) .",
    "a low nitrogen abundance is typical of low - metallicity gas in dwarf galaxies , and is a consequence of a partly secondary nucleosynthetic origin for @xmath72 ( e.g. van zee , haynes , & salzer 1997 ) .",
    "we do not confirm the low relative @xmath87 abundance noted by sahu & blades ( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , we see no evidence for the systematic gas - phase depletion of refractory elements ( e.g. compare @xmath87 to @xmath88 ) .",
    "the neutral gas in the outflow thus appears largely dust - free ( e.g. , savage & sembach 1996 ) , consistent with the lack of detectable reddening in the uv spectrum of ngc  1705 ( e.g. , meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 ) .",
    "the total column density in the warm photoionized gas is more uncertain .",

    "the detection of the interstellar @xmath11 absorption - line ( the first in a starburst galaxy ) is the most important result in this paper .",
    "we will organize our discussion of the coronal gas in ngc  1705 as follows .",
    "we begin by making some simple inferences about the basic physical properties of the gas that are independent of any specific model for the origin of the gas (   4.5.1 ) . in particular , in ",
    "4.5.2 we point out that - independent of the detailed thermal / dynamical history of the gas - the observed @xmath11 column density and line width imply that we are observing gas that has been heated to @xmath146 and which then cools radiatively .",
    "these model - independent results can then be used to constrain the radiative cooling rate from the coronal gas and show that it is small compared to the supernova heating rate .",
    "we then turn our attention to specific models for the @xmath11",
    ". we will not exhaustively consider all the possible alternative models ( for example , conduction fronts associated with either the supershell fragments or the hi clouds discussed above ) .",
    "instead we will describe the shortcomings of the standard superbubble model (   4.5.3 ) , and then consider what we regard as an especially plausible alternative model in which the @xmath11 arises in a hydrodynamical interaction between hot outrushing gas and the dense , cooler fragments of the superbubble shell during the `` blow - out '' phase .",
    "this idea is considered analytically in  4.5.4 in the context of models of turbulent mixing layers , and then using numerical hydrodynamical models in  4.5.5 .",
    "the combination of a detection of blueshifted @xmath81032 in absorption and an upper limit to corresponding redshifted emission allows us to place an upper bound on the density and pressure in the coronal gas ( since we know the column density , and have an upper limit to the emission - measure ) .",
    "this calculation only assumes reasonable symmetry between the front and back sides of the outflow averaged over the kpc - scale projected @xmath0 aperture .    the @xmath11 ion is abundant only over a rather narrow temperature range ( e.g. sutherland & dopita 1993 ) , so we will assume @xmath9 3@xmath210@xmath3 k. the upper limit to the extinction - corrected @xmath81032 flux in the @xmath0 aperture corresponds to an upper limit to the @xmath11 intensity of @xmath14710@xmath148 photons @xmath46 s@xmath5 ster@xmath5 .",
    "following shull & slavin ( 1994 ) , our observed @xmath11 column density then leads to an upper limit to the electron density in the coronal gas of @xmath149 0.1 @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding upper limit to the pressure is @xmath15010@xmath10 k @xmath129 .",

    "we note that the isobaric condition could be invalidated by the presence of a dynamically - significant magnetic field ( in which case the thermal pressure in the coronal gas should be higher than in the denser photoionized material ) .",
    "however , our model - independent upper bound of @xmath15010@xmath10 k @xmath129 in the coronal gas is only a factor of three higher than the pressure implied by an assumption of isobaric conditions . for @xmath9 3@xmath210@xmath3",

    "1998 ) the implied radiative cooling time from @xmath9 3@xmath210@xmath3 k is @xmath154 = 1@xmath210@xmath155 years ( interpolating between the collisional - ionization - equilibrium models for different metallicities in sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "the assumption of collisional - ionization - equilibrium is probably reasonable for @xmath11 , since the relevant recombination times at our assumed density and temperature ( nahar 1999 ) are roughly an order - of - magnitude less than the radiative cooling time .",
    "the estimated column density in the coronal gas in ngc  1705 is @xmath410@xmath156 @xmath46 , so the above density implies a characteristic thickness for the absorbing material of @xmath4 100 pc . if this path length is contributed by @xmath72 total clouds , the sound crossing time of a cloud is @xmath157 years .",

    "1998 ) is significantly smaller than our estimate of @xmath164 , and is therefore negligible .",

    "thus , the cooling column can also be written at @xmath169 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath170 is independent of density , since @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , at coronal temperatures the cooling is dominated by metals , so @xmath172 ( where @xmath173 is the metallicity ) . since @xmath174 , the characteristic @xmath11 column density in radiatively cooling coronal gas is essentially independent of density and metallicity and depends only on the value for @xmath168 .",

    "this does not appear to be feasible in ngc  1705 , since the minimum required shock speed ( post - shock temperature ) is @xmath4 150 km s@xmath5 ( 3@xmath188 k ) - see shull & mckee ( 1979 ) and dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is significantly higher than the expansion speed measured in for the shell in ngc  1705 : @xmath4 53 km s@xmath5 , corresponding to a post - shock temperature of only 40,000  k.    second , thermal conduction will transfer heat from zone @xmath113 to zone @xmath114 and create coronal - phase gas at the interface ( zone @xmath189 ) .",

    "we therefore consider a plausible alternative model .",
    "we have argued above that that the superbubble in ngc  1705 is in the process of breaking out of the ism of ngc  1705 . during this phase ,",
    "the expansion speed of the superbubble shell accelerates and rayleigh - taylor instabilities will cause the shell ( zone @xmath114 ) to fragment .",
    "this allows the hot x - ray emitting gas in zone @xmath189 to push its way out through the fragmented shell , and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities are believed to lead to the turbulent mixing of this hot outrushing gas with the cooler shell fragments ( e.g. maclow , mccray , & norman 1989 ) .",

    "these values could be adjusted upward in tmls with larger values for @xmath194 and @xmath204 . in terms of the arguments in   4.5.2 , the low @xmath11 columns in the tml models are partly attributable to the small relevant flow velocity in the tml : @xmath206 10 km s@xmath5 .",

    "fractional ion abundances as a function of temperature were taken from sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) , which assume collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "this a reasonable assumption in the case of @xmath11 ( see above ) .",
    "it is also a reasonable mock - up of @xmath83 ( in reality , photoionization by stars in ngc  1705 keeps the gas containing @xmath83 near @xmath9 10@xmath10 , close to the temperature floor of 1.6 @xmath210@xmath10 k in the simulations ) .",
    "much of the uv light in ngc  1705 comes from the compact central star cluster , but a significant fraction comes from a more diffusely spread component ( meurer et al 1995 ) .",
    "the width of @xmath231 fuse aperture used corresponds to a projected width of @xmath232 pc at the distance of ngc 1705 , so the observed spectrum is a sum over many slightly different lines of sight . to investigate the effect of this on the simulated absorption line profiles we explored two cases , which should bracket the real situation . in the first case we assumed",
    "all the light comes from a single point - like source at the center of the galaxy , and in the second case that the light comes from uniform surface brightness disk of radius @xmath233 pc .",
    "we found very little difference in the simulated absorption line profiles between the two methods , and so quote only results using the point - like light source .",
    "for any particular model , the column densities and kinematics of the gas vary strongly between different sight lines , due to the structural complexity that arises in 2-d simulations ( see suchkov et al .",
    "1994 , strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "the total column densities ( in either @xmath11 or @xmath83 ) do not change systematically with time in these simulations .",
    "we find that the mean and variance in total column density is the same before , during and after blow - out , considering all 12 simulated lines of sight at each specific epoch .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , we find @xmath11 column densities in the range @xmath234 in the low metallicity models ( @xmath235 ) , and @xmath236 in the solar metallicity model . only about 10% of the lines - of - sight in the low metallicity models have @xmath11 columns comparable to the observed value in ngc  1705 .",
    "one reason for the failure of these simulations to reproduce the observed ovi column densities may be that there is insufficient numerical resolution to resolve the cooling zones between hot and cool gas , where the ovi - absorbing gas exists . evidence to support",
    "this idea comes from comparing the predicted column densities in the fiducial model with those in the high resolution model .",
    "although the predicted columns for low ionisation species always agree to within a factor 2 , the predicted ovi column densities agree to within a factor 2 in only 50% of the sight lines , with the remaining sight lines differing by a factor of up to 30",
    ". the lack of thermal conduction in these models may also be partially responsible for the low ovi columns , although the arguments presented in ",
    "4.5.3 suggest thermal conduction alone can not produce the observed ovi columns .",
    "our simulations do show that the column density of lower ionization material is considerably higher than that of coronal material , and that this phase contains most of the mass in the outflow ( consistent with our observations ) .",
    "the column - weighted mean velocities for the coronal gas along the different sight - lines generally lie in the range @xmath237 to @xmath238 km s@xmath5 , although the full range covers @xmath239 to @xmath240 km s@xmath5 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this gas is typically more blue shifted , and has a wider range of outflow velocities , than the cooler gas in our simulations .",
    "for example , the typical velocity range for @xmath83 is @xmath241 to @xmath238 km s@xmath5 and the full range seen only covers @xmath242 to @xmath243 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the velocity range covered appears very similar in both low and solar metallicity models , so it appears that the kinematics of the gas in these simulations is independent of the metal abundance . for @xmath11 , the mean outflow velocity ( and range of velocities ) ,",
    "does appear to increase with time , moving from pre - blow - out through to post - blow - out .",
    "this is not the case for lower ionization species , e.g. the distribution of mean velocity for @xmath83 is very similar at all three epochs .    in summary ,",
    "while the numerical models underpredict the @xmath11 columns , they _ can _ explain one aspect of the observed data on ngc  1705 .",
    "the mean outflow velocity of high - ionization gas probed by @xmath11 is as high as , or higher than , that of low - ionization gas .",
    "this is in contrast with the standard superbubble model in which the outflow speed in the coronal gas ( zone @xmath189 ) is less than that of the superbubble shell .",
    "this result supports the idea that blow - out is responsible for the kinematics of the coronal phase in ngc  1705 .",
    "as summarized in   1 , probably the greatest uncertainty in assessing the impact of starburst - driven outflows on the evolution of dwarf galaxies is the importance of radiative cooling ( which will directly determine the outflow s dynamical evolution ) . in the absence of severe radiative cooling ,",
    "both analytic arguments and hydrodynamical simulations imply that outflows like the one in ngc  1705 will easily blow - out of their galaxy s ism ( e.g. , maclow & mccray 1988 ; marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ; martin 1998,1999 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "the hot gas that blows out of the superbubble will then be able to heat and chemically enrich the inter - galactic medium ( e.g. , ponman et al .",
    "1999 ; tozzi , scharf , & norman 2000 ) and/or an extended gaseous halo surrounding the dwarf galaxy ( silich & tenorio - tagle 1998 ) .",
    "we will not repeat these arguments here , but simply note that within the context of the standard mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) formalism , the lack of radiative cooling would be a result of the exceedingly high supernova rate per unit volume , which leads to a porosity near unity in the ism ( i.e. , the ism within which the supernovae detonate is filled almost entirely with hot , diffuse gas ) .",
    "this is especially pertinent to ngc  1705 , in which nearly half of the supernovae will detonate inside the pc - scale super - star - cluster ngc  1705 - 1 .",
    "existing x - ray data establish that radiative cooling from hot ( @xmath244k ) gas is energetically insignificant in ngc  1705 ( hensler et al .",
    "1998 ) and other starburst galaxies ( cf .",
    "heckman 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the new data from @xmath0 are very instructive , since they directly probe for the coronal - phase ( @xmath245 k ) gas near the peak of the cooling curve where hitherto - unobserved radiative cooling might be severe . as we showed in   4.5.2 above",
    ", the observed @xmath11 column density ( @xmath246 @xmath46 ) and flow speed ( @xmath13 km s@xmath5 ) implies that we are seeing gas in the outflow that has been heated to @xmath247 k and then radiatively cooled .",
    "we have estimated that the implied rate of radiative cooling is only @xmath46% of the rate of supernova heating (   4.5.2 ) .",
    "thus , there is no place left to hide the radiation necessary to quench the supernova - driven outflow in ngc  1705 .",
    "what then is the fate of the outflowing gas ? for an isothermal gravitational potential that extends to a maximum radius @xmath248 , and has a virial velocity @xmath249 , the escape velocity at a radius @xmath250 is given by :    @xmath251^{1/2}\\ ] ]    the rotation curve for ngc  1705 implies @xmath249 = 62 km s@xmath5 ( meurer et al . 1998 ) , and the rotation curve remains relatively flat out to the last measured point at @xmath250 = 7 kpc .",
    "thus , the minimum escape velocity at the present location of the superbubble wall ( @xmath252 0.5 kpc ) will be roughly 170 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the velocities of most of the outflowing gas that we observe in - absorption in ngc  1705 .",
    "thus , there is no direct evidence that most of this material will escape ngc  1705 .",
    "maps of the hi in ngc  1705 ( meurer et al .",
    "1998 ) show that the large - scale ism in ngc  1705 will not be strongly affected by the outflow ( which will only puncture a few - kpc - scale hole in the central region of the hi disk ) .",
    "on the other hand , the bulk of kinetic energy and most of the newly - created metals will reside in the hotter gas that is driving the superbubble s expansion .",
    "the temperature of this gas will be @xmath253 k ( della ceca et al .",
    "1996,1997 ; hensler et al .",
    "we have argued that we are witnessing the blow - out phase in ngc  1705 in which this gas is vented through the fragmented superbubble wall .",
    "following blow - out , in the absence of significant radiative cooling this hot gas will feed a galactic wind with a terminal velocity of at least 300 km s@xmath5 ( chevalier & clegg 1985 ) .",
    "this is comfortably above @xmath254 for any plausible value for @xmath248 .",
    "once the hot gas vents out of the ruptured superbubble , there is no known external medium to impede the resulting high - speed wind .",
    "we conclude that ngc  1705 can eject most of the newly - created metals and kinetic energy returned by the central starburst over the past @xmath4 10@xmath117 years . if typical of dwarf starbursts , this process could help create the low metal abundances in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; lyden - bell 1992 ) and contribute to the heating and chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( ponman et al .",
    "1999 ; gibson et al . 1997",
    "; ellison et al .",
    "we have presented new @xmath0 far - uv spectroscopy of the prototypical dwarf starburst galaxy ngc  1705 .",
    "previous optical and uv spectroscopy has established that the starburst in this galaxy is driving a large - scale outflow ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 ; marlowe et al .",
    "the @xmath0 data are especially important because they probe the coronal - phase ( @xmath9 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath155 k ) gas that may dominate the radiative cooling of the outflow , and thereby largely determine its dynamical evolution . the high quality of the data ( spectral resolution of @xmath4 30 km s@xmath5 and a @xmath255 16 ) gives us important new insight into all the phases in the ism of this galaxy .",
    "firstly , we do not detect any @xmath53 , with an upper limit of @xmath256 14.6 .",
    "this is similar to the results obtained by vidal - madjar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the dwarf starburst izw18 . in the specific case of ngc  1705",
    "the low @xmath53 abundance is consistent with galactic sight - lines with similarly low @xmath59 ( savage et al . 1977 ) .",
    "we do detect absorption from three other phases of the ism : neutral gas , warm photoionized gas , and coronal - phase gas ( probed with the @xmath81032 line ) .",
    "the total column densities ( @xmath46 ) in the three phases are @xmath257 = 20.2 , 20.9 , and @xmath25819.0 respectively .",
    "the first is directly measured from lyman series , while the latter two are estimated from the measured ionic columns assuming a metal abundance of 12% solar ( as measured in the optical emission - line gas ) .",
    "all the interstellar absorption - lines associated with ngc  1705 are broad ( @xmath4 10@xmath207 km s@xmath5 ) and blueshifted .",
    "thus , gas is flowing out of ngc  1705 with @xmath259 = -32 , -53 , and -77 km s@xmath5 for the neutral , photoionized , and coronal gas respectively .    the mass and kinetic energy in the outflowing gas probed by @xmath0 is dominated by the warm photoionized gas , which is also seen via its optical line - emission .",
    "the size , morphology , outflow speed , mass , kinetic energy , and dynamical age of this structure are all consistent with a simple model of an adiabatic superbubble whose expansion is driven by a piston of hot gas created by the cumulative effect of the supernovae in the starburst ( e.g. , weaver et al . 1977 ) .    in contrast , we have shown that the neutral gas must reside in relatively small dense clumps in order to be optically - thick in the lyman continuum .",
    "we attribute the outflowing material to clouds in the ism that have been overtaken by the superbubble and accelerated by the outflowing hot gas .",
    "the properties of the coronal gas probed with @xmath81032 are inconsistent with the predictions of the simple superbubble model . the observed expansion speed of the superbubble ( 53@xmath4410 km s@xmath5 ) is too small to produce @xmath11 behind its shock - front .",
    "the blueshift of the @xmath11 line is larger than that of superbubble shell ( while the model predict that it should be substantially smaller ) . finally , the observed @xmath11 column ( @xmath176 = 14.3 ) is a factor of @xmath415 too large compared to the superbubble model ( in which such gas arises in a conductively - heated and adiabatically - cooled interface between hot gas and the cool outer superbubble shell ) .",
    "we therefore proposed the following origin for the @xmath11 absorber , and have investigated its plausibility via numerical hydrodynamical models .",
    "the morphology and relative size - scale of the superbubble implies that it has begun to `` break out '' or `` blow out '' of the ism in the disk of this galaxy . during the blow - out phase ,",
    "the superbubble shell will accelerate and then fragment ( e.g. , maclow & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "as it fragments , the piston of hot gas inside the superbubble will flow out through the `` cracks '' , and the resulting hydrodynamical interaction between this outrushing gas and the shell fragments will create intermediate - temperature coronal gas that can produce the observed @xmath11 absorption ( e.g. , slavin et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this process accounts nicely for the observed kinematics of the @xmath11 absorption .",
    "we also emphasized that for the observed flow speed of @xmath13 km s@xmath5 , the observed @xmath11 column density is just what is expected for gas that has been collisionally - ionized and then radiatively - cooled , independent of its density or metallicity and independent of any specific hydrodynamical model ( edgar & chevalier 1986 ) .",
    "we have argued that the coronal gas should be in rough pressure - balance with the warm photoionized gas ( whose pressure we determined to be @xmath260 k @xmath129 ) .",
    "this allowed us to estimate cooling rates of @xmath40.07 @xmath14 per year and @xmath410@xmath15 erg s@xmath5 in the coronal gas , based on the @xmath11 absorption - line .",
    "independent of the gas pressure , the lack of redshifted @xmath11 _ emission _ from the backside of the outflow implies upper limits to the cooling rates of @xmath2610.3 @xmath14 per year and @xmath262 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the rate of radiative cooling due to hotter ( @xmath244 k ) gas is negligible in comparison ( hensler et al .",
    "1998 ) . since the rate of supernova - heating in ngc  1705 is @xmath263 erg s@xmath5 ( marlowe et al . 1999 ) , we have argued that radiative cooling is not dynamically important in the ngc  1705 outflow .    in the absence of significant radiative cooling ,",
    "the superbubble in ngc  1705 should be able to blow out of the ism .",
    "based on the relatively low outflow velocities , it is unlikely that the absorption - line gas we observe with @xmath0 will escape from the galaxy .",
    "likewise , the bulk of the global ism ( @xmath84 ) in ngc  1705 will be retained ( cf .",
    "de young & heckman 1994 ; maclow & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "however , we have argued that the hotter gas that drives the outflow ( and which is now being vented out of the ruptured superbubble ) can escape and thereby carry away most of the kinetic energy and newly - created metals supplied by the starburst .",
    "this process has potentially important implications for the evolution of both dwarf galaxies and the igm .",

    "<S> we report @xmath0 far - uv spectroscopy of the prototypical dwarf starburst galaxy ngc  1705 . </S>",
    "<S> these data allow us for the first time to directly probe the coronal - phase ( @xmath1 = few @xmath210@xmath3 k ) gas that may dominate the radiative cooling of the supernova - heated ism and thereby determine the dynamical evolution of the starburst - driven outflows in dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a broad ( @xmath4100 km s@xmath5 fwhm ) and blueshifted ( @xmath6@xmath7 = 77 km s@xmath5 ) @xmath81032 absorption - line arising in the previously - known galactic outflow . the mass and kinetic energy in the outflow we detect </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by the warm ( @xmath9 10@xmath10 k ) photoionized gas which is also seen through its optical line - emission . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of this warm gas are compatible with a simple model of the adiabatic expansion of a superbubble driven by the collective effect of the kinetic energy supplied by supernovae in the starburst . however , the observed properties of the @xmath11 absorption in ngc  1705 are _ not _ consistent with the simple superbubble model , in which the @xmath11 would arise in a conductive interface inside the superbubble s outer shell . </S>",
    "<S> the relative outflow speed of the @xmath11 is too high and the observed column density ( @xmath12 14.3 ) is much too large . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the superbubble has begun to blow out of the ism of ngc  1705 . during this blow - out phase the superbubble shell accelerates and fragments . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting hydrodynamical interaction as hot outrushing gas flows between the cool shell fragments will create intermediate - temperature coronal gas that can produce the observed @xmath11 absorption . for the observed flow speed of @xmath13 km s@xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath11 column density is just what is expected for gas that has been heated and which then cools radiatively . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the coronal - phase gas is in rough pressure balance with the warm photoionized gas , we estimate a cooling rate of - order @xmath40.1 @xmath14 per year and @xmath410@xmath15 erg s@xmath5 in the coronal gas . </S>",
    "<S> the latter represents @xmath1610% of the supernova heating rate . </S>",
    "<S> independent of the assumed pressure , the lack of observed redshifted @xmath11 emission from the backside of the outflow leads to upper limits on the cooling rate of @xmath17 20% of the supernova heating rate . since the x - ray luminosity of ngc  1705 is negligible , we conclude that radiative - losses are insignificant in the outflow </S>",
    "<S> . the outflow should therefore be able to fully blow - out of the ism of ngc  1705 and vent its metals and kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> this process has potentially important implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies and the igm . </S>"
