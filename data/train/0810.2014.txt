    "a number of extraordinary magnetotransport phenomena of irradiated two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons in very high landau levels ( lls ) , especially the microwave - induced resistance oscillation ( miro ) and the zero - resistance state , has been the focus of intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies in the past few years .    under the irradiation of a moderate microwave of frequency @xmath0 ,",
    "the most striking resistance oscillations show up in the linear photoresistivity as a function of the inverse magnetic field @xmath1 , featuring the periodical appearance of peak - valley pairs around @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath4 the electron effective mass ) .",
    "the cyclotron resonance and its harmonics are node points of peak - valley pairs , where the photoresistivity vanishes . in addition ,",
    "secondary peak - valley pairs were also observed in the linear resistance near certain fractional values , @xmath5 , and 3/2 .",
    "these fractional microwave - induced resistance oscillations were referred to real multiphoton participating processes.@xcite they were also referred to higher harmonic effect,@xcite the resonant series of consecutive single - photon transition,@xcite or microwave - induced sidebands.@xcite despite different scenarios have been proposed for these fractional miros of linear photoresistivity , they have so far been theoretically demonstrated to clearly appear in a real system only within the multiphoton - assisted scattering model.@xcite    another notable effect recently discovered is the significant role of a dc current .",
    "a relatively weak current alone , without microwave radiation , can also induce substantial magnetoresistance oscillations and zero - differential resistance states.@xcite simultaneous application of a finite dc current and a microwave radiation leads to very interesting and complicated oscillatory behavior of resistance and differential resistance.@xcite these facts clearly indicate that microwave - irradiated nonlinear magnetotransport is remarkably different from the linear one .",
    "so far experimental and theoretical investigations on nonlinear miros have been carried out in the magnetic field range lower than the cyclotron resonance and never anticipated any anomaly elsewhere .",
    "very recent experiments by hatke _",
    "@xcite disclosed sharply distinct nonlinear transport behavior in the subharmonic fields of the cyclotron resonance .",
    "particularly , they found that at the second cyclotron resonance subharmonic , @xmath6 , the differential resistivity oscillates as a function of the current density in the same way as that at the cyclotron resonance , @xmath6 , despite a factor of two difference in magnetic fields .",
    "in other words , at @xmath6 the frequency of the resistivity oscillation with the magnetic - field - normalized current - density is twice that at the cyclotron resonance and its harmonics .",
    "this is in vast contract with the observed behavior of the resistivity oscillations in the magnetic field regimes of cyclotron resonance and its harmonics ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a nonlinear theoretical analysis capable of identifying the specific mechanism responsible for fractional miros and frequency doubling is highly desirable .",
    "this paper presents such an analysis on microwave - induced nonlinear magnetotransport in high landau levels in gaas - based 2d heterosystems . with the microscopic balance - equation scheme",
    "direct controlled by the current , we are able to constitute a unified description for both the cyclotron resonance harmonic and subharmonic regimes of the magnetic fields and predict the resistivity oscillations with applied current density in excellent agreement with the experimental observation in both regimes .",
    "our examination is based on a current - controlled scheme of photon - assisted transport,@xcite which deals with a 2d system of short thermalization time having @xmath8 electrons in a unit area of the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane .",
    "these electrons , subjected to a uniform magnetic field @xmath11 in the @xmath12 direction and scattered by random impurities and by phonons in the lattice , perform an integrative drift motion when an incident microwave electric field @xmath13 irradiates on and a current flows in the plane . in terms of the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) momentum and coordinate defined as @xmath14 and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the momentum and coordinate of the @xmath18th electron in the 2d plane , and the relative electron momentum and coordinate @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the hamiltonian of this system can be written as the sum of a c.m .",

    "@xmath26 is the in - plane component of the vector potential of the perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the dc and ac components of the uniform electric field inside , @xmath4 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the electron effective mass parallel and perpendicular to the plane , @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the confined and coulomb potentials .    the separation of the electron hamiltonian into a c.m .",
    "part and a relative electron part amounts to look at electrons in the reference frame moving with their center of mass .",
    "the most important feature of this separation is that a spatially uniform electric field shows up only in @xmath21 , and that @xmath22 is the hamiltonian of a many particle system subject to a magnetic field _ without the electric field_. this enables to deal with the relative electrons in the magnetic field _ without tilting the landau levels_.    we proceed with the heisenberg operator equations for the rate of change in the c.m . velocity @xmath32 $ ] : @xmath33 $ ] , and that of the relative electron energy @xmath22 : @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "coordinate @xmath35 and velocity @xmath36 in these equations can be treated classically , i.e. , as the time - dependent expectation values of the c.m . coordinate and velocity , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 . in the case of the steady transport under a modest radiation of single frequency @xmath0 it suffices to assume that the c.m .",
    "velocity , i.e. , the electron drift velocity , consists of a dc part @xmath40 and a stationary time - dependent part of the form @xmath41    for high mobility and high carrier density 2d systems at low temperatures where effects of electron - impurity and electron - phonon scatterings are weak in comparison with internal thermalization of this many electron system , it is a good approximation to carry out the statistical average of the above operator equations to leading orders in @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for this purpose",
    "we only need to know the distribution of relative electrons without being perturbed by @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the distribution function of the system described by hamiltonian ( [ her ] ) without electric field , is an isotropic fermi - type with a single temperature @xmath42 .",
    "such a statistical average of the above operator equations yields the following force and energy balance equations in the steady state : @xmath43 @xmath44 in this , @xmath45 is the time - averaged damping force against cm motion , @xmath46 is the time - averaged rate of the electron energy - gain from the ac field , having an expression obtained from eq.(6 ) by replacing @xmath47 factor by @xmath48 . in eq.([exf0 ] ) , @xmath49 is the effective impurity potential , @xmath50 is the bessel function of order @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the imaginary part of the electron density correlation function at electron temperature @xmath42 in the presence of the magnetic field , and @xmath53 .",
    "the argument in @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "note that , although contributions of phonon scattering to @xmath56 and @xmath46 are neglected here , it provides the main channel for electron energy dissipation to the lattice with a time - averaged energy - loss rate @xmath57 , having the expression as given in ref ..    the ac components @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the electron drift velocity should be determined selfconsistently from the incident ac field @xmath60 by the maxwell equations connecting both sides of the 2d system , taking account the scattering - related damping forces @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite however , for the high - mobility systems at low temperatures , the effects of these scattering - related forces are much weaker than that of radiative decay @xcite and always negligible , hence @xmath58 and @xmath59 are directly determined by the setup of the 2d system in the sample substrate.@xcite    the effect of interparticle coulomb interaction is included in the density correlation function to the degree of electron level broadening and screening ( considered in the effective impurity and phonon potentials ) . the remaining @xmath63 function in eqs.([exf0 ] ) is that of a noninteracting 2d electron gas in the magnetic field , which can be written in the landau representation as @xcite @xmath64\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,\\hspace{2cm}\\times\\,\\,{\\rm im}g_n(\\varepsilon + { \\it \\omega})\\,{\\rm im}g_{n'}(\\varepsilon ) , \\label{pi_2ll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the magnetic length , @xmath66^{-1}y^l{\\rm e}^{-y}[l_n^l(y)]^2 $ ] with @xmath67 the associate laguerre polynomial , @xmath68 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function at electron temperature @xmath42 , and @xmath69 is the density - of - states ( dos ) function of the broadened landau level @xmath51 .    the ll broadening results from impurity , phonon and electron - electron scatterings . in the experimental ultraclean gaas - based 2d systems having mobility higher than @xmath70m@xmath71/vs",
    "the dominant elastic scatterings come mainly from residual impurities or defects in the background rather than from remote donors,@xcite and phonon and electron - electron scatterings are generally also not long - ranged because of the screening . on the other hand ,",
    "since the microwave - induced magnetoresistance oscillations occur at low temperatures and low magnetic fields in high electron density samples , the cyclotron radius of electrons involving in transport is generally much larger than the correlation length or the range of the dominant scattering potentials . in this case",
    ", the broadening of the lls is expected to be a gaussian form [ @xmath72 is the center of the @xmath51th landau level],@xcite @xmath73 \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] with a @xmath74-dependent half width expressed as @xmath75 in which @xmath76 , the single - particle lifetime or quantum scattering time in the zero magnetic field , depends on impurity , phonon and electron - electron scatterings .",
    "expressions ( [ gauss ] ) and ( [ gamma12 ] ) for the dos of the @xmath51th level will be used in both the separated and overlapped ll regimes .",
    "the total dos of a 2d system of unit area in the magnetic field , @xmath77 , can be written as the sum of the dos without magnetic field , @xmath78 , and a magnetic - field induced oscillatory part .",
    "when the ll widths @xmath79 are much larger than the level spacing @xmath80 ( heavily overlapped lls ) , the oscillatory part is much smaller than @xmath78 and one can keep only its fundamental harmonic component that @xmath81,\\ ] ] with @xmath82.@xcite    a reliable evaluation of single - particle lifetime @xmath76 ( or the ll width @xmath83 ) , which must include effects of impurity , phonon and electron - electron scatterings , has not yet been available .",
    "we treat it as an empirical parameter , or , relate it to the zero - field linear mobility @xmath84 or the transport relaxation time @xmath85 using an empirical parameter @xmath86 by @xmath87 .",
    "these formulations are convenient for current - driven nonlinear magnetotransport of any configuration . for an isotropic system where the frictional force @xmath56 is in the opposite direction of the drift velocity @xmath40 and the magnitudes of both the frictional force and the energy - loss rate depend only on @xmath88 , we can write @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in the hall configuration with velocity @xmath40 in the @xmath9 direction @xmath91 or the current density @xmath92 and @xmath93 , eq.([eqforce ] )",
    "yields the transverse resistivity @xmath94 , and the longitudinal resistivity @xmath95 and differential resistivity @xmath96 at given @xmath97 as @xmath98    in the linear case , the resistivity @xmath96 oscillations ( peak - valley pairs ) result from the resonant real photon - assisted electron transitions between different landau levels .",
    "@xcite we denote a real - photon assisted process in which an electron jumps across @xmath99 ll spacings with the assistance ( emission or absorption ) of @xmath51 photons as @xmath48:@xmath100 , or @xmath51:@xmath99 .",
    "this process contributes , in the @xmath96@xmath101 curve , a pair structure consisting of a maximum and a minimum on both sides of @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the single - photon process @xmath103:@xmath103 , the two - photon process @xmath104:@xmath104 , the three - photon process @xmath105:@xmath105 , ... all contribute to the maximum - minimum pair around @xmath106 ; the two - photon process @xmath104:@xmath103 , the four - photon process @xmath107:@xmath104 , ... all contribute to the maximum - minimum pair around @xmath6 ; the three - photon process @xmath105:@xmath103 , the six - photon process @xmath108:@xmath104 , ... all contribute to the maximum - minimum pair around @xmath109 ; etc . the virtual photon process ( zero - photon process ) during which the electron may absorb ( emit ) one or several photons and then emits ( absorbs ) them before finishing an intra - ll transition ( assuming separated lls for convenience ) , which can be denoted as @xmath110:@xmath110 , gives rise to an overall resistivity suppression without structure . @xcite    the effects of a finite current show up as the energy ( frequency ) shift @xmath111 in the density - correlation function @xmath112 in eq.([exf0 ] ) .",
    "this energy shift indicates that an electron , having momentum @xmath47 and participating in the system integrative drift motion of velocity @xmath40 , carries an extra energy @xmath113 during its transition . in the case of low temperature ( @xmath42 much less than the fermi energy @xmath114 ) and large landau - level filling factor",
    "( @xmath115 ) , the major contributions to the summation in eq.([pi_2q ] ) come from terms @xmath116 , then the function @xmath117 has a sharp principal maximum near @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , as a function of the in - plane momentum @xmath119 , @xmath112 sharply peaks around @xmath120 . as the composite effect of this energy shift , the electron possesses an extra energy @xmath121 for its transition in addition to those provided by photons .",
    "therefore , the resonant condition applied in the linear case for electron scattering across @xmath99 ll spacings with the assistance ( emission or absorption ) of @xmath51 photons , @xmath122 , should change to @xmath123 when the system has an integrative motion of velocity @xmath97 , i.e. , a finite current density @xmath124 .",
    "we can still use symbol @xmath51:@xmath99 to denote this process .",
    "we will also use symbol @xmath51- to represent all the @xmath51-photon participating processes ( electron may jump across any ll spacings ) .",
    "increase in the current density from zero reduces the rates of the scattering processes resonant in the linear case , such as those of zero - photon processes @xmath110:@xmath110 everywhere , of single - photon process @xmath103:@xmath103 and two - photon process @xmath104:@xmath104 at @xmath106 , of two - photon processes @xmath104:@xmath103 and four - photon processes @xmath107:@xmath104 at @xmath6 . but it may increase the rates of the scattering processes originally absent or very small in the linear case , such as those of single - photon process @xmath103:@xmath103 and three - photon process @xmath105:@xmath103 at @xmath6 .    at cyclotron resonance and its harmonics @xmath125 , the resonant condition ( [ reson ] ) can be satisfied only at @xmath126 where the scattering rate peaks and the differential resistivity exhibits maximum .",
    "therefore , at these magnetic fields the @xmath96 oscillation with changing @xmath127 always has a periodicity @xmath128 .",

    "for instance , at @xmath6 , the resonant condition ( [ reson ] ) for zero - photon , two - photon , and four - photon processes ( @xmath131 and 4 ) is satisfied at @xmath132 , indicating these even - photon processes contribute resistivity maxima there . at @xmath133 , on the other hand",
    ", the resonant condition ( [ reson ] ) is satisfied for single - photon and three - photon processes ( @xmath134 and 3 ) , indicating these odd - photon processes contribute resistivity maxima . because of this",
    ", the period of @xmath96 oscillation with @xmath127 may shrink to @xmath135 , or the oscillation frequency doubles , at @xmath6 .    at the third subharmonic field , @xmath109 , in addition to the appearance of resonant scattering of zero - photon and three - photon processes at @xmath136 and 2",
    ", the resonance scattering can also appear at @xmath137 and 5/3 for two - photon processes and at @xmath138 and 5/3 for single - photon processes , leading to possible shrinkage of the @xmath96 oscillation period to @xmath139 , or the frequency tripling .",
    "these analyses are confirmed by the numerical results shown in figs.1 and 2 , where we plot the differential resistivity @xmath96 calculated from eq.([eqdr ] ) as a function of the normalized current density @xmath140 for a gaas - based system of @xmath141m@xmath142 and @xmath143m@xmath144/vs at @xmath145k , irradiated by a @xmath146ghz microwave having incident electric field amplitude @xmath147v / cm .",
