    "a great interest was shown lately towards problems concerning optimal partitions related to some spectral quantities ( see @xcite ) . among them , we distinguish two problems which interest us .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded and connected domain and @xmath1 the set of partitions of @xmath0 in @xmath2 disjoint and open subdomains @xmath3 .",
    "we look for partitions @xmath4 of @xmath0 which minimize    * problem 1 . * : :    the largest first eigenvalue of the dirichlet laplace operator in    @xmath3 :    @xmath5 * problem 2 . * : :    the sum of the first eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplace operator in    @xmath3 :    @xmath6    for simplicity we refer to these two problems in the sequel as minimizing the sum or the max .",
    "theoretical results concerning the existence and regularity of the optimal partitions regarding these problems can be found in @xcite ( and references therein ) . despite the increasing interest in these problems",
    "there are just a few cases where optimal partitions are known explicitly , and exclusively in the case of the max .",
    "[ [ structure - of - the - paper ] ] structure of the paper + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the following section , we apply known results to obtain estimates of the energy of optimal partitions in the case of a disk , a square or an equilateral triangle and recall informations about the structure of an optimal partitions .",
    "then , we focus on the minimization problem for the max : we give explicit results for @xmath7 and in other cases , we present the best candidates we obtained by using several numerical methods . in section  [ sec.compar ] , we recall and apply a criterion which shows when a partition optimal for the max can not be optimal for the sum . in cases where the previous criterion shows that candidates for the max are not optimal for the sum , we propose better candidates in section  [ sec.sum ] .",
    "these candidates are either obtained with iterative methods already used in @xcite or are constructed explicitly .",
    "by monotonocity of the @xmath8-norm , we easily compare the two optimal energies : @xmath9 more quantitative bounds can be obtained with the eigenmodes of the dirichlet - laplacian on @xmath0 . for @xmath10 , we denote by @xmath11 the @xmath2-th eigenvalue of the dirichlet - laplacian on @xmath0 ( arranged in increasing order and repeated with multiplicity ) and by @xmath12 the smallest eigenvalue ( if any ) for which there exists an eigenfunction with @xmath2 nodal domains ( _ i.e. _ the components of the nonzero set of the eigenfunction ) . in that case",
    ", the eigenfunction gives us a @xmath2-partition such that the first eigenvalue of the dirichlet - laplacian on each subdomain equals @xmath13 .",
    "we set @xmath14 if there is no eigenfunction with @xmath2 nodal domains .",
    "it is standard to prove ( see @xcite for example ) : @xmath15 let us consider @xmath16 . since the first eigenvalue of the dirichlet - laplacian is simple and @xmath0",
    "is connected , then necessarily any eigenfunction associated with @xmath11 has one or two nodal sets whether @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "consequently @xmath19 for @xmath16 and @xmath20 furthermore , any nodal partition associated with @xmath11 is optimal for the max when @xmath16 .",
    "we say that an eigenfunction associated with @xmath21 is _ courant - sharp _ if it has @xmath2 nodal domains with @xmath22 .",
    "+ in this paper , we focus on three geometries : a square @xmath23 of sidelength @xmath24 , a disk @xmath25 of radius @xmath24 and an equilateral triangle @xmath26 of sidelength @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenvalues are explicit and given in table  [ tab.vp ] where @xmath27 is the @xmath28-th positive zero of the bessel function of the first kind @xmath29 and @xmath11 is the @xmath2-th element of the set @xmath30 . in table  [ tab.estim ] , we explicit the lower and upper bounds in .                   this work is supported by a public grant overseen by the french national research agency ( anr ) as part of the `` investissements davenir '' program ( labex _ sciences mathmatiques de paris _ anr-10-labx-0098 and anr _ optiform _ anr-12-bs01 - 0007 - 02 ) .",
