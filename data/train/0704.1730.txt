    "one of the earliest studies of latin bitrades appeared in @xcite , where they are referred to as _ exchangeable partial groupoids_. later ( and at first independently ) , latin bitrades became of interest to researchers of critical sets ( minimal defining sets of latin squares ) ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) and of the intersections between latin squares ( @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , latin bitrades may be applied to the compact storage of large catalogues of latin squares .",
    "results on other kinds of combinatorial trades may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that a latin bitrade may be thought of as a set of three permutations with no fixed points , whose product is the identity and whose cycles have pairwise at most one point in common . by letting a group act on itself by right translation ,",
    "in this paper we extend this result to give a construction of latin bitrades directly from groups . this construction does not give every type of latin bitrade , however the latin bitrades generated in this way are rich in symmetry and structure .",
    "furthermore latin bitrade properties such as orthogonality , minimality and homogeneity may be encoded concisely into the group structure , as shown in section 3 .",
    "section 4 shows that many interesting examples can be constructed , even from familiar examples of groups . finally in section 5",
