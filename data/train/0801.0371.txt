    "over the past several decades , significant progress has been made on both theoretical and observational fronts in understanding the nature and origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , those with @xmath6 eev ( @xmath7 ev ) ( for recent reviews , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . yet , the acceleration mechanism and the corresponding astrophysical  accelerators \" of these energetic particles are still largely unknown .",
    "observational data from several experiments such as the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) indicate that the mass composition of uhecrs becomes lighter at higher energies @xcite",
    ". however , composition analyses that include high energy interactions are often model - dependent and inconclusive @xcite .",
    "according to a recent report from the pierre auger observatory , the mass composition is likely mixed , possibly becoming heavier above 30 eev @xcite .",
    "the overall distribution of uhecr arrival directions is considered to be consistent with isotropy @xcite .",
    "exceptions to this general isotropy include the small - scale clusterings of doublets and triplets found in data collected by the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , a possible correlation of agasa events with bl lacertae objects has been suggested @xcite . but",
    "these claims have been confirmed neither by hires @xcite nor by auger @xcite .",
    "however , the auger collaboration recently reported that the arrival directions of uhecrs above @xmath8eev in their data show a correlation with the position of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) lying within 75 mpc @xcite .    since protons with @xmath6 eev",
    "can not be confined within the galactic plane , uhecrs likely originate from extragalactic sources .",
    "in particular , the overall isotropy of arrival directions suggests that there may be a large number of sources distributed over cosmological distances @xcite . during their propagation through intergalactic space",
    ", such protons will lose energy by means of pion and pair production processes while interacting with the cosmic background radiation @xcite .",
    "the flux of ultra - high - energy ( uhe ) protons from cosmological sources is thus expected to be strongly attenuated , resulting in a significant suppression in the observed spectrum above the gzk threshold energy , @xmath9 eev @xcite . although the agasa data show no indication of the gzk suppression @xcite , both the yakutsk extensive air shower array and hires have reported a suppression of flux above @xmath10 , contradicting the agasa finding @xcite .",
    "indeed the same suppression was seen in a recent auger measurement @xcite , which seems to have ended the controversy over the presence of the gzk cutoff .",
    "the so - called dip - calibrated uhecr spectra from different experiments compiled by @xcite , appear to be in good agreement with each other and to be consistent with gzk suppression .",
    "however , it has yet to be understood whether this suppression is actually due to the gzk cutoff or due to the maximum acceleration energy , @xmath11 , of astrophysical accelerators .",
    "if uhecrs are protons , the gzk energy loss should operate at acceleration sites as well , leading to an @xmath11 close to @xmath10 ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "most uhe protons observed above the gzk energy must come from within the so - called gzk sphere of radius @xmath12 mpc , although the proton interaction length at @xmath10 is @xmath13 gpc , corresponding to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "however , finding cosmological sources inside the gzk sphere from the arrival directions of uhecrs is not straightforward , since their paths are deflected by intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sigl and collaborators have extensively studied the propagation of uhecrs in a structured and magnetized universe , adopting a numerical model for the igmfs @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the igmfs are generated by means of the biermann `` battery '' mechanism at shocks and then evolved passively in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation @xcite .",
    "the strength of the resulting fields is rescaled to match the simulated field strength in coma - like clusters to the observed strength , which is on the order of microgauss .",
    "uhecrs with @xmath15eev are then injected at cosmological sources .",
    "these particles propagate through the magnetized large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe , and arrive at a mock observer with deflection angle @xmath16 , the angle between the arrival direction and the source s location on the sky .",
    "sigl  found that the deflection due to igmfs is significant , with @xmath17 above 100 eev . on the other hand ,",
    "dolag  adopted an igmf model from a `` constrained '' cosmological simulation employing a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) version of a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "they found the deflection angle of protons with 100 eev to be less than @xmath18 , contradicting the estimate by sigl  @xcite .",
    "this controversy over the predicted deflection angles demonstrates the importance of modeling the igmfs in identifying the astrophysical sources and studying the origin of uhecrs . in order to reexamine this issue ,",
    "here we adopt igmfs , based on a novel models of the turbulence dynamo @xcite in this model , the strength of the magnetic fields is estimated from the local vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy in cosmological structure formation simulations . for the field direction ,",
    "the passive fields from these simulations are used .",
    "the maximum energy of nuclei of charge @xmath19 that can be confined and accelerated by astrophysical sources is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the characteristic flow speed , magnetic field strength , and linear size of the accelerator , respectively @xcite .",
    "there are a few viable candidates that can produce the required @xmath24 eev : jets from agns @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and cosmological shocks @xcite . in this study",
    ", we consider agns inside galaxy clusters as the sources of uhecrs .",
    "thus , the source position is in effect correlated with the lss of the universe .",
    "protons with @xmath25eev are injected at the sources and travel through the simulated magnetized space until they lose energy down to 10 eev , meanwhile visiting mock observers placed inside groups of galaxies . in this study",
    "we focus mainly on the deflection angle , the time delay relative to rectilinear flight , and the energy spectrum of the uhe protons .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model igmfs , cosmic - ray sources , and observers , and the simulations of the propagation of uhe protons in intergalactic space .",
    "the results are presented in  3 .",
    "finally , we conclude in  4 .",
    "our cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of a concordance @xmath26cdm universe are carried out with the following parameters : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.7 , and @xmath31",
    ". a cubic box of comoving size @xmath32 is simulated using @xmath33 grid zones for gas and gravity and @xmath34 particles for dark matter . in the simulation , magnetic fields",
    "are generated through the biermann battery mechanism at structure formation shocks and then evolved passively with the flow motions @xcite .",
    "the simulation was repeated for six different realizations of the initial conditions to examine the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "non gravitational effects , including radiative cooling , photo ionization and heating , and feedback from star formation are ignored .",
    "those processes affect the generation and evolution of magnetic fields mainly on small scales @xcite , which should not alter the large - scale fields primarily responsible for the deflection of uhecrs .    in principle ,",
    "if we were to perform full mhd simulations , we could follow the growth of the igmfs through stretching , twisting , and folding of field lines , the process known as the turbulence dynamo . in practice , however , the computational resources currently available do not allow high enough numerical resolution to reproduce the full development of mhd turbulence : since the numerical resistivity is larger than the physical resistivity by many orders of magnitude , the growth of the magnetic fields saturates before the dynamo action becomes fully operative @xcite .",
    "so , @xcite rescaled the strength of their passively evolved fields in the postprocessing analysis to match the observed field strength in clusters of galaxies .",
    "this rescaling , which hinges on the observed field strength in the intracluster medium , does not necessarily result in correct field strengths for filaments , sheets , and voids . on the other hand , in the mhd sph simulations of @xcite ,",
    "the initial field strength was adjusted to obtain a microgauss level in clusters of galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "they demonstrated that their simulated cluster fields are consistent with various observations , such as rotation measure profiles and the total radio powers of cluster halos .",
    "a lack of observations , however , prevents their simulated fields in low - density regions from being tested against the real magnetic fields in filaments and sheets . in the mhd sph simulations ,",
    "the flow motions can be resolved reasonably well in high - density regions , where the smoothing length is sufficiently small , ensuring adequate growth of magnetic fields .",
    "however , turbulence may not be fully realized in the low - density regions , which have large smoothing lengths , so the field strength in filaments and sheets may be underestimated in such simulations .    in this study , we take a new approach detailed in @xcite . if one assumes that magnetic fields grow as a result of the turbulence dynamo , their energy density can be estimated from the eddy turnover number and turbulent energy density as follows : @xmath35 here the eddy turnover time is defined as the reciprocal of the vorticity at driving scales , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the conversion factor from turbulent to magnetic energy , which is determined from high - resolution mhd simulations of turbulence . for our model igmfs ,",
    "the number of eddy turnovers is estimated as the age of the universe multiplied by the magnitude of the local vorticity , that is , @xmath39 .",
    "the local vorticity and turbulent energy density are calculated from the cosmological structure formation simulations . the energy density given by equation ( 2 )",
    "fixes the strength of the igmfs , so our model requires neither rescaling of the field strength nor adjustment of the initial fields . as in the work of sigl , we assume that the topology of the igmfs in the lss can be represented statistically by the topology of the passive magnetic fields in the cosmological simulations .",
    "figure 1 shows a two - dimensional slice of the magnetic field strength in our model at the present epoch .",
    "the igmfs are structured and well correlated with the weblike cosmic distribution of matter .",
    "the strongest magnetic fields , with @xmath40 g , are found inside and around clusters , while the fields are weaker in filaments , sheets , and voids .",
    "overall , there is a correlation between field strength and gas density , as can be seen in figure 2(_left _ ) . in the regions of galaxy clusters , with @xmath41 ,",
    "we find @xmath42 g . for typical filamentary regions , with @xmath43 , the field has @xmath44 g. by comparison , the average field strength in filaments is found to be @xmath45 g by @xcite and @xmath46 g by @xcite .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows the volume fraction , @xmath47 ( _ solid line _ ) , and its cumulative distribution , @xmath48 ( _ dotted line _ ) and @xmath49 ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) . in our model ,",
    "the volume filling factor for @xmath50 is @xmath51 . by comparison ,",
    "@xmath52 in @xcite and @xmath53 in @xcite .",
    "hence , the field strength in filaments in our model lies in the middle of the values from the models used by these two groups , that is , lower than sigl s but higher than that of dolag s .      in the framework of bottom - up acceleration models ,",
    "agns are the most studied candidate astrophysical accelerators to produce cosmic - ray nuclei beyond the gzk energy ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as noted in ",
    "i , it has also been suggested that cosmological shocks may accelerate nuclei of charge @xmath19 up to an @xmath11 of a few times @xmath54 ev , but it is unlikely that protons would be accelerated beyond the gzk energy by such shocks @xcite .",
    "however , if some uhecrs are iron nuclei , cosmological shocks can provide the acceleration sites for super - gzk cosmic rays @xcite . in this paper , we consider only agn - like objects as sources of uhecrs , since we focus on the propagation of uhe protons .",
    "we identify x - ray clusters characterized by the x - ray emission weighted gas temperature @xmath55 kev in the cosmological simulations as source locations .",
    "one agn is placed at the center of each `` host '' cluster . with this selection criterion ,",
    "the source locations are chosen , in effect , at high - density regions with the strongest field strength .",
    "table 1 shows the number of such clusters found in the six cosmological simulations ( @xmath26cdm1-@xmath26cdm6 ) with different initial conditions .",
    "the three - dimensional distribution of the 18 sources in @xmath26cdm1 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "given the simulation volume of @xmath56 , the mean separation of sources is @xmath57 and the source number density is @xmath58 , which is consistent with the required uhecr source density inferred from the small - scale clustering found in the agasa data @xcite .",
    "the field strength at the source locations mostly lies in the range @xmath59 , with a peak at @xmath60 g ; its distribution is shown in figure 4 ( _ left _ ) .",
    "the key physical condition for an `` observer '' that is most relevant to this study is the strength and direction of the magnetic fields , since we are interested primarily in the deflection angles and time delays of uhecrs .",
    "little is known about the magnetic fields in the intergalactic space within the local group .",
    "so , we select groups of galaxies identified in the simulation data that have similar halo gas temperatures to the local group , that is , @xmath61 @xcite , assuming that these groups are located in magnetic environment similar to that of the local group",
    ". there are about @xmath62 identified groups with gas temperatures in this range inside the simulation volume ( see table 1 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure 3 , these groups are not distributed uniformly but are located mostly along filaments , following the matter distribution of the lss .",
    "a mock observer , modeled as a sphere of radius @xmath63 , is placed at each group .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is chosen so that the observer s sphere is well contained within the associated filament , since the typical thickness of the magnetized region around a filament is about @xmath65 . if we were to use an @xmath64 smaller than the value adopted , smaller cross sections would lead to smaller detection rates of cosmic rays in our numerical experiment described below .",
    "the right panel of figure 4 shows the field strength within the observer spheres for the six cosmological simulations : @xmath66 with a peak at @xmath67 g. this illustrates the distribution of magnetic field strength in filaments .",
    "the characteristics of the particle spectrum accelerated at uhecr sources are largely unknown .",
    "we thus make the simple assumption that the accelerated protons have a power - law energy spectrum at their source : @xmath68 for 10 eev @xmath69 eev . in practice , @xmath70 is used to generate a flat injection spectrum at the sources , and later a weighting factor proportional to @xmath71 is applied to the statistics ( except for the distribution in fig . 5 ; see  3.1for details ) . for each @xmath26cdm simulation , a total of @xmath72 particles",
    "are randomly distributed over the sources and then launched in random directions from random positions inside a sphere of radius @xmath73 .",
    "we follow the trajectories of the uhe protons by numerically integrating the equations of motion in our model igmfs , @xmath74 the energy losses due to photo pion production and pair production are treated with the continuous loss approximation @xcite , but the adiabatic losses due to cosmic expansion are ignored , because the largest source - to - observer distance is @xmath75 gpc in our experiment , corresponding to only @xmath76 . in practice , the distances are not known in advance , since we are integrating the trajectory from sources to observers .",
    "the simulation box of @xmath56 at @xmath77 is used to define sources ( host clusters ) , mock observers ( groups ) , and the igmf data .",
    "additional virtual boxes with the same distribution of mock observers and igmf data are periodically stacked indefinitely .",
    "particles are injected from the sources only in the original box .",
    "then they travel through the magnetized space consisting of the original box and the replicated periodic boxes .",
    "once a particle visits an observer sphere , the arrival direction , time delay and energy of the particle are registered as a `` recorded event . ''",
    "we let the particle continue its journey , visiting several observers during its full flight , until its energy falls to 10 eev . with @xmath78",
    "protons injected for each simulation box , about @xmath79 events are recorded in total for all six @xmath26cdm simulations .    in our propagation experiment ,",
    "the source - to - observer distance @xmath80 can be arbitrarily small because the specific way that we set up source and observer locations , and the statistics of recorded events depend on the minimum value of @xmath80 . in reality ,",
    "the closest agns to us are centaurus a , at 3.42 mpc @xcite , in the southern hemisphere and m87 , at 16.7 mpc @xcite , in the northern hemisphere .",
    "so we mostly present the results for @xmath81 mpc or @xmath82 mpc .",
    "the recorded events with @xmath83 are excluded from the analysis . for @xmath84 mpc ,",
    "however , the results become less sensitive to the value of @xmath85 .",
    "with a gyroradius @xmath86 uhe protons will suffer significant deflection during their propagation when they pass regions with @xmath87 g , that is , clusters and filaments . here",
    "the filamentary regions are more significant players than clusters , since the volume filling factor of filaments is much larger than that of clusters ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . as a result of this deflection ,",
    "the actual path traveled by the uhecrs in the presence of the igmfs can be much longer than a rectilinear path , causing a significant time delay .",
    "we therefore measure the deflection angle as the angle between the arrival direction of the cosmic rays and the source position on the sky , and the time delay as the difference between the arrival time and the rectilinear travel time .",
    "uhe protons can be also deflected inside the host clusters of sources , before they escape to intergalactic space .",
    "typical clusters have a magnetized core envelope structure with @xmath88 g , @xmath89 and @xmath90 g , extending out to @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "so , the protons with @xmath92 injected by agns are scattered by turbulent magnetic fields inside the host clusters and confined within the magnetized structure for a while .",
    "the scatterings by the turbulent fields local to the sources alone can cause a deflection angle @xmath93 for protons with @xmath92 .",
    "figure 5 shows the distributions of the deflection angle @xmath16 and the time delay @xmath94 as functions of the distance @xmath80 for the @xmath26cdm1 simulation .",
    "the events are divided into three channels in observed energy , as follows : @xmath95 ( _ top _ ) , @xmath96 ( _ middle _ ) , and @xmath97 ( _ bottom _ ) , where the particle energy is given in units of eev .",
    "the data points are color - coded by the injection energy in the same three channels , that is , red for @xmath98 , blue for @xmath99 , and green for @xmath100 . for these plots ,",
    "the calculation was performed with an injection spectrum with @xmath101 instead of the flat spectrum , since the recorded data points in this type of representation can not be weighted with a factor proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "sub - gzk protons , with @xmath102 eev , come from sources as distant as @xmath103 gpc .",
    "for these particles , the distribution of @xmath16 shows a pattern roughly in accord with the diffusive transport limit , but it also indicates a bimodality divided at @xmath104 mpc ( fig . 5 , _ top and middle left _ ) .",
    "the events with @xmath105 mpc are likely to be cases in which both the source and observer belong to the same filament . these particles are more likely to travel through strongly magnetized filaments rather than void regions , resulting in large deflection angles in addition to a large @xmath106 given by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the events with @xmath107 mpc the particles come from distant sources associated with different filaments",
    ". some of these may fly through voids and arrive with small @xmath16 , while most are deflected significantly by the igmfs . on the other hand , on average the time delay",
    "tends to increase with distance @xmath80 , as expected .",
    "super - gzk protons , with @xmath108 eev come mostly from within @xmath109 mpc .",
    "most of them from @xmath107 mpc arrive with @xmath110 and @xmath111 yr ( fig . 5 , _ bottom _ ) . since the volume filling factor for @xmath112 greater than a few times",
    "@xmath113 g ( corresponding to @xmath114 mpc ) is small , those particles could travel almost rectilinearly through void regions , avoiding the strongly magnetized regions of clusters and groups .    in figure 6 ,",
    "the distribution of recorded events is shown in the @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) planes .",
    "the events recorded in all six @xmath26cdm simulations are included and @xmath101 and @xmath81 mpc are used .",
    "on average the deflection angle decreases with energy , but a clear transition from the diffusive transport regime to the rectilinear propagation regime is apparent around @xmath117 .",
    "sub - gzk particles , with long interaction lengths and small gyroradii , are strongly scattered , while super - gzk particles , with short interaction lengths and large gyroradii , are much less affected .",
    "as expected , the time delay decreases with increasing energy on average but has a rather wide spread at any given energy . for comparison ,",
    "the rectilinear flight time for the mean separation of sources , @xmath118 40 mpc , is @xmath119 yr .",
    "figure 7 shows the fractions of recorded events in all six @xmath26cdm simulations as functions of @xmath16 and @xmath94 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and their cumulative distributions .",
    "the events are divided into three energy channels as in figure 5 , and each curve is normalized by the total number of events in the corresponding channel . in order to demonstrate the dispersion of the statistics due to cosmic variance",
    ", we also plot the error bars in the cumulative distributions , which are calculated as the standard deviations of the values of @xmath122 for the six simulations .    in the lowest energy channel ( @xmath123 eev , _ red lines _",
    ") , the deflection angle is quite large , with about 70% of the events arriving with @xmath124 , that is , @xmath125",
    ". moreover , with @xmath126 the time delay is much longer than the typical lifetimes of agns ( @xmath127 gyr ) . in the highest energy channel ( @xmath128 eev , _ black lines _ ) , on the other hand , about 70 % of the recorded events arrive with a deflection angle smaller than @xmath1 and a time delay less than @xmath3 yr .",
    "about 35 % arrive with an angle smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the arrival direction of super - gzk cosmic rays may show a positional correlation with the source agns and also with the lss , and the source agns are very likely to still be active for such events .",
    "we note , however , that these results are not restricted to the specific agn model .",
    "they can be applied for any uhecr sources that have a spatial distribution and magnetic field environment similar to those of luminous x - ray clusters .",
    "we note that the present work produces results different from what previous studies have predicted @xcite .",
    "specifically , the deflection angle is smaller than that found by sigl but larger than that of dolag .",
    "this should be attributable to the difference in the models for the igmfs , as discussed in  2.1 .",
    "we also note that the effects of galactic magnetic fields are not included in our analysis .",
    "recently , @xcite , for instance , considered several different models for the galactic magnetic fields and predicted that the deflection angle of @xmath129 ev protons should be greater than 8@xmath130 toward the galactic center , while being mostly @xmath131 outside a circular region of 30@xmath130 radius around the galactic center .      here we present the energy flux , @xmath132 , of the recorded cosmic - ray events in our propagation experiment . by applying a weighting factor proportional to @xmath71 to each recorded particle , the energy spectra for different values of @xmath133 can be constructed .",
    "the predicted spectra are calculated for injection spectra with @xmath133-values of 2.0 , 2.4 , and 2.7 and for @xmath81 and @xmath82 mpc .",
    "again , all data from the six @xmath26cdm simulations are combined .",
    "figure 8 shows the resulting spectra , @xmath134 , along with the data observed at agasa @xcite , hires - i @xcite , hires - ii @xcite , and auger @xcite .",
    "since the amplitude of the injection spectrum is not specified , the amplitude of the predicted @xmath134 is arbitrary in our model .",
    "therefore each curve was adjusted by eye to fit the hires data below @xmath10 .",
    "the presence of gzk suppression above 60 eev is obvious in all the predicted spectra and the observed data except for the agasa data .",
    "the predicted spectra for @xmath135 are all consistent with the observed data , again with the exception of the agasa data .",
    "as shown in the bottom panel of figure 8 , our work predicts that above @xmath136 eev the flux is much higher with @xmath81 mpc than with @xmath82 mpc , indicating that the contribution from nearby sources is important .",
    "thus , if the injection spectrum has a power - law distribution extending well beyond the gzk energy as we assume here , the implication is that the auger experiment , which has centaurus a in its field of view , may see a higher flux of super - gzk cosmic rays , compared with experiments in the northern hemisphere such as hires and the telescope array @xcite .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the injection spectrum is limited to a maximum energy @xmath11 set by the age and size of the astrophysical accelerators or by the gzk energy loss at the acceleration sites .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath11 may vary with the properties of the accelerator , rather than maintaining a constant value of @xmath137 eev .",
    "in order to settle this issue , much better statistics for the energy spectrum and the arrival directions above 100 eev are needed .",
    "in the search for the astrophysical sources of uhecrs , it is important to understand how the propagation of these charged particles is affected by intergalactic magnetic fields in the large - scale structure of the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the information imprinted on the distribution of the uhecr arrival directions may help us to understand the nature of the igmfs and their roles in the formation and evolution of the lss and constituent galaxies .",
    "considering the limitations of current observational techniques in measuring the igmfs in very low density regions such as filaments and voids , it is crucial to construct a physically motivated model to estimate the igmfs in the lss .    in this study , we adopted a new model based on the turbulence dynamo @xcite to predict the strength of the igmfs .",
    "the magnetic field energy is estimated from the local vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy of flow motions in cosmological simulations of the lss formation in a concordance @xmath26cdm universe . for the direction of the igmfs ,",
    "the topology of the passive magnetic fields followed in the cosmological simulations is used .",
    "this approach provides an igmf model that is independent of the initial seed fields and does not require any renormalization to yield the observed field strength in the intracluster medium .",
    "we predict highly structured igmfs with characteristic field strengths on the order of @xmath138 g in clusters of galaxies and @xmath113 g in filaments .",
    "the fields should be much weaker in sheets and voids .",
    "protons with 10 eev @xmath139 eev are injected at the locations of luminous x - ray clusters with @xmath55 kev .",
    "these sources may represent a population of agns residing inside host clusters .",
    "this x - ray temperature criterion naturally places the sources at strongly magnetized regions with @xmath140 g with a comoving density of @xmath141 .",
    "then the propagation of the uhe protons is followed through the structured igmfs , including the energy losses due to interactions with the cosmic background radiation the uhe protons are recorded at the positions of mock observers located in groups of galaxies , with halo temperatures in the range @xmath142 .    below the gzk energy ,",
    "the uhe protons come from sources as distant as @xmath143 gpc .",
    "they are significantly scattered by the igmfs , resulting in a wide range of deflection angles , up to 180@xmath130 , and have time delays ranging from @xmath144 to @xmath145 yr . on the other hand ,",
    "the protons above 60 eev come mostly from sources within @xmath136 mpc .",
    "about 70% of them avoid strong deflection and arrive at the observers within @xmath1 of their source position on the sky with a time delay of less than @xmath3 yr .",
    "about 35% arrive within @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that there may exist a correlation between the arrival direction of super - gzk cosmic rays and the sky position of the corresponding agns .",
    "we thus conclude that in the present scenario , uhecr astronomy may be possible at @xmath146 60 eev .",
    "our prediction seems to be consistent with a recent report by the auger collaboration @xcite in which the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 60 eev in their data were found to be correlated with the sky position of agns within 75 mpc .    for any cosmological sources , we expect to see gzk suppression in the energy spectrum of uhecrs",
    "if the injection spectrum has a power - law distribution and extends well beyond the gzk energy . in this case , nearby sources , within @xmath4 mpc , are expected to make a significant contribution to the flux above @xmath136 eev .    finally ,",
    "as recently reported by auger @xcite , some uhecrs might be heavy nuclei . in the cosmological - shock model , for example , protons can be accelerated up to a few times 10 eev , so heavy nuclei should dominate the particle flux above that energy @xcite . in a future study , we will consider the propagation of heavy nuclei from cosmological sources in our model igmfs , taking into account photo disintegration , photo pair production , and photo pion production processes .",
    "we expect that the propagation of uhe iron nuclei ( @xmath147 ) , at least , will be in the diffusive transport regime as a results of their much smaller gyroradius ( @xmath148 ) @xcite . for intermediate - mass nuclei such as he , c , n , and o , detailed propagation simulations including secondary particles produced by photo disintegrations are necessary in order to determine whether astronomy with uhe nuclei is possible or not .",

    "<S> if ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) originate from extragalactic sources , understanding the propagation of charged particles through the magnetized large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is crucial in the search for the astrophysical accelerators . based on a novel model of the turbulence dynamo , we estimate the intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmfs ) in cosmological simulations of the formation of the lss . under the premise that the sources of uhecrs are strongly associated with the lss </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a model in which protons with @xmath0 ev are injected by sources that represent active galactic nuclei located inside clusters of galaxies . with the model igmfs </S>",
    "<S> , we then follow the trajectories of the protons , while taking into account the energy losses due to interactions with the cosmic background radiation . </S>",
    "<S> for observers located inside groups of galaxies like ours , about 70% and 35% of uhecr events above 60 eev arrive within @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , of the source position with time delays of less than @xmath3 yr . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the arrival direction of super - gzk protons might exhibit a correlation with the distribution of cosmological sources on the sky . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> nearby sources ( within @xmath4 mpc ) should contribute significantly to the particle flux above @xmath5 ev . </S>"
