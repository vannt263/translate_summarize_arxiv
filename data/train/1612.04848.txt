    ", a bright background quasar lies with a small impact parameter behind a foreground galaxy ( most lens galaxies are elliptical ) , and multiple images form due to the gravitational lensing effect . because of the small impact parameter , the quasar light traverses the ism of the lens galaxy , and the cold ism leaves signatures on the lensed quasar spectrum , including reddening due to dust , absorption of the x - ray spectrum , and absorption lines in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical bands .",
    "this method is unique in its ability to probe ism of high density regions deep within the lens galaxy .",

    "possible origins of these lines include metal absorption lines associated with the lens galaxy , our own galaxy , quasar host galaxy , or other ly@xmath1  absorbers along the line of sight .",

    "we have analyzed a cos nuv spectrum of image a of the gravitational lens b1152 + 199 .",
    "we expected to find , based on the absorption seen in the x - ray spectrum , a dla feature at the lens redshift with @xmath39 for image a @xcite .",
    "we can place a 99% upper limit on the neutral hydrogen column density with @xmath57 .",
    "we do detect weak o  i  and c  ii  absorption lines associated with the lens galaxy at a combined significance of 3.5@xmath34 .",
    "b1152 + 199  has been well studied in the optical and x - ray bands , and there are multiple indicators showing that b1152 + 199  contains a large amount of ism , the optical extinction , x - ray absorption , and the presence of mg  ii  and mg  i  absorption lines .",
    "these previous measurements are consistent with our detection of o  i  and c  ii  absorption lines .",
    "the non - detection of the dla feature is surprising , and thus , the lens galaxy of b1152 + 199  is identified as a `` ghostly '' dla , a dla revealed by other absorption features but undetected @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss several possible explanations .",
    "first , it is unlikely that the lens has an extremely high metal - to - gas ratio , such that we only detect absorption signatures from the metals or dusts including the extinction , x - ray absorption , and metal absorption lines .",
    "our 99%  upper limit is four orders of magnitude below the expectation , and such an extreme metal - to - gas ratio is unprecedented .",
    "physically , collisions will always bind and mix the atom / molecules of difference species , and creating a region devoid of hydrogen atoms but with only metals is difficult .",
    "second , it is also unlikely that most hydrogen atoms are in the ionized state because of the signatures of cold ism detected , the o  i , c  ii , mg  i , and mg  ii  lines .",
    "in particular , the ionization potential for mg  i  is 7.64ev lower than that for h  i  ( 13.6ev ) and the ionization potential for o  i  ( 13.62ev ) is comparable to that of h  i , while the o and mg abundances are much lower . the o  i  column density is measured to be @xmath58 for image a , and for solar metallicity , the expected h  i  column density is @xmath59 , three orders of magnitude above our 99% limit .",
    "thus , it is difficult to attribute the weak metal absorbers to a satellite galaxy associated with the lens .",
    "image b has @xmath60 from the x - ray spectrum , and this large amount of ism is consistent with a late - type @xmath56 galaxy and is difficult to explain it in a satellite as well .",
    "a more plausible explanation is that the expected dla absorption trough is filled by the ly@xmath1  emission from the lens galaxy .",
    "@xcite recently reported another ghostly dla system at @xmath61 along the line of sight of a @xmath62 quasar , and the presence of dla was also revealed by other metal absorbers . in this case , the dla and the quasar are very close , and the dla trough is filled by the ly@xmath1  emission from the quasar broad line region .",
    "the authors also assumed that the ghostly dla is falling towards the quasars , which yields an additional redshift such that its measured redshift is larger than that of the quasar . in b1152 + 199 ,",
    "the lens galaxy is well separated from the background quasar , and the trough is presumably filled by the ly@xmath1  emission from the lens galaxy , and thus the ghostly dla in b1152 + 199  represents a different population .",
    "ly@xmath1  emission from dla systems has been detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , usually in the red wing of the dla absorption profile .",
    "the selection method for typical dlas , however , will miss the b1152 + 199-like ghostly dlas .",
    "the ly@xmath1  emission usually has a double - humped emission profile to escape from the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in b1152 + 199  it is possible that the dla trough is filled by the wings of the double - humped emission profile .",
    "depending on the detailed scattering conditions , the two peaks can be separated by up to a few or more gaussian widths ( e.g. , figure5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the total profile can be broad and shallow .",
    "the estimated ly@xmath1  luminosity to fill the absorption trough is @xmath2 , which is close to the break luminosity of the ly@xmath1  emitter luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "higher signal - to - noise ratio and resolution spectrum of b1152 + 199  is needed to investigate the details .",
    "regardless of the explanations , the expected dla is not detected in b1152 + 199 , where a large amount of h  i  is expected .",
    "dlas are important probes to study the baryon distribution in the high redshift universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is important to characterize the statistical properties of the b1152 + 199-like ghostly dlas to evaluate the potential biases introduce by these systems .",
