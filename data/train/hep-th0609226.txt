    "this work initiates a series of articles devoted to the study of conformal field theories reformulated in terms of an extended algebra , in which the algebra is augmented by a simple current .",
    "the extension studied here is that of the diagonal wess - zumino - witten models defined on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these models are unitary , rational conformal field theories parametrised by a non - negative integer @xmath2 called the level . the irreducible ( unitarisable ) representations from which the ( chiral ) conformal field theory is constructed are the level-@xmath2 integrable highest weight modules of @xmath6 @xcite , of which there are @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the corresponding highest weight states by @xmath8 , for @xmath9 , so @xmath10 labels the corresponding @xmath11-weight . among the corresponding primary fields @xmath12 , there is a unique ( non - trivial ) simple current @xmath13 ( when @xmath14 ) , whose fusion rules take the form @xcite @xmath15 this simple current therefore acts as a permutation on the irreducible modules of the chiral theory .",
    "in particular , @xmath16 , the identity .    the construction considered here",
    "consists in augmenting the @xmath6 symmetry algebra of the theory by including the modes of the simple current .",
    "it is actually convenient to consider the corresponding multiplet of _ zero - grade _ descendant fields , rather than just the affine primary , whose corresponding states form an irreducible representation of @xmath11 .",
    "we will therefore enlarge our algebra to include the modes of each zero - grade field @xmath17 , @xmath18 . because these fields each have conformal dimension @xmath1 ( see equation  ( [ eqnhwsconfdim ] ) ) , this augmentation will in general lead to an extended algebra defined by generalised commutation relations .",
    "our aim is to precisely define the structure of this extended algebra .",
    "we note that such an investigation of this extended symmetry algebra has already been carried out for @xmath3 @xcite , under the guise of spinon bases . for higher values of @xmath2 ,",
    "our description differs from the spinon formalism presented in @xcite , in that our algebra is generated by the simple current @xmath19 rather than @xmath20 , whose fusion rules with the different primary fields are more complicated than a simple permutation .",
    "we present here a formalism which applies to the @xmath0 models for all @xmath2 , providing a detailed model for similar treatments of more general extended symmetries .",
    "reformulations of conformal field theories of the type considered here are of particular interest in that they embody a quasi - particle description of the space of states , that is , the states are generated by the repeated action of the simple current modes .",
    "this action is subject to restriction rules that can be interpreted as a generalised exclusion principle .",
    "such quasi - particle reformulations have a number of immediate implications , the most obvious being that they shed new light on the representation theory of the class of models under consideration . in the particular case of the wess - zumino - witten models ,",
    "this translates into a novel point of view on the representation theory of affine lie algebras .",
    "the key point underlying this quasi - particle reformulation is the absence of singular vectors , meaning that the restriction rules are built into the algebraic structure ( the operator product expansions ) of the extended theory .",
    "establishing this very point in the present context is our main result .",
    "it follows that whenever the generating function for the quasi - particles can be found in a closed form , it will take the form of a positive - definite multiple sum , yielding a so - called _ fermionic _ character formula .",
    "we will derive such character formulae in several simple cases .",
    "this contrasts with the usual formulae deduced via the subtraction of singular vectors , leading to the non - positive - definite sums usually referred to as _",
    "bosonic _ character formulae . equating the fermionic and bosonic characters therefore results in non - trivial @xmath21-series identities that are of much combinatorial interest .",
    "these two motivations are clearly rather mathematical in nature . on a more physical note",
    ", we stress that quasi - particle formulations share the underlying spirit of the condensed - matter / particle formalism of conformal field theory , rather than that of the algebraic formalism focussing largely on the representation theory of the chiral algebra .",
    "the quasi - particle interpretation is therefore bound to be better adapted to the study of off - critical perturbations of the theory . in that vein ,",
    "a precise objective is to formulate the problem of computing correlation functions in a way that is suited to the faithful ( free of singular vectors ) description we construct here .",
    "moreover , we expect that it could provide a starting point for the evaluation of off - critical correlation functions . along integrable lines",
    ", these should be governed by integrable differential equations . in brief",
    ", we expect this formulation to allow us to cross the free - fermion barrier in the description of correlation functions as solutions of solitonic equations , and hope to report on this elsewhere .",
    "the extended algebra approach that we outline here was inspired by @xcite , which present a description of the @xmath22 minimal models from the point of view of the extended algebra generated by @xmath23 .",
    "its extension to all minimal models will be reported in @xcite .",
    "the construction of the extended algebra of the @xmath0 wess - zumino - witten models is presented in section  [ secextalg ] . as mentioned above",
    ", this algebra combines the usual affine currents with the @xmath7 zero - grade components of the simple current .",
    "the first issue we address is the question of the mutual locality of these two types of currents . overlooking",
    "this point quickly leads to subtle inconsistencies in the extended theory .",
    "it turns out that these considerations , and in particular imposing a natural definition for the adjoint of the simple current modes , force ( somewhat surprisingly ) the components of this simple current to _ anticommute _ with certain of the affine generators .",
    "this is shown to be compatible with the jacobi identities and forms the conclusion of section [ secalgprelim ] .",
    "the extended algebra is essentially defined by the operator product expansions @xmath24 of the simple current component fields , as the other generators , the affine currents , will be recovered ( roughly speaking ) as bilinears in these fields .",
    "the first step towards computing the different fields appearing in these expansions is to consider the corresponding states .",
    "these are computed for the first few levels , and are expressed directly in terms of the modes of the affine generators in section  [ secalgopes ] .",
    "we then consider the constraints imposed by associativity in section [ secalgassoc ] .",
    "the key point here is to show that the fields of our operator product expansions can be constructed from these states in the usual way ( the state - field correspondence ) .",
    "more precisely , we have to address the following technical issue .",
    "in the analysis of the @xmath22 models in @xcite , it was observed that the operator product expansion corresponding to the fusion rule @xmath25 must necessarily involve an operator @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 .",
    "the question of the potential necessity of a similar operator in the present context is addressed here , but is answered in the negative .",
    "nevertheless , we find it convenient to introduce trivial @xmath26-type operators , denoted by @xmath28 into each of our operator product expansions , whose eigenvalues keep track of various constants that appear in the extended theory .",
    "the trivial nature of these operators reflects the fact that they commute with the modes of the current generators and those of the simple current components",
    ". with these technicalities settled , the path to the formulation of the generalised commutation relations defining the extended algebra is completely paved .",
    "these relations are displayed in section  [ secalggcrs ] .",
    "the representation theory of this extended algebra is developed in section  [ secreptheory ] .",
    "previously , in order to write down the generalised commutation relations , we expanded the simple current components into modes acting on the vacuum module . to formulate this expansion in full generality , we introduce the monodromy charge ( section  [ secrepcharges ] ) . with this tool in hand , the notion of highest weight states for the extended algebra is defined ( section [ secrephwms ] ) , and the verma modules for the extended algebra are constructed from the action of the simple current modes on such a state . within each extended verma module , we readily identify two affine highest weight states .",
    "finally , we evaluate the eigenvalues ( necessary for computation ) of the @xmath29 on these verma modules in section  [ secseigs ] .",
    "we then illustrate the general theory we have developed with two examples , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , worked out in detail ( section  [ secexamples ] ) . when @xmath30 , the dimension of the three components of the simple current is @xmath32 , which suggests a fermionic interpretation .",
    "linear combinations of these three components are readily seen to correspond to three independent free fermions .",
    "it is actually well - known that the affine @xmath33 algebra can be represented in terms of three free fermions @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "15.5.5 and ex .",
    "15.16 ) ) .",
    "we , however , show something more precise : the @xmath30 extended algebra is _ isomorphic _ to the tensor product of three copies of the extended symmetry algebra of the ising model ( defined by its own simple current ) , which is the symmetry algebra of a free fermion . as the spectra ( the highest - weight states ) of the two theories also match , this suggests an equivalence of conformal field theories .",
    "another special case of interest is @xmath31 , for which the extended algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the ( affine ) symmetry algebra of the @xmath34 wess - zumino - witten model at level @xmath35 , sharpening the correspondence @xmath36 @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "17.5.2 ) ) .",
    "however , the comparison of the spectra is more delicate in this case , because we must take the non - diagonal @xmath37 model in this correspondence .",
    "we show that the monodromy charge automatically accounts for this subtlety in our formalism .",
    "the central result of this paper is presented in section  [ secsingvects ] .",
    "it states that the representations of the extended algebras we have constructed are faithful .",
    "in other words , the verma modules have no singular vectors , hence are irreducible .",
    "this result is established in various steps .",
    "first , we demonstrate that not only are there two affine highest - weight states in each extended verma module , but that there are no more than two . for @xmath3 and @xmath30",
    ", we then show explicitly that there are no singular vectors in the ( extended ) verma modules by demonstrating that the primitive singular vectors of the affine algebra vanish identically .",
    "these calculations then motivate the general argument establishing the absence of singular vectors as presented in section  [ secsingvectsgenvan ] .",
    "this allows us to strengthen our conclusions concerning the cases @xmath30 , @xmath5 and their connection to the theory of three fermions and the @xmath38 model respectively .",
    "the isomorphisms , previously established for the symmetry algebras , are now extended to isomorphisms of irreducible modules .",
    "finally , a basis of states is rigorously derived for the two simplest models , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the generating functions for these bases are constructed explicitly and shown to agree with known fermionic expressions for the corresponding characters .",
    "we defer the derivation of the analogous basis of states for general @xmath2 to a sequel @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 models are unitary , rational conformal field theories parametrised by a non - negative integer @xmath2 called the level .",
    "the chiral algebra of these models may be described as follows .",
    "we first define @xcite the ( untwisted ) affine lie algebra @xmath6 associated to the complexification @xmath11 of @xmath39 .",
    "this is the ( graded ) complex lie algebra @xmath40 } \\oplus \\operatorname{span}_{{\\mathbb{c } } } { \\left\\ { k \\right\\ } } { \\mspace{4mu } \\raisebox{-0.11em}{\\reflectbox{\\includegraphics[width=0.7em]{semidirectsum } } } \\mspace{4mu}}\\operatorname{span}_{{\\mathbb{c } } } { \\left\\ { l_0 \\right\\}}\\ ] ] ( @xmath41{semidirectsum } } } \\mspace{4mu}}$ ] denotes a semidirect sum ) whose non - trivial commutation relations are @xmath42 } & = -m j \\otimes t^m \\\\ \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ j^1 \\otimes t^m , j^2 \\otimes t^n \\bigr ] } & = { \\bigl [ j^1 , j^2 \\bigr ] } \\otimes t^{m+n } + m { \\kappa \\bigl ( j^1 , j^2 \\bigr ) } \\delta_{m+n,0 } k. \\end{split}\\ ] ] note that @xmath43 is central . throughout",
    "we will follow the standard practice of abbreviating @xmath44 as @xmath45 . here",
    ", @xmath46 denotes the killing form of @xmath11 , which we normalise so that @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the usual adjoint action of @xmath11 on itself .",
    "the chiral algebra is obtained from the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath6 by dropping @xmath49 ( it will shortly be recovered through the sugawara construction ) and restricting @xmath43 to have eigenvalue @xmath2 . formally , we take the universal enveloping algebra of the derived subalgebra of @xmath6 and form the quotient by the ideal generated by @xmath50 . we denote this chiral algebra by . whilst the name we ascribe an object is largely arbitrary ,",
    "there is much to be said for maintaining consistent notation within a field .",
    "that said however , we prefer to use the more precise notation given above as in the mathematics literature .",
    "the reason why we explicitly indicate the universal enveloping algebra is that our chief object of study is a certain extension of this chiral algebra , and this extension is _ not _ a lie algebra .",
    "we want to treat these extended algebras on an equal footing with more familiar chiral algebras , and so we emphasise chiral algebras as associative algebras , not lie algebras .",
    "the reason for writing @xmath51 rather than @xmath52 is really a matter of taste  @xmath39 does not , strictly speaking , contain the root vectors or coroot that form the most convenient basis for our study . ] @xmath53 .",

    "the normalisation of the killing form then gives @xmath56 the corresponding affine modes are therefore denoted by @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for a given level @xmath2 , the virasoro symmetry is realised as a subalgebra @xmath60 of the chiral algebra through the sugawara construction ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",

    "the most natural solution of these constraints is to ( arbitrarily ) choose @xmath95 , in agreement with our original expectation .",
    "however , as we will shortly see , this choice must be consistent with another consideration , and the natural choice in that case leads to a contradiction with the choice made above .",
    "we will therefore proceed in full generality so as to completely understand this intriguing situation .",
    "a chiral algebra comes equipped with an involutive antilinear antiautomorphism defining the adjoint on representations . in other words , chiral",
    "algebras are not just ( graded ) associative algebras , but ( graded ) _",
    "@xmath96-algebras_. we therefore need to be able to extend the adjoint of @xmath6 to the modes @xmath97 in a manner consistent with the algebraic structure of the extended theory .",

    "consideration of the conformal dimension and @xmath11-weight force @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a constant ( which we take to be independent of @xmath100 ) .",
    "the involutive nature of the adjoint then requires that @xmath101 the natural choice in this case is therefore to take @xmath102 for all @xmath103 . however , this leads to the promised contradiction with @xmath95 , which is detailed in the following computation : @xmath104}^{\\dag } & = \\bigl [ m { \\left ( k+1-m \\right ) } \\bigr]^{1/2 } \\bigl ( \\phi^{{\\left ( m-1 \\right)}}_{r+s } \\bigr)^{\\dag } = \\bigl [ m { \\left ( k+1-m \\right ) } \\bigr]^{1/2 } \\phi^{{\\left ( k+1-m \\right)}}_{-r - s } \\notag \\\\ & = { \\bigl [ f_{-r } , \\phi^{{\\left ( k - m \\right)}}_{-s } \\bigr ] } = -{\\bigl [ \\bigl ( \\phi^{{\\left ( m \\right)}}_s \\bigr)^{\\dag } , e_r^{\\dag } \\bigr]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this demonstrates that @xmath102 does _ not _ define an antiautomorphism of the extended theory when @xmath95 .    by repeating this computation ( and others ) for general @xmath99 and @xmath105 , @xmath106",
    ", we find that the extended adjoint thus defined avoids this contradiction precisely when @xmath107 of course , this does not itself imply that we have constructed an antiautomorphism of the extended algebra ( we will not even finish the derivation of this algebra until section  [ secalggcrs ] ) , merely that the above constraints are necessary to obtain an antiautomorphism .",
    "we note that these constraints imply that @xmath108 and @xmath109 are independent of @xmath103 : @xmath110 by equation  ( [ eqnjacidreq ] ) .",

    ".    however , recall that the purpose of the @xmath28 is to absorb some unpleasant factors in the operator product expansions , which derive from our insistence on simultaneously normalising the zero - grade states of a given module .",

    "that there are only two ( non - singular ) affine highest weight states is to be expected as the simple current has order two in the fusion ring .",

    "this proves that our spanning set is indeed a basis ( for the vacuum module ) , because it gives the correct character .    to compute the other character ( @xmath675 ) , there is one further constraint , because @xmath676 in general ( but equality always holds when @xmath669 ) .",
