    "dislocation behavior in solids under dynamic conditions ( e.g.  shock loading @xcite ) has recently attracted renewed attention , @xcite partly due to new insights provided by molecular dynamics studies .",
    "@xcite whereas theoretical investigations mainly focused on the stationary velocities that regular or twinning dislocations can attain as a function of the applied stress ( possibly intersonic or even supersonic with respect to the longitudinal wave speed @xmath0),@xcite one other major concern is to establish an equation of motion @xcite ( eom ) suitable to instationary dislocation motions towards or from such high velocities , and which is computationally cheap",
    ". this would be an important step towards extending dislocation dynamics ( dd ) simulations @xcite to the domain of high strain rates , in order to better understand hardening processes in such conditions .",
    "the key to instationary motion of dislocations lies in the inertia arising from changes in their long - ranged displacement field , which accompany the motion .",
    "these retarded rearrangements take place at finite speed , through wave emission and propagation from the dislocation . as a consequence , dislocations possess an effective inertial mass,@xcite which has bearings on the process of overcoming dynamically obstacles such as dipoles , etc .",
    "@xcite inertial effects are non - local in time , and are related to effective `` viscous '' losses . for small velocities where the eom is linear,@xcite",
    "this relation takes the form of the kramers - krnig relations between the reactive and dissipative parts of the causal mass kernel.@xcite one major ingredient of the eom should thus be the effective visco - inertial force exerted on the dislocation by its own wave emission.@xcite an eom results from balancing it by the applied stress , and by drags of various origins.@xcite eoms with effective masses , but which ignore retardation ( e.g. , ref . ) , can not truly capture visco - inertial effects .",
    "previous works on these questions having mainly been confined to the linear regime , their influence in the relativistic domain remains largely unexplored in spite of analytical progresses , partly due to the complexity of the formalism ( especially for edge dislocations ) .",
    "hereafter , eshelby s eom for screws with a rigid core,@xcite valid at small velocities , is first re - examined , and cast under a simple form which suggests a straightforward regularization procedure for finite core effects .",
    "this allows us to appeal to previous results for point dislocations valid at high velocities.@xcite we then build in an heuristic way an eom for accelerated or decelerated screw and edge dislocations in the drag - dominated subsonic regime , that consistently accounts for saturation effects at velocities comparable to the sound speed . results from the equation are compared to quasi - exact calculations from a numerical method of the phase - field type .",
    "having in mind applications to dd simulations , the scope of the study is limited to continuum theory , so that dispersion effects due to the atomic lattice,@xcite or to the influence of the peierls potential,@xcite are not explicitly considered .",
    "within the peierls - nabarro model in isotropic elasticity,@xcite and with the usual @xmath1 ansatz for the relative displacement @xmath2 of the atoms on both sides of the glide plane , eshelby computed the visco - inertial force @xmath3 experienced by a screw dislocation of burgers vector @xmath4 , centered on position @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , moving with a velocity @xmath7 small compared to the shear wave speed @xmath8:@xcite @xmath9^{1/2}}\\\\ & & { } + m_0\\int_{-\\infty}^t \\hspace{-1em}{\\rm d}\\!\\tau \\frac{t_{\\rm s}^2}{\\left[(t-\\tau)^2+t_{\\rm s}^2\\right]^{3/2 } } \\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}\\tau}\\left(\\frac{x(t)-x(\\tau)}{t-\\tau}\\right)\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dislocation is assumed to have a _ rigid _ core of half - width @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath11 is the time of shear wave propagation over the core width .",
    "the mass per unit dislocation length @xmath12 depends on the shear modulus @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "( and in ref .   as well )",
    ", an incorrect factor @xmath14 is present in front of the second integral , and has been removed here .",
    "this factor is of no important physical consequence , save for different values of the linear response kernels ; see below .",
    "that ( [ eq : eshforce ] ) is correct can be verified as follows .",
    "starting from eshelby s expression of the force as a double integral in eq .",

    "moreover , we observe that @xmath33 result ( [ eq : massker ] ) coincides to leading order with eshelby s , @xcite as @xmath34 . the mass increase with wavelength as @xmath35 implies very different behaviors for , e.g. , quasi - static and shock loading modes , since the latter involves a wider frequency range .",
    "we note that @xmath36 as @xmath34 , since losses should be absent from the model in the stationary subsonic regime .",
    "@xcite the non - analytical behavior of the kernels at @xmath37 ( due to @xmath38 ) , and its associated non - locality in time has been emphasized in ref .  .",
    "the finite `` instantaneous '' viscosity ( [ eq : viscoinfty ] ) stems from the first term in the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : canonical ] ) , and is responsible for a velocity jump @xmath39 undergone by the dislocation when subjected to a jump @xmath40 in the applied force.@xcite from ( [ eq : viscoinfty ] ) we deduce : @xmath41 the velocity jump ( [ eq : vjump ] ) increases with core width .",
    "it was first predicted by eshelby from his equation,@xcite and can be understood as follows for a screw dislocation along the @xmath42 axis : the force jump @xmath40 is due to a shear stress jump @xmath43 attaining simultaneously all the points of the whole glide plane ( e.g. , as the result of shear loading applied on faces of the system containing the plane , parallel to the latter ) . neglecting material inertia of the atoms on both sides of the dislocation plane , the medium undergoes an elastic strain jump @xmath44 , determined by a material velocity jump @xmath45 .",
    "the latter is equilibrated through outward emission of a shear wave with velocity @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope of the displacement function near the core is @xmath46 , so that @xmath45 is related to the dislocation velocity jump @xmath39 by @xmath47 . combining these relationships yields ( [ eq : vjump ] ) , up to a numerical constant factor .",
    "the same argument applies to other types of dislocations . in case of several relaxation waves ( e.g. , longitudinal and shear waves for an edge dislocation ) , that of lowest celerity controls the amplitude of the velocity jump .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that accounting for material inertia from the atoms on both sides of the glide plane results in an instantaneous inertial force of order @xmath48 to be added to ( [ eq : eshforce]).@xcite by balancing the forces , it is seen that this force should spread the velocity jump over a short rise time @xmath49",
    "no expression analogous to ( [ eq : eshforce ] ) is available for edge dislocations .",
    "however , clifton and markenscoff computed the force acting on a _ point _ screw or edge dislocation moving with any subsonic velocity in an isotropic medium , that jumps instantaneously at instant @xmath50 from rest to a constant velocity @xmath51.@xcite a generalization to anisotropic media is available.@xcite to maintain its velocity constant , this dislocation must be subjected , at time @xmath52 , to the time - decaying force @xmath53 where the function @xmath54 depends on its character and on anisotropy .",
    "@xcite we now construct heuristically a force for accelerated motion by interpreting such a motion as a succession of infinitesimal velocity jumps . assuming that , for instationary motion , @xmath51 in ( [ eq : fcm ] ) can be interpreted as @xmath15 , the elementary force that would arise from the elementary jump @xmath55 at @xmath50 is : @xmath56\\delta v(\\tau)$ ] @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "then , the total force experienced by the dislocation results from integrating such elementary forces over past history : @xmath59 comparing ( [ eq : newforce0 ] ) to ( [ eq : flin2 ] ) shows , firstly , that the relevant `` accelerations '' at linear order are different .",
    "however , we remark that @xmath60/(t-\\tau)\\}\\to \\dot{v}(\\tau)$ ] as @xmath61 , and moreover that for a screw dislocation , @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite hence , since we interpret @xmath51 in ( [ eq : fcm ] ) as @xmath15 , the numerator of the integrand in ( [ eq : newforce0 ] ) is correct at least for small velocities and for small times @xmath61 .",
    "its relevance for large velocities is demonstrated below through comparisons to full - field calculations .",
    "next , integral ( [ eq : newforce0 ] ) is singular at @xmath63 , due the point - dislocation hypothesis at the root of ( [ eq : fcm ] ) .",
    "however , using ( [ eq : flin2 ] ) as a physical motivation , we propose a regularization consisting in replacing the kernel @xmath64 in ( [ eq : newforce0 ] ) by @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath66 , the counterpart of @xmath67 in ( [ eq : eshforce ] ) , is some time characteristic of sound propagation over a core diameter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : appli ] , @xmath66 is chosen alternatively proportional to @xmath11 and to @xmath68 in the case of edge dislocations for illustrative purposes , whereas @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath67 for screws",
    ". the proportionality factor , 1/2 in all cases , is justified below . from a physical point of view",
    ", inertia is controlled by the slowest wave so that better results are expected using @xmath8 for all types of dislocations .",
    "given eshelby s rigid - core hypothesis in ( [ eq : flin2 ] ) , and the approximations made , it would be pointless to refine this treatment .",
    "another kind of regularization is used in ref .",

    "the force eventually reads : @xmath71^{1/2}}\\dot{v}(\\tau).\\ ] ] its fourier transform for small velocities where @xmath72 yields , in terms of modified bessel and struve functions of order 0 ,    [ eq : masskercfapprox ] @xmath73\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\pi}{2}|\\omega|+o(t_{\\rm s}|\\omega|^2)\\\\   \\label{veshcfapproxinf}\\eta(|\\omega|\\to\\infty)/g'(0)&=&1/t_0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the approximation therefore preserves the logarithmic character of the mass , and the viscosity , to leading order . the mass is slightly decreased , the constant @xmath74 in ( [ mesh ] ) being absent .",
    "this difference is insignificant given the approximations made . in the limit of small velocity for a screw dislocation , our approximation amounts to retaining in ( [ eq : eshforce ] ) the first integral only . in order to recover a correct velocity jump for screws",
    ", we must take @xmath75 since the instantaneous viscosity ( [ veshcfapproxinf ] ) is different from ( [ eq : viscoinfty ] ) .",
    "this `` calibration '' is used in the next section for screws and ( somewhat arbitrarily ) for edges as well .    in the stationary limit , the visco - inertial force ( [ eq : newforce1 ] ) vanishes . for @xmath76 ,",

    "comparisons between eoms and png calculations are then harder to make than in the accelerated case . indeed , the non - relativistic ( resp .",
    "relativistic ) theoretical curves from eq.([eq : pdpeq ] ) ( dashed - dot ) [ resp .  ( dashed ) ] are obtained by assuming that an applied stress abruptly vanishes at @xmath113 .",
    "this induces a negative velocity jump in the curves .",
    "this jump is larger if non - relativistic expressions are used , which demonstrates in passing the higher inertia ( i.e.  `` mass '' ) provided by relativistic expressions .",
    "the same loading was tried in the png calculations as well , but led to non - exploitable results due to multiple wave - propagation and reflection phenomena .",
    "therefore , png curves for decelerated motion were obtained instead using a somewhat artificial loading : the medium was split in a zone of constant stress , separated from a zone of zero stress by an immobile and sharp boundary . the dislocation is then made to accelerate in the zone of constant stress . due to the finite core width , the boundary is crossed in a finite time @xmath127 , which explains the smoothed decay of the velocity in the png data points .",
    "this type of loading can not be realistically implemented within the framework of eq.([eq : pdpeq ] ) because the dislocation core is not spatially resolved . hence , though the curves strongly suggest that relativistic effects are as important in deceleration as in acceleration , and that ( [ eq : pdpeq ] ) reproduces well the png points , the comparison between the latter and theoretical curves should be taken here with a grain of salt . on the other hand , the eom of ref .",
    "( solid ) is once again clearly imprecise . as a final remark",

    "the best matches with full - field results were found with our eom , both for accelerated and for decelerated motion , thus illustrating quantitatively the importance of retardation and of relativistic effects in the dynamic motion of dislocations . to these effects",
