    "we can mention only a few with the understanding that the list is by no means exhaustive .",
    "dynamical wormholes were discovered and studied in refs . @xcite and wormholes in cosmological settings",
    "were contemplated in various works ( @xcite and references therein ) , with particular attention being paid to wormholes with cosmological constant @xmath0 , which are asymptotically de sitter or anti de sitter according to the sign of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these geometrical constructions are designed to allow travelers to pass from one region of spacetime to another or even from one universe to another .",
    "it is also to be noted that wormholes are as valid solutions of einstein s theory of gravity as are the black holes in the sense that no experiment has so far ruled out the existence of macroscopic wormhole structures in classical gravity . in the high energy experiments , such as lhc , microscopic wormholes are a distinct possibility . on the other hand , it would be of interest to know if there could exist wormholes connecting two spacetimes of spherical symmetric galaxies .",
    "we are interested here in traversable wormholes but the situation is that , a humanly traversable wormhole solution covered by single regular coordinate chart is generally unavailable except in a few cases such as the ellis wormhole @xcite and in a particular class of solution in the brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to use the cut and paste technology developed by visser @xcite , where one joins two copies of spacetimes across a throat threaded by a thin - shell of matter , to construct a traversable wormhole .",
    "some recent articles related to thin - shell wormholes can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . note that in @xcite a solution describing a wormhole shell joining two identical lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) universes is analyzed ( see @xcite and references therein for some remarks on these universes ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , we construct an intra - galactic thin shell wormhole joining two copies of identical galactic space times described by the mannheim - kazanas de sitter solution in conformal gravity and study its stability under spherical perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the thin shell material as a chaplygin gas and discuss in detail the values of the relevant parameters under which the wormhole is stable . </S>",
    "<S> we study the stability following the method by eiroa and we also qualitatively analyze the dynamics through the method of weierstrass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wormhole is generally unstable but there is a small interval in radius for which the wormhole is stable . </S>"
