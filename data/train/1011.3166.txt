    "the study of axially symmetric solutions of the einstein and einstein - maxwell field equations corresponding to disklike configurations of matter , apart from its purely mathematical interest , has a clear astrophysical relevance .",
    "indeed , thin disks can be used to model accretion disks , galaxies in thermodynamical equilibrium and the superposition of a black hole and a galaxy .",
    "disk sources for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with magnetic fields are also of astrophysical importance mainly in the study of neutron stars , white dwarfs and galaxy formation .",
    "exact solutions that have relativistic static thin disks as their sources were first studied by bonnor and sackfield @xcite and morgan and morgan @xcite .",
    "subsequently , several classes of exact solutions corresponding to static @xcite and stationary @xcite thin disks have been obtained by different authors , and the superposition of a static or stationary thin disk with a black hole has been considered@xcite .",
    "relativistic disks embedded in an expanding frw universe have been studied in @xcite , perfect fluid disks with halos in @xcite , and the stability of thin disks models has been investigated using a first order perturbation of the energy - momentum tensor in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "thin disks have been discussed as sources for kerr - newman fields @xcite , magnetostatic axisymmetric fields @xcite , and conformastatic and conformastationary metrics @xcite . also , models of electrovacuum static counterrotating dust disks were presented in @xcite , charged perfect fluid disks were studied in @xcite , and charged perfect fluid disks as sources of static and taub - nut - type spacetimes in @xcite .",
    "now , the thin disks with magnetic fields presented at references @xcite were obtained by means of the well known ` displace , cut and reflect ' method in order to introduce a discontinuity at the first derivative of one otherwise smooth solution .",
    "the result is a solution with a singularity of the delta function type in all the @xmath0 hypersurface and so can be interpreted as an infinite thi disk . on the other hand ,",
    "solutions that can be interpreted as thin disks of finite extension can be obtained if a proper coordinate system is introduced . a coordinate system that adapts naturally to a finite source and presents the required discontinuous behavior is given by the oblate spheroidal coordinates .",
    "some examples of finite thin disks from vacuum solutions expressed in these coordinates can be found in references @xcite , and from electrovacuum solutions in reference @xcite .    according to the above considerations , the purpose of our paper is to present a new infinite family of exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations for axially symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the solutions are obtained by the use of the horsk - mitskievitch conjecture @xcite , which prescribes a quite close connection between isometries of vacuum spacetimes ( seed metrics ) and the electromagnetic four - potential of a generated einstein - maxwell fields .",
    "we take the morgan and morgan metric disk @xcite as the seed solution .",
    "the generated solutions describe a family of magnetized finite thin disks , which is the magnetized version of the family of relativistic static morgan and morgan disks .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : einm ] , the weyl - lewis - papapetrou line element is considered and einstein - maxwell equations in cylindrical coordinates are introduced . the procedure to obtain magnetovacuum static , axially symmetric relativistic thin disks without radial pressure is also summarized in this section .",
    "section [ sec : hm ] introduces the horsk - mitskievitch generating conjecture used to obtain a general kind of weyl - lewis - papapetrou spacetime with magnetic field . in section [ sec : mmm ] , we put forward a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations describing an infinite family of finite static magnetized thin disks by the use of the horsk - mitskievitch ( hm ) conjecture .",
    "for this purpose , the well known morgan and morgan metric disk @xcite is employed as seed solution @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis of the physical behavior of solutions is presented in section [ sec : beh ] where the asymptotic behavior of the solutions is examined .",

    "therefore , they are continuous functions everywhere but their first @xmath15-derivatives discontinuous at the disk surface . consequently , in order to obtain the energy - momentum tensor and the current density of the source , the jump across the disk of the first @xmath15-derivatives of the metric tensor is expressed as @xmath16 = 2 { g_{ab , z}}|_{_{z = 0^+}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the jump across the disk of the electromagnetic field tensor is expressed as @xmath17 = [ a_{a , z } ] = 2 { a_{a , z}}|_{_{z = 0^+}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the reflection symmetry of the functions with respect to @xmath0 has been used .    then , using the distributional approach @xcite or the junction conditions on the extrinsic curvature of thin shells @xcite , the einstein - maxwell equations yield an energy - momentum tensor as @xmath18 + q^{ab } \\delta(z ) , \\label{eq : emtot}\\ ] ] and the current density as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the heaviside and dirac distributions with support on @xmath0 . here",

    "we also consider the mass density on the surface of the disk , defined as @xmath43 in the same way , the current density on the disk can be written as @xmath44 as we can see the charge density on the disk surface is identically equal to zero .",

    "the disks with higher values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 show an energy distribution that is more concentrated in the center and lower at the edge . it can be observed that the energy density in the central region of the disk decreases with the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the figure [ fig : pressure ] shows the dimensionless azimuthal pressure , @xmath142 for the models corresponding to @xmath131 and @xmath132 . as we see , in all the cases , the pressure is everywhere positive and rapidly increases as we move away from the center of the disk .",
    "it reaches a maximum and , later , it rapidly decreases .",
    "it can be observed that the presence of a magnetic field increases the pressure everywhere on the disk . otherwise , the maximum increases and moves away from the disk edge as @xmath140 increases .",
    "it can be also observed that the surface current density , represented in figure [ fig : current ] , has a behavior similar to that of the pressure .    in order to illustrate graphically the behavior of the circular velocities or rotation curves , we introduce the dimensionless quantity @xmath143 in figure [ fig : velocity ] we plot the dimensionless rotation curves for the models corresponding to @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the circular velocity corresponding to @xmath144 is a monotonously increasing function of the radius . on the other hand , for @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the circular velocity increases from a value of zero at the center of the disks until it attains a maximum at a critical radius and then , it decreases to acquire a finite value at the edge of the disk .",
    "it can also be seen that the value of the critical radius increases as the values of @xmath140 decreases and @xmath141 increases .",

    "obviously , this property in the curvature is , of course , inherited from the seed morgan and morgan metric disk ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : met3 ] ) in terms of the seed solution ( morgan and morgan metric disk , @xmath151 ) can be written in the form @xmath152 - \\phi_s \\label{eq : hp}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , when we take @xmath153 clearly we see that , unlike the morgan and morgan seed solution , generated spacetimes are not asymptotically flat . consequently , although the technique described here produces a new class of solution of einstein - maxwell s equations and all the physical quantities exhibit an excellent behavior , the method offers very little insight into the physical implications of the metrics .",
    "the reason of this non - flatness far away from the disk should be that the magnetic field itself does not decay at infinity as it appears to be easily expressible from ( [ eq : hp2 ] ) .",
