    "geometrically frustrated quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( af ) in low dimensions have long emerged as a popular field of study in condensed matter in understanding the magnetic properties of various magnetic materials with layered structures . as for example , the key to charge transport in the newly discovered iron - based high temperature superconductors@xcite is believed to exist in their spin - frustrated conducting feas layers . or , the spin-@xmath0 @xmath6 ions in recently synthesized vanadium oxide compounds like @xmath7 are found to possess pairs of frustrating super - exchange paths among them in their two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic layers@xcite .",
    "a 2d @xmath1 model , with competing @xmath8 and @xmath9 af interactions , gives different phases in different parameter range of @xmath10 .",
    "a classically neel - ordered phase with @xmath11 magnetic long range order is formed for small @xmath3 whereas a columnar @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 ordered phase is obtained for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "numerous works have been done on this model using different methods like exact diagonalization@xcite , spin wave calculations@xcite , series expansion@xcite etc .",
    "that resulted in these conclusions .",
    "quantum fluctuations , on the other hand , result in a disordered spin liquid phase in such system for intermediate values of frustration : @xmath14@xcite .",
    "chandra et al.@xcite used conventional spin wave theory to study this model and predicted a spin - liquid ground state for large values of frustration . later , dagotto et al.@xcite used exact diagonalization to show how magnetization changes with @xmath3 .",
    "their calculations indicated neel ordered af phase and columnar phase at small and large values of @xmath3 respectively .",
    "recently , li et al.@xcite used a bosonic resonating valence - bond ansatz to find out that stable spin liquid phases are indeed there in such systems for moderate values of frustration : @xmath14 .",
    "the present work involves studying the spin ordered phases of a spin-@xmath0 2d @xmath1 model using a four - sublattice description .",
    "we use the linear spin wave ( lsw ) approximation to identify the magnon modes about the @xmath15 and @xmath16 reference states for @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively and consider spin wave expansion about these states .",
    "our calculations are based on the four sublattice nature of the problem which comes naturally from the competing @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "our results derived are found compatible with the earlier two - sublattice calculations@xcite on the model , because the magnetic reference states , in the two limits that we consider , retains their two - sublattice nature .",
    "we emphasize at this point that the competing interaction pair ensures the four sublattice nature to the problem and , as a consequence , the appearance of multiple magnon branches in the system whose signatures are witnessed experimentally , @xmath19 , in neutron diffraction results@xcite in various frustrated magnetic systems .",
    "our work also include a study of the @xmath4 model in an undoped frustrated antiferromagnet to witness the hole motion in it .",
    "self consistent born approximation ( scba ) is used to sum up the self energy diagrams within the non - crossing approximation and the single hole spectra are obtained for the system with the underlying four - sublattice structure .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to form a building block in understanding the magnon dispersions and the magnon - mediated hole - hole interactions in a 2d frustrated antiferromagnet that can be realized and later on compared with neutron diffraction or angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) results obtained from various frustrated quasi-2d spin systems like @xmath7@xcite or the feas superconducting compounds@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 is the formulation part which describes a 2d @xmath1 spin hamiltonian and the conventional linear spin wave analysis on it . in section 3 , we discuss the bogoliubov transformation yielding the magnon modes for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "section 4 deals with the hole hopping using a @xmath4 model .",
    "scba is used to obtain the hole spectral functions and the spectral behavior are discussed in detail . finally in section 5 , we summarize our results and discuss the importance of the work presented .",
    "in a 2d square lattice that we consider , a @xmath1 heisenberg spin hamiltonian is given as @xmath20 where @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 represent indices for the nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) site - pairs respectively and @xmath25 denotes the spin .",
    "@xmath22 produces two opposite spin sublattices and at low temperature , the elementary excitations of spin waves or magnons are created on top of this @xmath15 af reference state .",
    "@xmath24 , however , involves nnn af spin interactions that do not communicate between @xmath26 and @xmath27 sublattices caused by @xmath28 . rather within each such sublattice , it creates two sublattices on its own .",
    "thus an overall outer product of four spin sublattices are formed in a @xmath1 antiferromagnet , as also demonstrated in ref.@xcite ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this @xmath1 model represents a frustrated spin system as the @xmath8 and @xmath9 terms prefer different spin - orders to be the ground state of the system . for comparatively small strength of @xmath9 with the factor @xmath10 being a small fraction",
    ", the @xmath15 spin order describes the reference state of the system and the spin excitations appear above this vacuum state . at large enough value of @xmath3 however , a @xmath16 or @xmath13 ordered state",
    "becomes the zero spin deviation vacuum state of the system .",
    "here in this work , we use lsw approximation@xcite to find the magnon modes of the @xmath1 model about @xmath15 and @xmath16 spin ordered states at small and large values of @xmath3 respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the real space snapshot of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 reference states with the indication of the 4 sublattices .",
    "the unit vectors in real space for the @xmath1 model are @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( and @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the fourier space ) .",
    "the 1st brillouin zone ( bz ) is a square with corners at @xmath33 .",
    "the lattice is broken down to 4 sublattices and the lsw calculation gives two different spin wave modes each with degeneracy 2 ( for the spin up - down symmetry ) .",
    "the bosonic spin wave operators @xmath34 s are defined as @xmath35 for the pair of @xmath36 sublattices ( non - identical , because they experience non - zero interaction with each other ) and they follow the fourier transformation : @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the bloch wave vectors within the bz .",
    "this transforms our eq.[eq1 ] to @xmath39 with @xmath40 being a constant term and the column vector @xmath41 . for small @xmath3 with @xmath15 reference state",
    ", we find @xmath42 + with @xmath43cos@xmath44cos@xmath45 . on the other hand , for large @xmath3 with @xmath16 reference state , we obtain @xmath46    here , it should be noted that in the @xmath1 hamiltonian , the mere presence of the @xmath9 term imposes four sublattices to the system irrespective of the strength of frustration @xmath3 .",
    "but because at small and large values of @xmath3 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 term dominates the magnetics respectively , two - sublattice magnetic stable reference states can be found . and thus results from the four - sublattice calculations in those limits can also be obtained from mere two - sublattice considerations of the problem followed by folding of the bands as per the requirement of unit cell doubling in the @xmath1 hamiltonian .",
    "but that can not refrain one from carrying out the calculations using the actual four - sublattice structure , as is done in this present paper , which is the general feature of the problem as far as the hamiltonian is concerned .",
    "this hamiltonian is diagonalized using bogoliubov transformation which is a canonical transformation where new bosonic operators @xmath47 s are introduced as @xmath48 where sum over jo ( 1 , 3 ) and je ( 2 , 4 ) are implied , @xmath49 being the @xmath5 coefficient matrix .",
    "the bosonization condition for the variables @xmath50 requires @xmath51 while the diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix requires @xmath52 @xmath53 denoting the @xmath54-th eigen - energy mode .",
    "non - trivial solution of eq.[eq4 ] gives the eigenvalues .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the magnon modes for @xmath55 for both small and large @xmath3 s .    for @xmath56 with ( @xmath57 ) reference state",
    ", we obtain the acoustic and optical spin wave modes ( as also mentioned in ref.@xcite ) given by @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ".    for @xmath60 , similar calculation with @xmath16 order representing the zero - spin deviation state gives multiple acoustic modes with expressions @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "let s take a look at the brillouin zones shown in fig.[figbz ] . here",
    ", the bz for our 4-sublattice magnetic picture ( let s call it bz0 ) , a square with corners at @xmath33 , is shown ( black lines ) along with the unit cells bz1 and bz2 , corresponding to @xmath15 ( red , dash - dotted ) and @xmath16 ( blue , dashed ) reference states respectively .",
    "for @xmath63 , we have the bz for the neel af , as shown by the square with dash - dotted lines in fig.[figbz ] .",
    "the acoustic mode at @xmath64 point @xmath65 has zero dispersion energy as described by the goldstone theorem . for @xmath3 small",
    ", we have a stable @xmath15 reference state though the presence of @xmath9 term brings in 4 sublattices to the system and thus a further reduced bz0 .",
    "due to band - folding , the @xmath16 point of bz1 falls on the @xmath64 point of bz0 . and the dispersion energy for the acoustic mode at @xmath66 being non - zero",
    ", we get an band - folded optical mode with a non - zero spin gap at the zone center of the bz .    in the other limit of @xmath67 , we have a classical ground state degeneracy between @xmath16 and @xmath13 states . for the @xmath16 spin reference state that we consider here",
    ", the @xmath13 vector of bz2 folds back to the @xmath64 point due to band folding .",
    "but as the dispersion energy for the acoustic mode at @xmath68 is zero , we no more get an optical mode .",
    "rather two distinct acoustic modes are obtained in the reduced picture .",
    "these modes become degenerate in the limit @xmath69 where its expression becomes same as that of a @xmath9 antiferromagnet .",
    "it should be pointed out here that though the four sublattice picture gives the degeneracy between @xmath70 and @xmath13 states , they correspond to different points in the brillouin zone and thus represent different spin wave modes .",
    "our magnon dispersion expressions , when unfolded to the two - sublattice picture , matches with the dispersion relations reported in various literature@xcite .    in this context , we should mention that for large frustration ( as compared to small @xmath3 ) , the @xmath71 lattice symmetry is broken@xcite and there is a degeneracy between @xmath72 and @xmath73 reference states . within a two - sublattice picture with , say , @xmath74 denoting the reference state , zero dispersions",
    "are found not only at the @xmath64 point but also for the @xmath75 vector .",
    "a 4-sublattice description becomes more appropriate in this limit where zero magnon energies appear only at the @xmath64 point .",
    "also the reduced bz gives multiple magnon modes which in turn helps us understanding the multiple spin gaps observed experimentally in highly frustrated magnetic systems@xcite .",
    "these systems , for example the iron pnictide compound @xmath76 ( with typically @xmath77 ) , where uniaxial anisotropy is also present , witness multiple spin gaps in the neutron diffraction experiment ( see fig.3a and fig.2a in ref.@xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "a four - sublattice description of the @xmath1 af recognizes the unit - cell doubling corresponding to the hamiltonian and gives the multiple magnon branches to the system .",
    "these modes , in turn , get shifted differently in the presence of an anisotropy term leading to multiple spin gaps , as seen experimentally .",
    "for example , our calculations can give rise to distinct spin gaps of @xmath78 ( for large @xmath3 ) if an easy axis anisotropy term @xmath79 is added to the hamiltonian .",
    "instead , a ferromagnetic term can also be added to break this @xmath80 mode degeneracy .",
    "reference to the inelastic neutron scattering results from the iron pnictides can be made in this connection .",
    "they show maximum magnon energy at the ferromagnetic zone boundary , unlike a zero energy mode at the @xmath13 vector ( as seen in this paper ) of a @xmath1 antiferromagnet . a net ferro spin coupling in the ferro direction ( @xmath81 in this case ) is thus required , in this case , to obtain the magnon dispersion in agreement with the experiments@xcite .",
    "in order to incorporate hole motion in such a system we include nn hole - hopping . the resulting @xmath4 hamiltonian is thus given by @xmath82 @xmath83 denoting the fermionic annihilation operators , maintaining the constraint of no double occupancy .",
    "the @xmath84 term can be linearized after rewriting it in terms of spin wave operators and the slave fermions as worked out in ref.@xcite for a 2d @xmath85 model .",
    "the only difference in our case will be due to having 4 sublattices and a green s function matrix that has non - zero off - diagonal entries .",
    "let us consider @xmath15 reference state for small @xmath3 . in this case",
    "we have coupled dyson s equations for a @xmath5 green s function matrix : @xmath86 where the superscripts indicate the iteration numbers . by symmetry ,",
    "all @xmath87 s are same and off - diagonal @xmath88 s are non - zero only if @xmath89 pairs are ( 1,3 ) or ( 2,4 ) .",
    "solving matrix equation gives @xmath90 here argument of @xmath91 are implied for all the variables .    within the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) ,",
    "hole self energy expressions are obtained as @xmath92,\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_{13}(k,\\omega)=&c_0[(g_{12j}^2(k , q)+f_{14j}^2(k , q))g_{13}(k - q,\\omega-\\omega_{j , q})\\nonumber\\\\&+2g_{12j}(k , q)f_{14j}(k , q)g_{11}(k - q,\\omega-\\omega_{j , q } ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where sum over @xmath93 , @xmath94 ( 1 and 3 ) and @xmath95 ( 2 and 4 ) are implied .",
    "@xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 denotes the @xmath94-th magnon mode energy at wave vector @xmath100 .",
    "c +    with this self - energy expression we solve the dyson s equation ( eq.[eq6 ] ) iteratively following scba to obtain the single hole spectra which is given as @xmath101/\\pi$ ] . here",
    "@xmath102 denotes the eigenvalues of the green s function matrix of which @xmath103 corresponds to the @xmath104 value in the 1st bz whereas @xmath105 corresponds to the other mode appearing due to folding of the bands in the reduced bz of the four - sublattice structure .",
    "our findings show that the general feature of the hole spectra is to have a low energy quasi - particle like excitation followed by a series of higher energy excitations called string states@xcite .",
    "the lowest quasi - particle ( qp ) peak is found at @xmath106 and as we increase @xmath3 from 0 to 0.4 , the @xmath106 peak gradually shifts to lower energy and reduces its strength .",
    ".1 in    .1 in .05 in    our spectral results in the @xmath107 limit are essentially the same as obtained from scba calculations done on a @xmath85 model@xcite",
    ". the comparison at non - zero values of @xmath9 has also been made . in fig.[fig3 ] top - panel , we show the @xmath108 spectra of a @xmath5 lattice at @xmath109 ( with @xmath110 ) obtained by our scba calculation with exact diagonalization ( ed ) plot taken from ref.@xcite demonstrating good match between the two .",
    "however we find that our results are not identical to the scba results of ref.@xcite also shown in fig.[fig3 ] , though our results match much better with the exact result both in position and relative - strengths of the spectral peaks - corresponding to both the lowest energy qp and the high energy string excitations . as a further check",
    ", we also plot our results as well as scba results shown in ref.@xcite together in fig.[fig3 ] bottom - panel .",
    "the comparison clearly shows that our plot falls essentially on top of that from ref.@xcite , but shows discernible difference with the plot from ref.@xcite ( see note @xcite in the references ) .    in fig.[fig4 ] , we have shown the hole spectra for @xmath3= 0.005 , 0.1 and 0.3 respectively ( @xmath111 ) obtained from a @xmath112 lattice for @xmath113 and @xmath65 .",
    "the energy resolution of our numerical calculation is @xmath114 and the small parameter @xmath115 . with these specifications ,",
    "@xmath112 lattice represent a large enough system to avoid the finite size effects in the spectral plots@xcite .",
    "a hole in a 2d @xmath85 model prefers to move with wave vector @xmath116 .",
    "we observe that with nnn af interaction present , this remains the case for @xmath117 . in the @xmath4 model , with @xmath9 switched on starting from zero , low energy spectral peaks move to lower energies and this shift becomes more for higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "peaks along @xmath116 to @xmath118 directions which were already close to the lowest peak at @xmath116 for @xmath119 , becomes even closer as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath116 peak stays the lowest energy peak as long as @xmath117 .",
    "we also notice loss of intensity in the qp as well as the string states as @xmath9 is increased gradually .",
    "this enables a smooth transfer of spectral intensity from lowest peak at @xmath108 to the highest peak at @xmath70 resembling a water - fall as shown in fig.[fign ] .",
    "this effect of frustration ( as long as the @xmath15 reference state remains stable ) is , thus , the same as that of electron - phonon coupling@xcite or doping@xcite in smearing out the long lived well - defined qp excitations and thereby producing smooth transitions in spectral intensity from the low energy peak to the high energy peak .",
    "this so called waterfall-feature in intensity is observed along the nodal direction in the arpes results of the superconducting cuprates@xcite .",
    "the comparison can even be improved if the finiteness of the onsite coulomb repulsion between hole / electrons is considered as well ( @xmath19 , see ref.@xcite for calculations using a hubbard model with extended hoppings ) .",
    ".06 in    fig.[splot ] shows the qp hole energies ( @xmath120 ) in the 1st brillouin zone for @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the lowest energy excitations are created around @xmath123 ) points .",
    "these are the most likely hole excitations to form during photo - emission from the undoped af samples producing hole - pockets around @xmath123 ) points . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest @xmath120 values are obtained at and around the @xmath64 point .",
    "though the features for hole bands do not show any visible change between @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the energy shifts are clearly seen between the two frustration levels .",
    "also in fig.[fig5 ] left panel , we have constructed the hole energy band along the boundary of the irreducible bz , namely @xmath124 for similar values of @xmath3 .",
    "it clearly shows how the qp peak positions lower in energy with an increase in @xmath9 . at the same time the hole bandwidth",
    "@xmath125 also decreases as @xmath126 .",
    "the construction of this hole - bands involves defining the lowest energy excitations for different @xmath104-values to be the qp excitations of the holes . but",
    "calculation of the residues ( @xmath127 ) of those lowest energy peaks shows gradual decrease@xcite in value ( see fig.[fig5 ] right panel ) as @xmath3 is increased from zero .",
    "we see that , for @xmath128 , the residue for the @xmath70 ( or @xmath15 ) vector almost vanishes .",
    "so we find that the qp description of the hole excitations , for such @xmath104 vector , does not remain valid even for such moderate value of frustration .    for large frustration , with a @xmath16 reference state , neighboring spins",
    "along @xmath129-directions prefer to align ferromagnetically while that along @xmath130 prefers an af order .",
    "the hopping term in the hamiltonian gives the on - site hole energies to be @xmath131cos(@xmath132 ) whereas a typical off - diagonal term there is of the form @xmath133 , @xmath134 being the hole annihilation operator of @xmath135-th type at wave - vector @xmath104 .",
    "the vector @xmath68 falls within the 1st brillouin zone of the two - sublatice picture ( the dashed - line rectangle in fig.[figbz ] ) and it has zero magnon energies ( @xmath136 for all @xmath137 ) . thus the degenerate magnon modes @xmath65 and @xmath13 contribute different hole energies due to the nn hole - hoppings .",
    "also , @xmath138 in the term @xmath133 implies that a hole , by consecutive annihilation - creation , can change its wave - vector by @xmath100 ( having non - zero magnitude ) , yet not changing its energy at all . in the four - sublattice picture , @xmath13 vector is no more within the 1st brillouin zone .",
    "but here the degeneracy among the magnon modes increases manifold .",
    "these cases are dealt with proper linear combination of eigen functions so that the coefficients of the bogoliubov transformation are obtained maintaining the bosonic commutation relations .",
    "as far as the hole spectral functions are concerned , the holes in a @xmath16 ( or a @xmath13 ) background , with a nn hopping term , always prefers to move along the ferromagnetic alignment of spins ( the @xmath129-direction for a @xmath16 reference state ) in the lattice , as moving in the orthogonal direction involves leaving behind strings of anti - aligned spins@xcite in the expense of high energy cost .",
    "that is why , string excitations are unlikely to form among the low energy holes .",
    "the hole spectral calculations for large frustration , owing to these special features , need thorough analysis and we would like to discuss this matter in detail later in a future communication .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the spin dynamics of a 2d @xmath1 model and found the acoustic and optical magnon modes about the state @xmath139 .",
    "contrarily , two acoustic and no optical modes are obtained when large values of @xmath3 are considered and @xmath66 is used as the reference state .",
    "hole spectra are obtained from a 2d @xmath4 model for small @xmath3 .",
    "we observe the qp and string - like excitations in the spectral behavior . the energy shift and bandwidth reduction for the hole",
    "qp is also witnessed as @xmath3 is increased from zero .",
    "our calculations , in general , can represent a nice exercise to show how the magnon modes can be studied for a superlattice structure starting from suitable reference states and how the hole spectra can be obtained for the same from the eigenvalues of the green s function matrix , obtained by solving the dyson s equation self - consistently .    as we said earlier , we plan to present this hole spectral analysis in the largely frustrating limit rigorously later in a future communication - which can also include special situations with the reference state being a superposition of the degenerate magnetic orders@xcite .",
    "our four - sublattice calculations can also stand as an important building block for performing the more involved hole spectral calculations in the multi - orbital @xmath4 models@xcite in the limit of large frustration ( typically @xmath140 ) , so that comparison with the arpes results obtained from feas superconduting materials@xcite becomes possible .",

    "<S> we study a two dimensional spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 antiferromagnet in a square lattice using the linearized spin wave theory recognizing the 4-sublattice nature of the underlying magnetic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> multiple magnon modes with optical and acoustic branches about the stable neel ordered and double acoustic branches about the columnar reference states are obtained for small and large values of @xmath2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> an additional uniaxial anisotropy , for large @xmath3 , can lead to distinct spin gaps in such systems , as also witnessed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the single hole spectral behavior in a 2d @xmath4 model , for small frustration , is then calculated within the non - crossing approximation . </S>",
    "<S> our results match fairly well with exact diagonalization results from a @xmath5 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> hole spectral features and their evolution with @xmath3 resulting in `` water - fall''-like smooth spectral weight transfer are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> hole energy bands are identified and the corresponding energy - shift and reduction in width with spin - frustration are indicated . </S>"
