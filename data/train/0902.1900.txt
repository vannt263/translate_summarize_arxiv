    "the mutual neutralization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the prototype reaction for electron transfer between two oppositely charged ions . with only two protons and two electrons involved",
    ", it is the simplest ion - ion reaction possible . here , calculations should be able to provide accurate results which could serve as benchmarks in the development of new theoretical methods and models .",
    "furthermore , the reactants have well defined quantum states and are relatively easy to prepare in the laboratory .",
    "a detailed comparison between experiment and theory should thus be possible and should provide a natural starting point to understanding more complicated ion - ion collision phenomena .",
    "however , the simplicity of this reaction is deceptive , a fact which has stimulated a large number of studies in the past .",
    "nevertheless , surprisingly few of these have investigated the neutralization cross section for collision energies below a few ev , which plays an important role in determining the @xmath1 abundance in low temperature ionized environments .",
    "a compelling example from astrophysics is its influence on the gas phase formation of @xmath7 , in particular in the chemistry of the primordial gas , where one of the main reaction paths involves @xmath1 as an intermediate  @xcite .",
    "bates and lewis  @xcite were the first to study the mutual neutralization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is written schematically as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the main quantum number of the excited hydrogen atom .",
    "their calculations were based on the semiclassical landau - zener model  @xcite in which the reaction is thought to proceed along a system of horizontal covalent potential energy curves crossed by an attractive ion - pair potential .",
    "this pioneering study was later followed by others , among them by olson _",

    "@xcite and more recently by eerden _",
    "et al . _",
    "fussen and kubach  @xcite have gone beyond the landau - zener concept and investigated the reaction at low collision energies using a one electron close - coupling model .",
    "the only measurement of the neutralization cross - section for collision energies below 3  ev is the merged beam experiment of moseley",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "their results seem to indicate a cross section that is approximately a factor of three higher than obtained in most of the cited theoretical studies . however , the theoretical results are mutually consistent and , for higher energies , also in more or less good agreement with the measurements reported by szucs _",

    "this intriguing situation has led to the suspicion that the low energy cross section of moseley _",
    "is overestimated  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report results of a fully quantum mechanical _ ab initio _ study of the reaction at hand .",
    "we are mainly concerned with the collision energy region 0.001 to 10  ev , but the calculations have been extended up to 100  ev in order to facilitate comparison with the cited experiments . the present study is based on a molecular close - coupling expansion of the total wave function .",
    "accurate electronic structure methods have been used to calculate adiabatic states and non - adiabatic couplings of both gerade and ungerade symmetry over a wide range of internuclear distances .",
    "subsequently , a transformation into a strictly diabatic representation has been performed and the diabatic quantities entered into a set of coupled equations for the motion of the nuclei . by numerically solving these equations , we have been able to calculate the neutralization cross sections for scattering within both the gerade and ungerade inversion symmetries .",
    "finally , the identity of the nuclei has been accounted for by properly combining the gerade and ungerade cross sections .",

    "these may be considered in two steps .",
    "firstly , since the charges of the nuclei that enter @xmath98 are equal , the electronic states will be either symmetric ( gerade ) or antisymmetric ( ungerade ) under inversion of @xmath99 .",
    "if the nuclei are labeled a and b , and @xmath100 represent groups of electrons in some definite quantum states , each asymptotic channel will be a linear combination of two configurations , say @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "such linear combinations can not describe the situation where a nucleus is known to carry a certain number of electrons in a certain quantum state ( unless @xmath103 ) .",
    "localization of the electron cloud can be achieved by forming proper linear combinations of the gerade and ungerade solutions .",

    "a second complication arises from the fact that also the masses of the nuclei are equal .",
    "consequently , it is impossible to distinguish direct scattering in the direction @xmath112 from exchange scattering in the direction @xmath113 .",
    "this effect can be accounted for by adding the direct and exchange amplitudes coherently .",
    "the fully symmetrized scattering amplitudes are  @xcite @xmath114 where the sign depends on whether the spatial part of the wave function should be symmetric  ( + ) or antisymmetric  ( - ) under exchange of the nuclei .",
    "to illustrate this point we consider a hydrogen quasi molecule where the two protons are known to be in a singlet spin state . according to the pauli principle ,",
    "the total wave function ( spin part included ) must be antisymmetric under exchange of the nuclei .",
    "since the singlet spin state itself is antisymmetric under such an operation , the spatial part of the wave function is forced to be symmetric .",

    "the calculations of wolniewicz and dressler do not extend out to the @xmath148 curve crossing and thus no direct comparison of the radial couplings can be made .",
    "however , in the ungerade symmetry we can compare the energy splitting of the 3 and 6@xmath3 states at @xmath170 . here",
    ", we obtain the value @xmath172 which is in very good agreement with the value @xmath173 calculated from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .      in order to obtain the adiabatic to diabatic transformation ( atdt ) matrix , we have numerically solved eq .",
    "( [ eq : atdte2 ] ) using the radial couplings described in the preceding section as input data .",
    "the solution has been obtained with a matrix version of the runge - kutta fehlberg method  @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath174 has been imposed at @xmath175 and the integration has been performed inwards . as hinted above , several of the non - adiabatic couplings are non - vanishing as @xmath29 tends to infinity . in practice",
    ", our choice of boundary condition corresponds to setting these couplings to zero beyond @xmath176 .",
    "since this kind of assumption has to be made in the calculation of the scattering matrix anyway , no additional error is introduced due to the diabatization procedure itself . in the present case ,",
    "the transformation to a strictly diabatic basis is merely for computational reasons and is not discussed further .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the diabatic potential energy curves we obtain here are far from the intuitive ones conventionally used in connection with the @xmath7 system , see figure  [ figure : potsdg ] .",
    "the logarithmic derivative  ( [ eq : ydef ] ) has been calculated by numerically solving the matrix riccati equation  ( [ eq : riceq ] ) from @xmath177 out to @xmath178 . for this purpose",
    "we have used an algorithm developed by johnson  @xcite with the grid size set to @xmath179 .",
    "knowledge of the logarithmic derivative in the final integration point has allowed us to calculate the partial cross sections  ( [ eq : partcs ] ) for scattering within the gerade and ungerade inversion symmetries .",
    "the fully symmetrized integral cross sections have been obtained by combining the partial cross sections according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2cs ] ) . to determine at which point the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h2cs ] ) could be truncated , a simple convergence criteria was introduced .",
    "this was set to terminate the summation if the ratios of the partial cross sections and the accumulated integral cross sections remained less than @xmath180 for 25 terms in succession . over the energy range considered here ,",
    "this led to the inclusion of approximately 250 to 3500 partial waves .",
    "the calculated cross sections for scattering into the @xmath5 , @xmath6 final states are shown in fig .  [ figure : crossstate ] .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath148 process dominates the others over almost the entire energy range , which is reasonable considering the favorable location of the @xmath148 curve crossing at around @xmath181 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath136 transitions occur much further in and are more easily suppressed by the centrifugal barrier . only for collision energies above @xmath182",
    "ev , where the @xmath136 cross section exhibits a minimum , is this process able to compete with neutralization into the @xmath148 final states .",
    "this phenomena was first noted by bates and lewis  @xcite and has been confirmed , at least on a qualitative level , by almost every study since then  @xcite .",
    "neutralization into the @xmath131 final state is insignificant at all energies and is included only for completeness . as the collision energy approaches zero , all cross sections gain the characteristic @xmath183 dependence that can be expected for reactions which are governed by the coulomb interaction . here ,",
    "the @xmath148 cross section is approximately a factor of  50 larger than the @xmath136 cross section .",
    "some weaker oscillations can be observed over a large part of the energy range .",
    "the reason for this structure is not completely clear , but the most likely explanation is in terms of stckelberg oscillations , i.e. , in terms of quantum interference arising because there are several competing routes through the potential landscape leading to the same asymptotic limit .",
    "the close - coupling results of fussen and kubach  @xcite have also been plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure : crossstate ] for comparison .",
    "the agreement between their @xmath148 cross section and the present one is good .",
    "the difference is about 20  percent at 1  ev and increases slightly with the energy . comparing the @xmath136 cross sections , the two calculations are seen to agree well above the minimum at 5  ev , whereas at lower energies the differences are more pronounced .",
    "a rationale for this discrepancy may be found by considering how the inversion symmetry of the electronic states is approached .    for this purpose",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ figure : crossgu ] a comparison of our fully symmetrized cross sections ( same as in fig .",
    "[ figure : crossstate ] ) together with the pure gerade and ungerade cross sections calculated in the conventional way .",
    "we first note that the @xmath148 cross section is fairly insensitive to the choice of inversion symmetry over the whole energy range .",
    "consequently , the effect of averaging over these symmetries is expected to be small .",
    "a similar observation can be made regarding the @xmath136 cross section above 5  ev .",
    "however , at lower energies the gerade and ungerade results differ strongly .",
    "this indicates not only that our way of combining the gerade and ungerade cross sections will affect the final result , but also that any two approaches that treat the inversion symmetry differently may lead to different outcomes . in the one electron model of fussen and kubach , this inversion symmetry is actually broken and as a consequence their results are likely to differ from ours .",
    "it should be emphasized though , that at the energies where this happens the contribution from the @xmath136 channels to the overall reaction is small .",
    "it should also be noted that the effects of treating the nuclei as indistinguishable are very small , and it is equally good to use the simpler formula  ( [ eq : h2cs2 ] ) in favor of ( [ eq : h2cs ] ) to weight the gerade and ungerade partial cross sections .      in fig .",
    "[ figure : crosstot ] we show the calculated total neutralization cross section , i.e. , the sum of the @xmath6 cross sections . as could be expected from the previous subsection",
    ", this cross section shows a rather smooth behavior over the entire energy range . at low collision energies",
    ", the curve approximately resembles the @xmath183 behavior discussed above .",
    "the cross section then continues to fall off until it reaches a broad minimum at around 20 ev .",
    "this minimum obviously results from the nearly constant @xmath148 cross section in combination with the rapid increase in the formation of @xmath136 final products .    to examine the influence of the non - vanishing asymptotic couplings upon the cross section , the point at which the logarithmic derivative is evaluated has been varied over the range 50 to @xmath142 .",
    "the boundary condition on the atdt matrix has been varied accordingly . at the collision energies 0.001 ,",
    "1 and 100 ev , the relative variation in the cross section was seen to be @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively . we conclude that the effects of the non - vanishing asymptotic couplings over the energy range considered here are negligible .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions drawn by borondo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "additional tests have been performed in order to estimate the relevance of the radial couplings at small internuclear distances ( as discussed in sec .",
    "[ level2:pes ] ) .",
    "this has been done by setting all radial couplings up to a certain distance  @xmath187 to zero before the diabatization procedure is carried out .",
    "choosing @xmath188 reduces the total neutralization cross section at 0.001 , 1 and 100 ev collision energy by 8.6 , 9.9 and 5.9 percent , respectively .",
    "these variations in the cross section can be considered small ( although not insignificant ) and may be taken as an upper limit for the influence of the higher lying @xmath137 adiabatic states not included in the present study , which are coupled to the lower lying states mainly at small internuclear distances .",
    "a more detailed study of these effects is currently being pursued .    in fig .",
    "[ figure : crosstot ] we also show the results of earlier studies relevant for the mutual neutralization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at low collision energies . up to the present date ,",
    "no measurements of this cross section have been reported for collision energies below 0.15  ev . in the region 0.15 to 3  ev , the only experimental results that are available are those of moseley _",

    "@xcite and peart and hayton  @xcite , among others . in the region 3",
    "to 10  ev , their results point towards a cross section that is slightly lower than ours , which is most evident for the first few data points of peart and hayton , whereas for collision energies above 10  ev all three studies agree favorably . comparing with earlier theoretical studies , our results match within 30 percent the close - coupling calculations of fussen and kubach  @xcite and within 40 percent the landau - zener calculations of bates and lewis  @xcite .",
    "our results also more or less overlap with the landau - zener results obtained by eerden _",
    "et al . _",
    ".    it may be worthwhile to review the accumulated data on the mutual neutralization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at low collision energies ( below a few ev ) .",
    "there are now several calculations of this cross section that are mutually consistent within a few tens of percent .",
    "these employ such diverse methods as semi - classical landau - zener theory as well as model hamiltonian and _ ab initio _ close - coupling schemes . in the upper part of the energy region , the theoretical results are in more or less agreement with several of the available experiments .",
    "one of these might even suggest a cross section that is slightly lower than predicted by theory .",
    "it is a fact , however , that the only measurement that has been published for collision energies below 3  ev shows a cross section that is considerably higher than others reported .",
    "to clarify this situation , new experimental efforts are obviously required .",
    "recently such measurements have been undertaken by the group of urbain  @xcite at the universit catholique de louvain , belgium , using a merged beam apparatus in the energy range 0.001 to 0.2  ev .",
    "although uncertainties of the order of 50 percent still exist , preliminary results from this experiment seem to support the neutralization cross section obtained from the various theoretical treatments .      at low collision energies",
    ", the total neutralization cross section may be parametrized in terms of the relative velocity  @xmath189 as  @xcite @xmath190 to determine the unknown coefficients of this expression , we have performed a least square fit to our calculated cross section in the region 0.001 to 4  ev .",

    "furthermore , a proper weighting of the gerade and ungerade cross sections turns out to be important only for the @xmath136 formation at low collision energies , where these cross sections anyway are small . in the collision energy region below a few ev , our total neutralization cross section is in good agreement with previous theoretical studies  @xcite , but is a factor of two to three lower than that measured by moseley _",
