    "charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) is an important aspect in the ccd development for operation in high energy physics colliders  @xcite .",
    "the lcfi collaboration has been developing new ccd chips and testing them for about 10 years  @xcite .",
    "recently the focus of the simulations has been on ccds with column parallel readout ( cpccd ) .",

    "an example of the cti temperature dependence is shown in fig .",

    "full tcad simulations are very cpu intensive .",
    "this has already been noted for the ccd simulations with a sequential readout  @xcite .",
    "the cti depends on many parameters , such as readout frequency and operating temperature .",
    "some parameters are related to the trap characteristics like trap energy level , capture cross - section and trap concentration ( density ) .",
    "other factors are also relevant , such as the occupancy of the pixels ( hits ) .",
    "it is well known that analytic charge transfer models can be used to study the cti dependence on readout frequency and operating temperature  @xcite . for a comparison with full tcad cti simulation results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctivstemp_tcad ] , we have developed analytic models for the cpccd  @xcite .",
    "the further development of these analytic models leads also to better understanding of the relevant parameters in order to reduce the cti in future cpccd prototypes .",
    "this paper addresses the inclusion of signal shape and clock voltage amplitude which leads to an improved analytic model for a cpccd .",
    "the cti obtained from the improved analytic model is compared with results from full tcad simulations .",

    "the analytic models  @xcite describe the different steps in the charge transfer process and the amount of the trapped charge with respect to the charge cloud in transfer .",
