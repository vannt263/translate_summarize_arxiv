    "<S> this paper focuses on accelerating quantum optimal control design for complex quantum systems . based on our previous work [ arxiv:1607.04054 ] , </S>",
    "<S> we combine pulse width modulation ( pwm ) and gradient descent algorithm into solving quantum optimal control problems , which shows distinct improvement of computational efficiency in various cases . to further apply this algorithm to potential experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we also propose the smooth realization of the optimized control solution , e.g. using gaussian pulse train to replace rectangular pulses . based on the experimental data of the d - norleucine molecule </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically find optimal control functions in @xmath0-qubit and @xmath1-qubit systems , and demonstrate its efficiency advantage compared with basic grape algorithm . </S>"
