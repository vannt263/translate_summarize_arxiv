    "data taken over the last several years have demonstrated that rhic has created dense and rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by : 1 ) initial energy densities far above the critical values predicted by lattice qcd for formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ; 2 ) opacity to jets ; and 3 ) nearly ideal fluid flow , which is marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path , established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation  @xcite .",
    "the next objective at rhic is to study properties of this partonic matter in detail in terms of color degrees of freedom and the equation of state .",
    "for example , due to color screening , different quarkonium states will dissociate and the dissociation temperatures will be different due to different binding energies . the precise measurement of transverse momentum distributions of quarkonia at different centralities , collision systems , and energies will serve as a thermometer of qgp . a large - area muon telescope detector ( mtd ) at mid - rapidity for rhic collisions will be crucial for advancing our knowledge of qgp properties .",
    "it will directly address many of the open questions and long - term goals proposed in the rhic white papers  @xcite . since muons do not participate in strong interactions , they provide penetrating probes for the strongly - interacting qgp .",
    "a large area detector identifying muons with momentum of a few gev/@xmath2 at mid - rapidity allows for the detection of di - muon pairs from qgp thermal radiation , quarkonia , light vector mesons , possible correlations of quarks and gluons as resonances in qgp , and drell - yan production , as well as the measurement of heavy flavor hadrons through their semi - leptonic decays into single muons  @xcite .",
    "some of these topics also can be studied using electrons or photons or a combination of both .",
    "however , electrons and photons have large backgrounds from hadron decays , @xmath5 and @xmath6 dalitz decays , and gamma conversions in the detector material .",
    "these backgrounds prevent effective triggering in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at mid - rapidity at the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) .",
    "in addition , electron - muon correlation can be used to distinguish between lepton pair production and heavy quark decays ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "in addition , muons are less affected by bremsstrahlung radiation energy loss in the detector materials than electrons , thus providing excellent mass resolution of vector mesons and quarkonia .",
    "this is essential for separating the ground state ( 1s ) of @xmath4 from its excited states ( 2s+3s ) .",
    "they are predicted to melt at very different temperatures .",
    "conventional muon detectors rely heavily on tracking stations , while this new detector proposes to use @xmath9 ps timing and @xmath10 cm spatial resolution to identify muons with momentum of a few gev/@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "multi - gap resistive plate chamber technology with large modules , long strips and double - ended readout ( long - mrpc ) was used for mtd prototype detectors .",
    "similar technology but with small pads has been constructed and installed at star as a time - of - flight detector ( tof )  @xcite . in this report",
    "we present the conceptual design for the star mtd , the r@xmath11d results including the intrinsic timing and spatial resolution of long - mrpc , and the mtd prototype performance at star . the muon identification capability and hadron background rejection are reported .",
    "future perspectives for physics programs utilizing such detectors are discussed .",
    "the star detector was used for these studies  @xcite . the detector layout is shown in fig .  [ stardetector ] .",
    "the main tracking device is the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , whose inner and outer field cages are located at radial distances of 50 and 200 cm respectively from the beam axis . the tpc is 4 meters long and it covers a pseudorapidity range @xmath12 and 2@xmath13 in azimuth .",
    "the ionization energy loss ( @xmath14 ) is used for particle identification  @xcite . a tof detector based on multi - gap resistive plate chambers ( mrpc )  @xcite",
    "will be fully installed in star in 2009 , covering @xmath15 in azimuth and @xmath16 in pseudorapidity at a radius of @xmath17 cm .",
    "it will extend particle identification up to @xmath18 gev/@xmath2 for @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the full barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) is installed outside the tof radius and uniformly covers @xmath16 in pseudorapidity and @xmath15 in azimuth  @xcite .",
    "the tpc is centered in a solenoidal magnetic field provided by the surrounding magnetic coils .",
    "the return flux path for the field is provided by the magnet steel  @xcite , which is roughly cylindrical in geometry and consists of 30 flux return bars , four end rings and two poletips .",
    "the 6.85 m long flux return bars are trapezoidal in cross - section and 60 cm thick with a 363 cm outer radius .",
    "the width at the outer radius of the return bar is 57 cm .        the simulation of a full hijing central au+au collision is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , using star geometry with a configuration of all the detectors and a complete material budget .",
    "we simulated a muon - detector ( in blue ) covering the full return bars ( in green ) within @xmath21 and left the gaps in - between return bars uncovered .",
    "this detector acceptance corresponds to 56% of @xmath15 in azimuth . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , it can be seen that most of the particles are stopped before the bemc and the few escaping particles ( primary or secondary ) mainly come through the gaps between the return bars .",
    "further simulation  @xcite with star geometry indicates that for a muon with @xmath22 gev/@xmath2 generated in the center of the tpc , the detection efficiency of the mtd , including acceptance effects , is about 40 - 50% , while for a pion track , the efficiency is 0.5 - 1% . in this simulation ,",
    "the charged tracks reconstructed in the tpc are extrapolated to the mtd , and required to match the hit position as well as the time - of - flight from mtd measurements .",
    "we require the distance between the mtd hit and the projected point from the track to be within 4 cm and the timing difference to be less than 400 ps .",
    "it should be noted that in this study , a simple helix extrapolation of the track to the mtd was employed while in reality , the magnetic flux return bar has a magnetic field of 1.2 telsa while the tpc has a 0.5 telsa field .",
    "pion and kaon misidentifications come mainly from their decay into muons before the absorption by the return bar .",
    "these daughter muons then penetrate the return bars to reach the mtd .",
    "it is also evident from the simulations that protons are reduced by a much larger factor than pions and kaons . shown in fig .",
    "[ figeff ] is the combined acceptance and efficiency for primary muons , pions , kaons and protons .",
    "it indicates that the mtd can detect muons of @xmath23 gev/@xmath2 at a level of 45% while less than 1% of overall hadrons are accepted taking into account the relative yields of pions , kaons and protons .",
    "this illustrates that the mtd detector can reject hadrons effectively .",
    "a rejection factor of 50 - 100 can be obtained based on the simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ figeff ] while maintaining an efficient trigger ( @xmath24 ) for prompt muons .",
    "further hadron rejection can be achieved with tracking in the tpc , @xmath14 in the tpc and hit matching in the tof .",

    "we utilize long - mrpcs for the detector design .",
    "each long - mrpc module consists of two stacks of resistive glass plates resulting in a combined total of ten uniform gas gaps with gap widths of 250 @xmath27 m .",
    "high voltage is applied to electrodes on the outer surfaces of the outer plates of each stack . a charged particle traversing a module generates avalanches in the gas gaps which are read out by six copper pickup strips with strip dimensions of @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the mrpc modules were operated at 12.6 kv with a mixture of 95% @xmath30 and 5% iso - butane at 1 atmosphere . in the high voltage range @xmath31 kv ,",
    "the efficiency is above 95% and timing resolution is about 60 - 70 ps in the cosmic ray and beam tests .",

    "in addition , discriminator outputs from the digitizer boards with thresholds set to 30 mv were routed to a time - to - analog convertor ( tac ) , which was gated by the rhic accelerator clock .",
    "the tac signals were sent to a different channel of the digitizer board .",
    "both adc and tac values were routed through the trigger distribution and processing system for an initial ( level 0 ) trigger decision  @xcite .",
    "the level 0 ( l0 ) trigger is generated in less than 1.5 us from all the fast detector information available to trigger and is used to start the digitization process on slower detector systems ( e.g. tpc ) .",
    "we have not required time difference or any other matching algorithms for a trigger decision as discussed in the simulation .",

    "furthermore , from p+p mtd triggered events taken in year 2008 , we found that the inclusive muon yields can be decreased by a factor of 2 by requiring a coincidence with a valid hit in the tof system in the same tpc sector .",
    "we not only use several detectors ( tpc , tof and mtd ) to improve the muon identification , but also use additional detectors to check the performance of hadron rejection .",
    "one of the methods is to use hadronic showers in the bemc to study the fraction of inclusive muon candidates from hadron showers starting at the emc and penetrating the absorbers . only a few percent of hadrons produce showers and deposit energy above the minimum ionization energy ( mip ) in the bemc .",
    "table  [ mip ] shows the fraction of hadrons with energy deposited in the bemc greater than 0.75 gev with and without any mtd hit associated . there is a factor of @xmath59 reduction of hadronic shower in the bemc when we require muon candidacy in the mtd .",
    "since the electron yield is about 0.1% of the inclusive hadron yield in year 2008 in 200 gev p+p collisions at star  @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that all the bemc showers with a tpc track are hadrons when a mtd hit is not associated .",
    "this means that the contribution from hadrons was reduced from @xmath60 to @xmath61 while that from muons ( both prompt and from hadron decays ) increased to @xmath62 of the remaining sample . by comparing the difference between the bemc showers with and without the mtd hit requirement ,",
    "we conclude that particles which arrive at the bemc when there is a valid mtd hit in coincidence are indeed mostly dominated by muons .",

    ", hadron decays or dalitz decays ) .",
    "the estimate is made with and without cuts on the ionization energy loss ( relative to that expected for a pion ) in the tpc for the track projected to the position of the mtd . since the de / dx for a muon in the relevant momentum range is higher than that for a pion , increasing the cut on @xmath58 results in a higher fraction of prompt muons ( top panel ) ; the contribution from pion decays to the measured inclusive muon signal as a function of @xmath26 , determined by measuring the mtd response when a pion from a @xmath54 decay enters its acceptance ( bottom panel ) . ]    since the prompt muons are predominantly from charm semi - leptonic decay , we compare our muon yields to non - photonic electron yields in the same @xmath26 bin to assess the muon contamination from pion and kaon decays .",

    "<S> we propose a large - area , cost - effective muon telescope detector ( mtd ) at mid - rapidity for the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) and for the next generation of detectors at a possible electron - ion collider . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize large multi - gap resistive plate chambers with long readout strips ( long - mrpc ) in the detector design . the results from cosmic ray and </S>",
    "<S> beam tests show the intrinsic timing and spatial resolution for a long - mrpc are @xmath0 ps and @xmath1 cm , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the prototype muon telescope detector at star indicates that muon identification at a transverse momentum of a few gev/@xmath2 can be achieved by combining information from track matching with the mtd , ionization energy loss in the time projection chamber , and time - of - flight measurements . a primary muon over secondary muon ratio of better than 1/3 can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a promising device for future quarkonium programs and primordial dilepton measurements at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the muon efficiency , the signal - to - background ratio of @xmath3 , the separation of @xmath4 1s from 2s+3s states , and the electron - muon correlation from charm pair production in the rhic environment are presented .    </S>",
