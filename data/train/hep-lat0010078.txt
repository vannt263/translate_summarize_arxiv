    "recent progress in lattice calculations of the quenched light hadron spectrum  @xcite has demonstrated clearly that effects of dynamical sea quarks have to be included for a precision comparison with the experimental spectrum . as a first step towards the real world",
    "we have pursued a systematic calculation in two - flavor qcd over the last 3 years  @xcite . in this article",
    "we present a summary of the final results on the light hadron spectrum and quark masses from this calculation .    in order to deal with the increased demand in computer time for full qcd we have used an rg - improved gauge action and a tadpole - improved sw clover quark action , which allows us to simulate at coarse lattices in the range @xmath10.11 fm  @xcite . since lattice99  @xcite we have doubled the statistics at the smallest lattice spacing on a @xmath7 lattice , with which we have reached our planned target of three lattice spacings , each with a similar amount of statistics at each simulated sea quark mass .",
    "the final parameters of our simulations are summarized in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "we have also made a set of simulations in quenched qcd using the same improved actions in the same range of lattice spacings and with a similar range of quark masses .",
    "this allows us to compare in detail spectrum results in full and quenched qcd and to make an independent confirmation of the findings in quenched qcd in ref .",

    "these expressions show that the magnitude of one - loop corrections is about 10% .",
    "one loop corrections in improvement coefficients have a similar size . to estimate further corrections from higher order terms , we compare results for two definitions of the mean - field improved coupling constant : @xmath11 , appropriate for the rg - improved gluon action and alternatively @xmath12 . for the matching scale we use the two values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
