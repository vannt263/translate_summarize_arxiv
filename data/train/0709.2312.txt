    "recent advances in experimental investigations of hadron structure arouse the interest in the theoretical study of the hadron electromagnetic form factors at high momentum transfers ( see e.g. review @xcite and references therein ) . in this connection",

    "in general , high momentum transfers require relativistic consideration",
    ". however we begin the consideration of the asymptotic estimation of electromagnetic deuteron form factors with the nonrelativistic case and nonrelativistic impulse approximation at @xmath3 .",

    "in the nonrelativistic impulse approximation known formulas for electromagnetic deuteron form factors can be rewritten in the following way @xcite : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 here @xmath90 are the deuteron wave functions in momentum representation , @xmath91 0,2 are orbital angular momenta , @xmath92 are nonrelativistic free two - particles charge , quadrupole and magnetic dipole form factors , @xmath93 is the deuteron mass .",
    "formulas for @xmath94 are given in @xcite .",
    "let us discuss briefly possible types of the model deuteron wave functions .",

    "but independently of the method any wave function can be represented as the following laguerre polynomial expansion @xcite : @xmath96 or in the coordinate representation : @xmath97 here @xmath98 are generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath99 is an euler gamma function , the dimensional parameter @xmath100 can be related to the deuteron matter radius ( see sec .",
    "the wave function representation as a laguerre polynomial expansion ( [ funcu ] ) is very useful for the calculation of the asymptotic behavior of the form factors .",
    "however , one can avoid such representation and obtain the asymptotic expansion directly for the initial wave function .",
    "generally , at high transferred momentum it is necessary to take into account relativistic corrections in the electromagnetic deuteron structure . in our paper relativistic description of the deuteron",
    "is constructed in the framework of instant form of poincare - invariant quantum mechanics ( piqm ) , developed by authors previously @xcite . in this approach",
    "we present electromagnetic deuteron form factors by analogy with nonrelativistic case ( [ gqgnip ] ) .",
    "corresponding formulas in the relativistic impulse approximation were obtained in our paper @xcite : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the deuteron wave functions in sense of piqm , @xmath105 @xmath106 are relativistic free two - particles charge , quadrupole and magnetic dipole form factors .",
    "formulas for free form factors are given in @xcite .",
    "the deuteron wave functions in sense of piqm are solutions of eigenvalue problem for a mass squared operator for the deuteron ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath107 an eigenvalue problem for this operator is coincident with the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation within a second order on deuteron binding energy @xmath108 , the value of which is small ( @xmath109 is an averaged nucleon mass ) .",
    "so the deuteron wave functions in sense of piqm differ from nonrelativistic wave functions by conditions of normalization only . in the relativistic case",
    "the wave functions are normalized with relativistic density of states : @xmath110{s}\\,k\\,u_l(k)\\;,\\quad s=4(k^{2}+m^{2})\\;.\\label{relnorm}\\ ] ]    nonrelativistic formulas eq .",
    "( [ gqgnip ] ) can be obtained from relativistic ones ( [ gqgrip ] ) in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this limiting procedure can be performed in the most natural way in the instant form of piqm .",
    "the reason is that in papers @xcite we have constructed the successful formalism of the instant form of piqm . in the case of other forms of piqm ( point and front forms )",
    "the obtaining of nonrelativistic limit is much more difficult .    for obtaining the asymptotic form factors behavior at high transferred momentum in the nonrelativistic and relativistic cases it is necessary to estimate asymptotically double integrals ( [ gqgnip ] ) and ( [ gqgrip ] ) at @xmath111 .",
    "notice that integrands reach its maximum value at the integration domain bound , and this point is not a point of extremum . in the previous section the theorem defining asymptotics of @xmath4-tuple integrals of such kind was proven .",
    "we start asymptotic expansion of the deuteron form factors from the nonrelativistic case .",
    "it is caused by the simplicity of the nonrelativistic formulas , so the calculation of the asymptotics is more clear . in",
    "what follows the relativistic calculation will be presented analogous to the nonrelativistic one , although more combersome .",
    "moreover nonrelativistic calculation is interesting because nonrelativistic formulas for the form factors ( [ gqgnip ] ) are conventional , that is why its correct asymptotic expansion has universal significance .",
    "let us emphasize also that the relativistic expressions for form factors and , therefore , their asymptotic estimations depend on the choice of the method of relativisation of the two - nucleon model .",
    "nonrelativistic calculation is also of interest because it helps to clarify the role of relativistic effects in the electromagnetic structure of the deuteron at the asymptotical momentum transfers .    as we have seen in sec . 3",
    ", the deuteron form factors in the nonrelativistic impulse approximation can be represented by double integrals ( [ gqgnip ] ) .",
    "we will find its asymptotic expansion using the theorem of section 2 and use as an example the asymptotics of the charge form factor .",
    "we shall estimate only the @xmath112 term in the sum ( [ gqgnip ] ) because the asymptotics of the other terms of form factors ( [ gqgnip ] ) can be derived analogously .",

    "let us perform the transition to the new basis as we have descripted before .",
    "we perform the shift of the origin of coordinates to the point of maximal value of the function @xmath122 .",
