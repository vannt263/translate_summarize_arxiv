    "the lovelock action @xmath18 reduces to the einstein - hilbert action in four dimensions , and its second term is the gauss - bonnet invariant .",
    "lovelock theories are distinct , among the larger class of general higher - curvature theories , in having field equations involving not more than second derivatives of the metric .",
    "consequently , lovelock gravity theories are free from many of the pathologies that affect general higher derivative gravity theories .    as higher - dimensional members of einstein s",
    "general relativity family , lovelock gravities allow us to explore several conceptual issues of gravity in depth in a broader setup .",
    "most interestingly , one can include features of black holes such as their existence and uniqueness theorems , their thermodynamics , the definitions of their mass and entropy , their horizon properties , etc .",
    "also , such a theory may be used in the context of the ads / cft correspondence to investigate the effects of including higher - curvature terms @xcite .",
    "it has , therefore , been explored to a large extent , also possibly for its appearance in strings theories at low energies @xcite . in this paper , we will be concerned with the black hole solutions of this lovelock theory , and we will discuss how higher - curvature corrections to black hole physics substantially change the qualitative features we know from our experience with black holes in general relativity . since their inception , steady attention has been devoted to black hole solutions , including their formation , stability , and thermodynamics . the spherically symmetric static black hole solution for second - order lovelock gravity ( the theory that is usually referred as the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory )",
    "was first obtained by boulware and deser @xcite , and this kind of solution for third - order lovelock gravity was introduced in ref .",
    "exact black hole solutions of the former can be found in ref . @xcite and the latter in refs .",
    "the black hole solution in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory in a string cloud model was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the recent theoretical developments signal toward a scenario in which the fundamental building blocks of the universe are extended objects instead of point objects and have been considered quite seriously @xcite .",
    "the most natural and popular candidate is one - dimensional strings object .",
    "this resulted in the intense level of activity towards the study of the gravitational effects of matter in the form of clouds of both cosmic and fundamental strings @xcite .",
    "in addition , the intense level of activity in string theory has led to the idea that many of the classic vacuum schemes , such as the static schwarzschild black hole ( point mass ) , may have atmospheres composed of a fluid or field of strings .",
    "further , this two - fluid atmosphere can model an array of physical situations at diverse distance scales , which can depict the atmosphere around a black hole with a distance scale of multiples of schwarzschild radii .",
    "it could also describe a globular cluster with components of a dark matter at a scale tuned to the order of parsecs .",
    "the event horizon for the classical schwarzschild metric in the background of a cloud of strings has a modified radius @xmath19 with @xmath20 as a string cloud parameter @xcite , thereby enlarging the schwarzschild radius of the black hole by the factor @xmath21 , which may have several astrophysical consequences , e.g. , on a wormhole @xcite .",
    "further , glass and krisch @xcite have demonstrated that allowing the schwarzschild mass to be a function of radial position builds an atmosphere with a string fluid stress energy around a static , spherically symmetric , object .",
    "thus , the study of einstein s equations coupled with a string cloud , in both general relativity and modified theories , may be very important because relativistic strings at a classical level can be used to construct applicable models @xcite .",
    "intense activity of studying black hole solutions in modified theories of gravity including lovelock theories of gravity is due to the fact that , besides theoretical results , cosmological evidence , e.g. , dark matter and dark energy , the possibility of modification of the einstein gravity is suggested .",
    "many other authors have found exact black hole solutions with a string cloud background , for instance , in general relativity @xcite , in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , and also in lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to obtain an exact black hole solution in second- and third - order lovelock theories with a cloud of strings in the background .",
    "we shall present a class of black hole solutions endowed with a cloud of strings .",
    "in particular , we explicitly bring out how the effect of the background string cloud can alter black hole solutions and their properties as we know from our knowledge of black holes in general relativity .",
    "our attention will be given to the second - order einstein - gauss - bonnet case , which exhibits most of the relevant qualitative features .",
    "we obtain @xmath22-dimensional static spherically symmetric black hole solutions in a string cloud background with the three terms of lovelock gravity that are einstein or general relativity , gauss - bonnet and third - order lovelock terms .",
    "we analyze their thermodynamic properties and also perform a stability analysis the for einstein - gauss - bonnet case .",
    "lovelock gravity is the most general second - order gravity theory in higher - dimensional spacetimes , which is free of ghosts @xcite .",
    "the lovelock tensor is nonlinear in the riemann tensor and nontrivially differs from the einstein tensor only if @xmath23 .",

    "note that for third - order lovelock gravity , the nontrivial third term requires that the dimension of spacetime should satisfy @xmath41 .",

    "lovelock theory coincides with einstein theory @xcite , e.g. , for @xmath94 , we get@xmath95 which clearly is independent of @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and therefore it will be the einstein equation in four dimensions admitting the solution @xmath98 this solution was first obtained by letelier @xcite , and the metric represents the black hole spacetime associated with a spherical mass @xmath43 centered at the origin of the system of coordinates , surrounded by a spherical cloud of strings .",
    "the event horizon of the metric is placed at @xmath99 . in the limit @xmath100",

    "the event horizon radius tends to infinity . on the other hand",
    ", a cloud of strings alone ( @xmath101 ) does not have a horizon ; it represents only a naked singularity at @xmath102 .",
    "besides , the metric ( [ metric ] ) with ( [ lfour dimensions ] ) can be understood as the metric associated with a global monopole .",
    "but in higher dimensions , the lovelock theories are actually different .",
    "in fact , for @xmath103 , einstein gravity can be thought of as a particular case of lovelock gravity since the einstein - hilbert term is one of several terms that constitute the lovelock action .",
    "hence , for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath105 which admits the solution @xmath106 we also observe that the four - dimensional solution ( [ lfour dimensions ] ) is recovered in the limit @xmath107 . the integration constant @xmath43 in eq .  ( [ ndsol ] )",
    "is related to the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath108 via @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the volume of the @xmath72-dimensional unit sphere .    to study the general structure of the solution given by ( [ eehd ] ) , we look for the essential singularity .",
    "it is seen that the kretschmann scalar ( @xmath111 ) for the metric ( [ metric ] ) reduces to @xmath112which on inserting ( [ eehd ] ) becomes @xmath113 the kretschmann scalar ( [ ks ] ) diverges as @xmath114 , indicating the scalar polynomial or essential singularity at @xmath115 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the metric ( [ metric ] ) is well behaved even if @xmath116 , as ( [ ks ] ) indicates .    in the higher - dimensional case ,",
    "a fact that deserves to be emphasized is that a cloud of strings alone , unlike in four dimensions , can have an event horizon located at @xmath117 .",
    "thus , we have extended the letelier @xcite solutions to higher - dimensional spacetime .",
    "now , we look for the existence of event horizons , and therefore for possible black hole solutions .",
    "the horizons , if they exist , are given by zeros of @xmath118 .",
    "the black hole horizon of the solution ( [ eehd ] ) is located at , e.g. , in the five - dimensional case , @xmath119 and at @xmath120 with @xmath121 for six - dimensional case .",
    "we note that the gravitational mass of a black hole is determined by @xmath122 , which , from equation  ( [ ndsol ] ) , reads @xmath123equation  ( [ mass ] ) , takes the form of the @xmath22-dimensional schwarzschild black hole when @xmath124 .        in @xmath22-dimensional spacetime , we can see the roles of both second- and third - order lovelock parameters simultaneously . a simplifying , yet interesting case in the solution ( [ sol : ll ] ) can be obtained if @xmath125 the metric function @xmath75 reads simply@xmath126 with @xmath127 in figs .",
