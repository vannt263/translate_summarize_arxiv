    "neutron stars are observed as several classes of self - gravitating systems : as radio and x - ray pulsars , as x - ray bursters , as compact thermal x - ray sources in supernova remnants , as rotating radio transients . in general ,",
    "the structure of neutron stars and the relation between the mass and the radius are determined by equations of state ( eos ) of dense matter .",
    "the maximal mass of neutron star is still an open question .",
    "recent observations allows to estimate this limit at least as @xmath7 : the well - measured limit of the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 is @xmath8 @xcite , while , for the pulsar j0348 + 0432 , it is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other examples of massive neutron stars are vela x-1 ( @xmath10 @xcite ) and 4u 1822 - 371 ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) .",
    "there are some indications in favor of the existence of more massive neutron stars with masses @xmath12 ( the possible masses of b1957 + 20 @xcite and 4u 1700 - 377 @xcite ) or even @xmath13 ( j1748 - 2021b @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for various eos including hyperons , the maximal mass limit for non - magnetic neutron stars is considerably below than of the two - solar masses limit .",
    "the hyperonization process softens eos and then the maximal allowable mass results reduced @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to approach the solution of this problem ( the so called `` _ hyperon puzzle _ '' ) .",
    "firstly , the extensions of the simple model of hyperonic matter ( with three exchange meson fields - the so called @xmath14-model ) allow to achieve the increasing of maximal mass .",
    "various approaches are proposed following this track .",
    "for instance , larger hyperon - vector couplings ( in comparison with quark counting rule ) require stiffness of the eos @xcite .",
    "similar effect occurs in model with chiral quark - meson coupling @xcite .",
    "the quartic vector - meson terms in the lagrangian @xcite or the inclusion of an additional vector - meson mediating repulsive interaction amongst hyperons @xcite also lead to the increasing of the maximal mass limit .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite proposed an eos with maximum mass @xmath15 using the quark - meson coupling model , which naturally incorporates hyperons without additional parameters . a model with in - medium hyperon interactions",
    "is considered in @xcite .",
    "another source for increasing the maximal mass limit is the existence of strong magnetic fields inside the star .",
    "the existence of soft gamma - ray repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars can be linked to neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields of the order @xmath16 g on the surface . in these cases ,",
    "the maximum magnetic field in the central regions of neutron star can exceed @xmath17 g , according to the scalar virial theorem .",
    "such magnetic fields affect considerably the eos for dense matter and result in increasing the maximal mass of neutron stars .",
    "various models of dense nuclear matter in presence of strong magnetic fields have been considered in literature . the simplest model with interacting @xmath18 gas",
    "is investigated in @xcite .",
    "models with hyperons and quarks are considered in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the landau quantization leads to the softening of the eos for matter but account for contributions of magnetic field into pressure and density .",
    "this fact leads , on the other hand , to the stiffening of eos .",
    "therefore neutron stars are very peculiar objects for testing theories of matter at high density regimes and in strong magnetic fields .",
    "it is interesting to note that data about neutron stars ( mainly mass - radius ( @xmath19 ) relation ) can be used for investigating possible deviations from general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the initial motivation for studying modified gravity came from the discovered accelerated expansion of the universe confirmed by numerous independent observations .",
    "these observations include hubble diagram for ia type supernovae @xcite , cosmic microvawe background radiation ( cmbr ) data @xcite , surveys of gravitational weak lensing @xcite and data on lyman alpha forest absorption lines @xcite .",
    "this acceleration takes place at relatively small distances ( `` hubble flow '' ) and requires ( in gr ) non - standard cosmic fluid ( dark energy ) filling the universe with negative pressure but not clustered in large scale structure .",
    "the nature of dark energy is unclear .",
    "although from an observational viewpoint , the so called @xmath20cdm model ( where dark energy is considered as einstein cosmological constant ) is in agreement with data coming from observations there are various problems and shortcomings at theoretical level .",
    "one of this issues is the `` smallness '' of cosmological constant i.e. the difference of 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and the one predicted by quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to dark energy problem consists of extending of gr . in this case",
    ", the accelerated expansion can be obtained without using `` dark energy '' but enlarging the gravitational sector @xcite .",
    "therefore theories of modified gravity can be considered as real alternative to gr .",
    "the study of relativistic stars in modified gravity is interesting from several reasons and could constitute a formidable probe for such theories .",
    "firstly one can reject some models that do not allow the existence of stable star configurations @xcite ( however one has to note that stability can be achieved due to `` chameleon mechanism '' @xcite and may depend on the choice of the eos ) .",
    "secondly there is the possibility for the existence of new stellar structures , in the framework of modified gravity , escaping the standard stellar models .",
    "the observation of such self - gravitating anomalous structures could provide strong evidence for the extended gravity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to neutron stars with strong magnetic fields in framework of analytic @xmath0 gravity . assuming",
    "a simple model for strong interactions , one can obtain the eos for dense matter in magnetic field .",
    "landau quantization , due to magnetic fields , results to have significant effects .",
    "we consider the cases of slowly and fast varying fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iv , the neutron star models for strong magnetic fields in quadratic ( @xmath21 ) and cubic @xmath22 gravity are presented .",
