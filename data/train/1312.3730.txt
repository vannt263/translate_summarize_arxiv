    "initially introduced in @xcite in order to justify the quantum langevin equations , quantum repeated interaction models are currently a very active line of research .",
    "they have found various applications : quantum trajectories @xcite , thermalization of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "moreover several famous physical experiments , such as the ones performed by s. haroche s team , correspond exactly to quantum repeated interaction schemes ( @xcite ) .    repeated quantum interactions are particular discrete time evolutions of open quantum systems where the typical situation is the one of a quantum system @xmath6 in contact with an infinite chain of quantum systems @xmath7 . each quantum system",
    "@xmath8 interacts with @xmath6 one after the other during a time duration @xmath9 .",
    "more concretely , @xmath10 interacts with @xmath6 during a time duration @xmath9 and then stops interacting , the second quantum system @xmath11 then interacts with @xmath6 and so on .",
    "the continuous time limit , when @xmath9 goes to zero , has been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown that such discrete time models , under suitable renormalization , converge to the quantum langevin equations , that is , quantum stochastic differential equations .    in this article , we concentrate on the following particular situation .",
    "we consider that the system @xmath6 is composed of two quantum systems @xmath12 and @xmath13 which do not interact together .",
    "this `` uncoupled '' system undergoes quantum repeated interactions as follows . each piece @xmath8 of the environment",
    "interacts first with @xmath12 during a time duration @xmath9 without interacting with @xmath13 and then interacts with @xmath13 without interacting anymore with @xmath12 .",
    "for example , in the spirit of the experiments driven by haroche et al ( cf @xcite ) , the bipartite system can been thought of as two isolated cavities with a magnetic field trapping several photons in each cavities .",
    "a chain of two - level systems ( such as rydberg atoms in some particular state , as in the experiment ) are passing through the cavities , one after the other , creating this way an entanglement in between the photons of each cavities .",
    "our work is motivated by entanglement considerations . while the systems @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not initially entangled and while there is no direct interaction between them , our special scheme of quantum repeated interactions creates naturally entanglement .",
    "more precisely , we show that this scheme of interaction , in the continuous - time limit , is equivalent to a usual quantum repeated interaction model where , actually , @xmath12 interacts with @xmath13 . in other words , our special scheme of quantum repeated interactions creates spontaneously an effective interaction hamiltonian between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we explicitly compute the associated interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the bipartite repeated quantum interaction model is described in details . in section 3 ,",
    "we focus on the continuous - time limit , that is , when the time interaction between the systems @xmath8 and @xmath14 goes to zero .",
    "more precisely , we derive the quantum stochastic differential equation representing the limit evolution . this allows to identify the effective coupling hamiltonian .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of the evolution of the entanglement between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the physical example of the spontaneous emission of a photon . in section 5",
    ", we derive the lindblad generator of the limit evolution in the case of a thermal environment , represented by a gibbs state .",
    "we then study the property of return to equilibrium , that is , the asymptotic convergence for all initial state toward an invariant state .",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of the model .",
    "as announced , we consider a quantum system @xmath15 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not interact together .",
    "this means that the free evolution of @xmath6 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the free hamiltonian of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this system is coupled to an environment made of an infinite chain of identical and independent systems : @xmath19 where @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction between @xmath6 and the infinite chain is described by a model of quantum repeated interactions , that is , the copies of @xmath22 interact ones after the others with @xmath6 and then stop interacting .",
    "a single interaction between a copy of @xmath22 and @xmath15 is described by a particular mechanism , the interaction is divided into two parts : the system @xmath22 interacts first with @xmath12 during a time @xmath9 without interacting with @xmath2 , then the system @xmath22 interacts with @xmath13 during a time @xmath9 without interacting with @xmath1 .    in terms of hamiltonians ,",
    "the evolution of the coupled system @xmath23 can be described as follows .",
    "for the first interaction , we consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the free hamiltonian of @xmath22 , the operator @xmath26 represents the interaction hamiltonian between @xmath22 and @xmath12 ( this operator acts as the identity operator on @xmath2 ) and @xmath27 is a coupling constant . in a similar way , the second evolution is described by @xmath28 where this time @xmath29 acts non - trivially only on @xmath22 and @xmath2 and acts as the identity operator on @xmath1 .",
    "the terms @xmath30 represents also the coupling constant of the second interaction .",
    "each operator @xmath31 and @xmath32 gives rise to a unitary evolution @xmath33 since the space @xmath22 interacts first with @xmath1 and then @xmath2 , the composed evolution is then given by @xmath34    let us stress that usually the interaction between @xmath22 and @xmath6 should have been given by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 would have represented the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "this would have given rise to a usual unitary operator of the form @xmath37 in our model , since @xmath26 and @xmath29 do not commute , we can not directly put the unitary in the form of . in the following",
    ", we shall see ( in the continuous - time limit ) that our model with @xmath38 is equivalent to a standard model where actually there is an effective interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us make precise now the form of the interaction hamiltonians involved in and .",
    "we assume in this work that the hilbert spaces involved in the interaction , that is , @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are finite dimensional .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath22 is supposed here to be @xmath39 .",
    "we consider on @xmath39 an orthonormal basis made of eigenvectors of @xmath40 , denoted by @xmath41 , where the vector @xmath42 is understood as the ground state of @xmath22 .",
    "consider the associated canonical operators @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 for all @xmath45 and @xmath21 in @xmath46 . with this notation",
    ", we have @xmath47 where the @xmath48 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath40 .    for the interaction hamiltonians we shall consider operators of the form @xmath49 where the @xmath50 s are operators on @xmath12 and the @xmath51 s on @xmath13 .",
    "as usual in the schrdinger picture , the evolutions of states on @xmath23 are given by @xmath52 where we recall that @xmath53 takes the particular form @xmath38 in our context .",
    "now , we are in the position to describe the whole interaction between @xmath54 and the chain @xmath7 , with @xmath55 .",
    "the scheme is as follows .",
    "the first copy @xmath10 interacts with @xmath54 during a time @xmath56 while the rest of the chain remains isolated .",
    "then , the first copy disappears and the second copy comes to interact and so on ... before making precise the evolution , we need to introduce a notation for the operators acting only on @xmath57 and being the identity operator on the rest of the whole space .",
    "if @xmath58 is an operator on @xmath22 , we extend it as an operator on @xmath7 but acting non - trivially only on @xmath57 by putting @xmath59 mathematically , on @xmath60 , we consider the family of unitary operators @xmath61 , where @xmath62 acts as @xmath53 on @xmath63 and the @xmath64-th copy of @xmath65 and as the identity on the rest of the chain .",
    "the operator @xmath62 represents actually the interaction between @xmath54 and @xmath57 .",
    "more precisely , the operator @xmath62 is defined as @xmath66 , where for example @xmath67 with @xmath68 the corresponding similar description holds for @xmath69 .",
    "the whole evolution is finally described by the family of unitary operators @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 as a consequence , if the initial state of @xmath60 is @xmath72 , the state after @xmath64 interactions is @xmath73 now that the discrete - time evolution is clearly described , we shall now investigate the continuous - time limit of such evolutions in the next section .",
    "this section is devoted to derive the continuous time limit of our special scheme of repeated interactions , i.e. the limit when the time parameter @xmath9 goes to @xmath74 . in order to obtain a relevant limit ,",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown that the total hamiltonian has to be properly rescaled in terms of @xmath9 . in particular , it is crucial to strengthen the interaction in order to see its effect at the limit .",
    "more precisely , translated in our context , the total hamiltonians have to be of the following form : @xmath75 let us stress that in the above expressions the coupling constants appearing in and have been replaced by @xmath76 .",
    "we denote by @xmath77 the floor function .",
    "one can show that the operators @xmath78 defined in converge to a family of operators @xmath79 satisfying a particular quantum stochastic differential equation .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite , it is shown that we can embed the space @xmath80 into an appropriate fock space @xmath81 . in this context",
    "the discrete time interaction , described by @xmath78 , appears naturally as an approximation of a continuous one described by a family of unitary operators @xmath79 acting on @xmath81 ( i.e. @xmath78 converges to @xmath82 when @xmath9 goes to zero ) . in particular",

    "this element @xmath229 can be written with respect to the canonical basis @xmath230 as @xmath231 where the @xmath232 s are operators on @xmath39 . since the operators @xmath229 and @xmath225 commute for all @xmath233 , we get the equality between @xmath234 and @xmath235 from the commutation of @xmath229 and @xmath236 , we also have the equality between @xmath237 and @xmath238 from these equalities and since the operators @xmath230 form a basis , the following system of equations is obtained for @xmath239 , @xmath240 for @xmath241 with @xmath242 @xmath243 and @xmath244 and for @xmath245 with @xmath246 and @xmath247 @xmath248 we now study all these equations in order to prove that the @xmath232 s are all equal to @xmath74 .",
    "note that the commutation of a matrix @xmath249 with @xmath250 for @xmath251 implies that for all @xmath252 and @xmath253 with @xmath254 @xmath255 the commutation of @xmath256 with @xmath257 gives that for all @xmath252 and @xmath253 with @xmath254 @xmath258 thus since @xmath259 for all @xmath260 , the matrices @xmath261 are of the form @xmath262 by the same way , from @xmath263 for all @xmath260 , we deduce that the matrices @xmath264 are of the form @xmath265 consider now the equations on @xmath232 for @xmath266 .",
    "since we get @xmath267 and @xmath268 for @xmath269 with @xmath246 and @xmath247 , the matrix @xmath232 is a diagonal matrix whose coefficients are all equal to @xmath270 except the column @xmath271 and the row @xmath272 with for the moment only zero coefficients on the first row and the first column .    in the following ,",
    "the coefficients of a matrix @xmath232 are denoted by @xmath273 .",
    "we work then on the equation @xmath274 .",
    "this equality gives that the diagonal coefficients of @xmath261 are @xmath74 and for @xmath275 with @xmath276 , @xmath277 then from @xmath278 we deduce that the diagonal coefficients of @xmath279 are @xmath74 and , for @xmath275 with @xmath280 , @xmath281 from the equalities @xmath282 and @xmath283 with @xmath284 , we finally obtain that all the matrices @xmath264 , @xmath261 and @xmath285 are all equal to @xmath74 for @xmath286 .",
    "for @xmath287 , the equalities @xmath288 allow us to conclude that the only non zero operators are the @xmath289 s for @xmath290 and all equal to @xmath291 .",
