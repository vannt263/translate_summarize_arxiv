    "@xmath30 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 , @xmath55 and the initial data is such that @xmath83 then , the solution satisfies the maximum principle @xmath84    the fact that @xmath85 independently of the value of @xmath9 , allows for a global result relying on a condition related to @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , we are interested in results that deal with every possible value of the physical parameters present in the problem .",
    "in our opinion , there are two reasons , at least in the case @xmath23 , why the smallness condition may be seen as a rather mild restriction .",
    "the first one is that the size restriction affects a lower norm , merely @xmath52 , keeping the higher seminorms as large as desired .",

    "the last case , namely where @xmath22 , is harder because the leading term in the equation is the transport term . however , under certain conditions , we can prove the global existence of solutions . before we can state the relevant result , we need some notation .",

    "these domain restrictions are due to the better behavior of the fractional laplacian in a bounded domain .",
    "the size restrictions on data are again on a lower order norm ( lipschitz ) and with a rather explicit constant .",
    "finally we obtain the standard finite time blow up for certain initial data in some hlder seminorm :    [ teo5 ] fix a constant @xmath4 and consider @xmath23 , @xmath99 . then , there exist @xmath100 and @xmath101 such that the corresponding solution , @xmath102 , of equation has a finite time singularity in @xmath103 for @xmath104 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath105    the proof of this result is obtained by a virial - type argument .",
    "however , we remark that it can also be obtained by means of pointwise arguments ( see castro & crdoba @xcite for an application of these pointwise arguments to prove blow up ) .",
