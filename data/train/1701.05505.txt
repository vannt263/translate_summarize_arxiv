    "the notion of spin currents describing the motion of magnetic moments associated with the spins of the electrons in solids is of central importance in the field of spintronics where one tries to use the spin degree of freedom to store and process information .",
    "unfortunately , in systems lacking spin - rotational invariance ( which can be broken by an external magnetic field or by relativistic effects such as spin - orbit coupling or dipole - dipole interactions ) the proper definition of the quantum mechanical operator representing the spin current is ambiguous , because the magnetization does not satisfy a local conservation law . in the past decade",
    "several authors have proposed resolutions of this ambiguity @xcite , but a generally accepted agreement on the correct definition of the spin current operator in systems without spin conservation has not been found .    the purpose of this work is show that the distinction between translational and angular spin currents proposed by sun and xie @xcite leads to a simple and unique definition of the concept of spin transport in condensed matter systems .",

    "we will provide expressions for the translational spin current operator @xmath12 and the precession frequency @xmath13 valid for itinerant as well as localized systems .",
    "although the explicit construction of this decomposition is very simple , it entails profound physical consequences : since only the translational movement of magnetization corresponds to the physical displacement of magnetic moments , in equilibrium only stationary translational spin currents can generate an electrical field @xcite .",
    "angular spin currents on the other hand only transport the polarization , hence a stationary angular spin current is simply an inhomogeneous configuration of the local magnetic order and does not create an electrical field .",
    "furthermore , we also show that in generic magnetic insulators the classical magnetic order can not support translational spin transport at vanishing temperature ; incoherent thermal or quantum fluctuations are mandatory for the physical transport of magnetization in these systems .",

    "finally , let us also point out that although the classical ground state ( [ eq : groundstatering ] ) of the heisenberg ring is very similar to the classical ground state of the easy - plane ferromagnet discussed in the last section , it does not support spin superfluidity , i.e. , angular spin supercurrents , because the phase @xmath124 of the magnetization is pinned by the external magnetic field @xmath149 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : josephson ] ) with a mass supercurrent of superfluid bosons @xcite , does not correspond to the physical movement of _ magnetization _ , but of _ polarization_.",

    "this physical difference between the two types of spin transport persists also out of equilibrium : as already shown by sun and xie @xcite , an angular spin current with finite @xmath151 will generate an electrical field @xmath152 for large distance @xmath153 from the source , whereas the electrical field of translational spin currents decays as @xmath154 .",
    "we have also shown that spin superfluidity can be described entirely without referring to off - diagonal long - range order @xcite and magnon condensation .",
    "this is achieved by quantizing the spins in a self - consistently defined frame of reference with the local @xmath125-axis pointing in the direction @xmath155 of the instantaneous magnetization .",
    "magnons defined with respect to this reference frame can never condense or display off - diagonal long - range order , hence they are not superfluid .",
    "this is in agreement with the general proof of kohn and sherrington @xcite that bosonic quasi - particles which are formed as bound states of particle - hole pairs of the underlying fermionic system ( such as excitons or magnons ) do not exhibit off - diagonal long - range order in coordinate space .",

    "<S> in magnets with non - collinear spin configuration the expectation value of the conventionally defined spin current operator contains a contribution which renormalizes an external magnetic field and hence affects only the precessional motion of the spin polarization . </S>",

    "<S> we give a prescription how to separate these two types of spin transport and show that the translational movement of the spin is always polarized along the direction of the local magnetization . </S>",
