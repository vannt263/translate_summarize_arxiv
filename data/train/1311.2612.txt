    "since the inception of quantum mechanics our understanding of quantum systems is essentially based on two intertwined principles : uncertainty and complementarity .",
    "this landscape started changing in 2011 , with experiments showing that it is possible to reconstruct the photon wave function from direct measurements @xcite and to infer how photons travel ( on average ) in young s experiment @xcite .",
    "this apparent breach in the above principles is possible through the experimental implementation of the concept of weak measurement @xcite , which does not constitute a true violation of the quantum rules , but only looking at them with different eyes .",
    "strong ( von neumann ) measurements lead the measured system to irreversibly collapse onto one of the pointer states of the measuring device . on the contrary",
    ", weak measurements only produce a slight perturbation on the system , which may still continue as an almost unaltered evolution .",
    "consequently , the pointer of the measuring device only undergoes a slight deviation .",
    "this information , together with the one arising from a subsequent strong measurement , is enough to completely specify the state of the system .",
    "that is , the system quantum state can be determined from a single experiment just by measuring the probability density and its transversal flow ( accounted for by the current density ) , unlike other traditional methods , such as quantum state tomography @xcite , which require several complementary experiments in order to obtain a full picture of the corresponding quantum state . rigorously speaking , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote pre- and post - selected states of the system , respectively , the weak value rendered by a weak measurement associated with an operator @xmath2 is defined as a_w .",
    "[ eq0 ] given the dependence of the weak value @xmath3 on the system pre- and post - selected states , it can be cleverly enhanced by choosing these states in such a way that they approach the orthogonality .",
    "one of the targets of the weak - measurement technique has been the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , also known as bohmian mechanics , due to the impossible but appealing idea of dealing with well - defined trajectories in quantum mechanics .",
    "this quantum approach is a way to recast quantum mechanics in terms of a hydrodynamic language , equivalent to the formulations formerly proposed by schrdinger , heisenberg , dirac , feynman , wigner , etc . in bohmian mechanics @xcite the flow of the probability density in configuration space , which accounts for the system time - evolution ,",
    "is monitored by means of streamlines or trajectories . within this scenario",
    "weak values are directly connected to the bohmian momentum as @xcite = s = re , [ eq1 ] where @xmath4 is the phase of the system wave function when the latter is recast in polar form , ( * r*,t ) = ^1/2(*r*,t ) e^is(*r*,t)/ , [ pa ] with @xmath5 being the probability density .",
    "actually , the momentum @xmath6 can be rigorously placed within the standard schrdinger picture in coordinate representation as the quotient between the probability density current and the probability density ( see section  [ sec22 ] below ) .",
    "the expression between square brackets on the right - hand side thus corresponds to the weak value associated with a ( weak ) measurement of the usual momentum operator , @xmath7 , followed by a standard ( strong ) measurement of the position operator @xmath8 ( with outcome @xmath9 ) .",
    "the combination of the two measurements eventually provides the value of the local momentum @xmath6 at the position @xmath9 . in particular , the quantity measured in the experiment performed by kocsis _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite was the transversal component of this momentum .",
    "moved by the fact that bohmian trajectories are in compliance with the experimental data reported in @xcite , which provide an intuitive picture of the average dynamical evolution of a swarm of individual photons in young s experiment , it seems to be a very natural question to ask about the quantum dynamics associated with mixed states in an analogous situation . in this regard ,",
    "if the same experiment is repeated introducing some degree of incoherence , the collection of frames of the transverse momentum will give us an idea on how the corresponding mixed state evolves , even though we are aware that such a state only represents a kind of average information about the quantum system .",
    "leaving aside the question about what such a state really represents or if it really exists , our purpose here is just to investigate which kind of trajectories can be associated with it and , therefore , what could be expected from a real experiment , which in principle could be easily tested by means of the same experimental setup used in @xcite , although including some minor changes related to the way how the mixedness or incoherence is treated .",
    "specifically , to that end we have considered two simple numerical implementations of young s experiment , which represent two possible ways to reach the same mixed state . in one of these scenarios , one and only one",
    "slit is randomly open at a time , while in the other each time that the particle passes through the two slits , an extra random phase arises between the two diffracted waves . in both cases ,",
    "the final outcome is the same : interference fringes are removed .",
    "notice that in the first scenario one would expect the classical - like result of trajectories for two independently open slits , while in the second scenario trajectories evolve with the information that both slits are open .",
    "now , under such circumstances , how does the transverse momentum ( weak value ) looks like if we perform measurements at different positions from the slits as in @xcite ?",
    "what we have noticed is that the trajectories associated with sets of measurements render in the end results that display analogous properties to those of the pure case , namely that trajectories avoid crossing through the same point at the same time even if we do not observe any interference features . in this regard , notice that even if the density matrix only describes lack of knowledge on some experimental conditions ( which slit has been randomly open , or which random phase has been added ) , thus representing an epistemic state of the system , weak measurements can not discriminate how the experiment is performed , thus providing us with information on the whole setup ( both slits open at a time ) , just as if we had an ontic state .",
    "the work has been organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we explore the guidance equation for mixed states @xmath10 in a young - type interferometer , emphasizing its nonlinear nature by considering two different physical realizations of @xmath10 . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we propose a practical experiment revealing the nonclassical features of the guidance equation in the case of totally mixed @xmath10 leading to no interference effect .",
    "the main outcomes from this work as well as some related remarks are summarized in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "let us consider the passage of a particle , such as a photon or an electron , through the two slits of a young - type interferometer . for a better understanding of the approach described below ,",
    "it is illustrative briefly revisiting the basic physical ideas behind the original experiment . to that end , it is enough to start the description once particles ( in this case , photons ) have been diffracted by the two slits ; more details on how the experiment was exactly performed can be found in the original work @xcite .",
    "thus , essentially , once the distance between the slits and the detector is fixed ( by adjusting a set of lenses ) , the latter collects the flux of photons , one by one , for a certain exposure time and at different positions along the direction parallel to the slits ( the transversal direction ) .",
    "so far , this step is standard in experiments of this kind . in order to determine within the same experiment the average transverse momentum and , therefore ,",
    "get information about the photon average flow along the transversal direction , a polarizer that produces a slight variation of the photon polarization state ( weak measurement ) is introduced at a certain distance behind the two slits .",
    "notice in this procedure that the information obtained is statistical , because for each position of the detector it is needed a physically significant number of photons ( directly related to the detector exposure time ) . in this sense",
    ", at each distance from the slits , the intensity pattern is proportional to the number of photons that reach a given position in a certain ( exposure ) time and , more importantly , the associated transverse momentum corresponds to the average ( transverse ) momentum of those photons .",
    "therefore , the trajectories or paths inferred from the experimental data recorded only provide us with information on the average ( transverse ) flow associated with a large ensemble of independent photons , saying nothing about the individual motion of each photon , which remains unknown .",
    "this is the maximum amount of information that the experiment will render , thus avoiding the violation of any fundamental quantum principle .",
    "note that in the above experiment one can assume without loss of generality that the source is highly coherent , so that the wave function associated with the particle before reaching the slits is nearly monochromatic , i.e. , a plane wave , for practical purposes .",
    "this is rather common working hypothesis in matter wave interferometry as well as in its optical counterpart ( which is , nonetheless , based on experimental evidence , of course ) .",
    "now , let us consider exactly the same experimental setup , including the same statistical procedure .",
    "however , after the particle gets diffracted and before it reaches the polarizer , we assume that the two outgoing probability amplitudes ( one for each slit ) are acted in such a way that they no longer constitute a coherent superposition .",
    "this results in a mixed state described by a density matrix @xmath10 , which does not give rise to interference features if it is maximally mixed .",
    "there are two physical scenarios compatible with this @xmath10 , which are associated with two different ways to carry out the experiment :    * this state may arise from a situation where one and only one slit is randomly open at a time .",
    "for example , each slit can be followed by a shutter ; both shutters are somehow connected to and controlled by a relay , so that when one of the shutters is open the other is closed , and vice versa .",
    "the open / close procedure is automatic and random , and takes place before the photon has reached the slits . in this way , if we do not keep track on which shutter ( slit ) is open at each time , the mixed state describing the experiment is given by ( t ) = _ p _",
    "|_(t ) _ ( t ) | = p_+ |_+ ( t ) _ + ( t ) | + p_- |_- ( t ) _ - ( t ) | , [ f1 ] where @xmath11 denotes the probability amplitude coming from slit @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , with @xmath14 being positive real numbers such that @xmath15 ( for maximal mixedness @xmath16 ) . formally speaking , eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) appeals to a physical picture where each system realization is prepared either in state @xmath17 or @xmath18 , with probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively @xmath17 and @xmath18 never coexist and therefore we never see interference at a distant screen [ notice the lack of coherence terms @xmath21 in ( [ f1 ] ) ] . * alternatively , mixedness can also be produced by adding a random , uncorrelated constant phase @xmath22 between the two diffracted probability amplitudes . from an experimental viewpoint",
    ", this would correspond to a situation where one of the slits is followed , for example , by a polarizer such that its polarization axis may acquire a random orientation before the photon reaches the two slits . in this case , the discrete sum of ( [ f1 ] ) becomes an integral in order to account for the continuous phase value , between 0 and @xmath23 , and consequently @xmath10 reads as ( t ) = _ 2 d p ( ) |_(t ) _ ( t )    @xmath24 is the statistics for @xmath22 , with @xmath25 for maximal mixedness . as",
    "before , because the different values of @xmath22 are unknown , at each distance from the slit the probability density is just an average over all the realizations . hence , although for each particular value of @xmath22 there is always interference at a distant screen , with visibility @xmath26 , the eventual interference fringes are washed out due to the @xmath22-averaging .    in principle , regardless of the interpretation that can be ascribed to @xmath10 , experiments such as the above described ones would allow to monitor the time - evolution of the corresponding ( averaged ) probability density by determining it at different distances from the slits , just as in the experiment reported in @xcite .",
    "these experiments would not be able to discriminate between the two scenarios , thus rendering the same average quantities , a signature that mixedness can be reached in many physically different but formally equivalent ways [ of course , unless one keeps records of which shutter is open at each time , but then we would have separately @xmath27 , instead of ( [ f1 ] ) ] .",
    "furthermore , it is also worth stressing that in these experiments coherence times do not play any role in principle , unlike experiments involving loss of coherence by decoherence , for instance . in the above experiments it is assumed that the passage of particles ( e.g. , photons , as in @xcite ) is performed in such a way that there is one and only one particle crossing the interferometer at each time . in this regard",
    ", the suggested experiments would be close in spirit to the one recently carried out by matteucci _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite consisting in reproducing young s interference pattern with electrons launched in such a way that there is no possibility that these particles can be time - correlated .",
    "this means that the only relevant time - scales would be the time span between two consecutive events and the time needed to ( randomly ) change the state of the shutter or the polarizer .",
    "now , since both experiments can be in principle performed leaving a long delay between consecutive experiments and launching each individual particle at will ( providing we do not look at the state of shutters / polarizers ) , the relevance of these time - scales is also relative .",
    "the weak value associated with the momentum operator ( to be more precise , its transverse component ) corresponds to the bohmian momentum or guidance equation , which is well defined for pure states . to obtain a generalized version ,",
    "also valid for mixed states , let us start from the von neumann equation , = - , [ vn1 ] which describes , in general , the time - evolution of the density matrix @xmath10 . in the position representation , the elements of the density matrix read as @xmath28 ;",
    "the probability density @xmath29 comes from the diagonal of @xmath30 ( i.e. , for @xmath31 ) .",
    "the time - evolution of the probability density associated with a mixed state can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vn1 ] ) by projecting both sides of this equation onto the position space .",
    "this results in = -   | |*r*. [ vn2 ] after some algebra , and taking into account that @xmath32 , we find the continuity equation = - ( * r*,t ) , [ vn3 ] where =   _ * r * = * r * [ j1 ] is the current density associated with @xmath29 .",
    "nonetheless , in general , regardless of the chosen representation , the current density can be expressed as @xcite ( * r*,t ) = , [ pdc ] where ( * r * ) = ( | * r * | + | * r * | ) is the current density operator . in analogy to transport phenomena satisfying a conservation law like eq .",
    "( [ vn2 ] ) , and taking into account the functional form ( [ pdc ] ) , we can assume that @xmath33 represents an advective flux associated with a velocity field _",
    "( * r*,t ) = , [ ge0 ] with the subscript @xmath10 denoting the fact that the trajectory is obtained with the information supplied by this density matrix ( for pure states we shall simply use @xmath34 ) .",

    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) reduces to the usual bohmian guidance equation _ ( * r*,t ) =   s ( * r*,t ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the mixed state is represented as = _ p_| _",

    "the same discussion holds for the continuous case with @xmath22 , but substituting the sum by an integral , as pointed out in section  [ sec21 ] . in any case , to some extent eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) would agree with an ontic understanding of the process , while eq .",

    "however , if we also focus on the dynamical behavior of the density matrix , i.e. , its flow in configuration space , things become different .",
