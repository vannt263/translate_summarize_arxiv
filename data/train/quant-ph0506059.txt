    "multipartite entanglement is an essential ingredient for complex quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks , such as quantum error - correction @xcite , multi - party quantum communication @xcite and universal quantum computation in the one - way model @xcite .",
    "it has been generated between photons @xcite and in a controlled way both in ion traps @xcite and in experiments with mott insulating states of neutral bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "for photon and ion trap experiments full state tomography @xcite impressively proved the existence of multipartite entanglement with few particles .",
    "however , its unambiguous detection in optical lattice setups has so far not been possible .",
    "the measurements implemented in the actual experiments only provided information on the average density operator of each individual atom ( representing a qubit ) , but not on the density operator of the composite system @xcite .",
    "full state tomography in optical lattices seems to be infeasible due to the large number of involved atoms and thus other methods are required to prove the existence of entanglement .",
    "recently , a quantum network that can detect multipartite entanglement in bosons , and can be realized in optical lattices , was proposed @xcite .",
    "this quantum network is made up of pairwise beam - splitters ( bs ) acting on two identical copies of a multipartite entangled state @xmath0 of @xmath1 atoms , and allows the determination of the purity of @xmath0 and of all its reduced subsystems .",
    "the purities provide us with a separability criterion based on entropic inequalities @xcite that , if violated , indicate that the state @xmath0 is entangled .",
    "this nonlinear entanglement test can be implemented experimentally with a number of copies of @xmath0 independent of @xmath1 , rather than the exponentially large number of copies needed for a full state tomography , and is more powerful than the other common experimental methods , such as bell inequalities @xcite and entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nonlinear inequalities are known to be strictly stronger than the bell - chsh inequalities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if it may be assumed that the entangled state is characterized by a few parameters only it is often possible to determine them from the results obtained from the entanglement detection network .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to analyze the operation of the entanglement detection network under realistic experimental conditions . after introducing the ideal scheme we consider the particular realization of the network in an optical lattice .",
    "we discuss three main sources of imperfections : limited or no spatial resolution , errors in the bs operations occurring with a probability @xmath2 , and failure to detect an atom with probability @xmath3 . in current experiments",
    "none of these errors can be suppressed completely and thus it is important to find out whether their presence still allows the unambiguous detection and characterization of multipartite entangled states .",
    "our main results will be that ( i ) even without spatial resolution it is possible to unambiguously detect and characterize entanglement in multipartite states like cluster states and macroscopic superposition states , ( ii ) the effects of bs and detection errors can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of runs of the entanglement detection network , and ( iii ) the required number of experimental runs for achieving this is reasonably small if @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of particles in the subsystem whose reduced purity is being measured .",
    "finally we will find that ( iv ) single site resolution is necessary to achieve significant improvement compared to having no spatial resolution at all .",

    "in this section we first present the entropic inequalities which are used to detect multipartite entanglement .",

    "then we introduce our entanglement detection network and discuss its implementation in optical lattices .",
    "finally we study the main types of imperfections and resulting errors that we expect to be present in this experimental realization .",

    "furthermore our test is insensitive to local unitary operations , which can not alter the entanglement structure , since they do not change the purities .",

    "this method thus yields one measurement @xmath68 relating to entanglement and two measurements relating to local unitaries .",

    "the detection of the remaining singly - occupied sites is achieved by measuring the atomic density profile after the atoms are released from the lattice .",

    "hence , in order to empty doubly - occupied sites in all three states we can either turn on consecutively three separate feshbach resonances or change the internal state of the pairs of atoms during the loss process using an appropriate sequence of laser pulses .",
    "even if three resonances are experimentally accessible the latter might yield better results as the resonance with the best ratio of two - atom to single - atom loss can be exploited .",
