    "the impact of close - out conventions in the isda setting has been highlighted in @xcite , @xcite with particular regard to the consequences on bilateral counterparty risk adjustments .",
    "the authors show how the contractual definition of the close out amount ( `` risk - free '' vs `` substitution '' ) in case of default has a strong impact on the fair price of the transaction at inception ; moreover , the isda close - out amount protocol extends such conventions to any additional early termination event ( ate ) , see 6(e)(ii)(1 ) and pag 17 ( par 5 ) in @xcite . a wide debate @xcite , @xcite has taken place on the implication of the close - out definition and has focused in particular on the rating - triggered ates @xcite .    here",
    ", we focus instead on how to value a single uncollateralized transaction where a party has the option to early terminate the transaction at predefined dates by exchanging the default risk - free amount with the other party .",
    "this kind of ate is commonly introduced to shorten the horizon of the credit line between the parties ; in the following we will refer to it as a _ break clause _ ( bc ) .",
    "this case is different , and to a certain extent simpler , from those examined in previous literature , where the exercise date of the early termination is a priori unknown .",
    "we will obtain a general but remarkably simple pricing formula for the case of default - free close out amount , a choice particularly interesting , as it is the only counterparty - independent one , and therefore a good candidate to a less arbitrary close - out convention @xcite , even if it is subject to criticism @xcite when used to determine the settlement amount in case of default of the counterparty .",
    "it is clear that a bermudan - like optionality is in general related to a bc , and that the strike of the option is defined by the close - out amount .",
    "our main result shows how the choice of a default risk - free close - out amount implies a remarkably simple form for the payoff of such an option . on the other hand ,",
    "the optionality is worthless only if we assume the close - out amount to be equal to the current value of the transaction , a quite improbable scenario - at least under the isda protocol when the close - out amount is determined on the basis of the quotations of third parties whose creditworthiness may be far from that of the original counterparty . moreover , when the termination event is triggered by a bc , we remark that the choice of a default risk - free amount naturally arises from the isda protocol .",
    "in fact , on one hand , if the parties have specified that mid - market quotations should be used to determine the termination payment , the default risk of the exercising party does not have to be considered in the quotation ( pag 17 , par 5 in @xcite ) ; on the other hand , a rational choice for the exercising party that minimizes the cva that negatively affects the calculation of the termination amount , is to collect quotations from counterparties with high credit standing or no default risk ( e.g. clearing members of a central counterparty ) .",
    "first , we will apply the pricing formula to show how it works in the simple case of an equity forward with a unique bc . in this case",
    "quasi - analytical results are available , at least assuming deterministic intensities for the default processes , using the well known geske - johnson approach for bermudan derivatives ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which is an effective technique when the exercise dates are few ( as is often the case , e.g.  for medium dated swaps , i.e.  with maturity between 7 and 10 years ) .",
    "we will then address a more general case by using the pricing formula on a trinomial tree to evaluate a receiver / payer interest swap with multiple bcs . in all cases",
    "we find considerable impacts on the par strike .",
    "finally , we will briefly discuss how a bc may be effective in mitigating the counterparty risk related to a transaction , at least from a basel iii perspective , to the extent that it reduces the variability of the expected loss ( the so - called unilateral credit valuation adjustment - ucva ) due to the deterioration of the credit worthiness of the counterparty .",
    "furthermore , a mutual bc is even more effective to mitigate the unilateral cva risk , since it cancels the contribution to the unilateral cva after the first exercise date .",
    "these results give a strong quantitative support to the capital relief discussion in @xcite .    even if our approach is at a transaction level and can not easily include the netting effects with other transactions referenced to the same isda agreement , we point out that our work has practical implications , due to the wide presence in the market of uncollateralized swap referenced to a single - transaction agreement , or of portfolios composed by a few large transactions with the same side ( e.g.  a portfolio of payer interest rate swaps ) . for instance , consider the case of a derivative between a bank and a corporate , between a bank and a sovereign ( see @xcite for a notable example ) , and of a so - called back - swap linked to securitization or covered bond .",
    "these cases often concern long - dated swaps and typically involve bcs .",
    "in the following we refer to the notation and the results of @xcite . the value @xmath0 of a derivative contract between two defaultable counterparty @xmath1 and @xmath2 as seen from @xmath2 in @xmath3 , when the first to default effect is taken into account , is @xmath4^+ \\right| t_0 \\right\\ } + \\mathbb{e}\\left\\{\\left .",

    "equation ( [ ubc ] ) has essentially the following meaning : the party that is long the bc continues the transaction at @xmath24 only if its expected gain ( bdva ) exceeds its expected loss ( bcva ) or , equivalently , if the value of the transaction ( including the bilateral valuation adjustment ) is worth more than the default risk - free value . by reducing the impact of the bilateral valuation adjustment",
    ", a bc brings the value of the transaction near its default risk - free value .",
    "in particular , it reduces the expected loss of the transaction , due to a number of scenarios in which the bc is exercised and any loss due to the default of the counterparty may arise just until @xmath24 instead of the maturity date .",

    "as in @xcite , we assume that the default times have a bivariate exponential distribution obtained combining exponential marginal distributions with constant default intensity @xmath39 with a gumbel copula , disallowing simultaneous defaults .",

    "this particular choice of copula is common in the recent literature , and has the advantage of being analytically tractable .",
    "however , the results in terms of relevance of the unilateral bc in the pricing of derivatives have been found to be qualitatively identical to those obtained with a gaussian copula .",

    "one can see that the evaluation of the bc is strictly related to the pricing of bermudan options . among the various techniques that can be used to solve this kind of options we will first use the geske - johnson technique , that is well suited only for a small number of exercise dates , and with some additional approximations",
    "leads to analytical results in the case of an equity forward . to generalize our results , we will then evaluate the bc on a interest rate swap ( irs ) using a short rate model on a trinomial tree , a powerful technique that is widely used in the industry .",
    "we apply the pricing formula ( [ ubc ] ) to the case of an equity forward on a non dividend paying stock @xmath48 following black and scholes dynamics , with strike @xmath49 , maturity @xmath8 and unilateral bc at a single date @xmath23 .    to simplify the subsequent formulas let us assume that default can happen up to @xmath50 or @xmath51 , and in case of default the parties exchange the close - out amount as evaluated at @xmath24 or @xmath8 respectively rather than at the time of default .",
    "for a payer without bc , the pricing formula ( [ fairvalue1 ] ) together with eqs ( [ calls ] ) and ( [ puts ] ) becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) stands for the value in @xmath55 of a european call ( put ) option with maturity @xmath56 on the contingent claim @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "we point out that the inclusion of the terms bcva and bdva changes the par strike , except when the two counterparies are identical ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",

    "we will report the results also for the receiver forward , that are almost perfectly antithetic to those of the payer forward ( this effect is enhanced by the choice of zero interest rate and dividend yield , and of equal loss given default ) .",
