    "the forthcoming totem experiment at lhc will provide us , in fact , with the first measurements of soft pomeron ( strictly speaking pomeron and odderon ) as the contributions of secondary reggeons are negligible at such high energies .",
    "then obviously the precise measurement of @xmath1 differential cross section makes it possible to discriminate the various pomeron models comparing their particular predictions .",
    "certainly , such an analysis makes sense only if the same data set is used with the model parameters reliably fixed . for the time being there are three model types for elastic hadron scattering amplitudes which reproduce rising cross sections experimentally measured with a high precision .    * models treating pomeron ( and odderon as well ) as a simple pole in a complex momentum plane located righter of unity , @xmath7 @xcite . in order to describe a dip - bump structure in differential cross section",
    "one should take into account the cuts in one or another form .",
    "such a pomeron violates unitarity bound @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "however , the argument that unitarity corrections are important only at higher energies justifies this approach . *",
    "pomeron with @xmath10 is an input in some scheme of unitarization ( for example , eikonal or quasieikonal @xcite , @xmath11-matrix models @xcite ) .",
    "having done the unitarization all such models give @xmath12 , whereas other characteristic predictions depend on the concrete model . *",
    "another way to construct amplitude is just to take into account unitarity and analytical requirements from the beginning as well as experimental information on the cross sections ( e.g. growth of total cross sections ) .",
    "such a model we named in what follows as model of unitarized pomeron . here",
    "most successful examples are tripole pomeron ( @xmath13 ) @xcite and dipole pomeron ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .    within the third approach",
    "we consider the models of tripole and dipole pomeron .",
    "these models are most successful in a description of all data on the forward scattering data @xcite .",
    "as it was shown @xcite the total cross sections of meson and nucleon interactions are described with the minimal @xmath15 in the dipole and tripole models in which forward scattering amplitudes are parameterized in explicit analytic form .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by analysis applying the dispersion relations for real part of amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the elastic scattering at small-@xmath16 ( @xmath17 gev@xmath5 ) ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) was analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "the particular model was considered as a combination of hard ( with @xmath20 ) and soft @xmath21 pomeron contributions .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that additional hard pomeron essentially improves the description of the meson and nucleon data on parameter @xmath22 comparing with ordinary soft pomeron model .",
    "extension of the model to higher @xmath16 can be done within some scheme of unitarization ( e.g. eikonal , quasieikonal , @xmath23 ) taking into account pomeron rescatterings or cuts .    here",
    "we focus on the dipole and tripole pomeron models . without entering the details",
    "we note here these models describe the small-@xmath16 differential cross sections with the same level of precision ( @xmath24 , dof@xmath25 degrees of freedom ) as the model of @xcite did .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the description of the data on elastic @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering at low and middle @xmath26 in the dipole and tripole pomeron models .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen.con ] we remind the general restrictions on hardness of pomeron singularity and form of its trajectory at small @xmath26 , imposed by unitarity bounds on cross sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dpar ] and in sec .",
    "[ sec : tpar ] parametrizations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 elastic scattering amplitudes are presented dealing with dipole and tripole pomeron models , correspondingly .",
    "results of least square analysis for both models as well as their comparison are given in the sec .",
    "[ sec : expdata ] .",
    "let us reiterate here that the model with @xmath27 is not compatible with a linear pomeron trajectory having the intercept 1 . indeed , let us assume that @xmath28 and the partial wave amplitude develops the form @xmath29^{n}}\\approx \\frac{i\\beta(1,t)}{\\left [ j-1-\\alpha_{p}'t\\right]^{n}},\\ ] ] @xmath30    in ( @xmath31)-representation amplitude @xmath32 is transformed to @xmath33 then , we have pomeron contribution at large @xmath34 as @xmath35^{n-1}(-is / s_{0})^{\\alpha'_{p}t}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 if as usually @xmath37 then we obtain @xmath38 according to the obvious inequality , @xmath39 we have @xmath40    thus we come to the conclusion that a model with @xmath27 is incompatible with a linear pomeron trajectory . in other words the partial amplitude eq . (",
    "[ eq : j - gen ] ) with @xmath41 ( but used in some papers ) in principle is incorrect .",
    "if @xmath42 we have a simple @xmath43-pole leading to constant total cross section and vanishing elastic cross section",
    ". however such a behaviour of the cross sections is not supported by experimental data .    if @xmath44 we have the model of dipole pomeron ( @xmath45 ) and would like to emphasize that double @xmath43-pole is the maximal singularity of partial amplitude settled by unitarity bound ( [ eq : unitbound ] ) if its trajectory is linear at @xmath46 .",
    "thus , constructing the model leading to cross section which increases faster than @xmath47 , we need to consider a more complicated case : @xmath48^{n}}\\approx \\frac{i\\beta(1,t)}{\\left [ j-1+k(-t)^{1/\\mu}\\right]^{n}}.\\ ] ] making use of the same arguments as above , we obtain @xmath49 @xmath50 however in this case amplitude @xmath51 has a branch point at @xmath0 which is forbidden by analyticity",
    ".    a proper form of amplitude leading to @xmath52 can be defined by behaviour of elastic scattering amplitude at @xmath53 . if @xmath54 then @xmath55 . ]",
    "decreasing faster than @xmath56 ( it is necessary for @xmath57 rising faster than @xmath58 ) is the following @xmath59^{n}}.\\ ] ] now we have @xmath60 branch points colliding at @xmath0 in @xmath43-plane and creating the pole of order @xmath61 at @xmath62 ( but there is no branch point in @xmath26 at @xmath0 ) .",
    "at the same time @xmath63 and from the @xmath64 one can obtain @xmath65 if @xmath66 then @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath68 then @xmath69 and @xmath44 what corresponds just to the dipole pomeron model . in the tripole pomeron model @xmath70 and @xmath71 what means @xmath72 .",
    "the dominating term at high energy in this model is double pole @xmath73 apparently in accordance with the inequalities ( [ eq : mnbound ] ) the double pole obeys the unitarity limit for linear pomeron trajectory ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "adding to the partial amplitude less singular term ( simple pole with a trajectory having intercept @xmath74 and a different slope @xmath75 ) we obtain dipole pomeron model in the form @xmath76 it can be rewritten in @xmath77 representation as@xmath78 where variable @xmath79 is proportional to cosine of scattering angle in @xmath26-channel @xmath80 generally , the form factors ( or residues ) @xmath81 may be chosen in various forms ( e.g. exponential , factorized powers _ etc . _ ) .",
    "however we consider the simplest exponential ones .",
    "let us consider two effective reggeons : crossing - even , @xmath82 , and crossing - odd , @xmath83 ) instead of four contributions - @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( the latter two reggeons are of less importance at high energy ) .",
    "we take into account their contribution in the standard form . however , we insert additional factor @xmath86 that changes a sign at some @xmath26 . and @xmath87 differential cross sections at @xmath88 gev@xmath5 .",
    "our analysis @xcite has shown that similar factor is visible in crossing - even reggeon term . ]",
    "@xmath89 where @xmath90 for @xmath91-reggeon and @xmath92 for @xmath93-reggeon .",
    "obviously these terms are very close to @xmath94- and @xmath95-reggeons , respectively .",
    "there are some arguments @xcite to use the factors @xmath86 in the form : @xmath96 going to extend wide regions of @xmath34 ( @xmath3 gev ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath97 gev@xmath5 ) . ]",
    "we certainly need a few extra terms in amplitude to reach a good fit to the data .",
    "first of all it concerns the odderon contribution .",
    "the existing data on total cross section and parameters @xmath98 , as well known , do not show any visible odderon contribution .",
    "however , it appears definitely to provide the difference of @xmath1 and @xmath2 differential cross sections at @xmath99 gev and @xmath26 around the dip .",
    "so , we add the odderon contribution vanishing at @xmath0 @xmath100 the term @xmath101 in eq .",
    "[ eq : odd_d ] does not violate unitarity restriction @xmath102 at very large @xmath34 due to presence of factor @xmath103 ( in the dipole model @xmath104 , therefore @xmath105 ) .    at high energy and at @xmath0 two main rescattering terms of dipole pomeron ( or cut terms )",
    "have the same form as the input amplitude - double pole plus simple pole .",
    "it means that comparing the model with experimental data we are not able to distinguish unambiguously input terms and cuts .",
    "then as result , at @xmath0 one may use the input amplitude only . at @xmath106",
    "the situation occurs more complicated because the slopes of trajectories in the cut terms are different from the input one .",
    "these terms are important at large @xmath16 but , in fact , they are already taken into account at @xmath0 .    keeping in mind the above arguments and preserving a good description of the data at @xmath0 we take pomeron , pomeron - pomeron and pomeron - reggeons cuts vanishing at @xmath0 .",
    "certainly they are not `` genuine '' rescatterings but mimic them quite efficiently at @xmath106 .",
    "thus we write down :    the pomeron contribution @xmath107,\\ ] ] the pomeron - pomeron cut @xmath108 the pomeron - even reggeon cut @xmath109 where @xmath110 and the pomeron - odd reggeon cut @xmath111 @xmath112",
    "as it follows from eq.([eq : mnbound ] ) for the dominating contribution in a tripole pomeron model with @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath44 , @xmath114 , we should take @xmath115^{3/2}}.\\ ] ] it seems to be natural to write the subleading terms as the following @xmath116},\\ ] ] @xmath117^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] then the amplitude has a form @xmath118 where @xmath119 means the contribution of other reggeons and possible cuts ( which are important at low energies ) .    taking into account that @xmath120 where @xmath121 one can find @xmath122 @xmath123 and @xmath124 thus tripole amplitude with the subleading terms can be presented as @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath79 is defined by exp.([eq : zvar ] ) , and @xmath127 , @xmath128 gev@xmath5 , @xmath129 is a constant .",
    "similar expression for odderon contribution ( but introducing the factors @xmath26 and @xmath130 ) is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "again , similarly to the dipole model we add the `` soft '' pomeron @xmath134 the reggeon and cut contributions which are of the same form as in dipole pomeron model eqs.([eq : pcut],[eq : p+cut],[eq : p - cut ] ) .    * agln - model . *",
    "let us give a few comments about another version of tripole pomeron model presented in the papers @xcite .",
    "\\1 . if @xmath135 , then the first pomeron term in @xcite is identical to the term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trpole - st ] ) while for the second and third terms authors use @xmath136 and @xmath137\\ ] ] which originated from the partial amplitudes @xmath138^{3/2}},\\ ] ] and @xmath139^{3/2}},\\ ] ] respectively",
    "they used another form of odderon terms .",
    "the maximal odderon contribution in the form @xmath140 as well as a simple pole odderon and odderon - pomeron cut are also taken into account .",
    "\\3 . omitting the details",
    "we note that because of the chosen form of signature factors the agln amplitude has pole in physical region at @xmath141 gev@xmath5 .",
    "this feature of the model restricts its applicability region .",
    "agln amplitude has similar poles even at lower values of @xmath16 in the reggeon terms .",
    "thus the model requires a modification to describe wider region of @xmath26 than was considered in @xcite , namely @xmath142 gev@xmath5 .",
    "clearly this model leads to the unreasonable intercept value for the crossing - odd reggeon , @xmath143 .",
    "it is in strong contradiction with the values known from meson resonance spectroscopy data .",
    "one could expect it close to the intercept of @xmath95-trajectory , @xmath144 @xcite .    nevertheless , in the section [ sec",
    ": expdata ] we demonstrate the curves for differential cross sections obtained in agln model in comparison with the results of our dipole and tripole models at energies available and future lhc .",
    "analyzing the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data we keep in mind a further extension of the models to elastic @xmath145 and @xmath146 scattering , which are quite precisely measured .",
    "one important point should be underlined from the beginning .",
    "fitting the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data on @xmath57 and @xmath147 gives the set of parameters which is essentially different from those derived from the fit of all ( @xmath148- and @xmath149-meson ) the data .",
    "following this procedure at the first stage we determine all parameters which control the amplitudes at @xmath0 .",
    "we use the standard data set for the @xmath145 and @xmath146 total cross sections and the ratios @xmath147 ( at 5 gev@xmath1502000 gev ) @xcite to find intercepts of @xmath151-reggeons and couplings of the reggeon and pomeron exchanges .",
    "there are 542 experimental points in the region under consideration ( see table [ tab : t0 - 1 ] ) .",
    "an extension of the @xmath152 and @xmath153 dipole and tripole amplitudes to @xmath145 and @xmath154 elastic scattering is quite straight forward .",
    "all the couplings are various in these amplitudes at @xmath0 but the odderon does not contribute to the @xmath155 and @xmath156 amplitudes . in the simplest unitarization schemes",
    "( eikonal , @xmath11-matrix ) all total cross sections at asymptotically high energies have the universal behaviour , @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is independent of the initial particles",
    ". today the data available support this conclusion and advocates putting the same couplings @xmath159 for the leading pomeron terms in all amplitudes .",
    "besides , in order to avoid uncertainty at @xmath0 ( constant contributions to total cross sections come additively from the third term of eq.([eq : trpole - st ] ) and from `` soft '' pomeron , eq.([eq : softpom ] ) ) we substitute couplings @xmath160 for @xmath161 in eq.([eq : trpole - st ] ) . as a result",
    "we have energy independent contribution to the total cross from @xmath160 only .",
    "the following normalization of @xmath162 amplitude is used @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 is the momentum of hadron @xmath166 in laboratory system of @xmath167 .",
    "the details of the fit at @xmath0 are presented in the tables [ tab : t0 - 1 ] and [ tab : t0 - 2 ] .",
    ".quality of the fit to @xmath57 and @xmath147 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we compare three unitarized models of elastic scattering amplitude fitting the dipole and tripole models to all existing data . we emphasize that the amplitude leading to the behaviour of @xmath168 should be parameterized with a special care of the unitarity and analyticity restrictions on properties of the leading partial wave singularity .",
    "the figures and tables demonstrate good description of the data within the considered models .",
    "however the obtained @xmath15 ( table [ tab : chi2-t ] ) hints that the dipole pomeron model looks more preferable .",
    "we believe the most interesting and instructive result for further search of more realistic model is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lhc ] .",
    "our predictions of the compared models ( together with agln model ) for @xmath1 cross section at lhc energy are crucially different at @xmath16 around 0.3 - 0.5 gev@xmath5 .",
