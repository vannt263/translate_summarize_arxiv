    "the motion of a particle in a viscous fluid causes a flow field to be created , that is , fluid mass is displaced in a very specific manner around the particle .",
    "the nature of this field depends sensitively on the geometry , boundary conditions and dimensionality of the system in question .",
    "for instance , flow fields in 3d decay as @xmath6 in an unbounded fluid , where @xmath3 is the distance from the localized perturbation . on the other hand , in a 2d fluid such as a thin film , flow fields decay logarithmically with distance @xcite .",
    "one example of a 2d system exhibiting such long - range behavior under certain specific circumstances is that of soap films @xcite .",
    "a soap film in its simplest form consists of a thin fluid layer of thickness @xmath1 buffered from air phases above and below it by surfactant layers .",
    "the fluid layer has a 3d viscosity @xmath7 , and the surfactant layers a 2d _ surface _ viscosity @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , because of the finite thickness of the fluid layer , and the 2d nature of the surfactant layers , it is unclear whether a soap film should be regarded as a 2d or 3d fluid for arbitrary film thickness , bulk viscosity and surface viscosity .",
    "two particle microrheology @xcite provides a powerful technique to determine the flow fields in soap films .",
    "this technique has been used with great success to characterize the rheological and flow properties of 3d systems such as biomaterials @xcite , polymer solutions @xcite and biological cells @xcite . to a lesser extent",
    ", it has also been used to determine the surface rheological properties of 2d fluids such as protein monolayers at an air water interface @xcite .",
    "briefly , this technique looks at the correlated motions of particles in the system of interest .",
    "when a particle undergoes motion in the system , either by thermal excitation @xcite or by an external perturbation @xcite , it creates a flow field in the surrounding medium .",
    "this flow field affects the motion of other particles in its vicinity .",
    "therefore , by measuring the correlated motions of pairs of particles as a function of their separation @xmath3 , the flow field in the system can be determined .    in this manuscript ,",
    "we look at the flow fields in soap films of different thickness @xmath1 and bulk viscosity @xmath7 , while keeping the surface viscosity @xmath8 constant . we embed probe particles of size @xmath2 in these soap films , and are able to vary the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 by over an order of magnitude , from @xmath9 @xcite . in order to account for the effects of the surfactant - laden interfaces and the thin fluid layer",
    ", we use the trapeznikov approximation @xcite that models the soap film as an effective interface with an effective surface viscosity @xmath10 .",
    "the flow fields in these films are then mapped as a function of @xmath3 , and compared to theoretical models of soap film flow .",
    "excellent agreement is obtained between the theoretical models and the flow fields in _ all _ soap films , irrespective of the parameter @xmath0 , using @xmath11 .",
    "however , we find that single - particle motion is faster than expected for thicker films with @xmath5 .",
    "this leads us to state that the hydrodynamics of the soap films transition from 2d to 3d - like behavior at this particular value of @xmath0 .",

    "fluorescent polystyrene spheres ( molecular probes , carboxylate modified , @xmath14 , 500 nm ) are added to the soap solutions .",
    "the soap films are created by dipping a circular stainless steel frame of diameter 1 mm into the solutions and drawing it out gently .",
    "the frame is then enclosed in a chamber designed to maintain relative humidity and minimize convective drift .",
    "the particles are then imaged with fluorescence microscopy to determine their motion in real space and real time .",
    "the tracer particles are imaged in a fluorescent microscope at a frame rate of 30 hz , with a 20@xmath15 objective ( numerical aperture = 0.4 , resolution = 465 nm / pixel ) used for large particles ( @xmath16 nm ) , and a 40@xmath15 objective ( numerical aperture = 0.55 , resolution = 233 nm / pixel ) for smaller ( @xmath14 nm ) particles . for each sample ,",
    "short movies of duration @xmath17 s are recorded with a ccd camera that has a 640 @xmath15 486 pixel resolution , with hundreds of particles lying within the field of view .",
    "the movies are later analyzed by particle tracking to obtain the positions of the tracers @xcite . from the particle positions , we determine their vector displacements by the relation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the absolute time and @xmath20 is the lag time .",
    "any global motion is subtracted from these vector displacements to minimize the effects of convective drift caused by the air phases that contact the soap film .",
    "these vector displacements are then used to determine the mean square displacement ( msd ) , @xmath21 , where the average is performed over all particles and all times @xmath19 .",

    "this has the added advantage that convective drift of the tracers is also substantially reduced beyond 500 s , resulting in more accurate measurements of particle motions .",
    "a soap film is considered `` thin '' when the thickness @xmath1 of the film is comparable to the particle size @xmath2 .",

    "the disagreement between @xmath114 and @xmath120 shows the breakdown of the applicability of saffman s equation to extract a useful surface viscosity from one - particle data , for situations with @xmath129 , and in fact coincides with a breakdown of the equality @xmath130 @xcite .    to summarize , for all films we have @xmath131 and for thin films we additionally have @xmath132 .",
    "the approximation @xmath133 is mathematically obvious for thick films , given the definitions of these two surface viscosities .",
    "it is worth noting that our prior work suggests that it is necessary to measure @xmath120 ( in thin films ) to be able to determine @xmath11 , as the viscosity of the surfactant layers @xmath8 is usually not known ahead of time @xcite ; this current work suggests that measuring @xmath123 is an additional method to obtain @xmath11 and thus @xmath8 .    using these insights , we return to the data shown in fig .

    "fig : fitparams ] . for low values of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath94 is constant , as shown in panel ( a ) ; meanwhile , @xmath93 drops , as shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "this suggests that the mobility @xmath53 scales as @xmath134 for thin films .",
    "indeed , this explains the correlations of @xmath93 and @xmath105 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitparams](c ) for thin films , as @xmath135 would be expected @xcite . however , at thicker films , @xmath94 decreases , suggesting that @xmath53 grows faster than @xmath136 ; the mobility of particles increases .",
    "this is consistent with saffman s equation incorrectly yielding a surface viscosity @xmath120 that is too low for the thicker films .",
    "we also note that the parameter @xmath104 is nearly constant for _ all _ soap films .",
    "this is very surprising , as the logarithmic cut - off in the decay of the correlation functions can arise from three possible factors : 1 ) finite size of the film ; ( 2 ) inertial effects ; and ( 3 ) viscous drag on the soap film from the bulk air phases .",
    "the size of the frame used to house the film is of order @xmath40 1 cm , which is too large to explain the values of @xmath52 obtained from fits to the correlation functions .",
    "inertial effects arise at length scales given by @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the fluid density and @xmath139 is a typical probe particle speed .",
    "this gives length scales of order @xmath40 1 m , which is again too large to explain our fit - derived length scales .",
    "finally , the viscous cut - off length scale is given by @xmath140 .",
    "clearly , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : b - vs - eta ] , this length scale must increase as the effective surface viscosity increases .",
    "therefore , the near - constant value of @xmath104 for soap films over a range of @xmath141 remains a mystery .",
    "note that none of these potential origins for @xmath52 would predict any dependence on the particle size @xmath2 ; that is , they might predict a film - independent @xmath52 but not a constant @xmath104 as we find ( from data including two different particle sizes @xmath2 differing by a factor of 2.4 ) .",
    "one additional particle - based explanation for the constant value of @xmath104 could be capillary effects .",
    "capillary effects arise from deformation of the interface by the particle , with an energy gain obtained when two particles stick to each other . however , it is nt obvious that this moderately short range interaction would lead to such a very long length scale as we observe ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "we leave the reasons for the constant value of @xmath104 as a matter for future research .",
    "we have used the technique of two - particle microrheology to characterize the flow fields in soap films of varying thickness @xmath1 , where @xmath143 ( based on probe diameter @xmath2 ) . in particular , we determine the ` eigenmobilities ' of thermally correlated motions of probe particles in these soap films .",
    "these eigenmobilities consist of correlated motion parallel and perpendicular to the lines joining the centers of pairs of particles , and rigid and relative motion as well .",
    "the eigenmobilities are found to split around a mean value and decay logarithmically as a function of particle separation for all soap films .",
    "the flow fields of all films we observe are well described by theoretical models .",
    "a study of the fit parameters shows that thin films have a simple behavior , where a surface viscosity @xmath11 predicted by trapeznikov over 50 years ago correctly describes both one - particle and two - particle motions @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the thinnest films , our results suggest that prior theoretical work should be modified slightly to use @xmath11 @xcite . in our work",
    "we also a transition from ` pure-2d ' to ` 3d - influenced ' behavior at @xmath144 . for thicker films ,",
    "two - particle correlations still follow the predicted form for a quasi-2d fluid , with surface viscosity @xmath11 . however , one - particle motion is faster than expected , and other significant deviations from the thin - film behavior are noted .",
    "the results of our study on soap films can have important consequences for other 2d systems , including but not limited to microfluidic flow in confined geometries , protein and surfactant monolayers at an air water interface and the cell membrane .",
    "funding for this work was provided by the national science foundation ( dmr-0804174 ) and the petroleum research fund , administered by the american chemical society ( 47970-ac9 ) .",
