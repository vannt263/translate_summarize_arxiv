    "alternatively , the large @xmath11 ( relative to the assumed wj1 radiation field ) suggests that enough negatively charged large molecules ( e.g. , pah s ) could be present for charge exchange reactions ( x@xmath34 + lm@xmath35 @xmath36 x@xmath37 + lm@xmath37 ) to significantly enhance the column densities of the trace neutral species  in which case @xmath11 ( ) would be too high ( lepp & dalgarno 1988 ; lepp et al .",

    "ratio , moderate pressure , and stable velocity suggest that it is relatively quiescent",

    "the steadily increasing column densities of and and the high fractional ionization suggest that the line of sight is moving into / through the partially ionized edge of the iv cloud due to the motion of the background star .",

    "a lower limit of 150 pc is provided by the lack of iv absorption toward @xmath40 psc ( @xmath412away , but toward detectable iv emission ) ; the upper limit ( 2800 pc ) is set by hd 219188 itself .",
    "the length scale in the iv cloud probed by the stellar proper motion is thus between 2 and 38 au / year  considerably smaller than the 10@xmath1810@xmath19 au scales sampled by the binary star studies .",
