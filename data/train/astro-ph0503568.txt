    "<S> when ( i ) the mass in these ` oligarchs ' is roughly comparable to the mass in planetesimals and ( ii ) the surface density in oligarchs exceeds 23 g @xmath2 at 1 au , strong dynamical interactions among oligarchs produce a high merger rate which leads to the formation of several terrestrial planets . in disks with lower surface density , </S>",
    "<S> milder interactions produce several lower mass planets . in all disks , </S>",
    "<S> the planet formation timescale is @xmath3 10100 myr , similar to estimates derived from the cratering record and radiometric data . </S>"
