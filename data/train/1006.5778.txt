    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite which contains some statements about essential self - adjointness of schrdinger operators on graphs . in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that on any metrically complete weighted graph with bounded degree , the laplacian is essentially self - adjoint and the same holds for the schrdinger operator provided the associated quadratic form is bounded from below .",
    "these results remind those in the context of riemannian manifold in @xcite and also in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are many recent independent researches in locally finite graphs investigating essential self - adjointness ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and relations between stochastic completeness and essential self - adjointness ( see @xcite , @xcite as well as the thesis @xcite ) .",

    "for any given positive function @xmath3 , a weighted distance @xmath4 can be defined on @xmath0 .",
    "thus we have the usual notion of completeness for @xmath0 as a metric space .",

    "the proof is derived from the existence of the solution for a dirichlet problem at infinity , established in section [ dirichlet ] . in section [ noncomp ] , we establish some conditions implying essential self - adjointness .",
    "more precisely , defining the metric @xmath4 with respect to the weights @xmath8 given by @xmath9 and addressing the case of metrically non complete graphs , we get the essential self - adjointness of @xmath10 provided the potential @xmath11 is bounded from below by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the maximal degree and @xmath14 the distance to the boundary .",
    "we use for this result a technical tool deduced from agmon - type estimates and inspired by the nice paper @xcite , see also @xcite .",
