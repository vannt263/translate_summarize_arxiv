    "the zba in the final term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finaldos ] ) occurs because the phase space for low energy triplet excitations is reduced when @xmath2 increases .",
    "as we discus elsewhere,@xcite this calculation sheds light on the empirical observation , made for larger systems , that the width of the zba is of order @xmath2.@xcite a nave argument based on the disorder - free hubbard model would suggest that the zba might have a conventional altshuler - aronov form , but with an effective exchange interaction @xmath215 , so that the zba should grow with increasing @xmath56 .",
    "as we have said above , there are contributions to the density of states of this type ; however , we have just shown that a much larger effect , of order @xmath2 , comes from configurations with the lho and uho on neighboring sites degenerate .",
    "we note that this explanation appears to contradict numerical evidence from the work of chiesa et al.@xcite on two - dimensional clusters that a large zba persists far from half - filling and for large @xmath1 , since configurations with a degenerate lho and uho do not occur in these cases ; as we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] , the zba vanishes rapidly ( with increasing disorder ) in the two - site model when @xmath20 is outside the central plateau . to check this ,",
    "we have performed preliminary exact diagonalization calculations for larger clusters ( up to 12 sites ) .",
    "these calculations find that the width of the zba is not linear in @xmath2 when @xmath20 is outside the central plateau , and suggest that the physics of the zba changes far from half - filling .",
    "a more detailed study of how the zba evolves with doping needs to be undertaken .",
    "in summary , we have found that the zero bias anomaly in the two - site anderson - hubbard model is the result of strong orbital hybridization in the two - electron ground state for configurations with @xmath216 or with @xmath217 . unlike in the conventional hubbard model",
    ", this hybridization is not suppressed by the on - site interaction @xmath1 , and leads to a level repulsion between molecular orbital energies of order @xmath2 , rather than @xmath56 .",
    "the mechanism for the suppression of the tunneling density of states is , at least in part , different from in conventional mean - field models of interacting electrons . in mean - field theories ,",
    "interactions cause a shift of molecular orbital energies away from @xmath20 that leads directly to an increase in the energy required to remove or add an electron .",
    "this also occurs in the anderson - hubbard model ; however , there is an additional depletion of low energy spectral weight because the low energy triplet excitation spectrum is gapped as a result of orbital hybridization .",
    "this mechanism is physically different from that of altshuler and aronov .",
