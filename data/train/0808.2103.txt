    "recently k2k collaboration has reported experimental results on the inclusive single pion production induced by charged current by neutrinos in the energy region of 0.4 - 3 gev@xcite .",
    "similar results were earlier reported by miniboone collaboration in the energy region of 1gev @xcite .",
    "the study of the energy dependence of the pion production cross sections in neutrino reactions for nuclei in this energy is important in modeling the neutrino nucleus cross sections for various monte carlo neutrino event generators used in analyzing the present neutrino oscillation experiment at miniboone , k2k and future experiments to be done by t2k@xcite and no@xmath3a @xcite collaborations .    the present experimental result by k2k collaboration reports the energy dependence of the ratio of inclusive cross sections of the charge current induced pion production and quasielastic reaction in neutrino reaction on polystyrene(@xmath4 ) target .",
    "both of these reactions are influenced by the nuclear medium effects in the energy region of this experiment .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of single pion production in this reaction uses the rein and sehgal model@xcite which does not include any nuclear medium effect in the production process .",
    "the neut generator used in the analysis of k2k experiment@xcite , however , includes the nuclear effects arising due to final state interactions of pions with the nucleus like pion absorption and pion scattering @xcite . the quasielastic reaction , on the other hand , uses smith - moniz model @xcite which does not include the effect of nuclear medium arising due to nucleon - nucleon correlations but includes only the effect of pauli principle and fermi motion in a fermi gas model .",
    "there are many calculations for the nuclear medium effects in the quasielastic reaction  @xcite-@xcite , and quite a few calculations in the case of single pion production which take into account explicitly the nuclear medium and final state interaction effects in various energy region  @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a study of nuclear medium effects in these reactions in the energy region of 0.4 - 3 gev averaged over the neutrino flux of the k2k experiment .",
    "the single pion production in this region is dominated by the resonance production in which a @xmath5 resonance is excited and decays subsequently to a pion and a nucleon .",
    "when this process takes place inside the nucleus then there are two possibilities , the target nucleus remains in the ground state leading to coherent production of pions or is excited and/or broken up leading to incoherent production of pions . in the present paper , we have considered both the production processes in the @xmath5 resonance model in the local density approximation to calculate single pion production from nuclei .",
    "the effect of nuclear medium on the production of @xmath5 is treated by including the modification of @xmath5 properties in the medium .",
    "once pions are produced , they undergo final state interactions with the final nuclei . for the incoherent pion production final state interaction",

    "<S> in this paper , we present the results of a study made for the effect of nuclear medium in the charged current induced quasielastic lepton production(ccqe ) and the incoherent and coherent one pion production ( cc1@xmath0)processes from @xmath1 in the @xmath2 energy region of 0.4 - 3gev . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results are compared with the recent experimental results for the ratio of charged current @xmath2 induced one pion production cross section to the quasielastic lepton production cross section reported by k2k collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the results for the angular and momentum distributions of leptons and pions produced in these processes . </S>"
