[ cols=\"^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     a meaningful comparison of with other sne requires the distances of the comparison objects to be derived with the same method of gclfs , because then the comparison is valid without the need for an absolute calibration of gclfs .",
    "moreover , these sne should be well observed .",
    "these two conditions are fulfilled only in the fornax galaxy cluster with its 3 ia sne , ( both in ) , and ( in ) . the light curves of the first two sne have been presented by hamuy et  al .",

    ", madore et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) recently published a cepheid distance to and quoted @xmath20mag .",

    "grillmair et  al .",

    "they explained this with a population of open clusters mixed in , presumably dating from the past merger event .",
    "preliminary results from ongoing work ( gmez et  al . , in preparation ) , however , place the tom of the entire system at the expected magnitude , but indicate a radial dependence in the sense that the tom becomes fainter at larger radii .",
    "at this moment , we have no good explanation .",
    "perhaps , the different findings correspond to the different regions in ngc1316 investigated .",
    "this issue is not yet settled .",
    "an individual distance value for ngc1316 based on planetary nebulae seems to indicate a shorter distance to this galaxy than to the fornax cluster .",
    "mcmillan et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) find @xmath22mag , but this value is based on a m31 distance modulus of @xmath23mag . adopting the now widely accepted m31 cepheid distance modulus of @xmath24mag ( e.g. stanek & garnavich @xcite , kochanek @xcite ) , the ngc1316 modulus increases to @xmath25mag , perfectly consistent with the global fornax distance .",

    "all values can be derived from the photometric data and distances shown in table  [ tab : sndata ] together with our correction equation ( [ eq : mcor ] ) .",
    "one notes that seems to be 0.3mag too faint in all three photometric bands .",
    "however , the error bars overlap with those of the other sne .",
    "thus , there is no reason to claim that this sn is peculiarly dim . on the other hand ,",
    "if one takes tonry s unpublished sbf distance modulus , which is 0.28mag greater than ours , all three sne brightnesses would agree within @xmath26mag . at any rate , it is apparent that is definitely not overluminous and",
    "can not be taken for a counter - example against the general validity of the decline - rate  colour  luminosity relation .",
    "once the absolute brightness of a supernova is known , the hubble diagram of sne ia ( hamuy et  al .",
    "@xcite ) allows the derivation of the hubble constant with an accuracy which is largely determined only by the error in the supernova brightness .",
    "the fact that the fornax sne are well observed in combination with a reliable distance makes these objects probably the best sne for this purpose .",
    "the relation between the hubble constant , the absolute corrected magnitude @xmath27 and the zero - point @xmath28 in ( [ eq : mcor ] ) reads @xmath29    taking the data from , , and presented in table  [ tab : sndata ] and the zero - points from table  [ tab : coeff ] yields a hubble constant of @xmath30 the systematic error originates from the horizontal branch magnitude , the universality of the tom , the adopted fornax distance and the error in @xmath28 .",
    "the statistical error is just the scatter from the three corrected sne absolute magnitudes .",
    "this hubble constant value is dominated by the data from the fornax sne because of the small statistical weight of .",
    "we determined the gclf distance of to be @xmath31mpc , placing this galaxy in front of the virgo cluster .",
    "although this distance is not precise enough to give a good absolute magnitude it is sufficient to show that is _ not _ an overluminous type ia sn but rather a normally bright event compared to the two fornax sne and .",
    "all gclf distances depend on the absolute luminosities of the galactic gcs .",
    "it is therefore vital to calibrate the absolute tom properly to minimise systematic errors .",
    "the most important calibration parameter is the absolute magnitude of the horizontal branch which directly enters our distance scale .",
    "the treatment of the galactic gc sample shows that the asymmetric distribution in @xmath1 and incompleteness effects in the @xmath3 band can introduce a bias in the tom of over @xmath32mag .    with the distances and the apparent decline - rates and colour - corrected magnitudes of the three sne , , and one obtains an absolute corrected peak magnitude of type ia sne .",
