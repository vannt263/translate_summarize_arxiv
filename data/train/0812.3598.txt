    "clusters of galaxies are the largest bound structures of the universe and , according to hierarchical scenarios of structure formation , the latest ones to form .",
    "they are filled by a hot ( @xmath3 k ) plasma , called intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , and thus radiate in soft x - ray bands through thermal bremsstrahlung . in hierarchical cosmological scenarios , the most massive clusters form as a result of merging of smaller clusters .",
    "the current scenario predict that a fraction of the energy dissipated during the merging is channeled into particles acceleration via shocks and turbulence ( e.g. sarazin 1999a ; blasi , gabici & brunetti 2007 ) .",
    "this lead to a complex population of primary protons and electrons in the icm .",
    "models predict that a large population of _ secondary electrons _ could be injected by collisions between relativistic and thermal protons in the icm .",
    "alternatively , the icm relativistic electrons population could be _ re - accelerated in situ _ by various mechanisms associated with turbulence in massive merger events .",
    "the recent observation of a radio halo with a very steep synchrotron spectrum in abell  521 by brunetti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) supports the turbulence acceleration mechanism .",
    "this electron population is expected to be responsible for both the synchrotron radio emission and the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the origin of the latter emission is disputed .",
    "it has been proposed that it is due to inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of relativistic electrons with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( atoyan & vlk 2000 , ensslin & biermann 1998 , sarazin 1999b ) , or to a population of pev electrons that would radiate in hard x - rays through synchrotron emission ( timokhin , aharonian & neronov 2004 , inoue , aharonian & sugiyama 2005 ) .",
    "those latter models have the disadvantage that do not explain the well - known synchrotron radio emission .",
    "extended radio emission in clusters of galaxies has been known to exist for a long time ( see e.g. feretti & giovannini 2007 ) .",
    "however , the detection of the putative hard x - ray emission has been rather elusive , apart from some rather weak and controversial detections of a hard tail in the x - ray spectrum of coma ( fusco - femiano et al .",

    "in this paper , we present and discuss archival and new radio data for the ophiuchus cluster , along with archival x - ray data . together with the published x - ray data of the cluster , we model all the data to shed light on the origin of the diffuse non - thermal emission from this cluster of galaxies . in section 2",

    "we present in table  [ all_data ] a summary of all the relevant data for the ophiuchus cluster , spanning 11 decades of energy from the radio up to gamma - rays , and which include both data from the literature and obtained by us ( this paper ) .",
    "we present the main esults of these observations in figures 1 through 4 , where we show high - resolution radio and x - ray images of the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies .",

    "( 1981 ) , and have been used in the past to model the sed from the ophiuchus cluster ( e.g. , eckert et al . 2008 , profumo et al .",
    "we note that these rather old radio data have significantly poorer resolution than is currently available with existing radio interferometer arrays , and therefore the use of higher resolution radio data might have a relevant impact on the modelling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ophiuchus cluster .",
    "in particular , the old radio data at 30 , 86 and 1400  mhz cover a too large area of sky ( see the drawn circles in figure [ fig , vla ] ) , so that the radio emission of a large amount of different sources enters into the beam , and therefore heavily overestimates the flux at those frequencies .",
    "[ fig , vla ] shows publicly archival very large array ( vla ) radio images of the ophiuchus cluster at 74  mhz ( top ) , taken as part of the vla low - frequency sky survey ( vlss ; cohen et al .",
    "2007 ) , and at 1400  mhz ( bottom ; nrao vla sky survey - nvss ; condon et al . 1998 ) .",
    "note that the two culgora data measurements at 80 and 160  mhz in table [ all_data ] were obtained with resolutions of a few arcmin .",
    "the dominant radio source appears to be cul 1709 - 231 ( ra=171229.70 , dec=-23126 ) .",
    "this source position coincides within the errors with the only radio source that is clearly detected at 74 mhz in the vlss image ( upper panel of figure [ fig , vla ] ) , which has a resolution of 80  .",
    "the emission peak ( @xmath20 jy / beam ) does indeed correspond to the source cul 1709 - 231 , for which we obtain ra=171231.30and dec=@xmath211224.26 , with a positional uncertainty of 2.6  in each coordinate . in the 74 mhz vlss image ( top panel of figure",
    "[ fig , vla ] ) , cul 1709 - 231 is extended , and has a total flux of @xmath118.0 jy . however , its position is @xmath1117 off the maximum of emission obtained with _",
    "integral _ by eckert et al .",
    "( we used fig . 1 in eckert et al . to determine the position of the maximum of emission of the _ integral _ source : ra=171224.50 , dec=@xmath212235.0 , with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath22 in each coordinate ) . since the core radius is 3.2 ( watanabe et al .",
    "2001 , eckert et al .",
    "2008 ) , it is unlikely that cul 1709 - 231 can be physically related with the core of the cluster .",
    "in fact , the very recent discovery of the radio mini - halo close to source a shows that  is not related at all with the cluster core .",
    "the archival 1400  mhz nvss image ( bottom panel of figure [ fig , vla ] ) has two times better resolution than the 74 mhz image , and shows a considerably larger number of radio sources .",
    "this comes as no surprise , since the off - source rms in the vlss image of the ophiuchus region is 220 mjy / b , while that of the nvss image is @xmath230.4 mjy / b , i.e. , the nvss image is 550 times more sensitive , and therefore is able to detect many sources that went undetected in the vlss image .",
    "in particular , we found a relatively faint ( @xmath24 mjy ) radio source ( dubbed a in the bottom panel of fig . [ fig , vla ] ) at ra=171227.47 , dec=@xmath212204.9 .",
    "this position is @xmath116  away from the optical position of an elliptical , cd galaxy at @xmath25 ( 2masx j17122774 - 2322108 ) , which may suggest that the radio emission arises from it ( see also sections [ gmrt ] , [ x - rays ] and figure [ fig , chandra ] ) .",
    "the off - source rms around this source is of about 1.0 mjy / b .",
    "very recently , govoni et al . (",
    "2009 ) and murgia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have detected a ( radio ) mini - halo in the ophiuchus cluster ( see fig . 6 in govoni et al .",
    "2009 ) , using deep vla 1400 mhz observations .",
    "murgia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) report a flux density of @xmath23106 mjy for this mini - halo , and a size of @xmath26 arcmin@xmath27 .",
    "it is also not surprising that the nvss archival image did not show evidence for the mini - halo , since the off - source rms attained by govoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) was of 0.1 mjy / b , five times deeper than the overal off - source rms in the nvss image we used ( and ten times deeper than the off - source rms around the radio emission detected from the cd galaxy - see previous paragraph - which is the relevant figure ) .",
    "thus , while both our archival nvss image and that of govoni et al . clearly detect the central , compact emitting source , the much poorer sensitivity of the public nvss image prevented us from detecting the mini - radio halo at 1400 mhz .",
    "we observed the field of the ophiuchus cluster on 23 may 2008 for about two hours , using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) near pune , india .",
    "the gmrt is an array of thirty fully steerable , parabolic radio antennas of 45 meter diameter each , spread over an area of 25 km in size .",
    "16 of the antennas are displayed along three arms , with nearly a _ ` y ' _ shape , and the remaining 14 antennas are placed within one kilometer of the central part of the array .",
    "we observed simultaneously at the sky frequencies of 240 and 607 mhz , using synthesized bandwidths of 6 and 32 mhz , respectively .",
    "we observed in spectral line mode , with channels widths of 125 khz , to be able to accurately remove the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , which affects heavily low - frequency radio observations .",
    "we used 3c  286 as flux and band - pass calibrator , and used baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) to set the flux density scale , and used b1822 - 096 as phase calibrator .",
    "we edited , flagged , and calibrated the data within the nrao astronomical imaging processing software ( _ aips _ ) .",
    "after these calibration steps , we averaged our data to increase the signal to noise ratio , resulting in effective channel widths of 1 and 2 mhz at 240 and 607 mhz , respectively .",
    "because of the small bandwidth , sources in our fields are not affected by bandwidth smearing problems .",
    "we then imaged and selfcalibrated the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig , gmrt ] ) also within _ aips _ , and corrected the images for their beamshape , yielding final resolutions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 at 240 and 607 mhz , respectively .

    "we performed an extensive search for positional coincidences of the local maxima in our 607 mhz gmrt image , using the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , aimed at confirming ( or ruling out ) the physical belonging of the radio sources to the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies .",
    "the search for counterparts was performed within a 3radius from the given positions and we summarize our results in table  [ radio_sources ] .",
    "the position of the radio and x - ray peak ( _ chandra _ , see section [ x - rays ] ) of source a lies very close to the position of 2masx j1722774 - 2322108 ( hasegawa et al .",
    "2000 ) , an elliptical cd galaxy at @xmath30=0.028 , and which is at the center of the ophiuchus cluster .",
    "source b coincides with source cul 1709 - 231 and with nvss j171224 - 231424 , which is approximately located at 1.5@xmath31 in the se direction from the local maximum of radio emission .",
    "ned classifies those sources simply as radio sources where cul 1709 - 231 is described as extended ; no redshift measurements are available for those sources .",
    "the source c coincides with the source 2masx j17115542 - 239423 , an elliptical galaxy with redshift @xmath32 , and with pmn j1711 - 2308 , located at @xmath33 in the ne direction , from the source local maximum and it is classified as a radio source with no redshift measurement available .",
    "source d - north perfectly coincides with nvss j171211 - 232705 , a radio source with no redshift measurement available .",
    "finally , the source d - south position matches extremely well with the position of 2masx j17120908 - 2328263 , an elliptical galaxy with redshift z = 0.025 , and with the source nvss j171208 - 232839 , classified as a radio source and with no redshift measurement available .",
    "we therefore consider that source a is at the center of the ophiuchus cluster , and suggest that sources c and d - south are very likely members of the ophiuchus cluster , given their redshift . visual inspection of archival ned optical images reveals that pmn j171224 - 231424 and nvss",
    "j171211 - 232705 are probably galaxies .",
    "however , spectroscopic follow - up is needed in order to determinate their redshift and confirm their cluster membership .",
    "this is very important above all for the cul 1709 - 231 , nvss j171224 - 231424 and nvss j171208 - 232839 sources , for which the image inspection reveals no clear evidence for optical counterparts .",
    "in particular , the culgora source characterization is very important in order to establish its properties and cluster membership , given that , in the past , it was confused with the central elliptical cd galaxy ( source a ) due to the poor resolution of the old radio data ( johnston et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "we also used our 240 and 607 mhz gmrt images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig , gmrt ] ) , along with the archival 74 vla image ( see fig . [",
    "fig , vla ] ) , to obtain upper limits to the diffuse , non - thermal radio emission from the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies .",
    "in particular , we used an area of @xmath26 arcmin@xmath27 , very similar to the size of the radio mini - halo found by govoni et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and centered in source a ( the core of the cluster ) .",
    "we then excised the flux density of this point - like source in our images , and present upper limits to those measurements in table [ all_data ] .",
    "these were obtained by multiplying the angular area above ( after being converted into a number of beams at each frequency ) , by the off - source rms 74,240 , and 607 mhz ( 220 , 5 , and 0.4 mjy / b , respectively ) . from the upper limits at low frequencies , and the detection of the ophiuchus cluster ( mini - halo ) at 1400 mhz , we obtain an upper limit to the ( radio ) spectral index of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "if we adopt a 3  @xmath36 upper limit to the non - detected extended radio emission , this yields an upper limit for the spectral index of @xmath37 .",

[ xrays ] ) .",
    "the new radio measurements permit to set stringent limits on the synchrotron radiation produced by a population of non - thermal electrons and positrons . in turn",
    ", this sets limits on weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter models .",
    "indeed , the pair - annihilation of wimps produces , as a result of the hadronization and decay of particles in the standard model , energetic electrons and positrons .",
    "the limits that can be set depend on the wimp model ( specifically , on the wimp mass , pair - annihilation cross section and dominant annihilation final state ) , as well as on the dark matter density profile and on the average magnetic field in the cluster .",
    "we refer the reader to totani ( 2004 ) , colafrancesco , profumo & ullio ( 2006 ) , colafrancesco , profumo & ullio ( 2007 ) , jeltema and profumo ( 2008 ) and profumo ( 2008 ) , where the multi - frequency emission from wimp annihilation has been discussed in detail .",
    "in particular , we use here the same approach as in colafrancesco et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and in profumo ( 2008 ) , and model the dark matter density distribution in the ophiuchus cluster according to what described in profumo ( 2008 ) .",
    "the new limits on the radio emission are compatible , in principle , with the wimp annihilation interpretation of the hard x - ray flux from ophiuchus presented in profumo ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , the magnetic field required to be consistent with our new measurements is extremely low , of the order of @xmath58 to @xmath59 @xmath2 g .",
    "nonetheless , we can turn our radio data into limits on wimp models . for this purpose , we make more conservative assumptions on the density profile and substructures than those made in profumo ( 2008 ) . in particular , we assume a concentration @xmath60 and a navarro , frenk and white profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that 10% of the mass belongs to substructures , and that the average concentration bias in subhalos versus the host halo is @xmath61 , which gives a weighted enhancement factor @xmath62 , in the notation of eq.(29 - 31 ) of colafrancesco et al .",

    ". we also shade in gray the region excluded by the egret limit on the gamma - ray flux ( integrated flux above 0.1 gev larger than @xmath66 ph/@xmath67 , reimer et al .",

    ", we assume a sensitivity of @xmath68 ph/@xmath69 above 1 gev . the green band shows the range of values for the pair annihilation cross section typically associated with thermal dark matter production in the early universe ( jungman , kamionkowski & griest 1996 , bertone , hooper & silk 2005 ) .",
    "the bottom panel indicates the limits we get for kaluza - klein wimp dark matter in the context of universal extra - dimensions ( hooper & profumo 2007 ) . the green line shows the typical value for the cross section expected in those models ( specifically in the minimal setup ) .",
    "we notice that with a magnetic field of the order of 1@xmath2 g , we are able to place rather stringent limits on dark matter models .",
    "the precise limits , however , depend crucially on the average magnetic field .",
    "[ fig : dm_sed ] illustrates that there exist models that fit both the vla radio data point and the hard x - ray emission from ophiuchus ( blue solid line ) .",
    "the implied needed boost factor from dark matter substructures is however very large , and the magnetic field is very small ( @xmath1150 ng ) .",
    "large boost factors can be due to either a non - standard cosmological setup or a dark matter production mechanism in the early universe , or to a more extreme substructure setup than what employed in profumo ( 2008 ) , or to a combination of both effects .",
    "clearly , for reasonable values of the magnetic field , radio data put the most stringent limits on dark matter annihilation in the ophiuchus cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm_sed ] , the magic  i and magic  ii imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( iact ) sensitivities are also shown , as in the following sed plots , as reported in carmona et al .",

    "although slightly : for instance , employing @xmath70 instead of 10 we get a reduction of less than 10% in the overall normalization factor .",
    "we also considered inverse compton ( ic ) models , where the hard x - ray emission is due to ic scattering of a population of non - thermal electrons off the cosmic microwave background .",
    "we assume that the electron population responsible for the hard x - ray emission has a spectral distribution of the form :    @xmath71,\\ ] ]    i.e. a power - law with index @xmath72 plus an exponential cut - off at electron energy equal to @xmath73 .",
    "the election of such a relativistic electron distribution is justified , since radio mini - halos can be explained in terms of primary relativistic electrons re - accelerated by magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence ( ferrari et al .",
    "the importance of this mechanism was recently confirmed by brunetti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who also noticed that spectrum cut - offs are a well - known signature of the turbulence acceleration , implying a corresponding cut - off in the emitting electron population .",
    "we note that due to the exponential cut - off in the electron population , there is not an analytical solution that directly links the index @xmath72 of the electron population with the observed radio spectral index discussed in section [ sources ] .",
    "we set the normalization @xmath74 to obtain the best possible fit to the _ integral _ hard x - ray data ( eckert et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we then compute the integrated gamma - ray flux and the maximal value for the magnetic field compatible at the 95% c.l .",

    "shown are also the lines of constant magnetic field , as it is evident from this graphic , very low ( @xmath750.015@xmath2 g ) values of the magnetic field are excluded by the egret data .",
    "similarly , values significantly higher than @xmath110.3@xmath2 g can be mostly excluded because they enter into conflict with the _",
    "xmm_-newton data , or require unreasonable high , or low , values of @xmath72 .",
    "the preferred values for the average magnetic is in the range from @xmath110.02@xmath2 g up to @xmath110.3@xmath2 g . the bottom panel of fig .",

    "this plot also shows that future high - sensitivity , high - angular resolution radio data , along with sensitive measurements at high energies will be of much use to further constrain the sed of ophiuchus within this scenario .      another plausible scenario to account for both the radio and hard x - ray data",
    "is that outlined in inoue , aharonian & sugiyama ( 2005 ) , who find that very high energy protons resulting from strong accretion shocks produce high energy ( tev - pev ) electron - positron pairs via interactions with the cosmic microwave background , which then radiate synchrotron and inverse compton emission , peaking respectively at hard x - ray and tev gamma - ray energies . for simplicity",
    ", we modelled the injected electron - positron spectrum as mono - energetic , at an energy specified by the parameter @xmath76 .",
    "we then computed the equilibrium spectrum by accounting for ic , synchrotron , bremsstrahlung and compton energy losses , and neglected spatial diffusion .",
    "the resulting electron - positron equilibrium spectrum shows a spectral index @xmath77 at large energies ( between where ic and synchrotron energy losses dominate , @xmath78 gev , and the cutoff energy @xmath73 ) , and a sharp cut - off at @xmath79 .",
    "we then fitted for the hard x - ray data and computed the emission at all other frequencies after having re - normalized the electron - positron flux appropriately .",
    "we studied the @xmath80 plane ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pev ] ) .",
    "the yellow area is excluded by the radio data , while the gray area is ruled out by the egret constraints on the gamma - ray emission from the ophiuchus cluster .",
    "we also show in the bottom panel the sed of two models in agreement with the _ integral _ non - thermal detection .",
    "note that both models give comparable synchrotron fluxes ( from radio to x - rays ) , due to a degeneracy of the @xmath76 and @xmath81 parameters , as it is apparent in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pev ] .",
    "the ic peak , instead , depends on the normalization of the electron - positron flux , and this in turn depends only on the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , larger magnetic fields imply a suppressed ic emission . as the red dashed model shows , ic models with a soft injection spectral index ( @xmath82 ) , and that explain both radio and hxr data are generically in tension with the egret constraint on the gamma - ray flux .",
    "the high energy tail of the synchrotron emission is at a level compatible with the non - thermal hard x - ray data reported by _ integral _ , but is not compatible with the upper limit to the non - thermal emission in the soft x - ray band that we measured from the _ xmm_-newton data .",
    "in addition , the non - thermal soft x - ray emission predicted by the pev models largely exceeds the thermal bremsstrahlung measured by _",
    "integral _ , and therefore this family of models can be ruled out .",
    "we present high resolution 240 and 607 mhz gmrt radio observations , complemented with 74 mhz archival vla radio observations of the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies , whose mini - radio halo has been recently detected at 1400 mhz .",

    "this result is in agreement with previous ones by fujita et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which suggested that the central region of the ophiuchus cluster is a cooling core . in turn , this result is consistent with the occurrence of a mini - halo , as expected to be found in hot clusters with cool cores , and therefore support the conclusion by fujita et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that ophiuchus is not the result of a major merger .",
    "we also used the _ xmm - newton _ data to set up an upper limit to the ( non - thermal ) x - ray emission from the cluster and therefore constrain the sed of the ophiuchus cluster .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the radio and x - ray data have allowed us to study separately the diffuse emission of the cluster core from that due to the population of point sources .",
    "in particular , we have found a relatively bright radio and x - ray ( _ chandra _ ) point source at the center of the cluster ( source a in our images ) , which is spatially coincident with the _ integral _ hard x - ray source .",
    "the flat radio spectrum of this point source and the lack of non - thermal emission has allowed us to associate it to a low - level agn activity , most likely associated to the cd central galaxy 2masx j17122774 - 2322108 .",
    "this central source is very unlikely to be responsible for the hard x - ray emission detected by _",
    "integral _ , in spite of its apparent spatial coincidence .    neither our newly obtained radio data at 240 and 607 mhz , nor the archival vla data at 74 mhz for the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies detect significant diffuse radio emission from the mini - halo in ophiuchus , which has been recently at 1400 mhz .",
    "the radio and x - ray non - thermal data have dramatic implications for currently proposed scenarios to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies .",

    "we notice that for a magnetic field value comparable with the expectations from faraday rotation measures ( @xmath83 g ) , glast - fermi and high - resolution radio searches for a diffuse signal from galaxy clusters will have a comparable and complementary reach in the particle dark matter parameter space .",
