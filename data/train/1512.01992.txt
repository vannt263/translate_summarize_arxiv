    "continuous , high - precision , photometric observations obtained with _ microvariability and oscillation of stars ( most ) _ and _ convection rotation and planetary transits ( corot ) _ space telescopes significantly contributed to the knowledge of a variety of mechanisms causing stellar variability of t  tauri stars occurring on time scales of weeks and days .",
    "in particular , our first , long , nearly uninterrupted _ most _ light curves of the classical t  tauri - type star ( ctts ) tw  hya @xcite and the _ corot _ light curves of several cttss - members of the young cluster ngc  2264 @xcite , permitted the first observational tests of theoretical three - dimensional magneto - hydrodynamical ( 3d mhd ) models of plasma accretion on a magnetised star from the inner accretion discs @xcite .",
    "the results of these numerical simulations are presented in detail in the series of papers by @xcite .    according to the authors of these theoretical investigations , for magnetospheres a few times the stellar radius in size ,",
    "the accretion from the surrounding disc can occur in a stable , a moderately stable or an unstable regime .",
    "the regime of accretion which dominates at a given time is determined by several factors : the magnetic field strength , the star s rotation rate , the misalignment angle @xmath2 between the stellar rotational axis and the magnetic poles ; however , the dominant factor is the mass accretion rate @xcite . for a low value of the accretion rate ,",
    "stable accretion takes the form of steady plasma flows from the inner disc toward the stellar magnetic poles in two funnels encircling the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the funnels produce two antipodal , banana - shaped hot spots which are almost stationary on the star .",
    "the resulting light curves of such a ctts are modulated with the rotational frequency of the star only .",
    "an increased mass - accretion rate may lead to substantial diversification of plasma density in the inner accretion disc and to an onset of rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities .",
    "the instabilities produce a few equatorial tongues , in which the plasma is first transferred directly from the disc toward the star , but ultimately it is wound along stellar magnetic field lines , which form miniature funnel flows .",
    "the plasma impacts the star at moderate latitudes ( 35 - 65  deg ) and produces hot spots which are smaller than those produced by the stable accretion funnels @xcite .",
    "the chaotic behaviour of the tongues and the resulting small hot spots lead to progressively more chaotic light curves as more spots are formed : while at the beginning of the rt instabilities the funnel component still produces a single peak at the stellar rotation frequency ( though not as steady as for the purely stable case ) , as time progresses the frequency spectrum of the star brightness starts to show increasingly more additional peaks produced by the complex hot - spot distribution around the star .",
    "this stage is called a moderately stable accretion regime .    in the fully unstable regime , for mass accretion rates",
    "higher by more than an order of magnitude than in the stable regime , the hot spots are created by only a few unstable tongues rotating around the star with angular velocity of the inner disc .",
    "as the shape , intensity , number and position of the hot spots change on the inner - disc dynamical timescale , the resulting phenomena are highly chaotic and no stellar - rotation frequency is detectable in complex light curves or their fourier or wavelet spectra .",
    "the type of accretion may alternate between the different regimes depending on changes in the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "this was likely observed in tw  hya , where the accretion regime was found to switch between a moderately stable and an unstable regime @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was also found in the classical t  tau star 2mass  06401258 + 1005404 observed twice by _",
    "corot _ ; in 2008 the star showed a light - curve modulated with a stable spot , while in 2011 the light curve was irregular and dominated by accretion bursts @xcite .",
    "prompted by the most recent results obtained for tw  hya @xcite , both the probable discovery of the accretion - regime alternation and the discovery of short - term occultations , we used _",
    "most _ in a continuation of our previous , already cited work , but within a broader context of investigation of young stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the present analysis , we have chosen two well - known southern stars ru  lup and i m  lup , the brightest among the six known cttss in the lupus  2 star forming region @xcite .",
    "both stars could be observed simultaneously in the same _ most _ field .",
    "we describe previous results obtained for our targets in section  [ history ] .",
    "the high - cadence data for ru  lup and i m  lup obtained with the _ most _ satellite during 4 weeks in 2012 and 2013 are described in section  [ observations ] . in the same section ,",
    "we describe supplementary multicolour observations of these stars obtained in 2013 at the south african astronomical observatory ( _ saao _ ) and long - term , 20012009 all sky automated survey ( _ asas _ ) data .",
    "the spectroscopic data obtained during 2000 , 2002 , 2005 , 2008 and 2012 in the public - domain at the european southern observatory ( _ eso _ ) using the _ la silla 3.6  m _ and _ cerro paranal vlt - ut2 _ telescopes are described in section  [ spectra ] .",
    "we summarise and discuss the results obtained in the context of recent theoretical investigations of accretion flow in magnetised stars in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the major peculiarity of the star with the spectrum dominated by strong and broad emission lines was first noticed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the emission lines of ru  lup belong the broadest among cttss : the h@xmath3 emission line equivalent width @xmath4 is always larger than 100   , with maximum value as large as 216  @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the emission lines and the severe veiling of the absorption spectrum ( first detected by @xcite ) are likely produced by a hot and very bright source .    large and irregular light variations of ru  lup",
    "have been observed over long time scales in harvard photographic plate data obtained between 1893 and 1912 showing variability in the range of 911  mag @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by numerous observations by amateur astronomers in the twentieth century , who observed variability in the similar range of 8.612.8 mag @xcite .",
    "although the first photoelectric observations of @xcite , as analysed by @xcite , indicated a quasi - periodic oscillation at a period of @xmath5  d , their subsequent analysis of @xcite questioned the statistical significance of this detection .",
    "the authors were also unable to find any periodicity in the second data - set of ru  lup observations published by @xcite .",
    "irregular variability of this star was confirmed with more accurate broad - band observations in the whole optical  ir spectral range of photometric bands between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "as firmly stated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the greatest amplitude of light variations is observed in the @xmath6-filter , its value slowly decreasing towards longer wavelengths , with the star being redder ( or better said  less blue ) when fainter . in accordance with findings from spectroscopy",
    ", the authors proposed that this could be due to rotation of the spotted stellar surface containing a hot source with an estimated temperature @xmath8 of @xmath9  k.    once the model of magnetically - controlled accretion was formulated for ctts @xcite and successfully applied for interpretation of new multi - wavelength data of ru  lup by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite proposed that the observed variability and its spectral properties could be produced by a hot , ring - like accretion belt ( 6500  k ) formed around the two magnetic poles on the star",
    ". the ring could occupy about 30% of the stellar surface .",
    "the hot - spot properties were later substantially modified by @xcite : based on the veiling factors @xmath10 , measures changes in depth of absorption lines due to some , frequently unexplained , emission component : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the absorption - line equivalent widths of an unveiled reference spectrum and a veiled t  tauri star , respectively . ] which decrease monotonically from @xmath14 at 4091    to @xmath15 at 6210   , the authors proposed a hot spot with @xmath16  k , but with a smaller 3 - 6% surface filling factor .",
    "@xcite found that the majority of the observed luminosity of the star is produced by accretion processes and only 10% by the star itself .",
    "this circumstance leads to difficulties in determination of ru  lup s stellar parameters .",
    "the authors estimated the stellar parameters as follows : the effective temperature @xmath17  k ( sp m0.5 ) , the luminosity @xmath18  l@xmath19 and the radius @xmath20  r@xmath19 . from its position on the hertzsprung - russell diagram they estimated the mass to be smaller than a solar mass , the age at about 1  myr and the mass accretion rate at @xmath21  m@xmath19  yr@xmath22 .",
    "@xcite proposed a slightly lower rate of @xmath23  m@xmath19  yr@xmath22 . based on their estimate of the interstellar extinction of @xmath24 , distance 140  pc , and veiling factors given by @xcite",
    ", they modified the stellar parameters to @xmath25  l@xmath19 and @xmath26  r@xmath19 .",
    "the age remained similar as before ( 23  myr ) , while the mass was lowered to 0.6 - 0.7  m@xmath19 .",
    "@xcite re - determined some parameters using the spectral region 59055965    where the spectrum shows no obvious emission components associated with metallic lines , as follows : @xmath27  k , surface gravity @xmath28 , the mean radial velocity @xmath29  km / s , and spectral lines rotational broadening @xmath30  km / s , where @xmath31 is the inclination angle between the stellar rotational axis and the observer line of sight .",
    "they concluded that such a small value of the spectral line broadening , as well as the presence of emission lines containing blueshifted signatures of the collimated outflow , indicate that ru  lup is observed at a low inclination angle .",
    "although no obvious periodic signal is present in any photometric data , @xcite found a period of @xmath32  d using the cross - correlation function analysis of the radial velocity variations .",
    "the periodicity appeared to be stable over many years .",
    "assuming that this is the rotational period of the star , and that the stellar radius is 1.64  r@xmath19 , the mass 0.65  m@xmath19 and the observed @xmath33  km / s , they determined the inclination of ru  lup at 24  deg . in order to explain the observed amplitude in radial velocity changes ( 2.2  km / s ) , which is anti - correlated with the bi - sector of the absorption lines",
    ", the authors concluded that ru  lup must be covered by relatively large , cold spots .",
    "one possibility is a single spot with a radius of more than 30  deg , an average temperatures in the range 3000 - 3600  k and a magnetic field strength of 3 kg .",
    "the authors did not find any short - term correlation between the measured radial velocities and the simultaneous , moderate - quality photometric _",
    "_ data . in the following sections of the paper",
    "it becomes obvious that the expected signal variations from the large cold spot ( 0.15  mag , at most ) is totally suppressed by irregular variations of much larger amplitude due to unstable accretion .",
    "in contrast to ru  lup , i m  lup shows a typical absorption - line spectrum free of any obvious peculiarities . in spite of the young age of 1  myr , 1.8  myr or 2.5  myr , as respectively derived by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , lack of any optical veiling and rather weak emission lines prompted the previous investigators to classify i m  lup as a chromospherically active , weak - lined t  tauri - type star ( wtts ) .",
    "the hydrogen emission is relatively weak , with @xmath4 occasionally as small as 5.2    @xcite , 4.7    @xcite , 4    @xcite or even 2.85.2    @xcite .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than the traditional limit of 10    defining the borderline between ctts and wtts . yet",
    ", there is strong evidence that the above classification is incorrect and the star belongs to the class of classical t  tauri stars . @xcite observed the hydrogen line emission of i m  lup at a much higher level with @xmath4 staying for two years at an average level of 17    and varying within the range of 7.521.5   .",
    "considerable asymmetry of the @xmath34 profiles in i m",
    "lup @xcite supports the view of an ongoing accretion and thus its ctts membership .",
    "as stated by @xcite , wtts are generally expected not to show accretion , but for many ctts the @xmath4 is variable , suggesting a low or variable mass - accretion rate .",
    "the authors estimate the mass accretion rate in i m  lup at only @xmath35  m@xmath19  yr@xmath22 .",
    "other evidence of the ctts membership of i m  lup came with the discovery of a large ( 400700  au ) , gas - rich accretion disc @xcite .",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "high - contrast images , @xcite determined its inclination at @xmath36  deg .",
    "they confirmed that the disc is large , 400  au across , for the _",
    "hipparcos s _ spacecraft derived distance @xmath37  pc ( as given by @xcite ) and massive , 0.1  m@xmath19 . from spectral energy distribution modelling , they estimated the value of the inner disc radius at 0.15  au .",
    "recent sub - mm observations of @xcite show that the disc is in keplerian rotation around a central mass of @xmath38  m@xmath19 .",
    "the authors discovered a break in the surface density of the disc , which initiated space- and ground - based searches for a jupiter - like planet around the star @xcite .",
    "the first set of stellar parameters of i m  lup , as derived by @xcite , was recently refined by @xcite .",
    "with the assumption of a distance of @xmath39  pc @xcite they obtained @xmath40  k ( sp .  m0v ) , @xmath41 , @xmath42  r@xmath19 , @xmath43  l@xmath19 , @xmath44  mag and age of 1  myr . from the high - resolution _ harps _",
    "spectra @xcite obtained @xmath45  km / s . using @xmath42  r@xmath19 and @xmath46  deg of @xcite or @xmath47  deg of @xcite , and assuming that the accretion disc is coplanar with the stellar equator",
    ", one can estimate possible values of the rotational period at @xmath48 and @xmath49  d , respectively .",
    "interestingly @xcite found the signature of a 7.42  d period in archival photometric data , although the significance of this periodicity was very low and the authors concluded that i m  lup is an irregularly variable star .",
    "the _ most _ satellite has been described several times in our previous papers of this series , as listed in section  [ intro ] .",
    "the pre - launch characteristics of the mission are described by @xcite and the initial post - launch performance by @xcite .",
    "the satellite observes in one broad - band filter covering the spectral range of 350  700  nm with effective wavelength similar to that of the johnson @xmath0-filter .",
    "the _ most _ observations of ru  lup and i m  lup were done simultaneously , with both stars in the same field of the satellite .",
    "the first series of observations , conducted in _ direct - imaging _ data - acquisition mode , took place over 28.216 days between 13 april and 12 may , 2012 , during 368 satellite orbits .",
    "encouraged by the first results , we re - observed the stars during the next observing season between 13 april and 8 may , 2013 , over 25.932 days during 334 satellite orbits .",
    "the stars are not in the continuous visibility zone of the satellite so that their observations were interrupted for 40 - 70  min during each satellite orbit by observations of secondary targets , and occasionally for @xmath50  d by time - critical observations of other targets . as a result ,",
    "the effective total time coverage for our targets during the 2012 and 2013 runs was 12.043 days ( 42.7% ) and 8.331 days ( 32.1% ) , respectively .",
    "the individual exposures were always 60  s long .",
    "for photometric reductions , the _ dark _ and _ flat _ calibration frames were obtained by averaging a dozen empty - field images specifically taken during each run .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out on the _ dark- _ and _ flat- _ corrected images by means of the daophot  ii package @xcite .",
    "as in our previous investigations , weak correlations between the stellar flux , its position on the chip , and the sky background level within each _ most _ orbit were removed .",
    "we obtained a well - defined light curves expressed in heliocentric julian days @xmath51 and normalized flux units ( figure  [ fig.dat ] , the left side panels ) for almost the whole duration of the observations , with typical error ( i.e. the standard deviation ) of a single data point of 0.0100.011  mag ( ru  lup ) and 0.0160.017  mag ( i m  lup ) in the 2012 and 2013 runs , respectively .",
    "in addition to the targets , the nearby bright gcs  07838 - 00926 companion , separated by 20  arcsec from i m  lup was also analysed in the same way .",
    "the star remained constant during 2012 and 2013 .",
    "the light variations of ru  lup in the _ most _ data appear to be irregular with no sign of any periodic features , either in the 2012 or in the 2013 light curves .",
    "this behaviour is typical for type  ii , irregular and accretion - burst classes , as defined by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the light curves of i m  lup show a fairly stable 78  d periodicity , which is typical for type  iip or spot - like cttss , as defined in @xcite and @xcite classification schemes .",
    "only a part of the 2012 light curve of i m  lup is disturbed by small - scale , irregular variations , which disappeared after @xmath52 .",
    "interestingly , while the 2012 light curve shows regularly repeating maxima , the 2013 one shows a sequence of alternating higher and smaller brightness increases whose shape evolves slightly during each double - period sequence .",
    "we note that the second light curve is very similar to the synthetic curve obtained for the case of a stable accretion regime by @xcite ( see in fig .  5 of their paper ) .",
    "in addition , we also carefully examined the light curves of ru  lup and i m  lup for the presence of short brightness dips like those observed for tw  hya @xcite , with negative result .",
    "we performed frequency analysis of the light curves in a similar way as in our previous papers of this series ( see section  4.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the bootstrap sampling technique permitted evaluation of the mean standard errors of the amplitude @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the frequency ( fig .  [ fig.dat ] , the right panels ) .",
    "we used all data points gathered by _",
    "most _ in the fourier spectrum calculations for ru  lup . for i",
    "m  lup , we removed the first 8 days of the 2012 data due to highly irregular light variations which appear to spoil the primary signal in the fourier spectrum . also the long - term ascending trend visible in the 2013 i m  lup light curve was removed by a simple parabolic fit , as it had measurable impact on the amplitude and the period obtained from the frequency spectrum .",
    "the 2012 and 2013 fourier spectra of ru  lup show dominant flicker - noise characteristics , i.e.  the amplitudes scale as @xmath55 , exactly as for tw  hya @xcite , with no single periodicity dominating in the frequency spectra .",
    "however , the corresponding spectra of i m  lup clearly show a single , very persistent signal at about 7.5  d and with amplitudes similar in both years ( figure  [ fig.dat ] , right panels ) .",
    "measurements of the central positions of the peaks result in @xmath56  c / d ( @xmath57  d ) and @xmath58  c / d ( @xmath59  d ) for the 2012 and 2013 signals , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the rotation period of the star estimated from analysis of the spectroscopic , high - contrast imaging and interferometric observations ( see the last paragraph of section  [ imlup ] ) .",
    "as demonstrated during tw  hya light - curve analyses by @xcite and @xcite , wavelets are a very useful tool for finding short - lasting regularities in apparently irregular light curves of ctts . while fourier spectra of tw  hya s 2008 and 2009 data taken over whole observing runs showed only flicker - noise characteristics , the wavelets revealed the presence of short oscillatory behaviour with quasi - periods which tended to progressively decrease with time",
    "thus , wavelets permitted a simple and direct method to follow up the time period progression versus time .",
    "+        to obtain a uniform data sampling required for the wavelet analysis of ru  lup and to remove a few interruptions in the data acquisition ( see sec .  [ mostobs ] ) , we interpolated the 368 ( 2012 ) and 334 ( 2013 ) satellite - orbit , average data points into a grid of 401 and 369 equally - spaced points at 0.07047  d intervals , for the two seasonal _ most _ runs , respectively . as in our previous investigations ,",
    "the morlet-6 wavelet provided the best match between the time - integrated power spectrum from the wavelet transform and the directly - obtained frequency spectrum of the star , as given in the previous section ( sec .",
    "[ mostfr ] ) .    the wavelet spectrum of 2012 light curve of ru  lup ( fig .",
    "[ fig.wav ] , the upper - left panel ) shows at least two drifting quasi - periodic features , which are very similar to those found in tw  hya during the phases of unstable accretion @xcite .",
    "the most pronounced is the feature which shortened its period from @xmath60 to @xmath61 d  the feature can be also visually distinguished and tracked in the light curve from the beginning of the observations until @xmath62 .",
    "the second feature is visible through the entire run and appears to shorten its period from @xmath63 to @xmath64  d by the end of the run .",
    "we also note a few short - living @xmath65  d features , which appear and disappear on a time - scale of a few days .",
    "interestingly , the 2013 wavelet spectrum of ru  lup does not show any clear period drifts for the quasi - periodic features .",
    "it is dominated by rather stable @xmath65  d features with life - time of a few days .",
    "only the second half of the light curve contains a strong @xmath64  d quasi - periodic signal .",
    "we stress , however , that the 1.9  d long break in the data , which happened to take place during the most pronounced short - periodic oscillations has a detrimental influence on the wavelet spectrum ; thus the features visible inside and close to the small trapezium region marked by white continuous lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.wav ] represent numerical artifacts only .",
    "thus , we can not fully exclude the possibility that the period drifts were present also in the 2013 data but were suppressed by the presence of the data - taking gap .",
    "we also note that none of the longer time - scale features ( around @xmath66  d ) visible in both wavelet spectra can be regarded as a real effect due to relatively short duration of the observations ; such signals are not visible directly in the light curves .",
    "we also analysed i m  lup light curves in the same way as for ru  lup . as expected , the features representing the primary @xmath677.5  d peaks in the fourier spectra and directly visible in the light curves are also prominent and stable in the wavelet spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig.wav ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "the _ most _ satellite is equipped with one broad - band filter .",
    "supplementary multicolour observations allow one to differentiate between effects caused by mechanisms suggested to explain t  tauri star variability : variable extinction , magnetic cold spots or hot spots produced by magnetospheric accretion .",
    "this is particularly important for i m  lup , for which no previous multicolour light curves were available and for which contradictory wtts vs.  ctts classifications were proposed in the past ( sec .",
    "[ imlup ] ) . for this star",
    "a wtts type is suggested by the 2012 _ most _ light curve , which looks similar to other wtts targets observed by _",
    "most _ @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we obtained multi - colour photometry of both stars at _ saao _ during 22 nights between 10 april and 7 may 2013 .",
    "the stars were observed as secondary targets following tw  hya , which was our primary target during the _ saao _ observations .",
    "we used the 0.75  m telescope equipped with _",
    "tripol _ which is a visitor instrument of the nagoya university donated to _",
    "saao_. the observed field of view of @xmath68 arcmin was split by two dichroic mirrors and then directed to three sbig st-9xei cameras through the sloan @xmath69 filters , resulting in three simultaneous images for each exposure .",
    "in addition to three times higher observing cadence , the crucial advantage of this instrument is the possibility to track colour - index variations even during non - photometric conditions which prevailed during our observations .",
    "the typical spacing of our observations was 1823  sec ( including 3  sec read - out time ) , with full range of 1333  sec , depending on the actual seeing and sky transparency .",
    "all frames were _ dark _ and _ flat - field _ calibrated in the standard way within the eso - midas package @xcite . for photometric reduction we used the c - munipack programme @xcite utilising the daophot  ii package .    we were not able to monitor brightness variations of ru  lup due to many non - photometric nights during our run .",
    "this star is isolated on the sky ( about 15  arcmin from i m  lup ) , without any suitable comparison star within the instrumental small field of view .",
    "thus , only high - quality measurements of the colour index were feasible ( fig .",
    "[ fig.mult ] , the left panel ) . in the case of i",
    "m  lup , nearby gcs  07838 - 00926 served as a convenient comparison star ; it was found to be constant in the _ most _ observations ( sect .",
    "[ mostobs ] ) .",
    "we derived its approximate sloan magnitudes on the night of 22/23 april 2013 using standard - star observations of the e600 region @xcite and the johnson - system magnitudes of the standard stars transformed to the sloan system using the equations given by @xcite : @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the light curve of i m  lup in the @xmath73-band obtained by referencing to this star is shown in figure  [ fig.mult ] . during the same night of photometric quality",
    "we frequently alternated observations of ru  lup and i m  lup , as used in the past in the era of one - channel photometers .",
    "this way we obtained an absolute calibration of ru  lup s colour indices using the interpolated observations of gcs  07838 - 00926 as reference points .",
    "a comparison of the ru  lup colour indices to that of a non - reddened main - sequence m0v star ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ; @xcite ) , shows that the star is permanently bluer .",
    "the same situation is observed for i m  lup . at first glance",
    "the blue - colour excess is well visible during the maxima and branches . during light minima",
    "the colour index are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and thus are bluer by only @xmath78  mag and @xmath79  mag than in m0v star .",
    "note , that the errors are large but they include all uncertainties related with colour transformation to the sloan system .",
    "however , the blue colour excess in i m  lup was never observed by us to decrease to zero , which may be explained by geometrical circumstances , such that before the hot spot located on the hemisphere directed towards the observer sets completely , the antipodal spot rises at the same time .",
    "we note that the colour indexes are significantly bluer in ru  lup than in i m  lup , which can be explained by the difference in the mass accretion rate of some three orders of magnitude between the two stars .",
    "the results are in accordance with the historical results ( sec .",
    "[ rulup ] ) confirming that accretion and hot spots play major roles in ru  lup s light variations .",
    "the same conclusion can be formulated for i m  lup for the first time based on results obtained in this work .           while the new _ most _ and _ saao _ observations addressed the variability of ru  lup and i",
    "m  lup in time scales of hours to about a week , an analysis of the archival _ asas _ data provided supplementary information on variability in long time - scales of days to years .",
    "the left - hand panels in figure  [ fig.datasas ] show the _ asas _ johnson @xmath0-filter light curves of ru  lup and i m  lup gathered during nine observing seasons from 2001 to 2009 .",
    "the observations were obtained at intervals of typically one to seven days . for details of the data collection and reduction ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the typical error of a single data point was 0.037  mag for both stars .",
    "the average brightness level of ru  lup was @xmath80  mag .",
    "the amplitude of light variations was moderate , @xmath81  mag and constant until @xmath82 , i.e.  the 2005 season .",
    "starting in 2006 , the light variations were dominated by a long - term quasi - periodic oscillation with amplitude gradually growing with time up to @xmath83  mag .",
    "in contrast , i m  lup was fairly constant over the whole period of nine years , with the possibility of small sinewave - like variations .",
    "the average brightness level was @xmath84  mag .",

    ", the steady plasma flow takes place from the inner disc toward the stellar magnetic poles in two funnels encircling the magnetosphere , to produce two antipodal arc - like hot spots which co - rotate with the star . depending on the inclination angle and the misalignment angle @xmath2 between the stellar rotation axis and the magnetic pole axis , either one or both hot spots can be visible to an observer during a single stellar rotation .",
    "the lack of optical veiling in i m  lup is in line with the moderate hot spot temperature of @xmath112  k , crudely estimated from the 2013 _ most _ light curve .",
    "@xcite considered shapes , widths and positions of hot spots created by stable accretion funnels .",
    "they found that for a broad range of parameters , the arc - like hot spots are formed at stellar latitudes 1618  deg below the magnetic pole , and their typical polar widths are 78  deg . in combination with the finding from the _ most _ observations of i m  lup , which in 2012 showed a fairly regular light curve likely modulated by a single spot , while in 2013 by two hot spots , the theoretical results can be used to estimate @xmath2 . assuming that the stellar equator is coplanar with the inner accretion disc , for rotation angle inclination of @xmath113  deg @xcite , the spot on the opposite hemisphere may occasionally be invisible to the observer if @xmath114  deg , with some likely variations in the hot spot latitudes , their polar widths or maybe even of @xmath2 itself .",
    "the variability phenomena of ru  lup are much more complex than in i m  lup . due to the chaotic character of light variations and a lack of any single stable periodicity in light curves , we infer that the unstable accretion regime operates in ru  lup .",
    "as noted in section  [ intro ] , in this regime , which is favoured in ctts having high mass accretion rates ( see sec .",
    "[ rulup ] ) , the hot spots are formed by a few tongues created by rt instabilities .",
    "the number , position and shape of the hot spots change on the inner disc dynamical timescale , sometimes as low as 12  d , masking the stellar rotation frequency in the frequency spectra @xcite .",
    "hence , in spite of about 52 days of continuous photometric monitoring of the star with _",
    ", we were unable to detect any stable periodicity corresponding to the persisting 3.71  d signal in radial velocities discovered by @xcite .",
    "this is fully and independently confirmed by our re - analysis of archival spectra using the broadening function approach ( sec .",
    "[ res - rulup - bf ] ) .",
    "this 3.71  d signal most likely represents the true rotational period of the star .    during the process of unstable accretion ,",
    "the 3d mhd numerical models predict the appearance of quasi - periods distributed around the value of the stellar rotational period .",
    "such 4.52  d and 54  d quasi - periodic features were indeed noticed in the 2012 light curve of ru  lup ( sec .",
    "[ wavmost ] ) . the most extreme case , however , is represented by several 21  d quasi - periods detected in 2012 and 2013 , which are apparently caused by hot spots moving relative to the photosphere with a considerably higher inner disc rotational frequency . in accord with @xcite the tongues formed through the rt instabilities originate at the inner disc radii of about 5.8  r@xmath115 , a value which is significantly smaller than the disc co - rotation radius of 8.74  r@xmath115 , evaluated from the stellar rotational period of 3.71  d and the mass of 0.65  m@xmath115 ( sec .  [ rulup ] ) .",
    "we also note that the 2012 _ most _ observations of ru  lup showed drifting quasi - periodic features , similar to tw  hya observed in 2008 and 2009 @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted in the context of the results presented in section  4.3 of @xcite , which indicate that quasi - periodic features may show a tendency towards period shortening for the increasing mass accretion rate within individual tongues .",
    "this leads to the non - linear development of rt instabilities and a local reduction of the inner - disc radius , what in turn produces a progressive increase of the rotational frequency of the tongue , and of the resulting hot spot .",
    "although the quasi - periodic features observed in ru  lup in 2013 did not show any obvious trends in the period length , the apparent absence may be due to our inability to detect them through wavelets due to the long break in the data acquisition ( see sec .",
    "[ mostobs ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig.wav ] ) .",
    "whereas the day time - scale variability appears to have direct explanation in the accretion phenomena between the inner accretion disc and the surface of the star , it is unclear what mechanism produces the long - term @xmath89  d quasi - periodic variation in ru  lup .",
    "we saw this over the span of four years in the _ asas _ observations ( sec .",
    "[ asasobs ] ) .",
    "the long time - scale suggests that the outer parts of the accretion disc where some density disturbances occur , may indirectly lead to semi - periodic light variations .",
    "one possibility is pressure scale - height perturbations or proto - planetary nuclei that can create spiral arms @xcite .",
    "we suggest that perhaps the spiral arms could lead to cyclical ( i.e. the @xmath116  d ) modulation of the inner disc plasma density and thus of the mass accretion rate , the hot - spot filling factor and associated veiling , which ultimately would affect the mean brightness of the star when averaged over monthly intervals . unfortunately the _ uves _ spectra were obtained during the first half of the _ asas _ observations , when the 258  d quasi - periodic oscillation did not seem to be present",
    ". therefore we could not find any possible correlation between the mass accretion rate estimated from the spectra , and the mean stellar brightness from the available photometric data .",
    "the more complex of the two stars , ru  lup , is similar to tw  hya , which is the best photometrically explored ctts so far from space .",
    "both stars have similar spectral type , show vigorous accretion , are visible in a pole - on orientation , and long - lasting cold spots near the magnetic poles modulate their radial velocity variations with similar periods of 3.71  d ( ru  lup ) and 3.57  d ( tw  hya , @xcite ) .",
    "the four _ most _ runs of tw  hya provided light curves showing evidence of a constantly varying accretion regime @xcite , in accordance with the @xcite prediction of alternating episodes of stable and unstable accretion , depending on the mass accretion rate .",
    "it is therefore not excluded that at times , perhaps during the brightness minimum , when @xmath0 drops down to @xmath117  mag ( see section  [ rulup ] and the previous paragraph ) , ru  lup may show accretion running in a moderately stable or even a stable regime .",
    "such events would allow one to determine the rotational period of the star from photometry @xcite.ideally , future space - based photometric observations should be followed by spectro - polarimetric observations capable of reproducing the hot spot distribution in stellar coordinates . for instance this technique applied to tw hya in 2008 , revealed polar , mid- and low - latitude brightness excess regions @xcite , indicating the presence of hot spots created both through a stable polar funnel and unstable tongues . in spite of this evidence of moderately stable accretion ,",
    "the light curve simultaneously obtained by _ most _ @xcite is dominated by clear signs of unstable accretion .    while long - term",
    ", continuous photometric monitoring of cttss from space has now become a well established tool @xcite , such observations frequently show very complex superposition of many phenomena , particularly in t  tau stars accreting in the unstable regime , such as ru  lup or tw  hya . for the determination of rotational periods ,",
    "a much more efficient approach is through the use of high - resolution spectroscopy followed by analysis using linear deconvolution methods , such as for tw  hya by @xcite or for ru  lup analyzed in this paper . unlike photometry ,",
    "such methods are sensitive to cold - spot induced line - profile variations permitting rotational period determination even from a moderate number of spectra .",
    "the radial velocity variations induced by such spots are not negligible and reach amplitudes that may exceed 2  km / s , a limitation which carries an important ramification for rv planetary searches around cttss and may explain the lack of success for the extant searches @xcite , since the required accuracy necessary for discovery of jupiter - mass planet is of the order of 100  m  s@xmath22 .",
    "linear deconvolution techniques , such as the broadening function technique , and the classical doppler imaging technique , may permit removal of the star - spot perturbations @xcite , particularly for the `` cleaner '' cttss accreting in a stable regime .",
