    "the discovery of new models of quantum computation ( qc ) , such as the one - way quantum computer @xcite and the projective measurement - based model @xcite , have opened up new experimental avenues toward the realisation of a quantum computer in laboratories . at the same time",
    "they have challenged the traditional view about the nature of quantum computation .    since the introduction of the quantum turing machine by deutsch @xcite , unitary transformations plays a central rle in qc .",
    "however , it is known that the action of unitary gates can be simulated using the process of quantum teleportation based on projective measurements - only @xcite .",
    "characterizing the minimal resources that are sufficient for this model to be universal , is a key issue .",
    "resources of measurement - based quantum computations are composed of two ingredients : ( @xmath0 ) a universal family of observables , which describes the measurements that can be performed ( @xmath1 ) the number of ancillary qubits used to simulate any unitary transformation .",
    "successive improvements of the upper bounds on these minimal resources have been made by leung and others @xcite .",
    "these bounds have been significantly reduced when the state transfer ( which is a restricted form of teleportation ) has been introduced : one two - qubit observable ( @xmath2 ) and three one - qubit observables ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , associated with only one ancillary qubit , are sufficient for simulating any unitary - based qc @xcite .",
    "are these resources minimal ? in @xcite , a sub - family of observables ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 ) is proved to be universal , however two ancillary qubits are used to make this sub - family universal .",
    "these two results lead to an open question : is there a trade - off between observables and ancillary qubits in measurement - based qc ? in this paper , we reply in the negative to this open question by proving that the sub - family @xmath7 is universal using only one ancillary qubit , improving the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement - based qc .",
    "the simulation of a given unitary transformation @xmath8 by means of projective measurements can be decomposed into :    * ( _ step of simulation _ ) first , @xmath8 is probabilistically simulated up to a pauli operator , leading to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is either identity or a pauli operator @xmath11 , or @xmath12 . *",
    "( _ correction _ ) then , a corrective strategy consisting in combinig conditionally steps of simulation is used to obtain a non - probabilistic simulation of @xmath8 .",
    "teleportation can be realized by two successive bell measurements ( figure [ fig : telep ] ) , where a bell measurement is a projective measurement in the basis of the bell states @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "a step of simulation of @xmath8 is obtained by replacing the second measurement by a measurement in the basis @xmath15 ( figure [ fig : gtelep ] ) .         up to a pauli operator ]",
    "if a step of simulation is represented as a probabilistic black box ( figure [ fig : blackbox ] , left ) , there exists a corrective strategy ( figure [ fig : blackbox ] , right ) which leads to a full simulation of @xmath8 .",
    "this strategy consists in conditionally composing steps of simulation of @xmath8 , but also of each pauli operator .",
    "a similar step of simulation and strategy are given for the two - qubit unitary transformation @xmath16 ( _ controlled_-@xmath3 ) in @xcite .",
    "notice that this simulation uses four ancillary qubits .    as a consequence ,",
    "since any unitary transformation can be decomposed into @xmath16 and one - qubit unitary transformations , any unitary transformation can be simulated by means of projective measurements only .",
    "more precisely , for any circuit @xmath17 of size @xmath18  with basis @xmath16 and all one - qubit unitary transformations  and for any @xmath19 , @xmath20 projective measurements are enough to simulate @xmath17 with probability greater than @xmath21 .    approximative universality , based on a finite family of projective measurements , can also be considered .",
    "leung @xcite has shown that a family composed of five observables @xmath22 is approximatively universal , using four ancillary qubits .",
    "it means that for any unitary transformation @xmath8 , any @xmath19 and any @xmath23 , there exists a conditional composition of projective measurements from @xmath24 leading to the simulation of a unitary transformation @xmath25 with probability greater than @xmath26 and such that @xmath27 .            in order to decrease the number of two - qubit measurements",
    " four in @xmath24  and the number of ancillary , an new scheme called _ state transfer _ has been introduced @xcite .",
    "the state transfer ( figure [ fig : statetrans ] ) replaces the teleportation scheme for realizing a step of simulation .",
    "composed of one two - qubit measurements , two one - qubit measurements , and using only one ancillary qubit , the state transfer can be used to simulate any one - qubit unitary transformation up to a pauli operator ( figure [ fig : statetransgene ] ) .",
    "for instance , simulations of @xmath28 and @xmath29  see section [ sec : unituniv ] for definitions of @xmath28 and @xmath30  are represented in figure [ fig : simulh ] . moreover",
    "a scheme composed of two two - qubit measurements , two one - qubit measurements , and using only one ancillary qubit can be used to simulated @xmath16 up to a pauli operator ( figure [ fig : simulcnot ] ) .",
    "since @xmath31 is a universal family of unitary transformations , the family @xmath32 of observables is approximatively universal , using one ancillary qubit @xcite .",
    "this result improves the result by leung , since only one two - qubit measurement and one ancillary qubit are used , instead of four two - qubit measurements and four ancillary qubits .",
    "moreover , one can prove that at least one two - qubit measurement and one ancillary qubit are required for approximative universality .",
    "thus , it turns out that the upper bound on the minimal resources for measurement - based qc differs form the lower bound , on the number of one - qubit measurements only .     and @xmath29 up to a pauli operator.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath29 up to a pauli operator.,title=\"fig : \" ]     up to a pauli operator .",
    "]    in @xcite , it has been shown that the number of these one - qubit measurements can be decreased , since the family @xmath33 , composed of one two - qubit and only two one - qubit measurements , is also approximatively universal , using _ two _ ancillary qubit . the proof is based on the simulation of @xmath3-measurements by means of @xmath4 and @xmath2 measurements ( figure [ fig : xsimul ] ) .",

    "there exist several universal families of unitary transformations , for instance @xmath35 is one of them :    @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39    we prove that the family @xmath40 is also approximatively universal :    [ thm : dd ] @xmath41 is approximatively universal .    the proof is based on the following properties .",
