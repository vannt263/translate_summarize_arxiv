    "in recent years x - ray missions such as and have demonstrated that seyfert-2 galaxies have a very complex x - ray spectrum ( see mushotzky , pounds & done 1993 for a recent review ) . in particular",
    "their spectrum contains at least the following features : a ) a power - law continuum with slope @xmath2 absorbed by a very large column ( @xmath3 ) ( eg turner & pounds 1988 ) ; this obscuring screen is probably associated with a molecular torus .",
    "b ) an fek line at 6.4 kev ie originating from neutral fe c ) a spectral curvature ( hump ) above 10 kev ; this is generally believed to originate from reflection of the power - law component on cold material ( eg lightman & white 1988 , george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "in contrast to the recent progress in understanding the spectral features of seyfert-2 galaxies , our knowledge of their x - ray variability properties remains scanty . usually , this has been based on comparison of the x - ray flux between observations from different missions spanning time intervals of several years .",
    "recently , turner et al . (",
    "1997 ) have detected some evidence for short term variability in a handful of seyfert-2 galaxies using .",
    "the systematic monitoring of seyfert-2 galaxies has become possible with the _ rxte _ mission .",
    "_ rxte _ observations of a few objects revealed strong variability in time - scales of hours as well as evidence for spectral variability ( georgantopoulos et al . 1999 , georgantopoulos & papadakis 2000 )",
    "indeed , time variability studies can provide strong constraints in understanding the geometry of the circumnuclear matter in these objects . for example , the time lags between the power - law continuum and the normalization of the fe line could constrain the origin of the line . in the case where the fe line originates in an accretion disk",
    "( as is the standard scenario for seyfert-1 galaxies ) , the fe line should closely track the variations of the intrinsic power - law .    in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of four observations of the seyfert-2 galaxies ngc 7172 and eso 103-g35 from the _ bepposax _ archive .",
    "the two observations for each galaxy are separated by a year s interval .",
    "our goal is to study any long - term variations in the spectral features between the two epochs . the broad energy band of @xmath4 as well as its good spectral resolution ,",
    "provide the opportunity to place stringent constraints on the geometry of the nuclei of eso103-g35 and ngc7172 and any surrounding gaseous media .",
    "ngc 7172 is an obscured , almost edge on galaxy .",
    "it belongs to the compact group hcg90 and has a redshift of z=0.0086 .",
    "it is classified as a type 2 seyfert galaxy .",
    "strong infrared emission from the nucleus is observed , which is variable on time scales of approximately 3 months ( sharples et al .",
    "the first x - ray observation which was performed by @xmath5 showed a @xmath6=1.84 power - law absorbed by @xmath7 ( turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "later observations with @xmath8 confirmed the above results and also indicated that a reflection component may be important ( smith & done 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore the analysis of observations ( turner et al . 1997 ) showed the presence of a 6.4 kev emission line with an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath9 ev .",
    "in contrast with the previous results they found a rather harder photon index , @xmath10 , while the amount of the absorption column remained constant .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using 2 @xmath11 observations separated by one year , found an even flatter photon index of @xmath12 absorbed by the same column density found in previous observations .",
    "they further detect short - term variability ( within a day ) of about 30 percent . until 1995 , before the _ bepposax _ observations , the flux of ngc 7172 has remained almost constant between @xmath13 3 and @xmath14 . since may 1996 the source has reached a very low flux state of @xmath15 .",

    "[ ngc7172_history ] .",
    "the heao a2 hard x - ray source 1h 1832 - 653 was identified as the s0/sa type galaxy eso 103-g35 , with a redshift of z=0.013 , by phillips et al .",
    "they classified the agn as a type 1.9 seyfert galaxy because of the weakness of @xmath16 emission line and the presence of a broad @xmath17 line .",
    "@xmath5 observations , showed a steep photon index of @xmath18 absorbed by a high column density of n@xmath19 , which was found to vary within factor of 2 in a period of 90 days possibly due to motion of material in the broad line region across the line of sight ( warwick , pounds & turner 1988 ) .",
    "later observations obtained by @xmath8 strongly suggested the presence of a narrow emission line at 6.4 kev and also of a reflection component with a photon index @xmath20 ( smith & done 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath11 observations ( turner et al . 1997 ) confirmed the previous @xmath21 results and showed strong evidence for the presence of a triplet fe line ( 6.4 , 6.68 , 6.98 kev ) .",
    "they also found a decrease by a factor of two in the continuum flux as compared to @xmath8 .",
    "finally , forster , leighly & kay ( 1999 ) , analyzing three @xmath11 observations spanning a period of @xmath132 years ( 1994 - 1996 ) , found a decrease in the ew of the fe line while the continuum flux increased by a factor of 2 .",

    "the scientific instrumentation on board the italian - dutch x - ray satellite _ bepposax _ includes a medium energy concentrator spectrometer , mecs , which consists of three units , ( boella et al 1997 ) a low energy concentrator spectrometer , lecs , ( parmar et al 1997 ) a high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter , hpgspc , ( manzo et al 1997 ) and a phoswich detector system , pds , ( frontera et al 1997 ) , all of which point in the same direction .",
    "the mecs instrument consists of a mirror unit plus a gas scintillation proportional counter and has imaging capabilities .",
    "it covers the energy range between 1 - 10 kev with a spatial resolution of about 1.4 arcmin at 6 kev and a spectral resolution of 8 per cent at 6 kev .",
    "the lecs instrument is similar to the mecs and operates in the 0.1 - 10 kev band with the same spectral and spatial resolution of the lecs .",
    "the pds is a direct view detector with rocking collimators and extends the @xmath4 bandpass to high energies ( 13 - 300 kev ) .",
    "its energy resolution is 15 per cent at 60 kev . in our analysis",
    "we use mecs and pds data only .",
    "our objects have not been detected by the hpgspc detector .",
    "we did not use the lecs data as there are nearby contaminating soft x - ray sources , most probably stars in case of eso 103-g35 , while in case of ngc 7172 the contamination is due to the presence of the hickson compact group h90 .",
    "these sources are not present in the hard mecs images .",
    "another reason for excluding the lecs data was the poor photon statistics ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we analyze here two observations of ngc7172 and eso 103-g35 both obtained with @xmath4 within an interval of about one year .",
    "more specifically , ngc7172 was first observed in 1996 ( from october 15th to 16th ) and then in 1997 ( from november 6th to 7th ) .",

    "this is feasible because the three mecs units show very similar performance and the difference in the position of the optical axis in the three units is smaller than the scale on which the vignetting of the telescopes varies significantly ( @xmath225 arcmin ) .    ._bepposax",

    "the spectral analysis of both observations implies that ngc 7172 is absorbed by a column density of n@xmath23 , in good agreement with previous @xmath5 ( turner & pounds 1989 ) , @xmath24 ( smith & done 1996 ) and @xmath11 ( turner et al 1997 ) observations .",
    "the data require the presence of an fe line at 6.4 kev . in the 1996 _ bepposax _",
    "observation the line is marginally resolved , at less than the 2@xmath25 confidence level , while in the 1997 observation ( where the photon statistics are poorer ) the line width is unconstrained .",
    "we note that the line has been resolved in previous observations ( guainazzi et al .",
    "there is some evidence ( fig .",
    "[ ngc7172_contours ] ) for a variation in the normalization of the line .",
    "this is in agreement with guainnazi at al ( 1998 ) who presented similar evidence for a variation of the line based on two @xmath26 observations ( 1995 and 1996 ) .",
    "the line variation in conjunction with the line width has important implications for the geometry of the circumnuclear matter in ngc7172 .",
    "indeed , the fe line must originate close to the nucleus possibly in the outer regions of an accretion disk .",
    "this would simultaneously explain the fact that the continuum flux variations are tracked by changes in the line flux , and the large width of the line .",
    "indeed , the line broadening may be due to the large velocities in the disk similar to that witnessed in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by tanaka et al .",
    "the observed broadening in the case of ngc 7172 implies a velocity of @xmath1370000 @xmath27 .",
    "we tried to investigate further the above hypothesis including a line from a relativistic accretion disk ( for an accretion disk viewed at an intermediate inclination angle with solar abundances ) .",
    "the fit was only marginally improved ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we note that georgantopoulos & papadakis ( 2000 ) find no significant variation of the normalization of the line in ngc 7172 using several _ rxte _ observations spanning a period of around a week .",
    "this would set a lower limit of about a light week to the size of the line emitting region .",
    "the observed ew can not be interpreted in terms of transmission processes in the torus alone . indeed leahy & creighton ( 1993 ) using monte carlo simulations found that a column density of n@xmath29 could produce an fe line ew of only @xmath30 ev .",
    "this independently suggests that a reflection component may be present .",
    "indeed , in this case the ew of the line should be increased by @xmath13150 ev due to reflection on the accretion disk ( reynolds , fabian & inoue 1995 , george & fabian 1991 ) . alternatively the observed ew may be explained on the basis of a high fe abundance .",
    "indeed , excess absorption from fe is present in the first observation of ngc 7172 at @xmath31 kev , confirming earlier reports by warwick et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; however , note that superior spectral resolution observations with the @xmath11 sis ( turner et al 1997 ) do not corroborate this result . the edge energy is consistent with a neutral or low ionization material surrounding the source ( kallman & mccray 1982 ) .",
    "the optical depth of the edge corresponds to an absorption column of @xmath32 .",
    "this large column density may suggest an fe abundance well above the solar value .",
    "if this is the case , the observed ew could be explained by transmission processes alone .",
    "finally note that cases where a strong fe line is detected although there is no strong evidence for a reflection component are not uncommon ( eg gilli et al 2000 , reynolds et al 1995 ) .",
    "the power - law photon index has a rather flat value of @xmath33 while it remains constant in the two _ bepposax _ observations .",
    "the value of the photon index is in agreement with previous observations ( guainazzi et al 1998 , ryde et al 1997 ) who found a photon index of @xmath34 .",
    "however , it is clearly flatter than that found in @xmath5 ( turner et al 1989 ) and @xmath24 ( smith & done 1996 ) ( @xmath35 ) . therefore the above may be suggesting long term spectral variability ( ryde et al . 1997 ) .",
    "for example , assuming that the x - ray emission comes from comptonization of uv photons from an accretion disk on a hot electron corona ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , a steepening of the spectral index may be attributed to a change of the temperature or the optical depth of the corona .",
    "of course it is difficult to make a detailed comparison due to differences in the energy bandpass of the various instruments as well as in the spectral analysis : for example the addition of a reflection component would result in the steepening of the spectral index .",
    "however , we note that there is no correlation between the flux level and the photon index observed in the case of the ngc7172 observations in the past 20 years .",
    "finally we note that despite the flat photon index found above , our data do not significantly support the existence of any reflection continuum . a recent analysis of @xmath36 monitoring observations of ngc 7172 ( georgantopoulos & papadakis 2000 ) again shows no evidence for reflection component .",
    "the spectral analysis of the two observations of eso103-g35 implies that a simple power - law model absorbed by a column density of n@xmath37 plus a gaussian line at 6.4 kev provides a good fit to our data .",
    "_ exosat _ observations of eso103-g35 ( warwick et al . 1988 ) reveal a 50 per cent decrease in the column density over a 90 day period .",
    "this variation was interpreted in terms of an x - ray absorbing screen composed of broad - line clouds moving around the x - ray source .",
    "alternatively , the n@xmath38 variation could be attributed to photoionization of the neutral column as the flux increases ; in this case an ionized fe edge should be detected .",
    "however , in our analysis we detect no variation of the column within the errors . an fe line at 6.4 kev is strongly needed to fit our data .",
    "unfortunately , the width of the line remains unconstrained .",
    "however , _ asca _",
    "sis observations with better spectral resolution have probably resolved the line into three components at 6.4 , 6.68 and 6.96 kev ( turner et al 1997 ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations ( leahy & creighton 1993 ) show that a column density of n@xmath37 could produce an fe line ew of @xmath13170 ev .",
    "however , in the case of eso 103-g35 where the line originates possibly far away from the central region , the ew varies accordingly to the variations of the continuum .",
    "although a comparison is not straightforward , it is possible that a large fraction of the line emission could originate from transmission processes .    some residuals around 7.5 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ eso103 ] ) may indicate the presence of an absorption edge due to ionized fe .",
    "this was first suggested by @xmath24 results ( warwick et al .",
    "1993 ) and was confirmed later with @xmath11 observations ( forster et al 1999 ) .",
    "the power - law photon index has a steep value of @xmath39 which is consistent with the typical value 1.9 for seyfert galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "despite our large energy bandpass we do not find strong evidence for a reflection continuum in contrast to previous @xmath24 ( smith & done 1996 ) and @xmath36 ( georgantopoulos & papadakis 2000 ) observations who found evidence for such a component but in a smaller band ( 3 - 20 kev ) .",
    "higher signal to noise observations are necessary in order to test the presence of such a component .",
    "previous studies of spectral variability in seyfert-2 galaxies have shown some interesting results .",
    "in particular , iwasawa et al ( 1994 ) and griffiths et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analyzed non - simultaneous _ ginga _ , _ asca _ , _ rosat _ and _ bbxrt _ observations to investigate the spectrum of the seyfert-2 galaxy mrk 3 .",
    "their analysis demonstrated that the fe line does show some variability on time - scales of a few years .",
    "systematic monitoring observation became feasible with the _ rxte _ mission .",
    "in particular , georgantopoulos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , georgantopoulos & papadakis ( 2000 ) , smith , georgantopoulos & warwick ( 2000 ) present monitoring observations of several seyfert-2 galaxies ( mrk3 , eso 103-g35,ic 5063 , ngc 4507 , ngc 7172 & mrk 348 ) spanning time periods from about seven days to seven months . in most cases , they detect spectral variability in the sense that the column density decreases with increasing flux . however , they find no evidence for fe line variability . here instead , we find tentative evidence for line variability in ngc 7172 in a period of one year confirming previous _ asca _ results ( guainazzi et al 1998 ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is one of the very few examples of fe line variability in seyfert-2 galaxies .",
    "our finding requires at least one of the line emitting regions has dimension not much more than about a light year .",
    "it would seem more likely that this scale size corresponds to an accretion disk or inner cloud structure rather than the inner extent of the putative molecular torus .",
    "indeed , the molecular torus is probably a much greater structure .",
    "at least in the case of ngc 1068 observations of molecular hydrogen ( tacconi et al 1994 ) showed that the obscuring torus is located between 30 and 300 pc .",
    "we have analyzed four _ bepposax _ observations of ngc7172 and eso103-g35 ( two observations for each galaxy separated by about a year ) .",
    "the goal was to search for spectral variability in a large energy band and therefore to attempt to constrain the geometry of the circumnuclear matter in these two galaxies .",
    "the spectra of both galaxies are fitted by an absorbed power - law plus a neutral fe line in agreement with previous and observations .",
    "a neutral fe edge is probably detected in the 1996 observation of ngc7172 .",
    "our data do not require a reflection component at a statistically significant level .",
    "we detected flux variability in both objects by about a factor of about two .",
    "we find no significant evidence for spectral variability in the sense that the power - law spectral index and the column density have remained constant in both galaxies implying a homogeneous obscuring screen and constant physical conditions in the accretion disk corona despite the continuum flux variations ( but see warwick et al .",
    "1988 , georgantopoulos & papadakis 2000 ) .",
    "however , in the case of ngc7172 we detect a variation of the fe line flux by a factor of two following the power - law flux , confirming previous results .",
    "this provides strong support to a scenario where the fe line at least in the case of ngc7172 originates in a region close to the nucleus .",
    "these findings support the idea that one region responsible for the line emission should lie within one light year away from the nucleus .",
    "this region may be associated with the outer part of an accretion disk .",
    "the above results clearly emphasize the strength of monitoring observations in probing the geometry of the central engine in agn .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic observations with gratings with both chandra and xmm are expected to revolutionize our knowledge of the physical conditions of the circumnuclear matter in agn .",
    "these combined with future monitoring observations with large effective area instruments such as epic on - board xmm are expected to provide for the first time a detailed mapping of the central regions in agn .",
