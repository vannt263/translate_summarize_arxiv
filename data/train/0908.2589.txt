    "the recent surprise at the tevatron came from the forward - backward asymmetry in top quark pair production . while the standard model ( sm ) only predicts a level as small as a few percent arising from the higher - loop contributions , the measurement by cdf @xcite , however , is as large as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the production angle of the top quark @xmath4 in the @xmath5 rest frame .",
    "the measurement in the @xmath6 laboratory frame is correspondingly smaller , because of the lorentz boost ( washout ) of the partons along the beam axis .",
    "the details for event reconstruction of the @xmath5 pair was given in the cdf paper @xcite .",
    "earlier measurement of the asymmetry with similar result was also reported by d@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if the asymmetry is true , it will indicate the presence of new physics , because within the sm the asymmetry is only up to about 5% @xcite .",
    "so far , a few explanations @xcite have been put forward to account for such a large asymmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an extra @xmath8 boson with a flavor - changing coupling @xmath9 between the top and up quarks was proposed .",
    "thus , the @xmath10 initial state turns into the @xmath11 final state via a @xmath4-channel @xmath8 boson exchange . since the @xmath12 quark most of the times comes from the proton , the produced top quark prefers to go into the forward beam direction defined by the proton .",
    "the production angle @xmath3 in the @xmath11 rest frame is related to the rapidity of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 in the @xmath6 frame by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the square of the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath11 pair .",
    "therefore , the difference between the rapidities of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 in the @xmath6 frame is a close measure of the production angle in the @xmath11 frame .",
    "moreover , the sign of @xmath16 is the same as @xmath17 , such that the asymmetry in eq .",
    "( [ asy ] ) can be given by @xmath18 our parton level calculation uses this definition to calculate the asymmetry .    in this work , we propose an extra @xmath19-like boson @xmath1 that only couples to the @xmath20 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 initial state turns into the @xmath11 final state via a charge - current exchange of the @xmath1 boson in the @xmath4-channel . this process can be used to produce the forward - backward asymmetry as reported by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "note that in the @xmath22 collision , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the forward - backward asymmetry is lost because of the symmetric initial state set up .",
    "the tevatron is therefore a unique place to measure the forward - backward asymmetry for the top quark pair production .",
    "the organization of this letter is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give the formulas for the process that we consider . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the numerical result . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss our result and other possibilities that can provide such a large asymmetry .",
    "suppose the interaction vertex for the @xmath1 boson with the down and top quarks is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the chirality projection operators , @xmath25 are the chiral couplings of the @xmath1 boson with fermions , and @xmath26 is the coupling constant .",
    "the process @xmath27 is described by two feynman diagrams , one @xmath28-channel diagram from the one gluon exchange and one @xmath4-channel diagram from the @xmath1 exchange . ignoring the @xmath20 quark mass , the spin- and color - summed amplitude squared is given by @xmath29   \\label{5 } \\\\ & + & \\frac{16 g_s^4}{\\hat s^2 } \\ , \\left ( u_t^2 + t_t^2 + 2 \\hat s m_t^2 \\right )   +   \\frac{16 g'^2 g_s^2 } { \\hat s \\ , t_{w ' } } ( g_l^2 + g_r^2 ) \\ ,           \\left [ 2 u_t^2 + 2 \\hat s m_t^2         + \\frac{m_t^2}{m_{w'}^2 } ( t_t^2 + \\hat s m_t^2 ) \\right ] \\ ,    \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 . the initial spin- and color - averaged amplitude squared is given by @xmath35 the differential cross section versus the cosine of the production angle @xmath3 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the cross section for the subprocess which is then folded with the parton distribution functions to obtain the measured cross section .",
    "the asymmetry is obtained by integrating over the positive and negative range of the @xmath17 variable . in the calculation",
    ", we used @xmath16 to calculate the asymmetry as given by eqs.([yt - costheta ] ) and ( [ asy - yt ] ) .",
    "the contours of the forward - backward asymmetry are plotted in figs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the first case is the vector - like @xmath1 , while the second case is a pure right - handed @xmath1 .",
    "the latter case could be a variation of certain left - right symmetric model with a twisted family pattern that @xmath40 matches @xmath41 .",
    "the results for these two cases are similar , because it can be seen in eq.([5 ] ) that the roles of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the same .",
    "the mass of the top quark @xmath44 is taken to be 175 gev , as assumed in the measured top quark cross section @xcite .",
    "an important constraint is the total production cross section of the @xmath11 pair .",
    "the proposed @xmath1 exchange would increase the cross section .",
    "we have used a tree - level calculation multiplied by a @xmath45 factor @xmath46 , such that the tree - level sm cross section matches the nlo result @xcite , which is about @xmath47 pb for @xmath48 gev .",
    "the averaged value for @xmath11 cross section by combining various channels is @xcite @xmath49 where the top quark mass is assumed to be 175 gev .",
    "we show the contour of cross sections in the plane of @xmath50 in the figures .",
    "the two contours correspond to @xmath51 pb ( the central value ) and @xmath52 pb ( @xmath53 value ) .",
    "production in the plane of @xmath54 .",
    "the lines shown are for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the chiral couplings for @xmath57 are @xmath58 .",
    "[ 1],width=480 ]     production in the plane of @xmath54 .",
    "the lines shown are for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the chiral couplings for @xmath57 are @xmath59 .",
    "[ 2],width=480 ]    combining the contours of the asymmetry under the constraint of total cross sections , we arrive at the following conclusions :    1 .   in order to produce a large asymmetry either a small @xmath60 , a large coupling @xmath26 , or both .",
    "a heavier @xmath1 boson requires a larger @xmath26 to produce enough asymmetry .",
    "similar effects are seen in the total cross section .",
    "2 .   the overlapping region in each figure then gives viable parameter space in @xmath54 , which gives a large enough asymmetry without producing too many @xmath11 pairs . in the first case of @xmath38 , a @xmath60 as heavy as @xmath61 gev with @xmath62 is allowed .",
    "heavier @xmath1 is not favorable .",
    "3 .   the second case is doing better in the sense that there are substantial overlapping regions between the two sets of contours .",
    "the mass of @xmath1 can be very heavy as long as @xmath26 is large enough .",
    "therefore , a pure right - handed @xmath1 is a favorable candidate .",
    "4 .   if @xmath63 @xmath11 cross section is allowed , larger parameter space can exist in the first case .",
    "if one also takes into account the asymmetry due to higher order qcd effects , the asymmetry required by new physics can be reduced to about @xmath64 .",
    "larger overlapping regions are allowed .",
    "recently , the @xmath65 invariant mass distribution has also been published by the cdf @xcite .",
    "one can use the @xmath66 invariant mass spectrum to put constraints on @xmath26 and @xmath60 , especially at the largest invariant mass bin as shown in fig .",
    "this is because a heavier @xmath1 gives more deviation for the @xmath5 invariant mass distribution .",
    "however , the constraint obtained in this way correlates well with the one obtained by the total cross section discussed erstwhile , though the last bin of @xmath66 could be stronger .",
    "we also note that some caution must be taken if only the last bin is used .",
    "experimentally , all bins in the differential cross section are correlated with one another , and also how the invariant masses are binned would cause strong bias to the results .",
    "fitting to the whole spectrum would make more sense .",
    "we also noticed that the cdf data are more or less consistently below the sm predictions for @xmath67 gev .",
    "in fact , the same behavior was shown in the figure 4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "invariant mass distribution .",
    "data taken from table iii of @xcite is shown along with the standard model result .",
    "also shown are the results of @xmath68 ( 150 , 0.7 ) , ( 250 , 1.0 ) , ( 400 , 1.4 ) and ( 570 , 2 ) .",
    "each pair of these values are chosen within the @xmath69 range of @xmath70 in fig . [ 2 ] .",
    "[ 3],width=480 ]",
    "we first discuss a few models presented in the literature that can account for the asymmetry .",
    "the flavor - changing @xmath8 scenario considered in ref .",
    "@xcite can be derived in a certain class of non - universal @xmath8 models @xcite .",
    "the extra @xmath71 boson couples to fermions in interaction basis with the same strength , except for the third generation . the deviation from family universality and thus the magnitude of fcnc are characterized by a parameter @xmath72 in the @xmath73 coupling .",
    "the interaction of the up sector is given by @xmath74 where the subscript @xmath75 denotes the interaction basis .",
    "the down sector is diagonal and universal for simplicity . for definiteness , we assume @xmath76 when diagonalizing the up - type yukawa coupling , we rotate the left - handed and right - handed fields by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the lagrangian @xmath79 becomes @xmath80 where the subscript @xmath81 denotes the mass eigenbasis .",
    "the flavor mixing in the left - handed fields is in this case simply related to @xmath82 , because @xmath83 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath84 where we have used the unitarity conditions of @xmath82 .",
    "by choosing @xmath85 we have a zero @xmath86 coupling and reasonably large @xmath87 coupling .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in the top pair production arises in the @xmath88 process with the @xmath8 exchange via the @xmath4-channel .",
    "the formula is similarly given by eq.([5 ] ) , with substitutions @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .      based on certain variants of the standard setup of randall - sundrum ( rs ) extra - dimensional model @xcite ,",
    "the authors in @xcite made use of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) states of gluon with different chiral couplings to the fermions to create the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the main reason for different chiral couplings arises from localizing the left- and right - handed fermions in different locations in the extra dimension .",
    "one may also resort to the first kk gluon ( without kk parity ) or second kk gluon ( with kk parity ) in flat extra dimensions with different left- and right - handed fermion localizations @xcite .      without the @xmath4-channel exchange , the reported forward - backward asymmetry in the top pair production disfavors flavor universal axigluon model as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is a light quark ) , then an axigluon of mass from 600 gev to 1.4 tev can accommodate the data .",
    "for such a light axigluon , the lhc experiments will certainly be able to detect it @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 boson proposed in this work only couples to @xmath20 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "it is unnatural because one normally expect the interaction to be family diagonal or to have larger coupling with the second and third generation fermions .",
    "in fact , the @xmath94 coupling also works but it needs a larger coupling because of the smaller parton luminosity for strange quark .",
    "similarly , the @xmath95 coupling should also work but with a very large coupling .",
    "such large family - diagonal couplings would easily upset existing data , e.g. , @xmath96 meson mixings and @xmath96 radiative decay , unless the @xmath1 is very heavy .",
    "the advantage of @xmath97 coupling is that there are very few existing constraints , except for the top decay into @xmath1 .",
    "the top quark can decay into a @xmath20 quark and a @xmath1 if the @xmath1 is light enough .",
    "certainly , one would have seen it in the top quark decay at the tevatron .",
    "our analysis showed that a heavy @xmath1 works if the corresponding coupling is large enough , especially for the case of a purely right - handed @xmath1 . in this case the @xmath1 is not constrained by present top quark data .    within qcd it was shown that @xcite higher order correction can give an asymmetry of 5% .",
    "if the data is real , then the contribution from new physics is of order 15% .",
    "the qcd correction to this new physics contribution should be very small .",
    "in other words , the excess in asymmetry is a rather robust signature of new physics .",
    "if the @xmath1 is not too heavy , it can be produced in the associated production of the top quark , e.g. , @xmath98 at the lhc .",
    "such a process will have a moderate cross section and the @xmath99 will decay into @xmath100 . unfortunately , the @xmath101 background might be overwhelming .",
    "the @xmath1 can also participate in the gluon-@xmath1 fusion ( similar to the @xmath102 fusion for single - top production ) .",
    "the resulting process is therefore @xmath103 via an intermediate @xmath4-channel @xmath1 .",
    "this process may increase @xmath11 production by a small amount at the lhc .",
    "if the @xmath1 is light enough to be pair produced and only the coupling @xmath104 is allowed , this would also contaminate the @xmath5 + @xmath105 background since both @xmath106 and @xmath99 would decay 100 % into top and anti - top plus light quark jets respectively .",
    "one possible way out of this difficulty is to include the @xmath107 couplings such that @xmath1 would decay into light quark jets as well .",
    "a full analysis of this scenario is interesting but beyond the scope of this work .",
