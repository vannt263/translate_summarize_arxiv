    "the pauli exchange interaction , of fundamental importance for understanding the structure of matter , also underlies spin - dependent atomic collisions @xcite .",
    "spin - exchange collisions in atomic vapors have fueled a wide range of scientific investigations , ranging from enhanced nmr signals and new mri techniques @xcite to nuclear scattering experiments sensitive to the nuclear or nucleon spin structure @xcite .",
    "many of the aforementioned phenomena rely on the spin - exchange transfer of large spin polarizations from one atomic species to another .",
    "we here extend spin exchange into a deeper layer of collective spin degrees of freedom , namely we demonstrate the transfer of quantum spin fluctuations from one atomic species to another , a phenomenon we term spin - noise exchange .",
    "quantum fluctuations and their interspecies transfer are central to emerging technologies of quantum information , like quantum memories using atomic spin or pseudo - spin ensembles @xcite .",
    "spin noise @xcite , in particular , determines the quantum limits to the precision of atomic vapor clocks @xcite and the sensitivity of atomic magnetometers @xcite , the most recent of which utilize several spin species @xcite .",
    "the fundamental understanding of spin - noise exchange could have further repercussions , from noise - energy harvesting in spintronic devices @xcite , to novel spin - dependent phenomena in intergalactic hydrogen gas @xcite .",
    "a similar effect to the one described herein was observed with solid - state nuclear spins @xcite , but the transfer of nuclear spin fluctuations was evoked with externally applied magnetic fields . in our case the transfer is spontaneous and driven by incessant atomic spin - exchange collisions .",
    "spin - exchange collisions are central to optical pumping of atomic vapors @xcite . even without externally manipulating atoms with light , i.e. leaving them in an unpolarized equilibrium state ,",
    "spin - exchange collisions lead to continuous spin fluctuations around the average value of zero .",
    "such spontaneous spin noise has been recently demonstrated @xcite to be a versatile spectroscopic tool in atomic and condensed matter physics . in particular , spin noise in a rubidium vapor",
    "was measured @xcite at a magnetic field of several gauss , allowing the spin - noise resonances of @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb ( occurring approximately in the ratio 3:1 in rubidium of natural abundance ) to be clearly distinguished .",
    "this is so since the respective gyromagnetic ratios are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , whereas the resonance line width was on the order of 10 khz .",
    "the total area under the spectral distribution of spin - noise power is the total spin variance , intuitively expected to be constant , i.e. independent of the magnetic field at which the measurement is performed , or equivalently , independent of where along the frequency axis the two spin resonances are positioned .",
    "we will here demonstrate experimentally and prove theoretically that the total spin - noise power of a two - species spin ensemble , like @xmath0rb -@xmath1rb , exhibits a counter - intuitive dependence on the applied magnetic field .",
    "this is the experimental signature of spin - noise exchange , which is observable when the two atomic species have overlapping spin - noise resonances . for the resonance width in our measurement , of about 1 khz",
    ", this overlap happens at magnetic fields on the order of 1 mg .    in section ii and iii we will describe the experimental measurement and data / error analysis , respectively , while in section iv the observed effect",
    "is explained theoretically based on spin - noise correlations that build up at low magnetic fields due to spin - exchange collisions .",
    "the temperature inferred from the collisional line width of the spin noise resonance was @xmath4 , and it was the corresponding rb density that we used in the theoretical prediction .",
    "the laser power and detuning from the d2 line were 3.3 mw and 43 ghz , respectively , while the pressure - broadened optical linewidth at 100 torr of nitrogen is about 4 ghz .",
    "the magnetic field was set by a computer - controlled switch at either the desired value or a much larger value pushing spin noise out of the detector s bandwidth , enabling a fast subtraction of the background spectrum ( no spin noise ) from the spin - noise spectrum .",
    "the balanced polarimeter output was fed into a spectrum analyzer , and the spectra were averaged at the computer.,width=8 ]    the experimental scheme is shown in fig.[schem ] , and is similar to previous studies of spin noise using a dispersive laser - atom interaction @xcite . an off - resonant laser illuminates a magnetically shielded rubidium vapor cell .",
    "a balanced polarimeter measures the faraday rotation angle fluctuations of an initially linearly polarized and far - detuned laser .",
    "these fluctuations result from the fluctuating transverse spin , simultaneously precessing about a dc magnetic field transverse to the laser propagation direction .",
    "as well known , at high laser detunings @xmath5 the faraday rotation angle scales as @xmath6 @xcite . since the measured rotation signal is proportional to @xmath7 and to the laser power , both the laser wavelength and laser power were monitored and their fluctuations or drifts were less than 1% and hence negligible .    , while the latter were normalized by their average value .",
    "the red solid lines are the theoretical prediction @xmath8 of eq . with no free parameters , but with different ( by 20% ) values of the magnetic gradient as input to the theory.,width=8 ]        typical spin - noise spectra at various magnetic fields are shown in fig.[data]a .",
    "they exhibit two peaks centered at the larmor frequencies of @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb .",
    "the spin - noise spectra at different magnetic fields are integrated , and the total spin - noise power is plotted in fig.[data]b .",
    "interestingly , the total spin - noise power increases at low magnetic fields where the two magnetic resonance lines overlap .",
    "this noise increase is the experimental signature of spin - noise exchange .",
    "a consistency check was done to ensure the experiment s and analysis ability to detect an actual change in spin - noise power . instead of using a cell with rubidium of natural abundance",
    ", we performed the same measurement with two cells placed back - to - back , each enriched by one of the two rubidium isotopes .",
    "in this case there can not be any inter - species spin - noise transfer , and the total spin - noise power is expected to be independent of the magnetic field , which is the case as shown in fig.[data]b .",
    "the integrated spin - noise power ( isnp ) data of fig.[data]b were obtained in the following way .",
    "a time series of the polarimeter output was fed into a differential amplifier , the output of which was acquired by the spectrum analyzer ( sa ) having a measurement bandwidth of 50 khz and a resolution bandwidth of 62.5 hz . the corresponding measurement time is 16 ms .",
    "sequentially , we measured the background by applying a large magnetic field to shift the spin noise way out of the 50 khz bandwidth of the sa ( fig.[analysis]a ) .",
    "the background spectrum was then subtracted from the spin noise spectrum .",
    "a run consists of 100 averages of such subtracted spectra , and a data set consists of the average of 50 runs ( fig.[analysis]b ) .",
    "the offset in the spectra of fig.[analysis]a is determined by photon shot noise ( psn ) , verified by the offset s linear dependence @xcite on laser power , depicted in fig.[analysis]c . as usual in noise - measurements",
    ", we also verified the linear scaling of the total spin - noise power with atom number , shown in fig.[analysis]d .        for every magnetic field we measured three data sets both with the experiment cell and the two back - to - back cells .",
    "the isnp in each set was calculated by fitting the spin - noise spectra with a lorentzian lineshape , taking into account the negative frequency folding for the low - magnetic field spectra .",
    "the results of all sets were then averaged and presented in fig.[data]b .",
    "an example of spin noise data with the fit for a relatively high magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ analysis2]a , whereas figs .",
    "[ analysis2]b and [ analysis2]c show the data and fit for the two lowest magnetic field points . to avoid contamination of the lowest magnetic field data ( @xmath9 mg ) by the 1/f noise tail we start fitting the data at 1.9 khz , as the 1/f noise tail disappears into the psn background at 1.5 khz ( fig .",
    "[ analysis2]d ) .",
    "this fit cut - off overestimates the true isnp and needs to be corrected for . to estimate the correction we produce numerical data with the same signal - to - noise ratio as the real data and",
    "fit them starting from various cut - off frequencies .",
    "the isnp of the numerical data is known , and the extracted fit correction is shown in fig .",
    "[ analysis2]e .    for the higher magnetic fields we both fit the data with lorentzians , and",
    "independently we numerically integrate the data to find isnp .",
    "both methods give perfectly consistent results . with the latter method we also estimate the isnp error from the statistical distribution of the isnps of 50 runs .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the observed phenomenon follows by considering the detailed spin dynamics of a coupled spin ensemble .",
    "the three physical mechanisms driving single - species spin noise are ( i ) damping of the transverse spin , ( ii ) transverse spin fluctuations and ( iii ) larmor precession . processes ( i ) and ( ii ) are both driven by atomic collisions , as also understood by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "they involve ( a ) alkali - alkali spin exchange collisions and ( b ) alkali - alkali and alkali - buffer gas spin destruction collisions .",
    "type-(b ) collisions have a negligible cross - section compared to the spin - exchange cross section @xcite @xmath10 , hence only type-(a ) collisions will be considered . in the coupled double - species system",
    "there is an additional phenomenon : spin exchange collisions between different atoms .",
    "these are a sink of spin coherence for one atom and a source of spin polarization for the other .",
    "all of the above phenomena are compactly described by the coupled bloch equations for the transverse spin polarizations @xmath11 of @xmath0rb ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath1rb ( @xmath13 ) : d_1=dt+d_1[dp1 ] d_2=dt+d_2[dp2 ] where @xmath14 are the larmor frequencies of the two rb isotopes in the magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "similar equations , albeit for different binary mixtures and unrelated to spin - noise , have been used elsewhere @xcite .",
    "spin exchange collisions transfer spin polarization from species @xmath16 to @xmath17 at a rate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the respective number densities and @xmath21 the rms average relative velocity of the colliding atoms",
    ". the transverse spin relaxation rate of atom @xmath16 other than due to spin exchange with different - species atoms is given by @xmath22 and consists of ( i ) spin - exchange with same - species atoms , @xmath23 and ( ii ) magnetic field gradient , @xmath24 . the total spin relaxation rate of atom @xmath16 will then be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . from the fits of the noise peaks , and considering that @xmath27 @xcite it was found that for the 10 cm rubidium cell @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "for the two - cell measurement we found @xmath31 , consistent with the fact that in this case the gradient relaxation is negligible since it scales with the 4@xmath32 power of cell dimension and the isotopic cells were 5 cm long each ) .",
    "there are two small additional relaxation sources common to both atoms : ( i ) the transit time through the probe laser , and ( ii ) probe laser power broadening .",
    "the former can be safely neglected .",
    "the latter is only 5% of the total linewidth .",
    "finally , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are independent gaussian white noise processes with zero mean and variance @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 is the total atom number of species-@xmath16 probed by the laser .      introducing the 2-element column - vector @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ,",
    "the bloch equations ( [ dp1 ] ) and ( [ dp2 ] ) can be compactly written as d =- dt*a*+d[sigma ] where the decay matrix is =(    ccc _ 1+i_1 & -^12_se + -^21_se & _ 2+i_2 +    ) , and @xmath39 is the diagonal @xmath40 fluctuation matrix with @xmath41 and @xmath34 .",
    "the noise vector @xmath42 describes two independent complex gaussian processes , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , having zero mean and variance @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the total spin @xmath46 probed by the laser is the sum of the @xmath47-component of all rubidium atom spins inside the probe laser beam , @xmath48 , which can be written as @xmath49 .",
    "the total spin - noise power @xmath50 as a function of the magnetic field @xmath51 can be computed as @xmath52 since the averaging time @xmath53 is much longer than the spin relaxation time , ergodicity of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ensures that the preceding long time average can be computed as an expectation under its equilibrium distribution . now , is a two - dimensional complex gaussian process .",
    "its equilibrium distribution has mean 0 , while the covariance matrix @xmath54 with @xmath55 $ ] for @xmath56 can be computed ( cf @xcite equation ( 4.4.51 ) ) as the unique self - adjoint solution to the matrix equation @xmath57 solving the system of linear equations we find @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61-{\\gamma_{se}^{12}}{\\gamma_{se}^{21}}}.\\ ] ] hence , @xmath62=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{n}^t\\sigma\\mathbf{n}$ ] , where @xmath63 , and finally we get = 1,[sb ] where = 1 + 4_se^12_se^21(bb_0)^2 .",
    "here we have defined @xmath64 . for our experimental parameters @xmath65 .",
    "equation leads to the theoretical prediction plotted in fig .",
    "2b with no free parameters .",
    "for the ideal case of no magnetic gradient , @xmath66 , the field @xmath67 signifies a transition from a high - field regime @xmath68 where the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath69 of the decay matrix @xmath70 describe two independent spin precessions at @xmath71 and @xmath72 and decaying at a rate @xmath73 , to a low - field regime @xmath74 where the spin - exchange coupling forces the atoms to precess together at @xmath75 ,",
    "the precession having two decay rates @xmath76 @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the lowest field used is just about @xmath67 and this transition of the decay rates @xmath77 is not observable .",
    "further , in the absence of magnetic gradient the spin - noise power at zero field takes on the simple form = r^2 + 4r+1 where @xmath78 .",
    "the excess spin - noise power is maximized for @xmath79 , the maximum being 100% , i.e. the spin - noise power is double at low fields relative to high fields .      towards explaining the observed effect we note that the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix @xmath54 carry information about the correlation of polarizations @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is @xmath82=\\mathbb{e}[\\mathfrak{re}\\{\\pi_1\\pi_2^*\\}]=\\mathfrak{re}\\{\\sigma_{12}\\}$ ] .",
    "we can thus compute the correlation coefficient ( b)=f(b ) [ correl ] again , in the ideal case of no gradient relaxation it is @xmath83 , which is also maximized for @xmath79 with the maximum being 1/2 .",
    "also , @xmath84 when @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to an intuitive explanation of the observed phenomenon as an exchange of spin - noise between two atomic species . in the rotating frame of atom",
    "@xmath17 the transverse spin of atom @xmath16 precesses at the frequency @xmath85 . if @xmath86 , in other words if the two spin noise resonances are far apart , the spin polarization of atom @xmath16 seen in the rotating frame of atom @xmath17 averages out to zero within the spin - exchange time of @xmath87 .",
    "if , however , @xmath88 , then the noise polarization of atom @xmath16 transferred to @xmath17 adds up , to some extent coherently due to the non - zero @xmath89 , to the noise polarization of @xmath17 .",
    "this is due to the strong polarization - noise correlations produced by spin - exchange .",
    "hence the total spin - noise power is increased relative to the case where the two noise powers add just in quadrature for @xmath86 .    to quantify the above discussion ,",
    "let @xmath90 be the total _ power _ of atom-@xmath17 polarization fluctuations .",
    "we can think of @xmath91 as consisting of two terms , the noise power @xmath92 that we would observe if atoms-@xmath17 were alone , and the transfer of polarization noise from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , described by the term @xmath93 . clearly , @xmath94 . in view of ( [ sdiag ] )",

    "two @xmath0rb atoms in the @xmath97 state and opposite @xmath98 collide , and after the collision one jumps to the @xmath99 manifold .",
    "the total @xmath98 is conserved , however the spin in the @xmath99 state precesses in the opposite sense . under the action of the magnetic field",
    "@xmath100 the two atoms will momentarily generate a non - zero contribution to the spin - noise signal along the y - axis ( balanced of course by the nuclear spins ) .",
    "subsequent spin - exchange collisions will damp the transverse spin and so on and forth . , width=7 ]      for completeness we note the following .",
    "( i ) in the two hyperfine levels of rubidium the spin precesses in opposite directions , corresponding to positive and negative frequencies . in the measured power spectrum",
    "both appear at the same positive frequency .",
    "( ii ) spin noise is genuine quantum noise produced by atomic collisions .",
    "the linear scaling of the total spin - noise power with atom number ( fig .",
    "[ analysis]d ) does not by itself prove the previous assertion .",
    "instead , the physics of spin - noise generation must be understood .",
    "spin exchange collisions have two roles : they damp spin coherence and they generate noise coherence . as well known @xcite",
    ", atoms can jump from one hyperfine level to the other during a spin - conserving spin - exchange collision , thereby perturbing their coherent spin precession and leading to loss of spin coherence .",
    "the same mechanism can generate fluctuations of spin coherence as shown in the example of fig .",
    "[ col ] . in every collision",
    "there are a number of potential final states , the probability of which is determined by the quantum spin - dependent scattering of the atoms @xcite , and hence spin - noise bears the fundamental quantum - mechanical unpredictability .",
    "( iii ) there is an apparent disagreement between data and theory at intermediate - field data .",
    "the magnetic gradient was found to have a 20% variation with magnetic field . in fig .",
    "2b we plot the theoretical prediction with a constant value for the gradient , but we haven shown how the theoretical prediction is affected by changing this constant value within its observed variation range . either an unidentified systematic or a statistical outlier effect could be responsible for the aforementioned discrepancy . to demonstrate the spin - noise effect presented in this work without the added complication of magnetic gradients and with better statistics a short cell in the multi - pass arrangement of romalis and",
    "co - workers @xcite would be most appropriate .",
    "concluding , we have experimentally demonstrated the interspecies transfer of spin noise through the spin - exchange coupling of two alkali vapors .",
    "this transfer , also seen as a positive correlation of the two - species polarization noise , manifests itself as a total noise power increase at low - magnetic fields , or to put it differently , as the decrease of the total spin - noise power at high fields where the spin - noise correlation vanishes .",
    "although we demonstrated the phenomenon using an unpolarized spin state , the same phenomenon would occur in the coherent spin state of a maximally polarized spin ensemble @xcite , directly relevant to precision metrology applications .",
