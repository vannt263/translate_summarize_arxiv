    "transition disks may trace a key step in the process of forming planets and dissipating primordial stellar disks .",
    "transition disks are primordial disks characterized by weak mid - ir emission ( at @xmath315 @xmath5 m ) relative to the taurus median spectral energy distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e.  the  median  sed  of  primordial  disks  in  the  young  ( @xmath62  myr )  taurus  star - forming  region ) .",
    "a number of transition disks possess gaps either posited from sed studies or directly imaged @xcite which may be due to clearing of dust by a forming planet or brown dwarf and thus may produce the observed mid - ir deficit .",
    "transition disks have therefore been popular targets for high - contrast high - resolution imaging planet searches .    while transition disks have previously been searched for planets using high contrast imaging techniques ( e.g. adaptive optics and coronagraphy ) , most of these techniques currently do not extend to the inner 0.1  which corresponds to the crucial planet - forming regions ( @xmath310 au ) of the disk for objects at distances @xmath7100 pc .",
    "only interferometric techniques possess the resolution to reveal these inner regions ( see  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the interferometric technique of sparse - aperture masking ( sam ) uniquely allows us to both probe the inner 0.1  of transitional disks and reach high contrasts of @xmath0mag(l ) = 5 - 6.5 mag .",
    "probing this region enables us to understand how planets form in their native disk and how they impact the surrounding material .",
    "indeed , observations using sam have already yielded two planetary or brown dwarf candidate companions to transition disk stars @xcite .",
    "the transition disk star hd 142527 is a herbig fe star with spectral type of f6 iiie @xcite .",
    "hd 142527 notably possesses a very complex and interesting disk that has long been posited as a possible site of planet formation .",
    "recent sed modeling and visir imaging suggests a disk gap from 30 - 130 au @xcite .",
    "the outer edge of the gap as well as a spiral feature in the outer disk have been imaged in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find an offset of 20 au between the star center and disk center , which they posit is caused by an unseen eccentric binary companion .",
    "@xcite note this system as a possible ( but unconfirmed ) binary detection from spectro - astrometry .",
    "the disk of hd 142527 also possesses an extremely high fraction of crystalline silicates , possibly formed by a massive companion inducing spiral density waves in the disk material @xcite . here",
    "we report the discovery of a likely close - in , low - mass stellar companion ( 12.8@xmath11.5  au at 145 pc and flux ratios in h , k , and l of 0.016@xmath10.007 , 0.012@xmath10.008 , and 0.0086@xmath10.0011 respectively ) to this star .",
    "this is the first confirmation of the binarity of hd 142527 and may provide a critical explanation of the observed disk structure .",
    "hipparcos measurements for hd 142527 yield a distance of 230@xmath8 pc @xcite .",
    "alternately , hd 142527 has been associated with both the sco ob-2 association @xcite and upper centaurus lupus @xcite .",
    "membership in either association ( indeed the two both are part of the larger sco - cen association ) place hd 142527 at a distance of 140 - 145 pc @xcite and an age of 2 - 10 myr .",
    "we consider the evidence of association within sco - cen to be very strong and thus adopt a distance of 145@xmath115 pc , which still lies within 2-@xmath2 of the rather uncertain hipparcos measurement .",
    "@xcite obtain a stellar luminosity of 15@xmath12 l@xmath4 from comparison to @xcite photospheric models for the object spectral type of f6 iii .",
    "they correct the stellar luminosity to 20@xmath12 l@xmath4 after taking into account a model - dependent grey extinction component of the disk and halo and obtain updated stellar parameters by comparing the position of this star in the hertzsprung - russell diagram to the pms evolution tracks of @xcite . here , we adopt the stellar parameters from @xcite  specifically , a stellar mass of 2.2@xmath10.3 m@xmath4 and an age of 5@xmath9 myr consistent with membership in the sco ob-2 association ( table  [ tab : photom ] ) .",
    "hd 142527 was observed on 10 march 2012 with vlt naco .",
    "observations were taken in the h , k , and l bands ( @xmath10= 3.80 @xmath1 0.31 @xmath5 m ) using the `` 7 holes '' aperture mask and the ir wavefront sensor ( wfs ) .",
    "the observing log is presented in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the target was observed in each band for 30 min to 2 hrs .",
    "the use of the `` 7 holes '' ( c7 - 892 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aperture mask transforms the telescope into a fizeau interferometer .",
    "the point spread function is a complex superposition of fringes at given spatial frequencies . in specific cases ,",
    "pupil - masking can outperform more traditional differential imaging for a number of reasons @xcite .",
    "first , the masks are designed to have nonredundant array configurations that permit phase deconvolution ; slowly moving optical aberrations not corrected by the ao can be accurately calibrated .",
    "second , the mask primarily rejects baselines with low spatial frequency and passes proportionately far more baselines with higher @xmath11/b ( where b is baseline length ) resolution than does an orthodox fully filled pupil .",
    "third , high - fidelity recovery of phase information allows `` super resolution '' , with a marginal loss of dynamic range up to @xmath11/2d ( where d is the mirror diameter ) .",
    "the principal drawback is a loss in throughput so that photon and detector noise can affect the signal - to - noise ratio even where targets are reasonably bright for the ao system .",
    "the effective field - of - view of sam is determined by the shortest baseline so that the technique is not competitive at separations that are greater than several times the formal diffraction limit . for sam observations with the `` 7 holes '' mask with vlt naco , the field - of - view is 300 mas in h band , 400 mas in k band , and 600 mas in l band . for more details on the sam mode",
    ", please see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the hd 142527 observations were processed with both the sydney fft and observatoire de paris samp pipelines @xcite .",
    "both the @xmath12 map and the phase in the uv plane ( extracted  from  the  closure phases ,  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show an asymmetry typical of point sources ( at the resolution of the telescope , see left panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , we fitted the closure phases with a model of two point - like objects ( the star and a companion of lesser flux ) . in all three bands ,",
    "the best fit model to the closure phases shows a point - like asymmetry at 88@xmath15 mas from the central star with flux ratios in h , k , and l of 0.016@xmath10.007 , 0.012@xmath10.008 , 0.0086@xmath10.0011 respectively ( 3-@xmath2 errors ) relative to the primary star and disk .",
    "the @xmath12 map of the l band data is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the fit on several of the 35 closure phases triangle is plotted in fig .",
    "2 ( l band data ) .",
    "we adopt the hkl magnitudes from @xcite , since no l band data is available from 2mass .",
    "we note , however , that there is a significant divergence between the reported 2mass photometry and the @xcite photometry .",
    "the 2mass photometry is brighter than the @xcite photometry by 0.1 - 0.3 mag , which may suggest variability for this system .",
    "no errors are provided for the @xcite photometry ; we assume error bars are similar to the 2mass photometry .    raw photometry for this system",
    "is comprised of light from three components  primary star , secondary companion , and disk .",
    "some portion of the disk ( the `` outer disk '' ) lies outside of the sam field of view . from the sed model of @xcite",
    "we estimate that the outer disk comprises @xmath310@xmath13 or less of the total system flux at hkl. thus , we do not correct the raw photometry to remove the outer disk component . magnitudes in h , k , and l for the star+disk are presented in table  [ tab : photom ] .",
    "the detected companion has flux ratios in h , k , and l of 0.016@xmath10.007 , 0.012@xmath10.008 , 0.0086@xmath10.0011 respectively ( 3-@xmath2 errors ) . to account for errors in the initial photometry as well as our measured sam flux ratio ,",
    "we adopt a monte carlo approach .",
    "we simulated an ensemble of 10@xmath14 observations per band , with photometry and flux ratios drawn from gaussian distributions centered on the measured values and with @xmath2 drawn from the reported errors .",
    "the apparent magnitude in each band is given as the median of this ensemble , with error bars drawn from the standard deviation of the same ensemble .",
    "the measured flux ratios and primary star photometry correspond to apparent magnitudes of 10.5@xmath10.2 , 10.0@xmath10.3 , 9.1@xmath10.1 in hkl ( table  [ tab : photom ] ,  in  cit  bandpasses , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the companion appears anomalously bright in l. while the h - k color are similar to what would be expected for a young red companion , k - l @xmath30.9 mag , diverging significantly from the expected value of @xmath30.4 mag @xcite .",
    "companion fluxes in these bandpasses , along with the full sed for the system are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "we employed a similar monte carlo approach in converting from apparent to absolute magnitudes . for our ensemble of 10@xmath14 simulated objects",
    ", we simulate corresponding distances drawn from a gaussian centered at 145 pc and with @xmath2 of 15 pc .",
    "absolute magnitudes are also reported in table  [ tab : photom ] .",
    "we estimated the likelihood that this companion is an unrelated background or foreground object using source counts from the 2mass survey . within a 1 degree radius of the primary ,",
    "2mass detects 1918 objects with h of 10.7 mag or brighter and 1505 objects with ks of 10.0 mag or brighter .",
    "thus , adopting the approach of @xcite , in particular , their equation 1 , we estimate the probability of finding an unrelated source at least as bright as the observed companion within 0.088of the primary to be @xmath31.1@xmath1510@xmath16 in h band and @xmath38.3@xmath1510@xmath17 in ks .",
    "we also considered simulated stellar populations along this line of sight ( galactic latitude and longitude of 335.6549@xmath18 , + 08.4804@xmath18 ) using the besanon galactic population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "this line of sight is directly into the galactic bulge , so the models yield 882 background sources per square degree brighter than k=10.5 mag .",
    "however , the chances of finding one of these within 0.088  of the primary are still vanishingly small ",
    "@xmath31.6@xmath1510@xmath16  and these objects are predominantly m giant stars , with considerably bluer expected colors ( for  a  m5iii  star ,  h - k  =  0.29  mag  and  k - l  =  0.22 mag , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than measured for the detected companion .",
    "it is therefore extraordinarily unlikely that the companion is unrelated to the primary , although proper motion confirmation in a year will be necessary to finally determine this .",
    "estimated masses for both system components are highly dependent on adopted age .",
    "certainly the hd 142527 system is quite young , but whether it is 1 myr or 10 myr makes a critical difference in the mass estimate for the faint companion . here , we adopt a similar age range as @xcite , which is dependent on membership in the sco ob-2 association .",
    "we again adopt monte carlo methods to account for the range of possible ages for this system .",
    "an ensemble of 10@xmath14 possible ages are drawn from a gaussian in log space , centered on log(age ) = 6.7 and with @xmath2(log(age ) ) = 0.4 .",
    "we then interpolate with age and single band absolute magnitude to find the best mass for the companion from the models of @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass distributions are presented as histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshist ] .",
    "it is apparent that the mass estimate for the companion is not well constrained at these ages but is most likely to lie in the range from 0.1 - 0.4 m@xmath4 .",
    "we estimate a best mass estimate for each band of 0.28@xmath10.15 m@xmath4 , 0.34@xmath10.19 m@xmath4 , and 0.60@xmath10.29 m@xmath4 in hkl respectively . however , the mass distributions from our monte carlo simulations are highly non - gaussian with significant probability to find considerably higher companion masses .",
    "all mass estimates are within 2-@xmath2 of each other , but the l band mass estimate is particularly high and we note that the companion appears anomalously bright in l. while the h - k colors are similar to what would be expected for a young red companion , k - l @xmath30.9 mag , considerably divergent from the expected value of 0.4 mag . we thus do not attempt to estimate spectral type using h - k and k - l colors .",
    "the models of @xcite yield a similar mass range for the companion of 0.1 - 0.4 m@xmath4 for ages of 2 - 12 myr .",
    "the models themselves are highly dependent on age ; to illustrate this , we plot isomass contours ( from  the  models  of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a function of absolute h magnitude and age in fig .",
    "[ fig : masshist ] .",
    "we estimate the semimajor axis of hd 142527b s orbit from its observed separation .",
    "assuming a uniform eccentricity distribution between 0 @xmath6 e @xmath6 1 and random viewing angles , @xcite compute a median correction factor between projected separation and semimajor axis of 1.10@xmath19 ( 68.3% confidence limits ) . using this , we derive a semimajor axis of 14@xmath20 au .",
    "while the mass estimate for the companion is quite uncertain , we adopt the k band value as characteristic and adopt a total system mass of 2.54@xmath10.35 m@xmath4 .",
    "our derived semi - major axis estimate corresponds to an orbital period estimate of 33@xmath21 years .    after a year",
    ", we expect up to 20 mas of orbital motion on the sky for the companion , which is easily detectable with sam .",
    "the degree of motion observed will put important constraints on the mass of the companion ( after adopting an estimate of the mass of the primary ) and will provide a key datapoint for an eventual dynamical mass determination for this system . assuming a coverage of one third of an orbit is necessary for a good orbital determination @xcite , such a determination may be possible in 10 year timescales for this system .",
    "hd 142527a has a measured proper motion of -11.19@xmath10.93 mas in ra and -24.46@xmath10.79 in dec ",
    "i.e. about @xmath320 mas on - sky motion in a year , with 3-@xmath2 astrometric errors of @xmath35  mas .",
    "thus , we will also be able to completely rule out the extremely unlikely case that the companion is an unrelated background object .",
    "the existence of an inner binary has been predicted for hd 142527 @xcite but this is the first confirmation of the binary companion .",
    "the inner binary likely explains the 20 au offset observed by @xcite between the primary and the disk center @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the inner binary provides an important update for modeling efforts of the structure of the inner disk .",
    "the modeling efforts of @xcite find a flat , dusty inner disk from 0.3 to 30 au ( outer radius supported as well by marginally resolved visir imaging ) , an optically thin halo from 0.3 to 30 au , and an outer disk starting at 130 au .",
    "the current projected separation for the companion , @xmath313 au , place it right inside the modeled inner disk !",
    "thus , it is likely that the companion may produce a cleared ring within the inner disk .",
    "models of the physical properties of disks around eccentric stellar binaries often show entirely cleared inner disks @xcite , which may not be the case here .",
    "the hd 142527 disk is notable for being comparably bright or even brighter than the primary star at infrared wavelengths . at h and k bands ,",
    "the star is as bright or brighter than the disk , whereas at l band , the disk is considerably brighter than the star .",
    "we consider all components of the @xcite sed model in deriving photometry for the companion .",
    "however , if a portion of the inner disk does not contribute to the brightness of the central source , this may be the reason that our l band flux measurement for the companion is anomalously bright .",
    "alternatively , the very bright measured l band magnitude may suggest that the secondary has its own small circumstellar disk ( with possible accretion onto the secondary ) or that the relatively massive secondary may produce local disk heating .",
    "transient heating caused by the secondary inducing spiral shock waves in the disk material could also be the source of the high fraction of crystalline sillicates found at large radii in this disk @xcite",
    ".    the large cavity observed in the hd 142527 disk may be the signature of an unseen companion interacting with the inner binary .",
    "a binary + planet system can open a much larger gap than can be formed by the binary by itself @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that in the case of an eccentric inner binary system , the circumbinary disk itself can become eccentric , ending the inner migration of the planet and producing a stable orbital configuration .",
    "this seems a likely explanation of the observed disk structure in the hd 142527 system , especially the wide gap within 130 au , but must be confirmed by continued orbital monitoring of the binary system to confirm that it is indeed in an eccentric orbit .",
    "followup sam observations are thus absolutely critical for this system and are still possible within the lifespan of naco .",
    "eventually , a dynamical mass can be determined for this system , perhaps in 10 year timescales and monitoring on 1 - 2 year timescales may help confirm the eccentricity of the orbit ( see  e.g. * ? ? ? * for  a  similar  example ) .",
    "we detect a likely close companion to hd 142527 with separation of 88@xmath15 mas ( 12.8@xmath11.5  au at 145 pc ) and flux ratios in h , k , and l of 0.016@xmath10.007 , 0.012@xmath10.008 , 0.0086@xmath10.0011 respectively ( 3-@xmath2 errors ) relative to the primary star and inner disk .",
    "the companion is consistent with mass estimates of 0.1 - 0.4 m@xmath4 from the models of @xcite .",
    "however , continued orbital monitoring will be necessary to provide more accurate mass estimates , as model masses contain significant uncertainties at these young ages . the inner binary",
    "likely explains the 20 au offset observed by @xcite between the primary and the disk center @xcite .",
    "additionally , the large cavity observed in the hd 142527 may be the signature of an unseen planet interacting with the inner binary .",
