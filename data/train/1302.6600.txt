    ", this impressive growth will continue in the new millennia as the work on few notable 20 - 40 m class giant telescope projects is already in progress @xcite .",
    "the evolution of solar telescope , on the other hand , has followed a different trajectory @xcite .",
    "the immense difficulty in managing the thermal loads and internal seeing caused by radiative flux has been the major hurdles in building large solar telescopes .",
    "the technology has now advanced to a stage where building large aperture solar telescopes is well within the reach .",
    "efforts from various groups are now underway to build next generation 2 - 4 m class solar telescopes .",
    "some notable solar facilities that are currently in different phases of development include : a 4 m advanced technology solar telescope ( atst ) to be build by the national solar observatory , usa @xcite .",
    "the 4 m european solar telescope ( est ) , under considerations from european association for solar telescopes @xcite . a 2 m class national large solar telescope ( nlst ) proposed by the indian institute of astrophysics , india @xcite .",
    "these telescopes will be equipped with adaptive optics and other state - of - the - art scientific instruments to facilitate diffraction - limited observations of the small scale features ( @xmath050 km ) of the solar atmosphere . meanwhile",
    ", the 1.6 m new solar telescope ( nst ) at big bear solar observatory , usa and the 1.5 m gregor telescope built by a consortia led kiepenheuer - institute , germany , have started providing high quality ground based observations of the sun@xcite .",
    "evidently , one of the most challenging tasks is to carefully handle the excessive heat generated by large radiation flux incident on the primary mirror . equally important",
    "is the choice of high quality , thermally stable and rigid material capable of maintaining the optical figure over a specified range of observing conditions .",
    "the thermal response of the solar mirror is influenced by radiative heating of the mirror caused by direct light absorption and the temperature imbalance with the surroundings .",
    "mirror heating adversely affects the final image quality of the telescope in two ways , as is explained below .",
    "first and foremost , it is hard for a massive mirror having large heat capacity and high thermal resistance to attain a temperature balance with the surrounding air . under such conditions , the temperature difference between the mirror surface and the ambient air leads to refractive index fluctuations along the beam path .",
    "this ` mirror seeing ' produces wavefront aberrations responsible for the image blurring . to preserve the image quality of the telescope",
    ", the effect of mirror seeing has to be minimized .",
    "this means the temperature difference between the mirror surface and the ambient air should not exceed beyond @xmath1  c @xcite .",
    "more crucially , the temperature uniformity across the mirror surface has to be maintained within @xmath2  c. several approaches which include , air conditioning @xcite , fanning the optical surface @xcite , ventilating mirror interior , resistive heating @xcite have been proposed to regulate the mirror temperature for ensuring high quality astronomical observations .",
    "laminar air flow across the mirror homogenizes the temperature by disintegrating the ` thermal plumes ' closer to the surface .",
    "these methods also speed up the thermalisation process by improving the convective heat transfer rate between the substrate and the surrounding air .",
    "secondly , a poorly conducting mirror is differentially heated to create temperature inhomogeneities within the substrate volume . thermally induced material expansion or contraction",
    "can significantly alters the optical quality of the telescope mirror .",
    "this problem can be eliminated by choosing mirror substrates made of ultra low expansion ( ule ) material .",
    "in fact , the demand for high quality astronomical optics has led to the development of many attractive low expansion materials such as zerodur ( schott ) , fused quartz , cervit , ule ( corning ) , clearceram ( ohara ) and astro - sitall etc .",
    "these ule materials usually have high heat capacity and low thermal conductivity , implying they can retain a significant amount of heat , leaving the mirror prone to undesirable seeing effects and surface buckling under high thermal loads .",
    "the severity of mirror heating problem scales adversely with the aperture size . to reduce the overall weight and large thermal inertia",
    ", the most preferred choice is to use lightweighted mirror structures that are easy to mount and do not deform significantly under gravity .",
    "besides , the reduced mass also facilitates efficient and faster cooling of the mirror in harsh thermal conditions . for space applications , reducing the weight of the mirror has greater premium on the overall cost reduction of the payload .",
    "the lightweight geometry is created by removing pockets of material from the blank without significantly compromising the rigidity and stiffness of the mirror @xcite .",
    "the extreme lightweighting is usually achieved by mechanical milling and acid etching .",
    "the cool air , circulated through the rear pockets can remove the excessive heat from the mirror very efficiently .",
    "the pocketed cell geometry introduces structural inhomogeneities within the mirror blank .",
    "the top faceplate ( reflecting surface ) of the mirror gets the mechanical support from the grid of discrete ribs .",
    "the effect of underlying geometry of the cellular structure usually manifests in the form of rib print - through patterns a ) during the mechanical polishing of the faceplate and b ) periodic temperature residuals on the mirror faceplate operating in extreme thermal conditions . while polishing , the lapping tool experiences greater reaction force from the rib locations to wear out more materials thus creating periodic thickness variations on the faceplate .",
    "the wavefront errors related to polishing print - through are well studied and there are ways to mitigate them @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have examined the impact of relatively less explored but nonetheless important ` thermal print - through ' issue associated with the lightweighted structure operating in thermally dynamic environment .",
    "the thermo - optic analysis , as it is increasingly recognized , is a vital component of the overall system design and necessary to predict and verify the satisfactory performance of the mirror @xcite . here ,",
    "we have used fea to solve the time dependent 3-d heat transfer equation to predict the mirror deformation arising from the thermally induced stress and temperature inhomogeneities of a lightweighted structure . for realistic numerical simulations , the location dependent solar flux and ambient heating model",
    "is incorporated into fea analysis .",
    "thermal response of three types of mirror materials is studied at varying ambient temperature conditions that may exist at various observatory locations .",
    "temperature induced surface deformations were analyzed using zernike polynomials . for optical analysis",
    ", the zernike data was imported into zemax -a ray tracing software .",
    "a comparative study is carried out for three well accepted substrate materials in astronomical optics , namely , zerodur , pyrex and sic .",
    "in order to study the primary mirror heating and the associated thermal stress / strain fields affecting the surface figure , each physical process should be identified . in the following we give a brief mathematical formulation of the heat transfer problem along with appropriate prescription for boundary and initial conditions .      in a simplified form",
    ", the telescope mirror can be considered as a 3d circular disk whose front face is exposed to intense solar irradiance @xmath3 .",
    "the thin metallic coating on the faceplate absorbs about 10%15% of radiant flux which is converted into heat .",
    "the temperature distribution inside the mirror changes as the heat conducts from front surface to the rear side .",
    "the mirror also exchanges heat ( via convection and radiation ) with ambient air , which is at a temperature @xmath4 .",
    "a heat transfer equation can be derived based on the principle of conservation of energy , solution of which gives the temperature distribution @xmath5 . the 2nd order partial differential equation relevant to the current studies for the conductive heat transfer in a solid",

    "the resulting structure has side walls / ribs of certain thickness that supports the thin reflecting faceplate of the mirror from behind .",
    "besides the mechanical support , the rib walls also provide the thermal flow path for heat to conduct away from the faceplate .",

    "the solitary presence of @xmath87 and its harmonics can be associated with the shape of thermal print - through errors arising from the 6-fold symmetry of the hexagonal pockets .",
    "it is to be noted that amplitude of these terms ( see fig.7(b ) ) , does not decline appreciably with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that using more number of zernike terms is unlikely to improve the fitting accuracy of the sag data further .",
    "one reason for such behavior is the limited ability of the zernike polynomials to capture high - frequency surface imperfections as oppose to their effectiveness in capturing low - frequency global changes in the surface shape .",
    "that is why in zernike representation , the impact of high frequency thermal print - through on surface sag is likely to be swamped by low - order figure changes induced by defocus and all spherical terms . in order to effectively visualize small - scale surface elevations , we computed residual sag by extracting the zernike reconstructed surface from the original sag data .",

    "a simple telescope design was created in zemax as shown in fig .",
    "the design conforms to optical prescription of m1 given in section 3 .",
    "the aberration data can be incorporated into the optical model of the telescope by assigning a suitable surface type the _ zernike standard sag _ , to the m1 in zemax .",
    "this surface type is commonly used for describing mechanical deformations . selecting _",
    "zernike standard sag _ surface allows user to define the standard surface ( e.g. plane , spheres , conics etc ) plus additional zernike terms that can be imposed on the standard surface to represent surface aberrations @xcite .",
    "the aberration data for m1 along with number of zernike terms , normalized radius of the aperture and a list of externally computed zernike coefficients was directly imported into zemax using extra data editor .",
    "the m2 was assumed to be free from any surface irregularity .    in zemax",
    ", there are many ways to assess the optical performance of the system .",
    "we used spot diagrams and modulation transfer function to evaluate the performance of the telescope system .",
    "the thermal distortions are assumed to become worse when the mirror temperature reaches its maximum at @xmath89 hrs .",
    "for the worst case scenario , the effect of thermally induced aberrations on the telescope image quality can be readily seen in the spot diagram shown in fig .  10 . except for zerodur material , the rms spot radius ( figs .",
    "10(a)-10(c ) ) for pyrex and sic is significantly larger than the size of the airy disc , implying the diffraction limited performance of m1 made of high cte materials , is severely compromised by thermal heating . the contribution of low amplitude zernike terms ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) is estimated by setting the radial terms ( fig .",
    "7(a ) ) to zero in zemax .",
    "clearly , the low amplitude terms add significant scatter to the energy distribution as shown in figs .",
    "10(d)-10(f ) .",
    "the envelop of the spot scatter is also indicative of the periodicity and shape of the ` surface bumps ' caused by uneven temperature distribution resulting from underlying hex - cell structure of the m1 .",

    "the variation of contrast , i.e. , mtf for pyrex and sic is plotted in figs .",
    "11(a ) and 11(b ) , respectively . considering the severity of the thermal distortions , a steep fall in contrast at relatively low - frequencies",
    "is not completely unexpected .",
    "the preceding studies were also repeated for convective heat transfer coefficient @xmath90  w / m@xmath32 .",
    "the corresponding rms spot radii for the zerodur , pyrex and sic were found to be @xmath91 m , @xmath92 m and @xmath93 m .",
    "this is only a moderate improvement .",
    "this shows that forced circulation of ambient air alone in high cte materials ( pyrex and sic ) is not enough to keep the thermal distortions within tolerable limits . for effective thermal control ,",
    "the temperature of the circulated air has to regulated few degrees below the ambient temperature .",
    "a detailed cfd analysis is however needed to arrive at the optimal coolant air temperature that would minimize the mirror seeing and thermal distortions of the m1 .",
    "the numerical studies presented in this paper would complement those efforts .",
    "finally , we draw the attention of the scientific community to consider the present scheme of opto - thermal analysis for optimization of the solar telescope design .",
    "field angle ( a ) for pyrex and ( b ) for the sic mirror . for zerodur (",
    "not shown ) , the ray aberrations are well within the diffraction limits and three mtf curves would overlap.,width=359 ]",
    "the temperature stabilization of a primary mirror system is one of the most challenging tasks in building a large aperture solar telescope . to achieve the desired optical performance of the telescope , the thermal response of the primary mirror needs to be accurately predicted and suitably controlled under the harsh observing conditions . for large aperture telescope ,",
    "the lightweighted mirror offer significant advantages over traditionally used solid blanks .",
    "however , the pocketed cell structure created by the lightweighting process leads to geometry dependent material inhomogeneities and non - uniform temperature patterns .",
    "besides providing physical support to the faceplate , the rib walls of the lightweighted structure also serve as discrete channels for the heat flow , giving rise to periodic thermal print - through errors across the mirror surface .",
    "we carried of a detailed thermo - optic analysis of a 2 m class solar telescope mirror .",
    "a time dependent heat transfer and structural model of the lightweighted mirror was solved using fea methods .",
    "the mirror faceplate was heated by a radiant energy from the sun .",
    "the distinct appearance of thermal print - through patterns markedly depends on the thickness of the faceplate and changing thermal environment of the surroundings .",
    "the thermal displacement fea data was converted to surface sag values useful for evaluating the optical quality of the telescope .",
    "the zernike analysis of the sag data showed that while the major contribution to the optical figure error comes from primary , secondary and higher order spherical aberration terms , the thermal print - through arising from underlying hex - cell geometry mainly contributes to low amplitude , mid - spatial frequency surface errors .",
    "a high scatter in ray - traced rms spot size and a steep fall in mtf signifies a severe degradation in optical image quality of high cte ( sic and pyrex ) materials . while sic and pyrex materials show a greater propensity for thermal distortions . but that alone may not be a sufficient ground to completely rule out their usages at least in moderate sized mirrors .",
    "it is also true that sic and pyrex may not be able to match the performance level of ule materials , but in principle , the structural instability can be better ensured by designing an efficient temperature control system .",
    "a higher convective heat transfer coefficient showed only a marginal improvement in the image quality which also reinforces the need for a better cooling mechanism to remove the excessive heat from the m1 .",
    "the approach outlined in this paper would be useful to design an effective thermal control and temperature stabilization system for solar observations .",
    "we would like to thank dr . ping zhou at large optics fabrication and testing group , arizona university , for suggesting to use a faster and more versatile matlab code ` saguaro ' for the zernike analysis ."
