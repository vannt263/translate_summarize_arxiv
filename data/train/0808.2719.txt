    "in the last few years there has been a boom in the study of transport properties at the junction of multiple quantum wires @xcite .",
    "this interest is largely motivated by the fact that junctions of three or more wires would naturally appear in any quantum circuit .",
    "different frameworks have been developed to tackle this complicated problem that shows a rich phase diagram .",
    "in fact , despite of the universality in the bulk of the wires , that are described by a luttinger liquid @xcite , different conditions at the junctions can lead to exotic phase diagrams ( as e.g. those in refs . )",
    "whose degree of universality is not yet understood . according to the renormalization group ( rg ) theory of critical phenomena ,",
    "the low energy properties of a gapless system are captured by the stable fixed point of the rg flow , independently of microscopic ( non - universal ) details of the real system . in view of the universality it is worthy to investigate very simple models , even exactly solvable , that can have ( because of symmetry reasons ) the same fixed points of the real systems . for bulk one - dimensional ( 1d ) models and in the case of a single boundary",
    ", conformal field theory provides a complete classification of the universality classes ( see e.g. ref . ) , whose analogous for junctions ( or star - graph ) is not yet known .",
    "for all these reasons , we investigate in this paper the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model on a junction with an arbitrary number @xmath0 of arms as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figjun ] ( a junction with two wires @xmath1 can be seen as a defect on the line , a problem that has been largely investigated @xcite in the past ) . to solve this problem , at the junction",
    "we impose conditions that are probably not obvious for an electronic problem , but they show the advantage to be exactly solvable .",
    "the natural hope is that the electronic model , at least for some values of the couplings , would be in the domain of attraction of the fixed points found here .",
    "furthermore we calculate the transport for particles with generalized anyonic statistics @xcite .",
    "the reason for this generalization is twofold . on one hand",
    "the study of 1d anyonic model is attracting a renewed interest @xcite , mainly motivated by possible experiments with cold atoms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the transport of wires joined with a quantum hall island is driven by anyonic excitations @xcite .",
    "also in this case we can wonder whether the different problems have some common fixed points . in 1d ,",
    "anyonic statistics are described in terms of fields that at different points ( @xmath2 ) satisfy the commutation relations @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the sign function [ @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is called statistical parameter and equals @xmath10 for bosons and @xmath11 for fermions .",
    "other values of @xmath9 give rise to general anyonic statistics `` interpolating '' between the two familiar ones .",
    "the tl model emerges naturally in the description of spinless fermions in 1d ( and so electrons when the spin degrees of freedom are not important , but spin is also easily introduced in the formalism ) .",
    "in fact , starting from fermions hopping on a chain , linearizing the dispersion relation close to the fermi surface at @xmath12 and taking the continuum limit , one arrives to the standard tl hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13\\ , ,    \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 are the two complex fields representing free - fermions left and right movers , @xmath15 is the fermi velocity , i.e. the speed of the non interacting fermions , and @xmath16\\ , , \\label{chargedensities}\\ ] ] are the two independent charge densities .",

    "eventual irrelevant coupling terms of degree greater than four have been dropped . for @xmath19",

    "we stress that this anyonic model is different from the gases discussed elsewhere @xcite , that also have a luttinger liquid description . as in the fermionic case ,",
    "the model is naturally solved exactly through bosonization @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian defines completely the system on each wire . to complete the description of the junction like the one shown in fig .",

    "the matrix @xmath29 defines the boundary interaction among the fields @xmath30 .",
    "although very natural , this boundary condition is quite complicated after bosonization , because it involves exponential boundary interactions of the bosonic fields . as a consequence",
    "the theory with this interaction term is no longer exactly solvable with bosonization , and very smart and complicated methods must be employed to extract the low - energy behavior from it @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take an alternative approach that is to modify the junction couplings in such a way to preserve the exact solvability after bosonization @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to impose the boundary condition directly on the bosonic degrees of freedom trying to have the same symmetries as in the @xmath30 counterpart .",
    "the two problems can obviously have a different structure of fixed points , but , as stressed above , the natural hope is that the junction defined by eq .",

    "since bosonization expresses physical charges linearly in @xmath46 , we shall see below that these boundary conditions simply state how the charges are parcelled out among the wires at the vertex .",
    "the analysis of the fixed point is greatly simplified if we assume time - reversal invariance .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath96 must be real , that together with unitarity leads to a symmetric matrix @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath99 giving a further constraint on the possible boundary terms .",
    "a non trivial magnetic flux ( breaking time - reversal ) has been considered@xcite and resulted in a more complicated fixed point structure . when dealing with anyon excitation , it would be more natural to consider non time - reversal models , because the magnetic field needed to produce the anyons breaks the symmetry",

    "we stress that the kirchhoff s rule for gapless models on a graph is the generalization of the celebrated result that scale invariance implies holomorphic and antiholomorphic components of the energy tensor to be equal in boundary conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "energy is not the only conserved quantity . in our formalism",
    "it is conserved by construction , but all other conservation laws we want to keep on the junction must be imposed by hand with appropriate kirchhoff s rules",
