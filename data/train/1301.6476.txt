    "blazars are the most extreme class of active galactic nucleies ( agns ) . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by two distinct bumps .",
    "the first bump , which is located at the low energy band from radio through uv or x - rays , is generally explained by the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in a jet that is closely aligned to the line of sight",
    ". the second bump , which is located at the high - energy band , could be produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the relativistic electrons ( the so - called leptonic model ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the seed photons for ic process can be synchrotron photons ( synchrotron self - compton , ssc ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or external radiation fields ( ec ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the leptonic model , a power - law eed with an exponential high - energy cutoff ( plc ) , or a broken power - law eed is commonly adopted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main justification for this eed approximation is that the non - thermal emissions from blazars can be described by a power - law spectrum , and the power - law eed can be naturally generated in the framework of the shock acceleration ( the fermi i process ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in recent observations",
    ", however , the x - ray spectra of several blazars ( like mrk 421 , mrk 501 ) show significant curvature , which are typically milder than an exponential cut - off @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been found that gamma - ray emissions of many blazars are successfully fitted with a log - parabolic ( lp ) spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lp eed is then proposed to model the observed spectral curvature , and such lp eed can be generated in the stochastic turbulence acceleration scenario ( the fermi ii process ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulation indicates that stochastic acceleration process may play an important role in the formation of the particle spectrum in blazar jet @xcite .",
    "when the emission mechanisms are determined , the emitting eed can be reconstructed from the observed emission spectra .",
    "we can then investigate the acceleration processes acting in blazar jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "blazars are well known for their rapid and large - amplitude variability at all wavebands , most prominently at kev and tev energies .",

    ", we learned that tev flare is often correlated with kev flare , however , such relation is very complex .",
    "for example , the tev flux increases more than quadratically with respect to the x - ray one , and there is time lag between tev and kev flares . although sed of mrk 421 is commonly well fitted by a one - zone ssc model , the complex variability behaviors remind us that the realistic model seems more complicated . lately , the multi - wavelength campaign showed evidence for mrk 421 in low / quiescent state from 2009 january 19 to 2009 june 1 @xcite . during this campaign ,",
    "no significant flare activity was seen and the measured vhe flux is among the lowest fluxes recorded by magic .",
    "@xcite therefore claimed that the unprecedented complete , 4.5 months average sed observed during this campaign can be considered as an excellent proxy for the low / quiescent state sed of mrk 421 .",
    "several months later , mrk 421 was found to undergo its one of the brightest outburst at x - rays and gamma - rays bands on february 17 , 2010 @xcite . during this",

    "we investigate the eeds and the acceleration processes in the jet of mrk 421 in low state and giant flare state . to achieve our aim , we assume two electron distributions , both well motivated by the current particle acceleration models : the shock accelerated plc eed and the stochastic turbulence accelerated lp eed , to model the seds in the frame of a one - zone ssc model .",

    "the mcmc method , based on the bayesian statistics , is well suitable for high dimensional parameter space investigation , which is superior to the grid approach with a more efficient sampling of the parameter space of interest .",
    "the metropolis - hastings sampling algorithm is adopted to determine the jump probability from one point to the next in the parameter space @xcite .",

    "the negative correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath2 is predicted for the constant @xmath32 which can be estimated by the observed spectra .",
    "because @xmath33 in the ssc model in the thomson regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the peak frequencies of the synchrotron and ic scattering respectively , the negative correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is expected for the observed @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which implies that the ic scattering is in the thomson regime . in the ssc model",
    ", the radius @xmath14 of the emitting blob relates to the gamma - ray flux ( @xmath36 ) and then can be estimated using the observed gamma - ray flux , meanwhile @xmath37 , hence a negative correlation between @xmath24 and @xmath3 can be predicted . on the other hand , with @xmath38 ,",
    "the synchrotron peak flux can be rewritten as @xmath39 , therefore the positive correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath31 is expected by the constraint of the observed synchrotron peak flux . as to the positive correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath5 , since ic peak flux @xmath40 can be estimated by using the observed gamma - ray flux and @xmath41 , and then @xmath42[\\nu_{\\rm c}/\\nu^2_{\\rm s}]$ ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite are used . therefore , the positive correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath24 can be predicted according to the observations .    for the lp electron distribution , the parameters distributions and sed",

    "it seems that @xmath2 can be better constrained than that in plc model .",
    "the constraints on the other parameters are similar to that derived in the plc model .",

    "the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath13 becomes weak , which is caused by the effect of @xmath17 .",
    "this correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath17 is caused by the well - observed spectrum around the synchrotron peak .",
    "comparing the results derived in the two eeds , it can be found that the global properties of the emitting blob ( @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath14 ) derived in the two cases are comparable . obviously , we can not distinguish between the plc and lp electron distributions in the low state based on the above results ( see figs .",

    "our results indicate that the eed in giant flare state is the lp shape and the stochastic turbulence acceleration is dominant , while in low activity the eed may be the plc shape and the shock acceleration may play a more important role .",
    "this giant flare may be attributed to the re - acceleration of these electrons with plc shape by stochastic process .",
    "basically , we can understand this process from low state to flare state in the scenario proposed by @xcite that electrons injected at the shock front , then are accelerated at shock by fermi i process and subsequently by the stochastic process in the downstream region . here",
    ", we specify this scenario according to our results that the fermi i process accelerated electrons are continuously injected into the emitting blob , and the ssc radiation from the steady eed ( plc shape ) in the emitting blob is responsible for the emission of mrk 421 in low state ; subsequently , the electrons with plc shape are re - accelerated by stochastic process , and the eed with a significant curvature at high energies ( lp ) is formed , whose radiation contributes to the emission in flare state .",
    "a requirement in the scenario is that the magnetic field turbulence spectrum must be the case of the so - called  hard - sphere \" approximation with the spectrum index @xmath46 since for cases of kolmogorov turbulence ( @xmath47 ) and kraichna ( @xmath48 ) turbulence , acceleration efficiency depend on the electron energy ( @xmath49 ) , so that the acceleration efficiency for electrons with @xmath50 is very low and the escape would be dominant over the acceleration of electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario including acceleration process also can account for the spectra hardening in flaring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario can be examined and the details of the flare can be studied in the time - dependent model .",
    "we will study them in the model including acceleration process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we notice that the jet of mrk 421 appears to be particle dominated ( see @xmath51 in table  [ table : low],[table : high ] ) , which is consistent with the result derived by @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress the caveat on ebl constraints we derived . the best - fit spectrum from optical through gev",
