    "it has been observed in central au+au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) that the yield of neutral pions at high transverse momentum ( @xmath1@xmath25  gev/@xmath3 ) is strongly suppressed compared to the one expected from p+p collisions .",
    "this suppression is considered to be an energy loss of hard scattered partons in the medium ( jet quenching ) , that results in a decrease of the yield at a given @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the suppression depends on the path length of scattering partons in the medium , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme_rp ] , impact parameter is experimentally associated with the azimuthal angle of emitted particles from the reaction plane in non - central collisions .",
    "path length can be calculated from glauber model and impact parameter .",
    "studying the path length dependence of energy loss should provide additional information on the energy loss mechanism in the medium .",
    "some theoretical models suggest that lpm effect in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) plays an important role in energy loss mechanism@xcite .",
    "lpm effect in qcd is correlated with path length that partons pass through the medium .",
    "we discuss the parton energy loss mechanism using the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath4 ) of neutral pion with respect to reaction plane .",
    "the nuclear modification factor can be expressed using centrality ( cent ) which is associated to impact parameter for collisions and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath5    where @xmath6 is the number of neutral pions in a given centrality .",
    "@xmath7 is a cross section for inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "a value of @xmath8 implies that particle production is scaled by the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath9 .",
    "the modification factor for each azimuthal angles is expressed by the following equation .",
    "@xmath10    where @xmath6 can be expressed in terms of a fourier expansion with @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 is the strength of azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "a new reaction plane detector , called as rxnp , was installed in the phenix experiment in the year-7 run , and expected to improve the reaction plane resolution .",
    "additionally we obtained 3.5 times higher statistics than rhic year-4 .",
    "the integrated luminosity in year-7 run is 813  @xmath14 .",
    "much precise measurement of the hadron suppression with respect to path length is expected using the detector .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy of neutral pions ( @xmath15 ) is investigated in this report , since measurement of neutral pions up to @xmath1620  gev/@xmath3 is possible with the phenix electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) .",
    "reaction plane of collisions has determined using with the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) before installation of the new detector ( rxnp ) .",
    "rxnp was designed to have a wider rapidity coverage ( 1.0@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath171.5 @xmath19 1.5@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath17 2.8 ) compared with bbc ( 3@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath174 ) .",
    "better resolution in reaction plane determination is achieved with this wider coverage .",
    "phenix has two types of calorimeters .",
    "pbsc , consists of the lead and scintillator plates and wavelength shifter fiber readout .",
    "another type is lead - glass calorimeter ( pbgl ) .",
    "the pbsc has a nominal energy and position resolution of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the pbgl has a nominal energy resolution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we selected events with a vertex position within @xmath24 30  cm on z - axis .",
    "for each selected event , made was determination of reaction plane .",
    "reaction plane is experimentally determined by the direction which the greatest number of particles are emitted . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : invmass ] , neutral pions are identified by 2  @xmath25 invariant mass calculated in same event .",
    "the combinatorial background is evaluated with event mixing technique which 2 @xmath25 candidates in different events are calculated .",
    "neutral pions are counted in a given mass window ( typically 2  @xmath26 from peak position of 2  @xmath25 invariant mass distribution . ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme_rp ] , the number of counted neutral pions are divided into six @xmath11 bins in the interval from 0 to @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath11 means the angle which are subtracted the direction to the reaction plane from the angular direction to the emitted particles .",
    "this reaction plane can be determined by bbc or rxnp . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndphi ] , we fit the following eq.([eq : dndphi_appro ] ) .",
    "@xmath28    where @xmath29 is observed raw azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "the true azimuthal anisotropy @xmath30 needs to be corrected by the reaction plane resolution@xcite .",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is a difference between the true azimuthal angle from reaction plane and the observed angle from reaction plane . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpreso ] , the new detector ( rxnp ) could improve this @xmath33 value .                 with rxnp result for 20@xmath34 centrality steps .",

    "both of bbc and rxnp can measure reaction plane of collisions .",
    "thus @xmath37 difference between these detectors is taken into account as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the evaluation for @xmath13 difference has been done by measurement of charged pion @xmath13 with bbc and rxnp . for centrality 0 - 20@xmath34 step ,",
    "systematic uncertainty of the @xmath36 counting ( 1@xmath17@xmath1@xmath173 , 3@xmath17@xmath1@xmath175 , 5@xmath17@xmath1@xmath1710  gev/@xmath3 ) is 9@xmath34 , 7@xmath34 and 12@xmath34 , respectively .",

    "thus measurement of @xmath37 can be done up to higher @xmath1 region .",
    "the path length dependence of @xmath39 needs to measure in smaller centrality steps .",
    "more precisely study of path length dependence of @xmath39 can be done by better reaction plane resolution and higher statistics than the year-4 run .",
    "measurement of azimuthal anisotropy of neutral pion has been done by @xmath35 of total data using new detector ( rxnp ) .",
    "this detector has achieved twice better reaction plane resolution than with bbc .",
    "the values of @xmath37 with bbc and rxnp still remains finite up to @xmath3810  gev/@xmath3 .    for studying the path length dependence of @xmath36 suppression ,",
