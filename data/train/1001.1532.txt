    "the strength of the h@xmath0o transition suggests a significant reservoir of water vapor toward iras4b .",

    "i.e. , comparable to the deconvolved size of the h@xmath0o emission here .",
    "our inferred column density is almost unchanged if the excitation temperature is lowered to 100  k and increases by up to a factor 5 if the temperature is increased to 1000  k. these temperatures cover the range of conditions expected for any of the scenarios for the origin of the h@xmath8o emission discussed in  [ introduction ] .",
    "the total mass contained in the detected h@xmath8o is 6.0@xmath43  @xmath36 , or 0.02  @xmath5 . assuming a typical h@xmath8o abundance relative to h@xmath8 of 10@xmath7 , corresponding to sublimation of the h@xmath8o rich dust ice mantles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "is 0.24  @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the h@xmath0o emission has its origin in this disk , it arises in a small fraction @xmath45% of the material in the disk .    alternatively , in the absence of such a disk , it is possible that the emission has its origin in the hot inner region of the protostellar envelope where the temperature is @xmath46  k : for a simple power - law envelope density profile reproducing the submillimeter continuum emission for iras4b on scales larger than @xmath471000  au ( 2.8  @xmath36 within 8000  au ; @xcite ) , the mass within 25  au ( where the temperature is higher than about 100  k ) is about 5@xmath1610@xmath48 , implying a h@xmath8o abundance of about 1.5@xmath44 .",
    "however , such a model is not self - consistent on small scales : to fit the observed compact dust continuum emission seen by the interferometer a strong increase in the envelope density on small scales by two orders of magnitude is required  above the already increasing radial density profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , if such a density enhancement was due to a magnetic field wall as discussed above @xcite , the h@xmath8o abundance would be lower by the same amount , dropping to about 1.5@xmath49 .",

    "a low h@xmath8o abundance in the region of grain - mantle desorption may reflect destruction of h@xmath8o by x - rays @xcite , but the h@xmath8o abundance would need to be reduced to the levels of the outer cold envelope where h@xmath8o is frozen - out and thus could not provide the compact emission observed here",
    ".    models of the chemistry in more evolved disks around pre - main sequence stars ( where the envelope has dissipated ) show a warm upper layer where h@xmath8o gas can exist . although these models are not fully appropriate for disks in the embedded phase , where uv photons may not be able to freely reach the disk surface and heat the gas , they provide a useful reference point for comparison .",
    "if the h@xmath8o gas phase abundance is just determined by the balance of photodesorption of h@xmath8o ice and freeze - out , typical gaseous h@xmath8o column densities at 1025 au are a few @xmath50 @xmath38 , dropping rapidly at larger radii in these models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only slightly lower than those found here .",
    "alternatively , the temperatures in the upper layers of the disk may be hot enough to drive an active gas - phase chemistry .",

    "the h@xmath8o mass in this layer is @xmath54 @xmath5 in their model , about two orders of magnitude lower than derived on basis of the h@xmath0o observations presented in this paper .",
    "because their h@xmath8o / h@xmath8 abundance is only @xmath55 , the inferred total warm h@xmath8 mass is comparable .",
    "the discrepancy between the column densities from these data and those from the _ spitzer _ mid - infrared observations @xcite remains significant , though .",
    "a possible explanation is that the mid - infrared observations are limited by extinction and thus do not probe the total water column density .",
    "alternatively , a lower temperature of the h@xmath8o emitting gas of @xmath56  k could with an unchanged column density keep the observed h@xmath0o line intensity at the same level while decreasing the mid - ir line flux predicted by the model .",
    "it also remains a question why iras4b is the only source with strong h@xmath8o lines at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that iras4b was either seen in a particularly favorable geometry  with the h@xmath8o mid - infrared emission from disks around other sources being masked by optically thick envelopes  or that the release of h@xmath8o into the gas - phase constituted a particularly short - lived stage in the evolution of embedded protostars .",
    "these scenarios could easily be distinguished by further observations of h@xmath0o emission from embedded protostars at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths where the envelopes are optically thin and water should thus be detectable if present at similar levels as in iras4b .",
    "future observations with the atacama large millimeter array in band 5 will fully open this topic up for ground - based observations of large samples of embedded protostars in the same lines .",
