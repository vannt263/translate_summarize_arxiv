    "<S> we theoretically investigate an adjustable - radius magnetic storage ring for laser - cooled and bose - condensed atoms . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we discuss a novel time - dependent variant of this and other ring traps . </S>",
    "<S> time - orbiting ring traps provide a high optical access method for spin - flip loss prevention near a storage ring s circular magnetic field zero . </S>",
    "<S> our scalable storage ring will allow one to probe the fundamental limits of condensate sagnac interferometry .    </S>",
    "<S> the field of atom optics @xcite has been transformed by laser cooling @xcite and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> prior to laser cooling , atoms could only be magnetically deflected by small angles , due to the relatively weak nature of the interaction and the large atomic velocities involved @xcite . with the advent of laser cooling , </S>",
    "<S> atomic beams have been magnetically deflected by much larger angles @xcite , and cold atomic clouds have been magnetically reflected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> storage rings for cold atoms are atom - optical elements which have only been realised very recently @xcite .    to date , </S>",
    "<S> all experimental cold atom storage rings are generated with magnetic fields where the ( fixed ) radius of the ring is determined by the radii of the ring s magnetic elements ( fig .  [ contvec ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , these storage rings are formed at a zero in the magnetic field , thus atoms - particularly the cold atoms - can spin - flip into non - trapped magnetic quantum states at the centre of the ring @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a long current - carrying wire along the symmetry ( @xmath0 ) axis of the storage ring can generate an azimuthal magnetic field around the ring , preventing spin - flip losses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , optical access to the storage ring is limited by such a wire , and the wire must either be in - vacuo or a ` hole ' in the vacuum chamber is required . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new variable - radius magnetic storage ring . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we show how , by adding a time - orbiting term to the magnetic field , it is possible to create a storage ring which is stable with respect to spin flips , without the necessity of an axial current - carrying wire .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that a cold molecule storage ring based on electric dipole forces has also been developed @xcite , however , although cold molecules are interesting in their own right , atoms are more suitable candidates for many interferometry experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to molecules , atoms can easily be prepared in the same quantum state , and they can be cooled to temperatures hundreds of times colder than molecules due to the ease with which they can be laser cooled .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic atom - optical elements use the stern - gerlach potential @xmath1 an atom experiences whilst moving adiabatically in a magnetic field of magnitude @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bohr magneton , @xmath4 is the atom s hyperfine magnetic quantum number , and @xmath5 is the land g - factor . </S>",
    "<S> we consider weak - field - seeking atoms @xmath6    we begin by discussing a second - order model for the magnetic field , as it neatly describes the main features of the storage ring . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approximation is only used as an illustration and all figures in this paper are calculated using the full biot - savart law for circular coils @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if a cylindrically symmetric magnetic coil configuration is used , then maxwell s equations and the on - axis behaviour of the magnetic field lead to the complete 3d taylor expansion of the magnetic field . in particular , the second - order on - axis 1d magnetic field , @xmath7 gives the complete 3d second - order magnetic field : @xmath8 we note that these results are contrary to those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the behaviour of the axial magnetic field in the @xmath9 radial plane was used to generate a 3d second - order magnetic field different to that of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ field ] .    </S>",
    "<S> an axially - separated double trap @xcite is formed when @xmath10 and a ring trap is formed when @xmath11 by solving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ field ] and finding the magnetic field zero , the radial and axial location of the storage ring are found : @xmath12 the gradient of the magnetic field magnitude near the centre of the storage ring is identical in the axial @xmath13 and radial @xmath14 directions , @xmath15 and atoms experience a potential which is approximately conical : @xmath16    the simplest geometry for creating a ring trap is with two concentric co - planar circular coils of radius @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , carrying currents with magnitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 in opposite directions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ contvec2 ] a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the storage ring is adjusted by varying the ratio of currents @xmath21 in the coils . </S>",
    "<S> such a storage ring is formed in the plane of the two coils , and therefore requires an in - vacuo coil system . </S>",
    "<S> two axially - displaced concentric coils can also be used to form the storage ring . </S>",
    "<S> however , the symmetry and additional confinement provided by two concentric , equally spaced , pairs of opposing ` helmholtz ' coils , make them a more apt configuration for an ex - vacuo coil system ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ contvec2 ] b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the orientation of the currents in the standard two and four coil storage ring ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ contvec ] ) is different from the equivalent variable radius storage ring ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ contvec2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum coil current used in all of our figures is @xmath22 amp - turns , which is identical to some of the coils used in our existing storage ring experiment @xcite .    in order to generate a time - orbiting ring trap ( tort ) </S>",
    "<S> we simply need to time - dependently alter the radial and axial position of the ring of zero magnetic field ( given approximately in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zeropos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , adding small sinusoidally varying @xmath23 and @xmath24 terms mainly shift the @xmath0 and @xmath25 positions , respectively , of the storage ring magnetic zero point . </S>",
    "<S> varying @xmath23 and @xmath24 in quadrature leads to the kind of magnetic field zero trajectory shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tortgraf ] b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be either be achieved by using separate pairs of anti - helmholtz @xmath26 and helmholtz @xmath27 and @xmath28 or ` true ' helmholtz @xmath29 coils , or by adding sinusoidal modulations with the appropriate amplitude and relative phase to the two separate coils of one of the helmholtz coil pairs in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ contvec2 ] b ) . for the magnetic zero trajectory shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tortgraf ] b ) , we change the currents of the ` pure ' helmholtz coils at radius @xmath30 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ contvec2 ] b ) from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 change the @xmath25 and @xmath0 position of the storage ring , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> a tort trap transforms a storage ring s conical magnetic potential ( eq .  [ pot ] ) into a time - averaged hyperbolic potential . </S>",
    "<S> a useful parameter is the time - averaged magnet field magnitude at trap centre @xmath36 the frequency of the tort current modulation @xmath37 needs to be at approximately the geometric mean of the harmonic tort trap frequency @xmath38 and the trap s larmor frequency @xmath39 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this frequency is typical for time - orbiting quadrupole traps , and we note that the coils involved in both time - orbiting quadrupole and ring traps have similar dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we have concentrated here on a time - orbiting variant of our adjustable - radius storage ring , however similar techniques exist for making a time - orbiting fixed - radius storage ring .    in order to make a bose condensate in the storage ring , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to localise the atoms in a magnetic potential that is three - dimensionally harmonic for efficient evaporative cooling . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we discuss how we use four magnetic pinch coils to transform a sector of a storage ring into both a magneto - optical trap @xcite and a ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same technique can be used with our adjustable - radius storage ring . </S>",
    "<S> after evaporative cooling and subsequent condensation in the ioffe - pritchard trap , the pinch coils can be adiabatically turned off and bragg scattering @xcite can be used to coherently launch condensate wavepackets around the tort .    an important limitation to the performance of interferometers using bose - einstein condensates is that in storage rings ( and other traps with elongated geometries ) , condensates break up into fragments with different phases . </S>",
    "<S> such phase fluctuations @xcite can be reduced if the temperature in the trap is very low . </S>",
    "<S> the tunable radius of the ring allows one to find ideal conditions for sagnac interferometry : i.e. by finding the maximum ring area over which phase fluctuations are negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that an adjustable - radius magnetic storage ring trap for bose - condensed atoms will be a very useful atom - optical tool . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , our novel time - orbiting ring trap ( tort ) , does not require an axial current - carrying wire , providing a high optical access method for spin - flip loss prevention near a storage ring s circular magnetic field zero . </S>",
    "<S> our scalable storage ring will allow one to study persistent currents , and probe the fundamental limits of bose - einstein condensate sagnac interferometry .    </S>",
