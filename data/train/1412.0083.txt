    "direct detection of binary companions of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is challenging because the companions are overwhelmed by the luminous agb stars .",
    "moreover , companions of very dusty `` infrared '' agb stars can be totally obscured by the circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) .",
    "to date , binary companions have been detected for only a small number of agb stars with low mass - loss rates through composite spectra or lightcurves @xcite .",
    "there are indications that a significant fraction of agb stars have binary companions , such as elliptical cses @xcite as expected from binary agb stars @xcite and spiral - shell patterns in the cses @xcite as modeled by agb winds under the gravitational influence of binary companions @xcite .    since its discovery @xcite , irc+10216 , the nearest carbon star , has been the subject of multi - wavelength observations aimed at detecting new molecules or studying the circumstellar dust and chemistry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the overall shape of its cse , detected up to radius @xmath1 , is fairly spherical .",
    "due to its proximity ( distance @xmath2pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the envelope has been resolved , exhibiting multiple shells with noticeably different geometric centers @xcite .",
    "the dynamical timescale of shell separation , 200800 years , is far longer than the pulsation period of irc+10216 and significantly shorter than the periods between thermal pulses ( of order of @xmath3 years , @xcite ) .",
    "the shell geometry must have been caused by other mechanisms , possibly binary interactions as considered previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the shell center offsets can be reproduced by a spiral - shell model of irc+10216 with enhanced mass loss when a companion approaches periastron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations show that the morphology and kinematics of its inner parts are consistent with those expected from binary interactions @xcite .",
    "high - resolution optical images of irc+10216 taken in the years around 2000 revealed a bipolar nebula @xmath4@xmath5 in size , with the northeast lobe significantly fainter than the southwest lobe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this nebula was further modeled as an inclined bi - conical structure @xcite . upon examination of all archival _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) images of irc+10216 s core , we find that in 2011 the aforementioned bipolar nebula had disappeared and a different set of peaks appeared .",
    "we identify the brightest peak and a fainter point - like source as the central star and its companion . in this paper , we report our analysis of archival data of irc+10216 and discuss its physical nature .",
    "three images of irc+10216 taken with the f606w filter were retrieved from the _ hst _ archives : epoch 1 on 1998 march 30 with the wfpc2 camera ( pid 6856 ; p.i .",
    "john trauger ) for a total integration time of @xmath6s ; epoch 2 on 2001 january 7 with the wfpc2 and @xmath7s ( pid 8601 ; p.i .",
    "patrick seitzer ) , and epoch 3 on 2011 june 4 with the wfc3 camera and @xmath8s ( pid 12205 ; p.i .",
    "toshiya ueta ) .",
    "the wfpc2 and wfc3 fields are about 25@xmath925 and 3@xmath93 , and the pixel sizes are 01 and 004 , respectively .",
    "the three f606w images are displayed in figure[fig : hst ] .",
    "it can be seen at once that a very drastic change of structure has occurred between epoch 2 and 3 . a f814w image taken at epoch 3",
    "( figure[fig : hst](d ) ) from the same program is saturated at the brightest peak but shows an , otherwise , almost identical morphology to the f606w image .    to compare these images ,",
    "an astrometric analysis was performed using the ccmap package of iraf @xcite .",
    "three well - detected stars located within 40  from irc+10216 and identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) catalog @xcite were chosen for reference .",
    "only one of these stars is well - detected in the shallow epoch 2 image ; therefore , we use two compact galaxies and one star to bootstrap the astrometry from the epoch 1 and 3 images .",
    "the combined uncertainty in the astrometric alignment between each pair of images is @xmath10008 .",
    "we have used the catalina sky survey @xcite data to investigate the variability of irc+10216 .",
    "the catalina lightcurve of irc+10216 , shown in figure[fig : lc3](a ) , covers 20052014 . as the catalina sky survey used unfiltered images to maximize throughput",
    ", these photometric measurements correspond to passbands depending on a star s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the ccd responses .",
    "irc+10216 is a very red object with possible phase - dependent color variations .",
    "therefore , we compared the catalina photometry with contemporaneous sdss data ( from 2006 january 6 ) in different passbands , and found that the sdss @xmath11 band had a similar value ( indicated by a filled cyan circle in figure[fig : lc3](a ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss @xmath12 and @xmath13 band magnitudes were off by @xmath14 and @xmath15 mag , respectively .",
    "we searched for similar monitoring data from earlier epochs , and found two with extensive coverage and both were in infrared wavelengths : @xmath16 for 19851989 @xcite and @xmath17 for 20002008 @xcite .",
    "the latter overlapped the catalina monitoring for 34 years .",
    "these infrared lightcurves are shown in figure[fig : lc3](b)(c ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "f606w images from the three epochs are shown in figure[fig : hst ] .",
    "the 1998 and 2001 images are qualitatively similar , exhibiting a bright southwest lobe and a fainter northeast lobe , previously identified as a bipolar structure .",
    "the 2011 image shows a dramatically different morphology : the brightest peak appears to be at a different location , and the region within @xmath18 from the peak has a more complex structure , including a point - like source at 05 east of the peak .",
    "there is no trace of the previously identified bipolar structure . using a 6-radius source aperture and a background annulus of radii 1416 ,",
    "we have measured the _ hst _",
    "f606w magnitudes of irc+10216 to be 17.29 , 17.15 , and 16.93 mag in 1998 , 2001 , and 2011 , respectively .",
    "images from the three epochs have been aligned astrometrically with respect to background stars and galaxies ; however , to properly determine the differences among the images , the proper motion of irc+10216 has to be considered . using radio continuum observations made with the very large array ( vla ) ,",
    "the proper motion of irc+10216 has been reported to be @xmath19 mas yr@xmath20 in ra and @xmath21 mas yr@xmath20 in dec @xcite .",
    "for this proper motion , the brightest peak in 2011 would correspond to positions close to , albeit not exactly on , the peaks in 1998 and 2001 .",
    "the offsets ( both about 018 ) are small , but larger than the uncertainty in the differential astrometry ( @xmath10008 ) .",
    "the observed peak positions from 1998 , 2001 , and 2011 and the expected 1998 and 2001 positions of the 2011 peak are plotted in figure[fig : pro ] .",
    "it is interesting to compare the 2011 peak position with the central position of irc+10216 reported from high - resolution radio observations .",
    "the radio continuum emission of irc+10216 originates from its radio photosphere @xcite , and its j2000 coordinates observed with the vla in epoch 2006.16 are 09@xmath2247@xmath2357@xmath24.4255 , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the j2000 coordinates of irc+10216 derived from alma observations at a higher radio frequency in the epoch 2012.92 are 09@xmath2247@xmath2357@xmath24.4553 , @xmath2643749 , different from the proper - motion - corrected vla position by @xmath0026 , close to the error limit @xcite . comparing these positions with the optical position of the 2011 peak ( 09@xmath2247@xmath2357@xmath24.4189 , @xmath27",
    "; see figure[fig : pro ] ) , we see a 03 offset between the optical peak in 2011 and the vla radio peak expected in 2011 . considering that the absolute astrometry of _ hst _ can reach 0103",
    "when a large number of reference stars are available @xcite , the uncertainty of our absolute astrometry of irc+10216 based on only 3 reference stars must be at least 03 .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the radio peak and the 2011 optical peak are coincident within the uncertainty of the _ hst _ astrometry .",
    "the catalina lightcurve of irc+10216 in figure[fig : lc3](a ) shows a gradual trend of brightening from 2005 to 2014 , in addition to the stellar pulsation of the carbon star . to quantify the brightening",
    ", we fit the lightcurve in figure[fig : lc3](a ) with a sinusoidal term and a linear term : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the observed magnitude at epoch @xmath30 and @xmath31@xmath32 are constants .",
    "the best - fit model has @xmath33 mag for the amplitude of the sinusoidal variations ; @xmath34 days for the period of the sinusoidal variations ; and @xmath35 mag yr@xmath20 for the brightening rate in the catalina photometry .",
    "the derived pulsation period of the carbon star is consistent with the range of values from infrared bands ( 649 days , @xcite ; 630 days , @xcite ) .",
    "no similar monitoring records at earlier epochs in unfiltered or @xmath11 band are available to show the onset of the brightening trend .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "f606w measurements span 14 years , but do not provide sufficient data points to constrain the parameters in equation ( [ eqn : fit ] ) .",
    "irc+10216 was monitored in the infrared bands in 19851989 @xcite and 20002008 @xcite .",
    "these lightcurves are plotted in figure[fig : lc3](b ) and ( c ) , and fitted by equation ( [ eqn : fit ] ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 lightcurves in the 1980s show systematic brightening trends at rates of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 mag yr@xmath20 , but at longer wavelengths the @xmath42 and @xmath43 lightcurves have nearly null brightening rates .",
    "interestingly , the brightening trends in the near - infrared wavelengths vanished in the 2000s , when all observed infrared magnitudes stayed at a constant level with smaller amplitudes of sinusoidal variations ( see figure[fig : lc3](c ) ) .",
    "the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 magnitudes seem to become fainter by 0.30.7 mag from epoch 1989.5 to epoch 1999.9 .",
    "the lightcurves of irc+10216 are clearly complex .",
    "the important features that need to be noted are : ( 1 ) there is the brightening trend of broad - band optical magnitudes in 20052014 and of near - infrared bands in 19851989 ; ( 2 ) the near - infrared @xmath44 magnitudes vary around nearly constant levels in 20002008 , although the optical magnitudes show brightening in 2005 - 2008 ; and ( 3 ) the mid - infrared bands of @xmath42 and @xmath43 show periodic variations around constant levels during all monitoring campaigns , regardless of the brightening trends in other bands .",
    "the innermost region in the cse of irc+10216 in the 2011 _ hst _ image exhibits a strikingly different appearance from those of 1998 and 2001 ( figure[fig : hst ] ) .",
    "this large modification of optical core structure has occurred in @xmath4510 years ; optical and infrared lightcurves have both shown brightening trends with a similar timescale .",
    "this timescale is much shorter than the stellar evolutionary timescale ( @xmath46@xmath3 years ) associated with thermal pulsing behavior and is not likely due to variation in the stellar luminosity .",
    "since the dust envelope of irc+10216 is optically thick , the stellar radiation is absorbed and reemitted mostly in infrared wavelengths ; its sed peak is near @xmath47 m or beyond in mid - infrared @xcite .",
    "the lack of long - term variations in the mid - infrared @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands indicates that the stellar luminosity is steady .",
    "the timescale of @xmath4510 years may be appropriate for photospheric or inner circumstellar changes .",
    "for example , a progressive rarefaction of the inner envelope allows penetration of stellar radiation , which can be detected in optical and near - infrared bands as a gradual brightening",
    ". the brightening trend could be also variable scattering due to changes in the geometry of the circumstellar material .",
    "therefore , the brightening trends in the optical and near - infrared lightcurves likely imply the change of intervening circumstellar dusts in the @xmath4510-year timescale , which may account for the recent changes of optical morphology in the core of irc+10216 .      the 2011 _ hst _ f606w image of irc+10216 s core shows an elongated feature centered on the brightest peak .",
    "we have established in section [ sec : hst ] that this peak is coincident with the expected radio peak within the uncertainties of absolute astrometry ; therefore , we identify this brightest peak as the central star of irc+10216 . the expected locations of this central star in 1998 and 2001 are both offset from the brightest peak by @xmath0 018 ( or 23 au ) .",
    "this offset is larger than the uncertainty in the relative astrometry ( @xmath10008 ) .",
    "it is likely that the brightest peaks in 1998 and 2001 were both dust clump in close vicinity of the central star .    a dust lane of irc+10216 , extending up to @xmath48 in the east - west direction , is recently presented by @xcite in a linearly polarized optical intensity map . by placing the brightest peak in the _ hst _ 2011 image at their suggested location of central star in the dust lane",
    ", we have noticed that our elongated structure ( pa @xmath49 ) is perpendicular to their dust lane ( pa @xmath50 ) and connects the brightest parts in the two lobes of polarized optical light .",
    "the width of our elongated structure is @xmath0 1020au ( or 510 stellar radii with the photospheric radius of irc+10216 @xmath0 2 au suggested by @xcite ) , which is similar to the radius of a dust formation zone or the inner radii used in the torus and ring models of @xcite .",
    "the elongated structure could be caused by either an illumination or a confined outflow through the central hole of a dense equatorial torus .",
    "the elongated structure consists of two compact blobs on two opposite sides of our suggested central star .",
    "both blobs are @xmath0 02 from the central star ; assuming the same expansion speed as the outer envelope ( @xmath0 15 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they could be launched about 8 years ago .",
    "we also note that the elongated structure extends up to @xmath0 04 , which corresponds to about 26 stellar radii .",
    "the elongated structure is slightly curved , thus shaped like a spiral or a point - symmetric structure .",
    "one of the exciting findings from the 2011 _ hst _ image is the emergence of a point - like source at 05 east of the central star ( indicated by an arrow in figure[fig : hst](d ) ) .",
    "this source is projected within the dust lane of @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of its profile , 015 , is within the range of 009017 measured for 10 unsaturated images of isolated stars .",
    "the color ( @xmath51 ) of this point - like source is redder than those of diffuse clumps scattered over the inner @xmath18 region ( denoted by 1 to 4 in figure[fig : hst](c ) ) by a factor of @xmath52 , suggesting a different nature from the ambient matter .",
    "we posit that this point - like source is a companion star of irc+10216 .",
    "its @xmath12 magnitude determined by referencing to sdss stars is @xmath53 mag . assuming that circumstellar extinction follows the interstellar extinction law and adopting the distance 130pc ,",
    "one can derive physical parameters of this companion candidate . for a @xmath54 density distribution of the envelope , the column density to the source at radius @xmath55",
    "is calculated to be @xmath56 of that to the center , where @xmath57 represents the radius of dust formation zone ( 15au is adopted ) . for a visual optical depth",
    "@xmath58 derived from an sed fitting by @xcite , the visual extinction toward the companion candidate would be @xmath59mag . with this extinction ,",
    "its @xmath12 magnitude best matches a main - sequence star with a spectral type of m1 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "it is , however , very tentative because of uncertainties in the circumstellar extinction coefficients , inhomogeneity of agb wind , and unknown line - of - sight location of the point - like source .",
    "if the point - like source seen in 2011 is indeed a binary companion , we can assess its possible orbit and proper motion .",
    "assuming that the projected separation of 05 ( i.e. , 65au ) corresponds to the orbital semi - major axis @xmath61 , the orbital velocity of a binary component with respect to the other is @xmath62 , where @xmath43 is the total binary mass .",
    "this speed corresponds to 001 per year for an assumed total binary mass of @xmath63 . assuming a fitting accuracy of @xmath64",
    ", its movement may be observable in a few years from 2011 in the best case .",
    "the formula for binary dynamics @xmath65 yields the orbital period @xmath66 of 330yr@xmath67 .",
    "this period is consistent with the timescale of 200800yr derived from the intervals between the outer shell patterns @xcite , which , in binary - induced spiral - shell models , represents the orbital period ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the candidate for companion of irc+10216",
    "is proposed based on its point - like appearance , projection onto the dust lane , and color difference from nearby diffuse clumps .",
    "its photometric and orbital period properties are not inconsistent with a low - mass main - sequence star .",
    "however , the absence of the companion candidate in the earlier epochs remains an open question since its orbital motion , if _ circular _",
    ", is rather slow to explain its relative position .",
    "a speed @xmath68 is required to move 05 in 10 years . from a single imaging data",
    ", we can not rule out a possibility that this point - like source could be a _ compact _ clump originated from small scale fluctuations in the dust condensation radius of irc+10216 .",
    "further observations and quantitative modeling are desired to better investigate this object in the current and near future , especially since the giant star in irc+10216 will reach the next light minimum in march 2016 when the companion is less overwhelmed .",
