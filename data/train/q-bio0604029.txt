    "+ gene expression in bacterial cells is modulated to enhance the cell s performance in changing environmental conditions . to this end ,",
    "transcription regulatory networks continuously sense a set of signals and perform computations to adjust the gene expression profile of the cell .",
    "a subset of such signals contains molecules that the cell can metabolize .",
    "these molecules range from nutrients to toxic compounds .",
    "a commonly occurring motif in the networks sensing such signal molecules is a negative feedback loop .  in this motif",
    "an enzyme used to metabolize the signal molecule is controlled by a regulator whose action , in turn , is regulated by the same signal molecule .",
    "this motif allows for genes that are not transcription factors to negatively regulate their own synthesis .    because these negative feedback loops are situated at the interface of genetic @xcite and metabolic @xcite networks , understanding their behavior is crucial for building integrated network models , as well as synthetic gene circuits @xcite .",
    "in fact , if one ignores the interface , the network topology gives the impression that feed back mechanisms are less frequent than feed forward loops @xcite .",
    "in addition , by ignoring feedback associated to signal molecules one would also tend to overemphasize the modular features of the overall system @xcite and underemphasize the average number of incoming links to proteins . even within the framework of a negative feedback loop",
    "there are several different mechanisms possible both for transcriptional regulation and for the action of the signal molecule .",
    "we list below four mechanisms which are present in living cells , with examples taken from _",
    "[ schematic ] ) : +    \\(i ) the regulator , r , represses the transcription of the enzyme , e , which metabolizes the signal molecule , s. the signal molecule binds to the repressor resulting in the dissociation of the r - operator complex and an increase in the production of e. this mechanism is exemplified by a negative feedback loop in the _ lac _ system @xcite , where the roles of r , e and s are played by laci , @xmath0-galactosidase , and lactose , respectively .",
    "+ ( ii ) r represses the transcription of e which metabolizes s. but here the signal molecule can bind to r even when it is at the operator site . when this happens the effect of r on the promoter activity is cancelled , or even reversed .",
    "two examples of this kind are the _ bet _ @xcite and _ mer _ @xcite systems , which are involved in the response of cells to the harmful conditions of osmotic stress and presence of mercury ions , respectively .",
    "+ ( iii ) here the regulator , r , is an activator of the transcription of e when s is bound to it . without the signal molecule ,",
    "r can not bind to the dna site and activate transcription .",
    "for instance , malt in complex with maltose is a transcriptional activator of genes which metabolize maltose .",
    "this mechanism differs from ( ii ) in that in the absence of s , r is a repressor in ( ii ) while here it does not affect the promoter activity . + ( iv ) here too",
    ", r alone can not bind to the operator site .",
    "however , in contrast to ( iii ) , r bound to s represses the transcription of e. further , in this case e increases the production of the signal molecule , rather than metabolizing it , thereby again making the overall feedback negative .",
    "one such example is the regulation of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis by purr @xcite .",
    "+ a major difference between these four loops is the manner in which the signal molecule acts . in ( i ) the binding of s to r drastically reduces its affinity to the dna site . on the other hand , in ( ii ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) , the signal molecule increases , or does not significantly alter , the binding affinity of r and can also affect the action of the regulator when it is bound to the dna",
    ". henceforth we will refer to these two methods of action as ` mechanism ( 1 ) ' and ` mechanism ( 2 ) ' .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated how this difference in the mechanism of action of the signal molecule translates to differences in the steady state and dynamical behaviour of the simplest kind of negative feedback loops containing proteins and signal molecules .",
    "these loops have only one step , e , between the regulator and the signal molecule .",
    "further , the regulator is assumed to have only one binding site on the dna .",
    "we concentrate on the cases where r is a repressor and s lifts the repression ( i and ii ) . in particular , we show that the two mechanisms differ substantially in their dynamic behaviour when r is large enough to fully repress the promoter of e in the absence of s. we illustrate how the difference is used in cells by the examples of the _ bet _ , _ mer _ and _ lac _ systems .",
    "+       + first we consider how the steady state activity of the promoter of e responds to changes in the concentration of s for each of the mechanisms .",
    "consider a feedback loop , like fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ( i ) , where the operator can be found in one of two states : free , @xmath1 , and bound to the regulator , @xmath2 , with the total concentration of operator sites being a constant : @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the promoter is active only when the operator is free , and completely repressed when it is bound by r. this loop uses mechanism ( 1 ) and is an idealization of the _ lac _ system in _ e. coli_. the promoter activity is given by : @xmath4 in steady state , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be expressed as functions of the total concentration of regulators , @xmath5 , and the concentration of signal molecules , @xmath6 .",
    "the expression also contains the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the equilibrium binding constant for r - operator binding and the corresponding hill coefficient ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( for r - s binding . )",
    "equation [ eq : mech1_full ] in the methods section contains all the details .",
    "the main effect of s is to decrease the amount of free r because @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the concentration of the r - s complex .    for a feedback loop using mechanism ( 2 )",
    ", the operator can be found in one of three states : free , @xmath1 , bound to the regulator , @xmath2 , and bound to the regulator along with the signal molecule , @xmath13",
    ". the total concentration of operator sites , @xmath14 , is constant .",
    "the promoter activity has a basal value ( normalized to 1 ) when the operator is free .",
    "when the regulator alone is bound it represses the activity .",
    "we assume the activity in this state is zero . when the operator is bound by r along with s the activity returns to the basal level .",
    "this is an idealization of the _ bet _ system . here",
    ", the promoter activity is given by : @xmath15    the main effect of s comes from the second term in the numerator of equation 2 , which is the concentration of the r - s - operator complex . as in the case of @xmath16 , in steady state",
    "the activity can be expressed in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . because of the third state of the operator , @xmath13 , the expression for @xmath17 includes one more parameter , @xmath18 , the equilibirum binding constant for r - operator binding when s is bound to r ( see equation [ eq : mech2_full ] in the methods section for details . )    for mechanism ( 2 ) , we mainly consider the case where @xmath19 , i.e. , the binding of the signal molecule does not change the binding affinity of the regulator to the operator .",
    "this is the simplest situation and illustrates the basic differences between the two mechanisms . in real systems these binding constants are often different .",
    "however , as we show , for _ bet _ and _ mer _ the inequality of @xmath18 and @xmath7 does not obscure the differences caused by the two mechanisms of action of the signal molecule .",
    "this is because the main effect of changing @xmath18 is simply to shift the position of the response curve .",
    "only when @xmath18 becomes very large ( which results in dissociation of r from the operator when s binds to it , as in _ lac _ ) does mechanism ( 2 ) effectively reduce to mechanism ( 1 ) .",
    "figure [ 3dplot ] shows the activities @xmath16 and @xmath17 for a range of values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the following observations can be made from the figure :    * for sufficiently small values of @xmath5 there is no difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . * from @xmath20 and higher , @xmath16 requires larger and larger s to rise to its maximum value , i.e. , its effective binding constant @xmath21 increases with @xmath5 ( where we define @xmath21 to be the value of @xmath6 at which the activity is half - maximum . )",
    "* @xmath17 , on the other hand , has a @xmath21 which is remarkably robust to changes in @xmath5 , remaining close to @xmath9 for @xmath22 . *",
    "zooming in to the low @xmath6 region shows that @xmath17 rises more steeply than @xmath16 for small @xmath6 values .",
    "all these features can be explained by taking a closer look at the equations for @xmath16 ( eq . [ eq : mech1_partial ] and [ eq : mech1_full ] ) and @xmath17 ( eq . [ eq : mech2_partial ] and [ eq : mech2_full ] . ) taking the observations in reverse order , first we see that for small values of @xmath6 , the promoter activities rise as a power of @xmath6 : @xmath23 . from equations [ eq : mech1_full ] and [ eq :",
    "mech2_full ] we find that this power @xmath24 for mechanism ( 1 ) and @xmath25 for mechanism ( 2 ) .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath26 , mechanism ( 2 ) will have a steeper response at small values of @xmath6 .",
    "next , let us consider the amount of inducer @xmath27 needed to half - activate the promoter under the two mechanisms .",
    "the fact that @xmath21 is close to @xmath9 for @xmath17 is because of the term @xmath13 , which occurs in both the numerator and the denominator of equation [ eq : mech2_partial ] . when @xmath5 is large enough ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) , the operator is rarely free , and the constant term ( = 1 ) in eq .",
    "[ eq : mech2_full ] can be disregarded from both numerator and denominator . in that case",
    "@xmath17 only depends on the ratio between the binding affinities @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly @xmath17 becomes independent of the value of @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "on the other hand , the activity @xmath16 is always highly dependent on @xmath30 . from equation [ eq : mech1_full ]",
    "we see that @xmath16 reaches half - maximum when @xmath32 .",
    "this happens when @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath21 is an increasing function of @xmath5 for mechanism ( 1 ) .",
    "for both mechanisms , when @xmath5 drops below @xmath34 we enter a regime where the inducer is not needed for derepression . for our standard parameters , repressor concentration",
    "@xmath35 implies that @xmath1 and @xmath2 dominate @xmath13 in equation [ eq : mech2_partial ] .",
    "thereby the functional form of the activity @xmath17 approaches that of @xmath16 , as indeed seen from the @xmath36 regime in fig .",
    "in addition to these mathematical arguments , the above observations can be understood physically from the nature of the processes allowed in mechanisms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "consider the case of a fully repressed promoter ( when @xmath37 ) .",
    "mechanism ( 1 ) then requires dissociation of @xmath38 from the operator for the activity to rise and this is associated with a free energy cost proportional to @xmath39 . in mechanism",
    "( 2 ) there is no such cost and therefore a smaller amount of @xmath6 is required to achieve the same level of inhibition of r. thus , for genes which are typically completely repressed , and transcription of which , on the other hand , may be needed suddenly , mechanism ( 1 ) is inferior to mechanism ( 2 ) because it needs a larger amount of @xmath6 .",
    "after first discussing three real systems , we will elaborate on this response advantage by comparing the explicit time dependence of the two mechanisms in the next section .",
    "the most general framework within which the promoter activities of the enzymes in the _ bet _ , _ mer _ and _ lac _ systems can be represented is the following generalization of equations 1 and 2 :    @xmath40    equation [ eq : general_full ] in the methods section shows the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath42 are constants dependent on which system we are trying to describe .",
    "@xmath43 is the promoter activity in the absence of r and is used as a reference ( 1.00 ) . @xmath0 and @xmath44 are the relative promoter activities in the presence of r alone , and r together with s , respectively .",
    "table 1 shows the values of @xmath42 as well as how the binding affinity of r to the operator is changed by the binding of s ( the ratio @xmath29 ) for the three systems .",
    "we have used the hill coefficients @xmath45 ( assuming that two protein subunits are involved in dna binding ) and @xmath46 ( for simplicity and to compare with fig .",
    "[ 3dplot ] . ) mechanism ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are special cases of this equation .",
    "equations [ eq : mech1_partial ] and [ eq : mech1_full ] , for mechanism ( 1 ) , are obtained by setting @xmath47 and taking the limit @xmath48 ( the value of @xmath44 is irrelevant in this limit ) .",
    "equations [ eq : mech2_partial ] and [ eq : mech2_full ] , for mechanism ( 2 ) , are obtained by setting @xmath49 . from table 1 , it is clear then that _ lac _ uses mechanism ( 1 ) and _ bet _ uses mechanism ( 2 ) .",
    "_ mer _ is an even more extreme case of mechanism ( 2 ) where the @xmath13 term has a much larger weight ( @xmath50 ) than the idealized mechanism ( 2 ) .",
    ".values of parameters in equation 3 for three systems found in _",

    ", a representative of mechanism ( 1 ) , indeed behave similar to the idealized versions of the two mechanisms investigated in fig .",
    "[ 3dplot ] .",
    "the difference between _ bet _ and _ mer _ is the result of changes in the binding affinity of r in the absence and presence of s.    a further complication that could occur in real systems is that the probabilities of rna polymerase recruitment could be different for different states of the operator .",
    "we find that taking the changing probabilities of rna polymerase recruitment into account does not change the mathematical form of the equations for the promoter activities ( see methods . )",
    "thus , this additional complication does not affect our results .",
    "+ we now turn to an analysis of differences in the temporal behaviour of the feedback mechanisms .",
    "we model the dynamics by two coupled differential equations :    @xmath51 and @xmath52    @xmath53 and @xmath6 represent the concentrations of the enzyme and signal molecule , respectively .",
    "the first term in the @xmath54 equation is the rate of production of e which is equal to the promoter activity , @xmath41 ( equations [ eq : general_partial ] and [ eq : general_full ] ) .",
    "the second term represents degradation of e. the second equation describes the evolution of the concentration of s ; it increases if there is a source , @xmath55 , of s ( for instance from outside the cell ) and decreases due to the action of the enzyme e. in the first equation both terms could be multiplied by rate constants , representing the rates of transcription , translation and degradation .",
    "however , we have eliminated these constants by measuring time , @xmath56 , in units of the degradation time of e , and by rescaling @xmath53 appropriately ( see the methods section for details . ) thus , in these equations , @xmath53 and @xmath56 are dimensionless , with @xmath53 lying between 0 and 1 .",
    "@xmath57 can then be interpreted as the maximum rate of degradation of s in units of the degradation rate of e.    * a. + * + * b. + *    fig .",
    "[ dynamics]a ( left panel ) shows what happens if the cell is subject to a sudden pulse of s. that is , the source @xmath58 always , but at time @xmath59",
    "the concentration of s abruptly jumps from zero to @xmath60 .",
    "this triggers an increase in the production of e which then starts to decrease the concentration of s. there is no further addition of s to the system , so eventually all of it is removed and the system returns to its condition before the pulse . from the figure we see that , for the same parameter values , mechanism ( 2 ) results in a much faster removal of s because the response of e to the pulse is larger .",
    "the right panel adds further evidence to this conclusion .",
    "it shows , for both mechanisms , perturbed by varying sized pulses of s , the time taken for the concentration of s to fall to @xmath9 .",
    "this measure shows that mechanism ( 2 ) generally responds faster than mechanism ( 1 ) .",
    "the two mechanisms converge for small perturbations because there is no signal to respond to ( levels of @xmath6 are very low ) , and for very large perturbations because then the promoter becomes fully activated by the huge concentration of the inducing molecule s.    fig .",
    "[ dynamics]b shows what happens when the cell is subject to the appearance of a constant source of s. at time @xmath59 the value of @xmath61 abruptly jumps from zero to @xmath60 per degradation time of e. in response , the production of e is increased and eventually reaches a new steady state value to deal with the constant influx of s ( left panel ) . from the right panel of the figure it is evident that mechanism ( 2 ) is able to suppress the amount of s much more than mechanism ( 1 ) for most values of the rate of influx . again , for similar reasons , the two mechanisms converge at small and large values of @xmath61 .",
    "these observations apply for the case when @xmath19 for mechanism ( 2 ) .",
    "the only effect on the dynamical equations caused by changing the ratio @xmath29 lies in the expression for @xmath41 in the first term of the @xmath54 equation . as mentioned in the previous section , changing this ratio mainly results in shifting of the response curve and as @xmath18 is increased , @xmath17 approaches @xmath16 .",
    "for the dynamics this results in an increase in @xmath62 ( for a pulse ) and in the steady state value of @xmath6 ( for a source ) as @xmath29 is increased .",
    "these values approach those for mechanism ( 1 ) in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "the amount by which @xmath18 has to be boosted to effectively reduce mechanism ( 2 ) to mechanism ( 1 ) increases with increasing @xmath5 , as in the steady state case .",
    "+ in the present paper we have discussed various strategies for negative feedback mechanisms involving the action of one signal molecule on a transcription factor . in particular , we have investigated two broadly different ways in which the signal molecule may change the action of the transcription factor : first , it could inhibit its action by sequestering it , and second , it could bind to the transcription factor while it is on the dna site and there alter its action .",
    "the first mechanism occurs when the binding of the signal molecule reduces the affinity of the transcription factor to such an extent that it can not subsequently remain bound to the dna .",
    "this kind of inhibition of the transcription factor occurs in the _ lac _ system , where ( allo)lactose reduces the binding affinity of laci to the operator _",
    "o1 _ by a factor of 1000 @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has also been exploited in synthetic gene networks @xcite . in the second mechanism the binding affinity",
    "is not altered that much ; _ bet _ and _ mer _ belong to this category . in the case of _ mer",
    "_ the presence of the signal molecule reverses the action of the transcription factor , changing it from a repressor to an activator @xcite .    in steady state ,",
    "the two mechanisms differ most when the levels of the transcription factor are large enough to ensure substantial repression in the absence of the signal molecule .",
    "the underlying reason for these differences is that , in this regime of full repression , for each transcription factor that binds to the signal molecule there is , for mechanism ( 1 ) , an extra energy cost for the dissociation of the transcription factor from the dna .",
    "the dynamical behaviour of feedback loops based on mechanisms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) also differ substantially when promoters are in the fully repressed regime .",
    "we have shown that when the systems are perturbed by the sudden appearance of either a pulse or a source of signal molecules , mechanism ( 2 ) is generally faster and more efficient than mechanism ( 1 ) in suppressing the levels of the molecule .",
    "this prediction could be tested using synthetic gene circuits which implement these two mechanisms , for instance by extending the circuits built in ref .",
    "in addition , this observation fits neatly with the fact that the _ bet _ and _ mer _ systems use versions of mechanism ( 2 ) , because they respond to harmful conditions ( osmotic stress and the presence of mercury ions , respectively ) and therefore need to respond quickly , while mechanism ( 1 ) is associated with _",
    "lac _ , a system involved in metabolism of food molecules which therefore does not need to be as sensitive to the concentration of the signal molecules . in the case of _ lac _ it is probably energetically disadvantageous for the cell to respond to low levels of lactose sources @xcite .",
    "the differences between mechanisms are clear when they are compared keeping all parameters constant . in cells ,",
    "however , parameter values vary widely from one system to another which can obscure the differences caused by the two mechanisms . for instance",
    ", it is possible to increase the speed of response of mechanism ( 1 ) by reducing the @xmath9 value ( i.e. , increasing the binding strength between the regulator and the signal molecule . ) keeping all other parameters constant @xmath9 needs to be decreased by a factor 10 for mechanism ( 1 ) to behave the same as mechanism ( 2 ) when @xmath64 .",
    "this factor increases as @xmath5 increases , i.e. , as the repression is more complete .",
    "this can again be understood in terms of the extra energy cost for mechanism ( 1 ) : increasing @xmath9 sufficiently makes the extra energy cost insignificant compared to the r - s binding energy .",
    "thus , a negative feedback loop in a real cell which needs to respond to signals on a given fast timescale could do so either by using mechanism ( 2 ) , or by using mechanism ( 1 ) with a substantially larger r - s binding affinity . for signal molecules where it is not possible for the r - s binding to be arbitrarily strengthened , mechanism ( 2 )",
    "would be the better choice .",
    "on the other hand , mechanism ( 2 ) also has its disadvantages .",
    "for instance , at promoters with complex regulation the dna bound transcription factor using mechanism ( 2 ) may interfere with the action of other transcription factors .    in figure 1",
    "we showed 4 examples , and have extensively discussed example ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "another implementation of mechanism ( 2 ) is example ( iii ) , with an activity @xmath65 $ ] . in general this regulatory module",
    "is at least as efficient as mechanism ( 2 ) , with a dynamical response which is even more efficient in the intermediate range of @xmath6 ( around @xmath9 ) . the loop in fig .",
    "[ schematic](iv ) is , on the other hand , a different kind of negative feedback from the other three examples .",
    "it involves synthesis of the signal molecule , and thus is aimed at maintaining a certain concentration of the molecule , rather then minimising or consuming it . in practice , it is the kind of feedback that is common in biosynthesis pathways , where it helps maintain a certain level of amino acids , nucleotides , etc .",
    ", inside the cell .    the simple one - step",
    ", single - operator negative feedback loops investigated here clearly indicate that the mechanism of action of the signal molecule is a major determinant of the steady state and dynamical behaviour of the loop .",
    "additional complexity in the mechanism of regulation ( e.g. , cooperative binding of a transcription factor to multiple binding sites ) or of the regulatory region ( competing transcription factors or multiple regulators responding to different signals ) @xcite would open up more avenues for the differences between the two mechanisms to manifest themselves .",
    "these feedback loops form the link connecting the genetic and metabolic networks in cells .",
    "in fact , such loops involving signal molecules are likely to be a dominant mechanism of feedback regulation of transcription .",
    "feedback using only regulatory proteins , without signal molecules , is probably too slow because it relies on transcription to change the levels of the proteins .",
    "negative auto - regulation can speed up the response of transcription regulation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , feedback loops based on translation regulation @xcite , active protein degradation @xcite or metabolism of signal molecules will certainly be able to operate on much faster timescales .",
    "this is probably why feedback loops are rare in purely transciptional networks , which has contributed to the view that feed forward loops are dominant motifs in transcription regulation .",
    "taking feedback loops involving signal molecules into account alters this viewpoint substantially . in _",
    "e. coli _ the number of feedforward loops in the transcription regulatory network has been reported to be 40 @xcite . based on data in the ecocyc database @xcite , we know that there are more than 40 negative feedback loops involving signal molecules where the regulation is by a transcription factor . adding this many feedback loops to the genetic network would also change the network topology substantially . in particular , it would diminish the distinction between portions of the network that are downstream and upstream of a given protein .",
    "the effect of this would be to make the network more interconnected and reduce the modularity of the network by increasing the number of links between apparently separate modules .",
    "+       + the operator can exist in one of two states : ( i ) free , @xmath1 , and ( ii ) bound to the regulator , @xmath2 .",

    "<S> + * the molecular network in an organism consists of transcription / translation regulation , protein - protein interactions / modifications and a metabolic network , together forming a system that allows the cell to respond sensibly to the multiple signal molecules that exist in its environment . </S>",
    "<S> a key part of this overall system of molecular regulation is therefore the interface between the genetic and the metabolic network . </S>",
    "<S> a motif that occurs very often at this interface is a negative feedback loop used to regulate the level of the signal molecules . in this work we use mathematical models to investigate the steady state and dynamical behaviour of different negative feedback loops . </S>",
    "<S> we show , in particular , that feedback loops where the signal molecule does not cause the dissociation of the transcription factor from the dna respond faster than loops where the molecule acts by sequestering transcription factors off the dna . </S>",
    "<S> we use three examples , the _ bet _ , _ mer _ and _ lac _ systems in _ e. coli _ , to illustrate the behaviour of such feedback loops . </S>"
