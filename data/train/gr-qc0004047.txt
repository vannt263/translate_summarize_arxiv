    "there have been many topics issued on the quantum mechanics of the neutrino oscillation in the flat spacetime  @xcite and in the curved spacetime @xcite , most of them centered on the understanding of the quantum coherence condition between the various mass - eigenstates , as well as on the calculations of the phase factor in the spacetime .",
    "the mass neutrino oscillation problem is connected basically to the phase difference between different mass - eigenstate , a property intimately related to the basic principles of quantum mechanics . in the standard treatment of the neutrino oscillation",
    ", the condition of same - energy ( same - momentum ) with different momenta ( energies ) of the mass - eigenstates is introduced  @xcite , which arises the same practically applied massive neutrino oscillation phase , however it is indicated that the unambiguous theoretical description of the massive neutrino oscillation phase will be involved in the wave packet formalism and not in the plane wave approximation dod99 .",
    "further , it is shown that the same energy or same momentum description is just the arbitrariness of the choice of the lorentz frame in which it is valid , nothing to do with the physical argument giu01 .",
    "the change of flavors is described by the oscillation length , and it is usually claimed that both conditions ( same - energy and same - momentum ) present practically the same neutrino oscillation results . sometimes , a source - dependent condition is added  @xcite , which implies in giving up either the same - energy or the same - momentum prescription .",
    "this calculation of the neutrino oscillation phase , however , yields the same result of the standard treatment .",
    "furthermore , the velocity difference of the various mass - eigenstates results in a spacetime separation for neutrinos of different flavor  @xcite , which is another source of confusion on the interference condition for the different neutrino . the same velocity description has been paid much attention ak98,leo99,tak00 , but this prescription is pointed out to be forbidden kinematically oku007 . actually , considerable confusion has arisen in the description , interpretation and understanding of the neutrino oscillation , a problem which involves the fundamental principles of both quantum mechanics and special relativity , such as the uncertainty principle , the superposition principle , and simultaneity problems because the mass neutrinos are high energy quantum objects .",
    "moreover it is often noted the factor of 2 of the neutrino phase calculations in the flat spacetime @xcite and in the curved spacetime @xcite , which is believed to be the consideration of the space phase or the time phase @xcite , as well as the arrival time difference of the two mass neutrinos @xcite .    in the minkowski diagram of flat spacetime",
    ", we discuss how the same - energy , the same - momentum of the neutrino phase present the same practical result , and the relation between the arrival time difference and the double counting of the phase , and further , we extend our discussions to the curved spacetime .",
    "we also calculate the phase factor in the case of the same velocity description although this process is not physically realized . here",
    "we stress that all our calculations are based on the plane wave treatment of the neutrino , otherwise the wave packet should be considered giu91 .",
    "we set @xmath2 throughout this article .",
    "in the standard treatment of the neutrino oscillation , if two generations are taken into account , the neutrino flavor - state is written as |_(x , t ) = _ j u_j | _ j , where ( u ) = u_j= (    cc & + - &    ) , with @xmath3 the mixing angle . in vector form , (    c |_e(x , t ) +     ) = ( i * )  u ( *    c |_1 +     ) , where ( ( i * ) ) = ( *    cc ( i _ 1 ) & 0 + 0 & ( i _ 2 )    ) , with @xmath4 the eigenvalue of the phase operator  @xcite _ j = ( e_j dt - p_j dx ) . here ,",
    "flavor ( mass ) indices are expressed by greek ( latin ) letters , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are represented respectively by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath9 comprise the transformation between the flavor and mass basis .",
    "now , we suppose a pure flavor - state electron neutrino @xmath10 is at the initial source position @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "the mass eigenstates are taken to be the eigenstates of energy ( momentum ) .",
    "the momentum ( energy ) then satisfies the mass shell relation = - , [ pe ] where @xmath14 is the rest - mass operator corresponding to the mass eigenvalue @xmath15 of the eigenstate @xmath16",
    "@xcite .",
    "the oscillation probability @xmath17 from flavor @xmath18 at the source position * a * , to flavor @xmath19 at the detector position @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is given by  @xcite , ( _ e _ ) = |_|_e(x , t ) |^2 = ^22  , where = _ 2 - _ 1 is the phase difference between the different mass states .",
    "the oscillation length is defined by taking @xmath22 . from the standard treatment of the neutrino oscillation , the common momentum ( energy ) , and the approximation condition ( [ pe ] ) lead to a phase difference @xmath23 and an oscillation length @xmath24 given respectively by  @xcite = m^2 2e l , and l_osc^s= 2 , where @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . to compute the oscillation probability ,",
    "the following three assumptions are often applied  @xcite : ( @xmath27 ) the mass eigenstates are taken to be the energy ( momentum ) eigenstates , with a common energy ( momentum ) ; ( @xmath28 ) up to @xmath29(@xmath30 ) , we have the approximation @xmath31 ; ( @xmath32 ) a massless trajectory is assumed , which means that the neutrino travels along the null trajectory defined by @xmath33 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the flavor state is simplified as |_(x , t ) = _ j u_j | _ j .",
    "[ ] this state is then used to compute the oscillation amplitude .",
    "in this section , we discuss the standard procedures for the calculation of the phase factor along both the particle world - line and the null trajectory in minkowski spacetime  @xcite .",
    "first , let us recall that , when the null condition is applied , the standard treatment yields ^s = ( edt - pdx ) ( e - p)dx = m^2 2e l . if the null condition @xmath34 is not used , we find = ( edt - pdx ) = dx = m^2 pl 2^s .",
    "the phase difference is then = ( m^2_2 p_2 - m^2_1 p_1 ) l 2^s .    in order to illustrate the problem explicitly",
    ", the original definition of the phase factor will be obtained by means of the interval in the minkowski spacetime . from fig.[figsv ] , we see that the interval of the world line , when the neutrino propagates from @xmath35 to @xmath36 in spacetime , is ds^2(ad ) = ^2 - ^2 = ( + ) = l v^2 - l^2 = l^2 v^2 ^2 , [ ds ] and consequently = m   ds(ad ) = mlv= ( m^2 el)(1v ) 2^s . the standard treatment gives m",
    "ds(ad ) = ( m ds ) - ( m ds ) = ( e - p)= m^2 2el=^s .",
    "[ dsps ] although the difference @xmath37 between the particle world time and the null time is small , the phase is not solely related to the distance in space , but also to the interval in the spacetime , and the phase is sensitive to the null condition when the velocity of the neutrino approaches the speed of light .",
    "if we neglect this small difference in the time interval , a factor of 2 will appear in the phase factor ! to illustrate this conclusion , we inspect in the next subsections the standard treatments in more detail .",
    "if two neutrinos share the same energy ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , but present different momenta , the contribution to the phase difference will come from the integration of the momentum in space because the same - energy condition makes the integration of the energy in time to vanish .",
    "this is the main point of the same - energy condition in the standard treatment .",
    "now , we will explore this point in more detail by using the minkowski diagram of fig.[figdv ] .    for convenience",
    ", we will keep using the convention @xmath40 , which leads to @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the minkowski diagram of fig.[figdv ] , the faster the frame the closer it is of the null line  @xcite .",
    "this property will be helpful for our analysis .    according to the standard treatment in the case of same - energy ( @xmath44 ) , we have [ edps ] ^s & = & _ a^b ( e_2 dt - p_2 dx ) - _ a^b ( e_1 dt - p_1 dx ) + & = & - _ a^b ( p_2 - p_1 ) dx = m^2 2e l .",
    "this computation seems not to use the null condition @xmath45",
    "= @xmath46 , and it does not use the fact that , because the velocities are not the same , the neutrinos with velocities @xmath47 and @xmath48 follow different world - lines .",
    "however , the null condition is in fact used when we replace both @xmath49 and @xmath50 by @xmath51 ( see fig.[figdv ] ) .",
    "it is thus important to remark that it is the null condition , not the same energy condition , that accounts for the cancellation of the time phase .",
    "what does it happen if the real world - lines ( geodesic ) of the neutrinos are taken into account ? in order to answer this question ,",
    "it is important to notice that the massive neutrinos @xmath52 and @xmath53 describe two different world lines from the source * a * to the detector * b * , given respectively by @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see fig.[figdv ] ) . taking this into account",
    ", we obtain : [ edp ] & = & _ a^d_2 ( e_2 dt - p_2dx ) - _ a^d_1 ( e_1 dt - p_1 dx ) + & = & _ d_1^d_2 e dt - _ a^b ( p_2 - p_1 ) dx + & = & m^2 e 2 p_1 p_2 l + m^2 2 e l + & & m^2 2 e l + m^2 2 e l = 2 ^s . if the arrival time - difference of the neutrinos is considered , therefore , the time - phase is not canceled . as it is as large as the space - phase",
    ", the real phase results twice the value yielded by the standard treatment .",
    "a similar conclusion has also been obtained in ref .",
    "the computation of ( [ edps ] ) and ( [ edp ] ) indicates that it is the null condition , not the same energy condition , the responsible for the duplication of the standard phase difference .",
    "following a procedure similar to that used in the case of the same - energy prescription , we examine now the same - momentum prescription ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "we still suppose @xmath40 , which leads to @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath43 .",
    "these relations allow us to use the same minkowski diagram of fig.[figdv ] .",
    "we find in this case [ pdp ] & = & _ a^d_2 ( e_2 dt - p_2 dx ) - _ a^d_1 ( e_1 dt - p_1 dx ) + & = & _ b^d_2 e_2 dt -",
    "_ b^d_1 e_1 dt + & = & m^2 p l 2 ^s .",
    "it is the same result of the case of the same - energy prescription .",
    "however , a small difference exists . in order to show the influence of the same - momentum and of the null - condition on the calculation of the phase difference",
    ", we examine the phase computation of the same - momentum prescription of the standard treatment , but using the null condition .",
    "this amounts to replace @xmath60 and @xmath61 by the null time corresponding to @xmath62 .",
    "we find [ pdps ] ^s & = & _ a^b ( e_2 dt - p_2 dx ) - _ a^b ( e_1 dt - p_1 dx ) + & = & _ b^n e_2 dt - _",
    "b^n e_1 dt + & = & _ b^n ( e_2 - e_1 ) dx = m^2 2p l = ^s .",
    "we see in this way that the same - momentum condition cancels the space phase in both ( [ pdp ] ) and ( [ pdps ] ) . however , the time - phase in ( [ pdp ] ) is twice the value found in ( [ pdps ] ) .",
    "a problem then arises : why do both the same - energy and the same - momentum prescriptions yield the same practical result ?",
    "a possible answer is that the time - phase and the space - phase might be equivalent when the null condition is used , as already concluded in ref .",
    "somehow , the null condition implies in neglecting the arrival time - difference of the two neutrinos . if this is correct , we should get @xmath63 when computing the phase factor under the assumption of the same - velocity prescription , as in this case no arrival time - difference exists",
    "although the same velocity descrition ak98,leo99,tak00 is forbidden by the kinematical consideration oku007 , here , we still explore in the minkowski diagram how it arises the standard oscillation phase .    instead of supposing @xmath64 or @xmath65 ,",
    "let us suppose the same - velocity prescription for the neutrinos motion  @xcite : @xmath47 = @xmath66 ( @xmath67 = @xmath68 ) .",
    "we have in this case = e_2 e_1 = p_2 p_1 , [ veq1 ] and = p_2 e_2 .",
    "[ veq2 ] the phase difference can be computed along the world line shown in fig.[figsv ] .",
    "the result is & = & _ a^d ( e_2 dt - p_2 dx ) - _ a^d ( e_1 dt - p_1 dx ) + & = & _ b^d ( p_2 - p_1 ) v_o ( dx v_o ) - _ a^b(p_2 - p_1 ) dx + & = & ( p_2 - p_1 ) ^2 v_o^2 l = ( p_2 ^ 2 - p_1 ^ 2 ) ^2 v_o^2 ( p_2 + p_1 )",
    "l + & = & m^2 ( p_2 + p_1 ) l ^s .",
    "like the same - energy and the same - momentum prescriptions , the same - velocity prescription gives exactly the value of the standard treatment . we conclude in this way that the confusion on the understanding of the neutrino phase factor has its origin in the arrival - time difference",
    "the null condition of the standard treatment includes the information of the same speed of the two neutrinos .",
    "as discussed in the flat spacetime , calculating the phase along the geodesic will produce a factor of 2 , now we can also obtain this conclusion in the general curved spacetime , not only in the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "the velocity of an extremely relativistic neutrino is nearly the speed of light in the curved spacetime .",
    "although seemingly irrelevant to think about the difference between the geodesic and the null , this tiny deviation becomes important for the understanding of the neutrino oscillation . motivated by this argument , we will compare the neutrino phase when calculated along the geodesic and along the null - line . with this , we will be able to verify the factor of 2 when the null is replaced by the geodesic .",
    "this study can be shown to remain valid in the case of the flat spacetime .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be the tangent vectors to the geodesic and to the null - line , respectively , their difference @xmath71 being a small quantity for the case of an extremely relativistic neutrino . here",
    ", we suppose that the two neutrinos , the massless and massive , start their journey at the same initial spacetime position a , and their _ space _ routes are almost the same .",
    "but , there will be an arrival time - difference at the detector position b. this means that their 4-dimensional spacetime trajectories are not the same , and consequently the tangent vectors will present a small difference .",
    "thus , we have [ nne ] n^ = ^ + ^ , p^ = ^ + m^ , where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the 4-momentum along the geodesic ( null - line ) with ^ = dx^d = d^ds and n^ = dx^ds . in these expressions , @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "are respectively affine parameters along the null and the geodesic lines .",
    "these two tangent vectors satisfy the mass shell relations of the geodesic and the null - line : [ gn ] g _ n^n^ = 1 and [ nn ] g _ ^^ = 0 .",
    "now , substituting ( [ nne ] ) into ( [ gn ] ) , we obtain [ msg2 ] g _",
    "( ^ + ^ ) ( ^ + ^ ) = 1 , or , by using ( [ nn ] ) , [ nne2 ] 2 g _ ^ ^ + o(^2 ) = 1 . we can estimate the order of @xmath76 and @xmath77 by noting that @xmath78 , which implies that @xmath79 , where @xmath80 @xmath81 for a relativistic neutrino .",
    "the neutrino phase induced by the null condition , as in the standard treatment , comes from the 4-momentum @xmath82 defined along the geodesic line , and the tangent vector @xmath83 to the null - line  @xcite .",
    "we notice that , if the 4-momentum @xmath84 defined along the null - line was instead used to compute the null phase , we would obtain zero because of the null condition .",
    "therefore , the phase along the geodesic line ( geodesic phase ) and the phase along the null - line ( null phase ) can be written respectively as  @xcite [ nrpb ] ( geod)= m ds = g_p^n^ds , and ( null ) = g_p^^ds .",
    "therefore , the difference between the geodesic phase and the null phase , by using eq.([nne2 ] ) , is ( geod ) & - & ( null)= g_p^(n^ - ^ ) ds + & = & g_p^ ^ ds = g_^^ ds + o(^2 ) + & = & 12 m ds + o(^2 ) = 12(geod ) + o(^2 ) , that is ( geod ) = 2 ( null ) + o(^2 ) .",
    "this conclusion , valid for a general curved spacetime , is similar to that found in in a schwarzschild  @xcite spacetime . concerning the schwarzschild spacetime , bhattacharya _ et al _  @xcite have the following argument for the factor of 2 . as the neutrino energy is fixed , but the masses are different , if an interference is to be observed at the same final spacetime point b@xmath85 , the relevant components of the wave function could not both have started at the same initial spacetime point a@xmath86 in the semiclassical approximation . instead",
    ", the lighter mass ( hence faster moving ) component must either have started at the same time from a spatial location @xmath87 , or ( what is equivalent ) started from the same location @xmath88 at a later time @xmath89 . hence , there is already an initial phase difference between the two mass components due to this time gap , even before the transport from @xmath88 to @xmath90 which leads to the phase @xmath91 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the additional initial phase difference may be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the same - energy and the same - momentum prescriptions in calculating the mass neutrino interference phase will obtain the same result if the arrival time difference is taken into account , which will be , mathematically , equivalent to the phase of a treatment by using the same - velocity condition .",
    "however , we remark that generally neither energy nor momentum are equal in the factual physical process dod99,giu01 , the standard treatment of the same - energy and the same - momentum prescriptions of massive neutrino phases is just a mathematical simplification in some sense when applying the plane wave approximation",
    ". then our analysis of the massive neutrino standard phases in the minkowski diagram indicates that the same phase factor will be obtained if the two massive neutrinos follow the null line or possess the same velocity .",
    "if the phase calculated along the particle world line , the realtive phase will produce a factor of 2 @xcite , the reason is that we despise the arrival time difference of the two mass neutrinos , which results in a double counting effect .",
    "this conclusion is correct in both flat spacetime and the curved spacetime .",
    "further , for the better understanding of the mass neutrino interference , we should consider the neutrino mixing state as a wave - packet dod99,giu91 , or a relativistic quantum ball . according to this scheme",
    ", two physical aspects must be considered .",
    "on one hand , there is the classical trajectory of the ball which is defined by giving the initial conditions in the classical sense .",
    "this motion is relativistic , leading thus to the relativity of the simultaneity as the velocities of the different mass neutrinos are not the same . the classical trajectory ,",
    "therefore , is defined in terms of macroscopic quantities of the packet , the quantum average of quantities , in accordance with the correspondence principle of quantum mechanics . in the classical sense , the average mass and velocity of the packet ball",
    "define its orbit .",
    "the distance from the source to the detector is usually measured accurately , which is a classical measurement with a macroscopic precision . on the other hand",
    ", there is the quantum dynamics of the packet , which is a two - state system like a neutral kaon or a b meson .",
    "this fuzzy dynamics takes place in the microscopic scale @xmath92 , the characteristic dimension of the ball , which is small compared to the dimension @xmath93 of the macroscopic trajectory .",
    "this quantum dynamics , that is , the internal evolution of the packet , is well described and understood in the particle physics context .",
    "as a final comment , we would like to argue that , if the individual mass - eigenstate is supposed to have a well defined classical velocity , its orbit would be well defined at any spacetime position .",
    "this , however , is not in accordance with the quantum interference description , which consequently would never occur .",
    "this means that the quantum fuzzy is necessary for the wave - packet , a well defined orbit being valid only for the classical ( macroscopic ) quantum average .",
    "according to this point of view , two basic points concerns the description of the neutrino oscillation . for the kinematics , we use the plane - wave description with a lorentz invariant phase . for the dynamics",
    ", we use the wave - packet and fuzzy quantum path .",
    "we use , therefore , two concepts for the neutrinos , particle and wave , classical and quantum .",
    "the neutrino is described in terms of a spinor wave - packet , and the spacetime translation induces the spinor to precess in the state vector - space . in other words ,",
    "we take the mixing state as a classical object propagating along the classical world - line with a well defined velocity  the group velocity .",
    "the individual mass - eigenstates propagate with a phase velocity , and only the relative phase velocity will produce the realistic interference phenomenon .",
