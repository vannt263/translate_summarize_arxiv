    "during mitosis , pole spacing is regulated by a system of interpolar microtubules .",
    "it has been proposed that the interpolar microtubules can be moved in two directions by opposing motors , but the details of such a proposed system are not yet well known .",
    "the interpolar microtubules are likely bundled and moved by two families of kinesin motor proteins ; kinesin-5 and kinesin-14 .",
    "experiments with _ drosophila melanogaster _ suggest that a kinesin-5 motor protein , klp61f , plays a large role in creating the spindle during prometaphase @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that kinesin-5 forms cross - bridges between interpolar microtubules in the centralspindlin @xcite .",
    "further experiments suggest the same motor drives the separation of the poles during metaphase and anaphase @xcite . in vitro experiments",
    "show that klp61f slides antiparallel microtubules apart on motility assays , where motor proteins are bound to glass slides and move microtubules that are added to the solution @xcite .",
    "all of the above results show that kinesin-5 plays an important role in controlling the spindle spacing .",
    "being a tetramer with both dimers at the n - terminus , the motor can walk toward the plus ends of two antiparallel microtubules , thus forcing the poles apart .",
    "+ the kinesin-5 are antagonized by the kinesin-14 , which walk toward the minus end of the microtubules . in vitro experiments",
    "show a kinesin-14 , ncd , is capable of bundling microtubules and driving an inward sliding of the interpolar microtubules @xcite . with one motor able to separate the poles , and one able to bring them closer",
    ", it seems possible that the two motors are responsible for maintaining spindle spacing and moving the poles apart .",
    "the net force exerted by the two motor species could govern the direction and rate of pole movement .",
    "recently , work has been done in trying to understand how outward microtubule sliding generated by the kinesin-5 and inward sliding generated by the kinesin-14 could result in the stable , steady - state spindle spacing during prometaphase .",
    "a balance of forces could result in a stationary spindle , but it is unclear how the  collective antagonism \" could occur @xcite . in the following section , we will discuss one group s proposed solution to the problem .      experiments with in vitro motility assays were performed to see if klp61f and ncd could interact to control the speed and polarity of microtubules motility and whether the antagonism between the motors could stall microtubule sliding enough to produce the stable steady - state spindle spacing observed during prometaphase @xcite . before combining both motors in an assay ,",
    "each motor was observed moving microtubules in motility assays as expected .",
    "klp61f moved microtubules at @xmath0 with the minus ends leading and ncd moved microtubules at @xmath1 with the plus ends leading @xcite .",
    "further experiments also showed that klp61f alone , ncd alone , and mixtures of the two motors bundled microtubules under conditions with physiological atp concentrations @xcite .",
    "so see how the two species of motors would interact , different molar ratios of klp61f and ncd were mixed and microtubule motility was measured .",
    "a balance point at a mole fraction of 0.7 ncd was found where microtubules displayed a mean velocity of approximately zero @xcite . for greater mole fractions of ncd ,",
    "the mean velocity was plus end directed .",
    "conversely , for smaller mole fractions of ncd , the mean velocity was minus end directed , as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "the slope of the lines fit to the two sides of the balance point in this figure suggests that klp61f is a strong , slow motor that is not slowed down easily by the weak , fast ncd motor , which in turn is slowed down easily by klp61f @xcite . at the balance point , the microtubules where observed to display oscillatory motion between klp61f and ncd directed movement with intermediate rates of roughly 0.02 @xmath2 m/s , as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that klp61f and ncd motors could act synchronously to antagonize one another .",
    "however , being an inherently stochastic process , it is hard to see how motor power stroking could become synchronized .",
    "in later work  @xcite a fully stochastic model with many parameters was devised and tested numerically .",
    "@xcite had suggested that the microtubules could be gliding on a spatially varying landscape , with varying densities of klp61f and ncd motors @xcite .",
    "periods of directional movement would be due to the patches in the environment where one motor is dominant .",
    "it is possible the microtubule finds a  valley \" in the landscape where it oscillates between patches of motors that move it back towards the balance point .",
    "it is this theory that we will attempt to model in the following section .",
    "we show that the phenomenon is quite general and independent of the details in the parameters .",
    "if the system is rescaled to be dimensionless in length and time , we find that the behavior is only controlled by one parameter ; the effective  temperature \" of the system . a detailed understanding of the motors will only change this effective temperature and nothing else , since scaling laws for spatio - temporal fluctuations are universal .",
    "a study from this perspective also elucidates other aspects of this system , such as the nature of initial transients in motion of the microtubules in these assays before they reach a quasi - steady state .",
    "these transients have interesting implications , as we show that they also should occur for interpolar microtubules during metaphase .",
    "relative to the plate . ,",
    "width=384 ]    we first consider the problem of a single molecular motor , such as kinesin , with the tail tethered to a substrate such as a glass plate while the heads can freely interact with a long microtubule , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlemotor ] .",
    "the microtubule is being moved along a single dimension at uniform velocity @xmath3 that is parallel to the glass .",
    "the heads bind and unbind with the microtubule , applying an average net force @xmath4 , that will depend on @xmath3 .",
    "the averaging is being done over time , and we considering the limit where the time interval goes to infinity .    now consider a collection of @xmath5 identical motors that all interact with the same microtubule but are sufficiently distant from each other that they can be considered independent .",
    "then the average force acting on the microtubule due to these motors is @xmath6 .",
    "the above analysis is easily extended to the case of two separate species of antagonistic motors , labeled @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with average force versus velocity curves @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsv ] .",
    "if the number of motors of each kind is @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then the time averaged force is @xmath13 , where we have adopted a sign convention so that the net force is a difference , rather than a sum . if we choose the ratio @xmath14 , then this net average force vanishes at @xmath15 .",
    "this is the  balance point \" where there is no net average force acting on the microtubule .",
    "the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , weighted in this way is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsv ] .     and",
    "@xmath17,for two species of motors , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , that act to antagonize each other .",
    "the weighted difference between these two curves , is @xmath19 , with relative concentrations chosen so that they are at the balance point , so that @xmath20 for @xmath15 .",
    ", width=384 ]    note that at small velocities at the balance point , fig .",
    "[ fig : fvsv ] , the net effect of these motors , due to the linear relationship between force and velocity in this regime , is , on average , to give linear drag .",
    "this linearity breaks down at high velocities , but , as we will see below , we are interested in the low velocity regime . in this case",
    "the net force @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath19 so that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the drag coefficient .",
    "note that if we are not interested in small velocities , there are other phenomena that can take place that can potentially invalidate this analysis . for large enough velocities ,",
    "the assumption of a fixed force versus velocity curve can sometimes fail  @xcite .",
    "some molecular motors at an individual level , are capable of being in two internal states which can be metastable .",
    "these two states have different characteristics , and on average , apply their net force in opposite directions .",
    "the relative prevalence of the two states depend on the microtubule velocity .",
    "if many such motors are simultaneously attached to a microtubule , and allowed to pull it freely , this can lead to the microtubule moving in one direction for a long time and then occassionally , due to the collective fluctuation of all the motors , reversing its direction of motion .",
    "for the problem under discussion here , the two motors are known to be antagonistic and are assumed to be near the balance point , so that the average velocity is very small , and we are therefore justified in taking a time average over very long times , which will then give rise to a single @xmath4 versus @xmath3 curve .",
    "therefore we believe that the above behavior is not relevant to our particular case , although it is possible that it could become so , for mixtures of other kinds of motors , and therefore deserves further study .",
    "the above analysis is important for two reasons .",
    "first , it relates precisely the force versus velocity curve for assays containing a motor mixture at arbitrary concentration to the behavior of single motor assays .",
    "empirical data on single motor assays can be obtained and then used to understand average properties of these mixed systems .",
    "second , it shows that at the balance point there is only one parameter that need be characterized in order to understand observations ; the drag coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "now that we have understood the behavior of the average force , we shall turn our attention to the effects of spatio - temporal fluctuations on the motion of microtubules . as we shall see , these fluctuations are crucial to understanding the system s behavior .",
    "we will consider a system at the balance point , where the concentration of the two antagonistic motors has been adjusted as mentioned above , so that the average force on a microtubule is zero .",
    "however even at this point , the time averaged force acting on a mictrotubule will depend on its location .",
    "this is because the motors are positioned randomly , so that there are fluctuations in the net force .",
    "if on average , the number of motors acting on a microtubule is @xmath5 , then we expect this fluctuating time averaged force to have an amplitude that varies proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "this time averaged force will vary slowly as a function of position .",
    "if the microtubule is moved only slightly , most of the same motors will still act upon it , meaning that the force will be highly correlated with its original value .",
    "the microtubule has to move its entire length before this time averaged force becomes completely independent of its initial value .    aside from this time",
    "averaged force that is position dependent , we can consider a fixed position and ask how the force varies with time .",
    "there will be a substantial variation in the force as a function of time due to the random binding and unbinding of motor ends to the microtubule .",
    "because these events are uncorrelated between motors , the amplitude of these fluctuation will also vary proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "the above considerations imply that there are two parts to the force exerted on the microtubule , a spatially varying component @xmath25 , and a temporal component @xmath26 . for a fixed microtubule ,",
    "the total force is the sum of these two terms .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are independent of each other because , for a long microtubule , @xmath27 is the sum of many independent components and therefore its amplitude is independent of position    if we now consider a microtubule that is no longer fixed in position , there is a further force due to the drag , as discussed above .    with these three physical effects",
    "included , we are now in a position to model this problem more precisely by characterizing the statistical properties of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , as we now discuss .      both in a cell and in the experiments , the two motor proteins and microtubules are mixed together in a solution . to model this simply and in one dimension , we imagine a railroad track with motor proteins randomly placed at every tie .",
    "this creates a random environment .",
    "a rigid microtubule of length @xmath29 , is placed on the tracks , and the motors that lie underneath randomly exert a force on the microtubule . with both species of motors randomly exerting forces on the microtubule in opposing directions , the microtubule undergoes random movement on the track given by @xmath30 where @xmath25 is the random static force , @xmath26 is the time fluctuating force , and @xmath23 is the drag coefficient , as discussed above .",
    "the left hand side contains @xmath31 , which is the velocity of the center of mass of the microtubule .",
    "[ eqn : rwre ] is generally known as a random walk in a random environment @xcite .",
    "the difference between this and previous work lies in the correlations in @xmath25 , which as noted above , is correlated over the length of a microtubule .",
    "below , we will analyze this equation as follows : the random force @xmath26 gives an effective temperature for this system . by calculating the statistics of the force the motors exert on the microtubule",
    ", this temperature can be determined . by calculating the statistics of @xmath25",
    ", we will know how potential correlations behave for length scales much less than @xmath29 .",

    ", we can make estimates about the oscillatory behavior seen in antagonistic gliding assays .",
    "one railroad tie will by occupied by either a klp61f or ncd motor .",
    "if we measure the force the motor exerts over a time much longer than that motor s cycle , we will see an average force @xmath32 for one klp61f motor , or @xmath33 for one ncd motor , where @xmath34 . because the motor exerts a peak force for some time and",

    "the question we are addressing here is : are the fluctuations due to @xmath26 small enough to confine the microtubule to a certain region ?",
    "in this section , for simplicity we chose our coordinate system so that @xmath53 .",
    "because the force , and therefore the potential , is finite everywhere , and the statistics of the force are translationally invariant , the microtubule can not be localized to any one region and is expected to eventually move arbitrarily far from an initial point .",

    "@xmath143 starts of negative , close to @xmath125 , meaning that near the tip of the microtubules , the motors have the net effect of pulling each other closer together . at some point",
    "the sign of @xmath143 changes and motors in that region predominantly pull the microtubules apart .",
    "the net force due to all the motors as a function of overlap , @xmath25 is obtained by integrating @xmath143 .",
    "the equilibrium overlap @xmath51 is when @xmath136 . by adjusting the profile of motor concentrations",
    ", @xmath51 can be shifted .",
    "one caveat that should be mentioned is that if the motor concentration gradients are too weak , then the microtubules will become stuck due to the randomly fluctuating force . without a strong enough bias due to motor concentration variation , the extremely jagged random environment will prevent microtubules from sliding to the equilibrium point @xmath51 .",
    "we now consider the minimum size of this concentration variation necessary to overcome the random static forces .",
    "the force in fig .",
    "[ fig : force ] is linear around the equilibrium point @xmath51 , and is of the form of hooke s law : @xmath146 , where @xmath120 is measured relative to @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum value that @xmath147 can take can be determined by the extreme case where the force on the microtubule changes from @xmath148 to @xmath149 within one motor spacing @xmath64 . if this change occurs over a width of @xmath27 motors instead , we can write @xmath150 .",
    "we wish to determine the maximum value of @xmath27 that is consistent with the microtubules being able to slide relative to each other .",
    "the potential corresponding to hooke s law is @xmath151 .",
    "compared with the statistics of the random potential , eq .",
    "[ eqn : barrier ] , where @xmath152 , we see that for small enough @xmath120 , the random force dominates , but when @xmath120 becomes sufficiently large , hooke s law prevails .",
    "if the crossover occurs at too large a value of @xmath120 , then the system will become trapped in some local random minimum and not be able to move closer to @xmath51 . to determine this crossover , we equate the standard deviation of the fluctuation in the random potential , given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : barrier ] , with the hookean potential . in terms of @xmath153",
    ", we obtain @xmath154 where the force variance @xmath155 is given in eq .",
    "[ eq : c ] . to estimate the value of @xmath27 , we take @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "this gives @xmath158 .",
    "experimentally in a gliding assay , it was found that the fluctuations in @xmath54 where approximately 4 .",
    "this means that we expect that @xmath27 should be in the range 2 to 3 , in order for the microtubules to slide within the experimental time scale .",
    "this small value of @xmath27 is consistent with the fact that at the balance point , the fluctuations in position of a microtubule in a gliding assay are small .",
    "the spacing between motors , in these assays , is presumably not identical to interpolar microtubules in the spindle but they are believed to be plausibly similar  @xcite .",
    "by means of a fairly general analysis , making few assumptions , we have seen that the motion of microtubules in an antagonistic motility assay near the balance point , is well described by a random walk in a random environment,@xcite but with large correlations in the static random force .",
    "the connection does not depend on a detailed model of the motors .",
    "the force velocity curves of the motors near the stall point , @xmath15 , only come into play to give a drag coefficient for the microtubule .",
    "the results found are in reasonable agreement with the fluctuations observed in microtubule positions seen in experiments  @xcite .",
    "however the model also predicts that the microtubule will slide of order their own distance before getting badly trapped .",
    "there is substantial similarity between these gliding assay experiments and models for what occurs _ in vivo _ during prometaphase , with klp61f and ncd motors antagonizing each other in mitotic spindles  @xcite .",
    "however we point out that although their model correcly predicts that these motors will act to inhibit variations in spindle length , they also do so imperfectly .",
    "antiparallel interpolar microtubules will have initial transients where they slide of order their own length , or sometimes completely disassociate .",
    "it appears that such variations are within the error bars of experimental observation however .",
    "but , to circumvent these fluctuations , it is possible that the cell sets up a gradient of motors during prometaphase , thereby restricting the mitotic spindle to oscillatory movements in a potential well .",
    "further observations of the densities of motors _ in vivo _ could lend a great deal to further understanding of this situation .",
