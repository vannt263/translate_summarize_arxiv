    "an understanding of the processes that affect the formation , evolution , and sometimes destruction of dwarf galaxies is critical to our overall picture of galaxy formation .",
    "since dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxy in the universe , any model of galaxy formation is incomplete if we can not understand these objects .",
    "moreover , under the current paradigm of hierarchical structure formation @xcite , massive galaxies are formed from the mergers of less massive objects .",
    "thus , dwarf galaxies are an important building block of the universe , and an understanding of their properties will help illuminate the processes of galaxy formation more generally .",
    "the faintest examples of dwarf galaxies are the dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) . using the nomenclature of @xcite ,",
    "these are low - luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , low central surface brightness ( @xmath8  mag arcsec@xmath9 ) objects with shallow radial profiles and stellar populations that are dominated by old and intermediate - aged stars galaxy sequence , and when we note de galaxies we are including those gas - poor dwarf galaxies more luminous than @xmath10 .",
    "most of what we know about dsphs comes from observations of @xmath11  galaxies in the low - density environment of the local group . from the data",
    ", it appears that dsphs are fairly homogeneous in nature , with small , but dense dark matter halos and low metallicities that are in proportion to their luminosity ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "much less is known about dsphs in the cluster environment .",
    "surveys in virgo and fornax have successfully found large numbers of de and bright dsph galaxies @xcite , but there is still considerable uncertainty in just how many of these lowest - luminosity objects exist @xcite .",
    "the scarce information we do have on cluster dsph galaxies suggests that their properties are similar to those of local group dwarfs @xcite .",
    "if correct , then such a result is somewhat surprising , since the tidal forces of the cluster environment are expected to take their toll on these objects .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that dsphs can be stripped of their outer stars in only a few gyr .",
    "this would imply that both the morphology and chemistry of cluster dsphs should differ significantly from their local group counterparts .    until recently ,",
    "abundance studies of cluster dsph galaxies ( based on photometry of individual stars ) have been impractical .",
    "for example , although @xcite were able to resolve the brightest red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in a virgo cluster de , n galaxy using a 32  ks exposure with the _ hubble space telescope s wfpc2 _ camera , these data were limited to a single filter ( f814w ) .",
    "however , with the advent of the _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , _ it is now possible to measure the broad - band colors of red giants in these systems .",
    "indeed , @xcite has recently used the _",
    "acs _ to resolve the stellar populations of four de / dsph galaxies in the virgo cluster , and obtain color - magnitude diagrams of their stars down to @xmath12 , making it the deepest study of individual stars in cluster dwarf galaxies .",
    "their data appear to confirm that the de / dsph galaxies of virgo obey the same luminosity - metallicity relation as the de / dsph galaxies of the local group .    here",
    ", we present an extremely deep f606w and f814w study of a faint ( @xmath13 ) dsph that was serendipitously found during a survey of intracluster stars in virgo @xcite .",
    "we use the data , which reach @xmath14 , to show that the galaxy is remarkably similar to undisturbed dsphs in the local group , both in morphology , and in stellar content . in section  2 , we describe both our data reductions and our artificial star experiments , and present a color - magnitude diagram of the dsph s red giant branch stars . in section  3 , we use these data to derive the system s distance as well as its stellar population .",
    "we show that the galaxy has a mean metallicity that is very low ( [ m / h ] @xmath15 ) , and is composed entirely of stars older than 8 to 10  gyr .",
    "we also derive the galaxy s structural parameters , and show that its central surface brightness and core radius are typical of dsphs in the local group . in section  4 , we compare the galaxy s properties to those of local group objects , and attempt to investigate the effects of environment on its history .",
    "we show that the galaxy displays no obvious evidence of tidal disruption , and has a mean metallicity appropriate for its luminosity .",
    "we conclude by considering the possible origin of this object .",
    "between 30 may 2005 and 7 june 2005 we used the _ advanced camera for surveys _ on the _ hubble space telescope _ to obtain deep f606w and f814w images of a virgo intracluster field ( @xmath1612:28:10.80 , @xmath1712:33:20.0 , orientation 112.58 degrees ) .",
    "this field , which is projected @xmath18  kpc from m87 ( assuming a mean virgo distance @xmath19 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was chosen to be near the cluster center , but away from any known object : the closest cataloged galaxy is the dwarf elliptical vcc  1051 , which is @xmath20 ( 24  kpc ) to the northwest ; the nearest large galaxy , m86 , is over 170  kpc away .",
    "our f814w ( @xmath21-band ) data consisted of 22 exposures , with 26880  s of integration time ; the f606w ( wide @xmath22-band ) observation included 52 exposures totaling 63440  s. these data were co - added , and re - sampled using the multidrizzle task within pyraf @xcite to produce images with @xmath23  pixel@xmath24 .",
    "the details of these reductions , and an image of the field illustrating its position in the cluster is given by @xcite .",
    "immediately after data acquisition , an inspection of our images revealed the presence of a previously unknown galaxy in the field .",
    "the object , whose center is located at @xmath1612:28:15.5 , @xmath25 + 12:33:37.0 ( uncertainty @xmath26 ) is @xmath27 in extent and clearly resolved into stars .",
    "a color image of the object is shown in figure  [ image ] .",
    "our point source photometry was similar ( but not identical to ) that performed by @xcite . to avoid",
    "dealing with variations in the _ acs _ point spread function ( psf ) , we began by limiting our photometric reductions to a @xmath28 pixel ( @xmath29 ) region surrounding the galaxy .",
    "we then chose three bright , isolated stars on our f606w image , and four bright isolated stars on the f814w image to define the psfs , and used daophot  ii and allstar to perform the photometry @xcite .",
    "two daophot  ii / allstar passes were performed to detect as many of the stars as possible .",
    "the f606w and f814w datasets were then merged with a 1.5 pixel matching criterion to create a preliminary object catalog of @xmath30  objects .",
    "finally , we used the daophot @xmath31 and @xmath32 image parameters to remove background galaxies and severely blended stars from the list @xcite .",
    "our instrumental magnitudes were placed on the vegamag system using the prescription and zero points provided by @xcite . to obtain the offset between our allstar magnitudes and the vegamag system",
    ", we used the profiles of the psf stars on each image ; the rms scatter in this calibration was @xmath33  mag .",
    "we note that since the region under consideration is small ( only @xmath34 of the entire _ acs _ field ) , differential effects associated with charge transfer efficiency were negligible ( @xmath35  mag ) , and were ignored .      to ascertain the photometric uncertainties and incompleteness in our data , we used the traditional method of adding simulated stars of known brightness to the science frames and re - reducing them following the exact same procedures as for the original data . to each frame , we added 9000 stars ( 300 runs with 30 stars added per run ) to an elliptical region centered on the dwarf galaxy , and re - executed our two - pass daophot ii / allstar photometric procedure , including the rejection of non - stellar sources , and the merging of the datasets . by limiting the number of fake stars to 30 per run , we did not significantly alter the crowding conditions on the images ; by defining the mean f606w@xmath36f814w color of our artificial stars to be roughly equal to that of the observed objects ( f606w@xmath36f814w = 1.0 ) , we ensured that our experiments adequately reproduced losses during the catalog merging and image classification processes .",
    "finally , by defining the stars luminosity function to be a rising exponential between f814w = 22 and f814w = 29 , we improved our statistics at the faint end of the luminosity function , where the uncertainties are largest .",
    "the result of these experiments were the photometric completeness function @xmath37 , defined as the ratio of the stars recovered to stars added _ regardless of the magnitude that was actually measured , _",
    "@xmath38 , the mean shift in magnitude of the stars ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 , the dispersion about this mean .",
    "all of these functions were computed in 0.5  mag bins , to ease the computational requirements .    to ascertain each filter s limiting magnitude ( defined as the 50% completeness fraction )",
    ", we performed similar artificial star tests using a variety of f606w@xmath36f814w input colors .",
    "the results from these experiments are illustrated in figure  [ completeness ] . from these experiments",
    ", we obtained @xmath41 in f606w and @xmath42 in f814w , where the errors reflect both the rms scatter due to the use of different colors , and the uncertainty associated with varying levels of crowding within the galaxy .",
    "as expected , these limits are slightly brighter than those found by @xcite , whose analysis focused on the uncrowded regions of the frame .",
    "moreover , our classification criteria kept only those objects with the best photometric accuracy : obvious galaxies and extremely blended objects were removed from the catalog .",
    "as result , even at f814w = 27 , @xmath43 of the artificial stars were not recovered .",
    "fortunately , since we are not making any inferences based solely on the absolute number of stars detected , these missing objects do not affect our analyses in any significant way .    a color - magnitude diagram for our artificial stars is shown in figure  [ fakestars ] .",
    "the figure illustrates that the photometric errors increase with magnitude , so that by @xmath44 , the uncertainties are @xmath45  mag .",
    "the figure also shows that there is a small blueward shift at faintest levels ; this is due to the uneven depth of the two images .",
    "( at the faintest levels , our f814w photometry only detects objects whose photometric errors are in the positive direction . ) fortunately , down to the limiting magnitudes of the frames , this color shift is @xmath46  mag .",
    "these corrections , while small , will be accounted for in the following sections .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for all the stellar objects in our field is displayed in the left - hand panel of figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the diagram shows that most objects lie in a sequence near f606w@xmath36f814w @xmath47 that extends up to f814w @xmath48 .",
    "however , there is a significant amount of scatter about this line .",
    "this scatter comes from two sources : the rgb stars that pervade virgo s intracluster space @xcite , and , to a lesser extent , unresolved background galaxies . to minimize the effects of these contaminants",
    ", we identified a subsample of stars within the galaxy s",
    "f814w @xmath49  mag  arcsec@xmath9 isophote .",
    "this subsample , which is defined via an ellipse with semi - major axis @xmath50 , an axis ratio of @xmath51 , and a position angle of @xmath52 ( see section 3.4 ) should have minimal contamination : based on star counts in the rest of our field , only @xmath53 out of the 171 objects brighter than @xmath54 should be contaminants .",
    "thus , we can use the data from this 103  arcsec@xmath55 region to form a `` clean '' color - magnitude diagram of the galaxy s stars .",
    "the elliptical region which defines our subsample is shown in figure  [ image ] ; the right - hand panel of figure  [ cmd ] shows its cmd .",
    "the cmd in figure  [ cmd ] displays the hallmarks of a red - giant branch population with f814w @xmath56 .",
    "there are few stars brighter than this limit , and no evidence of any bright blue stars arising from a young stellar population .",
    "since the data clearly extend more than 1  mag down the rgb , we can use the diagram to investigate both the distance and metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) in the @xmath21-band has repeatedly been shown to be an excellent distance indicator for old , metal - poor populations . in stellar systems with [ m / h ] @xmath57 ,",
    "the trgb is essentially independent of both age and metallicity @xcite , so all that is required is a measure of the bright - end truncation of the rgb and an estimate of foreground reddening ( @xmath58 ; * ? ? ?",
    "our only limitation is the small size of the galaxy , which restricts the number of stars available for analysis .",
    "although foreground / background contamination in our ` dwarf - only ' cmd ( right panel of figure  [ cmd ] ) is small , to make our trgb detection as unambiguous as possible we have further restricted our sample to objects with f606w@xmath36f814w @xmath59 .",
    "stars redder than this are not on the metal - poor rgb and are unlikely to be members of the galaxy .",
    "this makes very little difference to the analysis , since it excludes only 3 objects from consideration .",
    "moreover , since the rgb tip for red , metal - rich stars is fainter than that for blue objects , eliminating these stars should not affect our distance determination .",
    "we note that the _ acs _ f814w filter bandpass is very similar to that of the traditional @xmath21-band : according to @xcite , the transformation between these two systems is @xmath60 ( for stars with f606w@xmath36f814w=1 ) in the vegamag system",
    ".    visual inspection of the figure  [ cmd ] shows a rather sharp transition at f814w @xmath61 , albeit with a small number of stars . while the increased poissonian noise from small numbers can lead to a possible systematic bias in @xmath62 , @xcite",
    "have shown that with at least @xmath63 stars in the top magnitude of the rgb , such biases are small . since our analysis includes @xmath64  objects , we are safely above this threshold .    another possible source of systematic error is image crowding : in dense fields , stellar blends can make the rgb tip appear brighter than it should be .",
    "however , in our case , this effect should not be important .",
    "our artificial star experiments demonstrate that the mean magnitude shift at f814w @xmath65 is very small , less than 0.01  mag .",
    "this result , which is confirmed by additional artificial star experiments with f814w @xmath66 , is due principally to our image classification criteria , which rejects the most heavily blended objects (  those most likely to bias the results towards brighter magnitudes ) .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the rgb tip location can be derived using the sobel edge - detection filter of @xcite .",
    "this technique , which was originally used on binned functions , has since been modified to work on discrete stellar samples by treating each object as a gaussian distribution with a dispersion equal to the expected photometric error @xcite .",
    "we note that more rigorous techniques have been employed to derive @xmath62 , such as the method of maximum - likelihood @xcite , and the second derivative of the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "however , maximum - likelihood methods are better for datasets where the rgb power - law slope is observed for over a magnitude . in our case ,",
    "photometric incompleteness and image crowding make the use of the technique problematic .",
    "moreover , the small number of stars limits the reliability of second derivative calculations .",
    "because our background contamination is so small , the simpler sobel edge - detection filter should be adequate for our purpose .    to employ the sobel - edge detection method",
    ", we treated each star as a gaussian distribution with a mean equal to its observed magnitude ( plus the small @xmath67 shift predicted by our artificial star experiments ) , and a dispersion , @xmath40 , equal to the photometric uncertainty at that magnitude .",
    "we then co - added the gaussians , to produce the luminosity function shown in the top panel of figure  [ sobel ] .",
    "even with the large photometric errors ( @xmath68 at f814w = 27 ) , the sharp rise of the luminosity function is evident , as is a small contribution from brighter stars , which presumably arise from the galaxy s agb component ( more on this below ) .    to determine the location of the tip of the red giant branch , we applied to our continuous luminosity function the edge - detection algorithm @xmath69 where @xmath40 is the photometric error defined via our artificial star experiments @xcite .",
    "this function , which is displayed in the bottom panel of figure  [ sobel ] , reveals a rather wide peak near f814w @xmath70 . from the figure ,",
    "the location of the rgb discontinuity is at @xmath71 , where the uncertainty is based on the full - width - half - maximum of the distribution .",
    "this error is likely conservative @xcite , though it is similar to that expected based on the number of stars available @xcite .    to derive the distance to the dwarf",
    ", we adopt @xmath72 ( random error ) as the absolute magnitude of the metal - poor rgb tip @xcite .",
    "this number is very similar to that of other recent determinations : the empirical calibration of @xcite yields @xmath73 for objects with [ fe / h]@xmath74 , while a more recent determination by @xcite gives @xmath75 for [ fe / h]@xmath76 . (",
    "the metallicity dependence of @xmath77 over this range is much smaller than these random errors . )",
    "thus we derive @xmath78 for the dwarf . assuming a foreground reddening of @xmath58 @xcite ( and thus @xmath79 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we derive a distance modulus of @xmath5 , or @xmath80  mpc ( random error only ) .",
    "this distance is similar to the cepheid , surface brightness fluctuation , and planetary nebula luminosity function distances to the core of virgo @xcite .",
    "although the three - dimensional structure of the virgo cluster is complex , the line - of - sight depth of the virgo core ( as defined by the early - type galaxies ) surrounding m87 is at least @xmath81 mpc @xcite , and the distance to the object is consistent with being located near the center of the cluster .",
    "as noted earlier , much of the color spread in the dsph s rgb is due to photometric errors .",
    "thus , to measure metallicity , our approach was to derive a _",
    "abundance for the galaxy , and then attribute any additional scatter on the rgb to a dispersion in metallicity . since the preceding analysis has shown that the galaxy contains no significant agb population ( also see section 3.4 ) , we can ignore the alternative that the color spread is due to the presence of young or intermediate - age stars .    to derive the mean metallicity of the dsph galaxy ,",
    "we compared the ridge line derived from the cmd in figure  [ cmd ] with the scaled - solar abundance isochrones of @xcite , which are the padova isochrones @xcite transformed directly to the _ acs / wfc _ filter system .",
    "in addition , we have also used the observed fiducial sequences from @xcite , which are derived from photometry of milky way clusters covering a wide range in metallicity .",
    "figure  [ ridgeline ] compares the @xcite 12.5  gyr sequence ( shifted by @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) to the observed colors of the galaxy s rgb stars , both with and without the @xmath67 magnitude shifts predicted by our artificial star experiments .",
    "also shown for comparison is the m92 fiducial sequence of @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", this cluster has an [ fe / h ] value of @xmath84 , but is enhanced in @xmath85-process elements by [ @xmath85/fe ] @xmath86 , thus implying @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , its position in the color - magnitude diagram is consistent with the @xmath88 scaled - solar padova isochrone .",
    "as figure  [ ridgeline ] illustrates , the dsph galaxy is extremely metal - poor : the colors of its rgb stars are bluer than the metal - poor m92 fiducial and very near the @xmath89 padova isochrone . for a more quantitative estimate",
    ", we can use the mean color of the rgb at f814w @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 at the distance of the dwarf ) and interpolate in the padova models ; this particular magnitude was chosen to be deep enough to adequately sample the rgb ( not at the rgb tip ) , but not so faint as to be adversely affected by large photometric errors and photometric incompleteness .",
    "this procedure yields a mean metallicity for the system of [ m / h ] @xmath92 , where the quoted error is that of the mean , not of the distribution",
    ". this error does not include possible systematic errors in the padova models , but does include a @xmath93  dex uncertainty due to distance .",
    "the errors in our color calibration ( @xmath94  mag ) and the reddening ( @xmath95mag ) contribute an additional @xmath96  dex uncertainty to our determination .    to estimate an upper limit to the metallicity spread in the galaxy , we compared the observed width of the rgb to the expected dispersion derived from our artificial star experiments .",
    "to do this , we used the data displayed in the right - hand panel of figure  [ cmd ] , while excluding the one , extremely red ( f606w@xmath36f814w = 2.06 , f814w = 27.5 ) object from consideration .",
    "we then formed the sum @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the observed f606w@xmath36f814w color of each star with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , the predicted color for the star ( given its observed f814w magnitude and a system metallicity of [ m / h ] @xmath101 ) , and @xmath102 the expected color dispersion at magnitude f814w , derived from our artificial star experiments .",
    "the resulting value , @xmath103 for 95 degrees of freedom , indicates that the true red giant branch is slightly wider , but not inconsistent with , the distribution expected from a single metallicity population .",
    "this same type of analysis also demonstrates that any additional ( intrinsic ) color dispersion on the red giant branch must be less than @xmath104 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this limits the metallicity spread of our dsph galaxy to @xmath105  dex .",
    "the presence of stars brighter than the rgb tip have often been used to ascertain the existence of intermediate - age ( @xmath106  gyr ) stars : the more luminous the tip of the agb , the younger the stellar population @xcite .",
    "our cmd shows that our dwarf spheroidal galaxy contains very few stars brighter than f814w @xmath48 .",
    "however , since the number of stars present in the galaxy is small , it is difficult to make precise measurements of the agb phase of evolution .",
    "moreover , as @xcite have demonstrated , our dwarf galaxy resides within a sea of intracluster stars , so any rgb stars foreground to the dwarf can masquerade as ` brighter ' agb objects .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to place a limit on the presence ( or absence ) of agb stars in our galaxy . to do this",
    ", we used our derived distance to the dsph and the stars observed colors to estimate the bolometric magnitudes of the galaxy s brightest objects . specifically , we converted the stars f814w@xmath36f606w colors to @xmath107 using the color terms of @xcite , and applied the @xcite bolometric correction @xmath108 to generate values of @xmath109 for all objects fainter than f814w @xmath110 .",
    "this procedure is uncertain at the @xmath45  mag level : in addition to @xmath111  mag errors associated with the color transforms and bolometric correction , our distance to the galaxy is uncertain by @xmath112  mag . nevertheless , this calculation is sufficiently accurate for our purpose .",
    "a histogram of the derived values of @xmath109 for the brightest stars in the right - hand panel of figure  [ cmd ] is shown in figure  [ agb ] .",
    "also plotted are the maximum attainable luminosities for agb stars produced by 3 , 5 , 8 , and 10  gyr old populations @xcite .",
    "as the figure illustrates , our sample of stars contains two objects that may indicate the existence of a ( small ) number of intermediate age objects .",
    "both are sufficiently luminous ( @xmath113 and @xmath114  mag brighter than the rgb tip ) to exclude the possibility of image blending .",
    "however , both are also located on the very outskirts of the the galaxy , where the likelihood of contamination is greatest .",
    "since the density of intracluster stars ( immediately surrounding the dwarf ) with @xmath115 is 36  arcmin@xmath9 , we should expect our sample to contain @xmath116  contaminating source in this magnitude range .",
    "thus , it is uncertain whether these two bright objects are actual members of the galaxy .",
    "two of the three remaining stars with @xmath117 are projected near the center of the galaxy , and are thus likely to be associated with the dsph .",
    "if we apply the age-@xmath109 relation of @xcite to these objects , then the inferred age of the stellar population is more than 8 - 10  gyr .",
    "this is similar to the ages of the old populations seen in local group dsphs @xcite .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that these objects may be blends due to the more crowded environment ; if this is indeed the case , this would strengthen the conclusion that the galaxy contains no stars with ages less than @xmath118  gyr .      in order to determine the basic structural parameters for our dsph",
    ", we performed surface photometry on smoothed images of our frames . to do this",
    ", we began by increasing the per - pixel signal - to - noise of the f606w and f814w images by re - binning the data @xmath119 .",
    "we then smoothed each frame with a circular gaussian filter to produce images with a @xmath120 point - spread - function , and fit ellipses to the dsph s contours using the ellipse task in iraf / stsdas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* based on the algorithms of @xcite ) . to facilitate these fits , the center of the galaxy",
    "was kept fixed for each contour , but the position angle and ellipticity were allowed to vary to produce the best results .",
    "in addition , to aid in the measurement of this low surface brightness object , models were also computed for three nearby background galaxies , whose light contaminates the dsph s outer contours . by subtracting these models from the original image",
    ", we were able to improve the fits for the target galaxy .",
    "finally , to compute the surface brightness of each fitted contour , a sky background was determined using the median pixel value derived within ` empty ' regions of our frame .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profiles ( out to a radius of @xmath121 along the major axis ) are plotted in figure  [ profile ] as a function of the geometric mean radius ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "figure  [ profile ] confirms that our galaxy is indeed a dwarf spheroidal .",
    "the central surface brightness of the galaxy is typical of local group dwarf spheroidals @xcite , with @xmath123 in f606w and @xmath124 in f814w .",
    "moreover , as the dotted line in the figure demonstrates , the profile of the galaxy is well fit by a @xcite model . to derive this line",
    ", we convolved a series of @xcite profiles with the smoothed psf , and fit the f814w data using all measurements with errors less than 0.3  mag .",
    "this procedure yields an excellent fit @xmath125 , with a core radius of @xmath126 and a tidal radius of @xmath127 where the uncertainties are derived via monte carlo simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "at the distance of the dwarf , these measurements correspond to @xmath128  pc and @xmath129  pc , where the errors include the uncertainties in both the fit and the distance .",
    "we have also fit our surface brightness profiles with the commonly used @xcite profile ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,  @xmath130 .",
    "least squares fits to the f814w and f606w data yield shape parameters very close to the @xmath131 value expected for isothermal distributions : for the f814w image , @xmath132  mag  arcsec@xmath9 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , while the f606w profile has @xmath135  mag  arcsec@xmath9 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "both fits ( also plotted in figure  [ profile ] ) are only slightly worse than those for the king model ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 for the f814w and f606w fits , respectively ) , but are still a very good match to the data .",
    "we can also use the data of figure  [ profile ] to compute the integrated magnitude of our galaxy .",
    "if we sum the flux contained within each elliptical isophote , then the total magnitude of the dwarf spheroidal is f606w@xmath140 and f814w@xmath141 .",
    "these values are consistent with the f606w @xmath142 and f814w @xmath143 magnitudes obtained from simple photometry using an @xmath144 circular aperture centered on the galaxy .",
    "to convert these magnitudes to @xmath22 and @xmath21 , we used the color transformations of @xcite , and to obtain absolute magnitudes , we applied the distance and reddening values given in section 3.1 ; no additional corrections to our integrated magnitudes were required as our profiles extend to very faint surface brightnesses .",
    "the data imply that the dsph galaxy has a total absolute magnitude of @xmath145 ( and @xmath146 ) , where the error again includes both the uncertainties of the photometry and the distance .",
    "detailed observations in the local group demonstrate that dsph galaxies possess a variety of star - formation histories and chemical abundances @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the effect of environment on their formation and evolution .",
    "if so , then the properties of such galaxies in dense clusters might be distinctly different from those of dsphs seen locally .",
    "unfortunately , although a few dwarf galaxies have been studied in other nearby groups , such as the m81 system @xcite , very little is known about dsphs in rich clusters .",
    "figure  [ comparison ] compares the observed central surface brightness , core radius , and metallicity of our virgo dsph with the corresponding properties of dsph galaxies in the local and m81 groups .",
    "the most striking aspect of the figure is how normal our dsph appears .",
    "the galaxy s structural parameters are similar to those of the leo  ii and ursa minor dwarfs ,  typical of objects present in the local neighborhood .",
    "this result is consistent with the studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who also found no significant structural differences between the dwarfs of the local group and those of virgo and fornax . for comparison ,",
    "the virgo results from @xcite are also plotted in figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion from the metallicity measurement of our dsph galaxy .",
    "dwarf elliptical and spheroidal galaxies in the local group obey a well - established luminosity - metallicity relation @xcite , where the more luminous galaxies are ( on average ) more metal - rich .",
    "this result , which is usually attributed to increased mass loss in systems with small potential wells @xcite , predicts the metallicity of our dsph galaxy fairly accurately .",
    "however , galaxies in clusters are expected to lose much of their mass to intracluster space via tidal encounters with other galaxies and with the cluster as a whole @xcite .",
    "if our dsph had been exposed to these forces for any length of time , we would expect its metallicity to be more in line with that of a higher - luminosity object .",
    "this does not appear the case : if anything , our galaxy s metallicity lies _ below _ the mean luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "this suggests that most of the galaxy s original stars are still bound to the system , or perhaps the luminosity - metallicity relation differs in the cluster environment .",
    "the structure of the galaxy appears to support this conclusion .",
    "tidal features are often detected in dsph galaxies via photometric deviations from a @xcite profile @xcite .",
    "as figure  [ profile ] demonstrates , our virgo dwarf is well - fit by a king model all the way down to @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , where the galaxy s surface brightness merges into that of the intracluster background @xcite .",
    "moreover , a plot of ( @xmath149 ) positions using only those stars with colors and magnitudes similar to those of the galaxy s rgb objects (  @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , reveals no obvious evidence for tidal distortion ( figure  [ xyplot ] ) .",
    "we note that our observations are not deep enough to see any low - level tidal disruption of this dsph galaxy : the large streams seen in the coma and centaurus clusters are only visible at surface brightnesses below @xmath152 @xcite , and the tails associated with the local group galaxies carina and ursa minor are at @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "thus we can not unambiguously state whether the dsph galaxy has undergone any tidal stripping . nevertheless , the metallicity arguments above suggest that the observed dsph is not the low - luminosity remains of a much more massive system (  as expected in galaxy harassment scenarios ) .    tidal threshing is not the only process that could affect dwarf galaxies in the cluster environment . in the local group ,",
    "ram pressure stripping may be a prime factor in the evolution of dsph galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , the n - body simulations of @xcite suggest that both tides and ram pressure are needed to explain the properties of local group objects .",
    "if true , then the effects of intracluster gas should be magnified in the denser regions of the virgo cluster core .",
    "if low - luminosity dwarfs can barely hold onto their gas ( and enrich themselves ) in the local group , then virgo dsphs should easily be stripped by the virgo intracluster medium .",
    "the result would be a dsph galaxy much like those observed in the local group ( as suggested by the structural similarities ) , but with less chemical enrichment , and a very narrow red giant branch .",
    "our dsph does show some evidence for enhanced pressure stripping : as figure  [ comparison ] shows , the galaxy s mean metallicity is slightly less than that predicted from dsph observations in the local and m81 groups . however , our rgb photometry is not precise enough to test for self - enrichment .",
    "local group dwarfs typically have metallicity dispersions of @xmath154  dex @xcite .",
    "our data , though consistent with a zero abundance spread , is best fit with an rgb color dispersion of @xmath155 ( @xmath114  dex ) and still admits a metallicity spread as great as @xmath156 ( @xmath157  dex ) .",
    "thus , while the data are suggestive , we can not say for certain that the virgo environment has had any additional effect on the dsph s chemical properties .",
    "deeper photometric studies of other virgo dsph galaxies would be very useful in ascertaining any differences between the chemical evolution of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies in clusters and those in the group environment .",
    "from the analyses in the previous section , it is clear that the dsph galaxy in our field lies in the virgo cluster and appears relatively undisturbed by its surroundings .",
    "its stellar population is very metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath158 ) and old , with no indication of stars younger than @xmath118 gyr . in this sense",
    "it is similar to the purely old local group dsph galaxies of ursa minor and draco .",
    "it is also similar to the dwarf galaxies recently observed by @xcite in the virgo cluster core  their central surface brightnesses and metallicities are also included in figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "they , too , obey the luminosity - metallicity relation for small galaxies and appear undisturbed by the cluster environment .",
    "the appearance of such ` pristine ' old , low - luminosity dwarf galaxies within the virgo cluster begs a question  how do these objects last so long in the cluster ?",
    "small galaxies should be easy prey for the tidal forces associated with the cluster environment @xcite , and , indeed , the velocity distribution of virgo de galaxies supports the idea that at least some fraction of the cluster s dwarfs are the stripped remains of larger , late - type systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is plausible that many of virgo s metal - poor intracluster stars @xcite originated in such galaxies",
    ". nevertheless , it seems clear that some dwarfs remain intact ; perhaps these are dwarfs that have recently fallen into the cluster , or have rather high m / l ratios",
    ".    a weak constraint on the history of our dsph galaxy can be obtained from its observed tidal radius . from @xcite ,",
    "the limiting radius of the galaxy should be @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the mass of the galaxy , @xmath161 , the mass of the cluster , @xmath162 , the galaxy s pericluster radius , and @xmath163 , the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "the mass of the galaxy can be obtained by analogy with local group objects : according to @xcite , dwarf galaxies with @xmath13 have mass - to - light ratios of @xmath164 , implying @xmath165 .",
    "the virgo cluster mass is similarly obtainable from the x - ray observations of @xcite : their data give a core radius of 56  kpc , a mass per unit length of @xmath166  kpc@xmath24 , and a total mass within 180  kpc ( the projected cluster distance of the galaxy ) of @xmath167 .",
    "a value of @xmath168 then excludes any orbit which extends into the inner @xmath169  kpc of the cluster .",
    "of course , there are any number of ways to satisfy this condition . for instance",
    ", the dsph may just now be falling into virgo for the first time .",
    "cepheids , the planetary nebula luminosity function , the surface brightness fluctuation method , and the tip of the red giant branch , all place the core of virgo at a distance of between 14.5 and 17  mpc @xcite .",
    "our dsph distance estimate of @xmath170  mpc is consistent with this range of values , but it also admits the possibility that the galaxy is slightly behind the main body of the cluster .",
    "if so , then the dsph s location may associate it with the infalling m86 system , which is @xmath171  mpc beyond m87 @xcite .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then our dwarf galaxy formed long ago in a smaller cluster / group , and the shredding of the galaxy is only now about to begin .    if the dwarf _ did _ originate and live much of its life in the cluster environment",
    ", then it would have to have a high mass to withstand the tidal forces of virgo s densest regions .",
    "this would require a mass - to - light ratio that is much larger than the ` normal ' value of @xmath164 observed in the local group .",
    "cdm models do suggest that dwarf galaxies can form out of dark matter halos much more massive than dynamical measurements suggest (  @xmath172 @xcite , and such objects would be able to resist tidal disruption .",
    "however , galaxies with large dark matter halos would not easily be stripped of their ism by ram pressure or galactic winds .",
    "@xcite point out that while low mass ( @xmath173 ) objects will rapidly lose their gas to the intracluster medium , more massive systems are likely to hold on to at least some of their interstellar medium . as a result , their stellar populations should be younger and more metal - rich than their lower - mass counterparts . while it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate the precise masses and conditions under which early gas removal is expected , the old",
    ", metal - poor population of our dwarf spheroidal argues against the presence of a very massive dark halo .",
    "the existence of such a massive halo could , however , be tested via high - resolution spectroscopic observations with the next generation of large telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , our lack of knowledge about the dwarf s current location and orbital characteristics precludes our placing a strong constraint on its origin . while we have no data on the presence ( or absence ) of h  i gas in the galaxy , that gas has certainly not created many new stars in the past @xmath174  gyr .",
    "thus , if gas were detected , it would not affect our basic conclusions .",
    "we report the discovery of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( with @xmath175 ) on deep _ acs _ f606w and f814w images of an intracluster field in the virgo cluster .",
    "the distance to the galaxy is @xmath176 mpc based on the location of its trgb ; this value is consistent with a location close to the core of the virgo cluster , although we can not rule out the possibility that this object is part of the m86 subcluster falling into virgo from behind .",
    "the galaxy is clearly resolved into stars , and our observations extend more than a magnitude down its red giant branch .",
    "we find that the galaxy is composed entirely of old ( @xmath177  gyr ) , and is very metal - poor , with [ m / h]@xmath178 .",
    "this metallicity is consistent with that expected for a galaxy of its luminosity ; if anything , the galaxy lies slightly below the mean luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "thus , the object is not the remains of a larger galaxy that has been tidally stripped or harassed .",
    "moreover , the dsph s structural properties are similar to those derived for dwarf galaxies in the local and m81 groups , suggesting that many of the same physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of local dsphs also apply to this virgo cluster object . based on this similarity , we suggest that our dsph galaxy is likely on its initial infall into the center of the cluster .",
