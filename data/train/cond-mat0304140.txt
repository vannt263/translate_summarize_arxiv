    "<S> the curvature stress of dna packed inside a phage is balanced against its electrostatic self - interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the dna density is supposed nonuniform and as a result the donnan effect is also inhomogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> the coarse - grained dna density is a nonlinear function of the dna radius of curvature at a given position inside the bacteriophage . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that a region ( or regions ) exists totally free from dna . </S>",
    "<S> the size of such holes is computed .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 address for correspondence : + t. odijk , p.o . </S>",
    "<S> box 11036 , 2301 ea leiden , the netherlands + e - mail : odijktcf@wanadoo.nl    the packing of dna in cells and viruses are problems in the nanothermodynamics @xcite of polyelectrolytes i.e. the systems are small and hence the free energies need not be extensive . a case in point is the compaction of dna inside bacteriophages where the extensive self - energy of the dna spool is balanced against the non - extensive energy of curvature arising mainly from a region of tightly wound dna surrounding a hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of non- extensivity depends on the problem at hand . </S>",
    "<S> for fairly large dna globules that are compacted in solution , the shape is determined by non - extensive terms whereas the volume is not @xcite .    in previous work @xcite we assumed the dna density in a coarse - grained continuum approximation to be homogeneous , but we relax this supposition here . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces a peculiar effect : the donnan effect is now also nonuniform and it happens to compete with the curvature stress which increases sharply in tightly wound regions . </S>",
    "<S> although the uniform approximation of @xcite agrees well with the dna spacings within bacteriophage t7 determined experimentally @xcite , the forces encountered in single molecule experiments @xcite of dna being forced into phi 29 phage by the connector motor seem to overestimate the predicted forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a reinvestigation of at least one assumption is warranted .    </S>",
    "<S> close - packed dna in vitro has often been found to be a hexagonal liquid crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes , for long polydisperse dna , the hexagonal phase appears to be precluded in favor of a possible  hexatic  phase @xcite but a full investigation of the algebraic decay of the ovientational order has yet to be carried out . here , </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of definiteness , we assume the dna lattice inside a phage is hexagonal ( for general , biologically oriented reviews on dna packaging in bacteriophages , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a lattice is probably rarely ever ideal but is bound to contain dna crossovers leading to knotted entanglements upon release of the dna from the phage @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> theories of slightly deformed hexagonal phases have been set up previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they apply to macroscopic or extensive systems . here , our compacted dna is of mesoscopic dimensions and its properties are dominated by nonextensive curvature stresses so we simply disregard fluctuations in the director @xmath1 and coarse - grained dna density @xmath2 at position @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear double - stranded dna has only two ends so to a good approximation a well - known continuity law applies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 we next assume absence of splay ( @xmath5 ) since the splay elastic constant is expected to be very large . in general , at constant density , we would deal with the theory of so - called developable domains in describing the deformed hexagonal liquid crystal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here consider deformations of nonuniform densities in such a way that the director remains perpendicular to the density gradient . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq1 ] ) is obeyed .    </S>",
    "<S> now the simplest total free energy of the dna coil as a functional of the density @xmath2 seems to be @xmath6 + u_{b}\\left [ \\rho ( \\mathbf{r } ) \\right ] \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the free energy of the dna interacting with itself in a hypothetically straightened hexagonal lattice ( though it is inhomogeneous across the plane perpendicular to its central axis ) and @xmath8 is the bending energy given by @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the dna persistence length , @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath12 is the temperature and @xmath13  is the radius of curvature of the dna wormlike coil at position @xmath14  on the dna contour of total length @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> as already stated , undulations of the dna will be disregarded in the tightly packed state we focus on . if we define the surface area @xmath16  of the unit cell of the deformed hexagonal lattice at position @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we may introduce a continuum approximation @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the length of a dna nonomer is @xmath19 so that @xmath2  is a monomer density from now on . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 the number of monomers inside the phage of volume @xmath21  is kept fixed . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 supposing gradients of @xmath23 may be disregarded in @xmath7 , we now minimize the total free energy with respect to @xmath23while accounting for the constraint eq.([eq5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 we have introduced the inhomogeneous bulk chemical potential of the dna monomers ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is readily seen that the curvature term becomes appreciable for tightly wound regions appropriate for dna packed in phages .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we need an expression for the dna chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the phage is in thermodynamic equilibrium with a large reservoir containing a univalent salt of concentration @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> the phage is presumed to be free from multivalent ions . </S>",
    "<S> we first focus on a homogeneous hexagonal lattice of dna and its donnan equilibrium with such a reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> one convenient approximation for the osmotic pressure is due to oosawa @xcite . for our purposes </S>",
    "<S> , we set the osmotic coefficient equal to a constant so we write the osmotic pressure @xmath27  of the uniform bulk hexagonal phase with respect to the buffer as @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 the uniform monomer density of the lattice is @xmath31 and the bjerrum length @xmath32  in terms of the elementary charge @xmath33 and the permittivity of the solvent @xmath34 . for a uniform hexagonal lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the area of the unit cell is @xmath35 where @xmath36  is the lattice spacing i.e. the distance between centeraxes of adjacent dna helices ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq7 ] ) is , of course , an approximation though , on the whole , it does agree with recent careful measurements of the osmotic pressure of dna suspensions by raspaud et al @xcite ( to a good approximation , the pressure conforms to a universal form @xmath38 independent of any model ; the osmotic coefficient is also quite constant ) . at very high concentrations , </S>",
    "<S> the oosawa approximation does seem to underestimate experimental pressures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been attributed to a failure of the oosawa model at close separations @xcite but a calculation not invoking cylindrical symmetry still needs to be presented . under conditions of tight packing , it is reasonable to neglect undulatory entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk free energy is now the work of compressing the lattice from a state of infinite separation to the state at hand all the while keeping the chemical potential of the reservoir electrolyte fixed . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 = lf_{int}+const.n=-3^{\\frac{1}{2}}l\\int_{\\infty } ^{h}dh^{\\prime } h^{\\prime } \\pi _ { os}(h^{\\prime } ) + const . </S>",
    "<S> n \\label{eq9}\\ ] ] @xmath40   \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the chemical potential @xmath41 /\\partial n$ ] of a dna monomer at a fixed volume and buffer concentration may be expressed by @xmath42   \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] note that the limiting forms of the logarithmic term are @xmath43  as @xmath44  and @xmath45  as @xmath46 ; still , in practice , the variable @xmath47 is often of order unity .    </S>",
    "<S> we next apply eq.([eq12 ] ) to the deformed dna lattice inside the phage whose density @xmath48  at equilibrium is given by eq.([eq6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 where @xmath50  is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> this is rewritten as @xmath51 implying that the dimensionless function @xmath52 must be larger than unity otherwise a solution to eq.([eq13 ] ) does not exist . without knowing the precise structure of the dna globule inside the phage , we already conclude from eq.([eq13 ] ) that tightly wound regions of curvature radius @xmath53 nm must be depleted of dna ( persistence length @xmath10 = 50 nm ; bjerrum length @xmath54 = 0.71 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tight bending of the dna causes an increase in the curvature stress which has to be relieved by lowering the electrostatic stress ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the profile about a cylindrical hole within a phage filled with dna of genomic size . </S>",
    "<S> then , the dna almost fills the compartment of volume @xmath21  completely so we have from eq.([eq5 ] ) @xmath55 i.e. @xmath56 by way of example , let us reconsider the data on phage t7 of cerritelli at al @xcite which we previously analyzed in terms of a model of uniform density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nacl concentration of the buffer was 0.1 m. the dna genome of length @xmath15  is enclosed in a volume @xmath21 of about 77600 nm@xmath57 which almost equals the volume @xmath58  of the dna lattice itself . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq16 ] ) then yields @xmath59 and @xmath60 . accordingly , </S>",
    "<S> the radius @xmath61 of the ( presumably single ) hole free from dna is computed from eq.([eq13 ] ) : @xmath62 yielding @xmath63 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with a hole radius of about 4 nm or possibly larger , based on the experimental spacing ( @xmath64 nm ) and estimates of the inner volume of bacteriophage t7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative route to a theoretical estimate for @xmath61 is via the ( average ) experimental spacing @xmath65 : the volume @xmath58  of the dna lattice is slightly less than @xmath21  and so @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have @xmath67 from eq.([eq16 ] ) and again @xmath63 nm . similar conclusions apply to recent structural work on bacteriophage t4 @xcite . if the phage is modeled as an ideal sphere of radius @xmath68 nm , the radius of the hole would be about 10 nm ( setting @xmath69 nm ; @xmath70 m ) from eq.([eq17 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> olson et al @xcite studied the dna density which decreases inward starting from the outer capsid shell and there does appear to be a hole of radius @xmath71 nm . </S>",
    "<S> however , at present , it is difficult to make this comparison more quantitative . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can justify the neglect of density gradients and coulomb integral terms in eq.([eq2 ] ) ; they are only of relative magnitude @xmath72 which is much smaller than unity .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from a simple model of close - packed dna enclosed in phages , in which we relax the supposition of uniformity , that a hole ( or holes ) must occur free from dna , at least at ionic strengths typical of laboratory or physiological conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature stress in a tightly wound region of dna becomes so high that the nonuniform donnan effect can only compete up to a point ; the dna is thus forced out of such a region beyond a certain curvature given by eq.([eq17 ] ) ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . it would be interesting to see if the dna density may be approximated by eq.([eq13 ] )  which is independent of the shape of the capsid ( ! )  but one has to be wary about the limitations of the present continuum analysis . at low densities , toward a hole , the dna mesophase should become more disordered . </S>",
    "<S> kasspidou and van der maarel have established that a hexagonal phase of short dna rods melts into a cholesteric phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this happens , for instance , at an interaxial spacing of @xmath73 nm in a 0.10 m nacl solution . </S>",
    "<S> it is then predicted from eq.([eq14 ] ) that such a transition would occur at a radius of curvature @xmath74 nm in the t7 phage @xcite , at least if we are allowed to extrapolate the results for short rods @xcite to long dna . at such nanoscales the concept of phases </S>",
    "<S> becomes very tentative of course . </S>",
    "<S> anyway , the more disordered cholesteric  phase  surrounding the hole would still have an average spacing @xmath75 very similar to that of the coexisting hexagonal phase @xcite in the bulk of the phage . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility for disorder is an escape of a section of the dna  into the third dimension  </S>",
    "<S> i.e. if a dna strand aligns along the cylindrical axis of the hole . </S>",
    "<S> such a state would seem to be unstable however .    </S>",
    "<S> the buffers used in @xcite also contain magnesium ions though not in excess . </S>",
    "<S> when genomic dna is then packaged in bacteriophage t7 , two raman bands of the dna are significantly perturbed with respect to dna in solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> overman et al attribute this to enhanced magnesium concentrations within the phage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of divalent ions has not been allowed for here although we note that magnesium is absent in the buffers used by cerritelli et al @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> small angle x - ray scattering could be useful in trying to verify the profile predicted by eq.([eq14 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that the scattering by phages is subtle with regard to interpretation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wavevector dependence of the scattering by lyotropic liquid crystals is peculiar in its dependence on the osmotic compressibility and the elastic moduli @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it might be useful to extend theories pertaining to scattering from the bulk @xcite to that from the dna mesophase confined in phages . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that there is a length scale in the theory for a fluctuating splayless liquid crystal which turns out to be identical to our decay length @xmath76 in eq.([eq13 ] ) ( in @xcite , there is also a competition of bending and osmotic stresses ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dna liquid crystal near the outer rim of the phage behaves much like a useful polymer liquid crystal but this is no longer true near the hole . </S>"
