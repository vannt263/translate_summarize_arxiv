    "3c48  ( @xmath3 ) is a remarkable quasar quite aside from the fact that it was the first to be identified @xcite . as seems to be the case with a number of `` prototypes , '' it is far from typical .",
    "the original identification of 3c48  depended in part on the small size of its radio source , and 3c48  and 3c277.1 remain the only examples of compact steep - spectrum ( css ) radio sources among powerful quasars at redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "the host galaxy of 3c48  is unusually large and bright in comparison with those of other low - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "it is now recognized that these host galaxy properties are largely a result of a major merger @xcite .",
    "3c48  was the first quasar for which an extended distribution of ionized gas was observed @xcite , and it still is one of the most luminous examples of extended emission among low - redshift qsos @xcite .",
    "it is one of a handful of previously identified qsos to have been shown by iras also to be ultraluminous ir galaxies .",
    "star formation is currently underway at a prodigious rate in the inner part of the host galaxy @xcite , and there are still massive reserves of molecular gas @xcite . all things taken together indicate that we are witnessing a brief but important phase in the history of a quasar , a time when host - galaxy star formation is near its peak , the radio jet is breaking through the dense material in the inner part of the host galaxy , and uv radiation from the central continuum source has just recently become visible along many lines of sight .",
    "@xcite noticed that the [ ] profile in 3c48  was significantly blueshifted relative to the broad h@xmath5 line .",
    "higher - resolution spectroscopy of the quasar @xcite shows the reason for this apparent shift : in addition to the usual nuclear narrow - line region , there is very luminous extended high - velocity gas within about 05 of the nucleus .",
    "@xcite presented evidence from their integral - field - unit spectroscopy that the high - velocity gas has been accelerated by the interaction of the radio jet with the surrounding medium .",
    "they discussed the variation of relative line ratios , velocities , and line widths of the high - velocity and systemic - velocity components .",
    "@xcite found that the high - velocity gas was resolved on a slit through the nucleus at position angle @xmath6 , with an extent of @xmath7 and a discernible velocity gradient . but neither of these studies had sufficient spatial resolution to explore the detailed relation between the radio jet and the high velocity gas .",
    "@xcite long ago showed the presence of strong balmer absorption in the 3c48host galaxy .",
    "@xcite examined the host galaxy of 3c48  in more detail with the keck low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) and showed that the spectrum of the stellar population had a classic `` k+a '' character .",
    "the fact that they saw balmer absorption lines from a relatively young stellar population as well as evidence for an older population ( e.g. ,  from the mgi@xmath8 feature at @xmath9  ) meant that they could do a decomposition of the two components ( using stellar synthesis models , such as those of @xcite ) and estimate , at least in a relative sense , the time that had elapsed since the end of the major starburst phase . with sufficient signal - to - noise",
    ", it is possible to carry out such a decomposition at each point in the host galaxy , building up a map of starburst ages along lines of sight through the host galaxy ( strongly weighted towards the time at which the most recent major episode of star formation ceased ) .",
    "@xcite were able to determine starburst ages and stellar radial velocities in 32 distinct regions .",
    "but one of the most interesting features in the host galaxy was too close to the quasar to permit sufficiently low levels of contamination from quasar light to extract the galaxy spectrum .",
    "this is the luminosity peak 3c48a  @xmath0 northeast of the quasar , first noticed by @xcite and confirmed by subsequent groundbased and hst observations @xcite .",
    "one of our ground - based images is shown in fig .",
    "[ hstfield]@xmath10 , and _ hst _ pc images obtained from the archive are shown in fig .",
    "[ hstfield]@xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite originally suggested that 3c48a  was the secondary nucleus from a merging companion ; this suggestion was consistent with the presence of the tidal tail to the northwest , as well as evidence that we are seeing the 3c48  host galaxy near the stage of final merger @xcite .",
    "the attempt to model the merger by @xcite shows that there is short period during which the two nuclei would have a separation and position angle roughly similar to that observed for 3c48  and 3c48a . on the other hand ,",
    "the morphology of the css radio jet @xcite and the presence of the high velocity emission - line components near the quasar @xcite both suggest that there is a strong interaction between the radio jet and the ambient gas in the general region of 3c48a .",
    "3c48a  is dominated by continuum radiation ; i.e. ,  the offset peak is seen on continuum images but not on narrow - band [ oiii ] images @xcite .",
    "however , there is no detailed correspondence between the morphology of the jet and that of 3c48a  ( the jet proceeds nearly northwards rather than northeasterly ) , so the optical emission from 3c48a   can not be due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "it clearly is unlikely to be nebular thermal continuum from an interaction of the jet and the gas , because we would expect fairly strong emission - line radiation at reasonable temperatures .",
    "@xcite find colors for 3c48a  consistent with stars with ages similar to the likely age of the radio jet ( @xmath12 years ) .",
    "the hst images show that 3c48a  is curiously distorted ; this distortion could result either from the shape of an overpressured region resulting from shocks from the radio jet or from the tidal stretching of the nucleus of a merging companion .",
    "here we use gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) integral - field - unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy to analyze more precisely the position and extent of the high - velocity emission , and spectroscopy with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) to attempt to determine the nature of 3c48a .",
    "our principal goals for the stis observations are ( 1 ) to determine whether the continuum radiation associated with 3c48a  is indeed due to stars ; if so , ( 2 ) to determine the ages of the stellar populations involved and whether there is an age discontinuity ; and ( 3 ) to measure velocities of the stellar component : do these show any evidence for distinct kinematical signature , such as might be expected if 3c48a  is the distorted nucleus of a merging companion .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath13 and @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 .",
    "we obtained two - dimensional spectroscopy of the central region of 3c48  with the integral - field mode of gmos on the gemini north telescope ( program i d no .",
    "gn-2003b - c-5 ) .",
    "we used the half - field mode with the b600 grating , which gave a field of @xmath16 and a wavelength range of 43187194  .",
    "the lenslets have a width of 02 , and the ccd pixels correspond to 005 .",
    "the total exposure was 9000 s , obtained as 5 1800 s exposures .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard star g191b2b provided the flux calibration .",
    "the raw spectral images were processed with the standard gemini iraf routines to give the flux calibrated data cube .",
    "the 6256 spatial planes of the data cube have dimensions of @xmath17 pixels ( 005 square ) and are spaced at intervals of 0.46  .",
    "this data cube still suffers from the effects of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "since the quasar was included within the field of view , we were able to determine its centroid for each spatial plane of the data cube .",
    "we fitted a low - order cubic spline curve to the plot of each of the coordinates as a function of wavelength and used these to generate correction offsets for each plane of the data cube . applying these corrections generated a new data cube for which all of the image planes were correctly registered .",
    "the field of view for which the full range of wavelengths is available is , of course , somewhat smaller than the nominal field because of the atmospheric dispersion .",
    "this corrected data cube was used for analysis when we had to deal with a large wavelength range . however , for our detailed analysis of the [ ]  profile , we used the uncorrected data cube , as described in   [ hivel ] , in order to avoid unnecessary interpolation .",
    "the final image resolution at 6800   ( near redshifted [ ] ) was 055 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the stis spectroscopy was carried out with the g430l grating , covering a nominal region from 2900   to 5700  .",
    "the slit was centered at a position 097 east and 050 north of the quasar , at a position angle of 4474 .",
    "the efficiency decreases quite drastically towards the uv end of the spectrum , and the useful spectral range for our project was restricted to 3630   to 5685  . because of the low surface brightness of 3c48a , we used the 05 slit and binned by 2 pixels in the dispersion direction , obtaining a total of 21076  s of integration over 8 orbits .",
    "the spectra were dithered over 4 positions along the slit .",
    "the slit position , superposed on the _ hst _ pc f555w image , is shown in fig .",
    "[ hstfield]@xmath18 .",
    "we also obtained 626  s of integration on the quasar itself with the same configuration , but without binning .",
    "each of the 8 individual spectra of 3c48a  was first given a preliminary cleaning of cosmic rays with lacos_im @xcite .",
    "a few additional cosmic rays and other blemishes were masked manually .",
    "masks from both the automatic and manual cosmic - ray detection for each frame were combined with dead- and hot - pixel masks generated from all of the frames .",
    "the dithered spectra and the corresponding frame masks were then shifted to a common position and coadded , using the iraf task _ imcombine _ with _ ccdclip _ rejection ( in addition to rejection of masked pixels ) .",
    "the background , including an estimate of the stellar background in the 3c48  host galaxy , was removed by subtracting a linear fit to regions on either side of 3c48a .",
    "the background level amounted to roughly a third of the total extracted flux in our spectral aperture , and we estimate that its scaling is accurate to @xmath19% .",
    "the spectrum of the brightest part of 3c48a  was extracted , using a region 6 pixels ( 03 ) wide .",
    "some of the remaining noise spikes were removed by fitting a 160-piece cubic spline to the spectrum and rejecting points more than @xmath20 away from the fit .",
    "the redshift was roughly determined from the [ ] @xmath21 doublet , and the spectrum was reduced to the approximate rest frame .",
    "this redshift was corrected to a final value from fits to the stellar absorption - line spectrum .",
    "a full analysis of the emission over the field will be presented elsewhere ; here , we concentrate only on emission very close to the quasar .",
    "for extracting spectra from our atmospheric - dispersion - corrected gmos ifu data cube , we define 13 apertures : one centered on the quasar , and two sets equally spaced on circles around the quasar at position angles 0 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , and 300 .",
    "the inner circle has a radius of 04 , and the outer circle has a radius of 11 ; the inner apertures are labeled a0 , a60 , a120 ... , and the outer apertures are labeled b0 , b60 ... , where the numerical part of the designation indicates the position angle of the aperture center from the quasar .",
    "all of the apertures were gaussian weighted and were truncated at the fwhm of the gaussian profiles , which was set to 04 .",
    "we show the spectra of the quasar and the outer ( b ) ring of apertures in fig .",
    "[ ifufull ] .",
    "it was not possible to correct the off - nuclear spectra in fig .",
    "[ ifufull ] for scattered light from the nucleus because of the uncertain variation of the scattered contribution with wavelength .",
    "however , we can make this correction ( with typically about 20% accuracy ) for the region in the immediate vicinity of h@xmath5 by subtracting a version of the quasar spectrum scaled to eliminate the broad h@xmath5 line in the residual .",
    "we show the region of h@xmath5 and [ ]  @xmath22 , 5007 lines after this subtraction for our 6 off - nuclear b apertures ( centered 11 from the quasar ) in fig .",
    "[ ifuoiii ] ( left panel ) , as well as the same region for the quasar . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ifuoiii ] , we show similarly subtracted spectra for the a apertures ( centered 04 from the quasar ) .    for the apertures at 11 radius ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ ifuoiii ] , the high - velocity component shows up most strongly in the b0 and b60 apertures ; it is essentially completely absent in the b180 , b240 , and b300 apertures .",
    "there is a clear velocity offset of the high - velocity component between the b0 and b60 apertures , as well as evidence for more than two velocity components in the former .",
    "the high velocity emission is much stronger in the inner apertures , particularly the a0 aperture , where the flux has over 10 times the highest value that it has in any of the outer apertures .",
    "it is absent from the a120 , a180 , and a240 apertures , but present in the a60 and a300 apertures .",
    "for this inner ring of apertures , the aperture boundaries are adjacent to each other , so there will be unavoidable spill - over because of the 055 fwhm seeing disk .    at first sight , it may appear that is a problem with the subtraction procedure because of negative [ ]  residuals , particularly in the a180 spectrum .",
    "note , however , that these negative excursions are only at the wavelength of the high - velocity component .",
    "the explanation is almost certainly that the quasar aperture encompasses high - velocity emission slightly extended to the north , which is then excess to the scattered nuclear quasar contribution to apertures on the south side .    in order to explore the spatial distribution of the high - velocity material in more detail ,",
    "we analyze the image planes of the data cube as we step across the [ ]  line profile .",
    "since we are here concentrating on a very small range of wavelengths around the [ ]  @xmath23 emission complex , we can use the original data cube , uncorrected for atmospheric dispersion , thus avoiding any smearing from subpixel interpolation . the maximum shift due to dispersion",
    "was confirmed to be less than 0.1 pixel ( @xmath24 ) over this wavelength range .",
    "the general approach is this : we use the continuum on either side of the [ ] @xmath23 line to precisely define the psf of the quasar ; we bin narrow wavelength intervals to form images from the data cube as we step across the line profile , and we then subtract a scaled psf from each of these to show the distribution of extended emission close to the quasar for each part of the line profile . in more detail , we used narrow regions of continuum ( @xmath19   wide ) immediately on either side of the emission line to define the psf centroid at the line , but we used wider ( @xmath25  ) continuum regions somewhat farther away to obtain better s / n for the psf profile itself .",
    "this high s / n psf was then carefully registered ( at the sub - pixel level ) to the psf at the emission - line wavelength .",
    "we used 11 4.6- - wide slices to span the double line profile . for each of these images , we ran the two - component deconvolution task plucy @xcite .",
    "briefly , plucy allows separate treatment of point sources ( which can be removed ) and a variable background component , which is deconvolved via the richardson - lucy algorithm , subject to an adjustable entropy constraint .",
    "the result was that any unresolved nuclear emission ( i.e. ,  that having a distribution indistinguishable from that of the quasar continuum ) was removed , and only extended emission was retained in the residual images .",
    "these images are shown in fig .",
    "[ nucemis ] , along with the location in the line profile each represents .",
    "we also show the radio jet @xcite at the same scale .",
    "what is immediately clear is that the high - velocity emission is concentrated to the north of the quasar , precisely in the initial direction of the radio jet , and mostly within the region where the jet appears relatively unperturbed .",
    "there is some slight variation in the position and shape of the distribution of emission across the high - velocity line profile , and there is a tail of emission at high velocities to the east , but the main emission peak remains closely aligned with the radio jet . as the wavelength window shifts towards the systemic redshift , the centroid of the extended emission moves more to the west , and more low - surface - brightness extended emission at greater distances becomes visible , including a possible ring of emission at about 1  radius from the quasar .",
    "our decomposition of the profile indicates that the narrow - line emission component at the systemic velocity is dominated by the high - velocity component at all points in the composite profile .",
    "the contribution of the systemic component is greatest ( almost 50% ) near its peak , but it drops off sharply at higher ( as well as lower ) velocities , because of the much broader velocity width of the high - velocity emission .",
    "we also expect the classical narrow - line region to be more closely centered on the nucleus and to be mostly unresolved .",
    "reconstruction of the line profile from the deconvolved , psf - subtracted images tends to bear out this expectation , although some residual systemic narrow - line emission still remains , perhaps indicating that this region is slightly resolved ( see also the profile in the a0 aperture in fig .",
    "[ ifuoiii ] ) .",
    "however , the shift in the centroid of the emission must still largely be due to a gradient in the high - velocity component , rather than any extension of the classical narrow - line region .    from an aperture that includes essentially",
    "all of the high - velocity emission , our decomposition of the [ ] profile gives a value of @xmath26 km s@xmath15 for the velocity offset between the two systems in the rest frame of the quasar .",
    "the [ ] fluxes in the two components are @xmath27 and @xmath28 erg s@xmath15 @xmath29 , respectively , for the high - velocity and systemic velocity components ; i.e. ,  the high - velocity gas has @xmath30 times the [ ] luminosity of that of the classical narrow - line region .",
    "we have attempted to estimate contributions to the h@xmath5 profile from these two narrow - line components .",
    "we take the best - fitting gaussian decomposition of the [ ] profile , shift these to the appropriate positions and widths for h@xmath5 at the same redshifts , and scale the two components independently to obtain the maximum subtraction consistent with a smooth and fairly symmetric core for the h@xmath5 residual .",
    "this procedure gives a narrow - line h@xmath5/ [ ] ratio of @xmath31 for the systemic - velocity component and @xmath32 for the high - velocity component .",
    "we have also carried out decompositions of the [ ] @xmath21 doublet and the [ ] @xmath33 line .",
    "the [ ] case is complicated by the uncertainty in the density - dependent doublet line ratio for each of the components , but the formal best fit gives a line ratio at or near the low - density limit and a total flux @xmath34%  of that of [ ] @xmath23 for the high - velocity component and a line ratio near unity ( indicating an electron density of a few hundred per @xmath35 ) and a total flux @xmath36%of that of [ ] @xmath23 for the component at the systemic velocity .",
    "for the [ ] line , the high - velocity and systemic components have fluxes around 14%  and 20%  of those of their respective [ ] profiles .",
    "our ratios for the two velocity systems for h@xmath5/ [ ] and [ ] / [ ] are quite consistent with those reported by @xcite .",
    "all in all , the ionization parameters of the two components seem roughly similar .    from our estimate of the h@xmath5 flux in the high - velocity component , and assuming an electron density and temperature , the mass of the ionized gas in this component is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proton mass , @xmath39 is the luminosity distance , @xmath40 is the effective recombination coefficient for h@xmath5 , and @xmath41 is the energy of an h@xmath5 photon ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the recombination coefficient is roughly an inverse linear function of temperature over the relevant temperature range ; by assuming @xmath42 k , we are unlikely to be in error from this parameter by more than a factor of two .",
    "if we now assume that @xmath43 @xmath44 and use the h@xmath5 flux derived from the h@xmath5/ [ ] ratio found above , we obtain @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this is likely a fairly firm lower limit to the total mass .",
    "densities much higher than 100 @xmath44 would be inconsistent with our fit to the [ ] @xmath21 profile .",
    "it remains quite possible , however , that most of the mass of the gas could have a density @xmath47 @xmath44 , as it appears to be the case , for example , in the extended emission region around 4c37.43 @xcite . if this is true for the high - velocity gas associated with 3c48 its total mass could be as much as @xmath48 @xmath46 .",
    "masses in this range can pose interesting constraints on acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the high - velocity gas is centered at a projected distance @xmath49 kpc from the quasar with a differential radial velocity of @xmath50 km s@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite argue that the weakness of the central radio component in 3c48  means that the radio axis is likely closer to the plane of the sky than to the line of sight . in this case",
    ", the projected distance will be essentially the physical distance , and the radial velocity will be a lower limit to the space velocity .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find @xmath51 absorption at @xmath52 in the spectrum of 3c48 , which corresponds to a radial velocity difference in the quasar frame of 780 km s@xmath15 .",
    "thus , it would be reasonable to use @xmath53 km s@xmath15 as a lower limit to the propagation speed of the radio plasma through the ambient medium . a plausible lower limit to the kinetic energy of the high - velocity gas",
    "is then @xmath54 erg , where @xmath55 is the mass of the high - velocity gas in units of @xmath56 solar masses , and @xmath57 is the bulk average velocity of the gas , relative to the quasar , in units of 800 km s@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite estimate the total energy of the radio plasma as @xmath58 erg , so the kinetic energy of the gas may account for a significant fraction of the original energy of the jet . in this case , it is clear that the gas can exert a major influence on the development of the jet , as @xcite and @xcite infer from the morphology of the jet itself .",
    "nevertheless , it is significant that most of the high - velocity gas is closer to the quasar than the region where the radio jet appears to be disrupted .",
    "the final stis spectrum of the high - surface - brightness arc - like structure in 3c48ais shown in fig .",
    "[ stisspec ] . as had been indicated by a comparison of broad - band and [ ] _ hst _ wfpc imaging , the feature is dominated by continuum radiation , although some [ ] @xmath21 emission is present .",
    "a prominent h@xmath59 absorption line , seen at the long - wavelength end of the spectrum , together with a minimum in the continuum near the balmer limit , suggests that the continuum is largely due to moderately early - type stars .",
    "fits of spectral synthesis models confirm this conclusion .",
    "the absorption - line redshift , heavily dependent on h@xmath59 , is @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ stisspec ] ( _ left panel _ ) , we overplot on the spectrum @xcite solar - metallicity instantaneous - burst models with ages ranging from 100 to 200 myr , which appear to bracket the luminosity - weighted average age of the stars ( we also include a 10-myr model for reference ) .",
    "the best fit , judged by the slope of the continuum shortward of the balmer limit , is about 140 myr .",
    "we have explored the possibility of younger stellar ages , combined with internal reddening , as a means of trying to fit the observed spectrum .",
    "the fundamental difficulty with this approach is the rapid decrease in the amplitude of the balmer - limit break at ages below 100 myr , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ stisspec ] .",
    "because of the short wavelength interval involved ( from @xmath61   to @xmath62  ) , the break can not be significantly enhanced by reddening without doing unacceptable violence to the rest of the spectrum , and this conclusion holds for any plausible reddening law .",
    "it has previously been noted ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) that our particular line of sight to 3c48  must have little or no significant reddening , in spite of the evidence for a major starburst in the host galaxy , and this conclusion seems to hold for 3c48a  as well , in spite of suggestions to the contrary by @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is some evidence for a k line stronger than in our models give encouraged us to try combinations of an old stellar population with a younger one .",
    "such a composite population might be expected to allow a younger age for the young population .",
    "( recall , however , that the host galaxy background near 3c48a   has been subtracted off to first order by our reduction procedure , so that any significant older population would likely have to be from 3c48a  itself ) .",
    "the general results of these experiments are that it is difficult to add any substantial fraction ( by light ) of old stars without unacceptable decreases in both the h@xmath59 strength and the balmer break amplitude , and , even with a fairly large fraction of old stars ( 20% at rest - frame 4050  ) , the younger component still could not be much younger than 10@xmath63 years .    while the difficulties of attempting to obtain a clean spectrum of 3c48a  from ground - based observations are formidable because of scattered quasar light ( and particularly the difficulty of correcting for its wavelength variation ) as well as contamination from other parts of the host galaxy , we were encouraged by the fact that our 60  aperture , which covers 3c48a , shows a substantially higher continuum level than the other apertures , even in the uncorrected spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ ifufull ] .",
    "we tried simply subtracting a straight mean of the other 5 off - nuclear apertures , which are all at the same distance from the quasar .",
    "if the quasar profile is closely symmetric , this procedure should remove the scattered quasar light reasonably well .",
    "it will also , to first order , subtract the host - galaxy background , although there is certainly no guarantee that this will be very accurate , because of variations in the host galaxy surface brightness .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ ifua ] .",
    "naturally , one must be wary of putting too much trust in the details of this residual spectrum because of variations among the 5 spectra that have been subtracted from it .",
    "nevertheless , it does agree with the general features of the stis spectrum remarkably well , and it reinforces the conclusion that the dominant stellar population in 3c48amust be old enough to show a substantial balmer break .",
    "these results are difficult to reconcile with the suggestion that 3c48a  is in some way connected with the radio jet .",
    "the fact that 3c48a  is dominated by stellar radiation eliminates any possibility that it is due to any form of gaseous emission or emission connected with relativistic electrons , such as synchrotron radiation or compton upscattering of photons .",
    "dust scattering of starlight from elsewhere in the host galaxy is extremely unlikely , given that the most luminous source around by far is the quasar itself , and no hint of scattered quasar radiation is seen in the stis spectrum .",
    "a remaining possibility is jet - induced star formation , as has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "this now also seems unlikely because of the age of the stars .",
    "an approximate dynamical time scale for the jet can be estimated from its length and the velocity of the emission - line gas associated with it : @xmath64 yr . for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see   [ hivel ] ) , @xmath67 yr . the apparent stellar age of 3c48a  of @xmath68 years is thus much older than the likely age of the radio jet .",
    "it is also much older than the likely dynamical time indicated by the distance of 3c48a  from the jet if it had been produced by it .",
    "if the arc - like structure were to indicate that we are seeing the edge of a `` bubble '' of star formation caused by the jet , the vector from the point of origin of the bubble to the arc must likely be close to the plane of the sky . because there is every indication that the host galaxy of 3c48  is quite massive , yet the observed radial velocity range of the stars is quite small @xcite , stellar motions",
    "must be mostly in the plane of the sky .",
    "in this case , transverse velocities of at least 100 km s@xmath15 must be expected for stars in this feature at @xmath69 kpc from the quasar .",
    "this means that over @xmath70 years , we expect space motions of @xmath71 kpc , far larger than the @xmath72 kpc observed projected separation between the end of the radio jet and 3c48a .",
    "furthermore , @xcite had found a general trend of younger average stellar ages as one moves inward in the 3c48  host galaxy , with stellar ages in the inner region of @xmath73 years , consistent with a stellar population dominated by a current starburst .",
    "3c48a  therefore shows a clear age discontinuity with the stars in the host galaxy just slightly farther out from the center .",
    "there is suggestive , but not conclusive , evidence for a velocity discontinuity as well .",
    "the two host - galaxy regions with absorption - line velocities in the study by @xcite that are closest to 3c48a , c2 and b3 ( @xmath74 northeast and east , respectively ) , have stellar velocities @xmath75 and @xmath76 higher than that of 3c48a",
    ". velocity gradients for the stars in central region of the 3c48  host galaxy appear to be quite low , so this may be a significant difference .",
    "all of this makes the possibility that 3c48a  is actually the distorted nucleus of the merging galaxy @xcite seem much more attractive .",
    "an age of @xmath77 years is not unreasonable for the time of the previous close passage prior to final merging .",
    "it is also similar to the age of star - formation regions found in the leading edge of the tidal tail ( @xmath78 myr ; @xcite ) , which might plausibly date from the same phase of the encounter .",
    "the observations reported here are closely related to two previous spectroscopic studies of 3c48 and its host galaxy that have already been mentioned : those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have at various points noted comparisons of our present results with these earlier studies , but it is worth discussing areas of agreement and disagreement more systematically .",
    "@xcite obtained imaging spectroscopy of a @xmath79 field around 3c48 with an ifu consisting of 655 optical fibers , each with a diameter of 04 , mounted in the multi - object spectrograph of the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "the total exposure was 2700 s , and the seeing during the observation was reported to be @xmath80 .",
    "the basic conclusions of this study were that : ( 1 ) the broad , blueshifted [ ] emission noticed in previous observations was actually due to a combination of the normal narrow - line region at the systemic redshift and a high - velocity component blueshifted by @xmath81 km s@xmath15 ; ( 2 ) this high - velocity component dominates the [ ] profile in the center and over a region at least 06 to the north and east of the quasar ; ( 3 ) the location and energetics of this high - velocity gas are consistent with its having been accelerated by the radio jet ; ( 4 ) the continuum colors of 3c48a  indicate dominance by a stellar population younger than @xmath82 years , with the star formation likely triggered by the radio jet ; and ( 5 ) while much of the emission - line gas appears to be photoionized by the central source , there is some evidence for additional ionization from shocks .",
    "@xcite were mainly concerned with stellar population distributions and ages in the host galaxy , but also discussed the emission lines present in their spectra .",
    "they obtained classical long - slit spectra with the low - resolution imaging spectrograph on the keck ii telescope , with 6 different slit positions .",
    "they also resolved the nuclear high - velocity component , obtaining a velocity difference from the systemic narrow - line emission of @xmath83 km s@xmath15 .",
    "while the limitations of using slits meant that they could not effectively map its distribution , they were able to see that it had a strong velocity gradient over its extent of @xmath7 in a slit through the nucleus at position angle 333 .",
    "in agreement with @xcite , @xcite also felt that the general location and velocity of this gas was strong evidence for a scenario in which it has been driven by the radio jet .",
    "@xcite were not able to say anything about the stellar population of 3c48abecause scattered light from the nucleus completely dominated the spectrum in that region and could not be removed reliably , but they found quite young ages ( @xmath84 myr , consistent with ongoing star formation ) for regions in the host galaxy they could measure that were just beyond 3c48a .",
    "on the basis of the colors reported by @xcite and on the morphologies of the _ hst _ images of 3c48a , @xcite stated , `` while it is still possible that this [ i.e. ,  3c48a ] may be , in fact , the distorted nuclear regions of the companion galaxy in the final stages of merger , it now seems more likely that it , too , is related to the interaction of the radio jet with the dense surrounding medium , as suggested by @xcite . ''",
    "the results we have given here support and refine the general conclusions of both of these previous studies regarding the high - velocity gas . with the higher resolution and better s /",
    "n of our deep ifu observations , we have been able to map out the distribution of the extended high - velocity gas in the region within @xmath0 of the nucleus and at several points in its velocity profile .",
    "these maps , shown in fig .",
    "[ nucemis ] , show that this emission peaks @xmath1 almost due north of the quasar , near the base of the jet , and not , as might have been expected , near the point of its obvious deflection and decollimation , roughly 05 north of the quasar .",
    "our velocity difference between the high - velocity and systemic components of [ ] is @xmath26 km s@xmath15 , compared with the previously reported values of @xmath83 km s@xmath15 @xcite and @xmath85 km s@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these differences are at least partly due to different approaches to calculating differential radial velocities from redshifts .",
    "@xcite simply treated the redshifts of the two components each as cosmological redshifts [ for which @xmath86 to find the difference in velocity , and @xcite apparently did the same .",
    "but since the velocity difference is actually due bulk motion of material at essentially the same cosmological redshift as the quasar , it is more nearly correct to use the relativistic doppler formula @xmath87 to calculate the velocity difference .",
    "if we use this approach for the previous determinations , the @xcite value becomes @xmath88 km s@xmath15 , and the @xcite value becomes @xmath89 km s@xmath15 , both of which are now consistent with our new value .",
    "( we also note that it is not clear how @xcite obtained their standard error of @xmath90 km s@xmath15 , since their determination is dominated by their [ ] @xmath23 velocity difference , which has a standard error of @xmath91 km s@xmath15 .",
    "this small error may , in fact , have been a misprint , since , in their `` conclusions '' section , @xcite give the value as @xmath92 km s@xmath15 . )",
    "@xcite had previously carried out a calculation of the total kinetic energy of the high - velocity ionized gas and compared this value with the energy available from the radio jet , similar to our calculation in   [ hivel ] .",
    "the main difference in the calculations is that @xcite assumed a mass for the gas given by @xcite , which happens to agree well with the mass we obtain if the density in the emitting region is close to our approximate upper limit of @xmath43 @xmath44 ( this agreement is mostly fortuitous , since @xcite used different cosmological parameters and determined the density simply by modeling the [ ] to [ ] emission - line ratio for a single - density medium ) .",
    "our lower limit to the kinetic energy is about 20% of the value ( _ not _ intended to be a lower limit ) obtained by @xcite , so we are roughly consistent , in spite of slightly different assumptions made in the respective calculations . in both cases ,",
    "the minimum energy in the high - velocity gas comprises a significant fraction of the energy of the radio jet , indicating that , if the radio jet is responsible for the current kinetic energy of the gas , the gas is quite capable of affecting the dynamics of the jet .",
    "however , especially given the fact that most of the emission occurs in a region where the jet seems relatively unperturbed , if the mass ( and therefore the kinetic energy ) of the gas should turn out to be significantly larger than the lower limit , it could prove to be difficult to provide sufficient energy from the radio jet alone .",
    "if this were the case , one might be forced to appeal to some other form of coupling the energy output of the quasar to the gas , the evacuation of a channel by the radio jet merely providing a convenient path for the high - velocity gas to escape . however , at this stage , such speculations are premature .    on the question of the origin of 3c48a ,",
    "we feel that our new estimate of the age of the stellar population dominating the continuum light requires a re - evaluation of the previous conclusions . in our view , the balance of the evidence has swung back to the original suggestion of @xcite that we are seeing the distorted nucleus of the merging companion , although with the modification that most of the light is coming from stars that were likely formed from gas driven inwards during the first close pass of the interaction , some @xmath70 years earlier .",
    "although we believe that our _ hst _ stis spectrum clearly demonstrates the dominance of stars with ages @xmath68 years , without more detailed information we can only speculate on why @xcite found much younger ages from their estimate of colors for 3c48a .",
    "it seems possible that scattered light from the quasar may have had a more important influence than they had estimated .",
    "@xcite claimed that the scattered contribution to 3c48a  was @xmath19% at 5100   and @xmath93% at 6900  .",
    "we have made simple models of 3c48  and 3c48a  using their quoted seeing of @xmath80 .",
    "with very conservative assumptions ( e.g. ,  a gaussian rather than a moffat profile for the quasar ) , we find that the scattered contribution from the quasar would dominate that of 3c48a  by at least a factor of 2",
    ". a more realistic estimate would certainly be much larger .",
    "an additional possibility is that , with their rather large aperture , centered 13 from the quasar , a bit beyond the center of light of 3c48a , at 11 , and with ground - based seeing , the light @xcite measured may have been dominated by the very young stellar populations in this region of the host galaxy @xcite , rather than light specifically from 3c48a .",
    "experiments with the _ hst _ pc f555w image indicate that over half of the light in such an aperture ( apart from scattered qso light ) would have come from host galaxy background stars rather than 3c48a .",
    "high velocity gas associated with high - redshift radio sources has often been attributed to shocks from , or entrainment by , radio jets ( e.g. ,  @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . in most cases ,",
    "the argument for these mechanisms has been largely circumstantial : usually , there are essentially no other plausible sources for the observed velocities . while hardly surprising , it is nevertheless gratifying to find that our high - resolution imaging strongly confirms the positional relation between the high velocity gas and the steep - spectrum radio jet in 3c48  found by @xcite .",
    "our main contribution here has been to show more clearly the distribution of the gas as a function of velocity within the profile and to show that it appears to be closely associated with the base and inner part of the jet , rather than the region farther from the quasar , where high - resolution radio maps show the most obvious deflection and decollimation .    in their two - dimensional simulations of the propagation of jets through inhomogeneous media ,",
    "@xcite show that it is quite plausible that css jets , such as that of 3c48 , do not require a direct collision with a dense cloud to suffer decollimation and deflection , as has often been assumed .",
    "instead , the jet , in overpressuring the intercloud medium , creates shocks that propagate into and reflect off of the dense clouds .",
    "these reflected shocks can then redistribute some of the forward momentum of the jet itself into transverse components .",
    "@xcite specifically consider the case of the 3c48  jet .",
    "they conclude that their model of a jet progressing through a medium with a rather small filling factor of dense clouds qualitatively matches the appearance of the 3c48  jet ( modulo possible differences a fully three - dimensional model might have from their two - dimensional simulations ) .",
    "the jet is not completely disrupted ; it roughly retains its initial direction , but it is deflected through a small angle , and it becomes decollimated into a fan of material .    taking this general picture as a working hypothesis , how does the high - velocity optical emission in 3c48  fit in ?",
    "one possibility is that it is due to shock excitation of the gas in the dense clouds responsible for decollimating the radio jet .",
    "however , our conclusion that most of the high - velocity emission comes from a region quite close to the quasar , before the jet shows significant disruption , means that the acceleration of the ionized gas is likely not closely coupled with the deflection of the jet .",
    "in addition , it is not clear that the dense clouds themselves will be accelerated to high velocities  whether they are or not depends on their size and mass distribution and the momentum transfered to them by the bow shock of the expanding radio cocoon . insofar as we have been able to estimate the line ratios in the high - velocity component , they seem to be consistent with photoionization by the quasar continuum , as well as with ionization by shocks ( at least with those for which a substantial fraction of the line radiation comes from photoionization of pre - shock material by the thermal continuum of the shock itself ) .",
    "an attractive option is that most of the emission comes from photoionization by the quasar either of ablated material from small clouds or simply of ambient diffuse gas , which likely can be driven to high velocities by the wind generated by the expanding bubble around the jet .",
    "the possibility that 3c48a  might also be a consequence of the radio jet , in the form of jet - induced star formation , now seems rather remote .",
    "the age of the stars in this feature is incompatible with jet - induced star formation by the current radio jet , and any appeal to production by a hypothetical previous radio jet would have to explain why the feature remains so coherent and relatively close to the radio axis after @xmath77 years .",
    "instead , a scenario in which we are seeing the distorted nucleus of the merging companion galaxy seems much more likely .",
    "@xcite show that a plausible model of a merger of two equal - mass disk galaxies can both reproduce the approximate appearance of the 3c48  host and , for a brief period , place the nuclei of the merging galaxies at the separation and approximate position angle of the quasar and 3c48a . while it would be useful to explore a larger range of parameter space to see if the model can be tuned to give a more exact reproduction of the observed properties , this result is already sufficient to give us confidence that this picture is basically correct .",
    "these results reinforce the conclusion that we are viewing 3c48  at a rather rare stage in the life of a quasar and its host galaxy .",
    "the age of the radio jet ( which presumably also dates the triggering of the current quasar activity ) appears to be at most a few @xmath94 years , and the two nuclei will fully merge on a time scale of @xmath95 years .",
