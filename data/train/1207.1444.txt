    "the majority of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , those belonging to the ` long ' burst class , likely originate in the deaths of very massive stars .",
    "these massive stars end their lives in a type ib / c supernova ( sn ) explosion , whose signature can be seen at optical wavelengths alongside the grb emission in a number of nearby examples with well sampled light curves and/or spectroscopy ( e.g. hjorth & bloom 2011 ) .",
    "supernova signatures have also been claimed in the high energy emission of the extremely long , subenergetic and rather unusual gamma - ray burst grb060218 in the form of a thermal x - ray component present in the spectrum over the first thousand seconds ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ) that some attribute to shock breakout of the supernova as it emerges from the star ( e.g. waxman , mszros & campana 2007 ; nakar & sari 2010 ; nakar & sari 2012 ) , first suggested by colgate ( 1974 ) .",
    "grb060218 displayed indisputable spectroscopic evidence for a supernova at optical wavelengths ( pian et al .",
    "2006 ; mazzali et al . 2006 ; sollerman et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the origin of the thermal x - ray emission remains an open issue .",
    "shock breakout must occur in these systems , but its observable signature is not well known .",
    "supernova shock break out may have been observed in a few ` ordinary ' supernovae at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths ( e.g. schawinski et al .",
    "2008 ; gezari et al . 2008,2010 ; ofek et al .",
    "2010 ) , but thus far these have been sne of type ii , and therefore not linked to the grb systems .",
    "shock break out is the interpretation given to a short burst of x - rays observed from a supernova not associated with a grb , sn2008d , serendipitously caught in the act of exploding ( soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ; chevalier & fransson 2008 ; modjaz et al . 2009",
    "; suzuki & shigeyama 2010 ; balberg & loeb 2011 ; couch et al .",
    "2011 among others ) . these serendipitous _ swift _ data on sn2008d provided the earliest ever observations of a supernova , seen to rise sharply at x - ray energies followed by an exponential decay .",
    "in contrast to grb060218 , the x - ray spectrum was not thermal but well described by a power law throughout .",
    "shock breakout can lead to either thermal or non - thermal spectra depending on the conditions in the shock and the progenitor star ( e.g. waxman et al . 2007 ; nakar & sari 2010 ; nakar & sari 2012 ) , but there are other emission sites from which similar spectra are expected , namely the cocoon surrounding the jet ( e.g. peer , mszros & rees 2006 ) . furthermore , it is unclear whether the energies required to produce the observed thermal x - ray components in grbs can be obtained through the shock breakout process ( e.g. ghisellini , ghirlanda & tavecchio 2007 ) .",
    "these authors instead invoke the central engine to produce the observed x - ray emission .",
    "recently , the notion of a ` failed grb ' has been suggested for low - luminosity grbs like 060218 ( also known as x - ray flashes ) , in which the grb jet never breaks out of the star yet the choked jet powers a relativistic shock breakout which emits in x - rays and/or gamma - rays ( bromberg , nakar & piran 2011 ; bromberg et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "a thermal x - ray component has also been noted in the prompt to afterglow transition phase of grb100316d which displayed similar , unusual high energy properties to grb060218 and is spectroscopically associated with an optical supernova ( starling et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra of these two bursts before about t@xmath01000s can not be fit with the absorbed power law or cut - off power law model that describes the vast majority of grbs .",
    "the addition of a thermal , blackbody component with a temperature of @xmath10.1 kev significantly improves the fits .",
    "so it appeared that very long - duration , sub - energetic , nearby grbs with associated supernovae harboured a source of thermal x - rays which regular grbs did not .",
    "a subsequently reported detection of a thermal x - ray component in grb090618 ( page et al . 2011 ) reopened the debate , however , on the origins of such emission .",
    "grb090618 is a ` typical ' grb in many respects and yet an absorbed power law model was not sufficient to describe its early x - ray spectrum .",
    "this grb has a photometric supernova association ( cano et al .",
    "2011a ) and lies relatively nearby , at @xmath2 , considering the grb redshift distribution which currently stretches from @xmath3 , peaking around @xmath4 ( e.g. fynbo et al .",
    "2009 ; jakobsson et al . 2012 ) . the large radius and necessarily high luminosity of the blackbody",
    "seen in 090618 is a real challenge to many shock breakout models , and in section [ sec : discussion ] we will also consider a model for emission from a cocoon surrounding the jet .",
    "we note that the early x - ray spectrum of grb101225a may also be better fit with the addition of a thermal component ( campana et al .",
    "2011a ; thne et al .",
    "2011 ) , but the redshift is unknown and its classification as a grb has not been confirmed however .    whatever its origin , an additional , likely thermal component is required to explain the early x - ray emission of at least three grbs ( campana et al . 2006 ; starling et al .",
    "2011 ; page et al .",
    "if it is indeed related to the supernova , and we expect all long grbs to originate in the deaths of massive stars , we should see this component in all long grb which are close enough and the grb emission is faint enough for it to be detected .",
    "we note , however , the curious cases of long grbs 060505 and 060614 which possessed all the attributes conducive to a sn search , yet no sn could be found to very deep limits ( e.g. della valle et al .",
    "2006 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2006 ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2006 ) , highlighting the need for a better understanding of the grb - sn connection .",
    "we attempt here a systematic search for thermal x - ray signatures in a sample of supernova - associated long grbs observed promptly with _ swift s _ x - ray telescope ( xrt , burrows et al . 2005 ; gehrels et al .",
    "we describe the sample in section [ sec : sample ] and outline the analysis method in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "results for each individual source are presented in section [ sec : results ] and a supernova - less grb is discussed in section [ sec:060614 ] . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarise the overall findings and outline the main caveats .",
    "we look at the prompt , afterglow , supernova and host galaxy emission of our sample for any relationship with the presence / absence of thermal x - ray components and we speculate on the origin of grb - sn thermal x - ray emission . in a second , related paper",
    "we extend this to all _ swift _ grbs with redshifts , and show simulations intended to reveal the conditions under which the blackbody components we are finding can be reliably recovered ( sparre & starling 2012 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we begin our systematic search for additional , thermal x - ray components by defining a sample of those grbs with    1 .   optical sn signatures , either spectroscopic or photometric , 2 .",
    "low redshifts , @xmath5 , and 3 .",
    "sufficient _ swift _ xrt windowed timing mode data up to 1000  s after the trigger to create a spectrum with count rate of a few count s@xmath6 or more .",
    "the resulting sample includes ten grbs : 060218 , 060729 , 070419a , 080319b , 081007 , 090618 , 100316d , 100418a , 101219b and 120422a .",
    "we also include grb091127 , for which _ swift _ observations did not start promptly and the wt data are beyond 1000s , since this source shows a very clear supernova signature in the optical ( sn2009nz , cobb et al .",
    "2010 ; berger et al . 2011",
    "; vergani et al . 2011 ) , and deserved to be investigated here .",
    "it has also been suggested that 091127 could be a higher redshift analogue of the subenergetic bursts such as 980425 and 060218 ( troja et al .",
    "unfortunately we could not apply the same argument to grb050525a , associated with sn2005nc ( della valle et al .",
    "2006 ) , because the first _ swift _ xrt observations of this source from which we could extract a spectrum were both late - time and in pc mode due to the faintness of the source at that time . for completeness",
    "we note two further _ swift _ grbs with sn associations for which prompt xrt spectra were not collected : 050824 ( sollerman et al .",
    "2007 ) and 111211a ( de ugarte postigo , thoene & gorosabel 2012 ) .",
    "the sample and their redshifts are listed in table [ tab : knownproperties ] .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]",
    "we report a new thermal x - ray component detection for grb101219b associated with sn2010ma , which we believe to be compelling .",
    "we also recover the bb components reported previously in grbs 060218 , 090618 and 100316d with consistent parameters . for our remaining 5 bb candidate sources from table [ tab : bbfits ] ( f - test statistic @xmath7 )",
    "we then omitted times of major flaring in the light curves , time - sliced according to light curve segment , allowed @xmath8 to vary when the error from the late - time measurement was very large and fit ecpl and bknpl models .",
    "we performed joint bat - xrt fits to all our sample where possible to locate the spectral peak energy and thereby better diagnose a spectral break in the early xrt data .",
    "we found we could reasonably explain the spectral curvature with one of the ecpl or bknpl models for grb070419a and the early time - slice of grb060729 .",
    "we conclude that four sources may show thermal x - ray emission within their early x - ray spectra , but can not rule out other explanations for this curvature .",
    "the reasons for this are most often because of large uncertainties in absorbing column and degeneracy between this and the underlying spectrum , or unconfirmed spectral breaks in the spectra .    *",
    "the role of x - ray absorbing columns * + the absorbing column along the line - of - sight towards a grb can be substantial , and reduces the observed x - ray flux in the region we are interested in for bb detection .",
    "it is therefore likely that details in the soft x - ray spectrum will be missed if the absorbing column is sufficiently high .",
    "the column density limit above which this happens is investigated in paper ii and must depend on power law index and source redshift .",
    "we note that the galactic column towards our grb - sne has a mean of 4@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 , which is insignificant when compared with the mean intrinsic measured column of @xmath14@xmath910@xmath12 @xmath11 and so should have no effect .",
    "signal to noise in many of our spectra is not good enough to keep @xmath8 free and add a bb , hence in the first fits in this work we kept @xmath8 fixed at the late - time value ( table [ tab : knownproperties ] ) .",
    "this is clearly not ideal , and we had to identify the cases with very uncertain late - time absorbing column densities , @xmath8 , and allow for this .",
    "the bb in 100418a must be deemed uncertain due to the errors on @xmath8 , while 120422a is consistent with having very little or no intrinsic absorption . for the remaining sources ,",
    "we note that 060218 , 081007 and possibly 100316d all have greater intrinsic columns than the mean of the sample and , while the bb is clear in 060218 and 100316d , it is likely that the high column ( @xmath13(0.7@xmath140.2 ) @xmath15 @xmath11 ) is affecting our ability to either securely identify or rule out a bb component in 081007 .    * spectral evolution * + spectral evolution at early times in the x - ray production of grbs is common , where the power law slope of the spectrum is seen to steepen through the steep decay phase in the light curve ( e.g. zhang , liang & zhang 2007 ) .",
    "we can estimate the effect of spectral evolution on our sources by examination of their hardness ratios as created in the light curves section of the ukssdc swift xrt grb repository@xmath16 , and in some cases we split the spectra according to the different light curve segments ( different decay slopes ) . hardening during flares is a particular problem and we have done our best to eliminate flaring episodes from our spectra .",
    "the time - sliced analysis of grb101219b shows a softening of the power law , but this did not render the bb undetectable in the time - averaged data so we expect this effect will not be a significant issue .",
    "the presence of the spectral peak energy in the x - ray band during our observations would invalidate our assumption of a single underlying absorbed power law continuum , requiring a spectral break or added curvature for the case of a long - duration exposure in which the break energy is seen to move .",
    "we know that @xmath17 is present in the x - ray spectrum we use here for grb060218 yet we can still conclusively recover the bb component ( though it is evident from the poor fit statistic that the continuum model remains incorrect , likely due to significant spectral evolution ) .",
    "this was the most prominent thermal component ever detected , comprising up to half of the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the exponentially cut - off power law fits to the spectra ( table [ tab : cutoffpl ] ) , together with information from either prompt gamma - ray fits or our own bat - xrt fits ( table [ tab : epk ] ) have allowed us to reasonably assess the need for a spectral break in each spectrum .",
    "indeed , we find that a break is likely to be present in the early x - ray data of 070419a , 060729 pre - flare and 080319b ( in the latter we note that a two - jet model suggested in racusin et al .",
    "2008 rather implies a superposition of power laws , but other interpretations , namely that of bloom et al .",
    "2009 , require only one jet ) .",
    "* instrumental effects * + we note that the quasar 3c273 is , like some of our grb - sn , well described by an absorbed power law plus blackbody and may be used to assess the effect of calibration uncertainties on our sample .",
    "this source is a regular _ swift _ xrt calibration target , and was observed in 2005 simultaneously with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ for cross - calibration purposes .",
    "the bb in 3c273 has a temperature of @xmath18kev and contributes 4% of the xrt x - ray flux .",
    "the spectral fits for xrt wt mode agree to within the expected uncertainties with the _ xmm _ epic and _ rxte _ spectra ( we note that for high statistical spectra a systematic error of @xmath193% was found to be sufficient , see e.g. swift - xrt - caldb-09_v11 and subsequent calibration release notes ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the bb components required in the grb - sn sample are real spectral features , and can not be an instrumental effect .",
    "although we have small number statistics here with only 11 sources in our sample , we can examine the grb , sn and host galaxy properties and look for commonalities between the source and bb properties .",
    "we split our grbs into three ` detection categories ' : detected bb , possible bb and no bb , as they are set out in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "no correlations arise between any of the properties we looked at : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , t@xmath24 , t@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath8 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30/@xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , f - statistic , @xmath34 , sn detection technique ( spectroscopic or photometric ) , @xmath35 when host is detected and bb required ( yes , possibly or no ) .",
    "there is , unsurprisingly , a general trend with redshift : the two most distant sample sources at @xmath36 do not have detectable bb signatures , while bbs in the two very nearby sources at @xmath37 are clearly detected .",
    "a 0.2kev bb will peak at @xmath10.1kev for our @xmath36 grbs , leaving just a portion of the bb tail detectable in the xrt range .",
    "this may explain the lack of bb detection in grbs 070419a and 080319b , compounded by high absorbing column density in 070419a .",
    "intrinsic column is likely to play an important role in bb detectability as discussed above and in paper ii .",
    "power law photon index also shows a trend , with values of @xmath38 in the detected category while we find @xmath39 in the possible bb category and something in between , @xmath40 , for the grbs with no detected bb .",
    "since the early power law index often evolves from hard to soft in grbs ( e.g. zhang et al . 2007 ) , it may be that the possible bbs are detected at later stages in the development of the prompt emission .",
    "the steeper power law indices make determination of the slopes more difficult and typical errors on @xmath28 are @xmath41 compared with @xmath42 for the detected bb category sources . the temporal power law index , however , has no bearing on the detection of a bb , with various light curve types sampled in each category ( figure [ lcs ] ) .",
    "considering the prompt gamma - ray properties of these sources ( as measured with _ swift _",
    "bat for consistency across all grbs , sakamoto et al .",
    "2011 ) , while the first two bbs were discovered in subenergetic , long - duration grbs , the candidates proposed since then have extended into the typical cosmological grb range .",
    "grb090618 is still the most energetic at @xmath43 erg , and the span of @xmath23 in the rest of our candidates is 10@xmath44 - 10@xmath45 erg .",
    "this strongly implies that thermal x - ray emission ( or significant spectral curvature ) can arise in any grb , and its detection is dependent upon properties other than the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "we notice a distinctly lower bb luminosity and radius for the two low @xmath23 grbs 060218 and 100316d with detected bbs when compared with the grbs with possible bbs , while grb 101219b appears to lie in between the two categories .",
    "grb 090618 does not follow the trend , with a very high bb luminosity , unsurprising given its very high afterglow flux , but a relatively low inferred radius . the one bb parameter that correlates well with detection category is the fractional unabsorbed 0.3 - 10 kev x - ray flux contributed by the bb .",
    "this lies between 8 and 14% for the unambiguous cases , and between 32% and 65% in all possible detections .",
    "interestingly , the restframe temperature of the bb remains similar for all detections , at around 0.2kev , with the exception of 090618 in which we see a somewhat higher @xmath46 , decreasing from 0.90.5kev .",
    "for a number of grb - sne the sn properties have been measured ( hjorth & bloom 2011 ; cano et al .",
    "2011b ; bufano et al .",
    "2012 ; sparre et al . 2011 ; cobb et al . 2010 ; de ugarte postigo et al . 2011 , in preparation ; richardson 2009 ; ferrero et al .",
    "2006 ; melandri et al .",
    "2012 ; schulze et al . in preparation ) , but beyond sn peak absolute magnitude the overlap with this sample is small since we also include photometric - only sn detections for which detailed ejecta information is not available .",
    "the grbs with spectroscopically - determined supernovae are 060218 , 081007 , 091127 , 100316d , 100418a , 101219b and 120422a , spanning all 3 categories of bb detection .",
    "sn peak absolute magnitudes are not available for 070419a , 081007 and 101219b",
    ". host galaxy magnitude , which may be used as an approximate tracer for metallicity , is available for around half the sample : 060218 , 060729 , 080319b , 090618 , 091127 and 100316d hampering comparison with other properties .",
    "we can only say that 2 out of 3 grbs with a clear bb have fainter hosts than the 3 possible / no - bb grbs , the bright host of 060218 being the exception .",
    "the evolution of spectral parameters in our fits to grb101219b ( figure [ bbevol101219b ] ) may be compared with similar analyses performed for grbs 060218 and 100316d ( figure 4 of starling et al .",
    "2011 ; figure 4 of olivares et al . 2012",
    "; see also kaneko et al .",
    "2007 ) and grb090618 ( figure 8 of page et al . 2011 ) .",
    "while the passage of the spectral peak energy through the x - ray band in the very soft grbs 060218 and 1001316d complicates the comparison , grb101219b shows a more similar behaviour to 090618 for most spectral parameters . the exception is bb luminosity , which steadily decreased in 090618 over 125275s since trigger .",
    "we find a general increase in 101219b from 160544s , followed by a decrease ( though this decrease is only seen in the pc spectra which we stress can only be used as a guide to the bb behaviour ) .",
    "the increase does coincide with a flattening of the light curve which may be interpreted as a short plateau , flaring episode or other transition phase between the @xmath47 and @xmath48 decays which may complicate the interpretation of our results .",
    "the luminosity variation has , however , little effect on the radius determination , which is almost exactly the same value and trend as is seen in 090618 , increasing from 9@xmath910@xmath49 cm to 7@xmath910@xmath50 cm in at most @xmath1900s , ( mean of 556s ) implying an expansion velocity of 0.4@xmath51c .",
    "firstly , the radii that result are large compared with the 10@xmath49 cm estimated for wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. cappa et al .",
    "2004 ) , a likely progenitor type for long grbs , but the existence of a thick wind could increase the radius probed in this way , as was suggested by some authors for the previous thermal x - ray components within the shock breakout model ( but see e.g. li 2007 ) .",
    "secondly , the inferred expansion velocity is very high , at least 20% of the speed of light , and together these considerations cast some doubt on the origin of this thermal emission in the shock breakout of grb101219b .",
    "we reiterate that these radii are illustrative only , since they assume both a single temperature bb and thermal equilibrium : at the high luminosities recovered here it seems likely a shock breakout would be highly relativistic , where thermal equilibrium does not hold and indeed the predicted temperatures put the observable signature at energies above the soft x - ray band ( nakar & sari 2012 , before consideration of the effects of a wind ) .    an alternative origin for thermal emission may be in a cocoon surrounding the jet .",
    "a number of our bb candidates are discovered during the steep decay phase of the x - ray light curve ( figure [ lcs ] ) .",
    "peer , mszros & rees ( 2006 ) showed that steep x - ray light curve decays ( @xmath52 ) can be produced by a relativistically expanding hot plasma cocoon associated with the jet .",
    "they demonstrate that some time after the prompt emission , typically a few hundred seconds , the bulk of the cocoon emission would fall in the x - ray band .",
    "the original spectrum is assumed to be a power law with power law index @xmath53 , as is expected , e.g. , from synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , during the expansion phase of the cocoon the photons lose energy to the expanding plasma , and the spectrum is modified , resulting in a low energy thermal component combined with a power law over the 0.310kev range .",
    "origin in such a cocoon would allow measured bb radii to be larger than is expected for shock breakout , @xmath5410@xmath50 cm , in line with many of our measurements .",
    "the high luminosities of the bb candidates would also be more easily explained in this model compared with the shock breakout model .",
    "the eventual predicted temporal x - ray decay is steep in this model , @xmath55 , which applies to some of our sample grbs : 060729 , 081007 , 090618 , 100418a , 101219b and 120422a .",
    "interestingly , almost flat early light curves are seen in grbs 060218 and 100316d , i.e. in the most convincing cases thus far for the shock breakout model .",
    "additionally , very steep decays do not occur in the data in - hand for 070419a , 080319b or 091127 , all grbs where a bb could not be detected .    comparing the cocoon model of peer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to our data for grb101219b we find that for reasonable model parameters both the overall spectral shape and the light curve decay can be reproduced .",
    "we have restricted the modelling to the time frame 100250s since trigger in this first approximate analysis , simply to see whether or not the general trends can be recovered . in figure [ cocoonmodel ]",
    "we show some of these models , which stem from photons injected deep in the flow having an initial photon energy distribution of a power law with index @xmath53 above 10@xmath56 m@xmath57 c@xmath58 .",
    "the resulting spectrum comprises low energy thermal spectra with modified power laws at higher energies , and the steep flux decay is produced , when the initial optical depth of the cocoon , @xmath59 , is 3050 .",

    "its general properties appear to be intermediate between the low luminosity grbs 060218 and 100316d and the classical grb090618 , all of which have previously reported thermal x - ray emission that we also recover here .",
    "we can not identify any strong correlations of bb properties with the available prompt emission , sn or host properties .",
    "we note some trends between bb ` category ' and redshift , power law spectral index and percentage contribution of the bb to the 0.310kev flux ; these likely do not refer to the intrinsic attributes of the grbs , but rather to the detachability of the thermal component .",
    "all the possible bb candidates among our sample have large bb luminosities ( @xmath76 erg @xmath11 ) and inferred radii ( @xmath77 cm ) .",
    "these luminosities are difficult to reconcile with shock breakout models since they imply highly relativistic outflows that would emit largely at energies above the _ swift _ xrt bandpass .",
    "our bb candidates occur during the steep decay phase of the x - ray light curve .",
    "we discuss a model for this emission arising in a relativistically expanding hot plasma cocoon associated with the jet .",
    "this model is able to generally reproduce the extreme bb parameters we retrieve from our fits , and is consistent with a steep temporal decay . only grbs 060218 and 100316d do not show a temporal decay of @xmath55 during the first @xmath11000s , where the bb luminosities and radii are significantly lower than in the rest of our grb - sn sample , and the shock breakout model has been argued by a number of authors to be valid ( section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "indeed , these two low luminosity grbs may be the product of quite different physics early on from the classical energetic grbs that populate most of our sample , with grb101219b lying somewhere in the transition .",

    "<S> the x - ray spectra of gamma - ray bursts can generally be described by an absorbed power law . </S>",
    "<S> the landmark discovery of thermal x - ray emission in addition to the power law in the unusual grb060218 , followed by a similar discovery in grb100316d , showed that during the first thousand seconds after trigger the soft x - ray spectra can be complex . </S>",
    "<S> both the origin and prevalence of such spectral components still evade understanding , particularly after the discovery of thermal x - ray emission in the classical grb 090618 . </S>",
    "<S> possibly most importantly , these three objects are all associated with optical supernovae , begging the question of whether the thermal x - ray components could be a result of the grb - sn connection , possibly in the shock breakout . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore performed a search for blackbody components in the early _ swift _ x - ray spectra of 11 grbs that have or may have associated optical supernovae , accurately recovering the thermal components reported in the literature for grbs 060218 , 090618 and 100316d . </S>",
    "<S> we present the discovery of a cooling blackbody in grb101219b / sn2010ma , and in four further grb - sne we find an improvement in the fit with a blackbody which we deem possible blackbody candidates due to case - specific caveats . </S>",
    "<S> all the possible new blackbody components we report lie at the high end of the luminosity and radius distribution . </S>",
    "<S> grb101219b appears to bridge the gap between the low - luminosity and the classical grb - sne with thermal emission , and following the blackbody evolution we derive an expansion velocity for this source of order 0.4c . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss potential origins for the thermal x - ray emission in our sample , including a cocoon model which we find can accommodate the more extreme physical parameters implied by many of our model fits .    </S>",
