    "main sequence stars with mass in the range 0.9 - 9 m@xmath2 evolve through a double shell burning phase , refered to as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution .",
    "this phase is characterized by carbon dredge up of the core to the surface after each thermal pulse - helium shell flash - ( iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "the temperatures of these objects are very badly known .",
    "although they are highly variable , their determination from static models such as assumed in the basel library can be justified as a first approximation . in order to explore the capabilities of the basel library ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 and references therein , see also lastennet , lejeune & cuisinier , these proceedings ) to predict correct temperatures for such cool agb stars , we compare our results from synthetic infrared photometry of the stellar photosphere with the detailed study of lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1994 ) of the agb carbon star r fornacis .",
    "their work is based on a modelling of the spectral energy distribution of the dust envelope , where they put tight constraints on the temperature of the heating source .",
    "table 1 gives the jhklm photometry of r for ( hip 11582 ) that we used ( le bertre , 1992 ) .",
    "the photometric errors in the individual jhklm magnitudes are not provided so we assume an error of 0.2 on each magnitude , according to the maximum uncertainty estimated from fig . 1 of le bertre ( 1988 ) .    ccccccc j & h & k & l & m & t@xmath0@xmath3 & t@xmath0@xmath4 + & & & & & ( k ) & ( k ) + 5.76 & 3.97 & 2.32 & 0.21 & @xmath50.28 & 2650 & 2440 - 2520 +    @xmath3 lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1994 ) ; + @xmath4 basel jhkm synthetic photometry ( this work , see text for details ) .",
    "although the dust may have a significant contribution in the ir _ bands _ of this star , especially l and m , it should only have a secondary influence on the photospheric _",
    "colours_. we intend of course to correct for the predicted differences by a dust model ( lorenz - martins & lefvre , 1993 ) due to the envelope .",
    "however in a first step we merely compare the observed colours of r fornacis with the photospheric predictions of the basel library ( basel-2.2 version , with spectral corrections ) by minimizing their @xmath6 differences .",
    "+ this @xmath6-minimization method is similar to the one applied in lastennet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : we derived the t@xmath0 and log g values matching simultaneously the observed jhklm photometry listed in tab . 1 , assuming a solar metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath70 ) .",
    "we have tested various colour combinations of the j ( 1.25 @xmath8 ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath8 ) , k ( 2.2 @xmath8 ) , l ( 3.4 @xmath8 ) , and m ( 5.0 @xmath8 ) magnitudes : ( j@xmath5h ) , ( h@xmath5k ) , ( k@xmath5l ) , ( j@xmath5k ) and ( k@xmath5 m ) .",
    "they all give t@xmath0 estimates in agreement with the work of lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1994 ) .",
    "+ since better constraints should be obtained by matching more than 1 colour , we chose the ( j@xmath5h ) and ( k@xmath5 m ) colours which give the best @xmath6-scores .",
    "the solutions we get to match simultaneously the observed ( j@xmath5h ) and ( k@xmath5 m ) are presented in fig .",
    "our best basel - infrared solution is t@xmath0@xmath72440k , but all the solutions inside the 1-@xmath9 contour are good fits to the observed photometric data .",
    "the effective temperature of the central star of r for found by lorenz - martins & lefvre is t@xmath0@xmath72650 k ( shown as a vertical line on fig .",
    "1 ) . this is larger by @xmath1100k than the 1-@xmath9 basel contour but still inside the 2-@xmath9 contour .",
    "additionally the basel models show that this star has a surface gravity log g @xmath1@xmath50.5@xmath100.4 , which is what one expects for carbon stars .",
    "we reported a preliminary study to determine the t@xmath0 and surface gravity of the central star of r fornacis by exploring the best @xmath6-fits to the infrared photometric data .",
    "these results are in a surprising good agreement - given the approximation we made ( no envelope absorption / emission correction ) - with the detailed study of lorenz - martins & lefvre ( 1994 ) .",
    "therefore , while detailed spectra studies are obviously highly preferred ( see e.g. loidl , lanon & jrgensen , 2001 ) , our method may provide a good starting point .",
    "if our r fornacis result is confirmed with other agb stars , this would mean that the basel jhklm synthetic photometry is suited to derive ( teff - log g ) estimates for cool agb stars .",
