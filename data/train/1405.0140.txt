    "in recent years a growing interest has been focused on crystalline systems lacking inversion symmetry ( see for example ref .  ) . a direct consequence of non - centrosymmetry is the occurrence of a spin - orbit dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "the dm interaction is thought to play an important role in multiferroic systems and may be at play in the occurrence of non - trivial magnetic structures . on the other hand , non - centrosymmetric systems presenting superconductivity have attracted special attention as the absence of parity symmetry considerably restricts the possible superconducting states ( i.e. a pure triplet pairing is in principle not allowed without inversion symmetry ) @xcite .",
    "mnsi is probably the non - centrosymmetric system which concentrates most of the research focus .",
    "it was the first material found to exhibit a homochiral spin spiral structure below @xmath3  k @xcite .",
    "this spin spiral adopts a very long wavelength of about 18  nm .",
    "in addition to an external pressure destroying the magnetic state ( @xmath4  gpa @xcite ) , a modest magnetic field of 6  kg is found to overcome the dm interaction leading to a spin - aligned state @xcite .",
    "moreover a skyrmion phase was recently identified near @xmath2 in the magnetic phase diagram @xcite .",
    "contrary to what observed in a number of strongly correlated electron systems ( see for example ref .  ) , mnsi does not display superconductivity at @xmath5 .",
    "it was invoked @xcite that the absence of a superconducting state for mnsi under pressure has to be traced back to the absence of parity operator for the wavefunctions .    in view of all these properties",
    ", mnsi has been investigated several times by @xmath0sr in zero or externally applied pressures ( see for example refs .  ) .",
    "two main controversies occurred from these studies .",
    "the first one regards the behavior of the magnetic state near the critical pressure @xmath5 .",
    "first measurements performed by uemura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite seemed to show a phase separation between magnetic and paramagnetic regions whereas measurements performed by andreica _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , extending at lower temperatures , showed a complete absence of phase separation .",
    "the second controversy regards the muon stopping site(s ) and the occurrence or not of magnetic polaron .",
    "the large majority of the studies associates the two spontaneous frequencies seen below @xmath2 to two magnetically inequivalent sites .",
    "the same is deduced from transverse - field ( tf ) measurements performed at low fields @xcite , even though the conclusions obtained from this latter study are blurred by the assumption of a vanishing dipolar tensor . on the other side , storchak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite relate the observation of two frequencies in tf data to a coupled @xmath6 system ( i.e. mu state ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the spin of the mu electron does not exhibit rapid fluctuations through spin exchange with the itinerant electrons , but is kept  fixed \" by the local ferromagnetic ordering mediated by itself ( the electron and the four mn neighbors are thought to be coupled and to behave as a single entity with large spin : i.e. a  spin polaron \" ) . in this scenario",
    ", the two frequencies correspond to two muon spin - flip transitions between states with fixed electron spin orientation .",
    "the picture of such a localized electron state appears controversial given the metallic nature of mnsi .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to lift the controversy regarding the occurrence or not of magnetic polaron and provide information on the muon stopping site .",
    "we retain this an essential point to solve , as this will show whether @xmath0sr can be utilized to specifically extract quantitative information on this heavily studied strongly correlated system . in this study",
    ", we will show that the occurrence of different frequencies in the tf-@xmath0sr spectra can be traced back to the different responses of crystallographically equivalent muon - stopping sites which become magnetically inequivalent in the presence of an external magnetic field and that one does not need to invoke a magnetic polaron to explain the tf-@xmath0sr data .",
    "we will also show that the occurrence of two spontaneous muon frequencies in the zero - field @xmath0sr data recorded below @xmath2 can be explained within this frame . finally , we also present density - functional theory calculations which perfectly support the experimental evidences .",
    "we used the same mnsi sample as in the previous @xmath0sr under pressure experiments @xcite .",
    "it consists of a single crystal with the form of a cylinder of approximately 7 mm diameter and 19 mm length ( see fig .  [ sample ] ) .",
    "the single crystal was grown by the czochralsky pulling technique from a stoichiometric melt of high - purity elements ( @xmath7% ) using radio - frequency heating and a cold copper crucible .",

    "sr measurements .",
    "the sample was rotated along the cylinder axis . ]",
    "the study of the angular dependence of the muon knight - shift in mnsi was performed using the gps instrument located at the @xmath11m3 beamline of the hipa complex at the paul scherrer institut ( psi , villigen , switzerland ) .",
    "the measurements were performed with the transverse - field geometry with a magnetic field of 5200  g. the sample was rotated around the cylinder axis and the external field @xmath12 was applied perpendicular to the cylinder .",
    "note that the sample was not grown along a specified crystallographic orientation , i.e. the cylinder axis does not correspond to a principal axis .",
    "the measurements presented here were performed using a dynamical he - flow cryostat ( i.e. sample in he - flow ) at a temperature of 50  k. the temperature stability of the sample was better than 0.1  k for all the measurements .",

    "the occurrence of four frequencies in the @xmath0sr signal clearly points to a muon site located at the @xmath20 wyckoff position of the cubic structure . in this view",
    ", the main contribution of the observed angular dependence arises from the dipolar contribution .",
    "as shown in table  [ diptensor ] , which provides information on this type of sites and the respective dipolar tensor forms , taking into account the symmetry of the dipolar tensors , the four crystallographically equivalent 4@xmath1 sites in the unit cell are either : i ) magnetically equivalent when @xmath12 is applied along a principal direction ; ii ) grouped in two pairs of magnetically inequivalent sites for @xmath12 applied in a principal plane ; iii )  usually all magnetically inequivalent for @xmath12 applied along an arbitrary direction .

    "as each signal should provide us with the same parameters , we have a rather precise determination of these parameters , i.e. @xmath25  mole / emu , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 could be confirmed _ a posteriori _ by performing x - rays laue measurements of the crystal .",
    "but we stress that the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 extracted by @xmath0sr must be considered as more precise as , for example , they take into account any possible misalignment of the sample mounting compared to the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "the experimentally determined value of @xmath23 can be directly compared with dipolar sum calculations .",
    "figure  [ adip_theor ] , which exhibits the theoretical value of @xmath23 calculated for different sites 4@xmath1 , indicates that this experimental value is compatible with muons sitting either at the site @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "we stress that a small uncertainty on the magnetic susceptibility ( and therefore finally on the obtained value of @xmath23 ) will only weakly affect the determination of the muon - site ( for example , an uncertainty as high as @xmath3010% on @xmath31 leads to a shift of @xmath32 on the muon - site coordinates ) .",

    ", we would also like to mention the possibility of a small lattice dilation around the muon .",
    "we notice first that such effects are usually extremely small in metals ( of the order of the percent , if detectable at all ; see for example ref .  ) .",
    "a hypothetical weak dilation of the lattice would decrease the calculated absolute values of the @xmath23 parameter , which would push slightly the muon position in the direction of the plane formed by the three adjacent mn - ions ( see fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) .",
    "however , the main conclusion that the muon is stopped at a 4@xmath1 position would not be affected .",
    "finally , we note that a by - product of our analysis is the determination of the contact field @xmath41 .",
    "basically two interactions contribute to the contact field .",
    "the first one is a result of the pauli paramagnetism of the conduction electrons and their fermi contact interaction with the muon @xcite . in systems with localized moments , as mnsi , an additional contribution arises as the spin - polarization of the conduction electrons at the muon site will be increased through the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction due to the local magnetic moments . as the pauli susceptibility of the conduction electrons is much smaller than the magnetic susceptibility from the local @xmath42 moments ( i.e. @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the fermi interaction can be safely neglected in the contact field , which therefore can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hyperfine contact coupling tensor . by writing eq .",
    "( [ eq_bloc ] ) , we note that we implicitely assumed that the contact field is independent of the direction of @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) as observed in a number of compounds with local moments ( see for example ref .   and references therein ) . in any case ,",
    "even if one assumes that the weak angular dependence of @xmath48 is solely arising from a hypothetical angular dependence of @xmath45 , this would correspond to a variation of less than 4% of the hyperfine contact coupling tensor during the rotation . as we _ know _ that some angular dependence has to arise from the demagnetization factor ( see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ) , this number has to be considered as an upper limit . by assuming that the hyperfine contact coupling tensor is isotropic , and taking into account that for our sample geometry the average value of the demagnetization factor is @xmath49 one obtains a value of @xmath50  mole / emu , which can now be included in the computation of the expected values of the spontaneous fields occurring at the muon sites below @xmath2 as described in the next section .",
    "at this point , having a solid knowledge of the muon stopping site , it appears legitimate to thoroughly discuss the number and values of the spontaneous @xmath0-frequencies observed below @xmath2 @xcite in zero - applied field ( zf ) @xmath0sr experiments .",
    "all the @xmath0sr studies reported to date reveal the occurrence of two spontaneous @xmath0-frequencies with values @xmath51  mhz and @xmath52  mhz for @xmath53  k. our first task here will be to discuss why solely two frequencies are observed .",
    "the magnetic structure of mnsi is characterized by spins forming a left - handed incommensurate helix with a propagation vector @xmath54  @xmath55 in the [ 111 ] direction @xcite .",
    "the static mn - moments ( @xmath56 for @xmath57  k ) point in a plane perpendicular to the propagation vector .",
    "the period , which is incommensurate to the lattice constant , is about 18  nm . due to the incommensurability of the magnetic structure ,",
    "one expects a continuous set of local fields at our 4@xmath1 sites , and therefore the field distribution @xmath58 at each site must be considered ( here the index @xmath59 distinguishes the four sub - sites 4@xmath1 ) .",
    "it was shown that such a magnetic structure leads to a field distribution given by @xcite @xmath60 and is characterized by two peaks due to the minimum and maximum cutoff field values .",
    "hence , at a first glance , one would expect to observe up to eight peaks in the fourier spectra of the zf-@xmath0sr data .",
    "however , as the sites @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are located symmetrically around the direction [ 111 ] of the propagation vector ( which represents for them a 3-fold symmetry axis ) , it can be shown that muons stopping at these sites will sense identical field distributions , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_fd ] ) , i.e. @xmath64 . on the other hand , muons stopping at the site @xmath65 will all sense a unique field value irrespective to the phase of the helix at the muon stopping site .",
    "hence , purely geometrical considerations already reduce the maximum number of peaks in the fourier spectra of the zf-@xmath0sr data down to three . note that this conclusion is not affected if the sample is not monodomain .",
    "hence for the other possible magnetic domains ( which , by taking into account the helicity , are characterized by propagation vectors along [ @xmath66 , [ @xmath67 and [ @xmath68 ) one obtains the same field distributions as for the original domain , albeit the symmetry of the sites with respect to the magnetic structure will be accordingly permuted .    ) ] and approximated [ red line : see eq .",

    "this is reasonable assuming that no massive changes occur on the fermi surface when crossing @xmath2 and considering that due to the long wavelength , the close mn - neighbors around the muon , which are determining the strength of the rkky interaction , are essentially ferromagnetically aligned in the magnetic phase .",
    "this is the only choice made for the calculation , as the _ local _ magnetization @xmath80 is also fully determined by the details of the magnetic structure and is given by @xmath81 where the volume @xmath82 is the volume occupied by the @xmath83 mn - ions involved in the sum .",
    "the direction of the mn - moments @xmath84 is determined by the details of the magnetic structure .",

    "the present calculations where performed on a sphere containing more than @xmath88 unit cells . by setting @xmath89 , we stress again that our calculation does not contain any free parameters as the magnetic structure is taken from the literature , the muon site is determined by our tf - data and the contact coupling constant is taken _ as is _ from the tf - data . from this calculation ,",

    "<S> the observed angular dependence of the muon precession frequencies matches perfectly the one of the mn - dipolar fields acting on the muons stopping at a 4@xmath1 position of the crystallographic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the data provide a precise determination of the magnetic dipolar tensor . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have calculated the shape of the field distribution expected below the magnetic transition temperature @xmath2 at the 4@xmath1 muon - site when no external magnetic field is applied . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this field distribution is consistent with the one reported by zero - field @xmath0sr studies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present _ ab initio _ calculations based on the density - functional theory which confirm the position of the muon stopping site inferred from transverse - field @xmath0sr . in view of the presented evidence </S>",
