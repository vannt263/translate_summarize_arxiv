    "@xcite recently , ggg with its unique phase diagram in magnetic field attracted a lot of interest from the point of view of geometric magnetic frustration on a garnet lattice.@xcite in the present work we demonstrate a close relation between an enhanced magnetocaloric effect and strong geometric frustration .",

    "cubic terms vanish in the expansion by a spin - rotational symmetry .",
