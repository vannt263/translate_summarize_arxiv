    "one of the great unknowns in our understanding of star formation concerns the role played by galactic environmental parameters . for instance , molecular cloud processes , e.g. cooling and magnetic field diffusion , depend on the presence of metals , thus it is unlikely star formation is not affected by metallicity .",
    "the magellanic clouds have metallicity and density of the interstellar media ( ism ) that are lower than in the milky way .",
    "thus , they provide a star formation template that is more representative of the formation of stars at higher redshifts and offer a step closer towards exploring the formation of the first generation of stars at zero metallicity .",
    "young pre - main - sequence populations have recently been identified in hii regions in the magellanic clouds @xcite . however , relatively little work has been done in investigating the earlier , more embedded stages of star formation in the magellanic clouds . at the distance of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , @xmath250kpc ) , one is limited to study only the most massive stellar embryos that will form massive o and b stars .",
    "infrared ( ir ) observations are an excellent way to investigate the properties of such objects , both because they are heavily embedded and thus invisible at shorter wavelengths and also because they are surrounded by dense envelopes of gas , dust and ices that are revealed at these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "recently , a few massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the lmc have been investigated @xcite .",
    "molecular masers ( in particular water , hydroxyl and methanol ) are very bright emission lines that seem to be closely associated with the earliest stages of massive star formation @xcite when the ysos are difficult to detect even at ir wavelengths .",
    "maser emission is found in the vicinity of embedded ysos and thus they are powerful beacons of current star formation in a molecular cloud .",
    "several water maser sources have been discovered in the magellanic clouds ( see below ) . in this contribution",
    "we describe a new survey of water masing sources in the lmc at 22ghz with the parkes telescope .    in recent years",
    ", the 30 doradus nebula ( n157 ) has become the paradigm of large scale triggered star formation . as the largest and nearest extragalactic hii region in the local group it offers a rare insight into the spatial and temporal properties of starbursts .",
    "@xcite identified the so - called star - formation fronts , the interfaces between the energetic outflows from the central compact cluster r136 ( first generation star formation episode ) and the surrounding molecular clouds , in which there is evidence of ongoing triggered star formation .",
    "water maser emission has also been detected at various locations in 30dor @xcite .",
    "the wealth of bright protostars identified in the region @xcite hints at the possibility that more masing activity hitherto undetected might be present .",
    "we describe our mapping survey of the inner region of 30dor , in which we have identified 4 distinct maser sources , one of them new .",
    "three other hii regions in the lmc , known to show water maser emission ( n113 , n105a and n160a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also observed at 22ghz , as well as most of the previous non - detections for water maser emission in the lmc and smc @xcite . since our observations , @xcite also reported 22ghz water maser emission towards n159 .",
    "the hii region n113 @xcite shows a complex structure of h@xmath3 bubbles with a rich molecular gas and dust morphology .",
    "several young clusters are associated with n113 @xcite and current star formation activity is occuring within continuum sources in the central area of the nebula @xcite .",
    "the hii region n105 @xcite is a complex of evacuated bubbles and dense molecular material with several young clusters associated with it @xcite ; current star formation as indicated by maser activity seems to concentrate in the denser central part of the region , n105a .",
    "n160a is the brightest component in the n160 hii complex @xcite .",
    "besides maser emission , both an embedded protostar @xcite and a dense molecular core @xcite point at ongoing star formation . @xcite and @xcite describe the gas morphology and stellar content of n160 .    in order to investigate the relationship between the masers and the gas kinematics and star formation activity , we have obtained narrow - band h@xmath3 images at the aat of n113 , and l@xmath4-band images and 3@xmath04@xmath1 m spectroscopy at the eso - vlt in n157b and n105a .",
    "these new observations , combined with archival irac / spitzer images are used to relate the embedded population to the local gas and dust morphology .",
    "the new observations used in this paper are described in this section and a summary is given in table[overview ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of n105airs1 and n157birs1 were reproduced with the dust radiative transfer model dusty @xcite , as an attempt to derive approximate quantitative information about these ysos .",
    "the fits are shown along with the observed seds in fig.[sed_f ] , and the main fit parameters are summarised in table[sed_t ] . in both cases we could obtain a reasonable fit to the sed with a radial dust density profile @xmath5 ( steady accretion ) , and a standard mrn grain size distribution @xcite .",
    "the dust envelope was assumed to be spherically symmetric ; this is probably not strictly true .",
    "the bolometric luminosity was derived from scaling the model sed to fit the observed sed and using a value for the distance to the lmc of 50kpc .",
    "the main difference between the two objects is in the nature of the central source . in the case of",
    "n157birs1 we place a black body of 25,000k in the centre of the dust envelope .",
    "such hot star is required to reproduce the sed throughout the @xmath6 bands where the star becomes noticeable ; at longer wavelengths ( including the 3@xmath04@xmath1 m band ) the sed is dominated by dust emission .",
    "based on the sed analysis alone , we can not entirely rule out the possibility that this is an evolved dust - enshrouded red supergiant of around 10@xmath015m@xmath7 .",
    "however , this would imply a rather long ( @xmath8myr ) time - gap between the formation of this massive star and the star formation that is currently taking place in the 30dor region  @xcite identified 5 different stellar populations in the 30dor nebula , with ages in the range @xmath9 and 10myr .",
    "a chance coincidence of such rare object with n157b is extremely unlikely .",
    "furthermore the cautious identification of water ice ( sect.[n157spec ] ) argues against it .    in the case of n105airs1 , the 3@xmath04@xmath1 m spectrum clearly indicates the presence of an ionised region inside of the dust envelope .",
    "we thus represented the central source by a free - free emission object .",
    "there can be little doubt that this is a young object and the surrounding dust is not produced by the central star , and we therefore used a mixture of amorphous oxygen - rich silicates @xcite and carbon @xcite .",
    "the sed is rather well reproduced , especially throughout the 3@xmath04@xmath1 m band , and the optical extinction used in the model is consistent with that estimated from the hydrogen emission line ratios ( see sect.[n105spec ] ) .",
    "the dust envelope is cold , again consistent with a cavity created by the emerging hii region powered by a massive yso .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of n105airs1 suggests a central star of spectral type o5 and about 43m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath3 images of n113 ( fig.[n113 ] ) show a wealth of detail .",
    "the line emission is so strong that it is still apparent in the pseudo - continuum image ( though at a much fainter level ) .",
    "the main extended structures are three regions of h@xmath3 emission to the east , north and west of the centre of the hii region : n113f , n113c and n113d , respectively .",
    "this is emphasised by an obscuring lane running across the hii region , onto which are projected ( from east to west ) n113a , n113b and n113e : `` a chain of three small intense knots of nebulosity which , together , make up ngc1877 '' @xcite .",
    "there is a fourth such knot  which we name n113 g  in between n113a and n113f .",
    "although fainter , it stands out well against the dark dust lane .",
    "n113c and the lower surface brightness nebula bsdl945 @xcite to the east of n113f each contain a particularly striking example of a shell with a central star ( indicated in fig.[n113 ] as `` shell 1 '' and `` shell 2 '' ) .",
    "these shells are likely to be stellar wind - blown bubbles with a dynamical timescale of only a few @xmath10yr ( for a wind speed of order @xmath11kms@xmath12 ) .",
    "the central star of shell 1 can be identified with a b0@xmath00.5iii star @xcite , but the central star of the larger shell 2 remains anonymous .",
    "several ob stars in n113 have been described in the literature .",
    "near the edge of the h@xmath3 emission , the evolved b2[e ] supergiant hd269217 (= hens89 , r82 , iras05136@xmath06925 , msxlmc216 ) has enjoyed considerable attention .",
    "it was first mentioned in @xcite as a b star with strong balmer line emission",
    ". descended from a 30m@xmath7 main sequence star , it has been associated with circumstellar dust and found to move at a heliocentric speed of @xmath13kms@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another , little studied emission - line star hd269219",
    "(= hens90 ) is found further north and away from the hii region .",
    "closer to the core of the hii complex , hv2377 is an m - type suspected supergiant .",
    "both around and embedded within n113 are a number of o9@xmath0b0.5 stars  either on the main sequence or slightly evolved @xcite .",
    "the central area of the 30dor nebula ( n157a ) exhibits a complex star formation history .",
    "as already mentioned , @xcite disentangled five distinct stellar populations in the central area of 30dor .",
    "the population located mainly in the molecular filaments to the west and northeast of r136 shows spectroscopic evidence of extreme youth ( @xmath9 myr ) .",
    "these infant objects are spatially related with bright , compact ir sources within a complex nebular and dust morphology @xcite : pillars of molecular gas and dust and dark globules @xcite , which are being photo - evaporated by the intense radiation from the massive compact cluster r136 @xcite .",
    "together with the maser sources , this constitutes strong evidence that star formation is ongoing in the nebula .",

    ", the extended emission is dominated by hot dust and pah emission .",
    "this figure also shows the location of young , embedded ir sources ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath171.5mag ) identified in the literature @xcite as well as the maser sources . the water masers in 30dor are located in similar structures as the ir sources , surrounding r136 , suggesting that _ current _ star formation ( not just _ recent _ star formation ) is also concentrated near the interfaces of the molecular cloud complex within the influence sphere of the previous generation of massive o and b - type stars .",
    "the large velocity difference between maser source components ( sect.[maser_30dor ] ) implies location in distinct structures in the ism . as proposed by @xcite , the highly supersonic velocities of some of the sources and their location near the rim of large gas superbubbles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) strongly suggest that the masers occur at the collision fronts of rapidly expanding bubbles of ionised gas with the surrounding dense neutral material .",
    "if the masers trace the velocities of protostars within these environments , then this constitutes evidence that star formation was triggered at different locations by the massive stars feedback .",
    "our maser observations survey the central part of the 30dor nebula , covering the immediate neighbourhood of r136 and the densest regions of the nebula .",
    "even though the survey area is much larger than previous observations , we only identified one new maser source .",
    "we can compare our survey results to the galactic water maser luminosity distribution from @xcite . assuming a median distance to high - mass star forming regions in nearby spiral arms of a few kpc",
    ", we would expect the bulk of the water masers in 30dor to have integrated fluxes of order 0.1@xmath01 jykms@xmath12 , with a steep decline at the higher end .",
    "this suggests that , although close , our survey is not yet deep enough to reveal the bulk of the water maser population in 30dor .",
    "nonetheless , as all detected water masers are located at or near compressed interface regions , our survey provides evidence that most of the on - going massive star formation occurs in the presence of feedback .",
    "the situation is less clear for the molecular material in n157b , still in the 30dor region but located @xmath27@xmath18 ( 100pc ) from r136 .",
    "we identify n157birs1 as a candidate protostar from the analysis of its sed and from the tentative detection of water ice .",
    "we have detected no maser emission towards n157birs1 . despite the 0.9@xmath18 mismatch in position , our experience with the 30dor mapping ( see for instance analysis of 0539 - 691c ) indicates that we would have detected emission from this source if stronger than @xmath21jy .",
    "we can not exclude the presence of weaker emission , however water masers are normally associated with the earlier ( hot core ) stage when such objects are very weak in the ir @xcite  irs1 is the brightest source in our sample at near and- mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "n157b has been identified with snr0538 - 69.1 , although its nature as a supernova remnant has been questioned @xcite .",
    "the age of the alleged supernova remnant is only @xmath19yr @xcite and it is therefore impossible to already have led to the formation of stars in the nearby molecular cloud .",
    "it is possible that the formation of n157birs1 was triggered by feedback from the nearby ob association lh99 , but we have no direct evidence for this .",
    "n113 is a smaller and perhaps simpler hii region than the 30dor mini - starburst complex .",

    "we use here the pseudo - continuum image ( sect.[halpha ] ) : this image contains not only stars ( generally blue ) but also most of the h@xmath3 emission structure ; when combined with the ir image the ionised and neutral gas , as well as the stellar content become apparent .",

    "this just exceeds the threshold for a diffuse cloud to cool and collapse to form stars , @xmath27@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the cloud must be strongly clumped , which would imply that most ( geometrically ) of the cloud is much less dense  possibly @xmath28 .",
    "the dense molecular clump that was detected within this cloud has a radius of @xmath29pc and a molecular hydrogen density of @xmath30@xmath23 @xcite ; this yields a column density of @xmath31@xmath26 , which comfortably exceeds the threshold for star formation .",
    "the strongest density enhancements are located near the interface with the hot gas ; thus it is likely that the gas has been compressed as a result of feedback from the nearby ob stars .",
    "to summarise , the scenario that emerges in n113 is that in the compressed dense lane of neutral gas and dust star formation is occurring , pinpointed by the maser sources in its earliest stages and by the 1.3-cm continuum emission as the massive stars evolve .",
    "n113 therefore presents a clear example of star formation triggered by the winds from massive stars .",
    "a similar scenario seems also likely for n160a ( fig.[mir ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "the situation seems different for n105a .",
    "fig.[mir ] ( top ) shows the 8@xmath1 m irac / spitzer image of n105a , dominated by hot dust and pah emission , with the positions of n105airs1 ( @xcite ; this work ) , water and oh maser @xcite and methanol maser @xcite indicated .",
    "although projection effects may affect our view , the morphology of n105a shows little evidence for massive star feedback ; no shell structure is seen in [ oiii ] images @xcite , in spite of the proximity of the ob association lh31 , identified near the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there seems to be no link between the water and oh maser source @xcite and the protostar location and any external trigger .",
    "however , the methanol maser to the south @xcite does appear to lie in a dense knot at the rim of a cavity in the molecular cloud .",
    "a massive young stellar object , n105airs1 , is already ionising the molecular cloud and also shows evidence of outflows .",
    "it seems likely that it is only a matter of time before n105airs1 starts sculpting the n105 complex , influencing current star formation occurring in the cloud core as signposted by the maser sources .",
    "the molecular cloud associated with n105a is a factor five denser than that in n113 @xcite .",
    "n105a is therefore more likely to collapse and fragment without the need for an external trigger .",
    "thus n105a seems to be at an earlier stage of its evolution , whereas n113 , n160a and in particular 30dor have seen more generations of stars forming prior to the current epoch of star formation .",
    "we have conducted a survey for water maser emission in 30doradus and a sample of hii regions in the large magellanic cloud , to investigate the conditions under which current star formation occurs .",
    "the locations of the maser sources are compared with infrared images from the eso / vlt ( at 3.8@xmath1 m ) and the spitzer space telescope , and an h@xmath3 image in the case of n113 .",
    "we also present 3@xmath04@xmath1 m spectroscopy to investigate the nature of two protostar candidates , in the n157b and n105a regions , showing evidence for the onset of the stellar feedback process in one of them .",
    "our water maser survey of 30dor uncovered one new source , 0539@xmath0691c , with a velocity consistent with the systemic velocity of the lmc .",
    "all detected water masers are located in the densest part of the nebula at the interface between neutral and ionised gas .",
    "n105airs1 shows strong h recombination line emission and its sed and ir colours are consistent with an embedded young massive star ionising its immediate surroundings .",
    "it also shows evidence for outflows .",
    "a nearby diffuse ir source , n105ablob , shows both h recombination and pah emission .",
    "we identify n157birs1 as an embedded protostar based on the analysis of its sed and a tentative detection of the 3.1@xmath1 m water ice feature .    in the well - developed hii regions 30dor , n113 and n160a ,",
    "no water masers have been detected deep within the molecular cloud complexes .",
    "they are always found at the interfaces between molecular cloud and hii region .",
    "this provides strong evidence that feedback from massive stars triggers subsequent star formation .",
    "although in the dense cloud n105a star formation seems to occur without evidence of massive star feedback , the general conditions in the lmc seem favourable for sequential star formation as a result of feedback .",
    "the wind speed and mass - loss rate of o and b stars decrease at lower metallicity ( mokiem & de koter , in preparation ) , thus massive star feedback could be weak in metal - poor environments but we see no evidence for this in the lmc ( metallicity @xmath240 per cent solar ) .",
    "this is important as the duration and intensity of star formation epochs in galaxies may depend on the efficiency of the local massive star feedback to trigger further star formation .",
