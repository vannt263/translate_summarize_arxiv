    "the population of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) provides an important sample of binary systems possessing homogeneous configurations of white dwarfs ( wds ) accreting from near main - sequence donor stars .",
    "a cv initially evolves towards shorter orbital periods , but near a period of @xmath5min bounces back towards longer periods with its donor star turning into a degenerate brown dwarf .",
    "recent cv searches , such as the significant harvest of cvs from sdss @xcite are finally unearthing large numbers of systems at short orbital periods as expected from binary evolution considerations .",
    "reliable estimates for binary parameters are needed to place individual systems on their evolutionary tracks .",
    "the faintness of the low mass donor stars in comparison to the wd and its accretion flow makes such parameter estimates difficult for short period systems ( e.g wz sge ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , except in favourable cases where eclipse constraints can be exploited @xcite .",
    "@xcite has identified an indirect method of inferring binary mass ratios using the tidally driven superhump modulations in the lightcurves of cvs . although promising , this furthermore highlights the need for suitable calibrator systems for which binary parameters can be accurately determined independently .",
    "gw lib is a short period dwarf nova ( @xmath6=76.78 mins ; @xcite ) displaying the typical characteristics of a cv near its period minimum .",
    "crucially , it was the first cv discovered to contain a pulsating wd @xcite , by analogy with field wd pulsators that lie in the instability strip for non - radial pulsations .",
    "so far , various methods to determine its system parameters have been exploited , including model fits to the wd absorption profiles , prominent in both the optical @xcite and the uv @xcite providing estimates for the wd @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "asteroseismological models , combined with a uv - flux limit , suggests a wd mass of @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "after its second recorded super - outburst in april 2007 @xcite , the superhump period suggest a mass ratio of @xmath10 @xcite when combined with patterson s empirical relation @xcite . in this letter we explore the possibilities of using the gravitational redshift of the mg  ii absorption line reported in @xcite in combination with mass - radius relations to give an independent measurement of the mass and spin of the wd in gw lib .",
    "gw  lib was observed within the 69.d-0591 program at the 8.4-m very large telescope ( vlt ) , located at the paranal observatory in chile as part of the european southern observatory , equipped with only the blue arm of the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves : @xcite ) .",
    "we retrieved a total of 45 science frames obtained during 2002 may 16 - 17 covering 2.4 and 2.8 binary orbits on the respective nights .",
    "the reduction of the raw frames was conducted using the most recent standard recipe pipeline release of the uves common pipeline library ( cpl ) recipes .",
    "the resultant optimally - extracted spectra covered a wavelength range of @xmath114020 - 5240  at a dispersion of 0.031  pixel@xmath3 and a spectral resolution of 0.10  ( 5.77  km  s@xmath3 ) as measured from the skylines .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated with one thorium argon arc per night .",
    "this calibration was tested against the two sky lines visible at @xmath115197.92 and @xmath115200.28 .",
    "the corresponding science frames were corrected for any remaining shifts .",
    "the residuals were scattered around zero with a maximum amplitude of @xmath12  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "next , heliocentric velocity corrections were applied to the individual frames to deliver spectra in a common heliocentric rest frame .",
    "no standard was observed in the correct settings on the nights and as no master response curve exists for the non - standard setup used , the frames were not flux calibrated .",
    "the exposure time was 500 seconds giving a signal to noise of @xmath136.5 per spectrum .",
    "details of the observations can be found in table [ tab : observations ] while figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows the average spectrum of gw  lib on the 16th of may .",
    "prominent features are the balmer disc emission lines on top of broad absorption troughs from the wd , visible due to the low mass accretion rate in the system .",
    "he  i is also seen in emission as is he  ii at 4685.75 .",
    "our pre - outburst , intermediate resolution spectra of gw lib showed mg  ii at 4481.21  in absorption ( see figure 2 , @xcite ) .",
    "the archival vlt / uves data confirm the presence of this line and thanks to the superior spectral resolution combined with the low inclination of the system shows it to be unblended from the nearby he  i emission at 4471 .",
    "we measure an ew of @xmath14  ( similar to @xmath15 in 2004 ) and a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath16 .",
    "in low accretion rate dwarf novae , the luminosity of the accretion disc is low enough to show the broad absorption features of the wd and can even show the narrow absorption features of metal lines due to freshly accreted gas .",
    "these lines open a window to probe the wd atmosphere directly and give independent measurements of stellar parameters . for lines formed near the primary",
    ", a gravitational red - shift is expected , introduced in the deep gravitational potential of the wd ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . a measurement of the gravitational redshift in the rest frame of the binary could provide the wd mass directly when combined with mass - radius models ( e.g. eggleton s relation as quoted in @xcite ) .",
    "this method has previously been used in cvs in the cases of u  gem @xcite , vw hyi @xcite and wz  sge @xcite .    in the case of gw lib",
    ", the directly measured redshift of the magnesium line ( @xmath17 ) needs to be rectified for several contributions in order to get the true gravitational redshift induced by the wd only ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "these corrections consist of the systemic velocity ( @xmath19 ) of the binary system and the effects of the gravitational potential from the donor star ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "hence the gravitational redshift due to the wd is given by :    @xmath21    we will discuss the various contributions and measurements independently .",
    "firstly , all 45 spectra of the two nights were individually continuum normalised and then binned into 20 equally spaced orbital phase bins to increase s / n .      to measure the redshift of the magnesium line to the best precision and minimise any orbital effect we compared several methods .",
    "firstly , we made a weighted orbital average and fitted the mg  ii absorption line with a weighted triple gaussian as the mg  ii is a triplet line .",
    "the different components have rest wavelengths of @xmath114481.126 with a transition probability of @xmath22 , @xmath114481.150 with @xmath23 and @xmath114481.325 with @xmath24 .",
    "the variables for the fit are the common offset ( for all 3 lines ) and the common fwhm to provide a good fit to the blue wing of the absorption feature .",
    "the peak height is also a common variable but scaled according to the various transition probabilities .",
    "this gives a best fit with a mean offset of @xmath25  km  s@xmath3 , a fwhm of @xmath26 and a common absorption line depth of @xmath27% .",
    "secondly , we fixed the fwhm and peak of the gaussians to these values and checked the individual spectra for orbital variablity .",
    "unfortunately , the s / n is too low to give good individual fits ( individual @xmath28 errors on the offset are @xmath29  km  s@xmath3 ) nor can we phase - lock this motion to the ephemeris of the system as determined in @xcite due to the uncertainty in the period .",
    "the resultant radial velocity curve suggested motion , and a formal sine fit delivered a semi - amplitude of @xmath30  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "to rectify for any orbital motion , we removed any measured shift compared to the mean from individual spectra .",
    "an uniform orbital average was constructed to minimise any effects caused by varying s / n over the orbital period and finally we refit this last average with our triple gaussian fit with as variables the common offset , the common fwhm and the weighted peak as described before ( see inset figure [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "this gives a final measurement of @xmath31  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the line has a fwhm @xmath32 .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of our measurement by following different recipes for combining and averaging the spectra but note that the uncertainty on the gravitational redshift is dominated by the s / n and resolution of the data and not the specific recipe used .",
    "the first correction is due to the influence of the gravitational potential of the donor on the magnesium line .",
    "however , the expected low mass of the donor star ( @xmath34 ) gives only a small correction of @xmath35  km  s@xmath3 near the wd surface , effectively negligible given the measurement uncertainty .      from simultaneous double gaussian fits",
    "to the double peaked h@xmath36 and h@xmath19 disc lines , combined with radial velocity curve fits provide a systemic velocity of @xmath37  km  s@xmath3 and a semi - amplitude of @xmath38  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "these values are consistent with previously derived values @xcite .",
    "as we measure @xmath19 from disc lines , we need to take into account that this emission is red - shifted both by the wd and the donor star .",
    "as @xmath39 is reciprocal to the distance , the amount we have to account for is minimal at the edge of the disc , @xmath40  m ( equation 2.61 of @xcite ) giving a minimal correction to @xmath39 of @xmath41  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "a more realistic value comes from the projected keplerian velocity at the edge of the disc @xmath42  km  s@xmath3 ( from the location of the disc ring in doppler maps and the estimate for @xmath43 , see @xcite ) which gives a kepler speed of @xmath44  km  s@xmath3 and corresponds to a @xmath45  km  s@xmath3 . including the transverse doppler redshift ( at half the strenght of the gravitational redshift ) this amounts to a total gravitational redshift at the location of the disc lines of @xmath46  km  s@xmath3 . the gravitational potential of the donor star has an effect of only @xmath47  km  s@xmath3 at a distance of @xmath48  m. hence the total @xmath49  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath19 from the disc lines combined with the above correction should be consistent with the @xmath19 suggested by the radial velocity curve from the donor star ( corrected for the effects of the gravitational potential at its surface ) . from the ca  ii emission line in the i - band we previously found @xmath50 @xcite ,",
    "the correction at the surface of the donor star is @xmath51  km  s@xmath3 from the donor star and @xmath52  km  s@xmath3 from the wd ( again including the transverse doppler shift ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "both estimates for @xmath19 are indeed consistent and with similar precision .",
    "hence we have used @xmath55 as it is derived from the same data set .      combining all values",
    "we find for the final gravitational redshift : @xmath56 when combined with theoretical and empirical models for the mass - radius relationship for wds this gives a direct measurement of the wd mass .",
    "the models we used are eggletons zero - temperature mass - radius relation as quoted by @xcite and several appropriate non - zero temperature models for gw lib from @xcite .",
    "we plot these models in figure [ fig : mass_radius_relation ] together with the @xmath57 line demanded by our measured @xmath39 . accommodating the intersections between non - zero temperature models we find that @xmath58 .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of superhump modulations in gw lib .",
    "combining this with the period from @xcite and the improved superhump excess - mass ratio relation given by @xcite , the implied mass ratio of the system is @xmath59 .",
    "we previously determined the projected radial velocity of the donor star , @xmath60 in @xcite .",
    "thus with an independent determination of @xmath61 from this paper , we can solve the system parameters for gw lib under these constraints and list these in table [ tab : systemparameters ] .",
    "if one assumes that the width of the mg  ii absorption line is dominated by rotational broadening , its fwhm can constrain the spin period of the wd .",
    "the fwhm of the absorption line fit is measured to be @xmath62 which corresponds to a @xmath63 of @xmath64  km  s@xmath3 at this wavelength .",
    "assuming @xmath43 is close to the value giving in table [ tab : systemparameters ] , this translates into a rotation speed of @xmath65  km  s@xmath3 at the surface of the wd . for a wd of mass @xmath66 and a radius for @xmath67  cm",
    "this results in a spin period of the wd of @xmath68  seconds .",
    "we have measured the gravitational redshift of the mg  ii absorption line in high - resolution echelle spectra of gw  lib during quiescence .",
    "assuming an origin in the photosphere of the accreting wd , we combined this redshift with non - zero temperature mass - radius relations for wds to derive a wd mass of @xmath69 . combining",
    "this independent measurement with other constrains confirms that gw  lib is a low mass ratio system observed at very low inclination ( table [ tab : systemparameters ] ) .",
    "because the mg  ii line was well - resolved in our data , we could also estimate the spin period of the wd to be @xmath68  seconds if we assume the width of the line to be dominated by rotational broadening .",
    "our mass value is significantly below the @xmath70 lower limit derived by @xcite .",
    "however , their choice of preferred solution was largely driven by the wd size as implied by the measured uv flux .",
    "@xcite fitted wd models to uv spectra of gw lib .",
    "two different single temperature solutions were explored ; @xmath71  pc ( @xmath72  km  s@xmath3 ) and @xmath73  pc ( @xmath74  km  s@xmath3 ) respectively .",
    "these solutions can be corrected to the latest parallax distance of @xmath75  pc ( thorstensen , private communication - improvement of the distance in @xcite ) . at this distance",
    ", the observed uv flux implies a radius of @xmath76  cm ( for a wd temperature of @xmath77  k ) .",
    "however , such a small radius intercepts the mass - radius relations at @xmath78 , figure [ fig : mass_radius_relation ] ( _ horizontal solid line _ ) and was indeed the reason @xcite ruled out their lower mass solutions .",
    "such a massive wd would result in @xmath79  km  s@xmath3 , much larger than our measured redshift would suggest .",
    "we note that @xcite fail to find a good single temperature fit and claim the best fit arises fitting a dual temperature model to the spectrum , allowing for a cooler zone that would place gw lib within the zz ceti instability strip for pulsating single wds .",
    "however , the uv - flux versus implied wd radius then becomes a less clear - cut argument given the freedom of two temperatures and the surface coverage split between the two .",
    "we note that the reverse has been seen in u  gem where the uv - flux places the wd at a lower mass than the gravitational redshift suggests @xcite . as @xcite warn ,",
    "no wd rotation was included in their asteroseismology models and therefore their derived parameters ( @xmath80 ) may need to be revisited given our estimate of the spin period of the wd in gw lib .",
    "a @xmath81  seconds should give rise to rotationally split modes .",
    "@xcite conducted a thorough campaign with a baseline of over 4 years to find these modes in the power spectrum of gw lib .",
    "the extensive search revealed a possible doublet around the 230s mode with a frequency difference between the components of @xmath82  @xmath83hz .",
    "if this doublet originates from the rotation splitting of an @xmath84 mode , the wd would have a spin period of @xmath85  days which is much longer than expected for the wd in a cv .",
    "approached from the other side , if a similar mode is split as a result of a rotation period of @xmath86  s , the frequency difference would be @xmath87  mhz and should be visible in the power spectrum .",
    "note that for the proposed spin period , the first order approximation for frequency splitting is no longer valid and the splitting would become asymmetric . from both gw  lib s and u  gem s comparison between wd mass found by gravitational redshift and the constraints from the uv - flux we can conclude that the measurement of the gravitational redshift through wd absorption lines gives in principle a good measurement of the wd mass in cvs , but is not always fully consistent with other constraints .",
    "nonetheless , it suggests photospheric absorption lines in the atmospheres of accreting wds can be a viable tool for mass measurements , in particular for low mass accretion rate cvs where the light from the wd dominates and especially for low @xmath43 systems .    for gw lib itself , we are still dependent on a number of assumptions in order to solve its system parameters . to properly align all methods , we need to revisit the mass from asteroseismology taking into account the effects of rotation and see if a wd model with a mass of @xmath88 at the latest distance can be fitted to the uv data with reasonable temperatures .",
    "to be able to calculate a direct mass ratio , a determination of @xmath89 from the mg  ii should be possible through high s / n phase - resolved spectroscopy . if furthermore matched with an solid ephemeris using the emission from the donor star ( giving @xmath60 and @xmath19 ) , a fully consistent and accurate wd mass for this prototypical accreting wd pulsator is entirely feasible .        , h. , dodorico , s. , kaufer , a. , delabre , b. , kotzlowski , h. , 2000 , in iye , m. , moorwood , a.  f. , eds . , society of photo - optical instrumentation engineers ( spie ) conference series , vol .",
