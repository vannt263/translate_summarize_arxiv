    "a _ partial chord diagram _ is a connected fatgraph ( i.e. , a graph equipped with a cyclic order on the half edges incident to each vertex ) comprised of an ordered set of @xmath0 disjoint real line segments ( called _ backbones _ ) connected with @xmath1 _ chords _ in the upper half plane with distinct endpoints , so that there are @xmath2 vertices of degree three ( or _ chord endpoints _ ) and @xmath3 vertices of degree two ( or _ marked points _ ) all belonging to the backbones ( in effect , ignoring the vertices of degree one arising from backbone endpoints . )",
    "if @xmath4 so there are no marked points , then we call the diagram a _ ( complete ) chord diagram_. each partial or complete chord diagram is a spine of an orientable surface with @xmath5 boundary components and therefore has a well - defined topological genus .",
    "the genus @xmath6 of a partial chord diagram on @xmath7 backbones and its number @xmath8 of boundary components are related by euler s formula @xmath9 .",
    "chord diagrams occur pervasively in mathematics , which further highlights the importance of the counting results obtained here . to mention a few ,",
    "see the theory of finite type invariants of knots and links @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) , the representation theory of lie algebras @xcite , the geometry of moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces @xcite and mapping class groups @xcite .",
    "moreover and as we shall further explain later , partial and complete chord diagrams each provide a useful model @xcite for the combinatorics of interacting rna molecules with the associated genus filtration of utility in enumerative problems @xcite and in folding algorithms on one @xcite and two backbones @xcite .",
    "our goal is to enumerate various classes of connected partial and complete chord diagrams , and to this end , we next introduce combinatorial parameters , where each enumerative problem turns out to be solved by an elegant partial differential equation on a suitable generating function in dual variables . in effect , creation and annihilation operators for the combinatorial data are given by multiplication and differentiation operators in the dual variables leading to algebraic differential equations .",

    "@xmath13 if its boundary contains @xmath14 connected components with @xmath15 marked points ; * _ boundary length spectrum _",
    "@xmath16 if the boundary cycles of the diagram consist of @xmath17 edge - paths of length @xmath12 , where the _ length _ of a boundary cycle is the number of chords it traverses counted with multiplicity ( as usual on the graph obtained from the diagram by collapsing each backbone to a distinct point ) _ plus _ the number of backbone undersides it traverses ( or in other words , the number of traversed backbone intervals obtained by removing all the chord endpoints from all the backbones ) .",
    "the data @xmath18 is called the _ type _ of a partial chord diagram ( cf . fig .",
    "[ cd_example ] ) .",
    "note that the entries in the data set @xmath18 are not independent .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath19 let @xmath20 denote the number of distinct connected partial chord diagrams of type @xmath21 taken to be zero if there are no chord diagrams of the specified type .",
    "our two basic models involve boundary point spectra of partial chord diagrams and boundary length spectra of complete chord diagrams , and each basic model , in turn , has both an orientable and a non - orientable incarnation .    .",

    "this can evidently be formalized in the language of planar projections of chord diagrams by two - coloring the chords depending upon whether they preserve or reverse the orientation of the plane of projection .    for partial chord diagrams and boundary point spectra",
    ", we shall count the subsets @xmath30 in the orientable case and @xmath31 in the non - orientable case .",
    "we can equivalently replace each backbone component containing @xmath11 vertices by a polygon with @xmath11 sides ( one of which is distinguished , corresponding to the first along the backbone ) .",
    "thus , the numbers @xmath32 count the orientable genus @xmath33 connected gluings of @xmath7 polygons , among which exactly @xmath11 have @xmath15 sides , with @xmath25 pairs of sides identified in such a way that the boundary of the glued surface has exactly @xmath14 connected components consisting of @xmath15 sides .",

    "however , our generating function ( [ that ] ) for these numbers and the partial differential equation ( [ fhatpde ] ) it satisfies are different from their counterparts in @xcite .",
    "the following observation we learned from m.  kazarian @xcite : for @xmath94 the generating functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 satisfy an infinite system of non - linear partial differential equations called the kp ( kadomtsev - petviashvili ) hierarchy ( in particular , this means that the numbers @xmath32 and @xmath97 additionally obey an infinite system of recursions ) .",
    "the kp hierarchy is one of the best studied completely integrable systems in mathematical physics .",
    "below are the several first equations of the hierarchy : @xmath98 where the subscript @xmath15 stands for the partial derivative with respect to @xmath99 .",
    "the exponential @xmath100 of any solution is called a _",
    "tau function _ of the hierarchy .",
    "the space of solutions ( or the space of tau functions ) has a nice geometric interpretation as an infinite - dimensional grassmannian ( called the _ sato grassmannian _ ) , see , e.  g. , @xcite or @xcite for details . see also @xcite for another application of the sato grassmannian to conformal field theory .",
    "the space of solutions is homogeneous : there is a lie algebra @xmath101 ( a central extension of @xmath102 ) that acts infinitesimally on the space of solutions , and the action of the corresponding lie group is transitive .    introduce the standard bosonic creation - annihilation operators @xmath103 and put @xmath104 ( the notation @xmath105 stands for the ordered product @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a permutation such that @xmath108 ) . is the famous cut - and - join operator @xcite used in the computation of hurwitz numbers . ]",
    "all the operators @xmath109 belong to the lie algebra @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that @xmath110 so that @xmath111 and @xmath112 also belong to @xmath101 .",
    "now we notice that the exponentials @xmath113 and @xmath114 of the initial conditions in theorems 1 and 2 both are kp tau functions for a trivial reason  their logarithms are linear in @xmath115 and therefore obviously satisfy the equations of kp hierarchy ( [ kp ] ) for any values of the other parameters .",
    "moreover , both @xmath116 and @xmath117 preserve the sato grassmannian and map kp tau functions to kp tau functions .",
    "thus , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are kp tau function as well , and we get    [ tau ] the generating functions @xmath120 satisfy the infinite system of kp equations ( [ kp ] ) with respect to @xmath115 for any values of the parameters @xmath121 .",
    "equivalently , the partition functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 are ( multi - parameter ) families of kp tau functions .",
    "let us now comment on the relevance of the above results to describing the rna interactions . define @xmath124 to be the number of complete and connected chord diagrams of genus @xmath6 on @xmath7 ordered and oriented backbones with @xmath25 chords , so in particular , @xmath125 is the harer - zagier number @xmath34 .",
    "these chord diagrams provide the basic model for a complex of interacting rna molecules , one rna molecule for each backbone and one chord for each watson - crick bond between nucleic acids , where one demands that the chord endpoints respect the natural ordering of the nucleic acids in each molecule , i.e , in each oriented backbone .",
    "it is very natural , as is the attention to connected chord diagrams in order to avoid separate molecular interactions . in reality ,",
    "rna folds according to a _ partial _ chord diagram , i.e. , there are in practice unbonded nucleic acids .",
    "recall from @xcite that a shape is a special connected and complete chord diagram which has no parallel chords , has a unique  rainbow \" on each backbone , i.e. , a chord whose endpoints are closer to the backbone endpoints than any other chord and no `` 1-chords '' connecting vertices consecutive in a single backbone unless the 1-chord is a rainbow . in the very special ( genus zero on one backbone ) case ,",
    "the single - chord diagram is permitted since the 1-chord is a rainbow , but in all other cases , there are no 1-chords , each backbone has a unique rainbow , and @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "if a shape is not the special single - chord diagram and we remove its @xmath7 rainbows , then the resulting diagram has @xmath128 .",
    "conversely , in a chord diagram with @xmath128 , no backbone has a rainbow , and @xmath7 rainbows can be added to produce a shape .",
    "let @xmath129 denote the number of shapes of genus @xmath6 on @xmath7 backbones with @xmath25 chords .",
    "define the generating functions @xmath130 , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , with @xmath133 it follows by construction that @xmath134 and @xmath135 , so we have computed here both the complete chord diagrams @xmath136 and the shapes @xmath129 for the matrix model in @xcite is given ( up to a constant depending only on @xmath6 times @xmath137 ) by our @xmath138 . ] .",
    "in fact @xcite , the generating functions for shapes and chord diagrams are algebraically related by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the catalan generating function , the former equation expressing the formal power series @xmath141 in terms of the polynomial @xmath142 .",
    "variables one point about shapes is that standard combinatorial techniques allow their `` inflation '' to complete chord diagrams as indicated in the previous formulas , and furthermore , complete chord diagrams can likewise be inflated to partial chord diagrams , cf .  @xcite .",
    "another point is that shape inflation is well - suited to the accepted ansatz for free energy and so provides efficient polynomial - time algorithms for computing minimum free energy rna folds @xcite at least in the planar case .",
    "a further geometric point @xcite is that shapes of genus @xmath6 on @xmath7 backbones are dual to cells in the harer - mumford - strebel @xcite or penner @xcite decomposition of riemann s moduli space of genus @xmath6 surfaces with @xmath7 boundary components provided @xmath143 .    as was already discussed , it is really partial chord diagrams that actually describe complexes of rna molecules with its distillation first to complete chord diagrams and then to shapes .",
    "all three formulations of the combinatorics have thus been treated here , namely , shapes and complete chord diagrams by the previous formulas and partial chord diagrams by inflation or instead directly with our generating function in theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains basic combinatorial results on the boundary point spectra of chord diagrams on one backbone and derives the equation given before on @xmath144 ( proposition [ 1b ] ) , and section 3 extends these results to include possibly separating edges and derives the equation given before on @xmath145 ( proposition [ mb ] ) .",
    "boundary point spectra of non - orientable surfaces are discussed in section 4 , and the equations given before on @xmath146 and @xmath147 are derived ( proposition [ nonor_thm ] ) , so together propositions [ 1b]-[nonor_thm ] comprise theorem 1 .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to boundary length spectra , and the situation is similar to boundary point spectra in that each counts data for each fatgraph boundary cycle .",
    "for this reason , the arguments are only sketched for boundary length spectra culminating in the equations from before on @xmath89 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "section 6 introduces a random matrix technique for partial chord diagrams and provides a matrix integral for boundary point spectra computations in both the orientable and non - orientable cases .",
    "free probability techniques permit the computation of the large - n limit which reproduces computations based on the partial differential equations , providing a consistency check on the entire discussion .",
    "as before , @xmath22 denotes the sequence @xmath151 with 1 in the @xmath15-th place and 0 elsewhere .",
    "we say simply that a diagram is of type @xmath152 if it is of type @xmath153 for some @xmath27 and let @xmath154 if there are no diagrams of type @xmath155 .",
    "[ rec_forv2 ] the numbers @xmath156 enumerating one backbone chord diagrams of type @xmath157 obey the following recursion relation : @xmath158 [ rec_for ]    let us start with a chord diagram of type @xmath157 .",
    "note that erasing a chord in a diagram , we keep its endpoints as marked points .",
    "this yields two possibilities .",
    "the first possibility is that the chord belongs to two distinct boundary components , say , one with @xmath159 and the other with @xmath160 marked points . after erasing the chord",
    ", these two boundary components join into one component with @xmath161 marked points , and the genus of the diagram does not change ( see fig .",

    "on the one hand , there are @xmath25 possibilities to mark a chord in a diagram with @xmath25 chords , so the number in question is @xmath171 . on the other hand , one can join any two marked points with a marked chord on any diagram with @xmath162 chords .",
