    "the dissociation behavior of molecules driven by bichromatic fields with commensurate frequencies has emerged as a rich research subject , especially for the control of molecular processes @xcite .",
    "the interplay of the two radiation fields opens up many new dissociation pathways , and it is well known that the relative phase between the two fields can affect these pathways drastically , so much so that the relative phase can be used as a means to control the outcome of the reaction @xcite . however , the mechanisms by which the relative phase controls the dissociation behavior are less well - known .",

    ", we report how the dissociation probability obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by direct numerical simulations can be understood qualitatively using a linear stability analysis of a small set of periodic orbits .",
    "our main result is that for most parameter values the principal features of the dissociation probability can be reproduced using two short periodic orbits ( with the period equal to the one of the fields ) , and in particular by the identification of the main bifurcations which have a drastic effect on the dissociation probability . in this way",
    ", our approach allows the qualitative prediction , with significant time savings , of the dynamics as parameters are varied .",
    "indeed , the typical time necessary for the computation of a periodic orbit and its stability is of the order of its period which is also the period of the field .",

    "the initial conditions from which the newton map are iterated is determined in two possible ways  : by a quick inspection of the poincar section ( which is easier if the periodic orbit is elliptic since it shows resonant islands around the periodic orbit considered ) or by continuation of periodic orbits for other values of parameters ( which is clearly the optimal way since periodic orbits usually deform continuously as parameters are varied , and even bifurcate ) .",
    "we also monitor the linear stability properties of these periodic orbits which are obtained by integrating the reduced tangent flow along the periodic orbit @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the two - dimensional hessian matrix ( composed of second derivatives of @xmath21 with respect to its canonical variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
