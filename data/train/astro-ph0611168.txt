    "several factors make dark matter made of sterile neutrinos with a mass in the kev range particularly interesting :    \\(i ) it is the lowest possible range of masses for fermionic dm . the pauli exclusion principle applied to the dm particles in the halos of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( such as draco or ursa minor ) implies a lower bound on the particle mass @xmath0  @xcite .",

    "such an extension ( dubbed @xmath2msm ) can quantitatively explain these `` beyond the standard model '' phenomena within a single consistent framework .",

    "it is important to cross - check these results using objects with masses determined by all methods , to minimize the systematic uncertainties inherent in each method .    in the present work",

    "[ fig : regions ] ) .",
    "this enables us to try to exclude the spatial regions with the highest thermal x - ray contamination ( and thus minimize the uncertainty of modeling this component , see  [ sec : uncertainties ] below ) , while at the same time retaining the densest dark matter regions .",
    "thus , we will use two regions in our x - ray analysis below , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] .",
    "the region peaks takes advantage of the separation between the dm and gas and combines two circles centered on the mass peaks , excluding the two x - ray brightness peaks .",
    "we will also use a subregion of peaks that includes only the bullet subcluster mass peak , sub , to illustrate the effects of uncertainties .",

    "we note that the mass near the cluster center derived from weak lensing is lower by a factor of about 2 compared to that derived by brada et al . , who combined weak and strong lensing data ( but whose fit is in fact dominated by the strong lensing data ) .",
    "some of this discrepancy is expected , because the weak lensing approximation breaks down near the peaks of massive clusters that produce strong gravitational arcs ( such as both subclusters of ) ; indeed , the peak densities in @xcite are insufficient to produce arcs .",
    "weak lensing is also insensitive to adding a constant mass sheet @xcite .",
    "strong lensing analysis may suffer from other types of uncertainties .",
    "the higher - mass @xcite map is limited to the central @xmath32 region , insufficient for our purposes , so we chose to use the @xcite mass map .",
    "this will result in conservative underestimates of the expected neutrino signal by a factor of up to 2 .",
    "we will illustrate this uncertainty in the final results .",
    "the gas mass within our spectral regions is estimated from a three - dimensional model fit to the _ chandra _  x - ray brightness and temperature maps .",
    "the x - ray emissivity of a hot gas ( @xmath33 kev ) in the _ chandra _  energy band is determined mostly by the gas density , and depends weakly on temperature .",
    "clusters are optically thin for x - rays , so in general , their gas density can be reconstructed very reliably for symmetric clusters . the apparent axial symmetry of  allowed us to derive a gas model with a 10% accuracy  @xcite .",

    "the acis non - grating energy resolution is between 12%4% ( half - power line width @xmath34 ) in the @xmath35 kev range .",
    "the x - ray spectra , the blank - sky background spectra , and acis responses ( that include all instrument effects such as mirror effective area , detector efficiency and energy resolution , to be applied to a model spectrum in order to compare it to the data ) were derived as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using the xspec package @xcite .",
    "the spectra for our three regions , sub , peaks , and whole , were well - fit ( with reduced @xmath36 in all cases ) with models consisting of one or several thermal plasma components ( apec , @xcite ) representing the multitemperature intracluster gas .",
    "a useful property of thermal spectra is that a continuous range of gas temperatures produces a spectrum that can be adequately fit with a sum of just several discrete temperatures .",
    "models for all regions were modified at low energies by the galactic absorption with @xmath37 .",
    "an example of the fit for the region sub is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sub - xspec ] ; this fit has a reduced @xmath38 for 152 d.o.f .",
    "none of the regions exhibits any emission lines other than those expected from hot gas ( mostly the @xmath39 kev fe line , redshifted to 5.2 kev ) .",
    "we use this fact to place constraints on the neutrino decay flux following the procedure previously used in this context by , e.g. , @xcite . in particular",
    ", for each energy bin in the 0.89 kev range , we added a narrow emission line ( a gaussian line much narrower than the detector spectral resolution ) to the thermal model , re - fit the spectra , and calculated a statistical upper limit on the line flux by increasing the line normalization until @xmath40 of the fit worsens by 9 ( @xmath41 or 99.7% confidence level ) . to obtain conservative upper limits",
    ", we allowed as much freedom for the parameters of thermal model as possible , including allowing the heavy element abundances ( that produce the thermal emission lines ) to vary , thus letting the neutrino line mimic some of the thermal line flux at the respective energies .",
    "we note that the full number of counts in each bin ( including the instrumental background ) is sufficiently high to ensure the gaussian statistics , and is much higher than the resulting limits on the line flux , so the use of @xmath42 is appropriate ( cf .",
    "an example of an emission line that would correspond to a @xmath41 upper limit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sub - xspec ] , and the resulting statistical limits , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes - regions ] .",
    "in addition to the statistical upper limits on the line flux , there are systematic uncertainties that has to be taken into account .",
    "first , the way how we normalize the acis background using the high - energy band @xcite results in a 3% uncertainty of the normalization at the useful energies . because the acis detector background has several prominent emission lines , such incorrect normalization may , for example , hide an emission line coming from the sky , or create a spurions line . to take this into account , we varied the background normalization by @xmath43 and repeated the fitting procedure . as expected",
    ", this leads to a noticeable increase of the allowed line flux only at rather high energies @xmath44 , where the background intensity increases steeply . for the region",
    "whole , limits with nominal background normalization and those of for normalization changed by @xmath45 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r6m - bg ] .",
    "these differences were added in quadrature to the statistical limits at each energy .",
    "there is a more insidious uncertainty arising from the inaccuracies of calibration of the detector response and gain ( the energy to spectral channel conversion ) . to assess this uncertainty ,",
    "we have extracted a spectrum from the 880 ks acis observation of the the very bright perseus cluster , and fit it using the same calibration products ( current as of summer 2006 ) and a model consisting of several thermal models as we use in this work , with all element abundances allowed to vary .",
    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : per ] . statistical errors in this dataset are mostly negligible .",
    "the fit shows systematic residuals at a 23% level of the model flux , some edge - like or even line - like , obviously caused by calibration inaccuracies ( e.g. , the feature around @xmath46 kev is obviously due to a gain error ) . to take this uncertainty into account",
    ", we added 3% of the thermal model flux contained within the width of a gaussian line , in quadrature to the statistical limits on the line flux .",
    "the result of adding these uncertainties for regions whole and sub is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r6m - cal ] .",
    "as expected , this uncertainty contributes mostly at lower energies , where thermal emission is bright ( at high energies , the increasing statistical uncertainty starts do dominate ) .",
    "this is the uncertainty that can be minimized by observing `` dark '' matter clumps , such as our gas - stripped subcluster .",
    "finally , the biggest uncertainty , unrelated to the x - ray data , comes from the factor of 2 difference between the cluster masses determined from the weak and strong gravitational lensing analyses @xcite",
    ". we will include it in the plot with results below ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results]_b _ ) .",
    "using eq .  ( [ eq:3 ] ) and masses from table  [ tab : masses ] ( and , of course , the assumption that sterile neutrinos account for all of the dark matter ) , we convert upper limits on the neutrino line flux for our two regions into restrictions on sterile neutrino in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] .",
    "the strongest constraint comes from the region whole  the bigger mass of dm within the field of view turns out to offer a greater advantage than the reduced thermal contamination at the gas - stripped dm peaks . for the sub and peaks regions , we plot constraints for the conservative ( perhaps excessively so ) dm mass estimate from weak gravitational lensing ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results]_a _ ) along with a stronger estimate for the higher strong lensing mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results]_b _ ) .",
    "although on average these results are about an order of magnitude weaker ( in terms of @xmath48 $ ] ) than other recent limits ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) plane ) should be very qualitative at @xmath49 kev .",
    "they must worsen as our limits do , since the xmm  effective area rapidly declines at the corresponding energies , similarly to _ chandra _ s . ] or more recent results  @xcite , they serve as an important cross - check .",
    "first , they are obtained from an object with @xmath50 , while previous results  @xcite were obtained for objects with @xmath11 . )",
    "is analyzed .",
    "that analysis strongly underestimated the effect of the cluster angular extent on energy resolution of the grating spectrum , so we do not consider it here .",
    "] furthermore , the dm mass was determined via gravitational lensing , a method not applicable for nearby objects .",
    "this is important , as different mass measurement methods are subject to different uncertainties , and using an object such as  makes the constraints more robust .      assuming that sterile neutrinos constitute all the dm and that they are produced in the early universe via mixing with active neutrinos only",
    ", one should expect a relation between the mass of sterile neutrino and its mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "combined with observational restrictions on the dm decay emission , this provides an upper bound on the sterile neutrino mass .",
    "however , as sterile neutrinos do not thermalize in the early universe , any such model relies on a number of assumptions ( including initial conditions at temperatures @xmath51  gev and the absence of entropy dilution )  @xcite . to define the boundary conditions , the knowledge of some `` beyond the @xmath2msm '' physics is needed . for example ,",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that all of the dm sterile neutrinos could have been produced by interaction with inflation .",
    "in such a scenario , the mixing angle can be arbitrarily small , even zero .",
    "this means that the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle are not necessarily related , contrary to the assumption used in recent literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "upper limits on the neutrino mass placed in those works , based on the upper limits on the decay line flux , are not only model - dependent , but depend strongly on the initial conditions . moreover , even assuming ad hock initial conditions implying that there was no dm at the temperatures @xmath52  gev ( which is hardly physically justified ) , the correct calculation of the production rate requires calculation of the non - preturbative qcd contributions , which is still a subject of discussion in the literature  @xcite .    nevertheless , for the sake of comparison with other works , the intersection of our constraints in fig .",
    "[ fig : results]_a _ with the @xmath53 relation obtained in  @xcite for the simplest dw model ( with one sterile neutrino , assuming zero initial conditions and a particular form of qcd contribution ) corresponds to an upper limit @xmath54 kev .",
