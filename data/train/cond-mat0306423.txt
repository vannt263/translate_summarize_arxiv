    "two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in quantizing magnetic fields is known to be a system with a rich phase structure . recently",
    ", much attention has been devoted to charge - density wave phases , which include stripe phase , bubble phase , and a wigner crystal  @xcite .",
    "an important new information on the dynamics of such phases was provided by a group of microwave experiments  @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the low - frequency ac response of magnetic - field - induced charge - density waves is strongly affected by disorder , in ways not anticipated in prior theoretical work on the subject .",
    "motivated by these intriguing results , huse and the present author  @xcite reconsidered the problem of collective dynamics of a wigner crystal pinned by quenched disorder . here",
    "i give a brief account of this work and its more recent extensions .",
    "much of the foregoing discussion also applies to the bubble phase .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to a brief introduction to the charge - density wave phases , conventional expectations regarding the response of a pinned system , and how they compare with the observed behavior .",
    "sections  [ sec : model ] and [ sec : analysis ] outline our theoretical model and its analysis . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] contains comparison of our theory with the experiment and concluding remarks .",
    "the bubble phase  @xcite can be viewed as a crystal made of multi - electron droplets ( bubbles ) .",
    "the number of particles per bubble @xmath0 depends on the landau level filling fraction @xmath1 and changes in discrete steps at certain critical values of @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath0 counts only the quasiparticles of the topmost ( @xmath2th ) landau level , which is partially filled .",
    "the other landau levels are completely filled and in a first approximation , provide an inert background of constant uniform density .",
    "bubble phases with @xmath3 appear when three or more landau levels are populated , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the wigner crystal is the @xmath6 bubble phase ( one particle per unit cell ) .",
    "it forms at any landau level @xmath2 provided @xmath1 is close enough to an integer .",
    "we refer to the bubble and the wigner crystal phases jointly as electron crystals . at zero temperature , in the absence of disorder and commensurability effects",
    "such crystals have a perfect triangular lattice and a long - range order .",
    "they possess collective modes referred to as magnetophonons .",
    "wigner crystal has a single magnetophonon branch  @xcite , bubble phases may have several  @xcite ; however , in both cases only one mode is gapless .",
    "the following discussion is devoted exclusively to the dynamics of the gapless mode .",
    "quasiclassically , a magnetophonon excitation can be understood as a coherent precession of @xmath0-electron bubbles around their equilibrium positions , with the charge distribution ( form - factor ) of individual bubbles being fixed . in this picture",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom are the centers of mass of the bubbles .",
    "the effects of disorder on gapless magnetophonon excitations belong to a broad class of phenomena known as _ pinning_. the pinning affects a variety of physical systems .",
    "it has been extensively studied in the context of conventional charge - density waves  @xcite and vortex lattices in superconductors  @xcite .",
    "two pinning mechanisms are distinguished , the individual and the collective ones .",
    "in this paper we focus on the latter .",
    "the collective pinning is the regime where the random potential due to impurities and other defects is too weak to significantly deform the crystalline lattice , so that the crystal is well ordered at small length scales .",
    "however , the cumulative effect of the disorder eventually dominates the crystal elasticity at a pinning length , which is much larger than the lattice constant @xmath7 .",
    "the long - range order of the crystal is thereby destroyed .",
    "similarly , the low - frequency collective modes are unaffected by disorder at the scale of @xmath7 , but get localized at some larger scale .",
    "these localized modes give rise to a maximum at a disorder - dependent frequency @xmath8 in the real part of diagonal conductivity @xmath9 . such maxima",
    "( pinning modes ) have been studied primarily in conventional charge - density wave materials  @xcite . however , a few observations of similar absorption lines due to 2deg subject to a strong magnetic field have also been reported  @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned latest experiments on high - mobility 2deg provided much more extensive and higher resolution data in the strong - field regime  @xcite and also detected pinning resonances in weak fields  @xcite , which were interpreted as signatures of bubble phases and wigner crystals at higher landau levels .",
    "the quantities that can be extracted and analyzed most reliably are ( i ) the position @xmath8 of the peak in @xmath10 , ( ii ) its width @xmath11 , and ( iii ) the area @xmath12 under the curve ( see fig .",

    "[ fig_bowl ] .",
    "each localized magnetophonon mode is visualized as precession ( or drift ) of a crystallite with linear dimension of the order of the pinning length @xmath13 in a potential well created by disorder .",
    "let @xmath14 be the cyclotron frequency in the external magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "for a potential well with curvature @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total mass of the patch , an elementary calculation gives the frequency of the drift motion @xmath18 in the experimentally relevant case @xmath19 .",

    "\\(ii ) as far as @xmath11 is concerned , in a random system of independent oscillators we expect a broad distribution of @xmath22  @xcite , which implies a broad spectrum of their eigenfrequencies , i.e. , @xmath23 .",

    "quality factors @xmath28 as large as ten were reported in the published literature on the high - field wigner crystal  @xcite and lower but still respectable quality factors @xmath29 for the bubbles .",
    "only the integrated oscillator strength @xmath12 is in a rough agreement  @xcite with the simple theory .",
    "it turns out that the anomalous @xmath15-dependence can in principle be explained by the interplay between the correlation length of the pinning potential and the @xmath15-dependent form - factor of the electron wavefunctions  @xcite . on the other hand , to explain the small linewidth one has to develop a theory that goes beyond the cartoon depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_bowl ] .",
    "such a theory is the subject of this paper .",

    "up to logarithmic factors  @xcite , @xmath68 , and so @xmath69 .",

    "the lineshape and linewidth require much more elaborate analysis given in the next section .",
    "to find @xmath70 and @xmath71 we have to resort to certain approximations , which we motivate by physical arguments . as a starting point , consider a simpler model of a pinned one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron crystal with short - range ( screened ) interaction @xmath35 in the absence of any magnetic field .",
    "it has been known from early work  @xcite that @xmath72 has a broad maximum at the characteristic pinning frequency @xmath73 , where @xmath13 is the pinning length and @xmath74 is the sound velocity .",

    "recently , the present author  @xcite and later also gurarie and chalker  @xcite advanced analytical and numerical arguments that @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "the physical picture is as follows  @xcite . in 1d , elastic displacement @xmath77 is a scalar and there is a formal analogy between the phonon problem and 1d localization in a random potential @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , the phonon mode with `` energy '' @xmath79 must satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath80 . borrowing standard arguments from the 1d localization literature , one can show that phonon eigenmodes with @xmath81 have localization length @xmath82 .",
    "each mode can be viewed as harmonic oscillations of a segment of length @xmath13 in a potential well created by the pinning centers .",
    "this echoes the picture depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_bowl ] and arguments given in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "the @xmath83-law for the the low - frequency ( `` soft '' ) modes follows from a careful derivation of the the statistical distribution of the curvatures of such collective potential wells .",
    "one finds  @xcite that the density of states @xmath84 of the eigenmodes goes as @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the conductivity is proportional to @xmath1 , and once the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath87 to @xmath65 is taken into account , one obtains @xmath88 .",
    "what is important here is that the derivation of @xmath1 and the exponent @xmath89 is rather insensitive to microscopic details . therefore , @xmath83-law is expected to hold in higher dimensions and for other types of pinning models  @xcite .",
    "shortly below , we will make use of this universality .",
    "let us now return to the 2d case but first examine a model , which is a truncated version of the original one .",
    "consider what happens if we remove by hand all elements of the dynamical matrix @xmath90 that connect l and t modes .",
    "( on some crude level , it corresponds to a 2d crystal in zero magnetic field . ) as in 1d case , we reduce the problem to solving a schrdinger equation .",
    "now we have two such equations , @xmath91 for t - modes and @xmath92 for l - modes . here",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 are the t - t and l - l components of the matrix @xmath95 , and @xmath51 should be inderstood as integral operator .",
    "what is the structure of the resultant eigenmodes ?",
    "the t - modes with @xmath96 again form a set of oscillators localized on the scale of the pinning length @xmath13 ( @xmath20 , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , can be thought of as the @xmath97 pinning frequency ) .",
    "the soft t - modes correspond to @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 . turning to the l - modes , in principle",
    ", we also obtain a set of local oscillators .",
    "if @xmath51 could be replaced by some @xmath50-independent constant much larger than @xmath56 , as in the case of coulomb interaction screened by a nearby metallic gate , then the localization length of l - modes would be @xmath100 .",
    "it is much larger than @xmath13 because @xmath94 has about the same rms fluctuations as @xmath93 yet the l - modes are much stiffer and resist localization effects more efficiently . if @xmath50-dispersion of @xmath51 is taken into account , then one finds  @xcite that the eventual localization does occur , but at a scale so large that it can be treated as infinite for all practical purposes . in this approximation ,",
    "randomness in @xmath94 does not affect the dynamics , so that @xmath94 can be replaced by @xmath53 .",
    "we arrived at a system of localized t - phonons and delocalized l - phonons .",
    "in such a system , @xmath101 has an infinitely sharp pinning mode .",
    "let us now reinstate the l - t mixing .",
    "we will show that localization does occur at some reasonable scale @xmath102 in this case and that @xmath11 is finite albeit much smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "however , this is not a trivial task because the dynamical equations become much more complicated .",
    "fortunately , in the large-@xmath15 limit there are two simplifications .",
    "first , we only need to consider mixing due to the lorentz force .",
    "( the l - t mixing due to disorder is not important for the main results . )",
    "second , the inertial terms @xmath103 in @xmath44 [ eq .  ( [ d_0 ] ) ] can be neglected .",

    "( [ u_l_equation_i ] ) can be written in terms of localized t eigenmodes discussed above .",
    "we will see that @xmath107 ; therefore , it is legitimate to coarse - grain the model on the scale @xmath13 , so that each localized oscillator becomes represented by a single site .",
    "this leads to the equation @xmath108 in the real space , it reads @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the inverse fourier transform of @xmath111 $ ] .",

    "the spectrum of eigenmodes can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ u_l_equation_iii ] ) by setting @xmath117 and solving the resultant system of linear equations .",
    "for example , if we neglect randomness and replace @xmath118 s by their typical value @xmath119 , we obtain @xmath120 , and so @xmath121 in agreement with sec .",

    "the net effect of this term is to shift @xmath87 by a random amount of the order of @xmath133 .",
