    "ultracold fermi gases of alkali atoms such as @xmath0k or @xmath1li in harmonic traps are quantum systems that are experimentally accessible by the techniques of atom trapping and cooling @xcite .",
    "the high purity and the low temperature of the samples and the high resolution of the detection techniques make these systems ideal candidates for the study on the mesoscopic scale of single - level quantum properties such as shell structures in the particle density profiles @xcite . in the experiments",
    "the trapped atomic gas can be fully spin - polarized and the strength and the anisotropy of the trap can be tuned to reach quasi - onedimensional ( 1d ) or quasi - twodimensional ( 2d ) configurations .",
    "quantum effects in the equilibrium profiles can be greatly enhanced by varying the anisotropy of the confinement @xcite . here",
    "we show how to enhance quantum effects on 2d equilibrium density profiles by putting the gas into rotation .    in a wholly different physical realm electrons in a quantum dot",
    "realize a fermi gas moving in a plane under the effect of a harmonic potential .",
    "a quantum dot is often described as an artificial atom , in which a confinement potential replaces the attractive potential of the nucleus and the increased length scale allows access to experiments that are not practicable on real atoms @xcite .",
    "spin effects are also accessible and complete spin polarization is easily achieved in a small dot .",
    "confinement by a circularly symmetric harmonic potential is of special interest , since in this case the energy needed to add electrons to the dot reveals a shell structure @xcite .",
    "the effects of a magnetic field on the electronic properties of circular quantum dots have been studied by numerical diagonalization and by spin - density functional methods ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these approaches have also been applied to rectangular dot structures , when the effective lateral confinement is described as elliptical . in such a confinement",
    "the single - particle energy levels as well as the energy spectra for two - electron systems are exactly known as functions of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a fermi gas of spin - polarized charged particles in a uniform magnetic field , under conditions such that the coulomb interactions can be neglected as specified below , can be mapped into a rotating fermi gas of neutral atomic particles in a state of complete spin polarization , where the atom - atom interactions are negligible on account of the pauli principle suppressing @xmath2-wave scattering . in this work",
    "we examine the particle density profiles of the ideal system that we have just introduced . for definiteness we shall refer throughout the paper to the ideal 2d fermi gas of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field , although some parts of the discussion ( and in particular the analysis of the elastic light scattering spectrum given in sec . [ seclight ] )",
    "are specifically aimed at an atomic fermi gas in uniform rotation .",
    "an ideal 2d fermi gas of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field has recently been studied by van zyl and hutchinson @xcite , who have used an inverse laplace transform method and an expansion in laguerre polynomials to calculate its thermodynamic properties .",
    "their method can be implemented exactly in the case of a uniform gas , whereas recourse to a local - density approximation is needed for an inhomogeneous gas on account of the broken symmetry induced by the concurrent effects of the harmonic confinement and of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the single - particle hamiltonian of the ideal gas can be diagonalized on the basis of left and right circular or elliptical quanta , bringing it to the form of the hamiltonian of two independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "the eigenfunctions can thus be written in terms of hermite polynomials , as we do in this work .",
    "practical applications of our approach are limited to ultracold fermi gases consisting of a restricted number of particles , so that the number of hermite polynomials that need explicit numerical calculation remains limited .",
    "we shall give below numerical illustrations for systems of 10 and 106 fermions at zero temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we set out the single - particle hamiltonian of the system in a generic gauge which allows its diagonalization on the basis of left and right - handed circular or elliptical quanta . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we express the spatial density profile of the gas in terms of hermite polynomials and display several configurations for various values of the strength of the magnetic field and of the anisotropy parameters of the confinement .",
    "we show that an impressive shell structure arises in the profile whenever there is an excess of density of states with zero angular momentum . in sec .",
    "[ seclight ] we calculate the elastic contribution to the static structure factor of the gas , in order to show how the shell structure is reflected in the elastic light scattering spectrum . finally sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] offers some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a 2d spin - polarized fermi gas at zero temperature , made up of @xmath3 non - interacting fermions of charge @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 subject to a uniform magnetic field @xmath6 perpendicular to the plane of confinement ( the @xmath7 plane , say ) .",
    "the gas is immersed in a uniformly charged background medium so that the total system is neutral .",
    "screening effects cut the range of the coulomb interactions and to a first approximation these can be neglected on account of the pauli principle keeping fermions with parallel spins far apart from each other .",
    "more generally , the coulomb interactions between electrons in a quantum dot are negligible when the harmonic oscillator length characterizing the confinement is small compared with the effective bohr radius .    as already noted in sec .",
    "i , this system can be mapped into a spin - polarized gas of @xmath3 neutral fermions confined in a rotating trap .",
    "the map is guaranteed by a correspondence between the maxwell equations and the navier - stokes equations in the absence of viscosity , as demonstrated by marmanis @xcite . in the rotating system",
    "the velocity field @xmath8 of the fermions and the vorticity @xmath9 play the role of the vector potential @xmath10 and of the magnetic field @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "it is useful to present first the case of an isotropic harmonic potential .",

    "of course , the fermi energy is determined by the number of fermions in the trap .",

    "[ fig2 ] reports the corresponding density of occupied states ( dos ) . in zero field",

    "fig1](b ) and [ fig2](b ) ) there still is an excess population of the state @xmath71 and a central peak in the density profile . at still higher fields ( figs .",
    "[ fig1](c ) and [ fig2](c ) ) the dos becomes constant and the occupation of two states with opposite angular momentum ( @xmath72 ) produces a central hole in the density profile . finally , at very large fields ( figs .",
    "[ fig1](d ) and [ fig2](d ) ) the landau quantization limit is being recovered , with a filling factor equal to unity in a dos which is constant for @xmath73 .",
    "this is spatially the most compact distribution of the droplet of spin - polarized fermions , which is commonly denoted as mdd @xcite .",
    "similar density distributions can be obtained for higher numbers of fermions . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we report as an example the spatial distribution of 106 fermions at @xmath74 , showing as in fig .",

    "the filling factor becomes unity and the density profile takes a mdd configuration similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .    in an anisotropic trap the overall elliptical shape of the fermion cloud can still sustain a shell structure , which becomes progressively smoothen as the field is increased . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the case of 10 fermions in a trap with anisotropy parameter @xmath77 . for @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) the dos is similar to that shown for a circular trap in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , but the value of @xmath79 is not related to the angular momentum in the anisotropic trap and a central peak in the density profile is consequently missing . instead , raising the field produces a softening of the oscillations of the profile along the _ x _ axis and some enhancement of those along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at @xmath80 ( fig . [ fig4](c ) ) , where a central hole in the profile is accompanied by two bumps along the _ y _ axis . for this value of @xmath81",

    "the angular distribution of the scattered light can be decomposed into two components : an elastic term originating from diffraction by a finite object of given optical density profile , and an inelastic term determined by excitations in the quantum fluid .",
    "only the elastic term remains if the light frequency is far - off - resonance from the internal states of the fluid .",
    "this term is determined by the elastic static structure factor @xmath89 , which is defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the wave vector transfer in the scattering process .",

    "in summary , we have evaluated the particle density profiles of an ideal gas of spin - polarized fermions confined in 2d inside a circular or elliptical harmonic trap as functions of an applied magnetic field or of the trap rotational frequency .",
    "we have introduced a generic @xmath44-gauge in which the eigenstates of the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of right - handed and left - handed elliptical quanta and written in terms of hermite polynomials .",
