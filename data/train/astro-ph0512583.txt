    "the 110 mpc filament mapped out by 37 ly@xmath3-emitting objects around the @xmath0 = 2.38 galaxy cluster j2143 - 4423 is the largest known structure above @xmath1 @xcite , comparable in size to some of the largest structures seen in the local universe ( i.e. the great wall , * ? ? ?",
    "initially identified from narrow - band imaging tuned to  at @xmath0=2.38 , it has since been spectroscopically confirmed @xcite .",
    "in addition to its compact -emitters , this high - redshift `` filament '' is also home to four extended -emitting clouds , known more commonly as lyman @xmath3 blobs .",
    "the ly@xmath3 blob is a relatively new class of objects found among high - redshift galaxy over - densities @xcite . while similar in extent ( @xmath4100 kpc ) and flux ( 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 ) to high - redshift radio galaxies , blobs are radio quiet and are therefore unlikely to arise from interaction with jets .",
    "current surveys have reported the discovery of roughly 10 of these giant blobs , but they are not isolated high redshift oddities . @xcite have demonstrated that the blobs are part of a continuous size distribution of resolved ( @xmath216 arcsec@xmath7 ) emitters , with more than 40 presently known .",
    "one of the standing mysteries of the blobs is the source of their energy , as the measured ultraviolet flux from nearby galaxies is insufficient to produce the observed fluxes .",
    "one possibility is that the blobs are powered by supernova - driven superwinds @xcite , driving great plumes of gas into the surrounding ambient medium and producing shocks .",
    "an obscured agn is another model , with the exciting ultraviolet illumination escaping along different lines of sight ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "cooling flows have also been suggested @xcite as a possible power source .",
    "there is growing evidence that blobs mark regions of extreme infrared luminosity .",
    "submillimeter flux has been detected in two of the giant blobs , smm j221726 + 0013 @xcite and smm j17142 + 5016 @xcite .",
    "the submm source smm j02399 - 0136 is also likely surrounded by a blob halo , as its emission covered most of a 15@xmath8 slit @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite has detected submm flux from four of the smaller ( @xmath9 55 square arcsec ) and less luminous ( @xmath9 2@xmath1010@xmath11 l@xmath12 ) blobs from @xcite : lab5 , lab10 , lab14 & lab18 .",
    "also , @xcite has discovered a single blob ( sst24 j1434110 + 331733 ) in the noao deep wide - field survey with strong 24  flux ( 0.86 mjy ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the _ spitzer _ 24  observations of these @xmath0=2.38 -emitters , both compact sources and blobs .",
    "we estimate the total far - infrared luminosity for all detections and discuss the possibility of a connection between mergers and blobs .",
    "we assume an @xmath13=0.3 , @xmath14=0.7 universe with h@xmath15=70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "our data were obtained using multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) in 24  photometry mode . the field was observed on october 13 and 14 and november 4 and 5 , 2004 .",
    "the primary observation was a 3@xmath105 raster map , covering approximately 15@xmath1025 arcminutes of the filament structure , centered at 21@xmath1642@xmath1738.0@xmath18 , -44@xmath1926@xmath2030@xmath8 .",
    "the total integration time per pixel is 1818 seconds .",
    "in addition we observed one small side field ( 5@xmath105 arcmin ) with a single known -emitter ( at 21@xmath1642@xmath1756.3@xmath18 , -44@xmath1937@xmath2057@xmath8 ) for 666 seconds .",
    "the data were initially reduced by the standard _ spitzer _ pipeline .",
    "we then produced sky frames for each data frame from the median of the 100 nearest ( in time ) data frames .",
    "we assembled the final mosaic of the mips 24  image using the mopex package available from the _ spitzer _ science center .",
    "the final drizzled pixel scale is 1.23@xmath8 per pixel .",
    "for source extraction , we applied the apex source extraction package available within mopex .",
    "apex requires an input point response function ( prf ) , which we created from the 40 brightest objects extracted from the final image .",
    "our final apex source extraction detected 3010 objects down to roughly 50 @xmath21jy .",
    "the full dataset will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "the 5-@xmath22 detection limit , as measured within a 7.5@xmath8 aperture , is 58 @xmath21jy over most of the image , but can be as high as 180 @xmath21jy at the edges . none of the -emitters for which apex failed to find mips sources had aperture fluxes greater than these 3-@xmath22 upper limits .",
    "a list of all extracted mips sources associated with -emitters is presented in table 1 .",
    "a brief note on the naming conventions : the first three -emitters were found by @xcite and named b1 , b2 , & b3 .",
    "further study by @xcite demonstrated that the b3 source was not real , but they also found another source , which they labeled b4 .",
    "@xcite found 34 additional -emitters in the field and so , rather than label each one , only gave b # designations to the three new blobs : b5 , b6 , & b7 .",
    "we continue the b # naming convention , adding sources b8 and b9 .",
    "six out of 22 ( @xmath430% ) of the ly@xmath3-emitters within the filament are associated with mips 24  sources ( figure 1 ) , including three of the four resolved ( @xmath250 kpc ) ly@xmath3 blobs .",
    "this blob association rate is much higher than that for unresolved ly@xmath3-emitters ( only 3 of 18 ) .",
    "we determined a mips source to be associated if it lies within one mips fwhm ( 5.9@xmath8 ) of the position of the ly@xmath3-emitter . in four cases",
    "the coordinates for the mips and  sources agree to less than an arcsecond , while the remaining two are separated by 2.7 ( blob b7 ) and 4.1@xmath8 ( source b9 ) .",
    "we checked the mips field astrometry against that of the optical data by comparing object centroids for all detected mips sources against those found in i - band .",
    "after correction for a 0.3@xmath8 offset , we found that the positions of the objects agree with a standard deviation of 1.5@xmath8 .",
    "the density of mips sources in the central portion of the field is 4.5 arcmin@xmath23 , making the odds of a chance superposition of a random mips source @xmath90.4% for those within an arcsecond , @xmath9 2.9% for within 2.7@xmath8 , and @xmath9 6.6% for within 4.1@xmath8 .",
    "however , all the detected ly@xmath3-emitter counterparts have fluxes greater than 120 @xmath21jy , well above the detection limits and with a consequently lower surface density .",
    "accounting for source brightness decreases the probability of chance superposition below 0.3% for all sources except for source b9 , which has a 3.3% chance that its associated mips source ( 4.1@xmath8 away ) is mere coincidence . for comparison ,",
    "the @xcite mips source lies 2.5@xmath8 from the center of its associated blob .",
    "we do not detect 16 of the 22 ly@xmath3-emitters in the mips image .",
    "six of these sources lie in regions of higher noise , where the 5@xmath22 detection limits range from 100 - 180 @xmath21jy .",
    "the remaining ten ly@xmath3-emitters are in the central regions of the image , with detection limits of @xmath960 @xmath21jy .",
    "the lack of faint mips counterparts is unlikely to be a result of error in object positions , as we examine a radius nearly 4 times the typical 1@xmath22 offset found from matching the mips and optical data .",
    "the absence of detections between 60 and 120 @xmath21jy indicates there is not a rapid climb in numbers with decreasing 24  flux for ly@xmath3-emitters over this range , although the number of objects considered is small .",
    "two of the ly@xmath3 blobs , b6 and b7 , appear to have additional mips sources associated with them .",
    "the b6 ly@xmath3 blob extends over 25@xmath8 , or over 200 kpc at @xmath0=2.38 , and contains more than one knot or concentration .",
    "the brightest ly@xmath3 knot is the central one and it is associated with a bright mips source , but the southern knot ( not to be confused with the large diffuse area to the southeast ) also has a mips source of almost identical brightness .",
    "there is also an area of more diffuse ly@xmath3 emission to the north which also appears to be associated with a bright mips source .",
    "each source is separted by approximately 9.5@xmath8 from the central source , creating a potential triple system .",
    "the northern source should probably be treated with some caution , as it not only lacks any clear ly@xmath3 concentration , but there is also a relatively bright galaxy visible at that location in the b - band image ( b=22.5 ) , which is unlikely to be at high redshift .",
    "the center of the b7 ly@xmath3 blob actually lies between two sources .",
    "we have associated it with the brighter , closer mips source 2.7@xmath8 ( 20 kpc ) to its southeast , but a second source lies 5.9@xmath8 ( 45 kpc ) to the northwest . while there is a 10% chance the second object could be chance association , the location of the ly@xmath3 blob immediately between the two mips sources suggests a possible physical connection .",
    "the detected 24  flux densities range from 0.1 to 0.6 mjy , which at @xmath0=2.38 corresponds to roughly 2@xmath24 to 10@xmath25 l@xmath26 in rest frame 7  @xmath27 . to convert from the mid - infrared to total bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath28 )",
    ", we use the relationship from @xcite , hereafter ce01 , calibrated by examining galaxies measured with both iso and iras :    @xmath29    in an effort to avoid over - estimation of l@xmath30 , the mid - infrared conversion used throughout this paper assumes the low end of the 1@xmath22 envelope , producing total luminosities roughly a factor of 2 lower than a direct application of the formula .",
    "even this conservative mid - ir conversion puts all the sources in the class of ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath31 ) , with many achieving hyper - lirg ( @xmath32 ) status ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the ce01 relation is based on nearby starburst - dominated galaxies and it is possible it may not hold at high redshift or for the most extreme starbursts , if their spectral energy distributions are significantly different .",
    "the l@xmath28 of most ulirgs in the nearby universe comes from a combination of strong star formation and agn activity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review ) .",
    "the majority are dominated by the stellar component , seen both in the far - infrared to radio relation @xcite and their strong pah to continuum ratios @xcite . however , this changes as the luminosity approaches that of the hyper - lirg ( lir@xmath210@xmath33 l@xmath12 ) ; agns typically dominate above 10@xmath34 l@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is presently unknown how this trend will continue out to higher redshifts , where high - mass mergers , like those predicted to build giant ellipticals , could be producing energies on the scale of a hyper - lirg through star formation @xcite .",
    "pahs are already being found in high - redshift infrared sources @xcite .",
    "if these mips sources are agn - dominated , one would expect @xmath35 , which would still place all the detected sources in the class of ulirgs .",
    "if we combine the 24  detections from this study and from @xcite with the submm detections of blobs @xcite , there are now at least 10 known high redshift ulirgs surrounded by halos .",
    "we plot luminosity versus l@xmath28 for all the identified blobs with infrared or submm detections in figure 3 .",
    "smm j02399 - 0136 @xcite is excluded as its total flux is not precisely known .",
    "we use the published l@xmath28 values for all submm sources , but derive the total l@xmath28 for the @xcite 24  source using the ce01 relation to better compare with our results .    applying a similar analysis",
    ", @xcite found a weak /ir relation for submm - detected blobs with a typical l@xmath36/l@xmath28 ratio just under 0.1% . including our 24-detected blobs , which are brighter in than most of the @xcite objects , we continue to see the same weak trend , with a l@xmath36/l@xmath28 efficiency of 0.05 - 0.2% .",
    "neither the detection of x - rays ( smm j17142 + 5016 & lab18 ) nor civ emission ( b1 , smm j17142 + 5016 , & sst24 j1434110 + 331733 ) , both strong indicators of agn activity , has any clear effect on this trend .",
    "there is one significant outlier , the b5 blob , which falls at least a factor of 30 away from this proposed relation .",
    "while this relation is still tentative , it suggests a direct causal connection between the ulirg infrared luminosity and the blobs .",

    "the high rate of mips detection for the blobs ( 3 out of 4 ) demonstrates that these ultraviolet sources are locations of tremendous infrared energy .",
    "two of the blobs ( b6 & b7 ) are associated with multiple mips sources , suggesting possible interaction or even merger .",
    "these separations between possible ulirg component galaxies are large ( 60 - 70 kpc ) compared to the typical low - redshift ulirg , which have a median separation 2 kpc @xcite . however , interacting ulirgs with wide separations on the scale of 50 kpc do exist @xcite , and seem to occur when at least one the interacting galaxies is highly gas - rich @xcite .",
    "previous high resolution _",
    "hst _ imaging also indicates a possible blob connection to merging galaxies .",
    "for instance , nicmos imaging of blob b1 shows a pair of compact , red galaxies with a projected separation of less than 7 kpc @xcite .",
    "only three other blobs have been imaged with _",
    "hst _ : the blobs in the field of 53w002 , one of which shows a second nearby galaxy @xcite , and blob ssa22a - c11 @xcite which stis imaging shows to be composed of several likely interacting components @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find multiple components within their blob , visible in their ground - based , optical imaging .    in the local universe ,",
    "the most energetic mergers are associated with the ulirgs , with roughly 90% of ulirgs clearly interacting @xcite .",
    "the majority of local ulirg mergers are between two low mass ( 0.3 - 0.5 l@xmath37 ) galaxies @xcite , but major mergers of high - mass galaxies , like those predicted to build giant ellipticals , must be occurring at higher redshift ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "if merger - induced star formation is the source of the majority of the infrared flux in these objects , it implies star formation rates of 1000s of m@xmath12 yr@xmath6 , like those suggested for some sub - mm sources @xcite .",
    "such massive sfrs would be capable of generating the supernova kinetic energy needed to drive a superwind and power the blobs .",
    "if supernovas deposit roughly 10@xmath38 ergs per solar mass of stars into the surrounding medium ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a star formation rate of 1000 m@xmath12 yr@xmath6 will easily match the 10@xmath39 ergs yr@xmath40 emitted by the blobs , even at a low efficency .",
    "mergers could also help drive gas inwards into a supermassive black hole , making agn another viable infrared energy source , with escaping ultraviolet radiation driving the blobs .",
    "@xcite found that their 24-detected blob is better fit by an agn spectral energy distribution than that of a star forming galaxy , but longer rest - wavelengths or a mid - ir spectrum are required for a definitive determination .",
    "there is one clearly starbursting galaxy at the northern end of their nebula .",
    "cooling flows also remain a possibility , as it might be common to find multiple galaxies merging at the center of such a large inward flow of gas .",
    "it does become a less favored model , however , as the energy from the cooling gas in no longer required to power the blobs .",
    "the ulirgs would appear to have more than enough energy in their budget to do so on their own .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under nasa contract 1407 .",
