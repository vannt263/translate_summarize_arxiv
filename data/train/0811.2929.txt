    "is therefore not sustained .",
    "the lifetimes of transients were found to be distributed according to exponentially decreasing laws in the form @xmath33 , see figure  [ f5 ] ( left ) .",
    "the early proposal , made by bottin and chat @xcite , that the characteristic times @xmath34 of the distributions were diverging as @xmath35 , was extracted from the results by simply taking the mean of the transients lifetimes at given @xmath6 ( fig .",

    ", transient behaviour with exponential distribution of lifetimes is associated to _ homoclinic tangles _",
    "@xcite , themselves resulting from the presence of nontrivial unstable periodic orbits in a low dimensional dynamical systems perspective .",
    "such solutions are known to exist both in ppf @xcite and in pcf @xcite and are furtively observed in experiments @xcite . since poincar s work ,",
    "the way a transverse intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of a limit cycle generates an uncountable infinity of intersections is well understood , as well as how complexity enters , through the symbolic dynamics attached to the modelling of that tangle in terms of smale s horseshoe .",
    "the exponential distribution of lifetimes of transient chaotic trajectories around the corresponding chaotic repellor then follows but , unfortunately , this nice application of the theory of low dimensional dynamical systems can not predict how the slopes of the distributions vary with @xmath6 . in this respect , the case of ppf is not completely settled , some results displaying exponential behaviour @xcite , others a `` critical '' behaviour @xmath37 for some global threshold @xmath25 with @xmath38 @xcite . a first reason explaining the observed discrepancies could be the experimental conditions since some experiments were performed at constant driving pressure gradient @xcite and others at constant mass flux @xcite . as suggested by our results on plane couette flow , another plausible possibility is linked to the fact that the physical system is not confined , but quasi-1d in physical space , i.e. confined in the radial direction , discretised in the azimuthal direction , but extended in the streamwise direction .",
    "recent results from r.r . kerswell and coll .",
    "( private communication ) seem to point in that direction .    taking for granted that the reduction of the dynamics to a 0d problem in physical space leaves aside interesting questions about the transitional regime in pcf , even more than in ppf , we now study its dynamics in a quasi-2d spatiotemporal context , i.e. depending on space in the streamwise ( @xmath13 ) and spanwise ( @xmath14 ) directions , while keeping confinement conditions in the cross - flow direction ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "in contrast with most numerical studies restricting the system size by placing in - plane periodic boundary conditions at small distances ( the size of the so - called _ minimal flow unit _ is typically @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the half - gap @xcite ) and implicitly analysing the results in a finite - dimensional dynamical systems framework , experiments reported above were performed in domains at least as large as @xmath18 .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the full navier  stokes equations in such domains are indeed not yet feasible with accuracy ( right ) . ]",
    "so that we have found it advisable to develop a spatiotemporal model . instead of a set of differential equations governing scalar amplitudes ( lorenz - like model ) , the resulting model was a set of partial differential equations for a few fields ( swift  hohenberg - like model )",
    ". it was obtained from primitive equations ( 3d ) through a systematic _ weighted residual approach _ , the galerkin method , which uses a basis that fulfils the no - slip boundary conditions and projects the residuals on the same basis @xcite . here",
    "a simple polynomial basis was chosen and the expansion was truncated at lowest nontrivial order thus freezing most of the cross - flow space dependence , while leaving the in - plane dependence free .",
    "this was justified by the fact that , in the lowest part of the transitional regime , experimental and numerical evidence suggests the existence of coherent patterns occupying the full gap @xmath11 with limited cross - stream structure @xcite .",
    "this restriction could of course be overcome but at a price of heavier analytical and numerical computations that we are not ready to pay for , since we mostly look for qualitative hints and not for quantitative agreement .    due to the way it is obtained , the model _ a priori _ displays the problem s most relevant general properties such as non - normal linear terms accounting for lift - up mechanism , linear viscous damping , nonlinear advection terms preserving perturbation kinetic energy , and linear stability of the base profile for all @xmath6 . numerical simulations _ a posteriori _",
    "show that it also shares many features of the complete physical system .",
    "in particular the statistics of homogeneous turbulent state no longer depends on the size of the simulation domain as soon as it is large enough ( extensivity property ) while the _ turbulent@xmath41laminar _ transition is indeed discontinuous with exponentially distributed transient lifetimes @xcite .    using this model ,",
    "our main objective has been to contribute to `` critical / exponential '' controversy in the pcf case ( with possible extrapolation to the ppf case ) and more particularly to point out the possible role of size effects .      in a first instance",
    "a @xmath42 system has been considered , which is of moderate size when compared to the size of coherent structures @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the state of the system was determined from its mean turbulent energy contents .",
    "the global stability threshold , with all the ambiguities the term covers , was determined by a combination of quench experiments , where @xmath6 is abruptly decreased from @xmath44 for which the flow is uniformly turbulent to variable @xmath45 , and annealing experiments where @xmath6 was quasi - adiabatically decreased . as a result , turbulence seemed sustained for @xmath6 greater than @xmath46 but definitely transient for @xmath47 : the time series of the mean turbulent energy presented well distinct long plateaus before unpredictable sudden decay happened .",
    "furthermore , the distributions of the transients lifetimes were clearly exponential and closely resembled the experimental ones depicted in figure  [ f5 ] ( left ) .",
    "the difference between the global threshold in the model @xmath48 and in the laboratory @xmath49 could be attributed to the under - estimation of viscous dissipation and energy transfer towards small cross - stream scales due to truncation . in spite of this lowering of the transitional regime by an empirical factor of about two ,",
    "most qualitative aspects of nonlinear processes seemed preserved , e.g. those linked to the development of turbulent spots @xcite .    the variation with @xmath6 of the decay rate of the lifetime histograms is given in figure  [ f8 ] , which shows well aligned points in lin - log scale , hence exponential behaviour , except for @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are mis - aligned .",
    "it turns out that this mis - alignment could not be explained by statistical errors , which suggests a crossover     in lin - lin scale ( left ) and in lin - log scale ( right).[f8],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   in lin - lin scale ( left ) and in lin - log scale ( right).[f8],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    to critical behaviour very close to @xmath52 , possibly linked to size effects .",
    "improving over this result was however beyond reach of numerical means and the visualisation of the velocity fields during decay did not help us discriminate between temporal and spatio - temporal behaviour .    in view of the typical size of streak segments mentioned earlier ,",
    "temporal behaviour remained plausible in the @xmath42 system .",
    "expecting that this will no longer be the case when confinement effects are made weaker , we considered a much larger system of size @xmath53 .      annealing experiments ( @xmath6 decreasing quasi - adiabatically ) first showed that turbulence could be maintained for very long times well below @xmath54 without any sign of decay . the time series of the mean turbulent energy shown in figure  [ f10 ] ( left ) was     system at @xmath55 .",
    "right : bifurcation diagram as obtained from the model in same system ( full line : average mean turbulent energy during the adiabatic decrease of @xmath6 ; open and filled dots : bracketing of the laminar / turbulent boundary for homogeneous low - level turbulent initial conditions ; open and filled square : bracketing of the frontier at a single point for a strongly inhomogeneous initial state.[f10],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0% ]   system at @xmath55 .",
    "right : bifurcation diagram as obtained from the model in same system ( full line : average mean turbulent energy during the adiabatic decrease of @xmath6 ; open and filled dots : bracketing of the laminar / turbulent boundary for homogeneous low - level turbulent initial conditions ; open and filled square : bracketing of the frontier at a single point for a strongly inhomogeneous initial state.[f10],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=43.0% ]    obtained in this way for @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast , relaxation at the end of a very long but regular and monotonic transient was observed for @xmath56 without any trace of plateau indicating that turbulence could be metastable .",
    "so , at least down to @xmath55 the turbulent state thus seems to be a local attractor and the continuous line in figure  [ f10 ] ( right ) indicates the variation of the corresponding mean turbulent energy as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "visualisations of the turbulent pattern at @xmath55 showed that , when the mean turbulent energy level was high , the system was in a state of fine - grained mixture of turbulent and laminar patches ( _ spatiotemporal intermittency _",
    "@xcite ) , whereas during the excursions toward comparatively low values , large laminar domains were present for relatively long lapses of time .",
    "an explanation to the exponential behaviour of the lifetime distributions , alternative to the accepted one in terms of chaotic saddles , could then be obtained by considering the large @xmath53 system as an assembly of 32 smaller @xmath42 sub - systems and comparing the typical dynamics of the sub - systems to that of the @xmath42 system @xcite .",
    "returning to the smaller system and comparing its time - series histograms at @xmath57 to those at @xmath52 , it could be seen that an exponential tail appeared at low energy when @xmath6 was decreased , so that , when @xmath6 was further decreased , excursions toward smaller and smaller energies were more frequent , forcing the decay of a given transient when some limiting energy , @xmath58 , was reached . setting this observation in the context of the sub - systems dynamics , one could then appeal to pomeau s analogy between sub - critical bifurcations in extended systems and _ first - order ( thermodynamic ) phase transitions _ @xcite and the related theory of nucleation : the advent of a sizable laminar domain in the large system implies an excursion of the mean energy towards smaller values ( e.g. @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] , left ) , though the system apparently remains in the sustained turbulent regime .",
    "such excursions correspond to the breakdown of turbulence over regions already larger than the size of a sub - domain , which is also the size of the smaller system . accordingly , while turbulence is relatively short - lived in the smaller system ( since the occurrence of such a fluctuation would have led the turbulent regime to its end ) , it can be long - lived in the larger system because a wide region that fell laminar can become turbulent again by contamination from its surroundings .",
    "this observation opens the way to the understanding of the whole ` turbulent  @xmath60  laminar ' transition in terms of directed percolation and statistical estimates that come with it @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the exponential decay of lifetime distributions in the smaller system thus rests on the idea that spatiotemporal fluctuations result in a random process exploring the low energy exponential tails of the mean turbulent energy histograms appearing when @xmath6 is small enough .",
    "while such a tail was indeed unobservable at @xmath57 , it was already sizable at @xmath52 , and quite substantial for @xmath55 provided that the histogram was determined under the condition that the system is still in the chaotic transient state , i.e. as long as @xmath61 .",
    "the argument was closed by saying that the uniformly random exploration of the low - energy exponential histogram tails converted itself into exponentially decreasing lifetime histogram tails .. ] unfortunately , like the conventional view , this new interpretation does not predict how the lin - log slopes vary since it does not tell us how the tail s importance changes with @xmath6 though the trend can be easily guessed . invoking a spatiotemporal origin to the shape of the lifetime distribution could however help us understand the possible presence of a cross - over from exponential to critical variation .",
    "evidence that the turbulent state for @xmath62 is a local attractor comes from the attempt to determine the frontier of its attraction basin as seen from the _",
    "laminar @xmath60 turbulent _ viewpoint .",
    "open and filled dots in figure  [ f10 ] ( right ) bracket the `` line '' separating random initial conditions with given initial mean turbulent energy obtained by attenuating the same homogeneous turbulent solution with variable factors . above the line",
    ", the system evolves toward the turbulent state whereas it relaxes below .",
    "however the frontier appears to be strongly dependent on the shape of the initial condition and this dependence is better understood in physical space than in phase space .",
    "for example the open and filled squares in figure  [ f10 ] ( right ) bracket the frontier corresponding to another kind of initial condition displaying wide laminar domains competing with the spatiotemporally intermittent state alluded to above .",
    "still another frontier would be obtained for transverse turbulent stripes ( parallel to the @xmath14 axis , not related to stripes in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) that are found to invade the system only when @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the threshold value for spanwise turbulent stripes and happens to depend on the fraction @xmath65 of the system occupied by the stripe at the initial time ( a single value @xmath66 has been studied , yielding @xmath67 ) . in the same way ,",
    "strong localised perturbations form spots that make the whole system tumble into the turbulent state only for @xmath68 but a precise determination of the corresponding threshold is barely feasible since it implies a three - parameter study by varying @xmath6 , the initial size and amplitude of the perturbation .",
    "long range interactions associated to pressure effects , well accounted for in the model , also seem to play an important role .",
    "to conclude , for decaying turbulence , the nucleation of sufficiently large laminar domains seems to provide a good understanding of the origin of the exponentially decreasing distribution of the transients lifetimes at given size , though a more complete study of the variation of the decay rates with @xmath6 combined with size effects is needed , which is currently underway .",
    "though it has the same observable consequence as the saddle interpretation , this new approach clearly points to a spatiotemporal perspective that seems better suited than the strictly temporal one since spatial extension is a crucial feature of the problem . for onset , things are even much more complicated since the transition depends sensitively on the shape and amplitude of the initial condition and on the reynolds number .",
    "furthermore , it seems difficult to find a definite connection between our different results obtained in a spatiotemporal context and the search for _ edge states _ that have been much studied recently in a finite dimensional framework for both the pcf and the ppf @xcite .",
    "the transition to turbulence in wall flows leaves several problems open .",
    "most difficulties stem from the nature of the non - trivial solution competing with the base state .",
    "answers to this question have been looked for first within linear stability theory extended to take into account transient energy growth induced by non - normality , and next using the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and temporal chaos .",
    "accordingly , special periodic solutions ( travelling waves ) have been found , that serve as a skeleton for complex dynamics described in an abstract phase space in terms of _ homoclinic tangles _ and _ chaotic transients_. this approach is however fully valid for confined systems and can only be applied to open systems at the price of putting artificial periodic boundary conditions at small distances in at least one ( ppf is quasi-1d ) , if not two ( pcf is quasi-2d ) directions of physical space . while the theory of chaotic transients well explains the exponential behaviour of the lifetime distributions , it does not account for the variation of their inverse decay rate with @xmath6 , which was found exponential in some cases and critical in others .",
    "taking another point of view , pomeau long ago proposed an analogy of this kind of discontinuous bifurcation to a first - order ( thermodynamic ) phase transition @xcite and put forward a related nucleation problem @xcite . in the same time , he introduced the concept of transition to turbulence _ via spatiotemporal intermittency _ , a contamination process where above some threshold , _ activity _ invade the system whereas it dies below it @xcite .",
    "the spatio - temporally intermittent state is a mixture of active and quiescent domains .",
    "though at the time of the proposal , people focused mostly on the universality properties of the continuous transition @xcite , examples of discontinuous transitions were known .",
    "one of them was put in relation with the transition to turbulence in pcf @xcite but the results were not reliable since the model was too far from concrete hydrodynamics . keeping all this in mind , we developed a model which , instead of proceeding to full dimensional reduction in physical space , just froze part of the wall - normal dependence . in spite of an insufficient energy transfer through cross - stream ( small ) scales which led to a lowered transitional range",
    ", it correctly accounted for the interplay of streamwise vortices and streaks ( large in - plane structures ) and qualitatively reproduced hydrodynamical features , e.g. non - local pressure effects , and transitional properties .",
    "even in the absence of firm conclusions ( the work is still in progress ) , the most interesting results are a better appreciation of the drawbacks of the dynamical systems approach , and some support to the phase transition viewpoint .",
    "it indeed suggests a different interpretation of the transients lifetime distribution in systems of moderate size and offers a glimpse on the origin of complications arising from size effects and the role of topology of laminar / turbulent domains in pcf .",
    "the approach also suggests to look at ppf along similar lines by considering it as a quasi-1d system and not as a 0d system in physical space .",
    "apart from perspectives open for other wall flows and flow control , the present approach and its spatiotemporal re - framing may help us better understand the _ nature _ of the turbulent attractor with respect to some `` thermodynamic '' approach to far - from - equilibrium systems to be defined in a firm statistical physics environment .",

    "<S> contrasting with free shear flows presenting velocity profiles with inflection points which cascade to turbulence in a relatively mild way , wall bounded flows are deprived of ( inertial ) instability modes at low reynolds numbers and become turbulent in a much wilder way , most often marked by the coexistence of laminar and turbulent domains at intermediate reynolds numbers , well below the range where ( viscous ) instabilities can show up @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there can even be no unstable mode at all , as for plane couette flow ( pcf ) or for poiseuille pipe flow ( ppf ) that currently are the subject of intense research . though the mechanisms involved in the transition to turbulence in wall flows are now better understood @xcite , statistical properties of the transition itself are yet unsatisfactorily assessed . </S>",
    "<S> a widely accepted interpretation rests on nontrivial solutions of the navier  </S>",
    "<S> stokes equations in the form of unstable travelling waves @xcite and on transient chaotic states associated to chaotic repellors @xcite . whether these concepts typical of the theory of _ temporal _ chaos are really appropriate is yet unclear owing to the fact that , strictly speaking , they apply when confinement in physical space is effective while the physical systems considered are rather extended in at least one space direction , so that spatiotemporal behaviour can not be ruled out in the transitional regime . </S>",
    "<S> the case of pcf @xcite will be examined in this perspective through numerical simulations of a model with reduced cross - stream ( @xmath0 ) dependence , focusing on the in - plane ( @xmath1 ) space dependence of a few velocity amplitudes.@xcite in the large aspect - ratio limit , the transition to turbulence takes place _ via _ spatiotemporal intermittency @xcite and we shall attempt to make a connection with the theory of first order ( thermodynamic ) phase transitions , as suggested long ago by y. pomeau @xcite .    * </S>",
