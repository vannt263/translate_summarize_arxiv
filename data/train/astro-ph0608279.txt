    "the star hd160691 ( @xmath0  ara ) is a sun - like main - sequence dwarf monitored by the long - term , precision radial velocity ( rv ) surveys .",
    "it has been observed over more than 7  years by the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) planet search team and by the geneva planet search team ( coralie and harps spectrometers ) .",
    "the work of the aat team lead to the discovery of a jupiter like companion hd160691b in about 630  days orbit @xcite .",
    "one year later , @xcite confirmed the jovian planet and discovered a linear trend in the rv data revealing a signature of the second , more distant body . in the next paper , @xcite published a new orbital solution with the orbital period of the long - period planet hd160691c about 3000  days and the eccentricity @xmath7 . the same year , @xcite , using observations done with the ultra precise harps spectrometer , announced @xmath8 earth - mass planet hd160691d in @xmath3  days orbit .",
    "that discovery is a breakthrough in the field as the long - term precision of spectrometers approaches @xmath9  m / s . actually , the instrumental errors are much smaller than the rv variability ( stellar jitter ) induced by the sun - like stars themselves .",
    "recently , @xcite published a new updated set of 108 observations of @xmath0  ara , spanning 2551  days ( about 7.5  yr ) .",
    "thanks to the updates in the ucles instrument installed at the aat and the software pipeline @xcite , the long - term precision of the measurements is amazing .",
    "it also reaches @xmath9  m / s at the end of the observational window and is kept at the mean level of @xmath10  m / s over its whole length .",
    "this paper is devoted to the analysis of the rv observations of @xmath0  ara using the so called gamp approach ( an acronym of genetic algorithm with megno penalty ) that makes explicit the use of newtonian , self - consistent @xmath4-body model of the stars reflex motion , dynamical properties of the planetary system and the copernican principle @xcite .",
    "this algorithm makes it possible to derive meaningful bounds on the elements of the outermost planet in spite of the fact that the data cover only a part of the longest orbital period . without the dynamical constrains ,",
    "the kinematical as well as pure newtonian best fits to the @xmath0  ara rv tend to show large eccentricity of the outermost companion and then the system becomes catastrophically unstable .",
    "we verify the results of the previous papers based on a much smaller number of relatively less accurate rv observations .",
    "the results of the analysis of the new rv data set greatly improved and extended over time by @xcite lead us to a conclusion that the @xmath0  ara may host _ four _ planets in quasi - circular orbits , including a new , jupiter - like object in @xmath5  days orbit ( hd160691e ) .",
    "the new best fit solution describes the orbital architecture of this extrasolar system as very different from the previous ones .    shortly after submitting the manuscript , we learned about an independent work by @xcite who announced a very similar orbital solution and also the fourth planet in the @xmath0  ara system .",
    "these authors study a different set of the rv measurements but the conclusions of the two papers are in an excellent agreement .",
    "still , in this paper we focus our attention on the analysis of the aat data along the lines of the originally submitted manuscript . however , the last section  5 is devoted to a preliminary study of the full available data set , including the new measurements published by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we verify a hypothesis of the 1:1  mmr in the subsystem of two jovian planets .",
    "according to the previous papers devoted to @xmath0  ara , the time range of the updated data set published by @xcite should be already close to the orbital period of the outermost companion . in that case",
    ", we can try to recover a good approximation of the system parameters by modeling the rv signal with the keplerian orbits .",
    "although for mutually interacting systems the kinematic model often leads to unstable orbital configurations , thanks to the numerical simplicity it can be very helpful to rapidly determine putative solutions and interesting ranges of orbital parameters .",
    "the contribution of every planet to the reflex motion of the parent star at time @xmath11 is the following @xcite : @xmath12 + v_0 , \\label{eq : eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the semi - amplitude , @xmath14 the argument of pericenter , @xmath15 the true anomaly involving implicit dependence on the orbital period @xmath16 and the time of periastron passage @xmath17 , @xmath18 the eccentricity , and @xmath19 is the velocity offset .",
    "some argue that it is best to interpret the derived fit parameters @xmath20 in terms of keplerian elements and minimal masses related to jacobi coordinates @xcite .",
    "we follow their reasoning when calculating the orbital elements from the primary fit parameters .",
    "the extensive exploration of the multi - parameter @xmath21 space is efficient enough if one applies a kind of a hybrid optimization @xcite .",
    "the idea of this algorithm relies on two steps , global and local ones . in the first step ,",
    "we search for potentially good ( but not very accurate ) solutions in a global manner . during the second step",
    "these solutions become initial conditions to a precise and fast local algorithm .",
    "the single program run starts the genetic algorithm ( gas ) .",
    "in particular , we apply the pikaia code by @xcite .",
    "the gas have important advantages over more popular gradient - type methods @xcite .",
    "the power of gas lies in their basically global nature , the requirement of knowing only the @xmath21 function , and the ease of constrained optimization ; gas permit defining parameter bounds according to specific requirements , or adding a penalty term to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "however , the best fits found with gas are ( in principle ) not very accurate in terms of @xmath21 or rms , so we refine them with another non - gradient algorithm , the simplex method of melder and nead  @xcite .",
    "usually , we run such hybrid procedure thousands of times , and then we analyse the ensemble of gathered fits .",
    "that helps us to detect local minima of @xmath21 that are sometimes very distant in the parameter space and to get reliable approximation of the global topology of @xmath21 .",
    "we tested the code extensively @xcite , and we found many examples confirming its robustness and reliability .",
    "remarkably , the code works with minimal requirements for user - supplied information : basically , one should only define the model function [ so called _ fitness function _",
    ", usually equal to @xmath22  conveniently , it is the same for the gas and simplex , and to determine ( even very roughly ) parameter bounds for the assumed number of planets .",
    "we underline that the code is fft - free , and by its construction , it works without any _ a - priori _ determination of the orbital periods .    in some cases ( like strongly resonant or interacting systems , noisy data , a small number of measurements )",
    "the kinematic fits may lead to unrealistic , rapidly disrupting configurations . then a more elaborate @xmath4-body newtonian model of the rv",
    "should be applied @xcite .",
    "yet the hybrid optimization can be still used as a general approach of exploring the parameter space ( only the model function is changed ) .",
    "actually , even more general modeling of the rv data relies on the elimination of the unstable ( strongly chaotic ) solutions _ during _ the fit process . that self - consistent approach follows the copernican principle and the complex structure of the phase space predicted by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser theorem @xcite",
    "the idea of the dynamical fits with stability constraints relies on modifying the @xmath21 function by a penalty term employing an efficient fast indicator megno @xcite .",
    "we describe that method ( gamp ) in detail in our past works @xcite .    to obtain reliable estimates of the fitted parameter errors , the internal measurement errors should be rescaled @xcite according to @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the internal error and adopted dispersion of stellar jitter , respectively , and @xmath26 is the joint uncertainty .",
    "typically , we choose @xmath25 following the estimates for sun - like dwarfs by @xcite , or we use the value adopted by the discovery teams .",
    "the jitter estimate for @xmath0  ara by @xcite is 3.5  m / s and we use this value in our calculations .",
    "the analysis of the short time - scale rv variability of the parent star may be found in @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the parent star are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we carried out an extensive analysis of the rv measurements published by @xcite and @xcite assuming that there exist two jupiter companions of @xmath0  ara . by employing the dynamical @xmath4-body model and gamp ,",
    "we obtained meaningful limits on the barely constrained orbital parameters of the putative outermost planet . according to our results",
    ", @xmath27 should be roughly greater that @xmath28  au and @xmath29 in the range of the smallest permissible semi - major axes .",
    "the new precision rv data published by @xcite give us an excellent opportunity to verify these conclusions .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the results of the hybrid search for the putative three - planet configurations , in terms of multi - planet keplerian model , assuming that the innermost planet has @xmath30 $ ]  days and @xmath31 $ ] , and that two jupiter - like planets are in orbits with @xmath32 $ ]  days , @xmath33 $ ]  days , and @xmath34 $ ] , respectively .",
    "these safe assumptions are consistent with the results of a few papers devoted to @xmath0  ara . in particular",
    ", we rely on the careful analysis by @xcite and @xcite that revealed the hot - neptune hd160691d",
    ". we might expect that its signal @xmath35  m / s is comparable to the error level of the aat data , nevertheless we decide to add this planet to the model , not to avoid the _ a - priori _ information on the system architecture .",
    "it appears that the hot - neptune signal improves the rms by @xmath36  m / s , so it could be important to obtain a precise solution for the whole system .",
    "the best fits obtained in the search are illustrated by projections onto the planes of particular parameters of the rv model , eq .  1 .",
    "here , we choose the @xmath37- and @xmath38-planes . marking the elements within the formal @xmath39 confidence intervals of the best - fit solution ( signed by two crossing lines )",
    ", we have a convenient way of visualizing the shape of the local minima of @xmath21 and obtaining realistic and reasonable estimates of the parameter errors @xcite .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the parameters of @xmath40 different fits within the @xmath41 confidence interval of the best fit  i ( its parameters are given in table  1 ) .",
    "remarkably , the orbital period @xmath42  days and the semi - amplitude @xmath43  m / s are very close to the independent estimates by @xcite , on the basis of harps measurements .",
    "thus in spite of the rv contribution of the hot - neptune planet  d ( of the inferred @xmath44  earth - masses ) being on the noise level @xmath45  m / s , the planet is already `` visible '' also in the aat measurements .",
    "the two - planet keplerian model of the rv yields in eq .  1 are ( 37.52  m / s , 630.31  days , 0.269",
    ", 259.63  deg , 13401.53  days ) , and ( 18.10  m / s , 2499.16  days , 0.466 , 184.04  deg , 11032.98  days ) , @xmath46  m / s , @xmath47jd2,440,000 . ] @xmath48 and an rms @xmath49  m / s , so the signal of hd160691d improves the fit by @xmath50  m / s . yet in the next section , we are trying to find much better arguments supporting this claim .    in turn",
    ", the elements of the jupiter - like companions seem constrained very well . for a reference , the synthetic curve and the data points are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "an rms of fit  i is @xmath45  m / s and its @xmath51 .",
    "the best - fit three - planet solution found here is very similar to the one quoted by @xcite , see their table  3 . the orbital period ratio close to 4:1 suggests a proximity of the jovian planets to the 4:1  mean motion resonance ( mmr ) .",
    "unfortunately , the system is again catastrophically unstable due to a large eccentricity of the outer planet ( @xmath52 and a proximity of both orbits to the collision zone , i.e. , the area close to the planetary collision line determined by @xmath53 .",
    "however , it is well known that orbits involved in low - order mmrs may be stable even if they are crossing each other @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we re - analyse the rv of hd  108874 @xcite that appears to host two jovian planets very close to the same type of the 4:1  mmr .",
    "the dynamical map of this system reveals that the eccentricity of the outer planet could be as large as 0.7 in the stable resonance island , although already for @xmath54 the osculating orbits would cross . in the same way",
    ", the exact 4:1  mmr could explain large @xmath55 in the three - planet @xmath0  ara system . to examine more carefully the stability of the best - fit configuration , we computed dynamical maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) in the @xmath56-plane , in terms of the spectral number ( @xmath57 ) @xcite and the @xmath58 indicator ( the maximal eccentricity attained during the integration time - span ) .",
    "in particular , every point in these maps represents an initial condition that was integrated over @xmath59  yr ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the dynamical maps reveal a few dominant low - order mmrs : like 4b:1c , 9b:2c and 5b:1c in the neighborhood of fit  i , marked by a crossed circle ( @xmath61 means the @xmath62  mmr of planets `` b '' and `` c '' ) .",
    "clearly , the best - fit keplerian configuration lies in a strongly chaotic zone  au and large @xmath63 , on the basis of rv data from @xcite extended by measurements published graphically in @xcite .",
    "however , we could not find any stable solution in its close neighborhood . ] .",
    "a simple change of the keplerian best - fit @xmath64 to @xmath65 , providing a stable system , leads to a significant increase of @xmath21 , so we tried to find an optimal stable solution with gamp .",
    "due to a large cpu requirement caused by the short - period orbit of the innermost low - mass hd160691d that planet has been skipped in this test .",
    "we searched for the two - planet solutions only . in the penalty function @xcite we integrated the megno over @xmath66 .",
    "it is a relatively short time but it enables us to rule out strongly chaotic ( and rapidly disrupting ) systems .",
    "the results of that search are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] were projections of the best - fit parameters onto the dynamical maps in the @xmath56-plane are shown . only the solutions within the @xmath67 confidence interval of the best fit ( marked by the largest circle ,",
    "see also caption to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] for its osculating elements ) are shown .",
    "let us note that this best - fit solution has been refined by gamp integrations over @xmath68 and the solution appears to be rigorously stable .",
    "an rms of these two - planet fits is @xmath69  m / s and their @xmath70 .",
    "the scatter of the best - fit parameters is small but we can not decide whether the system is locked in the exact 4:1  mmr .",
    "more likely it evolves close to its separatrix ( outside the resonance island ) .",
    "note that the fits with the largest @xmath64 ( to the left of the resonance island ) are in fact mildly chaotic .",
    "the presence of the neptune - like companion does not lead to any qualitative changes in the dynamical character of the best fit configurations although it yields a lower rms @xmath71  m / s ( for _ stable _ configurations ) .",
    "the results of modeling the rv data by the three - planet configurations seem in an overall agreement with the conclusions of our previous work @xcite .",
    "however , we found that the data published in @xcite rather exclude the possibility of a stable 4:1  mmr between the jovian planets .",
    "the acceptable ( stable ) solutions should have @xmath27 roughly not smaller than @xmath28  au .",
    "the corresponding orbital period is significantly longer , by @xmath72  days , from the current apparently very precise estimate of @xmath73  days found on the basis of the new data set .",
    "still , although the observational window already covers about one outermost period @xmath74 and the data strongly constrain @xmath21 , both the kinematic as well as the newtonian model of the rv yield catastrophically unstable orbital configurations .    that lead us to look for an explanation of the strange inconsistency .",
    "the most natural one could follow from the existence of an additional planet that has been hidden up till now due to the small number of measurements and their significant errors ( @xmath45",
    "m / s , as quoted in the older papers by the aat team ) .",
    "the problem reminds us of the study of the hd  37124 data @xcite . for this star ,",
    "the two - planet fits are strongly unstable due to the extreme eccentricity of the outer companion , @xmath75 .",
    "recently , @xcite has shown that the assumption of three - planets makes it possible to improve the fits and , simultaneously , the best - fit orbits become close to circular ones .",
    "the system can also be easily stabilized in such a regime @xcite without any degradation @xmath21 and the rms .",
    "further , we follow the results of @xcite who detected the short - period planet  d around @xmath0  ara with ultra - precise harps observations . in particular , we are attracted by the analysis of the short - time scatter of rv during several subsequent nights ( see their table  1 and fig .",
    "that statistics measures the rv variability imposed by the star activity itself .",
    "the standard deviation of these variations over one night is between 1.52.5  m / s .",
    "it could mean that @xmath25 is in fact less than 3.5  m / s that we adopted here . instead , assuming @xmath76  m / s we got @xmath77 for the best - fit three - planet model and the rms @xmath45  m / s has @xmath78",
    "m / s excess over @xmath79  m / s ( the mean of @xmath80 is @xmath81  m / s ) . in such a case ,",
    "the three - planet model is not fully adequate for explaining the rv variability and that the presence of an additional , yet undetected planet , is statistically justified .",
    "to verify the hypothesis about the four - planet system , we again used the hybrid code driven by the kinematic model of the rv .",
    "this time we assumed that _ all _ orbital periods are in the range of @xmath82 $ ]  days .",
    "the statistics of the best fits gathered in the search are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "we marked @xmath40 different solutions yielding @xmath21 within the @xmath41 confidence interval of the best fit with @xmath83  days , @xmath84 , and an rms of 2.276  m / s ( marked by crossing lines ) .",
    "however , after a check by megno integrations @xcite , we found that this fit leads to a chaotic configuration , so we selected another stable ( quasi - periodic ) solution with very similar @xmath85 , an rms of 2.276  m / s and @xmath86  days .",
    "its orbital parameters are given in table  2 and we call it fit  ii from hereafter",
    ". we use that initial condition to demonstrate some orbital properties of the @xmath0  ara system .",
    "we tried to refine this solution by the self - consistent @xmath4-body model of the rv but we could not improve it significantly ; the osculating elements also did not change .    in general , the four - planet solutions have much smaller rms ( by @xmath87  m / s ) than the three - body configurations and they impose the new , @xmath88-mass jovian planet , much closer to the star than the companion hd160691b in @xmath89  days orbit detected a few years ago .",
    "the most striking feature of the four - planet configurations is low eccentricity of all orbits .",
    "they are roughly less than 0.2 for all jovian planets .",
    "the innermost hot - neptune planet  d has the initial @xmath90 , nevertheless , it is not well constrained and any value in the ( assumed ) range [ 0,0.3 ] is equally likely in terms of the @xmath67 confidence interval .",
    "simultaneously , the orbital periods of the two inner jupiter - like companions , @xmath91  days and @xmath92  d appear to be bounded very well with the accuracy range of a few days .",
    "this is not the case for the outermost planet  c  the @xmath67 error of @xmath74 is about 1500  days .",
    "thus the four - planet model changes completely the topology of @xmath21 .",
    "yet the outermost planet would have the semi - major axis very similar to that of jupiter . according to the conclusions of @xcite , the orbit of planet  d should be almost edge - on . hence assuming that the entire system is coplanar",
    ", we may expect that the minimal masses determined from the keplerian fits are likely close to the real ones .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6 ] illustrates in subsequent panels the synthetic curve of the best - fit system ( fit ii , table  2 ) and the period - phased rv signals of the planets d , e , b , and  c. the resulting curve closely follows all the measurement points .",
    "the rms is only @xmath93  m / s .",
    "as we expected , its value is comparable with the joint error @xmath26 if we assume that @xmath94  m / s .",
    "this indicates a statistically perfect solution .",
    "the next panel shows the raw lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite of the data .",
    "besides the dominant signal of planet  b , there are only visible peaks about 32  days and 225  days . simultaneously",
    ", the periods of @xmath3  days and @xmath5  days seem to be completely absent in the periodogram .",
    "the period of @xmath95  days is close to the rotational period @xmath96 of the star derived from the index @xmath97 by @xcite .",
    "however , it is not consistent with another estimate of @xmath98  days by @xcite who analyzed the short - term variability of the rv spectrum of @xmath0  ara .",
    "we have no good explanation for the @xmath99 days period as we did not find any reasonable solution consistent with its value .",
    "most likely , it is an alias of the @xmath100  days period .",
    "instead , there exist other apparently precise fits having periods uncorrelated with the periodogram , for instance , ( 2.332  m / s , 90.19  days , 0.30 , 3.739  deg , 14391.686  days ) , ( 12.298  m / s , 517.578  days , 0.581 , 157.537  deg , 13841.816  days ) , ( 39.010  m / s , 621.323  days , 0.267 , 259.890  deg , 10908.948  days ) , and ( 21.580  m / s , 2459.212  days , 0.475 , 183.853  days , 13542.752  days ) , in terms of parameter tuples of eq .",
    "1 , yielding an rms @xmath101  m / s ( @xmath17 are shifted by jd2,440,000 ) .",
    "however , these solutions are very unstable .",
    "we analyse such alternative solutions in section  5.1 .",
    "another unusual coincidence of periods is the ratio @xmath102 . that may also indicate an aliasing in the data . nevertheless , the signal of @xmath103  m / s exceeds by a few times the errors of data and our experiments show that it can not be fitted well by the signal of the hot - neptune planet itself .",
    "still , it remains possible that the periodic signal of the putative planet  e is an alias of the rotational period because @xmath104 if @xmath105  days and @xmath106 if @xmath107  days .",
    "then the rv variability could be attributed to a moving spot on the star surface . however , in the observations of @xcite there is no sign of abnormally large variations of the rv ( exceeding the amplitude of the hot - neptune signal ) during about 80  days , covering already a few @xmath96 .",
    "it is a good argument justifying the planetary origin of the signal with the period of @xmath108  days .",
    "finally , we investigate whether the hot - neptune hd160691d can be reliably detected in the aat data alone . because we fit a multi - period orbital model to a small number of measurements ,",
    "there is always a risk of generating a periodic signal through random fluctuations . to determine the confidence level of a weak signal in the data , we apply the so called test of scrambled residuals @xcite , see also our paper @xcite",
    "having the best fit ( fit  ii ) in hand , we remove the synthetic rv contributions of the jovian planets from the measurements .",
    "next , we randomly scramble the residuals , keeping the exact moments of observations , and we search for the best - fit elements of the putative planetary signal . to speed up the search , we limit the period range to [ 2,128 ]  days .",
    "we use again the hybrid code .",
    "thanks to a large population size ( 1024 ) and the number of generations ( 256 ) , the gas reliably find the best fits to the single - planet model ; yet the fits are then refined with the simplex .",
    "after many repetitions of such a procedure , we get a gaussian - like histogram of @xmath21 of the best fits to the synthetic sets of residuals .",
    "if the real data were uncorrelated , the value of their @xmath21 should be found in the range spanned by the histogram .",
    "that histogram of @xmath109 keplerian fits to scrambled residuals is shown in the right - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . clearly , the likelihood that the residual signal is only a white noise is negligible . for a reference , we computed the lomb - scargle periodogram of the original residuals ( the left - bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "the strongest peak at @xmath110  days is consistent with the estimate of @xmath111 in the hybrid search ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "these results support independently the detection of the hot - neptune hd160691d by @xcite and prove the excellent quality of the aat data .",
    "to investigate the long - term stability of the best - fit configuration , we employed the megno indicator computed by the symplectic algorithm @xcite . in the first test , we integrated the entire four - planet system ( with the initial condition fit  ii given in table  2 ) over @xmath112  yr .",
    "it appears to be rigorously stable which according to the theory of the fast indicator is indicated by megno rapidly converging to the value of 2 .",
    "because the low - mass innermost planet revolves very close to the parent star , its influence on the secular dynamics is negligible .",
    "thus in the next experiments we considered the three - jovian system only . the results of the integrations conducted over 50  myr are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "such period of time corresponds to @xmath113 and is long enough to detect possible secular instability .",
    "still the megno converges perfectly to  2 and that indicates a stable quasi - periodic solution .",
    "indeed , the eccentricities and semi - major axes are almost constant over this time .    in order to illustrate the dynamical environment of the @xmath0  ara system",
    ", we also computed the dynamical maps in terms of the spectral number and @xmath58 in the ( @xmath114-plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "these maps reveal that the nominal position of planet  b is close to the island of 2:1  mmr with the planet  e. yet none of the critical angles of this resonance librate in the nominal best - fit configuration .",
    "we found only some signs of the apsidal anti - corotation ( see the left - lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "such dynamical character of the @xmath0  ara system is puzzling in the light of what is known about four extrasolar systems presumably locked in the exact 2:1  mmr , i.e. , gliese  876 @xcite , hd  82943 @xcite , hd  128311 @xcite and hd  73526 @xcite .",

    "one should be aware that @xmath115 ( and the resulting minimal masses ) as well as @xmath74 can be significantly varied within the @xmath67 confidence range of the best fit .",
    "moreover , not all keplerian fits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] are necessarily stable .",
    "thus the gamp search would be very helpful to get a more detailed self - consistent statistics of the stable solutions . in this work we skipped such a test due to its significant numerical expense caused by the extremely different orbital periods .",

    "the integration time @xmath116 ( @xmath117  myr ) is long enough to detect unstable solutions related to the short - term two- and three - body mmrs and also strongest secular resonances .",
    "a detection of all secular instabilities would require much longer integration times @xmath118@xmath119  yr because the secular periods , as the apsidal period of the outermost orbit , are @xmath59  yr .    the results of this experiment are shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "the best - fit solutions have an rms @xmath120  m / s .",
    "globally there is only a little improvement of the newtonian fits when compared to the keplerian solutions .",
    "the mutual interactions are not yet clearly evident in the aat data .",
    "the overall distribution of the newtonian fits in the @xmath56-plane mimics the projection of the kinematic solutions onto the @xmath121-plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "there is a well defined minimum of rms [ and @xmath21 ] in the @xmath123-planes , but the semi - major axis of planet  c may be varied over 2  au within the limit of rms @xmath124  m / s .",
    "we examined the stability of all such fits .",
    "the stable initial conditions ( with @xmath125 ) are marked with filled yellow circles .",
    "we notice that the stable fits appear for @xmath126 .",
    "it remains likely that by altering the orbital phases or other parameters ( like masses ) within the acceptable error bounds , we can find reasonably precise and stable solutions also for @xmath127 .",
    "however , this procedure would require the self - consistent gamp - like search .",
    "shortly after submitting the original manuscript , we learned about an independent work by @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are in a great agreement with the results of their analysis although these authors study a completely different and independent set of the rv data : the measurements published by @xcite , data gathered with coralie and observations collected during @xmath128  year campaign with the harps spectrometer . having access to the new extended observations , we can discuss some of the conclusions derived on the basis of the new aat data alone .    in a number of experiments",
    ", we considered three data sets : s1  108  points by the aat @xcite as analyzed already , s2  the set s1 extended by the coralie measurements ( with errors rescaled by @xmath129  m / s ) and 78  measurements from harps ( the original errors are unmodified ) and s3  the set composed of only the aat and harps data .",
    "note , that from the coralie and harps observations @xcite , we substracted the mean of all rv measurements in the given set , respectively .",
    "using the most precise s3 set which covers the whole observational window , we carried out the hybrid search for the four - planet keplerian fits including two independent instrumental rv offsets . as in the previous test , the orbital periods of _ all _ planets are bounded to the range of @xmath130 $ ]  days .",
    "the best keplerian fit is similar to fit  ii , i.e. , in terms of the parameter tuples of eq .  1 , ( 3.118  m / s , 9.636  days , 0.164 , 211.68  deg , 302.852  days ) , ( 10.849  m / s , 307.937  days , 0.127 , 180.752  deg , 3323.904  days ) , ( 37.147  m / s , 649.500  days , 0.000 , 231.352  deg , 2734.35  days ) , ( 24.056  m / s , 4293.506  days , 0.054 , 90.829  deg , 3319.1  days ) , for planets d , e , b , c , respectively and velocity offsets @xmath131  m / s , @xmath132  m / s ( @xmath17",
    "are shifted by jd2,450,000 ) .",
    "this fit has @xmath133 and an rms @xmath134  m / s .",
    "next , we refined @xmath2 different solutions gathered in the hybrid search using the newtonian code . similarly to the case of the aat data only ( s1 ) , we also performed the stability check of the best - fit configurations .",
    "for the s2 set ( see the middle panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig9 ] ) , the smallest rms of the best - fit solutions is @xmath135  m / s , significantly more than that one obtained for the s1 set alone ( 2.3  m / s ) ; likely due to a relatively low accuracy and scatter of the corlie data .",
    "the best fits to the s3 data yield an rms @xmath136@xmath137  m / s also larger by @xmath138-@xmath139  m / s from the rms obtained for the s1 set .",
    "also their @xmath140 suggest that the errors of the harps measurements could be underestimated in the long - run .",
    "hence finally we minimized the rms instead of @xmath21 . in this case",
    "( see the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) , the rms of the best fits is smaller than for the s1 set alone , @xmath141  m / s .",
    "for instance , a stable solution , given in terms of tuples @xmath142 , a~[\\mbox{au } ] , e , \\omega~[\\mbox{deg } ] , { \\cal m}~[\\mbox{deg}])$ ] : ( 0.032 , 0.09286 , 0.135 , 204.663 , 272.050 ) , ( 0.506 , 0.9393 , 0.083 , 204.913 , 293.54 ) , ( 1.696 , 1.533 , 0.062 , 45.56 , 4.039 ) , ( 1.926 , 5.134 , 0.053 , 103.06 , 156.057 ) , for planets d , e , b , c , respectively , with velocity offsets @xmath143  m / s and @xmath144  m / s yields an rms @xmath145  m / s .    still , for all the analyzed sets s1 , s2 and s3 , the orbital parameters ( @xmath146 ) are allowed to vary in relatively wide ranges qualitatively similar to the ones we determined for the aat data only . yet the shapes of the minima are much more irregular than those found for the set s1 .",
    "clear limits of stable solutions in the ( @xmath147)-planes are evident .",
    "having the ensemble of stable fits , we also try to explain the apparent lack of locking of the subsystem e - b in the 2:1  mmr .",
    "because the elements of the inner giants are well constrained , we selected three best fits to the s3 data ( all yielding an rms @xmath141@xmath148  m / s ) with @xmath149  au , respectively ; also fit  ii ( @xmath150  au ) may be put in this short sequence .",
    "next , we calculated the dynamical maps in the @xmath151-plane in the neighborhood of the selected solutions . these maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] ) reveal very sharp borders of stable motions around @xmath152 , in an excellent agreement with the megno tests ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "the outermost planet strongly modifies the dynamics of the e - b pair . for a moderate distance of planet  c from the e - b subsystem",
    ", there is no evident 2:1  mmr island at all .",
    "it shows up for @xmath27 larger than @xmath153@xmath154  au and for relatively large eccentricities ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "however , such large eccentricities are ruled out in the model by the stability constraints .",
    "remarkably , the keplerian and @xmath4-body fits to all the data sets ( s1,s2,s3 ) reveal a number of low rms solutions corresponding to the 1b:1e mmr of the planets e and  b. this possibility is also investigated by @xcite but they did not report any stable 1:1 mmr solutions .",
    "the 1:1  mmr configurations are quite frequent in the solar system .",
    "there are also speculations on the existence of such extrasolar configurations @xcite . for a closer analysis we selected the fits to the s3 set .",
    "the newtonian best - fit solutions with @xmath155 are illustrated in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] .",
    "their quality is comparable with the ones related to the 2e:1b  mmr",
    ". nevertheless , all these 1e:1b  mmr configurations are strongly unstable leading to a quick collision between the planets . due to extremely strong dynamical interactions ,",
    "even small errors of the phases or other parameters may be critical for the system stability .",
    "thus in a close proximity of apparently unstable solutions , stable systems consistent with the rv observations may still exist .",
    "we tried to `` stabilize '' such fits with gamp , in terms of the three - jovian planets model ( that is again due to the efficiency reasons ) .",
    "unfortunately , we did not find any long - term stable best - fits as precise as the ones of the 2e:1b  mmr configurations .",
    "however , there exist _ stable _ 1e:1b  mmr solutions with reasonably small rms @xmath156",
    "m / s ( @xmath157  m / s for the whole , four - planet system ) .",
    "a synthetic curve of an example configuration fitting well the most precise aat and harps measurements , is illustrated in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ( the orbital elements are given in the caption ) .",
    "a striking result is illustrated in the dynamical map of that best - fit ( see the right - bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig11 ] ) .",
    "it reveals the island of stable motions extending over 0.2  au in @xmath158 and covering _ the entire _ range of @xmath159 ! the selected solution is stable over the secular time - scale .",
    "we show the results of 1  gyr direct integration of the system including the planets b , c and  e ( see the left - bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) .",
    "the apsides of e - b subsystem are anti - aligned , librating around @xmath160 with the semi - amplitude of @xmath161 and with @xmath162 varying up to 0.5 and @xmath163 . we also found other solutions with the apsides librating about centers different from @xmath160 .",
    "the 1e:1b  mmr island has a very complex dynamical structure , particularly in the vicinity of the best fit .",
    "direct integrations show that weakly chaotic solutions in that zone may lead to a sudden collision of planets after hundreds myr of apparently stable orbital behavior .",
    "let us note that to refine the stable fit , the megno was integrated over @xmath164 .",
    "still , there is an open question whether the fit quality should be the final argument to rule out the 1b:1e  mmr configurations .",
    "we think that the problem deserves a further study .",
    "let us recall that we searched only for coplanar solutions .",
    "the stability may be easily preserved for inclined configurations @xcite . yet",
    "the system architecture involving planets b and  e in the 1:1  mmr may still permit the existence of other bodies besides the well established planet  c.",
    "the long - term radial velocity surveys of the sun - like stars constantly reveal more and more exciting features of the planetary systems",
    ". the @xmath0  ara system may be the second known four - planet configuration , after 55  cnc @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in such a multi - planet system the orbits are close to circular ones , similarly to three - planet systems of hd  37124 @xcite and hd  68930 @xcite resembling the solar system architecture .",
    "the alternative best - fit three - planet configurations may contain two jupiter - like planets in the 4:1  mmr . in that case , the eccentric orbits ( @xmath165 would be localized in a dynamically active region of the phase space ; in fact , on the edge of dynamical stability . besides the worse fit quality , it could be a heuristic argument against the three - planet system . obviously , the key for the proper understanding of the orbital architecture is the improved precision of observations and their extended time span .",
    "curiously , the new data reveal a jovian planet that has the orbital period two times shorter than the companion already detected a few years ago .",
    "it remains an open question whether the two inner companions ( the planets b and  e ) in the four - planet configuration are locked in the 2:1  mmr .",
    "most likely , the presence of the massive companion  c prevents the creation of the 2:1  mmrs island known in the other four extrasolar systems ( gliese  876 , hd  82943 , hd",
    "128311 , and hd  73526 ) presumably locked in this resonance . in any case , even the proximity of their orbits to such particular dynamical state can be counted as the fifth occurrence of the 2:1  mmr among @xmath166 multi - planet systems known up to date .",
    "it may indicate a universal dynamical mechanism governing the creation and orbital evolution of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "we also found stable configurations related to the 1:1  mmr of the inner jovian planets in eccentric orbits .",
    "however , such fits are significantly worse than those derived for the system with quasi - circular orbits .",
    "the results of our analysis permit us to conclude that a few years of observations are still required to constrain the outermost orbit without a doubt .",
    "looking at the orbits of the @xmath0  ara planets and recalling the results of @xcite , we see a free space in the range of @xmath167  au in which new planetary objects may yet exist .",
