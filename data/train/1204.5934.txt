    "for this reason , iron chalcogenides are generally considered an ideal candidate for understanding some open issues of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "one of the most intriguing phenomena observed in the study of the vortex properties in type - ii superconductors is the so called peak ( or fishtail ) effect .",
    "a second peak in the magnetization curve @xmath7(@xmath8 ) of low-@xmath9 superconductors has been observed as early as in the sixties@xcite and a first theoretical explanation has been suggested by pippard in 1969.@xcite the peak has been found in proximity of @xmath10 in nb@xmath5sn , @xcite ceru@xmath4 , @xcite nbse@xmath4 , @xcite v@xmath5si@xcite and mgb@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite + the peak effect has been clearly observed also in the cuprate superconductors but its features vary from one compound to the other . in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 crystals ,",

    "@xcite however , significant differences in the second - peak features have been observed within this family : in the highly anisotropic bi-2212 and bi-2223 the peak is sharp and temperature independent @xcite while in bi-2201 crystals it exhibits a strong temperature dependence . @xcite regarding the iron - based superconductors ,",
    "the peak effect has been observed in feas-1111 , @xcite in feas-122 @xcite and in fete@xmath14se@xmath15,@xcite even if a clear understanding of the physical origin of the phenomenon in this family has not been achieved , yet .",
    "however , since it has been shown by small angle neutron scattering,@xcite bitter decoration@xcite and magnetic force microscopy@xcite that an ordered vortex lattice is not present in these compounds , the origin of the peak effect due to a phase transition of the vortex lattice seems to be excluded .    beyond the investigation of the magnetization curves ,",
    "an useful approach for investigating the vortex dynamics is the study of the relaxation processes of the magnetization .",
    "the critical state of the vortex lattice , which determines the hysteresis of the magnetization in type - ii superconductors , is a metastable state .",
    "it follows that vortices tend to hop out of their pinning - potential well in order to reach the configuration of absolute minimum energy .",
    "such motion usually arises from thermal activation , but it can also arise from quantum tunneling ( at low temperatures ) or can be stimulated by external perturbations , such as microwave shaking of the vortex lattice .",
    "@xcite magnetic relaxation processes have been observed in various low - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite however , the subject has become of even greater interest after the discovery of high-@xmath9 superconductors , because of the higher operating temperatures and of the small activation energies related to the short coherence length and large anisotropy .",
    "the concept of thermally - induced hopping of the flux lines has been first treated by anderson and kim .",
    "@xcite in the framework of their model a logarithmic dependence of the magnetization ( @xmath7 ) on the time ( @xmath16 ) is expected .",
    "this behavior has been verified in various superconductors , both low @xmath9 and high @xmath9 ; however , in many experiments , deviations from the logarithmic dependence of @xmath7 have been observed , indicating a failure of the approximations that bring this expectation .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the collective pinning theory a more complex expression for the dependence of the potential energy barrier height ( the so - called interpolation formula ) is proposed : @xmath17 $ ] where @xmath18 is a parameter varying as a function of the vortex - vortex and vortex - pinning center interaction .",
    "@xcite for example , in three dimensional systems @xmath19 when the creep is dominated by the motion of individual flux lines , @xmath20 in the case of collective creep of small bundles and @xmath21 when the bundle size is much larger than the larkin correlated volume  @xcite . in 1991 ,",

    "we have found that the pairs of values ( @xmath58 , @xmath183 ) that identify the second - peak position in the @xmath30 curves obtained at different temperatures and different relaxation times reconstruct a unique curve .",

    "<S> an extensive study of the magnetic properties of fete@xmath0se@xmath1 crystals in the superconducting state is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we show that weak collective pinning , originating from spatial variations of the charge carrier mean free path ( @xmath2 pinning ) , rules in this superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compatible with the nanoscale phase separation observed on this compound and indicate that in spite of the chemical inhomogeneity spatial fluctuations of the critical temperature are not important for pinning . </S>",
    "<S> a power law dependence of the magnetization vs time , generally interpreted as signature of single vortex creep regime , is observed in magnetic fields up to 8  t. for magnetic fields applied along the @xmath3 axis of the crystal the magnetization curves exhibit a clear peak effect whose position shifts when varying the temperature , following the same dependence as observed in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the time and temperature dependence of the peak position has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the occurrence of the peak at a given magnetic field determines a specific vortex configuration that is independent on the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that the influence of the temperature on the vortex - vortex and vortex - defect interactions leading to the peak effect in fete@xmath0se@xmath1 is negligible in the explored range of temperatures . </S>"
