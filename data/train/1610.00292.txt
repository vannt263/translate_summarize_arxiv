    "one of the most important parts of the mathematical theory of the trajectories of ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) , which will be also of great importance in the present paper , is connected with the detailed description of the stable open trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) .",
    "let us say here that the most important breakthroughs in this problem were made in papers @xcite where rather deep topological theorems about non - closed trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) were proved .    using the topological description of the stable open trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) it was possible to introduce important topological characteristics of the stable nontrivial regimes of the magneto - conductivity behavior in the limit @xmath42 , which were introduced in paper @xcite . in general",

    "let us note here that the statement ( 1 ) was first formulated by s.p .",
    "novikov in the form of a conjecture , which was proved later for the stable open trajectories of ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , the integral planes @xmath60 represent experimentally observable objects view the remarkable geometric properties of the open stable trajectories , described above .",

    "the behavior of the conductivity tensor in the presence of the chaotic trajectories constructed in @xcite was investigated in @xcite and appeared to be rather different from both the regimes given by ( [ 3dimclosedtr ] ) and ( [ 3dimperiodictr ] ) .",
    "the most interesting feature of the contribution to the conductivity tensor of the trajectories of this kind is that the presence of such trajectories suppresses the conductivity in all directions , including the direction of @xmath4 , in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "in general , the tsarev and dynnikov chaotic trajectories demonstrate two different general types of possible chaotic behavior of trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) , so in this sense all chaotic trajectories of ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) can be attributed to the tsarev or dynnikov type .",
    "let us say here that different properties of chaotic trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) are also intensively investigated in modern mathematical literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the directions of @xmath22 , corresponding to the chaotic open trajectories , can appear only outside the `` stability zones '' , corresponding to the stable open trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) . in the same way , the chaotic open trajectories of different types ( tsarev or dynnikov type ) can not appear at the same direction of @xmath20 .",
    "let us say , however , that in general the contribution of non - closed trajectories to the conductivity tensor should be added with the contribution ( [ 3dimclosedtr ] ) of closed trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) , which usually present together with open trajectories ( of any kind ) at the same fermi surface",

    "[ schemfermisurf ] ) . it is assumed that all the planes are divided into the `` even - numbered '' and the `` odd - numbered '' planes , which gives also the separation of the cylinders into two different classes .",
    "we will assume here , that all the planes of a given class represent the same object after the factorization over the reciprocal lattice vectors and the same is assumed also about the cylinders of a given class .",
    "thus , the physical fermi - surface represents here two parallel two - dimensional tori ( with holes ) @xmath234 connected by two cylinders in @xmath207 .    .",
    "]    it is easy to see that for those @xmath4 , which are almost parallel to the axes of the cylinders , the cylinders constructed above represent cylinders of closed electron trajectories , while the planes with holes play the role of carriers of open trajectories .",
    "it can be seen also , that the open trajectories on the planes of different types represent the motion in two opposite directions , while two types of finite - sized cylinders carry closed trajectories of the `` electron type '' and the `` hole type '' respectively .",
    "thus , we get a stability zone @xmath75 around the direction @xmath484 , parallel to the axes of the cylinders connecting the integral planes",
    ".    the cylinders of the closed trajectories almost coincide with the cylinders , connecting the planes , for directions of @xmath4 , close to @xmath485 , however , they become shorter and represent just parts of these cylinders for @xmath4 , deviating from the direction @xmath485 . the boundary of the zone @xmath75 is defined by the condition that the height of the cylinders of closed trajectories of one type ( say , electron type ) becomes zero , while the height of the cylinders of closed trajectories of another type remains finite . after crossing the boundary of @xmath75 the individual integral planes do not represent carriers of open trajectories anymore , however , we can still claim that near the boundary of @xmath75 the cylinders of closed trajectories of the second type cut our fermi - surface into pairs of connected integral planes in @xmath486 .",
    "so , we can investigate here the behavior of trajectories of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) separately on these separated parts of the fermi - surface , which gives actually rather simple description of the trajectories in @xmath486 :    let us denote here by @xmath60 the integral plane , giving the common integral direction of the planes considered above , and by @xmath487 the plane orthogonal to @xmath4 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that in the picture described above all the trajectories on our fermi - surface become closed if the intersection of @xmath60 and @xmath487 has irrational direction .",
    "the appearance of the closed trajectories on every pair of connected planes can be considered as a result of a reconstruction of the open trajectories , which is caused by the `` jumps '' of the trajectories between two planes outside @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ reconstrtraject ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that these closed trajectories will have very big length in the immediate vicinity of the boundary of @xmath75 due to the low probability of the `` jumps '' in this region . at the same time",
    ", it can be seen also that for any fixed irrational direction of intersection of @xmath60 and @xmath487 all the open trajectories will necessarily pass through the reconstruction after the crossing the boundary of @xmath108 .     on the angle diagram . ]",
    "the situation is rather different when the intersection of @xmath60 and @xmath487 has a rational direction @xmath104 . in this case",
    "just a part of open trajectories undergoes reconstruction after the crossing the boundary of @xmath75 by the direction of the magnetic field , while the other trajectories still remain open .",
    "so , in this situation the long and the open periodic trajectories coexist on the integral planes , having different measure for different directions of @xmath4 .",
    "it is not difficult to see also , that the open trajectories have the maximal measure near the boundary of @xmath75 and disappear at the endpoints of the curve @xmath488 .    from a simple estimation of the integrals in ( [ gensigmakl ] ) we easily get that in the interval @xmath489 the contribution of the long closed trajectories to",
    "the conductivity is similar to that of the stable open trajectories , so we get formula ( [ sigmalowbtau ] ) in this interval .    to estimate the contribution of the trajectories shown at fig .",
    "[ reconstrtraject ] in the limit @xmath490 let us just first note that we have in general the relations @xmath491 for this type of trajectories .",
    "at the same time , we can see that the trajectory shown at fig .",
    "[ reconstrtraject ] can be considered as consisting of two parts belonging to different former carriers of open trajectories with opposite values of @xmath492 and @xmath493 . as a result ,",
    "the typical value of @xmath494 on the closed trajectories is rather small and is defined by the density of the trajectory on the ( former ) carriers in the brillouen zone .",
    "the exact dependence of @xmath495 on the value @xmath163 can have in fact a complicated character , it s not difficult to see , however , that for our pretty rough definition of the function @xmath163 the simple approximation @xmath496 can be used .",
    "it can be seen also that with the same accuracy we can also use the approximations @xmath497 for large but finite values of @xmath80 . at the same time , for the values @xmath498 we can use the relation @xmath499 for all @xmath500 . using the above relations , we then easily get from ( [ symmetricpart ] ) the following estimations @xmath501 for the contribution of the long closed trajectories to the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor .",
    "let us note also here that the integration over a set of carriers of open trajectories @xmath502 in formula ( [ symmetricpart ] ) should be understood now as the integration over the part of the fermi surface @xmath503 occupied by the long closed trajectories .",
    "let us remind now , that the tensor @xmath504 should be added also with the symmetric part of the short closed trajectories extracted from the relations ( [ sigmaregexpclosed ] ) . as a result",
    ", the value @xmath505 will get in fact a finite contribution , which does not depend on the value of @xmath163 .",
    "we can claim , however , that the conductivity behavior demonstrates here a partial suppression of the conductivity along the direction of @xmath22 , which is expressed by the formula ( [ sigmaprime33 ] ) .",
    "to evaluate the contribution of the long closed trajectories to the anti - symmetric part of the conductivity tensor we need actually a more detailed consideration of the behavior of @xmath506 on the trajectories of this type .",
    "thus , using formula ( [ antisympart ] ) in the form @xmath507 we can easily get the estimation @xmath508 from the relation ( [ vxlctest ] ) .",
    "at the same time , the estimation of the value @xmath509 requires in fact a more detailed analysis of the formula ( [ lctansympart ] ) .",
    "thus , the estimations ( [ vyzlctest ] ) can not be simply used in formula ( [ lctansympart ] ) to get the corresponding estimation of @xmath509 because of the specific form of the trajectories shown at fig .",
    "[ reconstrtraject ] . indeed , as can be easily seen , the values @xmath510 and @xmath511 on the trajectories of this form are strongly correlated on big scales @xmath512 , so , their slow harmonics will in fact annihilate each other in the anti - symmetric part of @xmath56 .",
    "more precisely , let us represent the values @xmath506 on the long closed trajectories in the form @xmath513 @xmath514 where @xmath515    it is not difficult to check then by direct calculation that the contribution of the long closed trajectories to the anti - symmetric part of the conductivity tensor can be written as @xmath516 where the integration over @xmath222 is taken along the heights of the cylinders of long closed trajectories .",
    "let us note here that the net height of all non - equivalent cylinders of the long closed trajectories has the order of @xmath517 while the density of the frequencies @xmath518 is proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "the correlation of the functions @xmath519 and @xmath520 on the trajectory means now that the coefficients @xmath521 and @xmath522 are phase correlated , i.e. have almost the same complex phases at small values of @xmath523 . in general , we can use the estimation @xmath524 in the interval @xmath525    at the same time , we can write for the same values of @xmath523 the relations @xmath526 for the trajectories of our type .    as a result , we can write approximately @xmath527 in the interval @xmath528 .    using the above estimations in the formula ( [ antisymmfourie ] ) we can get now the regular expansion for the value @xmath509 in the region @xmath490 , having the form @xmath529 where all @xmath530 have the order of @xmath531 . in particular , we can write in the main order @xmath532    finally , we can write the estimation @xmath533 for the contribution of the long closed trajectories to the anti - symmetric part of the conductivity tensor .    easy to see also that after the addition of the contribution of the short closed trajectories we get finally the formula ( [ sigmahighbtauantisym ] ) for the anti - symmetric part of the conductivity tensor .",
    "for the values @xmath534 formula ( [ gensigmakl ] ) gives some intermediate regimes between ( [ sigmalowbtau ] ) and ( [ sigmahighbtausymm ] ) - ( [ sigmahighbtauantisym ] ) which have in general some irregular form .",
    "we do nt consider here these regimes in detail and just speak of the experimental approach to description of @xmath56 using intermediate powers of @xmath535 .",
    "as we have already said , the corresponding powers of @xmath55 have in this case just a local character and are not well defined as stable characteristics of the conductivity behavior .    the schematic fermi - surface considered above looks rather special from the general point of view .",
    "however , it demonstrates all the main points of the behavior of open trajectories near the boundary of the stability zone @xmath75 which are important for us .",
    "in general , the schematic picture represented above can be enriched by additional cylinders of closed trajectories , connecting the integral planes or just having a point as a cylinder base ( fig .",
    "[ enrichedschemsurf ] ) .",
    "still , the main features of the reconstruction of the carriers of open trajectories after crossing the boundary of @xmath75 for generic dispersion relation and the fermi level @xmath23 is given by the vanishing of the height of one particular cylinder of open trajectories and the division of the fermi - surface into the pairs of integral planes separated by other cylinders of closed trajectories .",
    "the most general picture of the division of the fermi - surface for @xmath536 is given actually by the scheme containing more than two non - equivalent integral planes ( with the same integral direction ) , connected by cylinders of closed trajectories . in the last situation , which is theoretically possible for fermi - surfaces of very high genus , the pairs of integral planes and individual carriers of open trajectories can coexist after the reconstruction of a part of the open trajectories . mathematically we will have in this case an overlapping of two stability zones @xmath75 and @xmath537 with the same `` topological quantum numbers '' , which will result also in overlapping of the zones @xmath78 and @xmath538 in the experimental study of conductivity .",
    "the full conductivity tensor in the overlappings @xmath539 is given in this case by the sum of the corresponding asymptotic expressions above , so we have here a theoretical possibility to observe very complicated analytical behavior of conductivity in the limit @xmath410 .     belonging to a fixed stability zone @xmath108 . ]",
    "let us point out here that the possibility of representation of the fermi - surface in the special form described above in the case of presence of stable open trajectories is based on rather deep topological theorems playing the most important role in the considerations of papers @xcite .",
    "so , the picture described above represents in fact ( under some generic requirements ) the most general situation .    at the same time",
    ", we have to note that the statement above should be understood just as a topological characterization of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) in the case of presence of stable open trajectories .",
    "thus , the topological structure shown at fig . [ enrichedschemsurf ] can have in fact much more complicated ( visual ) geometric representation in the @xmath208 - space .",
    "finally , we can briefly describe the structure of the `` experimentally observable stability zone '' @xmath540 , arising in the quasiclassical approximation , as a union of the following main parts :    \\i ) the central part of the zone @xmath78 ( containing the `` mathematical stability zone '' @xmath108 ) .",
    "the conductivity behavior in this part demonstrates the `` most regular '' dependence on the value of @xmath80 , represented by the asymptotic regimes ( [ sigmaomega ] ) or ( [ sigmalowbtau ] ) . at the same time",
    ", the angular dependence of @xmath188 demonstrates here rather irregular character due to the presence of the `` rational peaks '' in the values of @xmath188 on a dense set of directions of @xmath22 in this area ( fig .",
    "[ complbehaviorzone ] ) .",
    "\\ii ) the zone of rather complicated form around the central part of the zone @xmath78 ( the black area at fig .",
    "[ complbehaviorzone ] ) .",
    "the tensor @xmath188 demonstrates here the most complicated dependence both on the value and the direction of @xmath22 , corresponding to a gradual transition from the regime ( [ sigmalowbtau ] ) to ( [ sigmahighbtausymm ] ) - ( [ sigmahighbtauantisym ] ) . for an approximation of the behavior of @xmath188",
    "the intermediate powers @xmath479 can be locally used , in general the value of @xmath195 demonstrates unstable behavior . at the same time , the behavior of @xmath188 demonstrates a suppression of the conductivity along the direction of @xmath22 ( @xmath541 ) to some lower values on the exterior boundary of this zone .",
    "\\iii ) the `` boundary region '' of the zone @xmath78 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath188 demonstrates here a gradual transition from the regime ( [ sigmahighbtausymm ] ) - ( [ sigmahighbtauantisym ] ) to the simpler behavior ( [ 3dimclosedtr ] ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath542 demonstrates here a gradual increasing of the conductivity along the direction of @xmath22 to its maximal value on the boundary of @xmath78 .    at the end of the paper",
    ", we would like to make also one additional substantial remark .",
    "namely , it can be actually shown , that the topological structure of system ( [ quasiclassicalevolution ] ) admits also a similar description being considered for the whole dispersion relation @xmath5 and not just for a fixed fermi level @xmath204 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the `` stability zones '' ( corresponding to the presence of stable open trajectories at least at one energy level ) can be introduced for the whole spectrum @xmath5 . from this point of view , the `` experimentally observable stability zones '' @xmath78 have in fact a connection with exact mathematical stability zones , defined for the whole energy spectrum . in particular",
    ", every `` experimentally observable stability zone '' @xmath78 always belongs to a bigger mathematical stability zone @xmath537 , defined for the whole spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "we investigate the analytical behavior of conductivity of normal metals in strong magnetic fields in the case of presence of stable open electron trajectories on the fermi surface .",
    "as it is shown in the paper , the behavior of conductivity can demonstrate rather nontrivial analytical properties in `` experimentally observable stability zones '' even under the condition @xmath79 .",
