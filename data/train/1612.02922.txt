    "the dusty torus around active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is a key component in a unification theory of agns ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "such torus is originally introduced to hide broad line region , another key component in the unification theory , from observers line - of - sight for type-2 agns in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths . in the unification theory ,",
    "the torus is also responsible for major characteristics of agns at x - ray and mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths .",
    "x - ray emission , especially in the soft x - ray band , from the central part of the agn is absorbed by gas within the torus .",
    "the observed absorption is larger for type-2 agns due to the dusty torus intercepting along the line - of - sight , and most x - ray emission below 10  kev is absorbed in the extreme compton - thick case ( @xmath5  @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the hydrogen column density ) .",
    "mir emission from the agn is dominated by thermal emission of the dusty torus heated by the agn .",
    "silicate feature around 9.7  @xmath2 m is often seen either in absorption or emission when the torus is seen edge - on or pole - on , respectively , by the observers .",
    "recent mir studies have provided us with much more realistic view of the central part of the agns .",
    "_ spitzer _ studies of nearby compton - thick agns have shown that even compton - thick agns , especially low - luminosity ones , often show only modest  moderate silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath8 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "classical smooth torus model , such as one of @xcite , predicts deeper absorption in proportion to the x - ray absorption column density . on the other hand ,",
    "if the torus is made of collection of clouds , each cloud is heated to @xmath9  k to emit mir emission while absorbing the background light when the foreground cloud is cooler than the one behind .",
    "the radiation transfer effect among the clouds significantly reduces the net silicate absorption even when the torus is seen edge - on @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , recent mir interferometric studies of nearby agns have started to directly reveal the dust distribution in the vicinity of the agns at parsec scales . in some best studied agns ,",
    "extended optically - thin dust emission elongated toward the system s polar direction ( e.g. , direction of the extended narrow line region or outflow ) is typically found in addition to the compact disk - like component ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite for the single dish study ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "such extended polar emission is clearly inconsistent with the classical idea of the dusty torus in the unification theory , and its nature is under debate .",
    "some proposed ideas are that it originates from the inner funnel of an extended dust distribution above and below the torus and/or the dusty outflow within the ionizing cone that is radiatively driven from the inner wall of the compact dusty torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "m51 ( ngc  5194 ) is a very nearby ( 7.1  mpc ; @xcite ; @xmath10 corresponds to 34.4  pc ) compton - thick agn .",
    "it is one of the nearest agns , and is even closer than the best studied compton - thick agn ngc  1068 ( 14.4  mpc ) .",
    "although the agn in m51 ( 0.07  jy for the unresolved core component at a resolution of 04 full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at 11.2  @xmath2 m ;  [ radial_profile_analysis ] ) is much fainter than that of ngc  1068 ( 8.7  jy within a central 04 aperture at 11.6  @xmath2 m ; @xcite ) , it has been studied in great detail , thanks to its proximity . the hard x - ray emission from the agn",
    "was discovered by _ ginga _",
    "@xcite , and its compton - thick spectra have been analyzed in more detail by using the succeeding x - ray satellites @xcite .",
    "extended agn - related activities such as radio jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , optical narrow line region nebula ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and soft x - ray nebula @xcite have been known .",
    "torus - like structures at @xmath11  pc scale have been claimed in the 1990s by several authors , although they are not likely the torus in light of recent advanced high - resolution infrared interferometric studies of nearby agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "those include disk - like rotating dense molecular gas cloud at @xmath11  pc scale with hcn ( @xmath12 ) emission @xcite and `` x''-shaped nuclear dust lanes at several tens  pc scale in _ hst _ optical images @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that most molecular gas is associated with circumnuclear outflowing structures at several tens  pc scale , with little nuclear concentration .",
    "they argued that the hydrogen column density toward the nucleus is apparently much smaller ( by more than two orders of magnitude ) than the expectation from the compton - thick x - ray properties ( see also @xcite ;  [ discussion_torus ] ) .",
    "high spatial - resolution mir imaging of one of the nearest agns in m51 would enable us to examine details of the agn structure and its circumnuclear region .",
    "in the @xmath1-band ( 813  @xmath2 m ) , ground - based 810  m telescopes can achieve diffraction - limited resolution of 0304 , or @xmath13  pc at a distance of m51 .",
    "note that the most powerful high - resolution imaging / spectral mapping machine at mir , very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) with midi ( mid - infrared interferometric ) instrument , can not observe this galaxy due to its declination .",
    "in addition , space - based mir imaging and spectroscopy provide the best sensitivity over the larger field of view and larger wavelength coverage at modest spatial resolution , enabling detailed spectral analysis of the agn and its circumnuclear region . therefore , we performed subaru mir imaging observation and analyzed the archival _",
    "data of the agn in m51 to characterize the agn inner structure and effect of the agn on the circumnuclear region .",
    "imaging observation in the @xmath1-band was made with comics @xcite at the subaru telescope on a night of april 20 , 2011 ( utc ) .",
    "we employed four filters , two medium - band continuum filters : `` n8.8 '' ( @xmath14  @xmath2 m ; @xmath15  @xmath2 m ) and `` n10.5 '' ( @xmath16  @xmath2 m ; @xmath17  @xmath2 m ) , and two narrow - band filters for spectral features : `` uir11.2 '' ( @xmath18  @xmath2 m ; @xmath19  @xmath2 m ) and `` [ ne  ii ] '' ( @xmath20  @xmath2 m ; @xmath21  @xmath2 m ) , covering most of the entire @xmath1-band window altogether .",
    "one pixel corresponds to 013 on the sky .",
    "the observation was made in a standard procedure for ground - based mir observations with secondary mirror chopping .",
    "we chopped between the nucleus and `` sky '' region at a frequency of about 0.5  hz , while keeping the m51 nucleus on - chip at both positions ( figure  [ findingchart ] ) .",
    "the sky is 10  off the nucleus toward pa@xmath22 , and is not a true background sky .",
    "it is rather located at relatively smooth region within m51 between the nucleus and the most inner star - forming ring .",
    "while the secondary mirror stays at one chop position for over @xmath23 second , the detector array is read out multiple times , and the instrument computer stacks them over that period to create a frame , which is a unit for us to process off - line .",
    "when the secondary mirror was chopped toward the nucleus position , the telescope was guided with an independent offset guiding system by using a nearby bright star .",
    "we employed the same chopping pattern both for m51 and photometric standard stars , and we measured the chop distance by using the standard star observations .",
    "we did not employ frequent telescope nodding , because this chopping method alone gives relatively flat `` background '' region when subtracting frames between the two chopping positions .",
    "note that we detected only a compact nucleus at a scale of about one arcsec with all filters , and everywhere else can be considered effectively as background (  [ radial_profile_analysis ] ) .",
    "however , we nodded the telescope at much longer timescale of @xmath24 minutes .",
    "this is to reduce effect of bad pixels and pixel - dependent calibration errors in the final stacked images .",
    "we measured the nod distance by using partly stacked images of the m51 nucleus itself taken at the same telescope nod positions .",
    "flux calibration and monitoring of the photometric / seeing conditions were made based on photometric standard star observations .",
    "we choose hd107274 from @xcite since it is closest to m51 ( @xmath25 away ) .",
    "we also observed hd120993 , the second closest star in the list , when hd107274 went below the telescope elevation of @xmath26 .",
    "their in - band fluxes are summarized in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "the standard stars were observed immediately before or after ( or both ) each observing session of about 12 hours , during which m51 had been observed continuously with one filter , by using the same filter and the detector readout pattern for the m51 observation .",
    "we measured variation of standard star count rates during the night , and found no significant change ( @xmath27% in the [ ne  ii ] image and less in the other band images ) during the night .",
    "we also measured seeing variation during the night by using the standard star observations , and found no significant change of the fwhm size of the stars .",

    "this includes subtraction of chop - paired frames , flat fielding , image shifting for the secondary - mirror chopping and telescope nodding , and stacking .",
    "we also checked photometric conditions of all individual frames , by measuring the total flux ( before subtracting the chop - paired frames ) and pixel - to - pixel flux variation ( after subtracting the chop - paired frames and flat - fielding ) in the background region away from the m51 nucleus .",
    "both quantities rapidly increase when cloud passes the telescope beam .",
    "we removed a small fraction ( @xmath32% for the uir11.2 image and less for other filter images ) of frames taken under poor sky conditions before stacking .",

    "no other notable structures such as elongated disks or extended arms are detected .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) is carefully characterized with standard star images . because the psf was stable during the night (  [ observations ] ) , we stacked standard star images for each filter to derive the psf radial profile ( top row of figure  [ radialfit_results ] ) .",
    "note that , in order to avoid difficulties in handling non - axisymmetric psfs , our analysis of the source structure and photometries are entirely based on the azimuthally - averaged radial brightness profiles ( hereafter , the radial profiles ) of the standard star and m51 images after simply stacking the frames without considering the psf rotation .",
    "we found that n10.5 , uir11.2 , and [ ne  ii ] images are almost diffraction - limited , while the resolution of the n8.8 image is worse ( table  [ obslog ] ) . for the n8.8 and n10.5 images , we smoothed both standard star and m51 images in the same way to improve the signal - to - noise ratio by convolving a gaussian kernel of 1.5 pixel ( or 019 ) fwhm .",

    "note that the fwhms of the single gaussian model are consistent with previous measurements by @xcite under poor sky conditions with michelle instrument at gemini north telescope at the similar wavelengths .",
    "we then fit the m51 nucleus radial profile with double ( core+halo ) component models . in the n10.5 , uir11.2 , and [ ne  ii ] images",
    ", we found that both double gaussian and psf+gaussian models are much better than the single component models in terms of both smaller reduced @xmath34 ( @xmath23 ) and little fit residual patterns . in the double gaussian model ,",
    "widths of the compact gaussian component ( 0304 fwhm ) are roughly comparable to those of the psfs , supporting an idea of presence of an unresolved core at the nucleus .",
    "such unresolved core is naturally expected for this agn .",
    "therefore , we prefer a model of psf+gaussian for the three filter images . to estimate the upper limit of the intrinsic core size corrected for the instrumental effect , we assumed that the core intrinsically shows a gaussian profile and the observed core is actually a gaussian - smoothed psf .",
    "we fit the uir11.2 and [ ne  ii ] images with the gaussian - smoothed psf for the core and the best - fit gaussian component for the extended component , and measured @xmath34 values for various gaussian core sizes .",
    "we found that the one sigma upper limit of the core size ( fwhm ) is 8  pc and 6  pc in uir11.2 and [ ne  ii ] images , respectively .",
    "we adopt 6  pc as the best estimate of the intrinsic core size upper limit . as for the n8.8 image ,",
    "the single gaussian model is as good as the double component models , and the single gaussian fit indicates that this component is extended .",
    "we thereby suspect that the n8.8 image is also made of an unresolved core+halo structure as in the case of other filter images , although we can not confirm presence of the core component in this band .",
    "we use the profile fitting results with the psf+gaussian model to do photometry of each core and halo component of the m51 nucleus in all four filter images ( table  [ table_radialfit_results ] ) .",
    "figure  [ sed ] shows the resultant seds of the m51 nucleus .",
    "the core+halo sed is rather flat with slightly increasing flux at longer wavelength .",
    "flux ratios between the core and halo are about 0.3 in all filters , implying that each of the core and halo seds shows the similar flat sed .",
    "we compare the comics core+halo photometries with the previous measurements by @xcite .",
    "they used michelle instrument at the gemini north telescope , and employed two medium - band `` silicate '' filters : `` si-5 '' ( @xmath64  @xmath2 m ; @xmath65  @xmath2 m ) and `` si-6 '' ( @xmath66  @xmath2 m ; @xmath67  @xmath2 m ) . note that the si-6 filter includes [ ne  ii ] but its width ( 1.2  @xmath2 m ) is much wider than the [ ne  ii ] filter of comics ( 0.21  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "because of poor seeing , they simply reported that the nucleus could be marginally resolved .",
    "we compare our core+halo photometries with their single gaussian fitting photometries ( top and middle panels of figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "this is because they claimed that their psf - fitting photometry is not reliable under poor seeing conditions but the gaussian fitting photometry is reliable to measure the total flux from the nuclear region .",
    "we found that the comics uir11.2 ( 11.2  @xmath2 m ) flux is consistent with the michelle si-5 ( 11.6  @xmath2 m ) flux , whereas the comics [ ne  ii ] ( 12.8  @xmath2 m ) flux is notably higher than the michelle si-6 ( 12.5  @xmath2 m ) flux .",
    "we examine this difference in combination with the _ spitzer _ data in  [ results_core_halo ] below .",
    "m51 was observed by _",
    "spitzer _ as a part of the sings survey @xcite , and a number of papers were already published for this galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we retrieved both ch3 ( 5.8  @xmath2 m ) and ch4 ( 8.0  @xmath2 m ) irac @xcite mosaic images , and sl1 and sl2 ( covering @xmath68  @xmath2 m in total ) irs @xcite spectral cubes ( reconstructed from slit - scanning data ) from the sings dr2 data distribution .",
    "we aligned both sl1 and sl2 cubes to form a single cube for our study .",
    "both ch3 and ch4 images trace hot dust continuum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a compact ( but slightly resolved ) nucleus and surrounding ring / spiral - arm structures are evidently seen at a few tens arcsec scale in these bands ( figure  [ findingchart ] ) .",
    "they show a clear contrast to both irac ch1 ( 3.6  @xmath2 m ) and ch2 ( 4.5  @xmath2 m ) images , which trace the stellar distribution showing an extended bulge structure around the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the irs cubes also show similar structures as seen in the irac images , but the nucleus is not spatially resolved with irs ( see @xcite for full details ) .    to enable direct comparison between the irs spectra and the comics photometries , we extracted irs spectra from the cubes both on the nucleus and at the off - nucleus `` sky '' region of the comics chopping observation (  [ observations ] ; top panel of figure  [ sed ] )",
    ". aperture size of each region is @xmath69 pixels of the irs cube ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this size is large enough to include most of the flux from the unresolved irs nucleus , but it is much larger than typical scale of the nucleus seen with comics (  [ radial_profile_analysis ] ) .",
    "these spectra are very similar to those presented by @xcite ( their figure 3 ) , although their spectra are extracted with slightly different extraction box size ( @xmath71 ) and their off - nuclear spectrum is extracted at the different location .",
    "a `` chopped '' nuclear irs spectrum was also made by subtracting the `` sky '' spectrum from the nuclear one ( middle panel of figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "synthetic photometries on these three irs spectra for the comics filters are made to compare with the comics photometries .",
    "the nuclear and off - nuclear irs spectra show numbers of differences ( top panel of figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "the off - nuclear spectrum is similar to that of typical star - forming region ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as originally proven by @xcite , the nuclear spectrum shows stronger [ ne  ii]@xmath72  @xmath2 m , [ ne  v]@xmath73  @xmath2 m , [ s  iv]@xmath74  @xmath2 m , and pure - rotational h@xmath75 lines ( @xmath76 @xmath77(5 ) at 6.91  @xmath2 m , @xmath76 @xmath77(4 ) at 9.03  @xmath2 m , @xmath76 @xmath77(3 ) at 9.67  @xmath2 m , and @xmath76 @xmath77(2 ) at 12.28  @xmath2 m ) , with weaker pah 6.2  @xmath2 m and 7.7  @xmath2 m features ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the chopped nuclear irs spectrum is quite different from both nuclear and off - nuclear spectra ( middle panel of figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "it is flat - continuum dominated with little pah features , and shows only fine structure lines such as [ ne  ii ] , [ ne  v ] , and pure - rotational h@xmath78 lines .",
    "we found that the [ ne  ii]/[ne  v ] flux ratio is about 4 .",
    "the irac ch4/ch3 flux ratio image shows a trend within a few tens arcsec from the nucleus , in a sense that the ratio is smallest at the nucleus and it gradually becomes larger with increasing radius from the nucleus ( figure  [ findingchart ] ) . beyond this radius",
    ", the ratio image shows structures such as a circumnuclear ring and inner arms , where the ratio is relatively enhanced .",
    "because the nuclear irs spectrum shows weaker pah 7.7  @xmath2 m feature ( top panel of figure  [ sed ] ) , which is usually prominent in the ch4 band in star - forming regions , the smaller ch4/ch3 flux ratio around the nucleus is likely due to weaker pah features .",
    "the comics core+halo sed of the m51 nucleus is quite different from typical sed of star - forming objects and the irs off - nuclear spectrum of m51 ( top panel of figure  [ sed ] ) , and is instead consistent with the chopped nuclear irs spectrum showing little pah features ( middle panel of figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "when compared to the michelle photometries of the m51 nucleus @xcite , the comics uir11.2 ( 11.2  @xmath2 m ) flux is consistent with the michelle si-5 ( 11.6  @xmath2 m ) flux , whereas the comics [ ne  ii ] ( 12.8  @xmath2 m ) flux is notably higher than the michelle si-6 ( 12.5  @xmath2 m ) flux (  [ comp_michelle ] ) . in an attempt to explain the difference",
    ", we made the synthetic photometries of the chopped nuclear irs spectrum for the two michelle filters ( top and middle panels of figure  [ sed ] ) .",
    "we found that the comics [ ne  ii ] flux is larger than the si-6 flux because the [ ne  ii ] filter just covers the [ ne  ii ] line whereas the si-6 filter also covers the adjacent continuum due to its wider filter width .",
    "therefore , both comics core+halo and michelle photometries are consistent with the chopped nuclear irs spectrum after considering difference in the filter widths .",
    "the _ spitzer _ and ground - based photometries match to each other despite of their different spatial resolutions , suggesting that a single compact core+halo component is located at the nucleus over the extended host - galaxy component showing the typical pah features .",
    "the relatively weaker pah feature strength in the nuclear irs spectrum ( top panel of figure  [ sed ] ; @xcite ) is apparently due to this core+halo component showing little pah features .",
    "the comics core sed can be interpreted as either the pah - deficient chopped nuclear irs spectrum or the agn emission .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ sed ] directly compares the synthetic photometries of the scaled chopped nuclear irs spectrum with the comics core sed to illustrate a good match given the error bars . here ,",
    "the scaling is to account for the flux ratio between the core and core+halo seds (  [ radial_profile_analysis ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the core sed can be explained by spectrum showing little pah features in the same way for the core+halo sed .",
    "alternatively , the core sed can be explained by an absorbed power - law continuum of the agn . to demonstrate this",
    ", we applied an absorption on type-1 agn sed template of @xcite by an apparent optical depth at 9.7  @xmath2 m ( @xmath79 ) of @xmath80 ( top panel of figure  [ agnsed ] ) . here , we assumed simple foreground dust absorption with an extinction curve of @xcite toward the galactic center .",
    "we found that this model , though it is unrealistically simple , can reproduce the observation reasonably well , except for n8.8 where the photometry quality is the worst .",
    "note that this optical depth is much larger than that measured with irs ( @xmath810.00.04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is most likely due to less contamination at the comics resolution by circumnuclear less - absorbed star - forming region .",
    "we further examine the agn models for the core sed by using the recent sophisticated agn sed models with clumpy torus .",
    "it has been known that the observed shallower silicate absorption at 9.7  @xmath2 m even in the compton - think agns can be reproduced by the agn clumpy torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent more advanced radiative - transfer calculations for the clumpy torus medium not only successfully reproduce the mir seds of both type-1 and type-2 agns but also provide the basis to compare with the observed spatial distribution of the infrared emission in the central parsec - scale regions of agns in the interferometric studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are three groups in the model parameters : those that define the intrinsic radiation from the accretion disk , dusty torus properties such as size and density distribution as well as the dust composition , and observer s viewing angle of the torus .",
    "the agn luminosity sets overall flux scale of the emergent sed , not the relative sed shape , as long as the inner torus radius is set at the dust sublimation temperature , due to scaling relation of the agn torus radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative sed shape is then determined mostly by overall torus shape ( opening angle of the central dust - free zone of the torus and outer radius of the torus ) , distribution of dusts ( or dust clouds ) within the torus , average optical depth ( or mean optical depth of each clump and the average number of the clumps ) along the torus equatorial plane , as well as the viewing angle .",
    "in particular , two most important characteristics of the observed mir sed , the apparent depth of the silicate absorption at 9.7  @xmath2 m and the overall slope ( redness ) of the continuum , are mostly determined by the combination of the radial dust distribution , the average optical depth along the torus equatorial plane , and the viewing angle ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    ".    how can we explain discrepancy between the mir and x - ray measurements of the hydrogen column density toward the agn ?",
    "in the simple absorbed agn model with foreground absorption (  [ results_core ] ) , the apparent optical depth at the silicate absorption ( @xmath124 ) corresponds to @xmath125 @xmath6 .",
    "this order - of - magnitude estimate is based on the @xmath126 conversion ( @xmath127 ; @xcite ) and a standard gas - to - dust ratio within the galactic interstellar medium ( @xmath7/@xmath128 @xmath6 mag@xmath84 ) .",
    "this absorption is much smaller than expected for the compton - thick column density measured in the x - ray ( @xmath129 @xmath6 ; @xcite ; @xmath130 @xmath6 ; @xcite ) in spite of considerable uncertainties in this very simple model and the conversion factors . however , the clumpy agn torus is known not to create very deep silicate absorption even in the compton - thick condition (  [ intro ] ) .",
    "in fact , we found that the model seds of the agn clumpy torus ( cat3d ; @xcite ; skirtor 2.0 ; @xcite ) reproduce the observed core sed reasonably well (  [ results_core ] ) . as expected ,",
    "the hydrogen column density of the acceptable models is much larger than the estimate based on the apparent small optical depth at 9.7  @xmath2 m : for example , with cat3d models , the average total optical depth in the equatorial plane of the torus is @xmath131 ( table  [ sedfit ] ) , corresponding to @xmath132 @xmath6 in the edge - on viewing angle with the same standard gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "therefore , the agn clumpy torus models acceptable for the mir core sed are consistent with the x - ray observations in terms of the hydrogen column density toward the agn .",
    "we need to caution that , although we successfully demonstrated that the agn clumpy torus models can reproduce the core mir sed , there is no direct hint to suggest that the torus structure dominates the mir emission in m51 . even though such model seds are known to represent agn seds in general reasonably well ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "there is mounting evidence recently to indicate that most of the mir emission comes from the extended polar region of the agns , rather than from the torus as expected in the agn unification theory (  [ intro ] ) .",
    "in addition , although our argument based on the mir and x - ray luminosity correlation indicates that the agn dominates the core mir sed , this dose not mean that the emission comes from the agn torus .",
    "@xcite showed based on their 8 m single - dish observations of nearby agns at mir that some small fraction of their sample with sufficiently good observations shows the polar extensions , suggesting that such polar extension commonly exists in agns .",
    "because the mir and x - ray luminosity correlation we used in our discussion is based on the total mir luminosities of the compact nucleus including the ( not well resolved ) polar components @xcite , our correlation analysis may suggest similar polar component in the m51 agn at mir .",
    "therefore , we need to wait for the future mir interferometric observations to reveal the structure of the mir core in m51 .",
    "we found a signature of agn influence in the nuclear irs spectrum that shows remarkable differences from the off - nucleus one , and in the irac ch4/ch3 flux ratio map .",
    "previously , the agn influence is found in the nuclear concentration of the hot ( @xmath1344001000",
    "k ) h@xmath75 gas @xcite , the enhanced high - ionization ( 97.1  ev ) line of [ ne  v ] ( @xcite ;  [ spitzer_data_analysis ] ) , and pah deficiency at the nucleus at the irs resolution ( @xcite ; see also  [ results_core_halo ] ) .",
    "the pah - deficient mir spectrum is typically seen in agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is most likely due to destruction of pah particles in the circumnuclear region due to intense hard photons from agn and/or strong shock associated with agn jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we found the smaller irac ch4/ch3 flux ratio at @xmath135  pc scale around the nucleus well beyond the irac resolution ( @xmath136 fwhm or 70  pc ; figure  [ findingchart ] ) , which is likely due to deficient pah features in the ch4 ( the 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath2 m features ) that are typically very bright in the star - forming regions (  [ spitzer_data_analysis ] ) .",
    "the region with the smaller ch4/ch3 flux ratio roughly coincides with the extended radio jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , optical narrow - line region nebula ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the soft x - ray nebula @xcite , and the jet - entrained shocked outflowing molecular - gas clouds @xcite .",
    "the irac flux ratio is smallest near the nucleus , where the chopped nuclear irs spectrum shows little pah emission (  [ results_core_halo ] ) .",
    "these characteristics indicate more pronounced pah destruction near the agn .",
    "the nuclear [ ne  v ] emission also suggests significant agn contribution at the nucleus at the irs resolution , because this line is usually considered as a tracer of either excitation by agn hard photons or strong shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed [ ne  ii]/[ne  v ] flux ratio ( @xmath27 ;  [ spitzer_data_analysis ] ) is only one tenth of the one in star - forming regions ( @xmath137 ) and is much closer to the one in seyfert galaxies ( @xmath138 ; @xcite ) .",
    "what is the nature of the extended halo found in the comics images at a few tens  pc scale ?",
    "the halo sed is similar to the chopped nuclear irs spectrum (  [ results_halo ] ) , suggesting the circumnuclear star formation showing little pah emission as we discussed above .",
    "alternatively , the halo could be the very extended polar mir emission of agns sometimes seen even with the single - dish observations ( e.g. , @xcite ;  [ intro ] ) .",
    "in fact , the mir - to - x - ray luminosity ratio by using the combined comics core+halo flux , log @xmath117(@xmath139m)/@xmath117(210  kev)@xmath140 , is still consistent with the agns in general in the sample of @xcite .",
    "however , the former star formation model seems preferred to explain the strong [ ne  ii ] emission in the halo (  [ results_halo ] ) .",
    "this is because strong [ ne  ii ] is typically associated with the star forming region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas the dust continuum emission dominates , without any significant [ ne  ii ] emission , in the extended polar regions in the interferometric spectroscopies of the best - studied nearby agns showing the polar emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , the halo is likely the circumnuclear star - forming regions affected by the central agn , like in the case of the more extended region traced by the smaller irac ch4/ch3 flux ratio .",
    "previous molecular line observations in mm / sub - mm wavelength have shown much smaller hydrogen column density toward the m51 nucleus than expected for the compton - thick agn .",
    "this discrepancy , however , can be explained if the molecular gas is mostly associated with an one - parsec - scale torus . @xcite",
    "found a compact nuclear molecular - gas concentration at @xmath141 resolution , which is likely associated with the mir core , because the halo is more extended to @xmath142 fwhm .",
    "they calculated the h@xmath75 column density of @xmath143  @xmath6 ( or @xmath144 @xmath6 ) toward the nucleus . here , they measured the emission - line luminosity and converted it to the hydrogen number by assuming metallicity and excitation conditions of the gas .",
    "they also assumed that the source extends just over the observing beam .",
    "@xcite then studied physical conditions of the molecular gas based on multi - line / multi - transition molecular - line analysis , and found that effect of gas excitation and metallicity alone can not explain apparently very small column density reported earlier . on the other hand",
    ", the beam dilution effect seems to significantly affect the column density measurement .",
    "we showed in this study that the mir core is unresolved with the 039 ( 13  pc ) fwhm beam , and the one - sigma upper limit is 018 ( 6  pc ) fwhm (  [ radial_profile_analysis ] ) . if we adopt 1  pc as a fiducial torus size following statistics of nearby agns studied by infrared interferometry @xcite and assume that most of the molecular gas is associated with this very compact torus , the column density is now calculated to be @xmath145  @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite already did the same calculation , but we now have better size constraint of the m51 core as well as better statistics of the agn torus size in infrared .",
    "@xcite argued that mean gas density of the torus in this case is @xmath146 @xmath147 , being roughly consistent with their multi - line / multi - transition molecular - line analysis results ( @xmath148 @xmath147 ) .",
    "therefore , a model of one - parsec - scale , dusty , and molecular - gas - rich torus can solve the apparent column density discrepancy between the x - ray and molecular - line measurements .",
    "although we can not conclude in this study that the mir core is attributed to the agn torus (  [ nature_core ] ) , future study of the m51 agn at even higher spatial resolution in both infrared and sub - mm / mm wavelengths would provide us a direct view of not only the material distribution but also the fueling and feedback processes in the vicinity of the agn .",
    "we performed near - diffraction - limited ( @xmath0 fwhm resolution ) @xmath1-band imaging of one of the nearest compton - thick agns in m51 with comics at the subaru telescope to study the nuclear structure and sed at 813  @xmath2 m .",

    "we measured the mir surface brightness of the m51 core at 11.2  @xmath2 m to be @xmath112 @xmath108/pc@xmath109 .",
    "although this surface brightness is almost comparable to that of known agns ( @xmath107 @xmath108/pc@xmath109 ; @xcite ) , it is not high enough to exclude a possibility of a very compact nuclear star cluster as an origin of the core .",
    "the core+halo sed is almost flat with slightly increasing flux at longer wavelength . in order to interpret this sed",
    ", we made the `` chopped '' nuclear irs spectrum to follow the comics chopping observation by subtracting the off - nuclear `` sky '' spectrum from the nucleus one .",
    "this shows continuum - dominated spectrum with molecular hydrogen and [ ne  ii ] 12.8  @xmath2 m emission lines but little pah emission .",
    "we found that the core+halo sed is reproduced by this pah - deficient starburst spectrum .",
    "the sed of the halo alone is similar to the core+halo sed , and is also reproduced by similar pah - deficient spectrum with the [ ne  ii ] .",
    "in addition , we found that the irac 8.0  @xmath2m/5.6  @xmath2 m flux ratio is smaller within @xmath152  pc from the nucleus , also suggesting deficient pah 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath2 m features that are typically very bright in the star - forming regions .",
    "the pah particles in the circumnuclear region are likely destroyed either by intense hard photons from the agn and/or strong shock associated with the agn jet .",
    "the core sed is similar to the core+halo sed , and it can be reproduced by a star - forming cluster within the core showing the pah - deficient spectrum . alternatively ,",
    "the agn clumpy torus model seds @xcite can reproduce the red mir continuum with moderate apparent silicate 9.7  @xmath2 m absorption ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "although we can not discriminate the two possibilities on the basis of the mir sed examination , we found that the observed ratio of the mir and absorption - corrected intrinsic x - ray ( 210  kev ) luminosities is consistent with the one for agns in general .",

    "<S> we performed near - diffraction - limited ( @xmath0 fwhm ) @xmath1-band imaging of one of the nearest active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in m51 with 8.2 m subaru telescope to study the nuclear structure and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at 813  @xmath2 m . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the nucleus is composed of an unresolved core ( at @xmath3  pc resolution , or intrinsic size corrected for the instrumental effect of @xmath4  pc ) and an extended halo ( at a few tens  pc scale ) , and each of their seds is almost flat . </S>",
    "<S> we examined the sed by comparing with the archival _ </S>",
    "<S> spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> irs spectrum processed to mimic our chopping observation of the nucleus , and the published radiative - transfer model seds of the agn clumpy dusty torus . </S>",
    "<S> the halo sed is likely due to circumnuclear star formation showing little polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission due to the agn . </S>",
    "<S> the core sed is likely dominated by the agn because of the following two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the clumpy torus model seds can reproduce the red mid - infrared continuum with apparently moderate silicate 9.7  @xmath2 m absorption . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the core 12  @xmath2 m luminosity and the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity at 210  kev in the literature follow the mid - infrared  x - ray luminosity correlation known for the nearby agns including the compton - thick ones . </S>"
