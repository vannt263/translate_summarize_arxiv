    "there exists an essentially unique function @xmath11 in the sobolev space @xmath12 ( functions with first order derivatives locally in @xmath13 ) which satisfies almost everywhere and is a _ homeomorphism of the plane_. these functions are called quasiconformal .",
    "it turns out that @xmath11 may change drastically the hausdorff dimension of sets .",
    "indeed , sets of arbitrarily small positive hausdorff dimension may be mapped into sets of hausdorff dimension as close to @xmath14 as desired ( and the other way around by the inverse mapping ) .",
    "there has been during the last decades much hard and penetrating work in understanding how @xmath11 distorts sets ( see , for instance @xcite and the references given there or @xcite for a recent result ) .",
    "on the other hand , orientation preserving bilipschitz homeomorphisms of the plane are easily seen to satisfy a beltrami equation for a certain beltrami coefficent @xmath15 since bilipschitz mappings preserve all metric properties of sets , in particular hausdorff dimension , they appear to be a distinguished subclass of particularly simple quasiconformal mappings . in @xcite",
    "one gives geometric conditions which are necessary and sufficient for @xmath11 being bilipschitz , but which do not involve the beltrami coefficient @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , it is widely accepted that the problem of characterizing in an efficient way those @xmath8 which determine bilipschitz mappings is hopeless .",
    "a classical result that goes back to schauder ( @xcite ) asserts that @xmath11 is of class  @xmath16 provided @xmath8 is a compactly supported function in @xmath17 .",
    "it is then not difficult to see that @xmath11 is indeed bilipschitz .",

    "if @xmath1 is a disc then corollary 1 reduces to the fact that @xmath11 can be computed explicitly and that one can check by direct inspection that is bilipschitz . if @xmath1 is a square @xmath29 , then one can show that the mapping @xmath11 associated to @xmath30 is not lipschitz for some @xmath27 of modulus less than @xmath6 , so that the corollary and thus the theorem are sharp as far as the smoothness of the boundaries of the @xmath24 is concerned .",
    "recall that a @xmath8-quasi - regular function on a domain @xmath31 is a complex function @xmath3 in @xmath32 satisfying ( 1 ) , with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath3 , almost everywhere in @xmath31 . by stoilow",

    "this improves on mori s theorem , which asserts that , for general @xmath8 , @xmath3 is locally in @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "thus , from the perspective of pde , the theorem may also be viewed as a regularity result for the beltrami equation .",
    "the beltrami equation is intimately related to second order elliptic equations in divergence form ot the type @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 symmetric elliptic matrix with bounded measurable coefficients and determinant @xmath6 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "there is some overlapping here with previous results by li and vogelius ( @xcite ) and li and nirenberg ( @xcite ) .",
    "see at the end of the introduction for more about that .",
    "another application of our theorem concerns removability problems .",
    "there has recently been a renewed interest in gaining a better understanding of the nature of removable sets for bounded quasi - regular functions ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . since bilipschitz mappings preserve removable sets for bounded holomorphic functions ( @xcite ) , the theorem immediately says that the removable sets for bounded @xmath8-quasi - regular functions , with @xmath8 as in the theorem , are exactly the removable sets for bounded holomorphic functions .",
    "if @xmath1 is a domain , the @xmath58 norm of a function @xmath3 on @xmath1 is @xmath59 where @xmath60    the main difficulty in proving the theorem lies in the fact that no smallness assumption is made on @xmath61 . in the same vein ,",
    "corollary 1 is much more difficult to prove if @xmath62 is close to  @xmath6 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath63 is small enough ( depending on @xmath24 ) for each @xmath64 , then the theorem becomes easier .",
    "similarly , the corollary 1 becomes easier under the assumption that @xmath65 .",
    "see a sketch of the argument at the end of section 2 .",
    "the scheme for the proof of the theorem is inspired by a clever idea of iwaniec  @xcite in the context of @xmath66 spaces , which has been further exploited in @xcite .",
    "this idea brings into play the index theory of fredholm operators on banach spaces and , thus , compact operators .",
    "our underlying banach space is @xmath67 a domain with boundary of class  @xmath2 , and on this space we estimate the beurling transform and its powers .",
    "we also show that the commutator between the beurling transform and certain functions is compact on appropriate larger lipschitz spaces .",
    "the beurling transform is the principal value convolution operator    @xmath68 the fourier multiplier of @xmath69 is @xmath70 , or , in other words , @xmath71 thus @xmath69 is an isometry on @xmath72 .",
    "our main lemma shows that for each even smooth homogeneous caldern - zygmund operator @xmath73 the mapping @xmath74 sends continuously @xmath75 into itself , where @xmath1 is a bounded domain with boundary of class @xmath76 throughout the paper we understand that , for @xmath77 @xmath78 the above boundedness result fails if @xmath73 is not even . as a simple example , one may take as @xmath73 the hilbert transform and as @xmath1 the interval @xmath79 .",
    "the even character of @xmath73 is used in the proof of the main lemma in the form @xmath80 which should be understood as a local version of the global cancellation property  @xmath81 common to all smooth homogeneous caldern - zygmund operators .",
    "this was proved by iwaniec for the beurling transform in @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we present a detailed sketch of the proof and we introduce the lemmas required . in section 3 the main lemma is proved in @xmath82 .",
    "section 4 deals with commutators .",
    "we compare in section 5 the operator @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath1 a bounded domain with boundary of class  @xmath2 , and we show that the difference is compact on @xmath85 , for @xmath86",
    ". in section 6 one completes the proof of the theorem for the case of one domain .",
    "section 7 contains the reduction to the one domain case . in section 8",
    "we present an extension of the theorem to what seems to be its more natural setting , namely domains with cusps whose boundary is of class @xmath16 off the set of cusps .",
    "applications to the regularity theory of solutions of equation is this setting are also mentioned .",
    "after a first version of the paper was completed , daniel faraco brought to our attention the work of li and vogelius @xcite ( and @xcite ) , which deals with lipschitz regularity for the equation in @xmath82 for matrices with entries satisfying a lipschitz condition of order @xmath87 on finitely many disjoint domains with boundary of class @xmath16 , but with possible jumps across the boundaries .",
    "the closures of the domains were disjoint and a main point was to obtain gradient estimates independent of the mutual distances between the closed domains .",
    "this is not an issue for our methods , which even allow touching domains .",
    "moreover , as stated before in corollary 2 , for each solution of we obtain a regularity of class @xmath88 , for each @xmath89 in each domain .",
    "this is almost the expected best possible result , namely @xmath16 in each domain . in @xcite",
    "there is a more substantial loss , due to the techniques employed . on the other hand ,",
    "the setting in @xcite and @xcite is more general , in the sense that one works in @xmath82 , there is no restriction on the determinant of the matrix and also non - homogeneous terms are considered .",
    "we also learnt from antonio crdoba that the regularity theory of the euler equation in 2d , in particular the regularity theory of vortex patches , makes broad use of even caldern - zygmund operators , the beurling transform in particular .",
    "we then became aware of the article @xcite , in which one also proves the main lemma .",
    "however , the proof there is different , and certainly not as much in the caldern - zygmund tradition as ours .",
    "first of all , there is a standard factorization method in quasiconformal mapping theory that reduces the theorem to the case of only one domain @xmath90 the argument is presented in detail in section 7 .",
    "then , from now on we will assume that @xmath8 vanishes off some domain @xmath1 with boundary of class  @xmath2 and that @xmath91    as is well known , @xmath11 is given explicitly by the formula @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the cauchy transform of @xmath34 .",
    "recall the important relation between the cauchy and the beurling transforms : @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the function @xmath96 is determined by the equation @xmath97 as soon as we can invert the operator @xmath98 on @xmath85 , for some @xmath99 satisfying @xmath86 , then @xmath100 and thus @xmath34 is in @xmath85 and , in particular , is bounded on @xmath1 . by the beltrami equation ,",

    ", @xmath104 is in @xmath102 ( see below ) , and so @xmath11  is a lipschitz function on the plane .    showing that @xmath11 is bilipschitz still requires an argument .",
    "indeed , we have shown up to now that @xmath11 is of class @xmath105 and thus its jacobian is non - zero at each point of @xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.1 , p.  233 ) ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath11 is conformal on @xmath101 and thus the jacobian is also non - zero there .",
    "however we can not infer immediately that the jacobian is bounded below away from zero either on @xmath1 or on @xmath101 .",
    "this is proved in section  [ sec6 ] and hence @xmath106  is bilipschitz .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath107 is invertible on @xmath85 for each @xmath99 with @xmath86 . for @xmath3 in @xmath75",
    "set @xmath108 where , as we said in the introduction , @xmath109 stands for @xmath110 following @xcite we define @xmath111 so that we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 can be easily seen to be a finite sum of operators that contain as a factor the commutator @xmath114 .",
    "lemma 3 in section 4 asserts that @xmath115 is compact on @xmath85 for each @xmath99 less than @xmath116 , so that @xmath117 is also compact on @xmath85 .",
    "one would like to have now that the operator norm of @xmath118 on @xmath85 is small if @xmath119 is large .",
    "would this be so , then @xmath120 would be a fredholm operator on @xmath85 .",
    "but it looks like a difficult task to obtain estimates for the operator norm of @xmath83 better than the obvious exponential upper bound @xmath121 .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by finding an expression of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 is compact on @xmath85 .",
    "this is done in theorem 1 in section 5 . incidentally , in turns out that @xmath124 when @xmath1 is a disc , so that in this case @xmath125 is exactly @xmath126 for each @xmath119 .",
    "then can be rewritten as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is compact on @xmath85 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath129 may be computed explicitly , for instance via a fourier transform argument @xcite , and one obtains @xmath130 thus the caldern - zygmund constant of @xmath131 , namely , @xmath132 is less than @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a positive constant . hence , by the main lemma @xmath135 which tells us that the operator norm of @xmath136 as an operator on @xmath85 is small for large @xmath119 .",
    "therefore @xmath120 is a fredholm operator on @xmath85 .",
    "clearly @xmath137 , @xmath138 is a continuous path from the identity to @xmath120 . by the index theory of fredholm operators on banach spaces ( e.g.  @xcite ) ,",
    "the index is a continuous function of the operator .",
    "hence @xmath120 has index @xmath139 . on",
    "the other hand @xmath120 is injective , because if @xmath140 , then @xmath141 , which is possible only if @xmath142 .",
    "thus @xmath120 is invertible on @xmath85 .    as we mentioned before , the proof of the theorem simplifies if @xmath143 is assumed to be less than a small number @xmath144 .",
    "in this case one can invert @xmath145 by a neumann series and get @xmath146 by the main lemma @xmath147 is bounded on @xmath75 .",
    "denote by @xmath148 its operator norm and assume that @xmath149 .",
    "then @xmath150 but is also part of the main lemma that @xmath151 hence , if we also assume that @xmath152 , we have @xmath153 thus @xmath154 and so @xmath11 is a lipschitz function . that @xmath11 is bilipschitz follows from @xmath155",
    "in this section we move to @xmath82 .",
    "we say that a bounded domain @xmath156 has a boundary of class @xmath2 if @xmath157 is a @xmath158 hyper - surface whose unit normal vector satisfies a lipschitz condition of order @xmath116 as a function on the surface . to state an alternative condition , for @xmath159 we use the notation @xmath160 , where @xmath161 . then @xmath1 has a boundary of class @xmath2 if for each point",

    "thus we get @xmath167    a smooth ( of class @xmath158 ) homogeneous caldern - zygmund operator is a principal value convolution operator of type @xmath168 where @xmath169 @xmath170 being a homogeneous function of degree  @xmath139 , continuously differentiable on @xmath171 and with zero integral on the unit sphere .",
