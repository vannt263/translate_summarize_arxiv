    "in recent works there appears interest in nonlocal cosmological models derived from string field theory in connection with problem of describing cosmological inflation or accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "modern cosmological data indicates that expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "it may be owing to a component of the universe with negative pressure , dark energy .",
    "recent results of wmap @xcite together with ia supernovae data give us the following range for the dark energy state parameter @xmath2 . in the assumption that the value of the state parameter changes in the range @xmath3 there exist different theoretical models for the dark energy ( see reviews @xcite and references therein )  quintessence models @xcite , k - essence@xcite , quintom models @xcite , models constructed on the dbi action ( see reviews @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) and dilatonic models @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath1 corresponds to models with cosmological constant , which are also possible .",
    "we also can find in the literature models related @xmath4 with modified gravity @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial possibility is the case @xmath4 , that means the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "one of the possibilities is to consider the phantom universe @xcite .",
    "there were proposed several coupled scalar - gravity models in which the null energy condition is violated , but as an effect most such models are unstable@xcite .",
    "recently it was proposed another possibility to consider dark energy description in the context of @xmath5-brane decay in cubic superstring field theory @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath5-brane decay can be interpreted at least at late times as a phantom model . note that unlike phenomenological phantom models here phantom is an effective theory . since",
    "string field theory by itself is a consistent quantizable theory this approach does not suffer from instabilities which are inevitable for phenomenological phantom models @xcite .",
    "such a nonlocal cosmological models were also considered in @xcite .    at the same time",
    "there have been a number of attempts to realize description of the early universe via nonlocal cosmological models @xcite .",
    "one example is @xmath0-adic inflation model @xcite which is represented by nonlocal @xmath0-adic string theory coupled to gravity . for this model ,",
    "a rolling inflationary solution was constructed and the interesting features were discussed and compared with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations .",
    "the possibility of obtaining large nongaussian signatures in the cmb has also been considered in a general class of single field nonlocal hill - top inflation models @xcite .",
    "another example is investigation of the inflation near a maximum of the nonlocal potential when non - local derivative operators are included in the inflaton lagrangian .",
    "it was found that higher - order derivative operators in the inflaton lagrangian can support a prolonged phase of slow - roll inflation near a maximum of the potential @xcite .",
    "it may happen that both early stage and contemporarily universe can be explained with a single nonlocal model derived from string field theory . to be able to tell more about the early stage we need to consider perturbations in nonlocal models",
    ". it will be very interesting to compare obtained results in particular with those in @xcite . to be able to do it the new technique for solving nonlinear friedmann equation is required which",
    "will hopefully be provided in the present work where for the first time construction of solution of the full nonlocal friedmann equations is presented .",
    "that is why in the present work we discuss numerical solution of friedmann equations and their features in more detail .",
    "one of the popular examples of nonlocal models is the @xmath5-brane decay in the gravitational background in the framework of string field theory which is described by the following tachyon action @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the metric , @xmath8 is reduced planck mass , @xmath9 is tachyon field , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is usual beltrami - laplace operator , @xmath13 is tension of the @xmath14 brane , @xmath15 is the effective cosmological constant .",
    "note that covariant string field theory as of today is constructed only in the flat background .",
    "it was built only for some special types of non - flat backgrounds , in particular , in the anti - de sitter background @xcite and in the plane wave background @xcite .",
    "so the action ( [ tach - ac ] ) at the special choice of @xmath16 is a direct generalization for the approximated tachyon action to the case of arbitrary metric .    the action ( [ tach - ac ] ) in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background @xmath17 leads to the following friedmann equations @xmath18 @xmath19 which have the same form as the usual equations except for extra term in the expression for the energy @xmath20 and pressure @xmath21 which appear from the nonlocal interaction and which contain the hubble function .",
    "this term makes these friedmann equations more complicated even for numerical consideration .",
    "more precisely , @xmath22 where @xmath23 the field equation reads @xmath24 here and below we will denote by @xmath25 usual function derivative .",
    "the beltrami - laplace operator takes the form @xmath26 .    in the case of cubic potential",
    "the action ( [ tach - ac ] ) corresponds to the the tachyon in bosonic string field theory @xcite for the lowest level in the level truncated scheme@xcite with the induced twisted space - time .",
    "it is supposed that that we are dealing with @xmath14-brane in the @xmath27 space - time and the volume of the @xmath28 compactified subspace is omitted .",
    "the case of quartic potential in the action ( [ tach - ac ] ) corresponds to inclusion of the metric in the tachyon action of the fermionic cubic string @xcite in the approximation of a slowly varying auxiliary field @xcite .",
    "such an action appears in the level truncated scheme where only lowest scalar field ( tachyon field ) in the gso(- ) sector and correspondingly the lowest scalar field in the gso(+ ) sector ( this field does not have kinetic term and is considered as auxiliary field ) are considered .",
    "integration over the auxiliary field results in the quartic potential for the tachyon field .",
    "note that appearance of the non - extremal @xmath5-brane in the framework of fermionic string field theory requires gso(- ) sector in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to consider a general class of nonlocal cosmological models of the form ( [ tach - ac ] ) and discuss which physical properties and consequences might be obtained from such models . among them",
    "we will be interested firstly in the classical solutions of the corresponding friedmann equations which can be considered as a first approximation to the quantum solutions and might be useful for the study of ways to avoid the cosmological singularity problem @xcite .",
    "we start with the description of some general class of nonlocal models . in section 3",
    "we will describe new numerical algorithm for solving nonlocal friedmann equations . in section 4",
    "we will present the numerical solutions of friedmann equations for different parameters and will provide analytical explanation for some of their interesting features . in section 5 we will consider which cosmological solutions can be provided by nonlocal models .",
    "in this paper we will consider the following nonlocal scalar field on the @xmath5-brane coupled to the gravity @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the metric , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is a planck mass , @xmath32 is a characteristic string scale related with the string tension @xmath33 as @xmath34 , @xmath9 is a scalar field , @xmath35 is a dimensionless four dimensional effective coupling constant related with the ten dimensional string coupling constant @xmath36 and the compactification scale , @xmath37 is an effective four dimensional cosmological constant , @xmath13 is the brane tension , @xmath38 is a nonlocal coupling constant @xcite .    for further investigation let us rewrite our action in dimensionless space - time variables @xmath39 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless scalar field , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    as a particular metric we take frw one @xmath42    we will consider spatially homogeneous configurations for which beltrami - laplace operator takes the form @xmath43 for the convenience of numerical calculations let us introduce the following notation @xmath44 , which we will understand as generalization of second order time derivative , which contains extra term @xmath45 associated with gravitational background",
    ".    equation of motion for the space homogeneous configurations for the scalar field @xmath46 takes the form @xmath47    the friedmann equations have the following form @xmath48    for the case of nonlocal potentials the energy and the pressure have additional non - local terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath22 where    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    as we can see the structure of friedmann equations and of equation for scalar field in this model is rather complicated and their study is already a very interesting mathematical problem and can be considered as a separate mathematical investigation .    to avoid calculation of @xmath54 term which is much harder to compute than @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) as computation of the former results in an ill - posed problem @xcite we will use the following representation for nonlocal energy terms on the equation of motion for the scalar field    @xmath57    @xmath58",
    "for numerical calculations let us rewrite our system in the following form    [ fr ] @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61    in this paper we would like to point out which physical results we can extract from solutions of this system .",
    "first , we will find hubble function and the scalar field from equations ( [ fr2 ] ) and ( [ field - eq ] ) .",
    "it happens that equation ( [ fr1 ] ) plays a role of energy conservation from which the effective cosmological constant is extracted and is unique for every field configuration .",
    "integrating equation ( [ fr2 ] ) we get the following system    [ eqns ] @xmath62 @xmath63.\\ ] ]    to find solutions of the system ( [ eqns ] ) we construct the following iterative process    [ iter - procedure ] @xmath64 where iterations @xmath65 and @xmath66 are in turn obtained as limits of sub - iterations @xmath67 which are recursively defined as ( @xmath68 ) @xmath69,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where initial iteration in @xmath70 is taken as @xmath71    by @xmath72 we denote a function inverse to @xmath73 .",
    "note how sub - iteration @xmath74 depends only on @xmath66 , i.e. the whole step of sub - iterations for @xmath75 .",
    "note also that @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 , this is essentially a way to accelerate convergence .",
    "intuitively this iteration procedure does the following .",
    "first fixing @xmath66 it finds @xmath77 using iteration process ( [ it - pr - onefieldforgivenh ] ) which is a natural generalization of a process which is described in @xcite and for which convergence is proved analytically .",
    "then @xmath78 is obtained by iterating ( [ fr2-proint - itpr ] ) where @xmath77 is fixed as computed in the previous step .",
    "thus found @xmath78 is used to find @xmath79 and so on .",
    "this kind of multi - step iterative procedure are known to provide rapid convergence . in our experiments",
    "this iterative procedure converges much more reliably as compared to more naive iterative procedure where one does not do intermediate iterations .    in a similar fashion one",
    "can construct iterative procedures for systems with several scalar fields such as those studied in @xcite .",
    "equations of motion as well as the iteration method discussed above require computation of action with operator @xmath55 on a given function .",
    "computationally this is a nontrivial problem by itself .",
    "we use the following method which beside giving mathematical definition for such an operator more importantly provides corresponding computational method .",
    "result of the acting with operator @xmath81 on a given function @xmath82 is natural to define as a solution of the following diffusion partial differential equation with corresponding initial and boundary conditions @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "note that here evolution goes along @xmath86 axis , while @xmath87 plays a role of space .",
    "solution of ( [ f - rho - t ] ) is a rigorous mathematical definition of the operator @xmath81 acting on function @xmath88 @xmath89 such solution exists and is unique for wide classes of @xmath75 and @xmath88 @xcite . since in standard settings",
    "such a diffusion problem is well defined in particular for @xmath90 which seem to suffice applications which are considered here we will not discuss this topic any further .",
    "so far we did not specify exact shape of the potential for our system .",
    "in this paper we are interested in coupled to the gravity a tachyon field which appears as a lowest excitation in level truncation scheme for fermionic string field theory @xcite .",
    "thus all further discussion will be about quartic potential @xmath91 we would like to note though that from numerical perspective this potential can lead to difficulties as it results in solutions which are not differentiable at zero ( they behave as @xmath92 at in the vicinity of zero @xcite ) .",
    "for the later reason we found it useful to study similar problem in potential @xmath93 as @xmath94 this potential tends to potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the interesting property of this potential is that solution has finite derivative at zero and moreover there is a theorem which states convergence of our type of iterative procedure in case of minkowski metric @xcite .",
    "let us return to the potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ field - eq ] ) is invariant under shifts @xmath95 and mirroring @xmath96 thus it is natural to look for odd solutions . without loss of generality we can set @xmath97 .    equation ( [ field - eq ] ) has the following constant solutions @xmath98 following the same logic as in minkowsky case @xcite since @xmath99 we can expect existence of kink - type solutions where scalar field interpolates between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "iterative procedure ( [ iter - procedure ] ) requires initial iteration @xmath102 , @xmath103 to be specified explicitly . to find such kink solutions it is natural to take @xmath104 this initial iteration leads to a rapid convergence .",
    "it is interesting that our numerical experiments show that iterative procedure ( [ iter - procedure ] ) converges to a kink - type solution if we start from any two bounded functions which are positive on positive semi - axis and negative on negative one .",
    "this observation provides a strong indication for uniqueness of the solutions ( up to shifts and mirroring ) .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is determined during level - truncation procedure , its value is @xmath106 nevertheless since different values of @xmath105 already in minkowski case result in different physical pictures we will systematically consider various values of @xmath105 .",
    "note also that the case @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath0-adic string with @xmath108 .",
    "the value of nonlocal coupling constant is fixed by the same procedure it is @xmath11 in our case .",
    "in what follows for numerical computations we put @xmath109 . we used iterative method presented in the previous section to solve friedmann equations for our system .",
    "we observe the crucial role of the value of @xmath105 , as it varies the following physical properties of the system are affected ( see fig.[h - iter ] ) .    * for @xmath107",
    "the solution in both @xmath46 and @xmath75 has a monotonic kink shape .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to the case of minkowsky metric @xcite .",
    "* there exists a critical value @xmath110 which determines between types of the @xmath46 component of the solution  kink or oscillatory with finite period . for @xmath111",
    "the solution has a kink shape with exponentially decreasing oscillations around @xmath112 as @xmath113 . on the other hand if @xmath114 the solution converts to oscillations with finite period .",
    "has well defined limits at infinite times .",
    "this fact is used in particular for the boundary condition ( [ f - rho - boundary ] ) .",
    "this means that this method is not suitable for finding oscillatory solutions with high precision .",
    "oscillatory behavior reported in this paper was obtained by vastly enlarging the lattice in @xmath87 , this did not allow finding critical value of @xmath105 with more then @xmath115 significant digits .",
    "reliable methods for finding oscillatory solutions for the type of equations considered in this paper is an open mathematical problem even for minkowski metric , see @xcite .",
    "note though that physically significant solutions in this model turned out to be of kink type where iterations rapidly converge . ]",
    "similar behavior was observed in the case of minkowsky metric , although in that case the critical value was higher @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "* there is one more critical value @xmath117 which determines a shape of a hubble function ( see fig.[xi - shape ] ) .",
    "more precisely , as @xmath105 grows hubble function @xmath75 gets a turning point at some positive time @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath119 @xmath75 ends up in tending a negative ( positive ) value as @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) .",
