    "the understanding of electronic phases of alkali - doped fullerides a@xmath0c@xmath1 is a long standing and challenging task for material scientists @xcite .",
    "the prominent feature of these narrow - band molecular materials is the coexistence of strong intrasite jahn - teller ( jt ) effect with strong electron correlation , which underlies the unconventional superconductivity in a@xmath3c@xmath1 @xcite and a broad variations of electronic properties in this series of materials in function of the size of alkali ions , and the degree of their doping @xcite .",
    "external pressure and insertion of neutral spacers add new possibilities for the engineering of their electronic phases @xcite .",
    "this was recently demonstrated for the cs@xmath3c@xmath1 fulleride , which undergoes transitions from mott - hubbard ( mh ) antiferromagnet to a high temperature superconductor ( @xmath638 k ) and then to strongly correlated metal under external pressure @xcite .",
    "signs of jt effect in alkali - doped fullerides were inferred from nmr @xcite , ir @xcite , and eels @xcite spectra , and stm @xcite in various compounds . recently , the parameters governing the complex jt interaction on fullerene anions have been firmly established @xcite , which opened the way for accurate theoretical investigation of the electronic states in fullerides .",
    "it was found that in the mh insulating phase of cubic fullerides such as cs@xmath3c@xmath1 at ambient pressure , the para dynamical jt effect is realized as independent pseudorotations of jt deformations at each c@xmath1 site @xcite . the same para dynamical jt effect was found in the metallic phase of a@xmath3c@xmath1 close to mh transition , while the pseudorotation of jt deformation at different sites are expected to be correlated with further departure from the mh transition due to the increase of the band energy @xcite .",
    "these findings have found confirmation in a very recent investigation of cs@xmath3c@xmath1 fulleride , showing an almost unchanged ir spectrum on both sides in the vicinity of mh metal - insulator transition , while displaying its significant variation when the material was brought deeper into the metallic phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , our calculations have also shown that the metallic phase in these systems exhibits an orbital disproportionation of electronic density as a result of the dynamical jt instability @xcite .",
    "this successful theoretical approach is applied here for the investigation of the electronic phase in the a@xmath5c@xmath1 fullerides , containing an even number of doped electrons per site .",
    "we find that these materials exhibit a dynamical jt instability too . as in a@xmath3c@xmath1 ,",
    "the ground state of a@xmath5c@xmath1 displays again the orbital disproportionation of electronic density , thus identifying it as a universal key feature of the electronic phases of alkali - doped fullerides .",
    "it is well established that the @xmath7 lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) band mainly defines the electronic properties of fullerides @xcite . following the recent treatment of a@xmath3c@xmath1 @xcite , we consider all essential interaction in this band including the one - electron , the bielectronic and the vibronic contributions : @xmath8 , % \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath9 , \\label{eq_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath10 denote the fullerene sites , @xmath11 the neighbours of site @xmath12 , @xmath13 the @xmath7 lumo orbitals ( @xmath14 ) on each c@xmath1 , @xmath15 the spin projections , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are annihilation and creation operators of electron , respectively , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the normal vibrational coordinate for the @xmath21 component of the @xmath22 mode ( @xmath23 ) and its conjugate momentum , respectively , and @xmath24 is clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "the transfer parameters @xmath25 of @xmath26 have been extracted from density functional theory ( dft ) calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for k@xmath3c@xmath1 , supplementary materials and fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) for k@xmath5c@xmath1 ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath27 and the orbital vibronic coupling constant @xmath28 for an effective single - mode jt model of c@xmath29 have been calculated in ref .",
    "the phonon dispersion was neglected because it is weak in fullerides @xcite .",
    "the projection of the bielectronic interaction in the @xmath7 lumo band onto intrasite hamiltonian ( @xmath30 ) is an adequate approximation due to strong molecular character of fullerides @xcite .",
    "the intrasite repulsion parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , obeying the relation @xmath33 , are strongly screened : first , by high - energy interband electron excitations reducing their value from 3 ev to ca 1 ev @xcite and , second , by intra @xmath7-band excitations .",
    "the latter can further reduce @xmath31 and @xmath32 several times @xcite , however , the extent of this screening strongly depends on the character of the correlated @xmath7 band and can , therefore , be assessed only in a self - consistent fashion . on the other hand , the vibronic coupling to the @xmath22 modes , representing a quadrupolar perturbation , is hardly screened .",
    "the same for the hund s rule coupling @xmath34 , for which we take the calculated molecular value @xcite .",
    "we leave @xmath31 as the only free parameter of the theory .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]      l ( a ) +   + ( b ) +    in bct k@xmath5c@xmath1 , the effect of the interorbital hybridization is not strong .",
    "this is directly observed replacing the interorbital transfer parameter with zero . as an example",
    ", we replace the one between the @xmath35 orbital and the @xmath36 orbitals , ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : band](a ) shows the hybridized ( red ) and non - hybridized ( blue ) band structures .",
    "one finds that these two bands are close to each other in almost all @xmath38-points and except for around the @xmath39 point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ibz ] ) . by neglecting the hybridization ,",
    "the split levels of the hybridized band ( around 4.6 ev and 4.9 ev ) become quasi - degenerate ( around 4.7 - 4.8 ev ) . consequently",
    ", the total density of states ( dos ) for the non - hybridized band is enhanced around the range of 4.7 - 4.8 ev and is reduced around 4.6 ev and 4.9 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band](b ) ) .",
    "this hybridization effect is diminished by the splitting of the band due to the jahn - teller effect and coulomb repulsion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : split_band ] ) . here",
    ", we consider the jahn - teller distortion which would give the largest gain of the energy , i.e. , @xmath35 is unstabilized and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are stabilized , and @xmath42 ev .",
    "therefore , bct k@xmath5c@xmath1 can be treated as a non - hybridized band system in a good approximation .",
