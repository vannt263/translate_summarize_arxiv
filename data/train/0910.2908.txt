    "despite of the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite is a ferromagnetic toy model enough amenable for allowing an accurate numerical and analytical characterization , it exhibits many features observed in more realistic long - range interacting systems such as : violent relaxation , persistence of metaequilibrium states , slow collisional relaxation , phase transition , anomalous diffusion , etc .",
    "these features support the reason why it can be considered as a paradigmatic toy model of the real long - range interacting systems @xcite .    the incidence of long - range interactions does not allow to divide this system into independent subsystems even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this fact evidences its intrinsic nonextensive nature , which distinguishes the hmf model from other ferromagnetic models with short - range interactions despite they share many analogies in most of the equilibrium thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "the nonextensivity of the hmf model is particularly important to understand its nontrivial dynamical behavior , which is still an open problem attracting much attention in the last years @xcite .",
    "the present paper of this series @xcite is the first work devoted to study the dynamical behavior of the hmf model with a special emphasis on the relaxation processes undergone by this system during the evolution towards the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we begin performing a general characterization of the most important features of the microscopic dynamics by taking into consideration the results obtained from the analysis of its equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such a study possibilities us to conjecture the equilibration mechanism leading this system to its final relaxation , which is here used to propose a phenomenological approach of the collisional evolution .",

    ", the hmf model represents the long - range interacting version of harmonic oscillators system @xcite since the individual dynamics of a given rotator can be easily rephrased as the dynamics  of the _ mathematical pendulum _ : @xmath11 we have used the polar representation of the magnetization vector @xmath12 and the characteristic units for time and momentum : @xmath13 in terms of the moment of inertia @xmath14 and the coupling constant @xmath15 .",

    "another convenient way to rewrite the dynamics of the hmf model ( [ motion equations ] ) follows from the introduction of the tridimensional vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 where the magnetization vector @xmath25 obeys the following dynamics : @xmath26 being @xmath27 the magnetization rate of change .    a simple inspection of eqs.([oscilator ] ) , ( [ vectorial form ] ) and ( [ magnetization dynamics ] ) allows to understand that the dynamical phenomenology the hmf model can be explained from the conjugation of the dynamical features of the mathematical pendulum and the character of the magnetization vector @xmath25 evolution .",
    "since the individual terms @xmath28 in the  magnetization rate of change @xmath27 have a undefined signature , the dynamical evolution of magnetization vector crucially depends on the correlations among the individual rotators evolution . if present , the magnetization experiences large variations in a timescale comparable with the microscopic time @xmath16 , where takes place a very effective energy interchange among the rotators . this dynamical regime characterized by the existence of a collective motion completely analogue to the one operating in the astrophysical systems , which is usually referred as _ violent relaxation _ @xcite and very - well described by the _ vlasov dynamics_:@xmath29 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\right )   f\\left (   \\theta , p;t\\right )   = 0 , \\label{vd}\\ ] ] with @xmath30   = \\int\\mathbf{m}\\left (   \\theta\\right ) f\\left (   \\theta , p;t\\right )   d\\theta dp$ ] , which accounts the _ collisionless _ regime of the one - body distribution function @xmath31 .",

    "for example , besides of the nontrivial exponent @xmath207 of the power - law growing of @xmath203 reported by yamaguchi _",
    "et al _ in refs.@xcite , they also indicated the following _ n_-dependence of the  quantity @xmath208:@xmath209 if the above estimation of @xmath203 is the correct relaxation timescale associated to the collisional quasi - stationary evolution ( qse ) of the one - body distribution function @xmath118 , the temporal dependence for large @xmath34 should be given by : @xmath210 the above assumption implies that the leading behavior the temporal dependence of the average magnetization should be given by @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is a size - independent function .",
    "thus , the leading behavior of the quantity:@xmath213 _ should be _ @xmath34-_independ _ when @xmath34 is large enough .",
    "since the numerical result ( [ r1 ] ) disagrees with this reasoning , the nontrivial exponent @xmath205 reported in the yamaguchi _",
    "et al _ study might not correspond to the true scaling behavior for @xmath34 very large , but only a finite size behavior which should disappear for @xmath34 large enough .",
    "the size dependence of the collisional relaxation timescale is a question with a primordial importance in order to understand the dynamical features of a long - range interacting system as the hmf model when thermodynamic limit is invoked . as already pointed out by some authors , the existence of relaxation timescale @xmath203 diverging with the imposition of the thermodynamic limit , @xmath214 , leads automatically to the non commutative character of the the thermodynamic limit @xmath215 with the infinite time limit @xmath216 necessary to the equilibration of temporal averages @xmath217 : @xmath218 thus , the imposition of the thermodynamic limit before the infinite time limit makes endless the duration of collisionless dynamics , and therefore , the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium arises as an admissible but particular quasi - stationary state of the violent relaxation .",
    "such a dynamical picture is not only a feature of the hmf model dynamics . on the contrary ,",
    "the large the collisional relaxation times estimates of many astrophysical objects like the elliptical galaxies ( @xmath219  where microscopic timescale @xmath220 ) induces also to suppose the collisionless character of the dynamical evolution of such real long - range interacting systems , which explains the rich variety of structures observed in this context @xcite .",
    "let us use the phenomenological approach of collisional regime in terms of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fokker ] ) in order to analyze the _ n_-dependence of the collisional relaxation timescale @xmath203 .",
    "since the amplitude of the gaussian noises @xmath171 describing the magnetization fluctuations during the quasi - stationary evolution decreases as @xmath36 as well as the underlying correlation times are of order of microscopic timescale @xmath16 ( see in panel c ) of fig.[dyn.coexist.eps ] ) , the correlation matrix @xmath178 ( [ corr.matrix ] ) and the diffusion coefficient @xmath188 ( [ dif.function ] ) decrease as @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the phenomenological picture described in this work suggests that the relevant timescale of the collisional evolution of the hmf model should obey a linear growing @xmath221 .",
    "as already discussed in our previous work @xcite , such a linear _ n_-dependence of @xmath203 seems to be intimately related to the _ n_-dependence of the additive constant of entropy per particle @xmath222 , since the imposition of a scaling dependence of the coupling constant @xmath15 as @xmath223 instead of the usual kac prescription @xcite @xmath224 leads to a _ simultaneous regularization _ of the divergence of the collisional relaxation timescale @xmath225 and the additive constant @xmath226 in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , avoiding in this way the incidence of an undesirable dynamical anomalies like the one described in eq.([non.comm ] ) and the divergence of the thermodynamic potentials .",
    "although the phenomenological approach of collisional relaxation described in this work supports the validity of the linear growing @xmath221 , the problem about the exact _ n_-dependence of collisional relaxation timescale could be definitively solved by means of the development of appropriate kinetic equations starting from the consideration of first principles @xcite .",
    "we shall address in our forthcoming paper an intense investigation of the hmf model dynamics in terms of kinetic equations , where the implementation of suitable kinetic equations starting from the well - known _",
