    "it has been realized for some time that a merging of quantum theory with einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) is necessitated by consistency arguments . in _ gedankenexperimenten _",
    "the interaction of a classical gravitational wave with a quantum system inevitably leads to contradictions @xcite .",
    "arguments of this type are important because no relevant experimental data are available  we are very far from the quantum gravity analogue of the balmer series .",
    "on the other hand , when a quantum theory ( qt ) of gravity is developed along usual lines , one is confronted with a fundamental problem , from which many other ( secondary ) difficulties can be traced .",
    "the crucial difference to quantum field theory ( qft ) in flat space is the fact that the variables of gravity exhibit a dual role , they are fields living on a manifold which is determined by themselves , `` stage '' and `` actors '' coincide .",
    "but there exist also numerous other problems : the time variable , an object with special properties already in qt , in gr appears on an equal footing with the space coordinates ( `` problem of time '' which manifests itself in many disguises ) ; the information paradox @xcite ; perturbative non - renormalizability @xcite etc .",
    "in section [ se:2 ] we discuss some key - points regarding the definition of physical observables in qft and the ensuing ones in quantum gravity ( qgr ) .",
    "then we critically mention some `` old '' and `` new '' approaches to qgr ( section [ se:3 ] ) from a strictly quantum field theorist s point of view .",
    "finally we give some highlights on the `` vienna approach '' to 2d dilaton quantum gravity with matter , including a new result ( within that approach ) on entropy corrections which is in agreement with the one found in literature ( section [ se:4 ] ) . in that area which contains also models with physical relevance (",
    "e.g.  spherically reduced gravity ) the application of just the usual concepts of ( even nonpertubative ! )",
    "qft lead to very interesting consequences @xcite which allow physical interpretations in terms of `` solid '' traditional qft observables .",
    "physical observables in the sense used here are certain functionals of the field variables which are directly accessible to experimental measurements .",
    "the metric @xmath0 in gr can be considered as a `` derived '' field variable @xmath1 because it is the direct product of the dual basis one forms @xmath2 contracted with the flat local lorentz metric @xmath3 which is used to raise and lower `` flat indices '' denoted by latin letters ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "local lorentz invariance leads to the `` covariant derivative '' @xmath5 with a spin connection 1-form @xmath6 as a gauge field . its antisymmetry @xmath7 implies metricity .",

    "einstein gravity in d=4 dimensions postulates vanishing torsion @xmath17 so that @xmath18 .",
    "this theory can be derived from the hilbert action ( @xmath19 is newton s constant ; ds space results for nonvanishing cosmological constant @xmath20 from the replacement @xmath21 ) @xmath22 because of the `` palatini mystery '' , independent variation of @xmath23 yields @xmath24 whereas @xmath25 produces the einstein equations .    instead of working with the metric ( [ eq:1 ] ) the `` new '' approaches @xcite",
    "are based upon a gauge field related to @xmath26 @xmath27 the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath28 @xcite is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the extension to complex gravity @xmath29 makes @xmath30 a self - adjoint field and transforms the einstein theory into the one of an @xmath31 gauge field @xmath32 where the index @xmath33 this formulation is the basis of loop quantum gravity and spin foam models ( see below ) .      the exploration of the global properties of a certain solution of ( [ eq:2 ] ) , its singularity structure etc .",
    ", is only possible by means of the introduction of an additional test field , most simply a test particle with action @xmath34 which is another way to incorporate einstein s old proposal @xcite of a `` net of geodesics '' .",
    "the path @xmath35 is parameterized by the affine parameter @xmath36 ( actually only timelike or lightlike @xmath37 describes the paths of a physical particle ) .",
    "it is not appreciated always that the global properties of a manifold are _ defined _ in terms of a specific device like ( [ eq:5 ] ) . whereas the usual geodesics derived from ( [ eq:5 ] )",
    "depend on @xmath38 through the christoffel symbols only , e.g.  in the case of torsion also the contorsion may contribute ( `` autoparallels '' ) in the affine connection ; spinning particles `` feel '' the gravimagnetic effect etc . as a consequence , when a field dependent transformation of the gravity variables is performed ( e.g.  a conformal transformation from a `` jordan frame '' to an `` einstein frame '' in jordan - brans - dicke @xcite theory )",
    "the action of the device must be transformed in the same way .      in",
    "flat qft one starts from a schrdinger equation , dependent on field operators and , proceeding through hamiltonian quantization to the path integral , the experimentally accessible observables are the elements of the s - matrix , or quantities expressible by those .",
    "it should be recalled that the properly defined renormalized s - matrix element obtains by amputation of external propagators in the related green function , multiplication with polarizations and with a square root of the wave function renormalization constant , taking the mass - shell limit .    in gauge theories",
    "one encounters the additional problem of gauge - dependence , i.e.  the dependence on some gauge parameter @xmath39 introduced by generic gauge fixing .",
    "clearly the s - matrix elements must be and indeed are @xcite independent of @xmath39 .",
    "but other objects , in particular matrix - elements of gauge invariant operators @xmath40 , depend on @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , under renormalization they mix with operators @xmath41 of the same `` twist '' ( dimension minus spin ) which depend on faddeev - popov ghosts @xcite and are not gauge - invariant : @xmath42 the contribution of such operators to the s - matrix element ( sic ! ) of e.g.  the scaling limit for deep inelastic scattering @xcite of leptons on protons @xcite occurs only through the anomalous dimensions ( @xmath43 for a regularisation cut - off @xmath44 ) . and those objects , also thanks to the triangular form of ( [ eq:6 ] ) , are gauge - independent !    in flat qft , as well as in qgr , the ( gauge invariant ) `` wilson loop '' @xmath45 parameterized by a path ordered closed curve @xmath46 often is assumed to play an important role . in covariant gauges",
    "it is multiplicatively renormalizable with the renormalization constant depending on the length of @xmath47 , the uv cut - off and eventual cusp - angles in @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "still the relation to experimentally observable quantities ( should one simply drop the renormalization constant or proceed @xcite as for an s - matrix ? ) is unclear .",
    "worse , for lightlike axial gauges @xmath48 @xmath49 multiplicative renormalization is not applicable @xcite .",
    "then , only for a matrix element of ( [ eq:7 ] ) between `` on - shell gluons '' , this type of renormalization is restored .",
    "still the renormalization constant is different from covariant gauge , except for the anomalous dimension derived from it ( cf .",
    "precisely that feature of operators in deep inelastic scattering ) .",
    "`` old '' qgr worked with a separation of the two aspects of gravity variables by the decomposition of the metric @xmath50 which consists of a ( fixed ) classical background @xmath51 ( `` stage '' ) with small quantum fluctuations @xmath52 ( `` actors '' ) .",
    "the `` observable '' ( to be tested by a classical device ) would be the effective matrix @xmath53 starting computations from the action ( [ eq:2 ] ) one finds that an ever increasing number of counter - terms is necessary .",
    "they are different from the terms in the lagrangian @xmath54 in ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why qgr is called ( perturbatively ) `` nonrenormalizable '' @xcite .",
    "still , at energies e @xmath55 , i.e.  much below the planck mass scale @xmath56 , such calculations can be meaningful in the sense of an `` effective low energy field theory '' @xcite , irrespective of the fact that ( perhaps by embedding gravity into string theory ) by inclusion of further fields at higher energy scales ( planck scale ) , qgr may become renormalizable .",
    "of course , such an approach even when it is modified by iterative inclusion of @xmath57 into @xmath51 etc. which is technically quite hopeless  completely misses inherent background independent effects , i.e.  effects when @xmath58",
    ".    one could think also of applying nonperturbative methods developed in numerical lattice calculations for qcd . however , there are problems to define the euclidean path integral for that , because the euclidean action is not bounded from below ( as it is the case in qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the quantization of gravity which  at least in principle  avoids background dependence is based upon the adm approach to the dirac quantization of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "space - time is foliated by a sequence of three dimensional space - like manifolds @xmath59 upon which the variables @xmath60 and associated canonical momenta @xmath61 live .",
    "the constraints associated to the further variables lapse @xmath62 and shift @xmath63 in the hamiltonian density @xmath64 are primary ones .",
    "the poisson brackets of the secondary constraints @xmath65 closes .",
    "@xmath66 generates diffeomorphisms on @xmath59 . in the quantum version of ( [ eq:9 ] ) the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation involving the hamiltonian constraint @xmath67",
    "formally would correspond to a nonperturbative qgr .",
    "apart from the fact that it is extremely difficult to find a general solution to ( [ eq:10 ] ) there are several basic problems with a quantum theory based upon that equation ( e.g.  no hilbert space @xmath68 can be constructed , no preferred time foliation exists with ensuing inequivalent quantum evolutions @xcite , problems with usual `` quantum causality '' exist , the `` axiom '' that fields should commute at space like distances does not hold etc . ) . a restriction to a finite number of degrees of freedom ( `` mini superspace '' ) @xcite or infinite number of degrees of freedom ( but still less than the original theory ",
    "so - called `` midi superspace '' ) @xcite has been found to miss essential features .",
    "as all physical states @xmath68 must be annihilated by the constraints @xmath65 , a naive schrdinger equation involving the hamiltonian constraint @xmath69 , @xmath70 can not contain a time variable ( `` problem of time '' ) .",
    "a kind of schrdinger equation can be produced by the definition of a `` time - function '' @xmath71 , at the price of an even more complicated formalism @xcite with quite ambiguous results  and the problem , how to connect those with `` genuine '' observables .",
    "all these problems are aggravated , when one tries to first eliminate constraints by solving them explicitly before quantization . in this way , clearly part of the quantum fluctuations are eliminated from the start . as a consequence",
    "different quantum theories , constructed in this way , are not equivalent .",
    "the `` new '' gravities ( loop quantum gravity , spin foam models ) reformulate the quantum theory of space - time by the introduction of novel variables , based upon the concept of wilson loops ( [ eq:7 ] ) applied to the gauge - field ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath72 defines a holonomy .",
    "it is generalized by inserting further invariant operators at intermediate points between @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from such holonomies",
    "a spin network can be created which represents spacetime ( in the path integral it is dubbed `` spin foam '' ) .",
    "these approaches claim several successes @xcite . introducing as a basis diffeomorphism equivalence classes of `` labeled graphs '' a finite hilbert space can be constructed and some solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) have been obtained .",
    "the methods introduce a `` natural '' coarse graining of space - time which implies a @xmath75 cutoff .",
    "`` small '' gravity around certain states leads in those cases to corresponding linearized einstein gravity .    however",
    ", despite of very active research in this field a number of very serious open questions persists : the hamiltonian constructed from spin networks does not lead to massless excitations ( gravitons ) in the classical limit .",
    "the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath28 has to be fixed by the requirement of a `` correct '' bekenstein - hawking entropy for the black hole .",
    "the most severe problem , however , is the one of observables . by some researchers in this field",
    "it has been claimed that by `` proper gauge fixing '' ( ! ) area and volume can be obtained as quantized `` observables '' , which is a contradiction in itself from the point of view of qft .",
    "we must emphasize too that also in an inherently @xmath75 regularized theory ( finite ) renormalization remains an issue to be dealt with properly .",
    "also the fate of s - matrix elements , which play such a central role as the proper observables in qft , is completely unclear in these setups .",
    "embedding qgr into ( super-)string theory @xcite does not remove the key problems related to the dual role of the metric .",
    "gravity may well be a string excitation in a string / brane world of 10 - 11 dimensions , possibly a finite theory of everything .",
    "nevertheless , at low energies einstein gravity ( eventually plus an antisymmetric @xmath76-field ) remains the theory for which computations must be performed .",
    "unfortunately , the proper choice ( let alone the derivation ) of a string vacuum in our d=4 space - time is an unsolved problem .",
    "many other approaches exist , including noncommutative geometry , twistors , causal sets , 3d approaches , dynamical triangulations , regge calculus etc . , each of which has certain attractive features and difficulties ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite and refs .  therein ) .    to us",
    "all these `` new '' approaches appear as  very ingenious ",
    "attempts to bypass the technical problems of directly applying standard qft to gravity  without a comprehensive solution of the main problems of qgr being in sight .",
    "thus the main points of a `` minimal '' qft for gravity should be based upon `` proven concepts '' of qft with a point of departure characterizing qgr as follows :    * qgr is an `` effective '' low energy theory and therefore need not be renormalizable to all orders .",
    "* qgr is based upon classical einstein ( -ds ) gravity with usual variables ( metric or cartan variables ) .",
    "* at least the quantization of geometry must be performed in a background independent ( nonperturbative ) way . *",
    "absolutely `` safe '' quantum observables are only the s - matrix elements of qft @xmath77 , where initial state @xmath78 and final state @xmath79 are defined only when those states are realized as fock states of particles in a ( at least approximate ) flat space environment . in certain cases",
    "it is permissible to employ a semi - classical approach : expectation values of quantum corrections may be added to classical geometric variables , and a classical computation is then based on the effective variables , obtained in this way .",
    "clearly item ( d ) by construction excludes any application to quantum cosmology , where @xmath80 would be the ( probably nonexistent ) infinite past before the big bang .",
    "obviously the most difficult issue is ( c ) .",
    "we describe in the following section how gravity models in d=2 ( e.g.  spherically reduced gravity ) permit a solution of just that crucial point , leading to novel results .",
    "in the 1990s the interest in dilaton gravity in d=2 was rekindled by results from string theory @xcite , but it existed as a field on its own more or less since the 1980s @xcite . for a review on dilaton gravity ref .",
    "@xcite may be consulted . for sake of self - containment",
    "the study of dilaton gravity will be motivated briefly from a purely geometrical point of view .    the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite is used : @xmath81 is the zweibein one - form , @xmath82 is the volume two - form .",
    "the one - form @xmath83 represents the spin - connection @xmath84 with the totally antisymmetric levi - civit symbol @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) . with the flat metric @xmath3 in light - cone coordinates ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) the torsion 2-form reads @xmath89 .",
    "the curvature 2-form @xmath90 can be presented by the 2-form @xmath91 defined by @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "signs and factors of the hodge-@xmath94 operation are defined by @xmath95 .    since the hilbert action @xmath96 yields just the euler number for a surface with genus @xmath0 one has to generalize it appropriately .",
    "the simplest idea is to introduce a lagrange multiplier for curvature , @xmath97 , also known as `` dilaton field '' , and an arbitrary potential thereof , @xmath98 , in the action @xmath99 . in particular , for @xmath100 the jackiw - teitelboim model emerges @xcite .",
    "having introduced curvature it is natural to consider torsion as well . by analogy the first order gravity action @xcite can be motivated where @xmath101 are the lagrange multipliers for torsion .",
    "it encompasses essentially all known dilaton theories in 2d , also known as generalized dilaton theories ( gdt ) .",
    "spherically reduced gravity ( srg ) from d=4 corresponds to @xmath102 .    without matter",
    "there are no physical propagating degrees of freedom , which is advantageous mathematically but not very attractive from a physical point of view .",
    "thus , in order to describe scattering processes matter has to be added .",
    "the simplest way is to consider a massless klein - gordon field @xmath103 , with a coupling function @xmath104 depending on the dilaton ( for dimensionally reduced theories typically @xmath105 holds ) .",
    "it turned out that even in the presence of matter an exact path integration of all geometric quantities is possible for all gdts , proceeding along well established paths of qft @xcite .",
    "the effective theory obtained in this way solely depends on the matter fields in which it is nonlocal and non - polynomial . already at the level of the ( nonlocal ) vertices of matter fields , to be used in a systematic perturbative expansion in terms of newton s constant",
    ", a highly nontrivial and physically intriguing phenomenon can be observed , namely the so - called `` virtual black hole '' ( vbh ) .",
    "this notion originally has been introduced by s. hawking @xcite , but in our recent approach the vbh for srg emerges naturally in minkowski signature space - time , without the necessity of additional _ ad hoc _ assumptions",
    ".    for non - minimally coupled scalars the lowest order s - matrix indeed exhibited interesting features : forward scattering poles , monomial scaling with energy , cpt invariance , and pseudo - self - similarity in its kinematic sector @xcite .",
    "it was possible to reconstruct geometry self - consistently from a ( perturbative or , if available , exact ) solution of the effective theory .",
    "for the simplest case of four - point tree - graph scattering the corresponding carter - penrose ( cp ) diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] .",
    "it is non - local in the sense that it depends not only on one set of coordinates but on two .",
    "this was a consequence of integrating out geometry non - perturbatively . for each choice of @xmath106 ( one of the two sets of coordinates ) it is possible to draw an ordinary cp - diagram .",
    "the non - trivial part of our effective geometry ( i.e.the vbh ) is concentrated on the light - like cut . for srg",
    "the ensuing line - element has sachs - bondi form @xmath107 with @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 being localized on the cut @xmath111 with compact support @xmath112 .",
    "these quantities depend on the second set of coordinates @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "one should not take the effective geometry at face value  this would be like over - interpreting the role of virtual particles in a loop diagram .",
    "it is a nonlocal entity and one still has to `` sum '' ( read : integrate ) over all possible geometries of this type in order to obtain the nonlocal vertices and the scattering amplitude .",
    "nonetheless , the simplicity of this geometry and the fact that all possible configurations are summed over are nice features of this picture .",
    "moreover , all vbh geometries coincide asymptotically and differ only very little from each other in the asymptotic region .",
    "this observation allows for the following interpretation : the boundaries of the diagram , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , behave in a classical way ( thus enabling one to construct an ordinary fock space like in fixed background qft ) , but the more one zooms into the geometry the less classical it becomes .",
    "the situation seems to be quite contrary to kucha s proposal of geometrodynamics of bhs : while we have fixed boundary conditions for the target space coordinates ( and hence a fixed adm mass ) but a `` smeared geometry '' ( in the sense that a continuous spectrum of asymptotically equivalent vbhs contributes to the s - matrix ) , kucha encountered a `` smeared mass '' ( obeying a schrdinger equation ) but an otherwise fixed geometry @xcite .",
    "qualitatively it is clear what has to be done in order to obtain the s - matrix : take all possible vbhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] and sum them coherently with proper weight factors and suitably attached external legs of scalar fields .",
    "this had been done quantitatively in a straightforward but rather lengthy calculation for gravitational scattering of s - waves in the framework of srg , the result of which yielded the lowest order tree - graph s - matrix for ingoing modes with momenta @xmath117 and outgoing ones @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the momentum transfer function @xmath122 . the interesting part of the scattering amplitude is encoded in the scale independent factor @xmath123 .",
    "the forward scattering poles occurring for @xmath124 should be noted .",
    "it is possible to generalize the vbh phenomenon to arbitrary gdts with matter as well as most of its properties ( for instance , the cp - diagram , cpt invariance and the role played in the s - matrix ) @xcite .",
    "recently quantum corrections to the specific heat of the dilaton bh have been calculated by applying the quantization method discussed above @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the scale parameter of the theory .",
    "thus , in that particular case quantum corrections lead to a stabilization of the system .",
    "the mass of the bh is found to be decreasing according to the first term is the adm mass , the second term corresponds to a linear decrease due to the ( in leading order ) constant hawking flux and the third term provides the first nontrivial correction .",
    "applying simple thermodynamical methods ( @xmath127 ) and exploiting the quantum corrected mass / temperature relation @xmath128 it is possible to calculate also entropy corrections : the logarithmic behavior is in qualitative agreement with the one found in the literature by various methods @xcite ; the prefactor @xmath129 coincides with @xcite .",
    "an extension of the results obtained in the first order formulation to dilaton supergravity is straightforward in principle but somewhat tedious in detail .",
    "it permitted , among other results , to obtain for the first time a full solution of dilaton supergravity @xcite .",
    "all these exciting applications indicate that the strict application of standard qft concepts to gravity ( at least in d=2 or in models dimensionally reduced to d=2 ) shows great promise .",
    "this work has been supported by project p-14650-tph of the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) and by euresco .",
