    "<S> it is known that the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of a partially coherent vortex ( pcv ) beam shows a robust link with the radial and azimuthal mode indices . </S>",
    "<S> however , the previous proposals are difficult to measure the ccf in practical system , especially in the case of astronomical objects . in this letter , we demonstrate experimentally that the hanbury brown and twiss effect can be used to measure the mode indices of the original vortex beam and investigate the relationship between the spatial coherent width and the characterization of ccf of a pcv beam . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite pointed out that beam with spiral phase distribution of @xmath0 carries an orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an integer which denotes the azimuthal mode index ( topological charge ) , and @xmath3 is the azimuthal coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> beam with this kind of phase structure is also called vortex beam . </S>",
    "<S> vortex beam has been widely studied in the last two decades and found a lot of applications , such as optical tweezers @xcite , spiral phase contrast microscopy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the values of @xmath2 is theoretically unlimited , oam states construct an infinite dimensional hilbert space , and it exhibits great potential for applications in the field of quantum information process@xcite , free - space information transfer and communications@xcite . despite the extensive applications , determining the topological charge @xmath2 of oam state remains an intriguing problem , and a lot of methods has been proposed . such as mach - zehnder interferometer@xcite , diffraction pattern with specific masks@xcite , image reformatting@xcite , intensity analysis@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> when the size of pcv beam is large compared to the measuring instrument , their scheme is difficult be used to measure the cross - correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the interference pattern in their results is complex and the visibility is low , which is difficult to characterize the mode indices from the experimental results . in this letter , we experimentally prove that the mode indices of a pcv beam can be measured efficiently through a hanbury brown and twiss ( hbt ) type experiment which was firstly used in the field of astronomy @xcite .    </S>",
