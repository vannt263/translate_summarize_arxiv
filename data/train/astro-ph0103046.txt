    "it has long been recognised that the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) effect in clusters of galaxies , along with x - ray measurements , can provide a method of measuring distances on cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "the method takes advantage of the differing dependences on the cluster electron density @xmath5 and temperature @xmath6 of the x - ray bremsstrahlung ( @xmath7 ) and sz effect ( @xmath8 ) to measure the physical size of the cluster , and hence its angular - diameter distance .",
    "the dependence of the derived value of @xmath0 on the important quantities is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sz brightness decrement , @xmath11 is the x - ray surface brightness , @xmath12 is the apparent angular size of the cluster , and @xmath13 is the ratio of the linear sizes of the cluster perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the systematic effects in this method of measuring @xmath0 are quite different from those in other methods , either in the traditional distance ladder or in other direct physical methods such as gravitational lensing , and are mostly due to the difficulty of modelling the cluster gas that causes both the sz effect and the x - ray emission .",
    "recent work has shown that the small - scale features in the gas distribution such as cooling flows or clumping contribute smaller biases than might have been thought , since the effects on the observed quantities entering @xmath0 tend to cancel each other even for a single cluster ( eg , grainger , maggi et al . ) . however , the large - scale distribution of the gas poses a problem , since the line - of - sight depth through the cluster can not be measured directly , and has to be assumed to be the same as the size of the cluster in the plane of the sky .",
    "this asumption will be violated if clusters are chosen preferentially because of high surface brightness , since this will favour clusters that are extended along the line of sight .",
    "this will bias low the derived value of @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore need a cluster sample that is selected on total flux rather than surface brightness , well above the surface brightness limit of the survey .",
    "although several individual @xmath0 estimates from the sz / x - ray method have been published ( eg @xcite ) , properly selected cluster samples are only recently beginning to emerge @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive a sample of moderate - redshift x - ray - selected clusters that is carefully controlled to be free of any orientation bias , and use it to calculate @xmath0 using the sz data from the ryle telescope ( rt ) .    unless stated otherwise , we assume a standard cold dark matter cosmology ( scdm , @xmath14 ) .",
    "we also give our results assuming a @xmath15cdm cosmology ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the most complete x - ray cluster samples suitable for our purpose are selected from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "we use two such samples , the bright cluster sample ( bcs ) @xcite , and northern rosat all - sky survey ( noras ) @xcite .",
    "we began selection of our sz sample from bcs while it was being compiled ; we use noras as a consistency check .",
    "both surveys are based on cluster candidates found in the first processing ( sass ) of the rass data , with further tests to check they are indeed clusters .",
    "a problem , particularly for clusters at high redshift , is the risk of incompleteness for compact clusters that may not appear extended enough to be recognised as such .",
    "bcs attempts to overcome this problem by adding known abell and zwicky clusters to the sample .",
    "however , comparing the bcs and noras samples after applying our rt selection criteria , it turns out that our sample is not affected by differences between the bcs and noras secondary selections .",
    "the flux limit of noras is @xmath17 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 at 90% completeness ; that of bcs is @xmath20 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 to the same completeness .",
    "but we limit our sample to even higher fluxes , of greater than @xmath21 erg s@xmath18 @xmath19 ( see figure  [ fig : noras_sample ] ) .",
    "both this and a restriction to redshifts @xmath22 help reduce the risk of missing compact clusters . in accordance with the requirements for the ryle telescope",
    "we restrict our sample to the northern sky at declinations @xmath23 20@xmath24 , to a redshift range of @xmath25 , and luminosities of @xmath26 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "table [ table : sample ] lists the clusters from bcs and from noras that meet these criteria , and also indicates those which have radio sources that would make sz measurement difficult or impossible . where the surveys disagree on whether a cluster should be included on grounds of flux",
    ", we cautiously select only those clusters that meet our criteria in both surveys : this excludes three clusters above our flux limits in bcs and not in noras , and one in noras but not in bcs .",
    "this is consistent with the errors in the flux estimates in each survey .",
    "two bcs - selected clusters are not in noras , consistent with the inclusion of optically selected clusters in bcs that are not in noras due to lack of extent . of the eleven clusters satisfying our x - ray criteria , six have radio sources in the cluster or within the field of view of the rt that are too bright at 15  ghz to allow sz observation with the rt .",
    "we have observed the remaining five , a697 , a773 , a1413 , a1914 and a2218 with the rt and obtained detections for all of them ; the results are discussed below . since the presence of radio sources can not be correlated with cluster orientation , this subsample is effectively randomly chosen , and therefore retains the orientation - independence of the whole sample .",
    "indeed , we have checked that the our subsample is not correlated to x - ray properties such as flux , extent likelihood and measured extent .",
    "it therefore appears unlikely that any significant bias , larger than the random error , is present in our averaged @xmath0 result .",
    "clearly a larger sample would improve matters : the small size of our sample highlights the difficulty of selecting rigorously at moderately high redshift , even using the best large - area x - ray surveys available .",
    "details of our observational and modelling methods are given in grainge et al .",
    ", grainge et al . and grainger et al .",
    "we briefly summarise them here .    in each case",
    "we fit the _ rosat _ pspc or hri image using an ellipsoidal @xmath27-model , with @xmath27 , the core radii in the plane of the sky , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the position angle of the major axis , the position on the sky , and the central electron density @xmath30 all as free parameters .",
    "the core radius in the line of sight is set to the geometric mean of the other two .",
    "a downhill simplex method is used to maximise the likelihood of the data given the model , using poisson statistics . for the pspc images we use the hard band ( 0.52 kev ) in order to minimise the effect of galactic absorption .",
    "we remove contaminating radio sources by a maximum likelihood fit to the visibility data , simultaneously fitting the sz decrement ( using the x - ray - determined model , with a variable amplitude ) and the sources .",
    "we include trial sources at all positions suggested either from the long baseline rt data or from other observations such as nvss @xcite , and allow their positions and fluxes to vary in the fit .",
    "this allows us to remove the effects of sources whose existence is known from lower - frequency observations but whose brightness would not warrant a significant detection from the rt data alone .",
    "finally we take the source - subtracted data and compare them with mock sz data derived from the x - ray model , taking into account the full response of the rt .",
    "we vary the normalisation of the mock data ( equivalent to varying @xmath0 ) and find the likelihood of the data , and then multiply by a prior that is uniform in log space ( since @xmath0 is a scale parameter ) to find the peak and extent of the posterior probability distribution .",
    "we then apply corrections for the more exact relativistic form of the compton @xmath31 parameter @xcite , and small time - dependant variations from the nominal rt flux calibration scale ( determined from vla monitoring of our primary flux calibrators , 3c48 and 3c286 ) , as well as adding in ( in quadrature ) estimates of the other main sources of error .",
    "we now give details of the procedure for each of the five clusters .",
    "two have been published more fully elsewhere ( a773 , saunders et al . and a1413 , grainge et al . ) and are briefly summarised here ; one ( a2218 ) is a re - analysis of previously published data @xcite ; the other two ( a697 and a1914 ) are new .",
    "a697 was observed with the _ rosat _ hri on 1995 november 6 with a live time of 28.1 ks .",
    "we also observed it using asca during 1996 april in order to determine its temperature .",
    "analysing both the gis and sis data using standard xspec tools , we find a temperature of @xmath32 kev ( 68% confidence ) , with a metallicity of @xmath33 solar .",
    "fitting to the _ rosat _ hri data , we find the parameters given in table [ table : xray ] .",
    "the hri image , model and residuals are shown in figure [ fig : xray - model ] .",
    "we observed a697 with the rt on 42 occasions between 1994 august 6 and 1996 april 27 .",
    "the map of all the data is shown in figure [ fig : a697 ] .",
    "the bright source to the nw is extended , but can be successfully modelled as three point sources .",
    "fitting simultaneously to the sources and sz decrement gives a good fit with the source parameters listed in table [ table : sources ] .",
    "fitting the source - subtracted data to the model derived from the x - ray data ( figure [ fig : visplots ] ) , and applying the relativistic and flux - scale corrections , we find @xmath34 ( errors from sz fitting only ) . including the other errors , dominated by the x - ray temperature ( @xmath35 ) and ellipticity ( @xmath36 )",
    ", we find @xmath37 . for a @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "this becomes @xmath40 .",
    "details of the determination of @xmath0 from a773 are given in saunders et al . .",
    "we used a _",
    "hri image and a temperature measurement from asca in conjunction with our rt data to estimate a value of @xmath41 for scdm , @xmath42 for @xmath15cdm .",
    "details for a1413 are given by grainge et al .",
    ", who also discuss the contributions to the @xmath0 error budget in general . using a _ rosat _ pspc image and asca temperature , we find @xmath43 for scdm , @xmath44 for @xmath15cdm .",
    "a1914 was observed with the _ rosat _ pspc for 8.6 ks in 1992 july .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence to suggest that a1914 is undergoing a merger .",
    "the _ rosat _ image ( see figure [ fig : a1914 ] ) shows significant substructure in the core of the cluster , but no evidence of a cooling flow .",
    "the temperature , measured from an asca observation , is rather high at @xmath45 kev .",
    "the poss optical image shows two distinct groups of galaxies with no single dominant galaxy , and finally there is a diffuse steep - spectrum radio source to the ne of the cluster centre that is detected in the wenss ( 300 mhz ) @xcite and nvss ( 1.4 ghz ) surveys .",
    "this raises the question of whether a1914 should be included in our sample , since it is possible that the cluster gas might be far from hydrostatic equilibrium and difficult to model .",
    "we choose to include it in our sample since simulations @xcite show that even including clusters with large internal kinetic energies in their gas does not bias the sample average @xmath0 however , such clusters can have a large scatter about the mean value  this does appear to be the case with a1914 and also with a2218 .",
    "we fitted a @xmath27 model to the _ rosat _ pspc image with the parameters given in table [ table : xray ] .",
    "the residuals ( see figure [ fig : xray - model ] ) were noticeably poorer than those from the fits to other clusters such as a1413 ; a monte carlo analysis shows that the hypothesis that the true structure is a @xmath27 model and that the features seen result from poisson noise can be rejected at the 4-@xmath46 level .",
    "a1914 was observed with the rt on 19 occasions between 1996 march 6 and april 16 ; the full resolution radio image is shown in figure [ fig : a1914 ] .",
    "there are clearly several radio sources near the cluster centre , some of which are also detected in a vla image ( figure [ fig : a1914 ] ) .",
    "we used the vla source positions and positions from a long - baseline rt image to estimate the fluxes of nine sources ; the fluxes found and subtracted are shown in table [ table : sources ] .",
    "fitting the source - subtracted short - baseline data to the x - ray - based model ( figure [ fig : visplots ] ) results in a value of @xmath47 with errors just from the sz fitting , and @xmath48 including the other sources of error . for @xmath15cdm",
    "this becomes @xmath49 .",
    "a2218 was the first cluster to be observed in the rt sz programme @xcite , and has also been extensively observed in many wavebands , with sz detections in the radio ( eg birkinshaw & hughes  ) as well as strong and weak lensing observations ( eg kneib et al .",
    "and squires et al .  ) and x - ray studies ( eg markevitch  ) .",
    "we have previously reported a measurement of @xmath0 from this cluster @xcite ; we re - analyse our data here because we have improved our source - subtraction and modelling techniques , and because a new temperature measurement from asca is available that supersedes the previous ginga measurement .",
    "figure [ fig : a2218 ] shows the image made by combining 30 days rt data taken in two array configurations between 1992 december 4 and 1993 march 23 .",
    "this map has simply been cleaned with no source subtraction ; nevertheless , even at this high resolution the sz decrement is clearly visible , and an approximate calculation of the observed temperature decrement , using the clean restoring beam size of @xmath50 , gives a maximum decrement of @xmath51k .",
    "this agrees well with the fitted @xmath27-model central temperature of @xmath52k .",
    "we used the _ rosat _ pspc observation made on 1991 may 25 , which has a live time of 42.47  ks .",
    "the x - ray model fitting parameters are shown in table [ table : xray ] . as with a1914 , the x - ray image contains substructure that is significantly different from a smooth ellipsoidal @xmath27 model ( see figure [ fig : xray - model ] ) .",
    "preliminary source subtraction in the map plane had shown that , of the three bright sources evident in figure [ fig : a2218 ] , the central one was point - like but the eastern and western sources had some additional extended flux .",
    "we therefore fitted a total of six trial sources , modelling the western source as three points and the eastern source as two .",
    "this gave a good fit to the data with the source parameters listed in table [ table : sources ] .",
    "subtracting these sources and fitting to the x - ray model ( using an asca - derived temperature of @xmath53 kev @xcite ) , we find a best fit value of @xmath54 , where these errors only include the sz fitting . including the other dominant sources of error ( @xmath55 from the temperature measurement and @xmath56 from the likely ellipticity ) , we find @xmath57 , or @xmath58 for @xmath15cdm .",
    "the values of @xmath0 derived from each cluster are summarised in in table [ table : h0 ] .",
    "since the main sources of error in each value are in the form of a multiplicative factor , we calculate the sample mean by taking a weighted average of @xmath59 .",
    "the result is @xmath60 for scdm or @xmath61 for @xmath15cdm .",
    "looking at the scatter in our individual values , we see that a697 , a773 and a1413 all agree with the mean within 1-@xmath46 .",
    "a1914 is 1.6 @xmath46 above the mean and a2218 is 2.8 @xmath46 below it .",
    "these are the two clusters for which there is independent evidence , from the lack of a good fit of the x - ray model and from the optical galaxy distribution , of significant dynamical activity .",
    "since our error estimate does not include a component to take account of this effect ( for lack of a means of quantifiying it ) , it is not suprising that the scatter appears anomalously large .",
    "nevertheless we feel justified in keeping these two clusters in the sample based on the evidence from simulations that dynamically active clusters do not bias the value of @xmath0  indeed , removing them does not significantly change the best estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "we have used _ rosat _ and asca x - ray data and ryle telescope sz observations to measure the hubble constant @xmath0 from a sample of five clusters , selected using the bcs and noras cluster catalogues to be free of orientation bias .",
    "the weighted geometric mean value of @xmath0 from this sample is @xmath1 assuming a standard cdm model with @xmath2 , or @xmath3 if @xmath4 .",
