    "spin-@xmath9 kagome magnets have attracted intense attention due to their ability to host exotic magnetism induced by geometric frustration . in classical systems , such as the @xmath10 jarosites and scgo ( srcr@xmath3ga@xmath11o@xmath12 ) minerals ,",
    "this often leads to spin liquid or spin glass properties @xcite . in the quantum limit , @xmath0 ,",
    "kagome magnets are the most promising model system to observe quantum spin liquids ( qsls ) in 2-dimensions .",
    "these states are of tremendous interest as they could underpin a range of exotic electronic properties , such as the transition to high - temperature superconductivity in the doped cuprates @xcite .",
    "whilst this attractive phenomena drove initial research in these materials , the richness of the @xmath0 kagome phase diagram has been revealed with the discovery of new experimental model materials : the copper vanadate minerals vesignieite and volborthite display various magnetic phases from incommensurate order to heterogeneous static and dynamic spin states @xcite ; in paratacamite - based materials fractional excitations have been observed in herbertsmithite @xcite , whilst kapellasite and haydeeite both lie in close proximity to a chiral qsl state @xcite . beyond these well known materials ,",
    "the recent discovery of multiferroicity in kcu@xmath1as@xmath2o@xmath13(od)@xmath1 further exemplifies the range of behaviours possible in @xmath0 kagome magnets , whilst also highlighting their potential as functional materials @xcite .",
    "research into the detailed properties of @xmath0 kagome magnets has so far concentrated on spin - only models and the consequences of orbital physics has largely been unconsidered .",
    "in contrast , the vast majority of experimental model materials are based on moment - bearing @xmath14 transition metals , which in octahedral geometries possess singly - occupied and doubly - degenerate @xmath5 orbitals , and so are jahn - teller ( jt ) active .",
    "such orbitally - active transition metal materials are often described by kugel - khomskii ( kk)-type models , where orbital superexchange terms must be included to satisfactorily describe the observed physics @xcite , and are exemplified by the material kcuf@xmath1 @xcite . while these orbital and spin components often operate at drastically different energy scales , when they are of similar energies they may couple to form a modified hamiltonian that necessarily has directional dependence following the anisotropy of orbital space @xcite . when combined with spin frustration and quantum effects , such as can arise in @xmath0 kagome magnets , the orbital frustration associated with orbital degeneracy is predicted to enhance quantum fluctuations and stabilise a quantum spin - orbital liquid ( qsol ) @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies have begun to explore such ground states , such as in ba@xmath1cusb@xmath2o@xmath15 @xcite and lasrvo@xmath11 @xcite which show suppression of both orbital and spin ordering through geometric frustration . as of yet no model qsol materials based on @xmath0 kagome magnets have been studied and we argue that their ability to possess geometric and orbital frustration make them ideal templates to further investigate quantum spin - orbital frustration .",
    "in this paper we re - evaluate the crystal structure of vesignieite following a new synthesic route to high - quality samples , and find it consistent with orbital frustration of the @xmath5 @xmath6-orbitals of the cu@xmath7 and a dynamic jahn - teller ( jt ) effect .",
    "this frustration occurs on a sublattice of the cu kagome network and persists to @xmath16k , well below the suppressed magnetic transition at 9k .",
    "a combination of crystallographic strain analysis and magnetic susceptibility measurements suggests a strong magnetostructural coupling , related to the complex jt effect , that may explain the varied magnetic behaviour observed between samples .",
    "importantly , these results call for re - analysis of several cu@xmath7 kagome magnets to include orbital physics and opens up several possibilities of exploring spin - orbital frustration in vesignieite and other related minerals .",
    "the new synthetic route for vesignieite was adapted from that used for ` sr - vesignieite ' @xcite , whereby the layered copper vanadate mineral volborthite , cu@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath13(oh)@xmath17h@xmath2o , is used as a starting reagent .",

    "the sealed bomb was heated from room temperature to 200@xmath20c at a rate of 1@xmath20c / min and left for 24hours before being removed from the furnace and left to cool naturally .",

    "although this value is relatively low , rietveld refinement of the oxygen positions for all datasets proved unstable , likely due to the presence of several heavy elements , and therefore a full structural refinement was impossible .",
    "consequently , we limit our discussion to pawley refinements and crystallite strain analysis .",
    "these analyses were performed using the topas software package @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the synchrotron data collected from samples 1 , 2 - 0 and 2 - 168 is shown in figure 1a .",
    "the diffraction pattern of sample 1 has several peaks that can not be indexed with the @xmath26 monoclinic structure previously reported for vesignieite @xcite , most notably at @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "instead the pattern indexes with the trigonal @xmath4 structure recently reported for ` sr - vesignieite ' and a pawley refinement starting with the unit cell from the latter material fits the data excellently and accounts for all observed peaks @xcite .",
    "data collected on the samples 2 - 0 and 2 - 168 have a noticeably higher background and many of the peaks associated with the @xmath4 structure are not visible . however , the peak at @xmath22@xmath23 is visible in the spectra of sample 2 - 168 , although it is significantly broadened , particularly with respect to the rest of the pattern .",
    "figure 1b shows a powder x - ray diffraction spectrum taken on a hydrothermally annealed sample made by yoshida _",

    "the observation of a crystalline impurity meant that small features were either ignored or assigned to the impurity phase , thus the monoclinic structure was assumed to be correct and no re - analysis of the structure was performed .",
    "unfortunately , this structure can not be reconciled with that of @xmath28-vesignieite where rhombohedral @xmath29 symmetry is determined from single crystal diffraction @xcite .",
    "we note that these crystals were synthesised hydrothermally , similarly to samples 2 - 0 through 2 - 168 here , and therefore the additional peaks may have been broad and again not indexed in that study .",

    "a two - phase refinement model was used : one phase with monoclinic @xmath26 symmetry and another with trigonal @xmath4 .",
    "the profile of both phases were independently modelled with a simple convolution of gaussian and lorentzian peakshapes , parameters cs_g and cs_l in topas respectively , the values of which correlate with particle size .",
    "these profile parameters were allowed to refine freely in the pawley refinements and the same procedure was used for data collected on samples 2 - 0 , 2 - 2 , 2 - 6 , 2 - 24 and 2 - 72 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a plot of the gaussian profile parameter for the @xmath4 phase , cs_g , as a function of annealing time is shown in figure 2a .",
    "the larger cs_g value with longer annealing time is a result of the sharper profile function for the @xmath4 phase , hence the additional peaks visible in the data collected on sample 2 - 168 .",
    "an important feature of the pawley refinements is that even for sample 2 - 0 where the @xmath4 phase profile is broad , the two phase model significantly improves the fit in the regions of the additional peaks due to the large background .",
    "evidently this anisotropic profile broadening is strictly sample related and is commonly caused by microstructural properties such as defects , dislocations and stacking faults @xcite .    to further characterise the structural disorder , size and strain properties were determined from williamson - hall plots @xcite .",
    "this method assumes that the sample broadening of each peak associated with a reflection is a simple convolution of crystallite size and lattice strain , where both vary differently as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , the total internal breadth of each peak , @xmath31 , is given by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the internal breadths of the size and strain broadening , @xmath28 and @xmath35 , respectively .",

    "@xmath31 for sample 2 - 0 appears to have no relation to @xmath36 , rendering a straight - line fit impossible and suggesting significant anisotropic strain and size effects .",
    "after hydrothermal annealing for 7days , the majority of @xmath31 values fall approximately onto a straight line , except for those associated with the @xmath40 reflections .",
    "these lie above the fit indicating that they are more strained . taking into account all reflections , the fitted size component , @xmath30 , increases as a function of annealing time ( figure 2b inset ) showing an improved sample crystallinity .",

    "these orientations , along with the bond length variation observed in the refined bond lengths ( table 1 ) is consistent with static and dynamic jahn - teller order on the cu1 and cu2 sites , respectively.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      to obtain accurate atomic positions for the @xmath4 structure of sample 1 , powder neutron diffraction data were collected at the high - resolution powder diffraction ( hrpd ) beamline at isis , uk .",
    "2.7 g of sample was loaded in a standard rectangular geometry vanadium holder of 10 mm depth .",
    "data were collected at 4 and 20k using a standard orange cryostat for durations of 7h at each temperature .",
    "rietveld refinement of the data was performed using the topas software package @xcite , with a starting atomic model adapted from ` sr - vesignieite ' @xcite but with lattice parameters taken from the pawley refinements of the synchrotron data discussed previously .",
    "the final refinement of the data collected at 4k achieved goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath41 .    to further characterise the jt states of the cu@xmath7 sites , refinement of anisotropic displacement parameters on the octahedral oxygen sites",
    "was attempted , however these proved unstable and so alternative refinement techniques were required .",
    "the most stable approach involved first performing a thorough rietveld analysis whereby the positions and isotropic displacements of all atomic positions were refined , bar the vanadium which was fixed to that from the ` sr - vesignieite ' structure .",
    "once convergence was achieved , the oxygen sites of the cuo@xmath42 octahedra were split , and set to half occupancy , with the position of each allowed to refine freely and the isotropic displacements of all split oxygens fixed to be equal . for the data collected at @xmath16k , this procedure lowered the @xmath43 and @xmath44 values from 3.732 to 3.617 and 2.372 to 2.274 , respectively .",
    "the refined crystal structure of vesignieite at @xmath16k , shown in figure 3a with refined structural parameters in table s1 , closely resembles that of ` sr - vesignieite ' .",
    "the larger ba@xmath7 ion in vesignieite causes an enlargement of the unit cell ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) compared to its sr@xmath7-analogue .",
    "moreover , vesignieite shows the same pattern of axially compressed and rhombically distorted cuo@xmath42 octahedra that has been found in ` sr - vesignieite ' , as shown in figure 3b .",
    "looking at the axially - compressed cu2 site , we note firstly that this geometry is surprisingly rare , and that the observation of axially compressed cu@xmath7 by powder diffraction can be explained in the vast majority of cases by a dynamic jt state involving the re - orientation of an _ axially elongated _ coordination geometry@xcite . in vesignieite the split o11 and o13 sites",
    "are approximately aligned parallel to the cu2o11/o13 bonds ( figure 3b ) .",
    "these o11 and o13 sites are shared between neighbouring cu1 and cu2 octahedra , however they are arranged approximately perpendicular to the cu1o11/o13 bonds .",
    "evidence for this is found in the difference between the cu ",
    "o bond lengths of the split oxygen sites : the cu2o11/o13 bonds differ by 0.29(6)  ( @xmath47% ) and 0.38(4)  ( @xmath48% ) , respectively , whilst the cu1o11/o13 differ by significantly less : 0.08(7)  ( @xmath49% ) and 0.13(4)  ( @xmath50% ) , respectively ( table 1 ) .",
    "such a large difference between the refined cu2o bond lengths is consistent with fluctuations between two elongated jahn - teller configurations aligned along either pair of cu2o11/o13 bonds , _",
    "i.e. _ a dynamic jt effect .",
    "turning attention to the rhombically distorted octahedra of the cu1 site , it is noteworthy that the cu1o12 bonds also vary greatly ( 0.32(7) , @xmath51% ) despite the small difference found in the cu1o11 and cu1o13 bonds mentioned previously . for a dynamic jahn - teller effect one",
    "expects bond elongation along two or more axes of the octahedron , therefore this appears an unlikely cause .",
    "instead , we propose that it arises from the fluctuations on the cu1 site , which due to the close connectivity of the two cu sites cause rotation of the cu1o@xmath42 octahedra and , subsequently , the large observed difference in cu1o12 bond lengths .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the cu1o@xmath42 octahedra is most likely in a static jt state at @xmath16k .      , as a function of temperature for samples 1 , 2 - 0 and 2 - 72 using a measuring field of @xmath52oe in zero field cooled ( zfc ) ; sample 1 under field cooled ( fc ) and high field cooled ( hfc ) conditions is also shown . *",

    "data were all collected on warming from @xmath57 to 300k in an applied field of 100oe after initially cooling in zero - field ( zfc ) ; for sample 1 data were also taken after cooling in the measuring field ( fc ) and an applied field of 70000oe ( hfc ) . for the moment",
    ", we will concentrate on the data collected on sample 1 . at higher temperatures than those shown",
    "( figure s2 ) @xmath56 approximates to the curie - weiss law , with a weiss temperature of @xmath58k in good agreement with other vesignieite samples @xcite . a clear transition occurs at @xmath59k that is remarkably similar to that previously observed in both @xmath60vesignieite and vesignieite samples hydrothermally annealed at very high temperatures @xcite . whilst the transition resembles a ferromagnetic ordering , re - plotting @xmath56 _ vs. _ @xmath61 as @xmath53 _ vs. _ @xmath61 ( figure 4b ) shows both a sharp increase at @xmath59k followed by a comparably sharp decrease below @xmath62k suggestive of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic components to the ordering .",
    "the presence of a ferromagnetic component is confirmed by hysteresis in magnetisation measurements as a function of field at @xmath57k with a small spontaneous moment of 0.02@xmath63 ( figure s3 , s4 ) .    while no clear transition is seen in the temperature - dependence of @xmath56 or @xmath53 for samples 2 - 0 or 2 - 72 at any temperature ( figure 4a and b )",
    ", the derivative of @xmath53 ( figure 4b inset ) suggests that there is a weak transition in the 2 - 72 sample at a similar temperature to that of sample 1 .",
    "we speculate that the increase in the strength of this transition follows from the reduction in crystallographic disorder that was found in the refinements of the synchrotron data , and that these samples feature similar underlying magnetic responses , allbeit with a magnitude that depends on the level of disorder present .    in our study of `",
    "sr - vesignieite ' , the temperature dependence of the fitted weiss temperature , @xmath64 , reveals a subtle change of the magnetic response at @xmath65k that indicates the onset of static jahn - teller order on some of the cu@xmath7 sites@xcite .",
    "a similar analysis is presented in figure 4c for samples 1 and 2 - 72 for the calculated curie constant , whereby @xmath54 is determined from curie - weiss fits to @xmath66 in 50k regions and plotted as a function of temperature .",
    "both samples 1 and 2 - 72 exhibit a similar response , with @xmath54 increasing gradually between @xmath67k .",
    "interestingly , the fitted @xmath54 values are significantly less than that of the isoelectronic ` sr - vesignieite ' . defining @xmath54 from the curie law as    @xmath68",
    "one would naively expect it to be of similar value in the two materials and the discrepancy must originate from a modification of @xmath69 or @xmath70 . such an effect may occur due to changes in the orbital contributions to the magnetism of cu@xmath7 and , in fact , this is often the case for cu@xmath7 containing compounds , as discussed previously . therefore , we suggest that the onset of static jt order which occurs in ` sr - vesignieite ' , and causes the increase of @xmath54 below @xmath24k , is shifted to lower temperatures in the vesignieite samples presented .",
    "unfortunately , deviations from curie - weiss behaviour below @xmath71k means that the evolution of @xmath54 to lower temperatures can not be determined .",
    "as the value of @xmath54 at @xmath71k in vesigneite is still increasing towards that of ` sr - vesignieite ' , and in the orbitally ordered regime of both materials we may expect them to be of similar value , we conclude that the onset of static jt order is not complete in the temperature window studied .",

    "hydrothermal annealing induces crystallographic ordering of the @xmath4 structure , as evidenced from the synchrotron data , crystallographic size / strain analysis and comparisons with data already in the literature .",
    "in contrast , our new synthetic method crystallises with a fully ordered structure .",
    "close inspection of the williamson - hall plots ( figure 2 ) shows that the @xmath73 reflections in the data from sample 2 - 168 lie significantly further from the straight line fit than other crystallographic directions ( figure 2c ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath40 planes , shown in figure 5a , encompass several of the split oxygen sites and in particular the o12 site , which is shared between neighbouring cu1 sites along the cu1 chains .",
    "this observation hints at a relationship between the crystallographic strain and the static @xmath74 dynamic jt transition on the cu1 site , an effect commonly observed in other jahn - teller active materials @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism behind the reduction in strain by post - synthetic hydrothermal annealing remains unclear , we suggest that it is likely to be related to the complex jt effects of these materials .",
    "the varied behaviour of the magnetic susceptibility seen in the vesignieite samples is further evidence of magnetostructural effects .",
    "the improved samples , available by hydrothermal annealing or the new synthetic route presented here , show a considerably strengthened magnetic transition at @xmath59k that closely resembles that expected for a long - range ordered antiferromagnet @xcite . in poorer quality samples",
    "the transition at @xmath75 has been shown to be inhomogeneous with both fluctuating and static spins @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to say without further study how orbital frustration affects the magnetic response of vesignieite and whether it underlies discrepancies seen between samples and synthetic methods . in the case of the spin- and orbitally - frustrated lasrvo@xmath11 ,",
    "orbital fluctuations ` melt ' the magnetic order , suppressing the magnetic transition well below that predicted @xcite .",
    "in contrast , another common observation is that orbital ordering occurs concurrently at magnetic transitions @xcite , such as in livo@xmath2 where the superexchange becomes strongly non - uniform at the magnetic transition and changes the heisenberg approximation @xcite .",
    "returning to vesignieite , we note that a dynamic jt effect may also explain the high-@xmath61 dependence of the esr linewidth and high @xmath70-factors , which can not be explained by a spin - only model@xcite .",
    "instead , the behaviour closely resembles that recently found in ba@xmath1cusb@xmath2o@xmath15 which possesses a dynamic jt effect and short - range spin - orbital correlations @xcite .",
    "therefore , further experiments are essential to better characterise the coupling between the orbital and spin degrees - of - freedom in vesignieite , such as whether spin and orbital order occur concomitantly or if a portion of the spins remain dynamic below @xmath75 in these new samples .    as a model @xmath0 kagome magnet , it is important to now discuss the revised superexchange pathways within the revised trigonal crystal structure of vesignieite .",
    "as the cuo@xmath42 octahedra are axially elongated , whether static or dynamic , the lone electron resides in the d@xmath76 orbital , rather than the d@xmath77 as previously proposed @xcite .",
    "thus , as in ` sr - vesignieite ' , when the cu1 sites undergo a transition to static jt order the chains will be antiferro - orbitally ordered , with the orbitally disordered cu2 sites completing the kagome .",
    "a schematic of this orbital ordering pattern is shown in figure 5 , alongside the other @xmath0 kagome magnet models volborthite and herbertsmithite .",
    "vesignieite shares a similar orbital ordering to volborthite : both have the @xmath72 orbitals arranged around the kagome triangles such that there is no 3-fold rotational symmetry relating them and the orbital superexchange paths are inequivalent . where the @xmath78 orbitals mediate superexchange for all the cu@xmath7 ions , these paths would be equivalent .",
    "contrastingly , herbertsmithite has fully ordered @xmath72 orbitals that are related by 3-fold rotational symmetry at the centre of each kagome triangle , such that all superexchange paths are equivalent .",
    "no magnetic transition is observed in this latter material down to @xmath79mk @xcite . as such , the symmetry of the orbitals , and therefore that of the symmetric and antisymmetric superexchange contributions , provides the most convincing reason behind the contrasting magnetic behaviour in these @xmath0 kagome magnets .",
    "we have prepared and characterised samples of the @xmath0 kagome magnet vesignieite and determined its true crystallographic structure . the refined structure is consistent with orbital frustration due to a dynamic jt effect on a sublattice of the cu@xmath7 kagome network that persists below the magnetic transition at @xmath8k .",
    "whilst the magnetic behaviour below @xmath75 is highly sample dependent , the intimate connection between microstructural defects due to the dynamic jt effect and the observed magnetism appears to underlie these previously unexplained discrepancies .",
    "our analysis also revises the previously proposed orbital ordering pattern so that the superexchange paths connecting the cu@xmath7 are qualitatively distinct , whereas previously they were though to be essentially equivalent .",
    "the proposed orbital structure is remarkably similar to volborthite , rather than herbertsmithite , and provides the most convincing argument as to the different magnetic properties observed in these three model @xmath0 kagome magnets .",
