    "in general , it is a difficult task to establish whether or not a hamiltonian system of @xmath2 degrees of freedom is integrable .",
    "we note that there are many definitions of integrability @xcite . here",
    ", we take as definition  @xcite the existence of @xmath2 _ independent _ first integrals @xmath3 which are _ in involution _ , i.e. their mutual poisson brackets vanish @xmath4 , for all @xmath5 . in case that @xmath2 such integrals have not been found , one may try to establish the integrability of the dynamical system via the singularity analysis called the painlev test . according to the `` painlev conjecture '' a hamiltonian dynamical system is integrable if it has the painlev property .",
    "however , since carrying out the painlev test is often too difficult a task , in practice the test is performed in a reduced form called the ars - algorithm @xcite . in this paper we shall comment on an example where the ( ars ) conjecture fails .    in contopoulos et al .",
    "@xcite , and in cotsakis et al .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the einstein equations for the mixmaster space - time metric pass the ars - test ( the reduced painlev property ) and , by the above proposition , that it is probably integrable .    here",
    "we shall argue that this is very likely _ not the case_. our argument pursues the following line : first , there is a generating hamiltonian , the value of which , @xmath0 , characterizes different qualitative behaviours of the model .",
    "the case @xmath6 corresponds to the proper mixmaster universe .",
    "although it contains the chaotic gauss - map in its time - evolution there is no direct contradiction in calling the system integrable , e.g. in the sense of being solvable by an inverse scattering transform ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the evolution is in some sense ` trivial ' , but for @xmath8 might appear quite artificial .",
    "it has , however , a physical interpretation as a mixmaster universe in which matter with negative energy density is uniformly distributed .",
    "it gives the possibility of an oscillatory evolution of the three - volume of the universe @xcite and thus the possibility of periodic ( cyclic ) mixmaster universes .",
    "] we shall show that the system displays chaotic behaviour in the sense that it contains an abundance of unstable periodic orbits , even apparently infinite families of these , which in turn renders the existence of a full set of first integrals very unlikely .",
    "in fact , the proliferation of unstable periodic orbits indicates the existence of a ` smale horseshoe ' prohibiting integrability .",
    "a rigorous proof would require finding a transversal homoclinic intersection @xcite , i.e. a transversal intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic closed orbit of the system , a work currently in progress .",
    "second , the painlev analysis for the mixmaster model as presented in contopoulos et al .",
    "@xcite _ does not _ distinguish the value of this first integral , i.e. by this analysis one arrives at the contradictory statement that even in the chaotic case @xmath8 the model is probably integrable .    finally , we present numerical evidence that , despite the existence of unstable periodic orbits , the average lyapunov exponent vanishes in the case @xmath8 , contradicting data based on single trajectories presented in rugh  @xcite and hobill et al .  @xcite .",
    "the mixmaster space - time metric is a famous cosmological toy - model @xcite which has been studied extensively in the past two decades in various contexts .",
    "it is an anisotropic generalization of the standard cosmological model of our universe ( in case our universe is closed ) , the compact friedman - robertson - walker model .",
    "the mixmaster metric exhibits very complicated dynamical behaviour near its curvature singularities , illustrating an interesting non - linear aspect of the einstein equations . for a recent discussion of the characterization of chaos in general relativity and the mixmaster toy - model gravitational collapse , see e.g. s.e.rugh @xcite .",
    "the governing einstein equations for the mixmaster metric are given by a set of three second order ordinary differential equations @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the so - called scale factors of the metric , and a dot denotes derivative with respect to the ( logarithmic ) time variable @xmath13 , see landau and lifshitz @xcite  118 .",
    "the equations ( [ treordinary ] ) admit a first integral @xmath14 the _ mixmaster universe _ , with its interesting oscillatory behaviour of the scale functions near its space - time singularity , arises exactly at @xmath6 .",
    "the cosmological model was first analyzed by v.a .",
    "belinski and i.m .",
    "khalatnikov @xcite and independently by c.w .",
    "misner @xcite , who showed that the asymptotic evolution could be accurately described as a simple combinatorial evolution of the axes governed by the gauss map ( see also barrow @xcite and mayer @xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of the gauss map may seem to indicate chaotic behaviour of the system but , as the transformation to the relevant coordinates is singular and maps non - closed orbits into closed orbits , it is not clear to what extent conclusions regarding the inherent chaos of the gauss map can be carried back to the analysis of the differential system governing the mixmaster universe .",
    "following the notation of contopoulos et al .",
    "@xcite , we first perform a change of variables  : @xmath15 and find that the system can also be described as governed by the hamiltonian @xmath16 for the purpose of the painlev analysis a further change of variables is made @xmath17 and we finally end up with this version of differential equations : @xmath18 in which the first integral takes the form @xmath19    the sign of the first integral characterizes three different phases of the model .",
    "this can be seen from the scale invariance of the differential equations ( [ eq : bianchiix ] ) under the transformation @xmath20    in popular terms we may say that @xmath6 characterizes a phase transition for the system , as the qualitative description of the time evolution depends strongly on the sign of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular we note here that since the time variable scales with @xmath21 , the lyapunov exponent for the system will have to vanish for @xmath22 , revealing an apparent non - chaotic behaviour at @xmath6 , i.e. for the mixmaster universe . due to this scale invariance",
    "we are free to choose an arbitrary value of @xmath0 when we look for periodic orbits of the mixmaster system for @xmath8 , and we will choose the value @xmath23 .",
    "the painlev analysis , when applied to ( [ eq : bianchiix ] ) , showed @xcite that the system passes the ( ars ) painlev test for the case @xmath6 and therefore , according to the cited conjecture , that the system is probably integrable . the analysis does not , however , depend on the value of @xmath0 . here",
    "we focus on one of the singular solutions ( cf .",
    "in contopoulos et al .",
    "@xcite ) :    inserting and identifying coefficients in the laurent series expansion show that the singular expansions @xmath24 satisfy the set of equations ( [ eq : bianchiix ] ) to zeroth order in @xmath25 , provided @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] . here , @xmath28 is the complex time variable and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the six free parameters in the generic painlev expansion .",
    "computing @xmath0 to zeroth order ( all other terms must vanish due to the time invariance of @xmath0 ) we get : @xmath31 which is a constant of motion but in general _ does not _ vanish .",
    "thus we see , as is also the case for the other classes of singular solutions in @xcite , that the set of equations has the ( ars ) painlev property independent of the value of the first integral @xmath0 .",
    "one way to characterize non - integrability is by means of non - zero lyapunov exponents . in general , each first integral of a hamiltonian system implies the vanishing of two lyapunov exponents due to preservation of symplectic two - forms @xcite . in practice",
    "this characterization is not very useful .",
    "first , it is not easy to establish numerically due to the infinite time limit involved , and second , because the reverse need not be true , i.e. the vanishing of 2@xmath32 lyapunov exponents does not imply the existence of @xmath32 first integrals .",
    "however , in general the vanishing of lyapunov exponents occurs for almost all trajectories of infinite length .",
    "in particular , we shall consider _ closed orbits _",
    ", i.e. trajectories which return to a given point , @xmath33 , in the phase space after some period @xmath34 .",
    "periodic orbits have the great advantage ( see also @xcite ) that they are completely determined by their finite time behaviour and therefore provide a numerically easy and reliable way of stating non - integrability of the system .",
    "we write the differential equations ( [ eq : hamil])-([eq : bianchiix ] ) in the form : @xmath35 ( here @xmath36 ) and we denote by @xmath37 the flow obtained by integrating this equation . a real - analytic function @xmath0 on @xmath38",
    "is said to be a first integral if it commutes with @xmath39 , i.e. if their poisson bracket vanishes  : @xmath40 @xmath41 being the usual inner product in @xmath38 .",
    "in particular @xcite , this condition implies that the flow @xmath42 , generated by @xmath43 , commutes with @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we have the two relations  : @xmath45 assume now that we have found a periodic orbit @xmath46 of our hamiltonian flow with return time @xmath47 .",
    "we may use this periodicity condition in our two relations above , taking derivatives in @xmath33 and in @xmath48 ( at @xmath49 ) , respectively , to obtain ( tr meaning transpose )  : @xmath50 we can replace @xmath0 with @xmath39 or any other first integral ( provided they all commute ) and conclude that the ( transposed ) set of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , etc .",
    "generates a set of left invariant eigenvectors of @xmath53 while by multiplying by @xmath54 we obtain a set of right invariant eigenvectors of the same matrix .",
    "the two sets are evidently mutually orthogonal ( as the first integrals commute ) .",
    "thus we may orthonormalize each set and take their union to be a basis of @xmath38 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that in this basis @xmath53 takes the form of an upper ( or lower ) triangular matrix with @xmath55 in the diagonal .",
    "thus , we conclude that if the system has @xmath56 independent first integrals at a periodic orbit then the stability matrix has only one eigenvalue , 1 , with degeneracy @xmath57 .",
    "as poincar already noted @xcite , the presence of non - unit eigenvalues does not exclude integrability but could germinate from a degeneracy of first integrals .",
    "the simplest example of this is the stiff pendulum which , when placed at rest in its top position , is in an unstable fixed point .",
    "the separatrices @xcite through this point separate the phase space into oscillatory modes and two types of rotational modes .",
    "the eigenvalues of the stability matrix for the fixed point for any non - zero time are not on the unit - circle .",
    "the arguments above do not apply to this case as we here have @xmath58 ( a special case of degenerating first integrals ) .",
    "more complicated situations arise in integrable systems in higher dimensions when , for closed orbits , the gradients of the first integrals become linearly dependent .    as mentioned above",
    ", a rigorous proof would require the presence of a transversal homoclinic intersection @xcite .",
    "however , we insist that an abundance of unstable periodic orbits strongly indicates non - integrability of the dynamical system , i.e. that it can not possess @xmath56 commuting analytic first integrals which are independent almost everywhere .",
    "finding periodic orbits in a low - dimensional dynamical system such as ( [ treordinary ] ) means solving the equation @xmath59 and is a straightforward , if tedious , task .",
    "one starts with random initial conditions and lets the system evolve until a suitable close - return occurs .",
    "what _ is _ a suitable close - return is as much determined by elapsed time as distance between initial and final values of the variables , due to the high instability of the dynamics .",
    "one then uses the initial conditions of the close return trajectory as a starting guess in an extended newton search for a solution to ( [ obvious ] ) .",
    "this takes the following steps : + 1 .",
    "choose a poincar section , i.e. a @xmath60-dimensional surface that the trajectory will cross .",
    "this is rather arbitrary , but a plane through the initial point perpendicular to the initial velocity works well .",
    "integrate the equations of motion including the jacobian matrix @xmath61 ( here @xmath62 ) @xmath63 until the trajectory crosses the poincar section at @xmath64 , close to the initial point , @xmath65 .",
    "assume that the trajectory is close to a periodic orbit and solve the linearized version of ( [ obvious ] ) : @xmath66 i.e. solve @xmath67 this presents the problem that since @xmath61 has 1 as ( at least ) a double eigenvalue , @xmath68 is not invertible . to remedy this , we augment the equation ( [ linobv ] ) with 2 more equations and 2 more variables @xcite .",
    "the two extra equations serve the purpose of keeping the solution @xmath33 on the poincar section and preserving the first integral @xmath0 during the newton iteration , while the two variables add corrections to @xmath33 along the right / left eigenvectors of the eigenvalue 1 , i.e. @xmath69 and @xmath52 , in order to insure the existence of a solution to ( [ linobv ] ) .",
    "+ 4 . repeat until satisfactory convergence is obtained .",
    "we plot two examples of periodic orbits in figures [ simple ] and [ complex ] . in tables",
    "[ cycles ] and [ tabel2 ] we give the initial conditions , periods and eigenvalues of a few of the periodic orbits found through this method .",
    "as can be seen , the eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 2 in all our examples .",
    "we have found approximately 200 unstable periodic orbits , of which around 50 were found in a random search through phase space , whereas the remaining number was found in a systematic search for members of infinite families of orbits as described below .",
    "this numerical result makes it highly unlikely that the system is integrable for @xmath8 .",
    "the existence of unstable periodic orbits does not directly lead to chaos in the sense of a positive lyapunov exponent in the mixmaster system for @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , we have been able to find series of periodic orbits that indicate that the lyapunov exponent will converge to zero for infinite time .",
    "consider a family of periodic orbits where one of the scale factors , @xmath10 , makes one oscillation while the other two , @xmath11 and @xmath12 make @xmath32 oscillations .",
    "in figure [ 10cyc ] such an orbit with @xmath70 is shown .",
    "we find that for such a family the largest eigenvalue of @xmath61 , @xmath71 grows linearly with @xmath32 , whereas the period , @xmath72 grows as @xmath73 .",
    "this means that for the instability exponent @xmath74 , i.e. the local lyapunov exponent of the individual periodic orbits , we have : @xmath75 which will tend to zero for @xmath32 going to infinity .",
    "this is shown in table [ ncyctab ] and figure [ ncycfig ] .",
    "the limit of such a family of periodic orbits is therefore marginally stable . in the computation of the lyapunov exponent ,",
    "marginally stable regions seem to dominate making the exponent converge to zero .",
    "this conclusion is supported by a direct computation of the finite time approximation of the lyapunov exponent . starting with 1000 random initial conditions ,",
    "we have computed the average finite time lyapunov exponent , which appears to fall off as a power law with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "this result is shown in figure [ lyapexp ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the mixmaster system ( [ treordinary ] ) for @xmath8 is neither integrable nor chaotic in the sense of having a positive maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "we have noted that , according to the recent analysis by contopoulos et al .",
    "@xcite , the mixmaster cosmological model passes the painlev test not only for the case @xmath6 , i.e. the vacuum einstein equations for which the behaviour of the axes is described by the bkl - combinatorial model , but for arbitrary values of the first integral @xmath0 . at the same time",
    "we have shown that when @xmath8 , the model is probably non - integrable through the existence of an abundance of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "thus , the model provides a first example of a hamiltonian system of non - linear differential equations that passes the ars - test for the painlev property but which is not integrable .",
    "one may still speculate whether the mixmaster model has the full painlev property ( the answer appears to be negative according to the recent results of contopoulos et al . @xcite and those of latifi et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or whether the constraint @xmath6 may be incorporated in a dynamical context or in the painlev analysis in some way , avoiding the non - integrable periodic solutions described in this article and rendering the system integrable .",
