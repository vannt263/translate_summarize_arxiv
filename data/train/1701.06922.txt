    "in summary , we have illustrated the existence of different dynamical states in globally and nonlocally coupled systems of two distinct groups of identical populations of oscillators .",
    "we have analyzed the impact of frequency mismatch between the two populations .",
    "an interesting feature here is that only for certain ranges of frequency mismatch , one can observe the onset of chimera - like states in globally coupled network and the oscillators are coupled with equal strength coupling interaction .",
    "these states are different from the chimera states observed in coupled identical populations where the total number of oscillators are split into coexisting domains of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations .",
    "we have found the results are robust for certain range of unequal size populations ( both the populations contain unequal number of oscillators ) . in addition , we have found the existence of multistable regions depending on the initial state of the oscillators .",
    "further we have extended our study to analyze the dynamics of nonlocally coupled oscillators where we find the existence of chimera state for spatially prepared initial conditions .",
    "in contrast to the global coupling , existence of chimera states is independent of the increase of frequency mismatch between the two populations .",
    "in contrast to the case of global coupling , multistability does not exist in nonlocally coupled system except in the cluster state region .",
    "finally , it may be an interesting open problem to extend this study to a network of more than two populations , which we are pursuing currently .",

    "ml acknowledges the financial support under a nasi platinum jubilee senior scientist fellowship program .",
    "to identify the nature of different dynamical states , we look at the strength of incoherence of the system a notion introduced recently by gopal , venkatesan and two of the present authors@xcite , that will help us to detect interesting collective dynamical states such as synchronized state , desynchronized state , and the chimera state . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a transformation @xmath157 @xcite , where @xmath158 .",
    "we divide the oscillators into @xmath159 bins of equal length @xmath160 and the local standard deviation @xmath161 is defined as @xmath162    from this we can find the local standard deviation for every @xmath159 bins of oscillators that helps to find the strength of incoherence @xcite through @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the threshold value which is small . here",

    "when @xmath161 is less than @xmath164 , @xmath166 takes the value @xmath167 , otherwise it is @xmath168 .",

    "it has the maximum value , that is @xmath169 , for the completely incoherent desynchronized state and has intermediate values between 0 and 1 for chimera states and cluster states .                                          c. r. laing , phys .",
