    "the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon are an invaluable source of information on its structure  @xcite .",
    "for example , observing their fall as @xmath0 increases from zero revealed the finite extent of the nucleon , and measuring the sachs electric form factor of the neutron , @xmath2  @xcite , that it has a positive core surrounded by a long - range , negative tail  @xcite . in the last few years",
    "particular interest has focused on the ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton , @xmath3 , where recoil polarization data  @xcite have revealed a dramatic decrease with @xmath0  in contrast with earlier work based on the rosenbluth separation .",
    "these data have allowed one of us to deduce a fascinating spin dependence of the shape of the nucleon  @xcite .    while the behavior of @xmath3 with @xmath0 was anticipated in some models ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , there is no consensus as to which explanation best represents how qcd works . direct guidance from qcd",
    "itself would be most valuable and for that purpose lattice qcd represents the one and only technique by which one can obtain non - perturbative solutions to qcd .",
    "the qcdsf collaboration recently presented lattice qcd simulations for the form factors of the nucleon over a wide range of values of momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "while these were based on the quenched approximation , with an unsophisticated action , several lattice spacings were chosen with the smallest being around @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and at present these are the state of the art .",
    "the quark masses used in the simulations correspond to pion masses in the range @xmath6 .",
    "therefore one needs to parametrize the form factors as a function of pion mass and extrapolate to the physical value before comparing these lattice results with the experimental data .    at @xmath7",
    "there have been a number of studies of the chiral extrapolation of baryon magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "however , there is no model independent way to respect the constraints of chiral symmetry over the range of @xmath0 and @xmath8 required by the qcdsf data . instead , at finite @xmath0 , one has been led to study various phenomenological parameterizations  @xcite , which have at least ensured the correct leading order non - analytic structure as @xmath9 .",
    "our purpose here is three - fold .",
    "first , we wish to use the lattice data to investigate whether a particular quark model is capable of describing the properties of the nucleon in this additional dimension of varying @xmath8 - an important test which any respectable quark model should satisfy has proven extremely valuable , so the study of hadron properties as a function of quark mass , using the results of lattice qcd calculations , undoubtedly offers significant  insight into qcd , as well as new ways to model it @xcite . ] .",
    "second , having confirmed that the model is consistent with the lattice data over the range of @xmath8 noted earlier , we use the model to extrapolate to large values of @xmath0 ( for lattice values of @xmath8 ) .",
    "third , we also use the model to extrapolate to the physical pion mass .",
    "the model which we consider here is the light front cloudy bag model ( lfcbm )  @xcite , which was developed as a means of preserving the successes of the original cloudy bag model @xcite , while ensuring covariance in order to deal unambiguously with modern high energy experiments .",
    "the light front constituent quark model , upon which it is built @xcite , predicted the rapid decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath0 and , as the pion cloud is expected to be relatively unimportant at large @xmath0 , this success carries over to the lfcbm @xcite .",
    "furthermore the lfcbm corresponds to a lagrangian built upon chiral symmetry , so it can be extended to the limit of low quark mass as well as low and high @xmath0 .",
    "the outline of the paper follows . in sect .",
    "2 we briefly review the lfcbm . in sect .",
    "3 we present the lattice qcd data , explain the fitting procedure and present the results .",
    "4 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "the light front cloudy bag model ( lfcbm ) respects chiral symmetry and lorentz invariance and reproduces the four nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to try to use it to extrapolate the form factors computed using lattice qcd to the physical pion mass .",
    "we begin by briefly introducing the key features of the lfcbm .",
    "the lfcbm is a _ relativistic _",
    "constituent quark model incorporating the effect of _ pion - loops _ ,",
    "key features motivated by chiral symmetry .",
    "the light - front dynamics is employed to maintain the poincar invariance , and one pion - loop corrections are added to incorporate significant pion cloud effects ( particularly in the neutron electric form factor and magnetic moments ) as well as the leading non - analytic behavior imposed by chiral symmetry . in light - front dynamics the fields are quantized at a fixed time@xmath10 the light front time or @xmath11-development operator is then @xmath12 .",

    "the other coordinates are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the relation between the energy and momentum of a free particle is given by @xmath17 , with the quadratic form allowing the separation of center of mass and relative coordinates .",
    "the resulting wave functions are frame independent .",
    "the light front technique is particularly relevant for calculating form factors because one uses boosts that are independent of interactions .",

    "the form factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , equal to the charge and the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath24 in units of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the magnetic moment is @xmath27 .",
    "the evaluation of the form factors is simplified by using the so - called drell - yan reference frame in which @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 . if light - front spinors for the nucleons are used , the form factors can be expressed in terms of matrix elements of the plus component of the current @xcite:@xmath30 the form factors are calculated using the good  component of the current , @xmath31 , to suppress the effects of quark - pair terms .",

    "we stress that these two integrals differ only by the last factor , which gives the spin non - flip and spin - flip dependence of @xmath139 and @xmath144 , respectively . at high",
    "@xmath0 these matrix elements are each of order @xmath145 , causing the ratio @xmath146 to be approximately constant .",
    "so we can express @xmath147 as@xmath148 where @xmath149 denotes the integral for @xmath150 , and @xmath151 denotes the integral for @xmath152 .    in the high-@xmath0 region the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ formula_q2_cross_via_intgl ] ) is approximately a constant , because the difference comes only from the overlap factors of the spin - dependent parts of the wave functions in the integrals ( see @xcite,@xcite ) .",

    "the factor @xmath56 determines the size of the momenta appearing in the integrands of eqs.([formula_f10_prot ] ) and ( [ formula_f20_prot ] ) .",
    "the corresponding integrands differ by terms that are ratios of second order polynomials of the integration variables . for large absolute values of @xmath56",
    ", the high momenta are cut off more strongly , so that the contribution of terms that cause differences between the integrals are not very significant . for small absolute values of @xmath56",
    "the integrals become more sensitive to those terms and we obtain a larger variation of the ratios of the integrals and hence the ratio @xmath3 .",
    "we have seen that the lfcbm can produce a very good description of the lattice qcd data for the nucleon form factors over a wide range of quark masses with a smooth , analytic variation of the wave function parameter , @xmath56 , and the constituent quark mass , @xmath60 .",
    "the pion cloud plays very little role in the mass range for which the lattice simulations have been made but it rapidly becomes more important as we approach the chiral limit . from the rather strong dependence of the form factors on the lattice spacing , @xmath99 , it is not yet clear that we have obtained a good approximation to the continuum limit , but the form factors obtained at the smallest value of @xmath99 are in reasonable agreement with experimental data in the low-@xmath0 region for which the lattice simulations were made .    at present",
    "the lattice simulations are limited to values of the momentum transfer at or below @xmath154 and it is therefore a very big extrapolation to look at the behavior of the form factors in the region of greatest current interest . nevertheless , the behavior of @xmath3 which we find is particularly interesting .",
    "the ratio crosses zero for all values of the quark mass but the position where this happens varies over a very wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "this variation can be understood almost entirely in terms of the variation of the corresponding nucleon mass , given that the ratio @xmath155 is approximately @xmath0 independent in the model .",
    "we obtain the same value of @xmath0 for the cross - over whether we extrapolate the position as a function of quark mass or simply evaluate the form factors at the physical pion mass , using the fitted dependence of the wave function parameters on pion mass .    in the immediate future it is clearly very important to improve on the lattice data , both by ensuring that we really have a good approximation to the continuum limit ( e.g. , by using a suitably improved action ) and by extending the calculations to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "it would also be important to remove the need for quenching , even though that may not be such a limitation at large @xmath0 . from the point of view of developing a deeper understanding of qcd itself",
    "it is important that the lfcbm is able to describe the present lattice data over such a wide range of masses .",
    "we would encourage a similar exercise for other models as a novel test of their validity .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the lfcbm has indeed been successful in predicting the behavior of the form factors at higher @xmath0 and indeed whether it will match future experimental data .",
