    "the fundamental principle behind the creation of dissipative solitons is that their stability relies upon the simultaneous balance of conservative and dissipative ingredients in the underlying system @xcite .",
    "these are the diffraction and self - focusing nonlinearity in the conservative part of the system , and linear and nonlinear loss and gain terms in the dissipative part .",
    "well - known physical realizations of such systems are offered by lasing @xcite and plasmonic @xcite cavities , the respective models being based on the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations with the cubic - quintic ( cq ) set of gain and loss terms , combined with the background linear loss  @xcite .",
    "this combination is well known to maintain stable localized modes @xcite .",
    "the cgl  equations constitute a generic class of dissipative pattern - formation models @xcite , which find many other applications , including bosonic condensates of quasi - particles in solid - state media @xcite , reaction - diffusion systems @xcite , and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "originally , the cgl equation of the cq type was introduced @xcite as a model for the creation of stable two - dimensional ( 2d ) localized modes . following this work ,",
    "similar models were derived or proposed as phenomenological ones in various settings .",
    "many 1d and 2d localized states , i.e. , dissipative solitons , have been found as solutions of such equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient of advanced laser cavities is a transverse periodic grating , which can be fabricated by means of available technologies jena .",
    "in addition to the permanent gratings , virtual photonic lattices may be induced in photorefractive crystals as interference patterns by pairs of pump beams with the ordinary polarization , which illuminate the crystal along axes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while the probe beam with the extraordinary polarization is launched along @xmath2 @xcite . a 2d cavity model with the grating",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "it is based on the cq - cgl equation including the cellular ( lattice ) potential , which represents the grating .",
    "in fact , the laser cavity equipped with the grating may be considered as a photonic crystal built in the active medium .",
    "periodic potentials also occur in models of passive optical systems , which are driven by external beams and operate in the temporal domain , unlike the active systems which act in the spatial domain @xcite .",
    "localized vortices , alias vortex solitons , are an important species of self - trapped modes in 2d settings . in uniform media ,",
    "dissipative vortex solitons can not be stable without the presence of a diffusion term , in the framework of the cgl equation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , this term is absent in models of waveguiding systems ( it may sometimes be present in temporal - domain optical models @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , compound vortices , built as complexes of four peaks pinned to the lattice potential , may be stable in models including the grating in the absence of the diffusion @xcite . using this possibility ,",
    "stable 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite vortical solitons have been found in the framework of cgl equations including trapping potentials .    in a majority of previous works ,",
    "the studies of various 2d localized patterns have been focused on their stabilization by means of the lattice potentials .",
    "another relevant issue is mobility of 2d dissipative solitons in the presence of the underlying lattice ( dissipative solitons may move without friction only if the diffusion term is absent , therefore the mobility is a relevant issue for the diffusion - free models of laser cavities ) .",
    "localized modes can be set in motion by the application of a kick to them , which , in the context of the laser - cavity models , implies launching a tilted beam into the system .",
    "recently , the mobility of kicked 2d fundamental solitons in the cq - cgl equation with the cellular potential was studied in ref .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the kicked soliton , hopping through the periodic structure , leaves in its wake various patterns in the form of single- or multi - peak states trapped by the periodic potential . in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) , which correspond to an annular system , the free soliton completes the round trip and hits the pattern that it has originally created .",
    "depending on parameters , the free soliton may be absorbed by the pinned mode ( immediately , or after several  up to five  cycles of quasi - elastic collisions ) , or the result may be a regime of periodic elastic collisions , which features periodic cycles of passage of the moving soliton through the quiescent one .    a natural extension of the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the study of the mobility of kicked soliton complexes , such as dipoles , quadrupoles , and compound vortices , and various scenarios of the dynamical pattern formation initiated by such moving complex modes , in the framework of the 2d cq - cgl equation with the lattice potential .",
    "this is the subject of the present work .",
    "in fact , such configurations are truly two - dimensional ones , while the dynamical regimes for kicked fundamental solitons , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , actually represent quasi-1d settings .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii , which is followed by the presentation of systematic numerical results for dipoles , quadrupoles , and vortices of two types , onsite and offsite - centered ones ( alias  rhombuses \" and  squares \" ) in sections iii , iv , and v , respectively .",
    "the paper is concluded by section vi .",
    "an essential finding is that the interaction of a freely moving dipole with pinned patterns , originally created by the same kicked dipole , gives rise to new outcomes under the periodic b.c . in particular ,",
    "the quiescent dipole can be absorbed ( cleared \" ) by the moving one , which may have obvious applications to the design of all - optical data - processing schemes , where one may need to install or remove a blocking soliton .",
    "also noteworthy is the transformation of an unstable vortex by a strong kick into a stable moving four - soliton cluster .",
    "the cq - cgl equation with a periodic potential is written as    @xmath3 u. \\label{cgl}\\ ] ]    it describes the evolution of the amplitude of electromagnetic field @xmath4 along propagation direction @xmath5 , with transverse laplacian @xmath6 .",
    "parameter @xmath7 is the linear - loss coefficient , @xmath8 is the cubic gain , @xmath9 the quintic loss , and @xmath10 the quintic self - defocusing coefficient ( it accounts for the saturation of the kerr effect if @xmath11 ) .",
    "the 2d periodic potential with amplitude @xmath12 is taken in the usual form , @xmath13 $ ] , where the normalization of the field and coordinates is chosen so as to make the normalized period equal to @xmath14 , which is always possible .",
    "the total power of the field is also defined as usual,@xmath15    we solved cgl equation ( [ cgl ] ) by means of the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm in the @xmath5-direction , and five - point finite - difference scheme for the computation of the transverse laplacian @xmath16 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) were used for the study of kicked dipoles and quadrupoles , and absorbing b.c . for kicked vortices . in the latter case , the absorbing b.c .",
    "was implemented by adding a surrounding linear - absorption strip to the computation box .",
    "the absorption coefficient varies quadratically with @xmath17 and @xmath18 from zero at the internal border of the strip to a value large enough to induce complete absorption of any outgoing pulse , at its external border .",
    "this smooth variation , if the width of the strip is not too small , allows one to suppress any reflection from the absorption strip .",
    "values of coefficients chosen for numerical simulations are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "this choice corresponds to a set of parameters for which the initial static configurations for the dipoles , quadrupoles , and vortices are stable ( in - phase bound states of two dissipative solitons are possible too , but , unlike the dipoles , with the phase shift of @xmath24 between the bound solitons , they are unstable ) .",
    "the kick is applied to then in the usual way , by adding the linear phase profile to the initial field:@xmath25where @xmath26 .",
    "the key parameters are length @xmath27 of kick vector @xmath28 , and angle @xmath29 which it makes with the @xmath17-axis , i.e. , @xmath30    in the laser setup the kick corresponds to a small deviation of the propagation direction of the beam from the @xmath5 axis . if @xmath31 is the full wave number and @xmath32 is the deviation angle , the length of the transverse wave vector in physical units is @xmath33 , which corresponds to @xmath27 in the normalized form .",

    "it is instructive too to perform the simulations for the vortex with the opposite vorticity ( @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 ) . in this way",
    ", the expected symmetry reversal has been verified ( not shown here in detail ) : the same results as above are obtained , with angle @xmath29 replaced by its counterpart , which is symmetric with respect to the closest coordinate axis .",
    "we note too that identical results were obtained using both periodic and absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "the objective of this work is to extend the analysis of the dynamical pattern - formation scenarios in the cq - cgl ( cubic - quintic complex ginzburg - landau ) equation with the 2d cellular potential .",
    "the equation is the model for laser cavities with built - in gratings , represented by the spatially periodic potential .",
    "recently , the quasi-1d pattern - formation scenarios , initiated by the moving fundamental solitons , were studied in this model . here",
    ", we have systematically analyzed the fully 2d scenarios , produced by kicking compound modes , _",
    "viz_. , dipoles , offsite - centered quadrupoles , and vortices of two different types , onsite- and offsite - centered ones . the motion of the kicked compound through the cellular potential leads to the generation of diverse multi - peak patterns pinned to the lattice , which the moving object leaves in its wake .",
    "in the annular system with periodic boundary conditions , the persistently traveling dipole hits the pinned pattern from the opposite direction . in this way ,",
    "several dynamical regimes are initiated , including the periodically recurring elastic passage of the free dipole through the quiescent one , and transient regimes , which lead , after a few quasi - elastic collisions , to absorption of one dipole by the other . in the case of vortices ,",
    "the dependence of the outcome on the magnitude and direction of the kick was investigated too .",
    "in particular , a noteworthy result is that a strong kick transforms the original offsite - centered vortex ( which is unstable by itself ) into a clean stably moving four - soliton cluster .",
    "the analysis can be extended by considering two - component systems ( which would take the polarization of light into account ) , collisions between independently created moving modes , and the motion of kicked solitons in inhomogeneous lattices .",
    "eventually , the analysis may be generalized for the three - dimensional setting , which is not relevant to optics , but may be realized , in principle , in terms of bose - einstein condensates of polariton - exciton quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the work of dm was supported in part by a senior chair grant from the rgion pays de loire , france .",
    "support from the romanian ministry of education and research ( project pn - ii - id - pce-2011 - 3 - 0083 ) is also acknowledged by this author .",
