    "we shall shortly give the formal definition of a honeycomb as introduced in @xcite , but first we shall rephrase weyl s problem in a more symmetric form .",

    "clearly we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the negation of @xmath8 .",
    "thus to solve weyl s problem it suffices to determine the set of triples @xmath28 which obey .",
    "this formulation has the advantage of @xmath33 symmetry in @xmath34 , as opposed to mere @xmath35 symmetry in @xmath36 .",
    "the trace identity in this new formulation becomes @xmath37 while becomes @xmath38 based on these relations , it is natural to introduce the plane @xmath39 we shall always depict this plane with the six `` cardinal directions '' @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 drawn northwest , north , northeast , southeast , south , and southwest respectively .",
    "( of course , `` northwest '' makes a 60 degree angle with north rather than a 45 degree angle , and similarly for the other diagonal cardinal directions . )    a _ diagram _ will be defined as a configuration of ( possibly half - infinite ) line segments in @xmath46 , with each edge parallel to one of the cardinal directions ( north - south , northeast - southwest , northwest - southeast ) , and labeled with a positive integer which we refer to as the `` multiplicity '' or `` tension '' . to every diagram we can associate a measure on @xmath46 , defined as the sum of lebesgue measure on each line segment , weighted by the multiplicity .",
    "we say that two diagrams @xmath47 , @xmath48 are _ equivalent _ if their associated measures are equal .",
    "if @xmath49 is a diagram and @xmath50 is a point in @xmath46 , we say that @xmath50 is a * * zero - tension point of @xmath49 if , in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath50 , @xmath49 is equivalent to a union of rays emanating from @xmath50 , and the sum of the co - ordinate vectors of these rays , multiplied by their tensions , equals zero .    the two possibilities that will interest us most are a point on a line segment , in which case the zero - tension condition says that the two rays must have the same multiplicity , and a point at the center of a y with again three equal - multiplicity rays .",
    "there are several more complicated possibilities , as shown in figure [ fig : ztensvs ] .",
    "define a * * honeycomb @xmath49 as a diagram ( or more precisely , an equivalence class of diagrams ) such that    1 .",
    "every point in @xmath46 is a zero - tension point 2 .",
    "there are only finitely many `` vertices , '' i.e. points with more than two rays emanating 3 .",
    "the semiinfinite lines go only in the northeast , northwest , and south directions ( i.e. no southeast , southwest , or north rays )    the lines mentioned in part 3 are called the * * boundary edges of the honeycomb .",
    "two examples of honeycombs appear in figure [ fig : honeyex ] .",
    "it is a pleasant exercise to show that the number of boundary edges ( with multiplicity ) pointing in one cardinal direction is the same as the number in each of the other two directions .",
    "( this is basically because the net tension of the honeycomb must be zero . )",
    "we will call a honeycomb with @xmath4 boundary edges in each direction an * * @xmath4-honeycomb and denote the space of such by @xmath51 .    since every edge in a honeycomb is parallel to a cardinal direction ,",
    "each of which has one of its three coordinates being zero , every honeycomb edge has a * * constant coordinate ( common to every point along that edge . )",
    "in particular we can read off the constant coordinates of boundary edges and call them @xmath52 as in figure [ fig : honeylabel ] .",
    "we can now phrase theorem [ thm : cexist ] in this symmetrized setting :    [ thm : cexist - sym ] the relationship @xmath53 holds if and only if there exists a honeycomb with boundary values @xmath54 .",
    "interestingly , almost all the proofs we know of this theorem proceed by first proving a quantized version of this theorem , which we define in the next section .",
    "we shall therefore not discuss the proof of this theorem here , and content ourselves instead with producing evidence which strongly suggests that the theorem is plausible .",
    "we first consider the @xmath55 case . in this case",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and it is clear that holds if and only if @xmath59 .",
    "( in other words , the trace condition is already necessary and sufficient . ) on the honeycomb side , this claim can be easily seen , if one accepts the fact ( which is actually a little tricky to prove ) that @xmath60-honeycombs must have the shape of a `` y '' .",
    "see figure [ fig:1dim ] .",
    "more generally , it is a pleasant exercise to show that the boundary values of any @xmath4-honeycomb must satisfy , basically because the three co - ordinates around every vertex sum to zero ( by virtue of lying in @xmath46 ) .",
    "now consider the @xmath61 case , so that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in this case",
    "there can be at most one 2-honeycomb with the specified boundary values ( figure [ fig:2dim ] ) .",
    "the lengths of the three line segments in the honeycomb can be computed as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "since these line segments need to have non - negative length , we obtain the necessary conditions @xmath68 these inequalities can be rephrased as the statement that the quantities @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 form the lengths of a triangle . the reader may verify from some linear algebra that these conditions are indeed necessary and sufficient for .    in the @xmath72 case things",
    "become more complicated , because the boundary values no longer uniquely determine the honeycomb .",
    "in fact , every hexagon which is present in a honeycomb provides a degree of freedom ; the hexagon can be `` breathed '' inwards or outwards ( see figure [ fig : hexbreathe ] ) .",
    "however , it is still possible to demonstrate that inequalities such as must hold for @xmath4-honeycombs .",
    "indeed , one can simply extend the @xmath73 ray northward until it intersects the @xmath74 ray .",
    "this intersection point must be northwest of the intersection of @xmath75 and @xmath74 , which gives .",
    "the reader may be amused by locating proofs of similar inequalities such as @xmath76 .    on the positive side ,",
    "it is easy to see that will hold if there exist permutations @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for all @xmath79 .",
    "the honeycomb analogue of this is depicted in figure [ fig : overlay-1 ] ; one can obtain a ( rather degenerate ) @xmath4-honeycomb by overlaying @xmath4 separate 1-honeycombs on top of one another .",
    "more generally , there is a notion of _ overlaying _ an @xmath4-honeycomb @xmath49 and an @xmath80-honeycomb @xmath81 to form an @xmath82-honeycomb @xmath83 . to be precise , @xmath83 is the honeycomb whose associated measure is the sum of the measures associated to @xmath49 and @xmath81 .",
    "this operation corresponds to the direct sum operation on hermitian matrices ( which takes an @xmath2 matrix and an @xmath84 matrix and forms an @xmath85 block - diagonal matrix ) , or of the concatenation operation on spectra ( which takes a set of @xmath4 eigenvalues and a set of @xmath80 eigenvalues and forms the ( sorted ) set of @xmath82 eigenvalues . ) intuitively , an overlay can be demonstrated by drawing two honeycombs on transparencies and stacking both transparencies on the same projector ; see figure [ fig : overlay ] .",
    "we shall have more to say about overlays later in this article .",
    "the relation is clearly @xmath33 symmetric , however the statement that @xmath34 admits a honeycomb with these boundary values only appears to be symmetric under cyclic permutations and the inversion @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to show that honeycombs do indeed obey the full @xmath33 symmetry ; an elegant proof of this based on scattering arguments is given in @xcite .",
    "the same argument also gives the associativity property @xmath87 this property , combined with a `` pieri rule '' to handle the generating cases when @xmath5 or @xmath7 is equal to @xmath88 for some small @xmath89 , can be used to give an inductive proof of theorem [ thm : cexist ] .",
    "an interesting degenerate case occurs when @xmath8 is kept fixed , while the spacings between eigenvalues of @xmath5 and @xmath7 are allowed to become very large . in this case",
    "the honeycomb degenerates into a pattern known as a gelfand - cetlin pyramid , while weyl s problem degenerates to schur s problem of determining which @xmath4-tuples can be the diagonal entries of a hermitian matrix with specified eigenvalues .",
    "( in fact , we discovered honeycombs by extrapolating from this degenerate case . )",
    "we encourage the reader to try out the honeycomb java applet at    http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/java/honeycombs.html",
    "the space @xmath51 of all @xmath4-honeycombs has been defined as an abstract set , but one can in fact give this space the structure of a polyhedral cone inside some finite dimensional vector space .    call a honeycomb * * nondegenerate if    1 .",
    "all its edges are multiplicity 1 , and 2 .",
    "all its vertices are either right - side - up or upside - down y s .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that all nondegenerate @xmath4-honeycombs have the same topological shape , namely that of [ fig : exnondeg ] ; in particular there is a natural way to correspond the edges in one @xmath4-honeycomb with those in any other .",
    "this gives us a way of making the space of nondegenerate @xmath4-honeycombs into an open polyhedral cone in a real vector space , with defining hyperplanes given by rational co - efficients .",
    "the coordinates are given by the constant coordinates of the edges , linear equalities must be imposed saying that the constant coordinates of three edges meeting at a vertex add to zero , and linear inequalities which say that every edge has strictly positive length .",
    "@xcite[thm : picturesdontlie ] the identification in the above paragraph , between nondegenerate @xmath4-honeycombs and points in a certain rational polyhedral open cone , extends to an identification of all @xmath51 with the closure of this cone .",
    "in particular , nondegenerate @xmath4-honeycombs form a dense open set in @xmath51 .",
    "this theorem is surprisingly annoying to prove , and takes pp .",
    "1067 - 1074 of @xcite .",
    "its virtue is in enabling us to use the theory of such cones to define the special honeycombs that we will deform to , as explained in the introduction .    for a honeycomb @xmath49 , let @xmath90 denote the list @xmath91 of constant coordinates on the boundary edges of @xmath49 , and @xmath92 be the image of this map @xmath93",
    "then we can think of the main question as being to list the inequalities determining @xmath94 .",
    "it is not hard to show directly that this map is proper , so each fiber is a compact , convex polyhedron .    as one application of this formalism",
    ", we can easily show that for any @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the truth or falsity of or can be determined in polynomial time with respect to the dimension @xmath4 ; this fact appears to be previously unknown .",
    "indeed , the problem is equivalent to determining whether the polytope @xmath95 is non - empty .",
    "since the cone @xmath51 has about @xmath96 faces , this can be achieved in polynomial time by standard algorithms ( e.g. the simplex method ) .",
    "[ the authors thank peter shor for pointing out this fact ] .",
    "one can also use this formalism to create a more quantitative version of theorems [ thm : cexist ] and [ thm : cexist - sym ] .",
    "let @xmath18 be the random variable with the uniform distribution on @xmath6 ( where `` uniform '' can be defined using induced lebesgue measure , or the @xmath0 action ) . in other words , @xmath18 is a random matrix with spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "one can then define @xmath97 to be the probability density of the spectrum of the sum @xmath20 of two independent random matrices evaluated at @xmath8 .",

    "in fact , for each integer @xmath5 we can define the irreducible representation @xmath104 as a one - dimensional vector space , with the action of @xmath105 given by multiplication by @xmath106 on @xmath107 .",
    "more generally , for any weakly decreasing sequence @xmath3 of integers we can define an irreducible unitary representation @xmath107 of @xmath0 by standard constructions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    ", one can view the classical problem as a problem of describing how the moments of inertia of bodies in @xmath120 behave under superposition , while the quantum problem is the problem of describing how the spin states of particles in @xmath120 behave under superposition .",

    ", the saturation conjecture would give a complete solution to the ( now equivalent ) problems , , given by horn s conjecture .",
    "we shall keep the reader in suspense as to the actual statement of horn s conjecture for a little while longer , and instead turn to the honeycomb - based proof of saturation .",
    "in light of the theorems of the previous section , the saturation conjecture can be reduced to the following purely honeycomb - theoretic problem :    [ honey - sat ] let @xmath49 be a ( real - valued ) honeycomb with integer boundary values .",
    "then there exists an integer honeycomb @xmath81 with the same boundary values as @xmath49 .    or in other words :",

    "for example , in the left honeycomb in figure [ fig : loops ] there is a loop , whereas the honeycomb on the right is acyclic .",
    "the importance of loops in simply degenerate honeycombs is that they can be breathed in and out , as in figure [ fig : loops ] , generalizing the case of dilating a single hexagon .",

    "a largest lift is by assumption already at the maximum value of the functional , so there can be no loops .    from this lemma one can show that the co - ordinates of regular largest lifts are integral linear combinations of the boundary values .",
    "those who wish to see the details should go to @xcite , but the argument is intuitively clear . given a honeycomb with some edges labeled by their constant coordinates and some still mysterious , look for vertices with two known constant coordinates .",

    "<S> horn s conjecture @xcite , which given the spectra of two hermitian matrices describes the possible spectra of the sum , was recently settled in the affirmative . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss one of the many steps in this , which required us to introduce a combinatorial gadget called a _ honeycomb _ ; the question is then reformulable as about the existence of honeycombs with certain boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> another important tool is the connection to the representation theory of the group @xmath0 , by `` classical vs. quantum '' analogies .            </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 is an @xmath2 hermitian matrix , then the spectrum @xmath3 can be written as a weakly decreasing sequence of @xmath4 real numbers . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for every spectrum @xmath5 we can form the set @xmath6 of hermitian matrices with spectrum @xmath5 ; this set is known as a _ co - adjoint orbit _ of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are three spectra , we define the relation @xmath9 if there exist hermitian matrices @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 such that @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the `` c '' in @xmath14 stands for `` classical '' ; we will define a quantum analogue @xmath15 later on . ) for instance , one can easily verify that @xmath16 but that @xmath17    in 1912 , hermann weyl @xcite posed the problem of determining the set of triples @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 for which held . or more informally : given the eigenvalues of two hermitian matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , what are all the possible eigenvalues of the sum @xmath20 ? </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this article is to describe the successful resolution to this problem , based on recent breakthroughs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is fairly easy to obtain necessary conditions in order for to hold . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , from the simple observation that the trace of @xmath20 must equal the sum of the traces of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we obtain the condition @xmath21 another immediate constraint is that @xmath22 since the largest eigenvalue of @xmath20 is at most the sum of @xmath18 and @xmath19 s individual largest eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> ( exercise for the reader : show equality occurs exactly when the same vector is a principal eigenvector for both matrices . ) </S>",
    "<S> weyl found a number of similar necessary conditions , such as the statement @xmath23 whenever @xmath24 , and many more necessary conditions were found by later authors . </S>",
    "<S> all of these conditions took the form of homogeneous linear inequalities ( e.g. @xmath25 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon was then explained in the work of alfred horn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on extensive computations for small @xmath4 , horn then described a recursive algorithm for generating a list of such linear inequalities , and conjectured that this list , together with the trace identity , gave a necessary and sufficient set of criteria for . </S>",
    "<S> his conjecture turned out to be correct , though it waited 36 years for resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> we approached this problem by first observing that the relation could be converted into a statement about _ honeycombs _ , which we introduced ( for this purpose ) in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are a family of planar arrangements of edges labeled with multiplicities ( some examples are in figure [ fig : honeyex ] . ) we give the precise definition in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of honeycombs to sums of hermitian matrices is the following theorem , which we explain in more detail later :    [ thm : cexist ] the relationship holds if and only if there exists a honeycomb with boundary values @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now briefly summarize the sequence of events leading to the full proof of horn s conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known for some time that the `` classical '' problem of summing hermitian matrices is closely related to the `` quantum '' problem @xmath27 of tensoring @xmath0 representations , which we shall define later . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it was well - known that implies . </S>",
    "<S> the converse implication ( for integral @xmath28 ) was known as the _ saturation conjecture_. using some formidable algebraic and geometric machinery , klyachko @xcite was able to demonstrate a further non - trivial recursive relationship between the classical and quantum problems , and noted that this , combined with the saturation conjecture , would imply horn s conjecture . in @xcite , theorem [ thm : cexist ] ( and the quantum analogue of this theorem ) were used to convert the saturation conjecture into a statement about honeycombs , and then proved this statement by combinatorial methods , thus proving the saturation and horn conjectures . </S>",
    "<S> ( recently it has been shown @xcite that one can derive horn s conjecture directly from the saturation conjecture by purely combinatorial techniques , bypassing the machinery of @xcite . also , a very different proof of saturation , based on the representation theory of quivers , has since been given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a short rendition of @xcite can be found in @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> we shall give a rather ahistorical ( and pro - honeycomb ) survey of this circle of ideas , starting with honeycombs ( which were actually the last piece of the puzzle to be discovered ) , then discussing the connections between the classical and quantum problems , followed by a sketch of the honeycomb - based proof of the saturation conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> then we state horn s conjecture , and sketch the honeycomb - based proof of this from saturation .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many other closely related and interesting mathematical questions that we will not address , and we shall refer to the reader to the excellent survey article @xcite . </S>"
