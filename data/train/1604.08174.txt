    "the structure of quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) matter at very high temperatures [ much higher than the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) , which characterizes the hadron - quark deconfinement phase - transition ] is well understood by perturbation theory , for instance . but the entire quark - hadron phase structure still represents a great challenge to lattice qcd and particle scientists . on one hand , it is difficult to draw predictions for the properties of qcd matter , especially the partonic matter , at arbitrary finite temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "the reason is that qcd under extreme conditions of temperatures and densities remains strongly coupled . on the other hand , non - perturbative approaches , such as lattice qcd simulations , the only available first - principles calculation - tools ,",
    "turn to be very reliable , especially at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "this predicts that the crossover to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) occurs at @xmath1 and might be tolerated to be implemented at finite chemical potentials but much less than the temperatures .",
    "however , this approach ca nt be used at higher chemical potentials and lower temperatures which characterize the color - superconducting phase structure , for instance .",
    "alternatively , the models that incorporate some of qcd properties are easier to be implemented in order to draw even a rough picture about the quark - hadron phase structure that might occur at almost arbitrary finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "nambu - jona - lasinio models @xcite , which exclude the gluonic degrees of freedom and replace the strong interaction by four - fermion interaction , are widely - used effective models .",
    "another approach is the ( non)linear - sigma model , which was introduced by gell - mann and levy @xcite as a lagrangian theory of maps . in this qcd - like model ,",
    "the spinless sigma meson , the scalar which was introduced earlier by schwinger , largely gives the degrees of freedom and is allowed to be mapped to a ( non)linear manifold called the target manifold .",
    "this model is a prototype of spontaneous symmetry breaking and describes the quarks interaction through the exchange of pion- and sigma - meson fields .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the utilization of mean field approximation of su(@xmath2 ) polyakov linear - sigma model ( plsm ) in order to characterize the quark - hadron phase structure by calculating the chiral order - parameter ( @xmath3 ) , and the light and strange quarks net - condensate ( @xmath4 ) at finite temperature and vanishing chemical potential .    due to oppositely flying of charges approaching relativistic energy limits especially in off - central collisions of heavy ions , a huge magnetic field can be created in heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments .",
    "because of the very short spending ( life - time ) of the evolution of such magnetic field , it is assumed to have almost no effect on the detector and its external magnet but remarkable influences on the strongly interacting qcd matter .",
    "in addition to hot and dense qcd matter , the influence of a strong magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) on the structure of qcd matter is also a very interesting subject .",
    "this kind of investigation has realistic relevance to phenomenology of relativistic heavy - ion collisions in which a strong magnetic field is produced in non - central collisions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the expected values of the magnetic field strengths in the different hic experiments such as superproton synchrotron ( sps ) , relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) ranges between @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite , where @xmath9 gauss .    concerning the phenomenologically interesting consequence from the magnetic field effect on the qcd matter , there have been many investigations . the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , at cern ,",

    "recently , various qcd - like models have been devoted to study the influences of finite magnetic field on the strongly interacting qcd matter at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "these can be compared with the studies on vanishing magnetic filed @xcite .",
    "many of these studies have investigated the quark - hadron phase - transition in thermal and dense medium , which are conjectured to improve the description of the qcd phase - diagram . following this procedure ,",
    "we perform our calculations for the quark - hadron phase - structure and qcd equation of state ( eos ) from plsm . furthermore",

    "the su(@xmath2 ) plsm is utilized to characterize the respective influences of the magnetic field on the quark - hadron phase - transition in a wide range of temperatures .",
    "prior to confronting our results to lattice qcd , we show that the order parameters have a reasonable agreement with the lattice simulations .",
    "we also confront the various thermodynamic quantities to different lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the characterization of the hadronic equation of state has been discussed in ref .",

    "the specific heat grows with increasing temperature .",
    "apart from the plsm peak that appears at the transition temperature , the specific heat approaches the corresponding sb - limit at high temperatures .",
    "the deviation sb limits might be due to the differences in the contributing gluon degrees of freedom .",

    "unfortunately , no lattice qcd calculations exist to compare our plsm results with .",
    "we notice that the deviation from sb - limit is relatively large .",
    "as introduced in section [ thermo ] , the magnetization largely affects the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting qcd matter .",
    "the magnetization refers to the response of the system of interest on the applied magnetic field , which is very likely in hic . because of the relativistic , off - center motion of the spectators in peripheral collisions ( motion of electric charge generates magnetic field perpendicular to plane of both motion direction and electric field ) and because of local imbalance in the momenta that are carried by the colliding nucleons in peripheral and even central collisions ( such local imbalance leads to angular momentum and thus magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "such magnetic field can be very huge , @xmath129 , i.e. very much larger than the detector magnet field .",
    "the magnetization ( @xmath80 ) can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnet ] ) in gev@xmath117 natural units .",
    "the sign of magnetization signals an important magnetic property of the system of interest . in our case ,",
    "the qcd matter is _",
    "para_- or _",
    "dia_-magnetic if @xmath130 or @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , from solid state physics , we borrow that    * in _",
    "dia_-magnetic qcd matter , the thermal qcd medium aligns oppositely to the direction of the magnetic field and produces an induced electric current , which spreads as small loops attempting to cancel the effects of the applied magnetic field , and * in _",
    "para_-magnetic qcd matter , the thermal qcd medium aligns towards the direction of the magnetic field .    in middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magn_tceb ] ( b ) , the magnetization @xmath80 is given as a function of temperatures at @xmath132 ( dotted ) , @xmath133 ( dashed ) , @xmath134 ( double - dotted ) and @xmath135 gev@xmath136 ( dash - dotted curve ) at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the results are compared with recent lattice qcd @xcite at @xmath114 ( closed square ) , @xmath133 ( open circle ) , @xmath134 ( open triangle ) and @xmath135 gev@xmath136 ( astride ) .",
    "it is apparent that the sign of the magnetization is positive and @xmath130 increases with the magnetic field .",
    "the positive sign of magnetization indicates that the paramagnetic contribution of qcd matter becomes dominant with increasing temperature . within the temperature range characterizing the hadron phase ( below @xmath0 ) , the plsm curve seems to resemble the lattice data in an excellent way . at temperatures characterizing qgp ( above @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the plsm curve becomes larger than the lattice data , especially at very high temperatures . in this range of temperatures ,",
    "the hadrons are conjectured to deconfine into color , quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "it seems that these degrees of freedom are not sufficient enough to achieve a good agreement at very high temperature .",
    "furthermore , plsm has a temperature - limited applicability depending on the temperature - applicability of its order parameters , section [ sec : model ] . only within this limit the capability of plsm to characterize the magnetic properties of hot qcd matter",
    "is guaranteed .    in additional to the modifications in the thermodynamic quantities due to the finite magnetic field , which are mainly determined by the magnetization ( @xmath80 )",
    ", it intends now to characterize the magnetic catalysis . as in quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) , the magnetic catalysis describes how the magnetic field dynamically generates masses .",
    "furthermore , the meissner effect describes how the magnetic field changes the order of the phase transition in type - i superconductor .",
    "these two phenomena are borrowed to study the possible influence of finite magnetic field on the qcd phase - space structure @xcite and/or the response of hadronic and partonic matter to nonzero magnetic field in thermal and dense medium @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of finite magnetic field in the qcd - effective models is achieved through modification in the phase space , energy - momentum dispersion relations and landau levels occupations .",
    "various works such as @xcite have been devoted to characterize the magnetic catalysis .",
    "accordingly , the critical temperatures increase as the magnetic field increases . on the other hand ,",
    "other works have concluded a decrease in the critical temperature as the magnetic field increases @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the increase in @xmath137 with the magnetic field is possible unless some parameters are fine - tuned and the coupling constant is assumed to vary with the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath138 .",
    "furthermore , it was remarked that @xmath139 does not enable plsm to reproduce @xmath137 as deduced from lattice qcd calculations , especially in magnetic field strengths @xmath140gev@xmath117 . in the present work ,",
    "it intends to reproduce recent lattice qcd calculations from plsm calculations . in doing this",
    ", we assume that the quark - hadron coupling constant @xmath141 and the polyakov loop deconfinement temperatures @xmath142 and @xmath50mev in vanishing finite magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the main difference between this present work and literature is the outcome from the free energy at finite volume , eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "we find that the free energy at @xmath143 is utilized in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) . while at finite values of @xmath5",
    ", @xmath144 becomes active .",
    "the delta function vanishes at all finite values of @xmath5 and vice versa .",
    "accordingly , we dis- or in - clude the last term of eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "we conclude that temperature dependence of the thermodynamic quantities at finite magnetic fields are smaller than those at zero magnetic field .",
    "this means that the results are shifted to lower , e.g. smaller @xmath0 as well , with increasing magnetic field .    in this",
    "regards , there are two different mechanisms .",
    "the first one is that the magnetic field improves the phase - transition due to its contributions to the landau quantizations or levels .",
    "the second mechanism assumes that , the magnetic field contributes to the suppression in the chiral condensates relevant to the restoration of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this suppression is known as inverse magnetic catalysis and manifests a decrease in the chiral critical temperature with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magn_tceb ] ( a ) illustrates the subtracted chiral - condensates and the deconfinement phase transition at different values of magnetic field @xmath63 ( solid curves ) , @xmath114 ( dotted curves ) , @xmath115 ( dashed curves ) , @xmath145 ( double - dotted curves ) and @xmath146gev@xmath117 ( dotted - dash curves ) . the increase in the magnetic field strength suppresses the chiral condensate relevant to the restoration of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "again , the earliness of the chiral - condensate expiration ( suppression ) relative to the temperature points to chiral magnetic catalysis , where the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) decreases with increasing the magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , we can extract the variation of the critical temperature with raising the magnetic field in right - hand panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : magn_tceb ] .    the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magn_tceb ] ( c ) shows the variation of the critical temperature with increasing magnetic field at vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the plsm critical temperature is to be estimated from the intersection point ( in temperature axis ) between the subtracted chiral condensate @xmath4 and the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "it is apparent that the critical temperature decreases with the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , the plsm calculations indicate a good agreement with recent lattice qcd simulation @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we have combined su(@xmath2 ) linear - sigma model with the polyakov - loop corrections in order to address the deconfinement phase - transition and characterize the chiral quark - meson structure .",
    "the plsm calculations indicate that the chiral condensates ( @xmath66 and @xmath147 ) and deconfinement order parameters or polyakov loops ( @xmath39 and @xmath148 ) are relatively sensitive to the magnetic field strength .",
    "the other order parameters of this model such as @xmath3 and subtracted condensate @xmath4 have a much better agreement with the recent lattice qcd simulations . in case of vanishing magnetic field ,",
    "we observe a fair matching with the lattice qcd calculations , especially for the restoration of broken chiral symmetry .",
    "this phase transition is not prompt but rather a _",
    "slow _ crossover .",
    "increasing the magnetic filed strength tends to suppress the chiral phase - transition and decrease the quasi - chiral temperatures .",
    "concretely , we found that the chiral temperatures for light - quark condensate @xmath149 decreases faster than the chiral temperatures for strange - quark condensate @xmath150 .",
    "the plsm in the presence of finite magnetic field assumes some restrictions to be added to the quarks due to the existence of free charges in the plasma phase .",
    "the yukawa coupling of quarks seems to play an essential role in achieving an excellent agreement with recent lattice qcd .",
    "furthermore , the qcd system undergoes modifications due to the presence of finite magnetization .",
    "the free energy is given as an integral over the longitudinal momentum , which is directed towards @xmath77-axis , and then we apply landau theory ( landau quantization ) , which quantizes of the cyclotron orbits of charged particles in magnetic field . accordingly , we find that the value of the chiral condensates is suppressed with increasing the magnetic field .    furthermore , in mean field approximation , we have constructed the partition function and then estimated various thermodynamic quantities , such as trace anomaly ( interaction measure ) , speed of sound squared , entropy density , specific heat and the magnetization .",
    "their dependence on temperature highlights the effects of magnetic field on therm in both hadron and parton phases .",
    "we have compared our calculations with recent lattice simulations at vanishing chemical potential and finite magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we conclude that our calculations with a scalar coupling parameter simulate well the lattice qcd calculation in nonzero magnetic field @xcite .    at low temperature , a good agreement between plsm and lattice qcd simulations is found . in this temperature limit , the meson fluctuations in the mean field approximation are dominated .",
    "similarly , at high temperature , the gluon dynamics is not fully accomplished by the polyakov - loop corrections .",
    "this explains the discrepancy with the lattice qcd calculations . as concluded from the hadron resonance gas model @xcite",
    ", the quantities @xmath151 and @xmath120 should not be necessarily identical .",
    "the difference between partial and complete differentiation might partly explain this at least from the mathematical point - of - view .",
    "the physical point - of - view proposes that @xmath151 and @xmath120 do not take into consideration the same types of fluctuations . in an intensive study , tawfik _ et al . _",
    "specified that the main differences between @xmath151 and @xmath120 are the energy fluctuations @xcite . in deriving specific heat",
    ", several types of energy density susceptibilities , fluctuations and multiplicities appear @xcite .",
    "a list of such fluctuations are listed in appendix a of ref @xcite .",
    "an evidence supporting this interpretation has been reported , recently @xcite . the most solid support for this study",
    "is offered by the phenomenological lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath151 and @xmath120 differ from each other , especially below and above @xmath0 . at @xmath152",
    ", @xmath153 is larger than @xmath13 , while at @xmath154 , @xmath13 becomes larger than @xmath153 . at @xmath155 ,",
    "both expressions get very close to each other until they approach the asymptotic value , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "the lattice simulations do not propose any reason why @xmath151 and @xmath120 should not be identical .",
    "we conclude that increasing the magnetic field strength increases the thermodynamic quantities , especially in the hadron phase . at high temperatures , the plsm thermodynamics",
    "is apparently limited below the stefan - boltzmann limits .",
    "furthermore , we find that the quark - hadron phase boundary is shifted to lower values of temperatures with increasing magnetic field strength .    the sign of magnetization signals para- or dia - magnetic property of qcd matter .",
    "the excellent agreement between plsm and recent lattice calculations means that our plsm gives a well - suited description for the degrees of freedom in both hadron and parton phases .",
    "the magnetic field seems to enhance the occurrence of chiral phase - transition due to its contributions to the landau quantizations .",
    "the magnetic field also contributes to the suppression in the chiral condensates relevant to the restoration of the chiral symmetry - breaking .",
    "this suppression is known as the inverse magnetic catalysis and seems to manifest a decrease in the chiral critical temperature with increase magnetic field .",
    "it is noteworthy highlighting that he results estimated from plsm in vanishing and finite magnetic field can be trusted within the limits of the numerical calculations of the plsm order parameters , @xmath156 and @xmath148 in thermal and dense qcd medium . in this regard",
    ", one has to recall that plsm has a temperature - limited applicability depending on the temperature - applicability of its chiral and deconfinement order - parameters . only within this limit the conclusions drawn about the equation of state , the magnetic properties of the qcd matter and the chiral phase - structure , etc",
