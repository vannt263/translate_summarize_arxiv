    "a statistical calculation of hadron multiplicities in high energy collisions has been developed in ref .",
    "the shm relies on the assumption of equiprobability of multi - hadronic states originating from hadronising clusters , entailing that particle production in hadronisation of both elementary ( ec ) and heavy ion ( hic ) collisions can be treated as an equilibrium process .",
    "the main advantage of the model is the low number of free parameters necessary to reproduce the observed hadron multiplicities .",
    "these are : the total volume @xmath2 of the set of clusters , temperature @xmath3 , and a phenomenological parameter @xmath4 reducing the production of strange particles with respect to a fully chemically equilibrated hadron gas . the exact conservation of initial electric , baryon and strange total quantum charges is enforced in the model .",
    "however , when dealing with hic , the conservation of the initial baryon number can be imposed only on the average and the baryon chemical potential @xmath5 has to be introduced .",
    "a remarkable outcome of the shm is that the temperature fitted in any ec is almost constant ( @xmath6 mev ) , and very close to that obtained in hic with small fitted @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , for different hic , to an increase of the fitted value of @xmath5 corresponds a decrease of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "an interesting insight in strangeness production is obtained when studying the so - called wroblewski factor , the ratio between newly produced valence strange and light quark pairs @xmath7 , which is fairly constant in several ec , with @xmath8 spanning two orders of magnitude , whereas it is significantly higher and more variable in hic  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : ls ] ) .",
    "the peculiar behaviour of @xmath9 , together with the apparent universality of the scale of temperature fitted within ec , suggest to look for a more fundamental description of strangeness production , by employing effective models ( em ) having quarks as fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "in using em , the same physical scheme of the shm is kept .",
    "however , we now assume the formation of a set of hadronising clusters endowed with given @xmath10 and color charges , in which every allowed quantum state is equally likely .",
    "the assumption of suitable maximum disorder fluctuations of cluster flavor charges is retained  @xcite , which allows to impose exact flavor conservation over the total volume @xmath2 .",
    "further conjectures are introduced :    1 .   temperature @xmath3 and baryon chemical potential @xmath5 , fitted within the shm , are interpreted as the critical values for deconfinement and ( approximate ) chiral symmetry restoration 2 .",
    "the produced s quarks , or at least the ratio s / u , survive in the hadronic phase 3 .",
    "each single cluster is a color singlet    the first assumption is the strongest one , as it implies that hadronisation itself is assumed to be a critical process .",
    "the aforementioned constancy of fitted temperature for many collisions  @xcite and the consistency with other estimates , support this identification .",
    "assumption ( 2 ) implies that full chemical equilibrium is assumed at constituent quark level .",
    "thus , no parameter such as @xmath4 is now required to account for strangeness production .",
    "conversely , assumption ( 3 ) introduces a further parameter , a characteristic cluster size @xmath11 over which color is exactly conserved , which , together with the constancy of @xmath3 and a weak dependence of @xmath9 itself on the total volume @xmath2 , contributes in stabilizing @xmath9 for ec . on the other hand ,",
    "a large @xmath11 in hic could be a signal for color deconfinement over large volumes .",
    "the simplest effective model to start with is the thermal nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite .",
    "it can not account for deconfinement but it does embody chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration ( @xmath12sr ) , which is expected to occur at the same critical point  @xcite . although not renormalizable , the njl model shares the main features with other effective models , referred in literature as _ ladder_-qcd  @xcite .",
    "actually the phase diagram for @xmath12sr exhibits a tricritical point in the chiral limit , separating second order from first order phase transitions .",
    "we are interested to include the current quark masses , in which case a smooth cross - over transition is expected for the light quarks in the second order region ( in which we are interested in the present work ) .",
    "this implies a quasi - critical behavior of the light quark condensates and a smooth decrease of the strange one for higher temperatures .",
    "the same happens to the constituent quark masses which are the physical quantities , together with the uv cutoff @xmath13  @xcite , affecting the number of quarks ( or antiquarks ) .",
    "actually , the thermodynamics of the mean - field njl model can be derived by a free dirac hamiltonian having constituent quark masses replacing the current ones .",
    "the dependence of quark multiplicities on @xmath14 emerges when requiring exact conservation of quantum flavor and color charges by restricting the partition function to the allowed set of multi - particle states .",
    "this is accomplished by means of standard methods  @xcite and implies a five - dimensional integration over the group @xmath15 .",
    "calculations are shown in detail in ref .",
    "for hic , the fitted total volumes  @xcite are large enough to disregard the fluctuations of flavor quantum numbers . then , if @xmath11 is large enough , it can be explicitly checked that a grand - canonical calculation of quark multiplicities is reliable .",
    "this implies that @xmath9 can be obtained by the simple grand - canonical formula for a gas of free constituent quarks with an uv cutoff limiting the momentum integration  @xcite , and it is independent on @xmath14 .",
    "temperature @xmath3 and chemical potentials @xmath16 are taken coincident with those fitted within the shm . a first comparison with the shm predictions can be performed by considering the values of the constituent quark masses @xmath17 for the strange quark ( @xmath18 ) and for a light quark @xmath19 @xmath20 ) with mass @xmath21 , as free parameters to be determined imposing the shm value of @xmath9 for a given process .",
    "a more complete analysis can be obtained by using the thermal njl model in a predictive way .",
    "the coincidence of the cross - over point with the best fit of the shm is possible by tuning the parameter @xmath22 , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , which controls the strength of the six - fermion term and which physically represents the critical temperature for @xmath23 restoration .",
    "then the cross - over line , obtained by studying the chiral light quark susceptibility can be compared with the fitted values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 in the shm , as well as @xmath9 along the critical line . in this case",
    "the constituent masses @xmath24 are predicted by minimizing the njl grand canonical potential .",
    "a good agreement is found with @xmath25170 mev for various hic .    however , as it turns out that @xmath26 is almost independent on the choice of @xmath22 , the model needs the specification of only one parameter , either @xmath22 or @xmath27 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ bande ] , which shows , on the other hand , that under the reasonable assumption that the light quark constituent mass has sensibly decreased at the cross - over point , the agreement with the shm is guaranteed by @xmath28 mev . the limit @xmath29 serves to show that the uv contribution is not expected to change this picture , even if the analysis in renormalizable models such as _ ladder_-qcd  @xcite is necessary .",
    "the location of the cross - over point for ec , @xmath30 mev ( @xmath31 ) , as well as @xmath17 , are obtained in the predictive njl model with @xmath32 mev in the infinite volume limit .",
    "consequently , quark multiplicities depend on the volume only through the explicit dependence of the canonical partition function on @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "this approximation already allows us to observe canonical suppression .",
    "we find consistency with our physical picture , as far as processes with zero initial electric charge are concerned , whereas for pp collisions the pauli exclusion principle and canonical suppression balance each other and @xmath9 remains constant around @xmath33 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : epem ] we plot the predictions of the model compared to the shm expectations for collisions .",
    "we have studied strangeness production within a statistical model of hadronisation by using an effective model with constituent quarks .",
    "the study supports the idea that the shm analysis may help in effective models building for the qcd phase transition , whereas em may give a natural explanation of strangeness suppression in ec , assuming full chemical equilibrium , as due to the absence of baryon chemical potential and to canonical suppression working in small volumes .",
    "a significative discrepancy is found only in pp collisions , where further analysis is required ."
