    "the _ ab initio _ description of light nuclear systems , starting from the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , requires well established methods to solve the schrdinger equation . among them ,",
    "the green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method has been extensively used to describe light nuclei up to @xmath3 and the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) up to @xmath4  @xcite . in the @xmath5 systems ,",
    "well established methods for treating both bound and scattering states exist as the faddeev equations ( @xmath6 ) and the faddeev - yakubovsky equations ( @xmath7 ) in configuration or momentum space , and the hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) expansion .",
    "all these methods have proven to be of great accuracy and they have been tested using different benchmarks  @xcite .    the hh method provides a systematic way of constructing a complete basis for the expansion of the @xmath0-particle wave function and its use in the @xmath8 systems has been subject of intense investigations over the last years . in the specific case of application to nuclear physics , the wave function has to be antisymmetric and , therefore , the hh basis has been managed to produce basis states having well defined properties under particle permutations .",
    "different schemes to construct hyperspherical functions with an arbitrary permutational symmetry are given in refs .",
    "recently , a procedure for constructing hh functions in terms of a single particle basis has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a different approach",
    ", the authors have used the hh basis , without a previous symmetrization procedure , to describe bound states in three- and four - particle systems  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian matrix reflects the symmetries present in it , even if it has been constructed using the non - symmetrized basis . the only requirement was to include all the hh basis elements having the same grand angular quantum number @xmath9 .",
    "it is a property of the hh basis that basis elements having well defined behavior under particle permutation can be constructed as a linear combination of hh elements having the same value of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , if the hamiltonian commutes with the group of permutations of @xmath0 objects , @xmath10 , the diagonalization procedure generates eigenvectors having well defined permutation symmetry that can be organized in accordance with the irreducible representations of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , identifying those eigenvectors with the desired symmetry , the corresponding energies can be considered variational estimates . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was possible to identify a subset of eigenvectors and eigenvalues corresponding exactly to those that would be obtained performing the preliminary symmetrization of the states .",
    "it should be noticed that the simplicity of using the hh basis without a preliminary antisymmetrization step , has to be counterbalanced with the large dimension of the matrices to be diagonalized .",
    "however , at present , different techniques are available to treat ( at least partially ) this problem .    in the present article",
    "we continue the study of the non - symmetrized hh basis , extending the applications to systems with @xmath8 . in pursuit of this goal",
    ", we have developed a particular representation of the hamiltonian matrix , which is systematic with respect to the number of particles and well suited for a numerical implementation .",
    "as mentioned , one of the main problem in using the hh basis is its large degeneracy , resulting in very large matrices .",
    "on the other hand , the potential energy matrix , expressed as a sum of pairwise interactions , can not connect arbitrary basis elements differing in some specific quantum numbers .",
    "this means that in some representation each pairwise - interaction term has to be represented by a sparse matrix .",
    "for example , the matrix representation of the potential @xmath11 , constructed in terms of basis elements in which the quantum numbers of particles @xmath12 are well defined , is sparse in @xmath13 systems .",
    "in fact , its matrix elements connecting basis elements with different quantum numbers labelling states which do not involve particles @xmath12 are zero .",
    "a problem arises when the matrix elements of the generic term @xmath14 , defining the interaction between particles @xmath15 , has to be calculated using basis elements in which the quantum numbers of particles @xmath15 are not well defined .",
    "one operative way to solve this problem consists in rotating the basis to a system of coordinates in which particles @xmath15 have well defined quantum numbers .",
    "this makes the matrix @xmath14 sparse .",
    "however , we would like the rotation matrix to be sparse too , which in general it is not true .",
    "this last problem is solved noticing that the rotation matrix can be expressed as a product of sparse matrices , each one representing a rotation which involves a permutation of particles of successive numbering . after these manipulations the potential energy matrix results in a sum of products of sparse matrices suitable for numerical implementations .",
    "an advantage in using the non - symmetrized hh basis appears when symmetry breaking terms are present in the hamiltonian . in the case of the nuclear hamiltonian with charge - symmetry breaking terms",
    ", this means that different total isospin components @xmath16 are present in the wave function .",
    "for example , the three - nucleon bound state wave function includes @xmath17 components and the four - nucleon bound state wave function includes @xmath18 components , requiring the inclusion of different spatial symmetries in the wave function .",
    "therefore , considering all the possible spin and isospin components , the number of hh states having well defined spatial symmetries , necessary to construct the wave function , and the dimension of the non - symmetrized basis is comparable .",
    "high isospin components are in general a small part of the total wave function .",
    "they are difficult to include in the antisymmetrized basis since appreciably increases the number of basis elements and , at the same time , they improve very little the description of the state . in practical cases",
    "they are disregarded , or partially included , with the consequence that the occupation probabilities of the high isospin states are not always well determined ( see ref .",
    "conversely , using the non - symmetrized basis , all the isospin components are automatically generated .",
    "as an example we will show results for @xmath1 systems using short - range central interactions with and without the inclusion of the coulomb potential .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we present the implementation of the non - symmetrized hh basis for @xmath0-body system using the factorization of the potential energy matrix mentioned before . in order to give a detailed description of this construction",
    ", we consider only spatial degrees of freedom ; accordingly , we show examples using a central interaction .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian produces eigenvectors organized in multiplets of the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation of @xmath10 , and the different symmetries will be identified using the appropriate casimir operator .",
    "not all the states belonging to a particular representation can be antisymmetrized using the spin - isospin functions of @xmath0 nucleons and , therefore , these states are not physical .",
    "it should be noticed that the physical states could appear in very high positions of the spectrum , in particular this is the case for @xmath8 systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the iterative methods , as the lanczos method , used to search selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large matrices are more efficient for the extreme ones . to this respect ,",
    "we have found very convenient to use the symmetry - adapted lanczos method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which restricts the search to those states having a particular symmetry . when possible , comparisons to different results in the literature will be done .",
    "since we have in mind the description of light nuclear systems using realistic interactions , this study can be considered a preliminary step in the use of this technique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; section [ sec : hh ] is devoted to a brief description of the hh basis . in sections",
    "[ sec : pot ] the expression for the potential energy matrix in terms of hh states is given . in section [ sec : results ] the results for the models proposed are shown .",

    "though the use of a central potential leads to an unrealistic description of the light nuclei structures , the study has served to analyze the characteristic of the method : the capability of the diagonalization procedure to construct the proper symmetry of the state and the particular structure , in terms of products of sparse matrices , of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the success of this study makes feasible the extension of the method to treat interactions depending on spin and isospin degrees of freedom as the realistic nn potentials .",
    "a preliminary analysis in this direction has been done  @xcite . to this respect",
    "it is important to notice that the information of the potential is given in the matrix @xmath181 defined in eq.([eq : v12 ] ) .",
    "once this matrix is given , the method remains the same , with the basis enlarged to include spin and isospin degrees of freedom if required . using the volkov potential we have shown that it was possible to identify all the physical states and the corresponding thresholds in order to interpret the level as bounded or belonging to the continuum .",
    "furthermore , the results obtained using the volkov potential up to @xmath293 compare well with other techniques . a few characteristic of the @xmath1 systems using the volkov potential",
    "are the following .",
    "due to its particular parametrization",
    "a shallow state appears in the @xmath212 systems when the coulomb interaction is not considered . in the @xmath6 this state",
    "has the characteristic of an efimov state .",
    "when the coulomb interaction is considered these states move to the continuum .",
    "the volkov potential acting in all waves produces large binding energies as @xmath0 increases .",
    "accordingly we have included in the analysis the @xmath2-wave version of the potential . in agreement with the experimental observations",
    ", this version predicts in reasonable positions the @xmath7 @xmath253 and @xmath260 resonances and no bound states in the @xmath194 system .",
    "it also predicts reasonable binding energies in the @xmath293 system .",
    "the extension of the method to consider realistic potentials is in progress .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is obtained by means of an iterative algorithm which requires only the action of the hamiltonian matrix on a given vector .",
    "we used the lanczos algorithm in the version invented by cullum and willoughby  @xcite which is particularly sparing with memory use . in principle , the iterative procedure should preserve the permutation symmetry of the input vector , as the hamiltonian commutes with the group elements .",
    "however , the round - off errors generate components also in the other irreducible representations . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have used a symmetry adapted lanczos ( sal ) developed in ref .",
    "@xcite in which a projection operator is applied after each iterative step .",
    "starting from a random initial vector , in the usual lancsoz recurrence formula @xmath317 the product @xmath318 is replaced by @xmath319}h{\\bm v}_i$ ] , where @xmath320}$ ] is a projector on a sub - space with a non - zero intersection with the irreducible representation @xmath209 $ ] , and zero intersection with the irreducible representations of the lower - eigenvector symmetries .",
