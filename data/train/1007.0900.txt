    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by accretion onto a central supermassive blackhole . according to the unified model ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) , an optically - thick torus of dust and gas surrounds this central engine .",
    "hence orientation of the system plays a central role in determining the observable features of agn . in type 1 agn ,",
    "the system is oriented face - on , leaving an unobstructed view of the central engine and the broad line region .",
    "in contrast , type 2 agn are oriented edge - on , blocking the accretion disk and the broad line region .",
    "these obscured agn can be identified by their narrow optical and mid - infrared emission lines which originate in gas photoionized by accretion disk photons .",
    "this narrow line region ( nlr ) extends hundreds of parsecs away from the central source and is therefore not significantly affected by torus obscuration .    the luminosity of emission lines formed in the narrow line region can therefore be used as isotropic indicators of intrinsic agn luminosity .",
    "the flux of the [ oiii]@xmath05007 line is commonly used as such a diagnostic ( e.g. bassani et al .",
    "1999 , heckman et al . 2005 ) as it is one of the most prominent lines and suffers little contamination from star formation processes in the host galaxy .",
    "this line can be attenuated by dust in the host galaxy , though this effect can be somewhat remedied by applying a reddening correction using the observed balmer decrement ( i.e. the observed ratio of the narrow h@xmath9/h@xmath10 emission - lines compared to the intrinsic ratio ) and the extinction curve for galactic dust @xcite .",
    "isotropic indicators of agn luminosity also exist in the infrared band and are much less affected by dust extinction than the optical [ oiii ] line .",
    "recently , the luminosity of the [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath1 m line has been shown to be a robust proxy of agn power ( e.g. melndez et al .",
    "2008 , rigby et al .",
    "2009 , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 ) : it is formed in the nlr , so it is not affected by torus obscuration , and with an ionization potential of 54.9 ev , starburst activity does not significantly contribute to this line .",
    "agn also emit over 20% of their bolometric flux in the mid - infrared ( mir ) , where photons produced by the continuum are absorbed by the torus and re - radiated ( e.g. spinoglio & malkan 1989 ) . this mir emission from the dusty torus can also be a proxy for the intrinsic agn luminosity .",
    "two potential issues with the mir continuum are contamination by emission from dust heated by stars ( e.g. buchanan et al .",
    "2006 ; deo et al . 2009 ) and possible anisotropy in the torus emission ( e.g. pier & krolik 1992 , buchanan et al .",
    "2006 , elitzur & shlosman 2006 , nenkova et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "radio and hard x - ray ( e @xmath2 10 kev ) flux can serve as proxies of the intrinsic agn continuum . radio emission has been shown to be similar between type 1 and type 2 agn ( e.g. giuricin et al .",
    "1990 , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 , melndez et al . 2010 ) and correlated with optical luminosity , in particularly the [ oiii ] flux @xcite , making high resolution radio observations that isolate emission from the nucleus another diagnostic of intrinsic agn power .",
    "hard x - rays can pierce through the obscuring torus , provided that the object is not heavily compton thick ( n@xmath11 @xmath12 ) , and has therefore been used as a method to select agn samples ( e.g. winter et al .",
    "2008 , treister et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "connections have been observed between star formation activity in the host galaxy and the central agn ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 2003 ) .",
    "starburst activity can be parametrized by various ir features , such as the equivalent width ( ew ) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "ir and optical data , such as the ratio of fine structure lines and the shape of the spectral slope , can also reveal the relative amount of agn to starburst activity .",
    "samples of seyfert 2 galaxies ( the predominant local class of type 2 agn ) are useful in examining the relationships among these star formation vs. agn - to - starburst indicators as the obscuration of the central engine allows detailed study of the host galaxy .    to address these issues , we will use two complete and homogeneous sy2 samples selected based on isotropic indicators of agn luminosity ( one [ oiii]-selected sample and one mir - selected sample ) .",
    "we will compare the various diagnostics of intrinsic agn luminosity and probe for biases resulting from sample selection criteria , starburst contamination , errors introduced from extinction correction , and scatter due to the various physical mechanisms producing these emission features .",
    "such biases are likely minimized in the diagnostic ratios with the smallest dispersion .",
    "where available , we compare these ratios with the sy1 values to probe for differences due to the inclination of the system , thus testing to which extent these indicators of intrinsic agn luminosity are truly `` isotropic . ''",
    "we will also test the agreement among mid - infrared and optical star formation indicators .",
    "finally , we will examine the possibility that the fraction of the agn ionizing luminosity that is converted into [ oiii ] and [ oiv ] emission is systematically higher in systems in which there is a copious supply of dense gas associated with starburst activity .",

    "we used pahfit @xcite to measure the pah ews , a program which uses a model consisting of several components : a starlight component represented by blackbody emission at t = 5000 k , a thermal dust continuum constrained to default temperature bins ( 35 , 40 , 50 , 65 , 135 , 200 and 300 k ) , ir emission lines , pah ( dust ) features and extinction ( we used a foreground extinction screen ) .",

    "we compared our results with the 11.2@xmath1 m feature from wu et al .",

    "of the 28 sources we have in common with wu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , 12 of them had consistent 11.3@xmath1 m ew values ( within a factor of 2 ) , 6 had lower values than we obtained ( which would be expected from the disagreements between the spline vs. decomposition methods mentioned above ) and 10 had higher values , where for 6 of these , pahfit had obtained an ew value of zero , yet the spline method yielded a measurement . comparing our results with gallimore et al .",

    "such differences could account for the inconsistencies in our pah ew measurements .",
    "though the derived ews are different from those reported by wu et al . and gallimore et al .",
    "for at least half the sources we have in common , our main conclusions based on pah ews agree qualitatively with wu et al . and gallimore et al .",
    ": pah features are associated with other star formation activity indicators ( gallimore et al .",
    "2010 , wu et al .",
    "2009 ) and the ews are inversely correlated to the strength of the ionization field ( wu et al .",
    "2009 where they use the _ iras _ colors to parameterize agn strength ) .    in the discussion that follows",
    ", we divide the 12@xmath1m - sample into two classes , those with weak pah emission ( `` pah - weak '' sources ) and those with strong pah emission ( `` pah - strong '' sources , galaxies with ew @xmath2 1 @xmath1 m in either the 11.3 @xmath1 m or 17@xmath1 m band , with pah ews detected in both bands ) ; the strong pah emission is likely due to starburst activity in the host galaxy ( see @xmath265.2 ) .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the relative efficacy of the five different proxies for the agn intrinsic luminosity under consideration in this paper .",
    "we expect that these different proxies will not agree perfectly , due to the different physical mechanisms that produce and affect the emission features as well as biases resulting from sample selection , starburst contamination , statistical errors and in some cases , uncertain application of extinction corrections . to address this , we will undertake two kinds of comparions .    first , we will use our two sy2 samples to inter - compare these proxies in a pair - wise fashion and measure the amount of scatter in the corresponding flux ratios . which proxies agree best with one another ?",
    "second , we will compare these pairs of flux ratios to the corresponding values for unobscured type 1 agn to test which proxies are more `` isotropic , '' i.e. suffer the least agn - viewing - angle dependence .",
    "figures [ hist_o4_o3 ] - [ xray_radio ] show the histograms of a subset of ratios for the five proxies . in each plot",
    ", the solid black line represents both samples combined , the red dashed line and green dotted - dashed line delineate the 12@xmath1 m sample ( `` pah - weak '' and `` pah - strong '' sources respectively ) and the cyan filled histogram reflects the [ oiii]-sample .",
    "adjacent to these histograms are the luminosity vs. luminosity plots , showing the correlation between these indicators : the cyan asterisks represent the [ oiii ] sample , the red diamonds ( green triangles ) depict the `` pah - weak '' ( `` pah - strong '' ) 12@xmath1 m sources , and the dashed black line represents the best fit from multiple linear regression analysis ( i.e. the regress routine in idl ) , where in the figure captions , @xmath27 is the linear regression coefficient and p@xmath28 is the probability that the two quantities are uncorrelated . though the distance dependence in luminosity vs. luminosity plots enhances the correlation compared to flux vs. flux plots , we employed this method as the 12@xmath1 m sample lies at a systematically lower redshift , and thus have higher flux values , than the [ oiii ] sample .",
    "one of our main goals is to examine the dispersion in the flux ratios , where this distance dependence cancels out . in @xmath264.3 , we test if these ratios are affected by luminosity .    where available , the values for sy1s are included in these plots .",
    "the results are summarized in tables [ diag_results1 ] and [ diag_results2 ] which lists the mean and sigma of each ratio for the combined sample and the sub - samples separately . in the histograms and luminosity plots ,",
    "the upper limits are plotted but not included in the analysis of the mean and sigma ( except for the ratios involving the hard x - ray flux ) .",
    "since only 12 of the 51 agn were detected in hard x - rays , we have employed survival analysis to quantify the correlations among the proxies and to calculate the mean of the ratios .",
    "this approach takes the upper - limits into account ( asurv rev 1.2 , isobe and feigelson 1990 ; lavalley , isobe and feigelson 1992 ; for univariate problems using the kaplan - meier estimator , feigelson and nelson 1985 ; for bivariate problems , isobe et al .",

    "a wider spread is present between the radio and hard x - ray fluxes compared with the optical and mir values .    in all cases ,",
    "a wider dispersion is present between all the flux ratios in the 12@xmath1 m sample as compared to the [ oiii ] sample .",
    "below , we examine whether such a scatter could be due to aperture effects , extinction corrections applied to the [ oiii ] flux , starburst contamination to the the mir flux or if it represents a real difference between agn selected on the basis of [ oiii ] flux versus mir flux .    since the 12@xmath1 m sy2s are typically more nearby than the [ oiii]-selected galaxies , aperture effects can potentially play a significant role when comparing flux values by either missing nlr flux or obtaining too much host galaxy contamination . however , we find no evidence in our data for such an effect ( see appendix ) .",
    "another possible explanation for this wider dispersion is that the optical data for the 12@xmath1 m sample are drawn from the literature , which can introduce scatter into the optical diagnostics as such data are not taken and reduced in a uniform matter .",
    "the most striking example of this is the comparison of the [ oiv ] flux with the observed and extinction corrected [ oiii]-flux : de - reddening the [ oiii]-flux widens the dispersion in the 12@xmath1m - sample ( see figure [ hist_o4_o3 ] ) .",
    "this can be an artifact of using literature h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 values and to a lesser extent can be due to large amounts of dust in the host galaxies of the 12@xmath1 m sample as evidenced by the wide range of balmer decrements .",
    "goulding and alexander ( 2009 ) note that galaxies that would not be identified optically as agn ( i.e. have a low `` d '' value , see @xmath265.1 ) tend to have similar balmer decrements yet higher f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] ratios than optically identified agn .",
    "this result suggests that applying a reddening correction using the balmer decrement still under - represents the intrinsic [ oiii ] flux .",
    "however , our 12@xmath1 m sources with lower `` d '' values ( @xmath301.2 ) do not show systematically higher f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] ratios ( see figure [ balmer ] ) , indicating that `` extra '' extinction that goulding and alexander observe in their sources is not present in ours .",
    "as expected , the ratio of f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] increases with h@xmath9/h@xmath10 , denoting that both quantities trace host galaxy extinction , though with wide scatter .",
    "comparison with the locus of points for the [ oiii ] sample shows that the balmer decrement is systematically higher for similar 12@xmath1 m f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] values , suggesting that the the 12@xmath1 m balmer decrements are over - estimating the amount of dust present rather than under - estimating .",

    "also results in large scatter that is systematically higher than that observed in the [ oiii ] sample for all but three of the flux ratios .",
    "a similarly wide spread between f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] is present in other samples ( i.e. melndez et al . 2008 and",
    "diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 ) , indicating that sample selection based on [ oiii ] is primarily responsible for the tighter correlations we observe .",
    "this may be due to less extinction in the nlr region which would be expected in sources that have high observed [ oiii ] flux .",
    "- _ extinction correction _ applying an extinction correction to the [ oiii ] flux tightens the correlations with the other luminosity indicators for the [ oiii]-selected sample , yet broadens the dispersion for the 12@xmath1 m sample .",
    "it is not clear whether this difference is primarily due to the different sources of the emission - line data ( homogenous sdss data for the [ oiii ] sample and heterogeneous data for the 12@xmath1 m sample ) , or whether it simply points out the limitations of extinction corrections in very dusty agn .",
    "comparison of the optical vs. mir properties of the most dusty agn in the sdss suggest that the former effect is important ( wild et al .",
    "2010 ) .    - _ agreement among sy2s _ the observed [ oiii ] , [ oiv ] and mir luminosities agree the best in the combined sy2 sample .",
    "the widest spread among the various proxies is seen in the radio emission .",
    "the x - ray data are dominated by upper limits , but also show a significantly larger dispersion than the optical and ir isotropic flux indicators .",
    "- _ comparison with sy1s _ the mean ratio of the observed [ oiii ] flux to the [ oiv ] flux is lower in sy2 than in sy1s by a factor of 1.5 - 2 , while the mean ratio of the observed [ oiii ] flux to mir is consistent between sy2s and sy1s . the former result , which represents a statistically significant difference between sy1s and sy2s according to the ks test but not kuiper s test , agrees with previous findings ( e.g. haas et al . 2005 , melndez et al . 2008 , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 ) and has been interpreted as extinction affecting [ oiii ] in the nlr , or even torus obscuration attenuating the [ oiii ] emission ( baum et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , the latter result can not be simply explained by a larger amount of dust extinction of [ oiii ] in the sy2s , but it could be due to a slight anisotropy in the mir emission as predicted by pier & krolik ( 1992 ) and nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008 ) where sy1s could have up to a factor of two higher mir flux as compared to sy2s .",
    "the wide scatter in these ratios can also be responsible for the discrepancy between the f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] and f@xmath24/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] values , which may be the main driver for the mild disagreement rather than torus emission anisotropy .",
    "the f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath32 and f@xmath24/f@xmath32 mean values are consistent between sy1 and sy2 galaxies ( in agreement with diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 and melndez et al .",
    "2010 for the [ oiv ] and radio comparison ) , though the slopes of the luminosity plots show disagreements and there is wide scatter which is expected due to the wide range of radio loudness observed in agns .",
    "- _ hard x - ray selected samples _ we find that the hard x - ray flux ( relative to the [ oiii ] , [ oiv ] , and mir fluxes ) is suppressed by about an order - of - magnitude in mir selected sy2s compared to both sy1s ( consistent with rigby et al .",
    "2008 ) and to hard x - ray selected type 2 agn ( winter et al .",
    "2010 and weaver et al .",
    "the comparison with the [ oiii ] sample is mixed , with statistically significant differences between the sy2s and sy1s when the x - ray flux is normalized by the [ oiv ] and mir flux , but not when normalized by the [ oiii ] flux .",
    "however , hard x - ray selected sy2s differ significantly from [ oiii]-selected sy2s ( though with only one [ oiii ] sy2 detected by bat , this analysis may be less robust than the 12@xmath1 m comparison ) .",
    "these results indicate that hard x - ray emission ( e @xmath2 10 kev ) is anistropic and hard x - ray selected samples are biased against the more heavily obscured type 2 agn that are present in mir and possibly [ oiii ] selected samples . as weaver et al .",
    "( 2010 ) note for sources detected in hard x - rays , compton scattering could be responsible for the hard x - ray attenuation observed in type 2 agn as compared to type 1 . in more obscured sources ,",
    "compton scattering may be pushing them below the flux sensitivity of bat .",
    "f@xmath24 and f@xmath29}$ ] agree the best , both in comparison with the other indicators in the combined sy2 sample ( having the least scatter ) and in having a nearly identical flux ratio in sy2s and sy1s as well as not suffering from a luminosity bias . among the indicators we have considered , they are the best proxies for truly isotropic agn emission .",
    "we tested the level of agreement of various optical and infrared indicators of star formation activity compared with proxies of agn activity .",
    "similar to previous works , we find statistically significant relations among the various indicators of the relative energetic significance of star formation and an agn .",
    "these include the mir spectral slope ( parametrized by @xmath43 ) , the pah ews at 11.3@xmath1 m and 17@xmath1 m , the ratio of [ oiv]/[neii ] fluxes , and the location of the galaxy in the commonly used diagnostic diagram based on optical emission - lines .",
    "we note that the last two diagnostics are a measure of the relative contribution of agn vs. starburst activity to the incident ionizing radiation .",
    "as the incident radiation field becomes more dominated by the agn activity , the pahs become weaker relative to the mir continuum . in part",
    "this is expected because of the``dilution '' of the mir continuum by agn - heated dust , but the agn may also be directly affecting the pah emission ( e.g. odowd et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we also found that the sy2s that were clearly starburst / agn composites based on the above indicators were systematically those cases in which large - scale mir emission from the host galaxy greatly exceeded that from the agn .",
    "we quantified this by comparing the ratio of the 12@xmath1 m flux from the large _ iras _ aperture with the 15.5@xmath1 m flux from the small _ irs _ aperture .",
    "a smaller aperture is therefore necessary to isolate agn emission in systems with high rates of star formation on large scales and/or low agn luminosities .",
    "the ratios of the [ oiii]/mir and [ oiv]/mir fluxes show little if any evidence for a correlation with any of the above measures of the relative amount of star formation .",
    "this lack of a relationship suggests that the [ oiii ] and [ oiv ] lines are not biased to be a preferentially higher fraction of the agn bolometric luminosity in host galaxies with more star formation activity ( more dense gas ) .",

    "as the optical data for the 12@xmath1 m sample were culled from the literature , we examined the data to see if an aperture bias was evident .",
    "the aperture sizes used for the optical data ( @xmath125 ) ranged from 3 to 14  for the 12@xmath1 m sources and was 3  for all the sdss sy2s . for several of our sources",
    ", we found the size of the nlr ( @xmath126 ) from schmitt et al ( 2003a ) and estimated the nlr for the remainder using log @xmath127 = ( 0.31 @xmath22 0.04 ) @xmath6 log @xmath128}$ ] - 10.08 @xmath22 1.80 ( schmitt et al 2003b ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ ap_nlr ] ( same color coding as figure 1 in the main text ) , the aperture was large enough to encompass the full nlr for all sources .",
    "hence , we are not `` missing '' any of the nlr optical flux .    but are we observing too much [ oiii ] flux , perhaps from starburst contamination in the host galaxy which would affect [ oiii ] emission more than [ oiv ] ? if this is the case , we would expect the f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] ratio to decrease as the projected size of the aperture increases and the `` pah - strong '' sources to lie at systematically higher aperture sizes",
    ". however , neither of these trends are apparent ( figure [ o3_o4_ap ] ) , reaffirming the results in the main text where we find no evidence for starburst bias on [ oiii ] emission .",
    "we also note that the opposite effect is also absent , namely increase of f@xmath29}$]/f@xmath16,obs}$ ] with aperture size .",
    "this indicates that though the [ oiv ] flux is collected from the long - high module which has a larger aperture than the [ oiii ] data , the [ oiv ] flux is not produced in regions outside of the nlr .",
    "hence the dispersion present in the flux ratios is not due to sampling the galaxies at different scales between the separate ir and optical observations .",
    "as discussed in the main text , in many cases the spitzer irs data show evidence for the presence of both an agn and active star formation .",
    "this implies that the mir continuum will include emission from warm dust heated by both the agn and massive stars .",
    "since we are interested in using the mir luminosity as an indicator of the intrinsic luminosity of the agn , we would need a way to subtract off the contribution from the dust heated by stars .",
    "we attempted to make this correction by using a simple dilution model based on the ew of the pah features bracketing the continuum around 15.5@xmath1 m ( the pah ew complexes at 11.3@xmath1 m and 17@xmath1 m , c.f .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "1998 , wu et al .",
    "this approach assumes that for starbursts there is a simple linear relationship between the pah luminosity and that of the mir continuum , and that the only effect of the agn is to produce an additional source of mir continuum emission , while not affecting the pah luminosity .",
    "as we have shown , the pah ews are indeed correlated with other indicators of star formation activity .",
    "we therefore compared the average pah ews for starburst galaxies ( @xmath129=2.87 and @xmath130=1.74 , odowd et al .",
    "2009 ; treyer private communication ) to the measured ews for our sy2s and used this to derive the fraction of the mir emission that is attributed to the agn heating of the torus ( i.e. @xmath131 ) . in most cases ,",
    "this correction was negligible .",
    "however , in the composite ( `` strong pah '' ) agn , this procedure seemed to subtract too much mir flux , leading to poorer agreement with the other proxies and strong systematic trends with agn luminosity ( e.g. figure [ raw_mir ] as compared with figure [ mir2_oiv ] ) .",
    "such results indicate that accurately isolating the amount of mir flux due to the agn in strongly composite systems requires more detailed modeling that takes account of the possible influence of the agn on the pahs themselves . in the tight linear correlation",
    "we see between the uncorrected mir and [ oiv ] luminosities ( figure 3 ) there is no evidence that the strong - pah sources have systematically higher mir luminosities .",
    "taken at face value this would imply that in these sources the starburst does not dominate the mir continuum .",
    "this would in turn imply that the ew of these long - wavelength pahs with respect to the _ pure starburst _",
    "mir continuum is unusually high .",
    "this can not be understood as resulting from the destruction of pahs by the agn ( e.g. treyer et al .",
    "2010 ) , as the effect is in the opposite direction ."
