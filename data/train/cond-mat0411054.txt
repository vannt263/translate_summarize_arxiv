    "the role played by magnetism , particularly the nature of magnetic fluctuations , is one of the central issues of the high - t@xmath3 cuprate physics . nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr )",
    "are believed to provide the basic experimental grounds for a spin - fluctuation mechanism of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "it is worth to note that namely the spin - lattice relaxation rates and the knight shift measurements by the nmr and nqr stimulated the elaboration of the well known antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuation scenario for the cuprates.@xcite nmr first revealed a suppression of the low - energy magnetic excitations below what is called the spin gap temperature . in the underdoped region",
    ", it is thought that above t@xmath3 a pseudo - gap opens up in the spin fluctuation spectrum .",
    "since the spin - gap state is believed to be related to the pairing mechanism , a large number of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the origin of the spin gap . despite some criticism @xcite",
    "the spin - fluctuation scenario continues to be very popular both in the nmr / nqr and htsc community .",
    "however , a conventional approach to the hyperfine coupling and the nuclear resonance in cuprates implies a treatment within simple models usually applied to the conventional metals or vice versa to the weakly covalent and weakly correlated insulator .",
    "the magnetic response is assumed to be provided by the only contribution of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "as in parent antiferromagnetic oxides the cu@xmath4 center with s=1/2 is considered to be a main resonating center whereas the doped holes are considered to form an usual fermi - liquid . meanwhile , a hole doping in the framework of the strongly - correlated scenario results in a formation of the well isolated zhang - rice @xmath5 singlets .",
    "the hyperfine interactions and nmr - nqr experiments in cuprates right up to now are interpreted within the shastri - mila - rice ( smr ) spin hamiltonian.@xcite a conventional approach to the analysis of the @xmath2cu nqr / nmr experiments in the hole - doped cuprates corresponds to the model of uniform lattice and indirectly implies the 100@xmath6 volume fraction of the equivalent resonating nuclei .    despite a great many of experimental and theoretical papers the nature and proper description of the magnetic correlations in cuprates is still a subject of controversy .",
    "results of the recent nqr / nmr experiments for `` classic '' cuprate systems 214 and 123 together with a number of early data cast doubt on a validity of the popular concepts to be widely used as a starting point for analysis of the nuclear resonance and in a more broad sense for many other physical effects .",
    "first , it should be noticed that the @xmath2cu nqr lines in the doped cuprates are sometimes unusually inhomogeneously broadened ( @xmath7 mhz ) , practically irrespective of the doping level.@xcite experimental cu nqr study in 14 , la@xmath8cuo@xmath9 has revealed two distinct cu(2 ) sites ( a and b ) with distinguishing relaxation rates and universal difference in corresponding quadrupole frequencies .",
    "subsequently , a precise measurement of the nuclear relaxation in 14 has revealed a composite structure of the separate cu nqr lines with strong frequency dependence of t@xmath10 across the spectrum . at last ,",
    "first cu nqr measurements have revealed either an unexpectedly small value of the asymmetry parameter @xmath11 or rather large difference of @xmath11 for a and b components .",
    "j. haase et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the broadening of the cu line in 214 system can not be explained by spin effects and evidences the orbital shift modulation of a short - length scale . the full planar oxygen spectra show a correlated modulation of the electric field gradient with the spin susceptibility .",
    "nmr spin - echo double - resonance experiments uncovered the large distribution of the local magnetic fields at the planar cu sites.@xcite they found that a single fluid spin - only picture could not reproduce the experimental data .    above",
    "we address mainly the nmr - nqr studies , however , a close inspection of other magnetic data evidences the same controversies .",
    "the absence of an esr signal is strong evidence that local moments in cuprates do not exist .",
    "the polarised neutron results presented by smith",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated that there is neither an elastic nor a quasi - elastic magnetic response in the normal state of nearly optimally doped yba@xmath8cu@xmath12o@xmath13 .",
    "their data are inconsistent with the existence of local spin magnetic moments in the cuo@xmath8 planes .",
    "little scattering they observed can be assigned to @xmath14 of the cu atoms carrying a spin @xmath15 .",
    "they note that neither the variation in magnitude of the susceptibility in 123 system with oxygen content nor the temperature variation is consistent with the existence of local moments .",
    "the integral intensity of the famous resonanse peak in 123 cuprate does not exceed 1 - 2 % from that for spin - wave resonanse in parent system.@xcite a drastic decreasing of the af susceptibility amplitude as a function of doping is found by ins , that disagrees with nmr data and questions the role of spin fluctuations in htsc as the magnetic fluctuations seem to vanish for samples with largest t@xmath3.@xcite    both the nmr - nqr and neutron measurements can not discriminate between the spin and orbital origin of electron magnetic moments .",
    "thus , we can not definitely state that current experimental data unambiguously confirm the spin nature of the magnetism in the doped cuprates .",
    "furthermore , recently there appeared many indications to the orbital magnetism in cuprates .",
    "possible formation of antiferromagnetism below the superconducting transition temperature was found by several experimental techniques in underdoped 23 and 14.@xcite the relatively small values of the observed magnetic moments @xcite ( @xmath16 ) have indicated an orbital rather than a spin origin of the observed antiferromagnetism .",
    "most recent arpes observation of the circular dichroism in the normal state of underdoped and overdoped pb - bi2212 samples @xcite also may be related to the persistent orbital currents .",
    "the nqr study provides a more direct prove for the formation of orbital magnetism since it is performed in zero magnetic field .",
    "thus , the internal magnetic moments if they are present will result in an nqr line splitting . the first experimental evidence for the formation of the internal magnetic moments in the underdoped three - cuo@xmath8-layer hg@xmath17cu@xmath18ba@xmath8ca@xmath8cu@xmath12o@xmath19 ( hg-1223 ) high - t@xmath3 cuprate superconductor below @xmath20 = 134  k has been presented by breitzke _",
    "et al._@xcite using nqr technique they show that cu nqr - lines split below @xmath20 due to a zeeman splitting originating from the internal magnetic fields within the cuo@xmath8-layers .",
    "these results strongly favor a formation of staggered orbital currents as an origin of the observed phenomenon .",
    "the values of the internal magnetic fields vary from the inner to the outer cuo@xmath8-layer and are of order of several hundred gauss .",
    "note , the fields occur below @xmath20 and their intensities increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "the @xmath21hg knight shift measurements in hgba@xmath8cuo@xmath9 @xcite have revealed very large anisotropic shifts which were assigned to orbital magnetic moments @xmath22 localized on the oxygen positions . the @xmath23 shift distribution in la@xmath24sr@xmath25cuo@xmath26",
    "is found recently to be of @xmath27 ( ! ) origin .",
    "@xcite    in our opinion , these and many other experimental observations point to an inconsistency of a conventional model of the well isolated spin and orbital zhang - rice ( zr ) singlet @xmath5 @xcite believed to be a ground state of the hole - doped cuo@xmath26 center in the cuo@xmath8 layers . here , it should be noted that when speaking of a zhang - rice singlet as being `` well isolated '' , one implies that the @xmath5 ground state for the cuo@xmath26 plaquette with the two holes of the @xmath28 symmetry is well separated from any other excited two - hole states . both , experimental data and theoretical model considerations evidence in favor of the more complicated structure of the valence multiplet for the hole - doped cuo@xmath26 center rather than simple zr singlet albeit namely the latter is a guideline in the overwhelming majority of current model approaches .",
    "so , y. yoshinari _",
    "_ @xcite have undertook the cu nqr study of the isolated hole centers in la@xmath29cu@xmath30li@xmath30o@xmath31 .",
    "their results could be interpreted as convincing evidence of the singlet - triplet structure of the hole center .",
    "the authors have revealed the spin singlet ground state ( s=0 ) and the low lying spin triplet state ( s=1 ) with the singlet - triplet separation @xmath32 ev which is comparable with the cu - cu nearest neighbor exchange integral in parent oxide la@xmath8cuo@xmath26 . an experimental indication to the appreciable role of the o",
    "2p@xmath33 orbitals in the @xmath34o hyperfine coupling was obtained by y.yoshinari.@xcite this implies a complicated nature of the ground state manifold for the cuo@xmath26 center with a significant mixing of the zhang - rice singlet and some other molecular term , whose symmetry should be distinct from @xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion conflicts with the widespread opinion regarding the well isolation of the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "the nature of the valent hole states in doped cuprates is considered as being of great importance for the high-@xmath20 problem .",
    "having solved the problem we could justify the choice of the relevant effective hamiltonian together with the opportunities of a mapping to the single band @xmath35 or hubbard model .",
    "below we show that the outgoing beyond zr model does predict a novel spinless scenario of magnetic response in cuprates .",
    "intrinsic nature of electron and hole centers in oxides is related to the self - trapped charge transfer ( ct ) excitons . both experimental observations and theoretical analysis point to a complex two - component structure of the low - energy ct band near @xmath36 ev in parent insulating cuprates .",
    "@xcite here , we deal with a superposition of rather well - defined one- and two - center ct excitons .",
    "the former is associated with a dipole - allowed transition @xmath37 from the ground state @xmath38 to the purely oxygen non - bonding doublet @xmath39 in the cuo@xmath26 plaquette , which is allowed in the `` in - plane '' polarization @xmath40 .",
    "the latter is attributed to a @xmath41 ct between two neighboring cuo@xmath26 plaquettes with the formation of electron cuo@xmath42 and hole cuo@xmath43 centers . here",
    ", the electron center nominally represents the system of cu@xmath44 and o@xmath45 ions with completely filled shells , whereas the hole one does the system with two @xmath38 holes forming the zhang - rice ( zr ) singlet.@xcite the one - center ct exciton formally consists of the conventional electron center and unconventional hole center with actually two - hole configuration @xmath46 resulting in a spin singlet @xmath47 or triplet term @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "both ct excitons can interact with each other . hence , to describe the @xmath49-structure of both excitons on an equal footing one needs to consider the conventional electron center cuo@xmath42 and unconventional cuo@xmath43 hole center with actual @xmath50 multiplet .",
    "hence , unlike a simple zhang - rice model our model assumes a quasi - degeneracy in the ground state of hole cuo@xmath43 center with two close in energy @xmath51 ( zr - singlet ) and @xmath52 terms of @xmath53 and @xmath46 configurations , respectively .",
    "this implies two near equivalent locations for the additional hole , either in the cu 3d - o 2p hybrid @xmath54 state to form zr singlet @xmath5 , or in a purely oxygen nonbonding doublet @xmath55 state to form the @xmath52 state .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows the term structure of the actual _ valent a - e multiplet _ for hole cuo@xmath43 center together with the single - hole basis orbitals .",
    "these orbitals are defined as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are copper and oxygen molecular orbitals with @xmath59 symmetry .",
    "there are two types of purely oxygen nonbonding orbitals with @xmath60 symmetry : @xmath61 and @xmath39 , respectively , that hybridize with each other ( equally for both types ( @xmath62 ) of such orbitals ) : @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is an effective transfer integral with @xmath67 , @xmath68 being two types of @xmath69 transfer integrals , for @xmath70 and @xmath33 bonding , respectively ( @xmath71 for dominantly @xmath70 , or @xmath33 orbital , respectively .",
    "interestingly , that @xmath72 orbitals could form two types of circular current @xmath73-like states : @xmath74 , respectively , with ising - like orbital moment @xmath75 or two types of currentless @xmath76-like @xmath77 states with a quenched orbital moment .",
    "center together with single - hole basis @xmath38 and @xmath78 orbitals , width=321 ]    the a - e model with a @xmath79 competition goes essentially beyond the well - known zr model . in a sense",
    ", the valence @xmath80 multiplet for the hole center represents an unconventional state with cu valence resonating between cu@xmath81 and cu@xmath4 , or `` ionic - covalent '' bonding . in other words",
    ", we deal with a specific version of the `` correlation '' polaron , introduced by goodenough and zhou .",
    "@xcite such centers are characterized by strong coupling with lattice and can reveal the ( pseudo)jahn - teller effect.@xcite    the orbital doublet terms @xmath52 for hole cuo@xmath43 center are straightforwardly derived from two - hole @xmath82 configuration , whereas the configurational interaction is surely to be taken into account when deriving the zr singlet @xmath5 . for the reasonable values of parameters ( in ev ) : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite its wave function can be written as follows @xmath89 where three @xmath90-like configuration are mixed .",
    "this function reflects the well - known result that the zr - singlet represents a two - hole configuration with one predominantly cu 3d and one predominantly o 2p holes , however , having the same @xmath59 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath79 hole competition reflects the subtle balance between the gain in electron - electron repulsion ( u@xmath91v@xmath92 ) and the loss in one - particle energy both affected by a lattice polarization .",

    "_ @xcite and j. tanaka _",
    "et al._@xcite namely these orbitals , as they state , define the low - energy physics of copper oxides .    in connection with the valent @xmath94 manifold model for copper oxides one should note and comment the results of paper by tjeng et al .",
    "@xcite where the authors state that they `` ... are able to unravel the different spin states in the single - particle excitation spectrum of antiferromagnetic cuo and show that the top of the valence band is of pure singlet character , which provides strong support for the existence and stability of zhang - rice singlets in high-@xmath20 cuprates '' . however , in their photoemission work they made use of the cu 2p@xmath95 resonance condition that allows to detect unambiguously only copper photohole states , hence they can not see the purely oxygen photohole @xmath60 states .    interestingly to note , that among three possible states for trapped hole in cuprate : zr singlet @xmath5 , spin singlet @xmath96 , and spin triplet @xmath97 , only the latter provides relevant conditions for the hole transport through antiferromagnetic background .",
    "in other words , one might speak about the spin - triplet channel of @xmath39 hole transport as a main mechanism of conductivity in insulating cuprates.@xcite      unconventional orbital a - e structure of the hole cuo@xmath43 center in eh droplet goes beyond simple zr singlet picture and deserves more close examination . neglecting the spin degree of freedom",
    "we introduce a pseudo - spin formalism to describe the orbital states of the cuo@xmath26 centers in the framework of the valent ( @xmath98 ) multiplet model .",
    "three orbital states of the ( @xmath98 ) multiplet we associate with three states of _ orbital pseudo - spin _ @xmath99 : @xmath100 then the pseudospin matrix has a very simple form : @xmath101 a complete set of the pseudo - spin operators should include both @xmath102 and five spin - quadrupole operators @xmath103 these pseudo - spin operators are not to be confused with real physical spin - operators as they act in a pseudo - space .",
    "nevertheless , all these correspond to real physical quantities .",
    "first , the @xmath104-component of pseudo - spin defines the only non - zero @xmath104-component of the ising - like orbital magnetic moment : @xmath105 , with the only nonzero @xmath106 component of @xmath107 -tensor .",
    "microscopically , the effective magnetic moment is generated by the orbital currents for the @xmath60 hole .",
    "taking into account only local oxygen contributions one may write @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the orbital momentum operator for @xmath111-oxygen .",
    "second , the @xmath112 pseudo - spin components define the unconventional quantity with spatio - transformational properties of polar vector like electric field , and time - inversion symmetry like magnetic field .",
    "this is a so - called toroidal moment which can be defined for the cuo@xmath26 plaquette as follows : @xmath113 $ ] , where the @xmath114-vector has the only non - zero @xmath104-component .",
    "microscopically , the effective toroidal moment can be derived through the local oxygen effective orbital moments as follows : @xmath115\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath116 it should be emphasized that both magnetic and toroidal moment are generated by the orbital currents for the oxygen holes .",
    "the numerical magnitude of the effective orbital magnetic moment in @xmath117 state is determined mainly by the mixing of o 2p@xmath33 and o 2p@xmath70 orbitals ( see exps .",
    "( [ eu ] ) and ( [ tan ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath118 where @xmath119 is a covalency parameter for @xmath120 bond . for a relatively small @xmath121-mixing @xmath122",
    "given the reasonable values @xmath123 ev and @xmath124 ev . for the @xmath114-vector",
    "we readily obtain @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a covalency parameter for @xmath127 bond .",
    "this expression together with ( [ t ] ) implies that the toroidal moment is generated by oxygen orbital moments @xmath128 which value can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath129 given @xmath130 .",
    "it is quite probable that the toroidal fluctuations will be comparable , or even more pronounced than that of conventional magnetic moment .",
    "the toroidal moment is distributed on cuo@xmath26 plaquette and produces a nonzero dipole magnetic field . for all points lying in the cuo@xmath26 plane",
    "the field has @xmath131-axis orientation whereas it has @xmath132-orientation for all points lying in other symmetry planes .",
    "above we estimated the maximal values of magnetic and toroidal moments for the a - e model of cuo@xmath26 center .",
    "puzzlingly , these compete with cu@xmath4 spin magnetic moments in parent oxides , which are markedly reduced by a quantum reduction and covalent effects .",
    "actually , we should deal with the quenching effect of `` single - ion '' anisotropy or other crystalline fields on the orbital magnetism .",
    "the symmetric quadratic pseudo - spin operators define effective electric dipole and quadrupole moments .",
    "the former has a planar character with two non - zero components : @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is effective dipole moment length .",
    "the latter has three non - zero components : @xmath135 with three quadrupole parameters @xmath136 .",
    "thus , the cuo@xmath26 plaquette with ( @xmath137 ) valent multiplet forms an unconventional magneto - electric center characterized by eight independent orbital order parameters . generally speaking , our model represents a theory that predicts broken time - reversal ( @xmath138 ) symmetry , two - dimensional parity ( @xmath139 ) , and basic tetragonal symmetry .",
    "below we address some unconventional properties of @xmath2cu hyperfine interactions for the spin - singlet @xmath140 valence multiplet of the cuo@xmath26 center resulting from its non - quenched orbital moment .",
    "the nuclear resonance experiments right up to now are interpreted within the shastri - mila - rice spin - hamiltonian @xcite @xmath141,\\ ] ] based on the assumption that the spin density in the cuo@xmath26 centers is localized on the copper ions . here",
    "@xmath142 is the hyperfine tensor for the direct , on - site coupling of the @xmath2cu nuclei to the cu@xmath4 spins ( @xmath143 ) , @xmath144 is the strength of the transferred hyperfine coupling of the @xmath2cu nuclear spin to the four nearest neighbor cu@xmath4 spins .",
    "effective hamiltonian of nuclear quadrupole interactions for @xmath145cu nuclei has a conventional form as follows    @xmath146,\\ ] ]    where for cuo@xmath26 center @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the radius - vector of cuo@xmath26 center .",
    "parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 determine the @xmath59 contribution to @xmath152 for @xmath51 and @xmath153 terms , respectively , while @xmath154 does the total contribution of the cu @xmath155 electrons .",
    "the @xmath145cu nqr frequency can be written as follows @xmath156 a variety of the model efg calculations were carried out .",
    "@xcite first , we would like to note the extreme sensitivity of the efg to the calculated anisotropic charge distribution of the semicore cu 3p states which are characterized by the very large magnitude of the effective quadrupole parameter @xmath157 ( ref . ) , or @xmath158 ( ref . ) .",
    "this parameter governs the magnitude both of the efg tensor and local magnetic field induced by cu 3p electron on copper nucleus : @xmath159 @xmath160 where @xmath161 is an orbital momentum for cu 3p electron , and @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the cu 3p contribution to the efg and to the local field can reach colossal values such as 100 ( in @xmath163 vm@xmath164 ) and @xmath165 @xmath166 , respectively . in conventional cuprate scenarios with valence @xmath0 holes",
    "there is no hybridization between cu 3p and valence states , and the semicore cu 3p contribution to electric and magnetic hyperfine interactions can be taken into account in frames of sternheimer shielding - antishielding effects .",
    "however , the semicore cu 3p role becomes of particular significance for the @xmath98 valence multiplet of electron and hole centers with varying hole density in oxygen @xmath60 states which have the same symmetry as cu 3p@xmath167 states , that is these can hybridize with each other . as a result , the purely oxygen @xmath60 orbital turns into o 2p - cu 3p hybrid molecular orbital ( mo ) @xmath168 with mo coefficients @xmath169 .",
    "thus we arrive at the effective magnetic and electric `` oxygen - to - copper '' transferred orbital hyperfine interaction .",
    "the effective @xmath39 contribution to the local field on the copper nucleus can be written in terms of pseudo - spin formalism as ( in tesla ) @xmath170 @xmath171 irrespective of the magnitude of the orbital moment for cuo@xmath26 center .",
    "for the nonzero efg components @xmath172 we obtain ( in @xmath163 vm@xmath164 ) @xmath173 @xmath174 interestingly , that eqs.([h ] ) and ( [ v ] ) imply that the ratio between local field and efg is governed only by the ratio between respective pseudo - spin averages : @xmath175 simple relation between local field and efg governed only by the respective pseudo - spin averages implies a rather subtle interplay between magnetic and electric contributions both to nmr - nqr frequencies and the spin - lattice relaxation rate for copper nuclei .",
    "the numerical calculations allow us to expect the o 2p - cu 3p mixing coefficient @xmath176 to be of the order of several hundredth . indeed , the overlap contribution to this coefficient given the cu - o separations @xmath177 is estimated @xcite to be @xmath178 for the strongest cu 3p - o 2p @xmath70-bonding and @xmath179 .",
    "in such a way the oxygen @xmath39 hole contribution to the orbital hyperfine interactions due to the cu 3p@xmath33-o 2p@xmath33 overlap can be estimated as @xmath180 tesla and @xmath181 vm@xmath164 for magnetic and electric terms , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the respective maximal values correspond to the very large magnitude of effective nmr and nqr frequencies of the order of 10 mhz .",
    "moreover , the oxygen @xmath61 hole contribution can be approximately four times bigger .",
    "we showed that outgoing beyond a simple zr model we arrive at a complex @xmath94 structure of the valent multiplet for the hole cuo@xmath182 center in cuprate with engaging orbital degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , it should be emphasized that simple @xmath140 model implies a spinless purely orbital and purely oxygen scenario of magnetic response and hyperfine interactions in doped cuprates .",
    "however , we do not completely reject the spin degree of freedom . indeed",
    ", our model implies a near degeneracy for singlet @xmath96 and triplet @xmath97 terms with many interesting manifestations of the spin singlet - triplet magnetism.@xcite moreover , both spin and orbital degrees of freedom are likely to be involved into a formation of the complex magnetic response of doped cuprates with a relative weight that manifests itself diversely depending on the energy range and experimental conditions ( nmr - nqr , magnetic susceptibility , magnetic neutron scattering , ... ) .",
