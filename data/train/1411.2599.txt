    "in the standard picture of galaxy structure , disk galaxies have two main stellar components .",
    "the defining component is the disk : a highly flattened structure dominated by rotation , often ( but not always ) with a radial density profile which is exponential ; disks often have significant substructure , particularly bars and spiral arms .",
    "the secondary component , present in early and intermediate hubble types , is the bulge .",
    "traditionally , the bulge has been seen as something very like a small elliptical galaxy embedded within the disk : more spheroidal than the disk , with stellar motions dominated by velocity dispersion rather than rotation , and having a strongly concentrated structure ",
    "e.g. , having a surface brightness profile similar or identical to the stereotypical @xmath9 profile of an elliptical ) .",
    "in addition , the stellar populations of bulges were said to resemble those of ellipticals in being older ( and possibly more metal - rich and alpha - enhanced ) than the majority of stars in the disk .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for reviews . ) taken all together , this seemed to argue for a bulge formation mechanism similar to that proposed for ellipticals , either via monolithic collapse or by rapid , violent mergers of initial subcomponents at high redshift .",
    "the past decade or two has seen the growing realization that this picture is probably _ not _ true for many bulges , at least when bulges are defined as the excess stellar light in the central regions of the galaxy when compared to the dominant exponential profile of the disk .",
    "instead , bulges are now seen as falling into two rather different classes : classical bulges ( the traditional model ) and _ pseudobulges _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which are conceived of as something much more like disks than spheroids ; i.e. , they are flattened and dominated by rotation , with profiles which are close to exponential .",
    "added to this complexity is the existence of so - called `` boxy '' and `` peanut - shaped '' bulges , which are now well understood as the vertically thickened inner parts of bars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the distinctions ) ; confusingly , these structures are also sometimes called pseudobulges .",
    "although some authors are careful to point out the possibility that classical bulges could coexist with pseudobulges ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is common to suggest that galaxies have one or the other , but not both .",
    "for example , in observational surveys such as those of @xcite or @xcite , photometrically identified bulges are classified as either classical or pseudobulge .",
    "similarly , in studies of how central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) relate to their host galaxies , disk galaxies are divided into those with classical bulges and those with pseudobulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present evidence for the _ coexistence _ in nine galaxies of both a classical bulge  that is , a round , kinematically hot stellar structure which is significantly larger than a nuclear star cluster  and a disky pseudobulge  that is , a flattened stellar system , distinct from the main disk , whose kinematics are at least partly dominated by rotation and which ( usually ) hosts nuclear bars , nuclear rings , or other disky morphology .",
    "two of the galaxies discussed here ",
    "ngc  3368 and ngc  3489  were previously discussed , in an abbreviated fashion , in @xcite , using the term `` composite pseudobulges '' .",
    "some analysis of the morphological substructure in ngc  3945 and ngc  4371 has been previously presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "after some initial discussion of data sources and reduction ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) , we lay out our terminology in section  [ sec : terms ] .",
    "we introduce our methodology for identifying classical bulges by considering in section  [ sec : simple - classical ] two examples of _ simple _ classical - bulge - plus - disk systems ( galaxies with _ only _ a classical bulge in addition to their disk ) .",
    "with this as a reference , we then consider two galaxies ( ngc  3945 and ngc  4371 ) in some detail in section  [ sec : n3945n4371 ] , demonstrating first that much of their photometrically defined bulges are _ not _ classical bulges as previously defined , but something else : ( disky ) pseudobulges .",
    "we then go on to show that inside each pseudobulge is an additional structure which _ does _ resemble a classical bulge .",
    "the evidence for composite bulges in seven other galaxies follows a similar pattern , but is postponed to the appendix ( section  [ sec : others - full ] ) so as not to interrupt the flow of the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : dynamics ] uses the results of schwarzschild modeling for three composite - bulge galaxies to investigate the 3d stellar dynamics of the classical - bulge and disky - pseudobulge components .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] considers these composite - bulge galaxies and their subcomponents , including an analysis of their place in the mass - radius and surface - density  mass diagrams and a demonstration that the classical - bulge components , while generally rather small , are not in the same class as nuclear star clusters .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes our findings .",
    "imaging data for this study comes from a variety of sources ; for each galaxy , we specify the individual images used and their origins . some of the large - scale , ground - based optical images come from the wiyn survey @xcite , the int - wfc observations of @xcite , or from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; for the latter , we use data release 7 ( dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "other ground - based image sources include wht - ingrid @xmath10-band images from @xcite , available via ned , and images from the european southern observatory ( eso ) archive and the isaac newton group ( ing ) archive .    for high - resolution imaging of the central regions of galaxies ,",
    "we rely on archival images from the _ hubble space telescope _ , obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs - wfc ) , or the nicmos2 and nicmos3 near - ir imagers . in some cases",
    " i.e. , when _ hst _ imaging data is lacking or when the centre of a galaxy is particularly dusty  we use adaptive - optics @xmath10-band images derived from our vlt - sinfoni ifu observations by collapsing the datacubes along the wavelength direction .",
    "the latter observations are described in more detail in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the surface - brightness profiles we construct and analyze combine data from multiple images for each galaxy : high - resolution data from _ hst _ or ao imaging for the smallest radii , where good spatial resolution is critical , and non - ao ground - based imaging for larger radii , since the galaxies extend beyond the high - resolution imaging fields of view . to combine these data",
    ", we must match the overall intensity scaling , and we must also account for the fact that the high - resolution images are too small for accurate background subtraction .",
    "( the vlt - sinfoni ao observations were taken with offsets to blank sky , but these were spaced too far apart in time for accurate removal of the overall background levels . )",
    "the problem is then to find the correct multiplicative scaling @xmath11 to match the background - corrected `` inner '' profile ( from the high - resolution image ) with the `` outer '' profile ( from the low - resolution image , which is large enough for its own background to be properly estimated ) , while also determining the unknown background level @xmath12 in the high - resolution image , so that we can transform the observed inner profile @xmath13 to a corrected profile @xmath14 : @xmath15    fortunately , these two issues can be dealt with in combination , by taking advantage of the fact that the same galaxy was observed in both images .",
    "the trick is to identify a radial overlap zone between the two profiles ( outside the region where seeing distorts the low - resolution data ) and iteratively fit for the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 which minimize the difference @xmath16 for values of @xmath17 in the overlap zone ( with @xmath18 being the outer profile ) .",
    "the two profiles are then merged at the best - matching radius in the overlap region .",
    "although the profiles we analyze are usually major - axis cuts , in practice we determine @xmath11 and @xmath12 using profiles from ellipse fits with fixed position angle and ellipticity , to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this approach is ideal when the high- and low - resolution images were taken with the same filter ; in some cases , we are forced to match and combine profiles from images with dissimilar filters ( e.g. , f814w and @xmath19 , or @xmath10 and @xmath20 ) .    when decomposing our surface - brightness profiles",
    " which are typically cuts along the major axis of the galaxy  we do not attempt to correct for psf convolution , though we do exclude the inner 23 pixels of the profile from the fit . for several galaxies with _ hst _ images",
    ", we estimated the possible effects of neglecting psf convolution by also extracting profiles from images which had been deconvolved using the lucy - richardson algorithm ( via the iraf task ` lucy ` ) and tinytim - generated psfs .",
    "( this was not possible for all galaxies , since for some galaxies we rely on sinfoni data for which psfs can not be determined with nearly the same precision . )",
    "comparison of fits to both uncorrected and `` deconvolved '' profiles of the same galaxy showed that parameters for the central ( classical ) bulges differ by @xmath21% in the srsic index @xmath22 and @xmath23% for other parameters .",
    "some of the spectroscopic data used for ngc  2859 and ngc  4371 is based on previously unpublished data obtained with the isis double spectrograph on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "details of the observations are provided in the appendix ( section  [ sec : data - spec ] ) .    for ngc  3368 ,",
    "ngc  3945 and ngc  4371 we use long - slit data obtained with the marcario low resolution spectrograph at the hobby - eberly telescope , previously presented in @xcite . for ngc  3368 and ngc  4699",
    ", we also use ifu data from our sinfoni @xmath10-band smbh measurement program @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "we also make use of various published long - slit and ifu kinematic data ; the specific sources are listed in the discussions of each galaxy .",
    "we note here some datasets provided directly to us . for ngc  1068 , this includes both long - slit data from @xcite , provided by joris gerssen , and sinfoni data for ngc  1068 @xcite , provided by ric davies .",
    "large - scale sinfoni kinematic data for ngc  3368 @xcite were provided by erin hicks .",
    "finally , for ngc  4262 we make use of oasis ifu data @xcite , provided by richard mcdermid .",
    "the terms `` pseudobulge '' and `` classical bulge '' are unfortunately rather ambiguous at present .",
    "sometimes they are defined in terms of their presumed formation methods : e.g. , pseudobulges are central concentrations of stars formed from bar- or spiral - driven inflows of gas in the disk plane , or even by any process that does not explicitly involve major mergers , while classical bulges are those structures formed by violent relaxation in major mergers ( usually at high redshifts ) .",
    "the fundamental problem with such approaches is that there are few if any clear observational predictions for how to distinguish such formation methods in nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , the formation of central `` bulges '' by the merger of massive star - forming clumps in gas - rich , high-@xmath20 disks can produce thick , dispersion - dominated central structures with @xmath24 light profiles and @xmath25-enhanced metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , fulfilling most of the traditional criteria for classical bulges . if one insists on major mergers as the formation mechanism , then these are not classical bulges  but we would have little or no way to distinguish these structures at @xmath26 from `` proper '' classical bulges .",
    "other theoretical studies of this formation mechanism argue that the resulting bulges should be smaller and more exponential - like , with srsic indices of @xmath27 or even @xmath28 , and significant rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what this means is that a classification of structures in present - day galaxies based on their supposed formation mechanisms , though desirable , is probably still premature .",
    "if we turn to the more feasible approach of observationally - based classification , we still find considerable discord , if not an outright cacophony .",
    "some surveys classify the central region of a galaxy as classical or pseudobulge depending on the presence or absence of certain morphological features : e.g. , a smooth light distribution means a classical bulge , while the presence of dust lanes , spiral arms , rings , nuclear - scale bars , or so - called boxy / peanut - shaped isophotes means a pseudobulge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "other studies make distinctions based on photometric profiles of the `` bulge '' component that results from a bulge - disk decomposition ",
    "e.g. , pseudobulges are by definition any central structure with a srsic index @xmath29 , or even any such structure with @xmath30 @xcite  or some combination of mean surface brightness and size for the bulge component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of this confusion , we feel it is important to be clear about our terminology and our methods for identifying and classifying different types of `` bulges '' . as part of our analysis",
    ", we first identify what we call * photometric bulges*. this term refers to the region of a galaxy where the observed stellar surface brightness is brighter than an inward extrapolation of the outer disk component , or is brighter than the inward extrapolation of a previously identified disky pseudobulge .",
    "we require that the photometric bulge should be more extended than a simple nuclear star cluster ( i.e. , the half - light radius should be @xmath31 pc ) .",
    "this is , as the name suggests , a purely photometric classification , and is used only as a preliminary tool ( and for comparison with the results of purely photometric methodologies ) .",
    "we then analyse the photometric bulges and classify them into two categories :    * * classical bulge : * this is a photometric bulge which is some type of kinematically hot spheroid .",
    "that is , it must be clearly _ rounder _ in a three - dimensional sense than the main galaxy disk ( i.e. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the vertical scale length and @xmath34 is the radial ) _ and _ must have stellar kinematics which are dominated by velocity dispersion rather than rotation .",
    "* * disky pseudobulge : * this is a photometric bulge which is `` disklike '' in _ two _ main ways : it has a flattening similar or identical to that of the main galaxy disk , and the stellar kinematics are dominated by rotation rather than velocity dispersion at least some point within the photometric bulge region .",
    "we also consider the presence of clear morphological features such as bars , rings and spiral arms to be additional signatures of a disky pseudobulge , but do not rely on them alone .",
    "it is important to note that our definition of classical bulge does _ not _ assume a particular surface - brightness profile shape : we are not assuming that kinematically hot spheroids must have de vaucouleurs @xmath9 profiles , nor that they must have srsic indices greater than some minimum value .",
    "we also note that we are not considering several characteristics which are sometimes , as alluded to previously , discussed as indicative of `` pseudobulges '' @xcite . for example , we are mostly not concerned with the presence or absence of dust in the centres of these galaxies , since this can sometimes be due to off - plane or counter - rotating gas ( likely the result of accretion ) , and in other cases may merely indicate that the disk and bulge are co - extensive .",
    "since many of the galaxies we consider are lenticular , we do not require the presence of current or recent star formation as a pseudobulge indicator either .",
    "thus , we are explicitly including what @xcite called `` inactive pseudobulges '' ( objects in their sample which had what they considered the morphological and photometric signatures of pseudobulges but which showed little or no evidence for recent star formation ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we are , for the most part , explicitly excluding boxy / peanut - shaped bulges from consideration in this study . as @xcite pointed out , these are the vertically thickened inner parts of bars , the result of a common dynamical instability which appears to accompany the formation of most bars .",
    "as such , they are _ not _ the sort of highly flattened , axisymmetric structures we are most interested in .",
    "none the less , we _ do _ consider the question of their possible co - existence with disky pseudobulges and classical bulges later on in the paper ( section  [ sec : boxy ] ) .    in section  [ sec : simple - classical ]",
    ", we present two cases of s0 galaxies with purely classical bulges , as a way of providing both examples of how we identify classical bulges and some context for the composite bulges we discuss later . in section  [ sec : n3945n4371 ] we then go on to analyze two composite - bulge s0 galaxies in detail ; we start by identifying disky pseudobulges in each galaxy . while we would ideally like to present an example or two of `` pure disky pseudobulge '' systems before moving on to the composite bulges , we have encountered difficulty in trying to identify any clear examples in the very nearby ( e.g. , @xmath35 mpc ) , early - type disk galaxy population for which the necessary data ( particularly stellar kinematics with the right combination of high spatial resolution and radial extent ) exist .",
    "the problem is not so much identifying candidate disky pseudobulges in other nearby galaxies ( as numerous others have done ) , but rather being able to clearly demonstrate that these are _ not also _ composite bulge galaxies : i.e. , that there are no classical bulges , however small , inside these galaxies .",
    "the fact that we do not present any examples of s0sb disk galaxies with pure disky pseudobulges should not , however , be taken as a claim that such systems are absent in the local universe .",
    "how does one identify the `` bulge '' of a galaxy , and how does one determine whether such a structure is more like a classical bulge or a disky pseudobulge ?",
    "our basic approach has three steps .",
    "first , we identify the photometric bulge via a standard srsic + exponential decomposition of the entire galaxy .",
    "the outer boundary of the ( photometric ) `` bulge - dominated '' region is then identified by finding the radius @xmath36 where the srsic and exponential components are equal in brightness : @xmath37 note that this radius may vary somewhat depending on the wavelengths of the data being used for the fit .",
    "second , we analyse the morphology of the photometric bulge region , focusing especially on the shape of the isophotes .",
    "our working assumption is that the photometric bulge and the outer disk share a common equatorial plane ( i.e. , they have the same line of nodes and , most importantly , the same inclination to the line of sight ) .",
    "this means that if the bulge is intrinsically rounder ( more spheroidal ) than the disk , its projected isophotes should appear rounder than those of the outer disk ; in the extreme case of a spherical bulge , we would expect to see the elliptical isophotes of the ( projected ) outer disk give way to circular isophotes at small radii , where the bulge dominates the light .    finally , we analyse the stellar kinematics in the photometric bulge region , trying to determine whether they are more dominated by rotation or velocity dispersion . traditionally , one way of using stellar kinematics to discriminate between classical bulges and pseudobulges ( going back to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been to note the position of the bulge in question on the @xmath38@xmath39 diagram @xcite , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the `` characteristic '' stellar velocity and velocity dispersion and @xmath39 is the ellipticity .",
    "is usually taken to be the maximum stellar rotation velocity @xmath42 and @xmath41 is some `` central '' value ; the ellipticity is sometimes the maximum observed value and sometimes a mean value . ] one can define a curve in this diagram which corresponds to an `` isotropic oblate rotator '' ( ior ) , a simple model for a classical bulge or elliptical with isotropic velocity dispersion and possible flattening due to modest amounts of stellar rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the object clearly lies above the ior curve , then the argument is that the object is too dominated by rotation to be considered a classical bulge .",
    "( kinematically hot systems with little or no rotation but significant anisotropy will tend to lie below the ior line . )",
    "this is one of the methods by which some of the original `` pseudobulges '' ( avant la lettre ) were identified @xcite .",
    "recent discussion of this diagram , primarily in the context of elliptical and s0 galaxies and taking advantage of 2d kinematics , include , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some problems with the @xmath38@xmath39 approach . the underlying theoretical arguments for the reference ior models presuppose simple , coherent stellar systems with unique , unambiguous values for the ellipticity , velocity and velocity dispersion .",
    "the original application envisaged was elliptical galaxies , where at least the domain ( the entire galaxy ) is unambiguous .",
    "but in the case of complex systems such as a bulge embedded within a disk containing secondary structures ( nuclear rings , bars , etc . ) , it is not at all clear how one is supposed to define `` the '' ellipticity ; nor is it clear how to define `` the '' velocity dispersion when the latter can vary significantly with radius .",
    "even the common technique of choosing the _ maximum _ stellar velocity as `` the '' velocity runs into trouble if the rotation curve continues to rise throughout the bulge region and on into the disk - dominated part of the galaxy ( or if the rotation curve has multiple peaks ) .    faced with these difficulties ,",
    "we opt for a different approach : we define a simple _ local _ measurement of the relative importance of rotation versus disperson , by deprojecting the observed rotation to its in - plane value @xmath43 and then dividing this by the observed velocity dispersion @xmath41 _ at the same radius_. the resulting quantity ",
    "@xmath44  is a continually varying function of the radius , not a `` universal '' value for an entire galaxy ( or entire galactic component ) .",
    "we adopt an admittedly crude and ad - hoc limit of @xmath45 as the dividing line between kinematically `` cool '' and kinematically `` hot '' systems , so that classical bulges should have @xmath46 within the region where they dominate the galaxy s light . in the following subsections",
    "we provide some partial justification for this criterion by showing that galaxies with simple disk + spheroidal bulge morphologies do seem to have @xmath46 within their bulge - dominated regions .",
    "since we identify the photometric bulge region via decomposition of the major - axis profile , it makes sense to use major - axis value of @xmath44 .",
    "this lets us use major - axis long - slit spectroscopy , which is in many cases the only available stellar kinematic data  or the only data covering the full radial range of interest  for the galaxies we examine .    to show how this approach works in the simple case of disk galaxies _ without _ pseudobulges , the following subsections apply our methodology to two s0s with classical bulges .",
    "ngc  7457 is a nearby ( @xmath47  mpc ) low - luminosity s0 galaxy , seen at moderate inclination ( @xmath48 ; @xcite ) ; it has a central velocity dispersion of only @xmath4970 km  s@xmath50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although it has been suggested as a possible pseudobulge host in the past , largely on the basis of supposed deviations from the faber - jackson relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the ellipticity stays roughly constant in to @xmath55 arcsec , and then becomes progressively rounder inside .",
    "this is consistent with the influence of a round bulge embedded within a highly elliptical ( inclined ) disk , so we have evidence that the photometric bulge identified in the b / d decomposition is a rounder ( and thus more spheroidal ) object than the disk .",

    "of particular note is the fact that their 2d decomposition had a best fit using a srsic bulge component with ellipticity @xmath67 , in contrast to the best - fitting exponential disk ellipticity of 0.73 .",
    "this is clear support for the idea that the photometric bulge corresponds to a region which is significantly rounder than the disk .",
    "the slight twisting and rounding of isophotes between @xmath68 and 40 arcsec may indicate a very weak bar or lens , but otherwise this galaxy is very close to an ideal exponential disk + srsic bulge system .",
