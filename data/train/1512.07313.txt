    "ever since the foundations of quantum mechanics , time has been mostly considered as an external classical parameter . various attempts to incorporate time in a fully quantum framework",
    "have nonetheless been made , starting with the page and wootters mechanism @xcite and other subsequent proposals @xcite .",
    "this subject has recently received increasing attention in both quantum mechanics @xcite and general relativity @xcite , where this problem is considered a key issue in the connection between both theories . in the present work",
    "we introduce a simple discrete quantum model of evolution , which on one hand , constitutes a consistent discrete version of the formalism of @xcite , while on the other hand , provides a practical means to simulate quantum evolutions .",
    "we show that a quantum circuit for the model can be constructed , which in the case of a constant hamiltonian is able to simulate the evolution over @xmath2 times in terms of just @xmath1 time - qubits and @xmath3 gates , providing the basis for a parallel - in - time simulation .",
    "we then introduce and discuss the concept of system - time entanglement , which arises naturally in the present scenario , as a quantifier of the actual distinguishable evolution undergone by the system .",
    "such quantifier can be related to the minimum time necessarily elapsed by the system . for a constant hamiltonian",
    "we show that this entanglement is bounded above by the entropy associated with the spread over energy eigenstates of the initial state , reaching this bound for a spectrum leading to a cyclic evolution , in which case it satisfies an entropic energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "illustrative analytical results for a qubit - clock , which constitutes the basic building block in the present setting , are provided .",
    "the continuous limit for the evolution between two arbitrary states is also analyzed .",
    "we consider a bipartite system @xmath4 , where @xmath5 represents a quantum system and @xmath6 a quantum clock system with finite hilbert space dimension @xmath7 .",
    "the whole system is assumed to be in a pure state of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath6 and @xmath10 arbitrary pure states of @xmath5 .",
    "such state can describe , for instance , the whole evolution of an initial pure state @xmath11 of @xmath5 at a discrete set of times @xmath12 .",
    "the state @xmath13 at time @xmath12 can be recovered as the conditional state of @xmath5 after a local measurement at @xmath6 in the previous basis with result @xmath12 : @xmath14 } { \\langle\\psi|\\pi_t|\\psi\\rangle}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 . in shorthand notation @xmath16 .",
