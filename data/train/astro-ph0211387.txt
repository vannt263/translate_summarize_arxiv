    "recently , we completed a search for molecular absorption towards 11 dlas at @xmath9 mm with the sest 15-m and onsala 20-m telescopes which , apart from one tentative detection , only lead to upper limits for 18 transitions @xcite . with the upgraded atca it is now possible to improve on these previous attempts . in this paper",

    "observations towards the known southern centimetre - loud quasars occulted by dlas in which a commonly detected transition falls into the 12 mm band .",
    "the observations were performed in june 2002 with the atca at narrabri , australia during excellent weather conditions which gave good phase stability .",
    "the telescope has recently been upgraded with the addition of 12 mm and 3 mm receivers to antennae 2 , 3 and 4 ( see * ? ? ? * ) , thus permitting the search for redshifted molecular rotational lines with this instrument . as mentioned above",

    "the measured 22 ghz flux density of @xmath12 jy now joins @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 jy for the measured radio flux densities of 0336017 @xcite .",

    "ideally we would have selected the most visually faint ( and hence dusty ) objects . however , the atca still has a relatively narrow tuning range in the 12 mm band .",
    "we therefore selected all of the `` high flux '' dlas which can be observed with this restriction ( see table [ t1 ] ) .",

    "therefore our results are of little use in assigning upper limits to the molecular hydrogen column density , @xmath26 . in order to bypass this uncertainty",

    "the ultra - violet h@xmath5 lines are redshifted to optical wavelengths and indeed h@xmath5 has been found in absorption in 7 dlas at @xmath39 ratios of @xmath40% @xcite . in the low metallicity environments typical of dlas ( [ zn / h ]  @xmath41 to @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 0.01 to 0.1 solar , e.g. @xcite ) , @xcite argues that even if the gas is cool , the ambient ionization is sufficient to suppress the formation of h@xmath5 . this may offer a potential explanation for our non - detections .",
    "the under - abundance of heavier elements introduces another uncertainty : the application of galactic co - to - h@xmath5 conversion ratios .",

    "x molecular bands , @xcite find @xmath44 in dlas , which is indeed only 10% of the local ratio .",
    "in addition , at earlier epochs of chemical enrichment we would expect that there is simply a lack of raw materials to form significant amounts of tracer molecules ( e.g. co , hco@xmath2 , hcn and cs ) even in cold dark clouds where h@xmath5 readily forms .",
    "a reliable conversion ratio could be obtained by searching for co absorption towards the dlas in which h@xmath5 has been detected .",
    "however , the detection of h@xmath5 biases towards optically bright sources and hence an under - abundance of dust . furthermore , none of the quasars illuminating the 7 known h@xmath5 absorbing dlas have appreciable 12 or 3 mm fluxes ( curran et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    in summary , not only",
    "do the low metallicities reduce the molecular hydrogen content in dlas , but they may also further lower the column densities of other molecular tracers , making the detection of these much more difficult than expected .",
    "it is clear that further statistics are required in order to identify the factors most crucial ( e.g. column density , visual magnitude or metallicity ) in determining the molecular content of dlas .",
    "it would be of interest to compare the metallicities of the four known molecular absorbers , especially in the highest redshift case ( @xmath45 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these lie along the lines - of - sight to quasars which , although bright in the millimetre regime , are too optically dim ( v@xmath46 in all cases ) to estimate the metal - to - hydrogen ratio .",
