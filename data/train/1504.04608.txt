    "the phase behavior of systems as particles interacting via the so - called core - softened ( cs ) potentials has received a lot of attention recently .",
    "they show a repulsive core with a softening region when particles are very close and an attractive region when particles are more distant .",
    "these cs can be modeled as continuous potentials or lattice gas models . for the lattice structure",
    "the two competing scales arise from two equilibrium configurations : low density and high density .",
    "this procedure generates models that are analytically and computationally tractable and that one hopes are capable of retaining the qualitative features of the real complex systems .",
    "the physical motivation behind these studies is the assumption that two length scales systems exhibit the same anomalous behaviors present in water .    confirming this hypothesis a number of continuous  @xcite and lattice gas models  @xcite show the presence of density , diffusion and structural anomalous behavior as observed in water  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the seventy - two anomalies  @xcite , water has at very low temperatures two coexisting amorphous phases with distinct densities : the low density amorphous ( lda ) and high density amorphous phases ( hda ) @xcite .",
    "these two amorphous phases led to the hypothesis of the existence at higher temperatures of two liquid phases : a low density liquid and high density liquid phases .",
    "such conjecture establishes that the coexistence between these two liquid phases ends in a second critical point or also called , liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp )  @xcite .",
    "experiments for testing the existence of this criticality are difficult since the region in the pressure versus temperature phase diagram where the alleged critical point exists is locate beyond the homogeneous nucleation limit . in order to circumvent this difficulty for testing the existence of the liquid - liquid critical point recently confined geometries",
    "have been employed  @xcite . in these nanoconfined geometries",
    "the disruption of the hydrogen bonds suppress the solidification of the system and allows for maintaining the system liquid in temperatures in which otherwise would be solid  @xcite .",
    "these experimental systems show convincing evidences that water exhibits two liquid structures at low temperatures .",
    "the use of confining water , however brings another set of issues .",
    "what guarantees that the same thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies and criticality present in the bulk are not destroyed as the system is confined ? can confinement bring up new phenomena not present in the bulk system ? in order to answer these questions water - like atomistic or continuous effective potential models were explored confined by different geometries such as plates @xcite , one pore @xcite and disordered matrix @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that confinement leads to a controversial result regarding the melting line .",
    "while results for spc / e water show that the melting temperature for hydrophobic plates is lower than the bulk and higher than for hydrophilic walls , for mw model no difference between the melting temperature due to the hydrophobicity  @xcite is found .    in confined systems",
    "the tmd occurs at lower temperatures for hydrophobic confinement  @xcite and at higher temperatures for hydrophilic confinement  @xcite when compared with the bulk .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 , in the direction parallel to the plates exhibit an anomalous behavior as observed in bulk water .",
    "however the temperatures of the maximum and minimum of @xmath0 are lower than in bulk water  @xcite . in the direction perpendicular to the plates ,",
    "no diffusion anomalous behavior is observed  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual density and diffusion anomalous behavior , these confined systems show a variety of new effects not present in the bulk .",
    "for example , fluids confined in carbon nanotube exhibit formation of layers , crystallization of the contact layer @xcite and a superflow not present in macroscopic confinement @xcite .",
    "the confinement by a pore , within plates or nanotubes is symmetric and even though it introduces a breaking of the water hydrogen bond network , this is done in an ordered way .",
    "confining matrix such as the ones present in plants and underground water are not ordered .",
    "recently the effects of an water - like liquid confined in a disordered matrix have been analyzed using a model in which the bonds are introduced by the inclusion of potts variables  @xcite .",
    "this study shows that the liquid - liquid coexistence line is affected by the increase of the density of random porous in the matrix without disappearing .",
    "in all these studies , however the liquid - liquid transition is preserved and the density of confining matrix is not very high . here , we give a further step by investigating effects imposed by disordered porous when the random matrix exhibits a high density .",
    "the system is defined in a triangular lattice where the obstacles are fixed and randomly distributed .",
    "the fluid is modeled as a associating lattice gas model  @xcite defined an occupational variable together with a bond orientational variable .",
    "this model in the bulk shows the density and diffusion anomalies present in water and the liquid - gas and liquid - liquid criticality  @xcite . here",

    "the above changes in liquid phases as well as transition points can be understood by verifying that the inclusion of porous suppress partially the structured patterns found in the ldl and hdl phases ( see e.g fig .",

    "similar effect is verified in the hdl phase , but the effect is more pronounced in such case .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that in contrast to the hdl phase , porous occupy partially empty sites with neighboring molecules not forming hydrogen bonds in the ldl phase .",
    "this lost of connectivity also explains , in similarity with the decrease of tricritical points , why the transition from the disordered structure to the ldl through the @xmath31-line occurs for lower temperatures than the bulk . recalling that such transition is characterized by the disordered phase ordering by making one of the sublattices empty",
