    "the dimer - atom scattering process was first solved by skorniakov and ter - martirosian in 1956  @xcite , in the context of three - nucleon scattering , i.e. a two - body bound state between a neutron and a proton ( called a deuteron ) is scattering with a neutron .",
    "they considered equal - mass particles , and found that while the born approximation gives @xmath2 for the scattering length between an ab dimer and an a atom , where @xmath3 is the two - body scattering length between a and b particles , the exact result turns out to be @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this problem has recently been analyzed with the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach  @xcite , in the context of cold quantum gases ( see also  @xcite in a different context ) , and the result is in perfect agreement with the earlier results . in the same context , the three - body scattering problem has also been generalized to unequal - mass particles , and analyzed both in real space through solving the three - body schrdinger equation  @xcite and in momentum space through the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach  @xcite , with perfect agreement in between for all mass ratios .",
    "when the mass ratio of the heavy particles to the light one is below @xmath5 , it is also well - established that the three - body scattering problem is universal , and that the dimer - atom scattering length is proportional to the two - body scattering length @xmath3 ( just like the equal mass case ) with the proportionality factor depending only on the masses of the constituent particles  @xcite . however , since three - body efimov bound states emerges for larger mass ratios  @xcite , this problem is not universal , and an additional parameter coming from the short - range ( or large - momentum ) three - body physics is needed for an accurate description .    here",
    ", we use the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach to analyze the three - body scattering problem between two identical fermions and a third particle .",
    "our results are relevant to the quantum phases of two - species fermi - fermi  @xcite . and",
    "bose - fermi  @xcite mixtures of atomic gases in the molecular limit .",
    "the remaining paper is organized as follows . after deriving the skorniakov and ter - martirosian integral equation generalized for unequal - mass particles in sec .",

    "in this paper , we are interested in the three - body ( dimer - atom ) s - wave scattering between two identical fermions ( refer to it as a - type particles ) and a third particle ( refer to it as a b - type particle which could be a different species of fermion or a boson ) . in particular , we consider a zero - ranged attractive interaction between a and b particles , and assume there is a weakly bound resonance between them with the binding energy @xmath6 , so that we want to study the scattering between this bound state ( refer to it as an ab dimer ) and the remaining a atom .",
    "detailed description of the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach for the dimer - atom scattering process can be found in the literature for equal - mass particles  @xcite , and here we give details of our calculation  @xcite for the case of unequal - mass particles .",
    "[ htb ]    we begin our analysis by describing the zero temperature diagrammatic representation for the dimer - atom scattering @xmath0-matrix @xmath7 as illustrated in fig .  [ fig : t - matrix ] , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the incoming and outgoing momenta , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the frequencies for the incoming a particle and ab dimer , respectively .",
    "here , we set the center - of - mass momentum of the dimer - atom system to zero , and @xmath12 is the total frequency where @xmath13 is the binding energy of the two - body bound state between a and b particles , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are masses of the ab dimer and twice the reduced mass of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - matrix ] , single lines represent retarded free propagators for the a and b particles @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy , and @xmath20 is the chemical potential of the corresponding particle . similarly , double lines represent the retarded propagator for the ab dimer , and in three dimensions it can be approximated by a simple one - pole structure @xmath21^{1/2}},\\ ] ] which reflects the presence of a two - body bound state between a and b particles .",
    "this dimer propagator is obtained from the resummation of the ab polarization bubbles leading to @xmath22 , $ ] where @xmath23 is the strength of the bare interaction between a and b particles , and the ab polarization bubble is @xmath24 at zero temperature , @xmath25 in three dimensions .",
    "integration over the internal momentum @xmath26 and frequency @xmath27 leads to @xmath28 which in combination with the definition of the two - body scattering length @xmath29 , and the two - body scattering @xmath0-matrix @xmath30 , $ ] between a and b particles , give the final result described in eq .  ( [ eqn : dimer - propagator ] ) .    in the following , we set @xmath31 since we are interested in the dimer - atom scattering in vacuum",
    "however , note that our diagrammatic calculation for the scattering parameters of the three - body problem is exact , and they are sufficient to describe ultracold quantum gases , since experiments are always performed at low densities .",
    "the calculation of scattering parameters in the presence of many other particles ( arbitrary density ) is much more difficult , and it is not discussed here . in addition , on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - matrix ] , note that the first diagram represents a fermion exchange process , i.e. first the particle b breaks up with the particle a and then it forms a new ab dimer with the remaining a particle .",
    "this is the simplest process contributing to the dimer - atom scattering , e.g. born approximation , and all other ( infinitely many ) possible processes are included in the second diagram .    in analytical form ,",
    "the dimer - atom @xmath0-matrix @xmath7 satisfies the following integral equation @xmath32 the minus signs on the right hand side is due to fermi - dirac statistics , i.e. exchanging a fermion brings a minus sign unlike that of a boson .",
    "the integration over frequency @xmath27 can be easily performed by closing the integration contour in the upper half - plane , where both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are analytic functions of @xmath27 , and only a simple pole contribution comes from @xmath35 .",
    "note that this property of @xmath33 is due to the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t - matrix ] ) itself .",
    "this integration sets @xmath36 , and we set @xmath37 in order to have the same frequency dependence for the @xmath0-matrix on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t - matrix ] ) .",
    "this leads to    @xmath38},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we redefine the @xmath0-matrix @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the total energy and @xmath41 is twice the reduced mass of an ab dimer and an a particle .",
    "since we are interested in the zero - ranged low - energy s - wave scattering , we first average out directions of the incoming momentum @xmath8 , and then of the outgoing momentum @xmath9 , leading to @xmath42 for three - dimensional systems , where @xmath43 is the angular - averaged @xmath0-matrix .    to obtain the three - body ( dimer - atom ) s - wave scattering length @xmath44 ,",
    "the total energy @xmath45 should be set to the binding energy @xmath46 of the two - body bound state , in the limit of vanishing incoming and outgoing momentum and frequency , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "this motivates us to introduce the dimer - atom scattering function @xmath48 for which the integral equation becomes @xmath49    in the limit when @xmath50 . here",
    ", the dimer - atom scattering length is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 t_k^{da}(p ) , \\label{eqn : a - scattering}\\ ] ] gives the full momentum dependence of the dimer - atom scattering function .",
    "the integral equation shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ieqn ] ) as well as the scattering function expression shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : a - scattering ] ) reduce to the known results for the equal - mass particles case  @xcite when @xmath53 .",
    "since only the fermion exchange process is taken into account in the born approximation , and that neglecting the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ieqn ] ) leads to @xmath54 , which is consistent with the many - body results  @xcite .",
    "however , we need to include both terms and solve the integral equation in order to find the exact dimer - atom scattering length .      next , we solve numerically the integral equation given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ieqn ] ) as a function of the mass ratio @xmath55 of the constituent particles of the dimer  @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", it is convenient to change the upper integration limit to a finite value by a change of variables , e.g. @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the resultant integral is calculated by using the gaussian - legendre quadrature method , and using this discretization , we reduce the integral equation to a matrix - eigenvalue problem .    [ htb ]    the exact solutions and the born approximation values of @xmath51 are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : a_da ] .",
    "when @xmath59 , we find @xmath4 , which is in agreement with the results previously found for equal - mass particles  @xcite . the scattering length @xmath44 increases ( decreases ) from this value with increasing ( decreasing ) mass ratio , and @xmath60 in the limit of @xmath61 as expected .",
    "these results exactly match the few - body results of petrov  @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach exactly recovers the few - body results for all mass ratios , since the diagrammatic approach is performed in momentum space , while the few body approach is performed in real space  @xcite .",
    "note that the born approximation values for @xmath44 are not in agreement with the exact values for any mass ratio , and that the disagreement increases rapidly with increasing mass ratio , but the general qualitative trend is captured by the born approximation as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_da ] .    [ htb ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_da_k ] , we show the scattering function @xmath62 as a function of the outgoing momentum @xmath63 for some mass ratios @xmath55 . when @xmath59 , this is a monotonically decreasing ( positive ) function of @xmath63 with a long tail .",
    "however , beyond some critical mass ratio , this behavior changes dramatically .",
    "for instance , when @xmath64 , after an initial rapid drop , @xmath62 function changes sign and becomes negative at @xmath65 .",
    "beyond this critical momentum , it reaches a minimum value and slowly decays to zero from the negative side . as the mass ratio gets lower ( higher ) ,",
    "@xmath62 changes sign at higher ( lower ) momenta .",
    "for instance , when @xmath66 , corresponding to a three - body system consisting of one @xmath67li atom and two @xmath68k atoms , it changes sign at least once at @xmath69 ( but it changes sign at least once at @xmath70 when @xmath71 ) .",
    "we find clear sign changes when @xmath72 , but we donot know whether @xmath62 changes sign for even lower mass ratios since precision issues obscure the results .    although our calculation is not reliable for mass ratios above @xmath5  @xcite , for illustration purposes , in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_da_k](b ) , we show @xmath73 $ ] as a function of @xmath63 when @xmath74 . in this case , the scattering function first changes sign and becomes negative at @xmath75 , but then it changes sign again and becomes positive at @xmath76 . since the large-@xmath63 behavior of this function is again obscured due to precision issues , as can be seen in the figure , we could not resolve whether it has more sign changes at larger @xmath63 values . however , we mention that as the mass ratio increases further to @xmath77 , @xmath62 changes sign at least 4 times , and the oscillating pattern becomes apparent .",
    "this effect could be related to the `` fall of a particle to the center '' phenomenon  @xcite , and to the emergence of three - body efimov bound states  @xcite , which are known to occur when the mass ratio is large .",
    "when the heavy a particles are separated from each other by a distance @xmath78 ( or equivalently @xmath79 ) , it is known that an exchange of a light b particle mediates an effective @xmath80 attraction between a particles . here",
    ", the coefficient @xmath81 increases with increasing mass ratio  @xcite .",
    "since a particles are fermions , this attraction competes with the pauli repulsion which manifests itself as a centrifugal @xmath82 potential , where @xmath83 is the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , when the masses are comparable ( @xmath84 ) , the pauli repulsion is about one order of magnitude stronger than the mediated attraction . when the mass ratio @xmath55 reaches a critical value , i.e. when @xmath85 , the effective interaction ( mediated attraction plus centrifugal repulsion ) between a particles vanishes .",
    "for the lowest p - wave angular momentum channel @xmath86 , this occurs when @xmath87 .    beyond this critical mass ratio ,",
    "there is a second critical mass ratio beyond which the effective attraction between a particles is strong enough that the a particles stay in an infinitely small region around each other , i.e. the remaining a particle falls to the center of the attraction  @xcite .",
    "this second critical mass ratio can be approximated by @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "for the lowest p - wave angular momentum channel @xmath86 , this occurs when @xmath89 .",
    "note that , since the b particle is already bound to one of the a particles , `` fall of a particle to the center '' is related to emergence of three - body efimov bound states .",
    "more accurate calculations show that the latter occurs when @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "having presented the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach for the three - body ( s - wave ) dimer - atom scattering , for all mass ratios @xmath55 , next we discuss the relevance of our results to the quantum phases of two - species fermi - fermi and bose - fermi mixtures of atomic gases at ultracold temperatures .",
    "it has been shown that  @xcite ( see  @xcite for experimental confirmation ) , in the strong - attraction or molecular limit , two - species fermi - fermi mixtures with population imbalance can be well - described by effective bose - fermi models , where fermion - fermion pairs behave as molecular bosons ( dimers ) and interact weakly with each other and with the remaining unpaired ( excess ) fermions .",
    "these simpler models only require accurate scattering lengths between two molecular bosons ( dimer - dimer , i.e. @xmath91 ) , and between a molecular boson and an unpaired fermion ( dimer - atom , i.e. @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the exact three- and four - body results in vacuum are sufficient to describe ultracold atomic mixtures in the molecular limit , since experiments are always performed at low densities .",
    "several fermionic atoms ( @xmath92li , @xmath68k , @xmath93sr  @xcite , and @xmath94yb  @xcite ) are being currently investigated , and experimental methods for studying two - species fermi - fermi mixtures are being developed in several groups , e.g.@xmath92li-@xmath68k mixture  @xcite . thus , anticipating future experiments involving various other mixtures , in table  [ table : ff ] , we list the exact dimer - atom scattering lengths for all possible mixtures .",
    "[ htb ]    .[table : ff ] the exact scattering length @xmath51 between a bosonic ab dimer ( consisting of one fermionic a atom and one fermionic b atom ) and a fermionic a atom is shown for a list of two - species fermi - fermi mixtures . here",
    ", @xmath44 is in units of the two - body scattering length between a and b particles @xmath3 , and the mass ratios @xmath55 are shown inside the parenthesis  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we pointed out above , the three - body scattering problem is universal for mass ratios below @xmath5 , and therefore , the dimer - atom scattering is proportional to the two - body scattering length @xmath3 with the proportionality factor depending only on the masses of the constituent particles .",
    "however , since three - body efimov bound states emerges for larger mass ratios  @xcite , this problem is not universal ( an additional parameter coming from the short - range three - body physics is needed for an accurate description ) , and our analysis does not include this non - universal effect  @xcite . in particular , the @xmath67li-@xmath93sr , @xmath67li-@xmath94yb and @xmath67li-@xmath95yb fermi - fermi mixtures and @xmath96li-@xmath94yb , and @xmath96li-@xmath95yb bose - fermi mixtures have mass ratios that are above the critical ratio for the emergence of three - body efimov bound states .",
    "in this paper , we used the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach to analyze the three - body scattering problem between two identical fermions and a third particle .",
    "the third particle could be a different species of fermion or a boson .",
    "we calculated the exact s - wave dimer - atom scattering length for all mass ratios , and our results exactly match the few - body results of petrov who obtained them by solving the three - body schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the diagrammatic @xmath0-matrix approach exactly recovers the few - body results for all mass ratios , since the diagrammatic approach is performed in momentum space , while the few - body approach is performed in real space  @xcite .",
    "we also discussed the relevance of our results to the quantum phases of two - species fermi - fermi and bose - fermi mixtures of atomic gases at ultracold temperatures .",
    "in particular , in the strong - attraction or molecular limit , these mixtures can be well - described by simpler effective models , where paired atoms behave as dimers and interact weakly with each other and with the remaining unpaired atoms .",
    "these effective descriptions require only the scattering lengths between two dimers , and between a dimer and an unpaired atom .",
    "anticipating future experiments , we listed the exact dimer - atom scattering lengths for all available two - species fermi - fermi and bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "in addition , we showed that , unlike that of the equal - mass particles case where the three - body scattering @xmath0-matrix decays monotonically as a function of the outgoing momentum , after an initial rapid drop , this function changes sign and becomes negative at large momenta and then decays slowly to zero when the mass ratio of the fermions to the third particle is higher than a critical value ( around @xmath1 ) .",
    "as the mass ratio gets higher , modulations of the @xmath0-matrix become more apparent with multiple sign changes .",
    "we argued that this effect could be related to the `` fall of a particle to the center '' phenomenon  @xcite and to the emergence of three - body efimov bound states  @xcite .",
