    "neutron stars in mass - transferring binaries accrete hydrogen and helium rich material from their companions at rates ranging from @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "this matter undergoes thermonuclear fusion within hours to days of reaching the neutron star surface , releasing @xmath11 per nucleon for solar abundances .",
    "the nuclear burning is thermally unstable on weakly magnetic neutron stars ( @xmath12 ) accreting at @xmath13 and produces energetic ( @xmath14 ) type i x - ray bursts when @xmath15 ( see lewin , van paradijs & taam 1995 and bildsten 1998b for recent reviews ; observationally , the nature of the time dependent burning in the regime @xmath16 is still not understood ) .",
    "the composition of the ashes from the unstable burning is still uncertain , but most certainly consists of heavy nuclei , potentially beyond the iron group ( hanawa , sugimoto & hashimoto 1983 ; wallace & woosley 1984 ; schatz et al .",
    "1997 ; schatz et al .",
    "1998 , koike et al . 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate for the first time the mix of nuclei made during _ thermally stable _ hydrogen / helium burning in the upper atmosphere of an accreting neutron star .",
    "this is appropriate for most accreting x - ray pulsars , where the local accretion rate is high enough for stable burning on the magnetic polar cap ( joss & li 1980 ; bildsten & brown 1997 ) , and for the bright `` z '' sources of hasinger and van der klis ( 1989 ) that are not regular type i bursters and accrete globally at @xmath17 . whereas accurately calculating the ashes from unstable",
    "burning requires time - dependent , three - dimensional modelling of the ignition and propagation of the flame , stable burning is time - independent and therefore calculation of the ashes is much more straightforward .",
    "the ashes are forced by accretion into the neutron star ocean and crust , replacing what was there at birth .",
    "the ensuing electron captures , neutron emissions and pycnonuclear reactions release energy locally and drive the matter neutron - rich ( bisnovatyi - kogan & chechetkin 1979 ; sato 1979 ; haensel & zdunik 1990 ; blaes et .",
    "al . 1990 ; bildsten 1998a ; brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ) .",
    "thus the composition of an accreted or accreting neutron star ocean and crust is very different from the primordial one ( see pethick and ravenhall 1995 for a recent discussion of the primordial crust ) and depends critically on the range and type of nuclei made during the h / he burning in the upper atmosphere .",
    "previous studies of accreting neutron star crusts presumed that iron is the sole product of nuclear burning in the upper atmosphere and is the only nucleus entering the neutron star crust .",
    "we find that the hydrogen burning on these rapidly accreting neutron stars is mostly via the rp process of wallace and woosley ( 1981 ) , resulting in a complicated mix of elements , _",
    "nearly all much heavier than iron .",
    "_    the thin outer crust of a neutron star ( before neutron drip at @xmath18@xmath19 ) is replaced by accretion of only @xmath20 of material .",
    "thus all of the neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries should have an accreted outer crust . indeed these objects accrete enough material to unambiguously replace their _ whole _",
    "crust ( down to the crust / core interface ) , which is typically a few percent of the total stellar mass ( ravenhall & pethick 1994 ) .",
    "the x - ray pulsars typically accrete from the wind of a massive companion at a rate @xmath21@xmath22 ( see bildsten et al .",
    "1997 for a recent overview ) and so are capable of replacing their outer crusts .",
    "a few of these objects ( smc x-1 , lmc x-4 , her x-1 ) are accreting at high enough rates or for long enough times ( as inferred by the @xmath23 mass companion to her x-1 ) to replace their whole crust",
    ".    knowledge of the composition and thermal properties of an accreting neutron star s ocean and crust is important for many studies .",
    "for example , the temperature and composition of the crust affects the thermal conductivity and the ohmic diffusion time there ( see brown & bildsten 1998 for a recent application / overview of this problem ) .",
    "the crustal composition determines the amount of heat deposited directly in the crust ( haensel & zdunik 1990 ; miralda - escude et al . 1990 ) and the rate of neutrino emission from the crust ( haensel , kaminker & yakovlev 1996 ) , both of which are important for finding the equilibrium core temperature of an accreting neutron star ( fujimoto et al .",
    "1984 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "the predicted frequencies of the so - far unobserved ocean g - modes depend directly on the average nuclear mass ( bildsten & cutler 1995 ; bildsten & cumming 1998 ) .",
    "we begin in  2 with an introduction to the basic equations we solve and a summary of the input microphysics . in  3 , we discuss the high accretion rate burning regime and explain why the burning is thermally stable at high accretion rates and why the helium ignites in a hydrogen - rich environment , thus providing an excellent site for the rp process . in  4 , we explain the overall thermal and compositional structure of the burning layer and provide convenient analytic expressions for the temperature and depth of the burning .",
    "section 5 contains an in - depth discussion of the nature of the rp process .",
    "we explain how the burning depends on the local accretion rate , with particular emphasis on the important role of the @xmath8p process in determining the final average mass of the nuclei .",
    "we conclude in  6 with a summary of our work and some speculations about how these results will impact studies of the neutron star crust and ocean . in the appendix ,",
    "we describe how we calculate the radiative and conductive opacities for the complex mixtures produced by the hydrogen / helium burning .",
    "the plane - parallel nature of the neutron star atmosphere means that the physics of nuclear burning depends on the accretion rate per unit area , @xmath24 ( fujimoto , hanawa & miyaji 1981 , hereafter fhm ) .",
    "this parameter determines the local behavior on the neutron star and need not be the same everywhere , especially on accreting x - ray pulsars . the local zero metallicity eddington rate ( the accretion rate at which the outgoing radiation exerts a force comparable to gravity ) is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the thomson scattering cross - section , @xmath27 is the proton mass , @xmath28 is the speed of light , @xmath29 is the hydrogen mass fraction , and @xmath30 is the stellar radius . in this paper , we use the eddington accretion rate for solar composition ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32  km , @xmath33 , as our basic unit for the local accretion rate .",
    "steady accretion modifies the equations of particle continuity and entropy for a hydrostatic settling atmosphere ( fhm ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "we write these equations in a coordinate system of fixed pressure @xmath34 , so that the accreted matter flows through the coordinates as it is compressed by accretion of fresh material from above .",
    "hydrostatic balance ( the ram pressure of the accretion flow is negligible ) yields @xmath35 , where the column depth @xmath36 ( in g @xmath37 ) is defined by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ( we neglect general relativistic corrections ) .",
    "the continuity equation for an element @xmath40 ( with number density @xmath41 ) is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the summed rates of particle creation and destruction processes .",
    "for these high accretion rates , there is not time for differential settling and all elements co - move downward at the speed needed to satisfy mass continuity , @xmath44 ( wallace , woosley & weaver 1982 ; bildsten , salpeter & wasserman 1993 ) .",
    "we define a mass fraction @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the baryon number of species @xmath40 and expand the continuity equation to obtain @xmath47 the equation for the entropy is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the energy release rate from nuclear burning and @xmath50 is the heat flux .",
    "we write the entropy as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 for an adiabatic change and @xmath53 is the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "since the temperature can depend on both time and pressure , we find @xmath54 equations ( [ eq : contin ] ) and ( [ eq : entrop ] ) describe the hydrostatic evolution of the neutron star atmosphere while constantly accreting . in our steady - state calculations ,",
    "we neglect the time - dependent terms in these equations .",
    "we solve the continuity and entropy equations in connection with a nuclear reaction network to determine the nuclear energy generation rate @xmath49 in equation ( [ eq : entrop ] ) and the nuclear abundances @xmath55 .",
    "the nuclear reaction network used here is described in detail in schatz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the references therein ( see also herndl et al .",
    "1995 , van wormer et al .",
    "1994 , and wiescher et al .",
    "1986 for discussions of the reaction rates ) .",
    "the network includes 631 nuclei between hydrogen and @xmath56sn covering the range from stability to the proton drip line .",
    "the types of reactions considered are all proton , neutron and @xmath8 induced reactions as well as photodisintegration , @xmath57 decay and electron capture . for most nuclei in the range @xmath58 and @xmath59 the temperature and density dependent weak interaction rates are taken from the compilation of fuller , fowler & newman ( 1980 , 1982a , 1982b ) .",
    "these weak interaction rate data include energy losses due to emission of neutrinos in electron captures and @xmath57 decays .",
    "since similar data for heavier nuclei are not available , the @xmath60-decay rates of nuclei with @xmath61 were approximated using temperature and density independent earth rates ( for a justification see schatz et al .",
    "energy loss via neutrinos is neglected for these nuclei .",
    "electron captures do not play an important role for the density regime in which we work .",
    "electron screening is treated according to graboske et al .",
    "( 1973 ) and itoh et al .",
    "( 1979 ) .    for the equation of state , we assume the ions behave as an ideal gas ( coulomb corrections to the ion equation of state are unimportant at the column depths of interest to us ) and we use the interpolation formulae of paczynski ( 1983 ) to account for the partially degenerate electrons .",
    "the heat flux through the atmosphere is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radiation constant .",
    "the opacity @xmath64 is set by electron scattering , free - free absorption and conduction . in the appendix",
    ", we discuss in detail how we calculate each of these contributions for the complex mixtures produced by the hydrogen / helium burning .",
    "we assume an initial solar composition ( anders and grevesse 1989 ) of the accreted material and a neutron star with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the influence of these parameters on our results is discussed later .",
    "the only boundary condition that has to be chosen is the radiation flux exiting the top of the atmosphere . for these steady - state models at high accretion rates ,",
    "the flux is dominated by the nuclear energy release from the conversion of hydrogen and helium to heavy elements ( @xmath67 5 mev per nucleon ) .",
    "there is also energy release from gravitational settling and energy generated in the crust due to electron captures , neutron emission and pycnonuclear reactions ( see brown & bildsten 1998 for a discussion of this issue ) .",
    "however , these contributions to the flux are small ( @xmath68 ) compared to the nuclear energy release , and we do not include them here . in particular , we drop the terms proportional to @xmath53 on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : entrop ] ) .",
    "our approach is to guess the flux at the top of the atmosphere , integrate to the base of the burning layer and then compare the flux generated by the nuclear burning to our initial estimate .",
    "we find that this procedure converges to give the correct upper boundary condition in only a few iterations .",
    "for the high accretion rates of interest to us , the temperature at the depth where burning occurs is always in excess of @xmath69 k , so the hydrogen burns either via the hot cno cycle or , at the higher temperatures at later stages , via the rp process . during the hot cno cycle the timescale for proton captures is shorter than that for subsequent @xmath60 decays . the time to go around the catalytic loop",
    "is set by the @xmath60 decay lifetimes of @xmath70o ( @xmath71  s ) and @xmath72o ( @xmath73  s ) and is _ temperature independent_. the @xmath60-decays fix the hydrogen burning rate at ( hoyle & fowler 1965 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mass fraction of cno in the accumulating matter .",
    "the timescale to consume all of the hydrogen is then @xmath76 or about one day for solar metallicity . for high accretion rates (",
    "especially when the burning is stable ) , the matter reaches high enough temperatures for helium ignition before the hydrogen has been exhausted .",
    "the helium burning then occurs in a hydrogen rich environment ( lamb & lamb 1978 ; taam & picklum 1978 , 1979 ; fhm ; taam 1982 ) .    for normal or sub - solar metallicities and accretion rates in the regime @xmath77 ,",
    "the helium ignition is thermally unstable and results in a type i x - ray burst . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "the helium burns at a temperature ( @xmath5 ) where the burning is _ thermally stable _ because the nuclear energy generation rate is less temperature sensitive than the radiative cooling ( fhm ) .",
    "this allows a rough estimate of the critical accretion rate @xmath78 where the burning becomes stable ( bildsten 1998b ) , @xmath79 in which we take a nominal value @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the thomson scattering opacity .",
    "bildsten ( 1998b ) recently reviewed the accretion rate regimes originally introduced by fhm .",
    "the high local accretion rates of the x - ray pulsars are the standard argument as to why they do nt burst ( joss & li 1980 , bildsten & brown 1997 ) .",
    "the simple calculation which gives equation ( [ eq : mdotsted ] ) is not accurate enough to say whether @xmath82 is above or below the eddington rate .",
    "fhm estimated @xmath83 ( they called it @xmath84 in their table 1 ) for 3 different neutron stars ( here @xmath85 ) .",
    "they found @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mdotsted ] ) agrees to within 2030% , giving @xmath89 for the same three masses and radii . to accurately determine if the burning is thermally stable requires solving the time - dependent equations numerically .",
    "ayasli & joss ( 1982 ) and taam , woosley & lamb ( 1996 ) performed time - dependent calculations at accretion rates comparable to the eddington limit and found that the burning is thermally unstable when @xmath90 .",
    "ayasli & joss ( 1982 ) also carried out some calculations with super - eddington accretion rates ( by a factor of a few ) and found thermal stability .",
    "however , there has not been a thorough survey of the dependence of the critical accretion rate @xmath91 on @xmath92 , @xmath30 and composition .",
    "our focus in this paper is calculating the nucleosynthesis when the burning is thermally stable . in this regime ,",
    "the helium is consumed over a time interval of less than 20 minutes and the resulting enhancement of the number of cno seed nuclei together with breakout from the cno cycle leads to a rapid consumption of hydrogen via the rp process .",
    "steady - state burning of hydrogen and helium takes place in three phases : hydrogen burning via the hot cno cycle at low densities (  [ burn ] ) , mixed hydrogen and helium burning via the 3@xmath8 reaction and the @xmath8p and rp processes when helium ignites (   [ burn_ign ] and [ burn_hhe ] ) , and pure helium burning via @xmath8 captures after the exhaustion of hydrogen (  [ burn_he ] ) . for all accretion rates where the burning is in steady - state ,",
    "consumption of hydrogen by the hot cno cycle is unimportant before the helium ignites .",
    "it is helium ignition which acts as the trigger for hydrogen burning . to understand this",
    ", we write the depth at which hydrogen would be consumed by the hot cno cycle as @xmath93 , or , using equation ( [ eq : cno_burn ] ) , @xmath94 for the high accretion rates of interest here , @xmath95 is always much greater than the column depth at which helium ignites , @xmath96 ( see the estimate of @xmath96 in eq . [",
    "[ eq : yburn ] ] below ) .",
    "thus the helium ignites before significant amounts of hydrogen are burned by the hot cno cycle that when breakout occurs at high accretion rates , the limited number of available seed nuclei and the short time remaining before the onset of the 3@xmath8 reaction limits the hydrogen consumption via breakout reactions prior to helium ignition to only 10% of the available fuel . ] .",
    "rapid consumption of hydrogen by the rp process then follows .",
    "we have calculated steady - state models for local accretion rates between @xmath97 and 60 .",
    "the temperature , density and composition as a function of column depth are shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] for four accretion rates , @xmath98 and 50 , which we will discuss in detail .",
    "the steep rise in the mean molecular weight indicates the location of most of the hydrogen burning .",
    "figure  [ fig : opac ] shows the opacity @xmath64 for these models .",
    "the opacity `` bump '' , particularly prominent at low accretion rates , is due to free - free absorption .",
    "this dominates electron scattering after the heavy elements are made and until the opacity is set by electron conduction ( see appendix for a full discussion ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : trho ] shows the temperature - density profiles .",
    "the region to the left of the dashed line is where the temperature is high enough so that the positron fraction exceeds 10% .",
    "we have safely stayed in the regime where we can neglect positrons , confining our calculations to @xmath99 .",
    "we show later that this limit coincides with the onset of nuclear statistical equilibrium , where the outcome of the nucleosynthesis is simply determined by thermodynamics and does not need to be calculated in detail .    figure  [ fig : abut ] shows the abundances of hydrogen and helium as a function of time and column depth .",
    "it is clear that nearly all the hydrogen burning occurs where the helium ignites .",
    "we make a simple estimate of this location by matching the helium lifetime to the @xmath100 reaction to the time it takes to cross a scale height . using the energy generation rate for helium burning via the 3@xmath8 reaction ( @xmath101 )",
    ", we write @xmath102 ( taam 1981 , fushiki & lamb 1987 , bildsten 1995 ) where @xmath103 is the energy release from @xmath104c . using the temperature - density relation for an atmosphere with pure thomson scattering and a constant flux @xmath105",
    ", we find that the helium ignition temperature is given by the solution to @xmath106 \\exp\\left({-44\\over t_8}\\right)\\ ] ] ( bildsten 1998b ) , where we write the energy released per gram of accreted material in units of @xmath107 as @xmath108 and the accretion rate in units of @xmath109 as @xmath110 .",
    "solving this transcendental equation for the temperature gives the pressure at which the helium burns and , most importantly , how these quantities depend on @xmath24 , @xmath92 , @xmath30 and the abundances . in order to simplify the transcendental ,",
    "we expand the exponential about the temperature of @xmath111 ( in the middle of the range we are interested in ) so that @xmath112 .",
    "some accuracy is compromised because of this approximation , but not much .",
    "we thus find @xmath113 and @xmath114 as the temperature and column density at the helium burning location .",
    "these estimates compare well with our numerical results ( we take @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath31 , and @xmath118 ) . equation ( [ eq : yburn ] )",
    "accurately gives the location where @xmath119% of the helium is burned .",
    "the temperature estimate is consistently 20% too high ( for the same location ) .",
    "we have also checked the dependence of the burning conditions on gravity for a fixed @xmath120 model .",
    "we find that the burning takes place at higher temperatures , lower densities and higher column depths for a lower gravity , confirming the gravity dependence of equations ( [ eq : tburn ] ) and ( [ eq : yburn ] ) .",
    "thus our simple estimate accurately reproduces the scalings seen in the numerical simulations .",
    "when the helium ignites , mixed hydrogen and helium burning occurs via the 3@xmath8 reaction , the @xmath8p process and the rp process .",
    "the ignition of @xmath100-burning and subsequent carbon production in a hydrogen rich environment provides additional seeds which accelerate the burning of hydrogen .",
    "the @xmath8p process is a series of ( @xmath8,p ) reactions and proton captures starting with the @xmath70o(@xmath8,p)@xmath121f reaction .",
    "this is a pure helium burning process since for each proton released in an ( @xmath8,p ) reaction a proton is captured in a subsequent ( p,@xmath122 ) reaction ( wallace and woosley 1981 ) .",
    "hydrogen must be present for the @xmath8p process to play a role , since proton capture reactions provide the link between the @xmath123c produced by the 3@xmath8 reaction , and the @xmath70o at the beginning of the @xmath8p process .",
    "most of the hydrogen is burned by the rp process ( rapid proton capture process ) , a series of fast proton captures and slow @xmath60-decays close to the proton drip line ( wallace and woosley 1981 ) .",
    "we show later that the typical mass of nuclei at the endpoint of the rp process ( @xmath124 ) is around 60100 and is determined both by the exhaustion of hydrogen and the prevalence of the @xmath8p process .    before describing our detailed results , we start with a simple picture of the mixed hydrogen and helium burning .",
    "imagine that helium burns only via the 3@xmath8 reaction and breakout from the hot cno cycle , for example via the @xmath72o(@xmath8,@xmath122)@xmath125ne reaction .",
    "then , @xmath125ne is the seed nucleus for hydrogen burning via the rp process .",
    "neglecting the small amount of hydrogen burned before helium ignition , for solar abundance there are 38 protons per @xmath125ne seed nucleus .",
    "if there are no catalytic loops , the ensuing rp process would produce nuclei with a typical mass @xmath126 after all the hydrogen is burned .",
    "we generalize this simple estimate to the case where helium is burning via the @xmath8p process , by assuming that only one endpoint nucleus is produced from the @xmath8p process ( mass number @xmath127 ) , which again serves as the seed nucleus for the rp process . the typical mass @xmath124 of the endpoint of the rp process then depends on the mass fraction of helium burned into seed nuclei for the rp process ( @xmath128 ) and the endpoint of the helium burning ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath129 ( schatz et al .",
    "thus the strong temperature sensitivity of the @xmath130,p ) reactions in the @xmath8p process is imprinted on the rp process ashes . in this section ,",
    "we first describe the physics that determines @xmath127 and show that the temperature at the depth of helium ignition is the most important parameter .",
    "we then discuss the rp process and the resulting distribution of elements , and show that equation ( [ eq : arp ] ) is a good estimate of our numerical results .",
    "crucial for the rp process is the extent to which @xmath8-induced reactions other than the 3@xmath8 reaction can take place . the major limiting factor is the coulomb barrier for the @xmath8 particles , which increases rapidly towards heavier nuclei . in figure  [ tr ] ,",
    "the dotted line shows the temperatures and densities where the @xmath72o(@xmath8,@xmath122)@xmath125ne rate equals the @xmath72o @xmath57 decay rate . to the right of this line ,",
    "breakout from the hot cno cycle can occur .",
    "the dashed lines show where the ( @xmath8,p ) reaction rate on @xmath70o , @xmath131ne , @xmath132 mg , @xmath133si , @xmath134s and @xmath135ar equals the rate of destruction ( by @xmath57 decay and proton capture ) of each of these isotopes .",
    "the @xmath136 process will proceed via a particular @xmath130,p ) reaction if the temperature and density of a fluid element reach the corresponding threshold ( dashed line ) during helium burning .",
    "otherwise , the @xmath136 process will end and the reaction flow towards heavier nuclei will continue via the rp process .    for nuclei above @xmath131ne proton",
    "captures can in principle compete with @xmath8-induced reactions as the proton capture rates are typically much faster than the ( @xmath8,p ) reaction rates .",
    "however , at the temperatures where the helium burning occurs , the ( @xmath122,p ) photodisintegration reactions are in balance with the ( p,@xmath122 ) reactions , which strongly hampers effective proton captures .",
    "this does not mean , as it is often concluded , that proton captures are always negligible .",
    "in fact , the deviations of the thresholds shown in figure  [ tr ] from the smooth behavior at low densities are due to proton captures . for example , let s consider @xmath132 mg . in this case , the nuclei @xmath132 mg and @xmath137al are in ( p,@xmath122)-(@xmath122,p ) equilibrium determined by the saha equation .",
    "however , the @xmath137al(p,@xmath122)@xmath138si reaction operating on the low @xmath137al equilibrium abundance establishes a net reaction flow from @xmath132 mg to @xmath138si .",
    "this is similar to the 2p capture reactions discussed in grres et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and schatz et al .",
    "this type of proton capture is a weak process but goes with @xmath139 , and therefore there is a critical density above which the ( @xmath8,p ) reaction competes with proton captures rather than with the density independent @xmath60 decay . for @xmath132 mg",
    "this happens at densities above @xmath140 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ tr ] , the threshold for the ( @xmath8,p ) reaction behaves very differently in that regime because of the very different density and temperature dependence of the competing reaction . for @xmath132",
    "mg , @xmath133si , @xmath134s , and @xmath135ar , the critical density is such that proton captures play an important role in determining the @xmath8p process path at these isotopes . for example",
    ", proton captures move the border for the @xmath132mg(@xmath8,p)@xmath141al reaction to higher temperatures , which is why the @xmath8p process needs accretion rates above 20@xmath142 to proceed beyond @xmath132 mg .",
    "proton captures also lead to an inversion of the thresholds for the @xmath133si(@xmath8,p)@xmath143p and the @xmath134s(@xmath8,p)@xmath144cl reactions for densities above @xmath145 . on the other hand , in the cases of @xmath70o and @xmath131ne",
    "the next isotone is proton unbound and the necessary densities are much higher , roughly @xmath146 ( grres et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ tr ] are the evolutionary tracks for fluid elements in the temperature - density plane at various accretion rates .",
    "the fat line segment indicates where hydrogen burning occurs ( from 90% to 10% of the initial hydrogen abundance ) and clearly shows that the temperature - density track for all accretion rates crosses the threshold for the @xmath72o(@xmath8,@xmath122)@xmath125ne reaction before exhausting the hydrogen .",
    "thus at all accretion rates , there is a breakout of the hot cno cycle .",
    "there are uncertainties in the @xmath72o(@xmath8,@xmath122)@xmath125ne reaction rate by factors of 510 ( mao et al . 1995 , 1996 , wiescher , grres & schatz 1999 ) .",
    "however , the strong temperature dependence of the reaction rate means that changes in the reaction rate within the uncertainties have hardly any impact on the reaction flow and the breakout of the hot cno cycle . to confirm this ,",
    "we have performed a test calculation with @xmath97 and the @xmath72o(@xmath8,@xmath122)@xmath125ne reaction rate reduced by a factor of ten .",
    "the only difference we find in this case is that the column depth of the burning zone is deeper by 8% resulting in a slightly longer cno burning phase before the breakout . as we discuss in ",
    "[ burn_he ] , this slightly increases the amount of helium that survives hydrogen burning . _ therefore we conclude that steady state hydrogen burning must always take place via the rp process .",

    "_    what determines the endpoint of the rp process for accretion rates @xmath184 ?",
    "the rp process ends either when all the hydrogen is consumed or when the proton capture rates become too slow because of the increasing coulomb barrier .",
    "the effect of the coulomb barrier can be estimated from the formula given in woosley and weaver ( 1984 ) @xmath185 \\frac{t_9^{1/3}}{4.25 - 1.33 t_9^{1/3}},\\ ] ] where @xmath186 is the maximum charge number that can be synthesized in a time @xmath187 at a density @xmath188 , a temperature @xmath189 ( in 10@xmath190  k ) and a proton abundance @xmath29 .",

    "the flows are always close to the proton drip line all the way up to the heaviest nucleus synthesized , indicating that it is the @xmath60-decays and not the proton captures that set the timescale .",
    "the deviation of the rp process path from the proton drip line by 1 or 2 mass units is in most cases due to photodisintegration of the weakly - bound proton - rich nuclei .",
    "we find that hydrogen is completely consumed by the rp process near the depth where helium ignites .",
    "no hydrogen reaches deeper regions of the atmosphere , and electron capture on hydrogen does not occur when the burning is in steady - state , as earlier speculated by taam et al .",
    "the only exception is at very high accretion rates , typically beyond @xmath193 , where photodisintegration hampers efficient hydrogen burning via the rp process beyond @xmath159ni .",
    "indeed , figure  [ flow ] shows that , at @xmath168 , there is a very weak reaction flow via hydrogen electron capture .",
    "but even at @xmath194 the hydrogen mass fraction that is left after the rp process burning is 0.4% .",
    "these results contradict the speculations of taam et al .",
    "( 1996 ) about the possible stabilizing effects of hydrogen electron captures at large depths .",
    "a likely explanation for this is that the network of taam et al . did not include nuclei with @xmath195",
    "however , from the simple arguments giving equation ( 13 ) , it is clear that the rp process during steady - state burning always leads to production of nuclei beyond iron .",
    "thus the omission of nuclei beyond @xmath196 would result in under - consumption of hydrogen , and lead one to the incorrect conclusion that hydrogen survives the nuclear burning .",
    "since it is hydrogen consumption that limits the rp process , the endpoint is roughly given by equation ( [ eq : arp ] ) .",
    "the important parameters are the endpoint of the @xmath8p process and the amount of helium burned into seed nuclei during hydrogen burning ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "we have shown that @xmath152 can in principle be obtained from figure  [ tr ] , but @xmath128 is more difficult to estimate , since some mass fraction of helium ( @xmath198 ) survives the hydrogen burning phase ( see table  [ endpoints ] ) .",
    "this helium is not available for the production of rp process seed nuclei and burns later in the pure helium burning phase discussed in  [ burn_he ] .",
    "table  [ endpoints ] shows that the amount of helium surviving hydrogen burning is 23% of the initial helium abundance at @xmath199 .",
    "helium survives the hydrogen burning because the timescale to burn helium via the 3@xmath8-reaction , @xmath200 , is longer than the timescale for reaching the last isotope in the rp process , @xmath201 , which is the sum of the lifetimes of all the nuclei along the calculated reaction paths .",
    "figure  [ tau ] shows @xmath200 and @xmath201 as a function of mass number for @xmath202 and 20 .",
    "when calculating @xmath201 , we neglect the influence of photodisintegration and of the change in hydrogen abundance during the burning .",

    "the timescale for helium burning is indeed significantly longer than the timescale for the rp process to reach its endpoint and burn all the hydrogen . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "the two timescales become comparable , and the amount of helium remaining unburned after hydrogen exhaustion is less .",
    "the final abundance distribution of the rp process ashes from steady state burning is shown in figure  [ abu ] for @xmath204 , 5 , 20 , 50 , and 60 . as discussed above",
    ", the higher the accretion rate , the heavier the nuclei produced until , at @xmath205 , the rp process gets stuck in the zr - nb cycle at @xmath206 . at this accretion rate , nuclear statistical equilibrium starts to play a role during the final burning stage , and drives some nuclei back into @xmath159ni .",
    "these two effects lead to the `` double peak '' structure of the abundance pattern with maxima around @xmath196 and @xmath206 . at @xmath207 ,",
    "nuclear statistical equilibrium dominates and all nuclei are converted into iron peak nuclei , mainly @xmath159ni .",

    "we find that the coulomb barrier should not inhibit the rp process even for these heavy nuclei .",

    "the three terms in equation ( [ eq : gff ] ) are physically motivated .",
    "the first is the degeneracy correction to the electron velocity .",
    "we follow cox & giuli ( 1968 ,  16.2 ) , who corrected for the electron degeneracy by integrating the free - free absorption cross - section over the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the second term is the elwert factor ( elwert 1939 ) ; a correction to the electron wavefunction normalization due to the coulomb potential ( pratt & tseng 1975 ; lee et al .",
    "1976 ; bethe & salpeter 1977 ) .",
    "the elwert factor depends on the ratio of the coulomb energy to the electron energy , parameterized by @xmath267 , and the energy of the photon involved in the transition .",
    "we write an average photon energy @xmath268 , and find that @xmath256 gives a good fit .",

    "we chose the particular form of the function @xmath269 that gave the best fit .",
    "the third term includes the effect of relativity on the coulomb scattering .",
    "bethe & salpeter ( 1977 ) show that in the extreme relativistic limit , the free - free cross section @xmath271 is proportional to the electron energy @xmath272 , whereas in the non - relativistic case @xmath273 .",
    "the gaunt factor rises rapidly at high temperatures to allow for this different scaling , as found in the numerical calculations of itoh and coworkers ( itoh et al .",

    "we thus added a term @xmath275 at high temperatures , choosing the transition temperature @xmath276 which gave the best fit .",
    "the heat transport is dominated by electron conduction once the material becomes degenerate .",
    "yakovlev & urpin ( 1980 , hereafter yu ) wrote the conductivity as @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the electron collision frequency and @xmath279 ( @xmath249 is the electron fermi energy not including the rest mass ) .",
    "we calculate electron - electron collisions using the fit of potekhin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , but these make a small contribution to the total collision frequency ( typically @xmath280% ) .",
    "the conductivity is mainly determined by electron - ion collisions , for which we have generalized yu s results to an ionic mixture .",
    "the scalings become evident by writing @xmath281 , where we sum independently over each ion and @xmath282 is the coulomb logarithm . since @xmath283 and @xmath284 , we find @xmath285 a generalized form of the familiar yu result , where @xmath286 and we have inserted the correct prefactor as found by yu .",
    "the coulomb logarithm is @xmath287 ( yu ) , where the second term is the relativistic correction to the cross - section , and @xmath288 and @xmath289 are the limits of the integral over impact parameters .",
    "the lower limit is set by the electron wavelength @xmath290 .",
    "yu give a good fit for the upper limit as @xmath291 , where the debye screening length @xmath292 for a mixture of ions is @xmath293 ( shu 1991 ) and @xmath63 is the average spacing between ions , defined by @xmath294 . if we also define @xmath295 for the mixture as @xmath296 ( hubbard & lampe 1969 ) , then we find @xmath297.\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , together with equations ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond3 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond4 ] ) , gives a general expression for the electron - ion collision frequency for an ion mixture .",
    "for the case of a single species of ion , @xmath298 and @xmath299 and these equations reduce to the expressions of yu .",
    "note that the scalings in the mixed case are _ not _ those obtained by substituting the mean value of z into the expressions of yu .    in figure",
    "[ fig : appkappa ] , we show the resulting opacity for pure @xmath159fe in the @xmath188@xmath300 plane .",
    "the solid lines show where the dominant opacity source changes from electron scattering to free - free absorption , and from free - free opacity to conduction , i.e. where @xmath301 and @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the conductive opacity .",
    "the line @xmath302 agrees well with figure 2 of gudmundsson , pethick & epstein ( 1983 ) , who used the los alamos opacities for pure @xmath159fe .",

    "significant @xmath305@xmath274 pair production occurs .",
    "we do not include this in our calculations as we never encounter this regime in our steady - state models ( see figure [ fig : trho ] ) , thus our opacity calculations are not valid in this region . we choose iron here as an illustrative example to compare to previous work . in practice , as we show in this paper , there is a rich mixture of elements produced by the nuclear burning .",
    "we now compare our opacity calculations to those of previous workers .",
    "the main difference is in the treatment of free - free opacity .",
    "taam , woosley & lamb ( 1996 ) in their time - dependent simulations used the kepler code of weaver , zimmerman & woosley ( 1978 ) ( see also woosley & weaver 1984 ) which calculates opacities from the analytic fits of iben ( 1975 ) .",
    "iben ( 1975 ) provides fitting formulae to the radiative opacities of cox & stewart ( 1970a , b ) and the conductive opacities of hubbard & lampe ( 1969 ) ( for non - relativistic electrons ) and canuto ( 1970 ) ( for relativistic electrons ) .",
    "fujimoto and coworkers ( fhm ; fujimoto et al .",
    "1984 ; hanawa & fujimoto 1984 , 1986 ) also used this same fit .",
    "joss ( 1977 ) , joss & li ( 1980 ) and ayasli & joss ( 1982 ) used iben s fit to the conductive opacity , but a fit by stellingwerf ( 1975 ) to the radiative opacities of cox , king & tabor ( 1973 ) .",
    "more recently , potekhin , chabrier & yakovlev ( 1997 ) used the opal opacity library ( rogers , swenson & iglesias 1996 ) for their study of cooling neutron stars with accreted envelopes with pure h , he , c , o and fe layers .",
    "as an example , we have compared our calculation of the total opacity @xmath64 with that obtained using the fit of iben ( 1975 ) for the free - free contribution .",
    "we find that for pure @xmath159fe at @xmath306 and @xmath307 ( the @xmath188 and @xmath300 regime for which free - free opacity becomes important in our models ) , the total opacity we calculate is 30% to 50% larger than that using iben s fit ."
