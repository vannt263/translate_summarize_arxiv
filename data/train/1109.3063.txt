    "we find a lagrange point for every pair of the metal atom and the c atom in benzene for * mb@xmath31 * , * mb@xmath32 * and * mb@xmath33*. as regards * mb@xmath34 * , however , it is found for only two out of six fe  c pairs .",
    "in contrast , the ligand parts are almost same for all of the complexes .",

    "[ fig : stressv ] , the case of * mb@xmath31 * is displayed in the plane including a v atom and two c atoms in the benzene .",
    "as for the electronic stress tensor , we show the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector in the left panel .",
    "the sign of the eigenvalue tells whether electrons at a certain point in space feel tensile force ( positive eigenvalue ) or compressive force ( negative eigenvalue ) , and the eigenvector tells the direction of the force .",
    "the largest eigenvalue is considered to give the directionality of the chemical bond . in the region between the c atoms",
    ", we see that there is a positive eigenvalue region ( shown in red ) and eigenvectors form a bundle of flow lines , which connects the c atoms .",
    "this pattern is called  spindle structure \" that characterizes the covalent bond @xcite . in the region between the c and v atoms",
    ", we can again see a bundle of flow lines that connects two atoms but the eigenvalue is negative ( shown in blue ) .",
    "we call this pattern  pseudo - spindle structure \" .",
    "now , we turn to the tension vector field , which is shown in the right panel .",
    "we see that tension vectors basically go out from nuclei in a spherically symmetric manner .",
    "these vectors sharply change their direction where the vectors from different nuclei meet .",
    "this sharp change creates some surface - like structures in the tension field , and they seem to separate space into subspaces to which atoms in a molecule belong . this surface",
    "is called  lagrange surface \" @xcite . in the case of * mb@xmath31 * , lagrange surface always includes a lagrange point where the tension vanishes .",
    "the cases of * mb@xmath32 * and * mb@xmath33 * are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : stresscr ] and [ fig : stressmn ] respectively .",
    "they have a same pattern as * mb@xmath31 * : the spindle structure between the c atoms , the pseudo - spindle structure between the c and the metal atom , and a lagrange point between each atom pair .",
    "as for * mb@xmath34 * , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : stressfe ] and [ fig : stressfe2 ] , the stress tensor has the same pattern but , as mentioned earlier , there are some metal - c pairs without a lagrange point",

    "[ fig : stressv ] to [ fig : stressmn ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : stressfe ] or [ fig : stressfe2 ] by visual inspection .",
    "in fact , however , the norm of tension vector goes down @xmath37 or smaller at the lagrange point whereas we can not find the norm smaller than @xmath38 between fe(1 ) and c(13 ) or c(15 ) .",
    "this is the reason why we judge there is no lagrange point between these atom pairs .    from the view point of the electronic stress tensor",
    ", we may conclude that the v , cr , and mn complexes have similar features but the fe complex is slightly different .",
    "we now would like to compare this point with the conventional mo analysis .",

    "the occupation numbers are given in the parentheses .",
    "more detailed occupation numbers are given in table [ tab : occupation ] which is reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite for convenience . from fig .",
    "[ fig : no_cr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : no_mn ] , it is easy to specify bonding and anti - bonding orbitals for * mb@xmath32 * and * mb@xmath33 * respectively : @xmath39 and @xmath40 are bonding orbitals and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are anti - bonding orbitals .",
    "the situation is not so clear for * mb@xmath34*. @xmath39 can be specified as bonding and @xmath41 and @xmath42 as anti - bonding but @xmath43 can be regarded to have bonding orbital feature in addition to @xmath40 . in other words , although @xmath44 to @xmath45 of * mb@xmath33 * have been assigned to non - bonding - type orbitals in the formal classification @xcite , @xmath43 of * mb@xmath34 * , in fact , is not 100% non - bonding and carries some bonding orbital nature .",
    "such difference between * mb@xmath34 * and other three complexes may be reflected in the difference in the lagrange point pattern we see above .",
    "finally , we quantify the relative strength of the metal - benzene bond among these complexes by the mo - based bond order and by the energy density - based bond order @xmath0 .",
    "we are concerned with whether two ways give a consistent result . as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , bond order can be defined by the half of the difference between the sum of occupation numbers of bonding orbitals and that of anti - bonding orbitals .",
    "then , the bond order of * mb@xmath31 * , * mb@xmath32 * and * mb@xmath33 * is respectively 1.60 , 1.34 , and 1.07 ( see table [ tab : occupation ] ) and the ratio is @xmath46 . as for @xmath0 , it would be reasonable to sum @xmath0 of metal - c bonds to obtain the relative strength among * mb@xmath31 * , * mb@xmath32 * and * mb@xmath33*. @xmath0 for the metal - benzene bonds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : istc_be2 ] . by symmetry , it is sufficient to add three of them",
    ". then , the ratio of * mb@xmath31 * to * mb@xmath32 * to * mb@xmath33 * regarding the metal - benzene bond is given by @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with mo - based bond order .",
    "the mo bond order for * mb@xmath34 * is not calculated because of the ambiguity in the bonding orbital as described earlier , but since the occupation number of anti - bonding orbital @xmath42 is considerably larger for * mb@xmath34 * than for * mb@xmath33 * , the metal - benzene bond in * mb@xmath34 * should be weaker than that of * mb@xmath33*. it is also not capable to compare quantitatively * mb@xmath34 * and others using @xmath0 due to the different lagrange point patterns between them .",
    "however , the absence of the lagrange point in * mb@xmath34 * suggests that the metal - benzene bond in * mb@xmath34 * is weaker than that in * mb@xmath33*.      in this section , we discuss the results for the open - lantern - type dinuclear transition metal complexes .",

    "cr distance is calculated to be 1.855 , which is moderately shorter than the experimental value of 1.960 . also , the bond order of the cr ",
    "cr bond is calculated to be 2.532 , much smaller than the formal bond order of 4 .",
    "this can explain the fact that the complex is easy to dissociate into two mononuclear complexes in solution .",

    "@xcite , we compute the electronic stress tensor and derived quantities as explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : calc ] .",
    "the result of the lagrange point search is shown in fig.[fig : oltc_be ] .",
    "we would like to focus on the metal  metal bond for these complexes .",
    "let us begin by studying the bond orders . the energy density bond order @xmath0 for cr  cr is 1.42 and that for mo ",
    "mo is 1.03 .",
    "this is contrary to the mo bond order , which is calculated to be 2.532 for cr  cr and 3.412 for mo ",
    "mo @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy is suspected to come from our definition of bond order .",
    "as is defined by eq .  , our bond order @xmath0 is defined from the energy density evaluated at the lagrange point .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine a type of chemical bond that can not be well characterized by a single point between two atoms .",
    "this is quite likely to be true for chemical bonds where spatially extended @xmath8-orbitals are involved ; especially , in cases @xmath53-@xmath53 and @xmath54-@xmath54 interactions are prominent .    a possible solution to this problem is defining the bond order by integration of the energy density over some surface .",
    "the most natural choice of this surface would be a  lagrange surface \" @xcite that is constructed from a family of lines , which going out from a lagrange point ( if a lagrange surface includes a lagrange point ) .",
    "namely , we define bond order of the bond between atoms a and b as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the lagrange surface between atoms a and b. as is the cases of @xmath0 ( eq .  ) , we normalize by the value of the hydrogen molecule .    unfortunately , however , this lagrange surface is not so easy to define numerically .",
    "hence , we instead take the surface integral over the plane that includes a lagrange point and is perpendicular to the axis connecting two atoms .",
    "note that such a plane coincides with a lagrange surface in the case of homonuclear diatomic molecules .",
    "also note that in our case of * m@xmath32 * and * m@xmath51 * , the lagrange surface between the metal atoms should be very close to such a plane due to the symmetry .",
    "another thing we have to determine is the region on the plane over which we integrate the energy density .",
    "this is because if we integrate all over the plane , we may count energy density which is associated with other bonds .",
    "we avoid this possibility by integrating only in the region where the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor is perpendicular to the plane . there could be more than two disconnected regions with such a property , but , of course , we only integrate over the region including the lagrange point .",
    "this criterion for the integration region is motivated by the fact that the flow of eigenvectors connecting two atoms is considered to embody a chemical bond .",
    "let us now study the concrete cases of * m@xmath32 * and * m@xmath51*. fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_compare ] shows the cross - sections of the cr  cr bond and the mo ",
    "mo bond by the plane discussed earlier . in detail , energy density distribution and the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor",
    "are plotted on the plane that includes the lagrange point of the metal  metal bond and",
    "is perpendicular to the bond axis .",
    "the lagrange point is located at the origin , and the energy density is normalized by the value at that point .",
    "the energy density is shown by yellow color map and also by the contours . since the projection of eigenvectors on this plane is shown by black rods ,",
    "if the eigenvectors are perpendicular to the plane , they are expressed by dots .",
    "then , the regions surrounded by the blue dashed lines ( where we can not see rods ) correspond to the regions where eigenvectors are virtually perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the blue dashed lines are contours on which the perpendicular component of the eigenvector is 0.9 . as mentioned previously , to calculate the bond order",
    ", we shall integrate the energy density over the region surrounded by the blue dashed line , which contains the lagrange point .",
    "this is the region located at the central part of the figure .",
    "note that this region surrounds the contour for 0.1 of the normalized energy density ( thicker red solid line ) .",
    "therefore , if we integrate the energy density over the region , most of the energy density associated with this bond can be taken into account .    here",
    ", we report the results of the integration .",
    "@xmath57 for cr ",
    "cr is 2.92 and that for mo ",
    "mo is 3.13 . before integration , namely in terms of @xmath0 ,",
    "cr is calculated to be stronger than mo  mo but after integration , in terms of @xmath57 , cr ",
    "cr is calculated to be weaker than mo  mo , which is consistent with the mo - based bond order calculation .",
    "the relative strength measured by @xmath0 turns out to be reversed from the one measured by @xmath57 because the energy density distribution in mo  mo is broader than that of cr  cr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_compare ] ) .",
    "this is again consistent with the mo analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has concluded the spatial extension of @xmath8-orbitals of cr is less than that of mo and with earlier literature @xcite .",

    "this is consistent with the fact that these bonds do not involve spatially extended @xmath8-orbitals .",
    "we would like to end this section by examining the electronic stress tensor of the metal - metal bond .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : stresscrcr ] and [ fig : stressmomo ] .",

    "the negative eigenvalue of c@xmath27h@xmath27 is caused by the compressive stress nearby the c nuclei .",
    "in general , the stress tensor has a large negative eigenvalue in radial direction in neighborhood of a nucleus due the dominance of the attractive coulomb force . in the case of c@xmath27h@xmath27 ,",
    "the bond length is too short that the internuclear region is immersed under the atomic compressive stress @xcite .",
    "if we regard c@xmath27h@xmath30 , c@xmath27h@xmath61 and c@xmath27h@xmath27 as a series which changing from a spindle structure to a pseudo - spindle structure , the mo  mo bond in * m@xmath51 * may correspond to the stage between c@xmath27h@xmath61 and c@xmath27h@xmath27 .",
    "of course , since they have totally different shell structures , the direct comparison does not make sense .",

    "this is similar for the cr ",
    "cr bond . whether stronger cr  cr bond than that of m@xmath32 produces ( partly ) pseudo - spindle structure is a very interesting question to ask . now , final comments are in order .",
    "we have just mentioned that when considering the series which changes from a spindle structure to a pseudo - spindle structure , it is non - sense to discuss different types of atoms on equal footing because of difference in shell structures .",
    "meanwhile , we have shown that the energy density , which is dynamically well - defined quantity , is capable of showing the mo  mo bond is stronger than the cr  cr bond . then",
    ", the spindle / pseudo - spindle structure series may be discussed in a unified manner using the energy density and stress tensor . to do this ,",
    "it is also essential to clarify how the stress tensor changes as the shells pile up and its effect on chemical bonds .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the electronic structure of two types of transition metal complexes , the inverted - sandwich - type and open - lantern - type , by the electronic stress tensor .",
    "in particular , the bond order @xmath0 measured by the energy density which is defined from the electronic stress tensor has been studied and compared with the conventional mo - based bond order .",
    "we have also studied the patterns found in the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor and corresponding eigenvector field , the  spindle structure \" and  pseudo - spindle structure \" .",
    "they are both defined by a bundle of flow lines formed by the eigenvectors which connects two atoms and the former has the positive eigenvalue while the latter has the negative eigenvalue .    as for the inverted - sandwich - type complex , we have investigated v , cr , mn , and fe complexes .",
    "our bond order @xmath0 calculation has shown that relative strength of the metal - benzene bond among v , cr , and mn complexes is @xmath1 which turned out to be same as the mo - based bond order as was found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the fe complex has not been investigated in this context due to the different pattern of the lagrange points ( on which the energy density is computed to define @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is in a sense also consistent with the mo analysis because the bonding / non - bonding orbital assignment for the fe complex was rather ambiguous and not as clear as that for the other three complexes .",
    "we have also studied the eigenvector pattern of the largest eigenvalue of the stress tensor .",
    "the bond between the metal atom and c atom of benzene are characterized by the pseudo - spindle structure for all of the complexes .",
    "it was found that some of the pseudo - spindle structures were not associated with a lagrange point .    regarding the open - lantern - type complex , we have investigated cr and mo complexes . in this case , @xmath0 calculation has shown that relative strength of the metal - metal bond between cr and mo complexes is @xmath62 which is reversed order to the mo - based bond order calculated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "suspecting that @xmath0 , which measure the energy density at a single point , is not appropriate for a bond involving spatially extended @xmath8-orbitals , we have proposed a modified definition of the energy density - based bond order , @xmath57 , eq .  .",
    "this new definition measures the energy density integrated over the  lagrange surface \" between two atoms and is able to take into account spatial extent of the energy density .",
    "actually , using @xmath57 , the relative strength of cr  cr and mo  mo was calculated to be @xmath63 which is consistent with the mo - based bond order . finally , we have studied the eigenvector pattern in the regions of cr  cr and mo ",
    "mo bonds . the cr ",

    "mo has shown both positive and negative regions .",
    "it seems to be characterized by a spindle structure but also has a pseudo - spindle nature .",
    "although our study here was carried out for limited types of transition metal complexes , we were able to gain new insight into the eigenvector field pattern of the largest eigenvalue of the electronic stress tensor and the lagrange point patterns , which had not been found in our previous studies of @xmath6- or @xmath7-block compounds .",
    "we also have confirmed that our energy density - based bond order can properly describe the relative strength of chemical bonds involving @xmath8-orbitals by the surface integration",
