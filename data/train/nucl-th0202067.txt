    "pion photoproduction has provided a wealth of information about baryon resonances . during the past three or four decades ,",
    "extensive investigations have been carried out in both experiment and theory . in particular , the recent availability of high intensity electron and photon beams at jlab , elsa , mami and esrf has significantly improved the precision of pion photo- and electroproduction experiments .",
    "a large experimental database now exists , and a significant increase is expected once the current set of experiments has been analyzed .",
    "pion photoproduction has been an important source , supplementary to @xmath5 scattering experiments , for establishing most of the well - known baryon resonances , while providing information on their photo - decay amplitudes . in the search for  missing resonances \" , other meson production channels , to which these resonances might have stronger couplings ,",
    "are now being extensively studied ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apart from a few dominant states , a considerable model - dependence exists in resonance parameters extracted using phenomenological approaches to the data .",
    "this has complicated the comparison with resonance parameters derived from quark models .",
    "historically , most approaches have adopted a factorization of the meson interaction vertices , where the dynamical information is absorbed into the resonance partial - decay widths and empirical form factors .",
    "consequently , parameters for the meson - nucleon - resonance couplings and form factors have been introduced .",
    "such empirical schemes have been very important in analyses of data and the extraction of resonance signals in pion photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "a number of multipole fits , taking into account different dynamical aspects , are now underway . for instance , the unitary isobar model ( maid )  @xcite , containing born terms , 5 resonances and vector meson exchanges , succeeds in the description of data up to 1 gev .",
    "approaches adopting constraints from fixed-@xmath6 dispersion relations are being re - visited and applied to the delta region  @xcite .",
    "other approaches , using effective lagrangians for the delta resonance excitation and _ t_-channel vector - meson exchange , can also be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the said fits  @xcite , based on a parametrization of different partial wave contributions , extend the analysis up to 2 gev . with some common features but quite different model constraints",
    ", these multipole fits hope to converge to a common result and obtain , as near as possible , model - independent information on the resonance excitations .",
    "there is a clear need to treat all resonances consistently , and to understand the relation between the _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonances and _ t_-channel meson exchanges .",
    "a recently developed quark model framework@xcite , augmented by an effective lagrangian approach to reaction dynamics , provides a good starting point .",
    "the main feature of this model is the introduction of an effective chiral lagrangian for the quark - pseudoscalar - meson coupling in a constituent quark model . unlike most previous quark models , which were generally based on factorization of the strong interaction vertices ,",
    "the pion is treated as an elementary particle . as a result",
    ", one can explicitly calculate the tree level diagrams for pion production reactions . here",
    ", the quark model wavefunctions for the nucleons and baryon resonances provide a form factor for each interaction vertex , and all the _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonances can be consistently included .",
    "this model has the advantage of being able to describe a large photoproduction database , employing only a very limited number of parameters within a microscopic framework . applications of this model to the @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite meson photoproduction have been quite successful , and this has motivated our study of the very extensive pion photoproduction database .    the quark model s well - known underestimation of the electromagnetic ( em ) transition amplitude for the delta resonance makes this resonance region particularly interesting . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the  bare \" @xmath9 vertex could be more directly related to the quantity given by the quark model derivation of the delta em transition .",
    "a direct examination of the delta excitation in @xmath10 might shed some light on this question .",
    "this paper presents both quantitative and qualitative investigations of pion photoproduction .",
    "the challenge to describe the @xmath11 resonance excitation with explicit quark and gluon degrees of freedom is by no means trivial , since the correct off - shell behavior of those intermediate resonances is required .",
    "also , a clear definition of the nucleon born terms , associated with the gauge invariance requirement , is essential for this effective theory . in this study , we concentrate on the energy region corresponding to @xmath12 700 mev , where the role played by the born terms   and the low - lying resonances , in particular the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , can be clarified .",
    "qualitative tests have been made in order to compare this model to a typical isobaric approach .",
    "here we consider the role played by the _ t_-channel vector meson exchanges in isobaric models , and the effect of neglecting the _ u_-channel resonance contributions .    in section",
    "ii , we outline the formalism aspects of our approach . in section iii , results for cross sections and single polarization asymmetries for the four charge channels , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 will be presented .",
    "the role of the _ t_-channel vector meson exchange will also be discussed .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "before we begin a detailed analysis , a brief review of this model is necessary .      for pion photoproduction , the low energy theorem ( let ) provides a crucial test near threshold . as shown in previous investigation by li  @xcite , to recover the let",
    ", one has to rely on the low energy qcd lagrangian which keeps the meson - baryon interaction invariant under the chiral transformation . combining the low energy qcd lagrangian with the quark model",
    ", we introduce the quark - meson interaction through the effective lagrangian  @xcite : @xmath16\\psi + \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot,\\ ] ] where the vector and axial currents are @xmath17 and the chiral transformation is , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the decay constant of the meson .",

    "thus , the lagrangian in eq .",

    "@xcite , the operators for the pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling have the same leading order expression at quark tree level .",

    "we suggest that the tree level calculation , based on the quark model , may have included the main ingredients , ( e.g. relative signs and form factors ) , even though its description of the nucleon pole and delta resonance is very simple .",
    "an interesting question arising in this work is the role played by the _",

    "it is worth noting that similar structures as found in @xmath156 ( the  dip \" and  spike \" ) are also present here , and due to the same mechanism .      in comparison with the charged pion production ,",
    "the neutral - pion channels are relatively simple in this model .",

    "so far , there are only sparse data available for this channel .    the above results for the cross section and single polarization asymmetries suggest an overall quantitative agreement with the data from threshold to the first resonance region , while qualitatively , the data up to the second resonance region can be explained .",
    "the lack of quantitative agreement above the delta resonance region was expected , given that only a minimum number of free parameters are used here . however , by using only a minimal model , it has been easier to identify key ingredients responsible for those trends we _ do _ reproduce .",
    "as mentioned previously , in @xmath74 photoproduction , the most prominent features seen in the cross section are forward peaking and the dip at @xmath157 , which is attributed to the born terms .",
    "our results also reproduce this feature . some new ingredients appearing in this approach concern the roles played by the born terms and the delta resonance , and the influence of their associated form factors .",
    "as found in previous studies , the born terms deviate significantly from the experimental data at intermediate and backward angles as photon energies increase to the gev level .",
    "the cross section due to born terms alone is much larger than the data suggest .",
    "one possible explanation is that the born terms are cancelled by resonance contributions away from the forward peak .",
    "as discussed by barbour , malone and moorhouse in a fixed-@xmath6 dispersion relation  @xcite , the real parts of the resonance amplitudes tend to cancel the born terms at @xmath158 , while the region @xmath159 is slightly enhanced by low - lying resonance contributions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:(13 ) ] , we illustrate the results for the born terms and born terms plus delta excitation , with and without the quark model form factors , respectively",
    ". clearly , form factors are vital in the quark - model description , though no free parameters have been introduced . comparing the full result to one in which the form factors are switched off ,",
    "we see potential problems for those who compare quark - model results directly to fits ( such as said and maid ) which do not introduce form factors .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would be the consideration of forward cross sections at higher energies , where the influence of form factors is nebulous  @xcite .",
    "to end this section , we present a comparison of energy evolution of the born terms plus delta helicity amplitudes calculated by this model with a said analysis@xcite .",
    "the four independent helicity amplitudes are calculated following the convention of ref .",

    ", only @xmath166 has non - zero values , while all the other elements vanish . in the backward direction ,",
    "the non - vanishing element is @xmath167 .",
    "compared with the said analysis , an overall agreement is obtained up to 500 mev .      a long - standing question concerns the role played by vector - meson exchange in low - energy pion photoproduction . according to the duality argument  @xcite , the introduction of vector meson exchanges , along with a complete set of _",
    "s_-channel resonances , might result in double counting . in practice ,",
    "a systematic inclusion of all _ s_-channel resonances at the hadronic level is not available .",
    "empirically , _",
    "t_-channel vector - meson exchange may account for incomplete _",
    "s_-channel resonance contributions , which however makes the duality hypothesis more ambiguous .",
    "given the results presented in the previous subsections , the quark model framework , with an effective lagrangian , could address this question in pion photoproduction from a more fundamental level .",
    "as seen in the cross sections for @xmath74 production up to 700 mev , forward peaking above the delta resonance has been successfully sustained up to 500 mev .",
    "this could reasonably illustrate that the effective lagrangian has been sufficient to describe the data over the first resonance region . in order to consider the effect of possible double counting between the _ t_-channel vector meson exchange and _ s_- and _ u_-channel resonances , we compare models including various subsets of these diagrams .",
    "our purpose is to clarify whether the behavior of those higher excited states ( terms ) would be similar to the inclusion of vector meson exchange , particularly to compare with an ` isobaric ' model , where the _ u_-channel resonance contributions are neglected .",
    "we shall introduce the following effective lagrangians for vector - meson exchange : @xmath168 for @xmath169 coupling and @xmath170 for the quark - vector - meson ( @xmath171-@xmath172 ) coupling ; @xmath173 and @xmath171 denote the photon and vector meson ; @xmath25 denotes the pion field and @xmath20 ( @xmath174 ) denotes the quark ( antiquark ) field ; @xmath175 and @xmath176 are coupling constants .",
