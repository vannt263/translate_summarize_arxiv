    "josephson junctions are a potent tool for the investigation of iron pnictide superconductors . in our investigations on iron pnictide superconductors we prepared planar josephson junctions using a sputtered insulating layer as barrier . up to now different works for josephson junctions with single crystals , @xcite for bi - crystal grain boundary junctions @xcite and edge - type junctions @xcite as well as for planar junctions",
    "@xcite were published .",
    "the josephson junctions presented therein used natural or engineered interfaces as well as normal metal layers as barrier , but up to now , no work with a deposited insulating barrier has been published .",
    "additionally planar homo junctions with ferromagnetic barrier layers are in progress.@xcite the behavior of a josephson junction is most sensitive in the barrier properties e.g. its transparency .",
    "our early experiments resulted in low resistance josephson junctions with gold barriers showing an @xmath0-product of about 18@xmath3v , @xcite which is much too low for possible applications like squids .",
    "other works mentioned above and summarized in ref",
    ".   showed @xmath0-products of similar magnitude for different kinds of josephson junctions with iron pnictides and various barriers . only for junctions with a native barrier",
    "@xmath0-products up to 300@xmath3v could be observed @xcite .",
    "+ one of the most famous phase - sensitive tests for the expected s@xmath4-symmetry of iron pnictides from parker and mazin @xcite requires two distinct josephson junctions with different transparencies .",
    "thus , the transport of each junction will be dominated by the opposite charge carrier type so they will form a @xmath5-squid . hence , it is obvious to reach the idea by the combination of two junctions with a metal - like ( high transparency ) and insulating ( low transparency ) barrier , respectively . + additionally , previous junctions with gold barriers showed non - ideal features like high excess currents , asymmetric @xmath6-@xmath7 characteristics and non - constant background in microwave dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite by changing the barrier from normal conducting gold to insulating titanium oxide , an increase of the @xmath0-products of our planar junctions is highly expected and a reduction of these non - ideal effects seems to be possible .",
    "+ another reason to introduce insulating barriers would be their use in quasi - particle spectroscopy on iron - pnictides . in low resistance junctions an additional series resistance from the electrodes can occur , when the measurement is done in the range of the transition temperature or with currents above @xmath8 of the film or electrode , respectively .",
    "@xcite this spreading resistance can dramatically disturb the observed conductance spectra or at least impedes their normalization necessary for modeling within the btk - theory .",
    "@xcite the effect of spreading resistance was observed in former junctions @xcite as well as in point contact andreev reflection ( pcar ) studies on pnictides . @xcite even if its possible to recalculate the real spectra with a semi - empiric model by characterization of the used electrodes , @xcite this means more expenditure and results only in a rough estimation . by using insulating barriers",
    ", it should be possible to produce junctions with much higher resistances . thus spreading resistances from the electrodes",
    "should be negligible in these junctions .",
    "+ for conventional superconductors titanium oxide barriers have been used to prepare josephson or sin - junctions . @xcite thus prior to the process on pnictide thin films , we used the barriers on junctions with two conventional superconductors lead and niobium , respectively , to test the barrier properties with well known materials .",
    "for the preparation of these nb\\tio@xmath9\\pb junctions we use a sio@xmath1 substrate with an e - beam evaporated niobium layer of 500 nm thickness . to prepare the junction area and the bonding pads of the nb electrode we use a photo - lithography mask and subsequently ion beam etching ( ibe ) to remove material from the nb surface of 30 nm depth . after this",
    "we deposit sio@xmath1 by reactive sputtering with a thickness of 250 nm .",
    "the next step is the preparation of our counter electrode bonding pads with another photo - lithographic mask . for the pads we use a bi - layer system of titanium and gold with a thickness of 40 nm and 90 nm , respectively .",
    "the titanium is very adhesive on the sputtered sio@xmath1 and gold acts very well as electrical and mechanical contact for future gold wire bonding .",
    "both materials are sputtered _ in - situ _ at a pressure of 2pa in argon atmosphere and with a power of 50w . after this",
    "we apply a photo - lithographic mask on the sample to deposit the barrier layer of oxidized ti and the counter electrode layers of pb and in . for the preparation of the barrier layer we clean up the nb surface in the junction area from any oxides by removing 15 nm of the surface via ibe .",
    "thereafter the titanium is deposited _ in - situ _ on the clean surface in argon atmosphere at a pressure of 4pa and a sputtering power of 30w at a deposition rate of 2nm / min .",
    "thus we have good control of the barrier thickness .",
    "we heat the sample in air up to 80c for 20min to get a fast and controlled oxidation of the titanium . for the deposition of the counter electrode we use vacuum evaporation of lead with a layer thickness of 350 nm and followed by an indium protective layer with a thickness of 50 nm . a 3d - sketch and the corresponding cross - section of this junction",

    "now we use a separate photo - lithographic mask , which covers the whole sample except an area including each junction window plus some tolerance area around . via ibe the covering gold thickness is reduced to nominally 1 nm . the reason for that is to reduce the influence of gold maximally , but not etch into the superconducting layer to avoid possible destruction of the superconductivity on the surface .",

    "+ in this work we will present results and show differences of samples with 1.5 nm and 2.0 nm of sputtered and oxidized titanium . between these values there seems to be the transition from metal like to insulating behavior of the barrier . for barriers thinner than 1.0 nm we can not exclude short cuts due to incomplete covering of the superconducting surface , while thicknesses above 3.5 nm result in resistances in the order of m@xmath13 .",

    "fig : v - i ] it shows no josephson effect but more tunnel - like behavior .",
    "this is supported by the conductance spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_c4 ] .",
    "it can be seen , that there is no central peak but a clear dip down to 80percent of the normal state value .",
    "additionally there are is only a small and noisy rise of the conductance beside the central dip . such rise should be expected from energy dependence of the superconducting density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this behavior can be explained by two facts .",
    "firstly , a high dynes - parameter @xmath39 , which includes scattering processes into the btk - model @xcite and lowers features compared to pure ballistic junctions .",
    "secondly , spin - polarization of the pnictide should be taken into account .",
    "in such an extended btk - model , the dos side peaks can be lowered or vanish completely for present spin - polarization for any type of junction barrier .",
    "@xcite + the critical thickness of the barrier for junctions with a pnictide base electrode is about 1 nm lower than for junctions with the niobium base electrode .",
    "the possible reason for this is the lower roughness of the ba-122 surface . while ba-122 is an epitaxially grown thin film with nearly atomic flat surface , the niobium electrode is prepared from an e - beam evaporated layer on a silicon wafer .",
    "thus the niobium is amorphous with higher surface roughness than the ba-122 thin film .",
    "to summarize , we used tio@xmath9 barriers firstly on junctions with conventional metal superconductors and showed that we were able to switch between josephson effect and tunnel - like behavior by increasing the thickness of the barrier .",
    "subsequently , we transferred the technology to junctions with iron pnictide base electrode and pb counter electrode . for a double barrier with very thin au and 1.5 nm tio@xmath9 we could increase the resulted @xmath0-product of sns-like josephson junctions by at least a factor of 5 compared to former junctions with a pure 5 nm gold barrier .",
    "additionally , we are able to prepare high resistant sis or sins-like junctions for tunneling spectroscopy by further increasing the barrier thickness . with this",
    "first junctions thus we were able to increase the properties and the possibilities of hybrid junctions with a pnictide electrode .",
