    "the isotropic distribution of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) in the sky and their number distribution as function of intensity , measured with the batse instrument aboard the compton gamma ray observatory , provided the first observational evidence that gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) originate at large cosmological distances ( meegan et al .",
    "moreover , the rapid variation of their light curves ( bahat et al .",
    "1992 ) indicated that their huge energy is emitted from a very small volume . in the original fireball ( fb )",
    "model of grbs ( e.g. paczynski  1986 ; goodman  1986 ; rees & mszros  1992 ) the emission was spherically symmetric .",
    "the implied isotropic energy release of grbs in @xmath0-rays often exceeded @xmath1 , creating an ` energy crisis ' .",
    "indeed , such a mighty , abrupt , compact , and @xmath0-ray - efficient source was unforeseen .",
    "a simple solution to this puzzle was suggested by shaviv and dar ( 1995 ) : the @xmath0-ray emission is narrowly collimated by the relativistic motion of their _ jetted _ source , which is seen when it points closely enough to the observer . in this view , grbs are not produced by fireballs , but by inverse compton scattering of light by highly relativistic jets of ordinary matter , ejected in violent stellar processes such as supernova explosions , mergers of neutron stars ( paczynski  1986 ; goodman , dar & nussinov  1987 ; dar et al .",
    "1992 ) , or the direct collapse of massive stars to black holes without a supernova ( woosley 1993 ) .    the sky localization of grbs by bepposax ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) led to the discovery ( groot et al .",
    "1997 ; van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ) of their optical afterglows ( ags ) and their host galaxies ( sahu et al .",
    "1997 ) which were used to extract their cosmological redshifts ( metzger et al .",
    "the ags seemed to follow an achromatic power - law decline , as expected from a highly relativistic expanding fireball that drives a blast wave into the circumburst environment ( e.g. , mszros & rees  1997 ) .",
    "this prediction of the spherical fireball model ( see e.g. , piran  1999 ) being independent of the assumption of spherical symmetry , it was also argued that the ags , like the grbs themselves , are produced by narrowly collimated jets ( dar  1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "the concept of jets was incorporated into the fb model by the substitution of its spherical shells by conical sections thereof , the mechanism for the @xmath0-ray emission still being synchrotron radiation from shock - accelerated @xmath2 pairs in a baryon - poor material ( see , e.g.  piran  1999 ,  2000 ; mszros  2002 and references therein ) , in spite of the difficulties that such a radiation mechanism encounters ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "an elegant and simple way to distinguish between a conical jet and a spherical fireball was suggested by rhoads ( 1997 ) : the ag of a decelerating conical jet will show an achromatic steepening a _ jet break_ in its power - law decline when the relativistic beaming angle of its radiation becomes larger than the opening angle of the jet .",
    "soon afterwards , better sampled data on the optical afterglow of grbs showed the existence of what appeared to be such achromatic jet breaks ( harrison et al .",
    "1999 ; stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the spherical fb model was modified into a _ collimated fireball _ model ( e.g.  piran , sari & halpern  1999 ) . in this model grb pulses are produced by synchrotron radiation from the collision between conical sections of shells .",
    "the collision of the ensemble of shells with the interstellar matter ( ism ) generates the ag by synchrotron radiation from the forward shock propagating in the ism , and/or from the backwards shock within the merged shells .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) and sari , piran and halpern ( 1999 ) derived a relation between the opening angle of the conical jet and the time of the jet break . this relation has been applied extensively to the pre - swift data to infer the opening angle of the conical jet and to determine the ` true ' energy of grbs , posited to be an approximate standard candle ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) .    since the launch of swift the above generally - accepted ` standard ' paradigm has been challenged , due to the absence of breaks in the ags of many grbs ( panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows and racusin 2006 ) , to the chromatic behaviour of the ag of other grbs having the alleged ` jet break ' ( stanek et al .  1999 , harrison et al .  1999 ) , and to the failure of the frail relation ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) in many swift grbs ( kocevski & butler  2007 ) . in the fireball model ,",
    "the jet breaks need not be sharp ; they are often parametrized with a varying smoothness ( stanek et al .",
    "1999 ) . allowing for such breaks , covino et al .",
    "( 2006 ) could not identify a swift grb with a fully achromatic break .",
    "liang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have extended this study , and analyzed the swift x - ray data for the 179 grbs detected between january 2005 and january 2007 and the optical ags of 57 pre- and post - swift grbs .",
    "they found that not a single burst satisfies all the criteria of a jet break .",
    "this brings us fully into the question of the nature and properties of the jets responsible for grbs and their ags and , more specifically in this paper , to the understanding of ` breaks ' and ` missing breaks ' .",
    "an alternative to the fireball scenario is offered by the ` cannonball ' ( cb ) model of grbs [ dar & de rjula  2000a , 2004 , hereafter dd2000a , 2004 ; dado , dar & de rjula ( hereafter ddd )  2002 ; for a recent review see de rjula  2007 ] . in this model _ long - duration _ grbs and their ags are produced by bipolar jets of cbs ( shaviv & dar  1995 ; dar & plaga  1999 ) , ejected in  _ ordinary core - collapse _ supernova ( sn ) explosions as matter is accreted onto the newly - formed compact object ( de rjula 1987 ) .",
    "the ` cannon - balls ' are made of _ ordinary - matter plasma_. the @xmath0-rays of a single pulse of a grb are produced as a cb coasts through the sn _ glory _ the initial sn light , scattered away from the radial direction by the ` wind ' : the ejecta puffed by the progenitor star in a succession of pre - sn flares .",
    "the electrons enclosed in the cb raise the glory s photons to grb energies by _ inverse compton scattering ( ics)_. as a cb coasts through the glory , the distribution of the glory s light becomes increasingly radial and its density decreases rapidly .",
    "consequently , the energy of the up - scattered photons is continuously shifted to lower energies and their number decreases swiftly , resulting in a fast softening and decline of the prompt emission ( dd2004 , 2007a , b ) . in the cb model , the ag of a grb is due to _ synchrotron radiation ( sr ) _ from swept - in ism electrons spiraling in the cb s enclosed turbulent magnetic field , generated by the intercepted ism nuclei and electrons ( ddd2002 ) . at x - ray energies ,",
    "the sr afterglow begins to dominate the ics prompt emission only during the fast - decline phase of the latter ( ddd2006 ) .    in the cb model , the _ beau rle _ in the understanding of grbs",
    "is played by the doppler factor , @xmath3 , relating times , energies and fluxes in a cb s rest system to those in the observer s system .",
    "its form in terms of the observer s angle @xmath4 ( relative to the cb s direction of motion ) and the time - dependent lorentz factor , @xmath5 , of a cb , is : @xmath6}\\approx { 2\\ , \\gamma(t)\\over 1+[\\gamma(t)\\ , \\theta]^2}\\ ; , \\label{delta}\\ ] ] where the approximation is excellent for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath5 with time , as a cb encounters the particles of the ism , is calculable on grounds of energy - momentum conservation ( ddd2002 , dar & de rjula 2006 , thereafter dd2006 ) .",
    "the energy - integrated energy flux of the ag of a grb , is @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 . consider a cb that is observed almost on axis ,",
    "so that @xmath11 : the observer is _ ab initio _ within the opening cone of the relativistically beamed radiation .",
    "as @xmath5 decreases , @xmath3 monotonically decreases and so does the observed ag . consider the same cb , viewed by an observer at a much larger angle , so that @xmath12 is ` a few ' . as @xmath5 decreases ,",
    "@xmath3 in eq .  ( [ delta ] )",
    "_ increases _ , reflecting the fact that the characteristic opening angle of the radiation , @xmath13 , is reaching the observer s direction . past the point @xmath14 , the decrease of @xmath3 is monotonic , as in the first case we considered .",
    "the ag radiation parallels again the behaviour of @xmath3 . for observers of the same grb from different angles , as @xmath4 increases at fixed @xmath5 , the ag s flux decreases .",
    "all these simple facts , supported by the corresponding explicit derivations , are reflected in fig .",
    "[ f1]a , which we have copied from ddd2002 , as it foretells the progressive variety of ag shapes to be studied here .    there is more to fig .",
    "[ f1]a than what we said .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath5 of a cb only begins to change significantly , in a calculable manner , when the increase in its mass induced by the energy influx of the swept - in ism particles becomes comparable to the cb s initial mass .",
    "this happens , as we shall review , at a time @xmath15/\\gamma_0 ^ 3 $ ] . at fixed @xmath5 , as reflected in fig .",
    "[ f1]a , a larger @xmath4 entails a larger @xmath16 .",
    "this achromatic ` deceleration bend ' at @xmath17 , we believe , was often interpreted in fb models as a putative jet break .",
    "naturally , the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 of a given cb also affect the properties of its prompt ics - dominated radiation ( we are presenting this introductory discussion as if there was a single cb generating the prompt and ag radiations , a simplification to be undone when needed ) . in the cb model",
    "the ics - dictated @xmath20 dependences of a cb s isotropic energy , peak energy and peak luminosity are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( dd2000b ) .",
    "the conditions for these quantities to be relatively large ( a relatively small @xmath4 or a large @xmath18 ) are the ones leading to a luminous ag with a small @xmath16 .",
    "the basis for one of these expected correlations , studied before in detail in ddd2007c , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1]b .",
    "if the deceleration bend at time @xmath16 takes place _ after _ the fast - decline phase of the prompt emission , it is observable , and the unabsorbed x - ray light curve is canonical ( ddd2002 ) . in these cases , there is a ` break ' .",
    "if @xmath16 takes place earlier , it is hidden under the prompt emission , and only the tail of the canonical behaviour , namely the ` late ' power - law decline of the unabsorbed synchrotron afterglow , is observable . in these cases ,",
    "the break is missing . the transition from long - plateau , clearly ` broken ' ags , to power - law like ` unbroken ' ags",
    "should be anticorrelated with the trend from under-`energetic ' to over - energetic grbs .    in the cb model the late - time spectral energy density @xmath24 of the x - ray and optical ag tends to a time and energy - dependence @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the spectral index of the electrons accelerated within a cb and cooled by the emission of the very sr seen as the ag .",
    "a prediction that we have not emphasized before is that the temporal power decline should be , grb by grb , half a unit steeper than the spectral decline .    in ddd2006 , 2007a",
    "we have demonstrated that the most common light curves of the x - ray ag of grbs are well described by the cb model .",
    "we have also explained there the various origins of the chromatic behaviours of ags . in ddd2007b",
    "we have focused on the fast decline phase of the prompt emission and we have demonstrated that the rapid spectral evolution observed during this phase is also as expected in the cb model . in ddd2007c",
    "we have shown , for large ensembles of grbs , how the observed correlations between @xmath27 , @xmath28 [ dar & de rjula 2000b ( dd2000b ) , amati et al .",
    "2002 ] , @xmath29 , and other prompt observables ( pulse rise - time , lag - time and variability ) follow mainly from the same simple geometrical considerations that we have reviewed above on the case - by - case variability of the doppler factor . in the cb model ,",
    "xrfs are simply grbs seen at relatively large @xmath4 ( ddd2004a ) , even the particularly interesting xrf 060218 is in no way exceptional ( ddd2007a ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the shape of the light curves of the x - ray afterglow of grbs , with and without breaks , measured with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) aboard swift .",
    "we show that the shapes of the x - ray light curves of grbs and xrfs predicted in fig .",
    "[ f1]a , and the correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath27 illustrated fig .",
    "[ f1]b ( and the consequent apparent presence or absence of breaks in the ag ) agree with the cb - model s expectations .",
    "we also analize the @xmath30 correlation on the same light .",
    "finally , we investigate the relation between the temporal power - law index of the post - break decline and the photon spectral index , reaching satisfactory results .",
    "to do all this , we investigate 16 grbs chosen to reflect the full span of the question of the presence or absence of breaks .",
    "the selected grbs range from the faintest known grb ( 980425 , of supernova - association fame ) , which also has the most pronounced plateau and the latest break time , to the brightest swift grb ( 061007 ) , with the most luminous and longest - observed unbroken power - law x - ray ag .",
    "in the cb model , the mechanism for the emission of the prompt radiation of grbs and xrfs is inverse compton scattering .",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt phase , including its fast decline , are summarized in a ` master formula ' ( dd2004 ) that we have already contrasted with swift data ( ddd2006 , 2007a , b , c , d ) .",
    "we shall not repeat it here as our emphasis in the current study is on breaks in the x - ray light curves of grb afterglows though we shall use it to describe the fading of the prompt emission until the take - over by the synchrotron - ag emission , and the occasional late x - ray flares .",
    "neither do we discuss here the optical ags ( ddd2007a ) .",
    "the extinction in the optical- and , more so , in the radio- domain ( within the cbs , in the circumburst environment , in the ism of the host galaxy and ours , and in the intergalactic medium ) are difficult to model as reliably as the x - ray extinction .",
    "we shall see once again that the x - ray light curves ( corrected for extinction ) carry clear and direct information on the radiation mechanisms that dominate the prompt emission and the ag phase ( ics and sr , respectively , in the cb model ) .    during the initial phase of @xmath0-ray emission in a grb ,",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath0 of a cb stays put at its initial value @xmath31 , for the deceleration induced by the interactions with the ism has not yet had a significant effect .",
    "the doppler factor by which the light emitted by a cb is boosted in energy is given by eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "since the emitted light is forward - collimated into a cone of characteristic opening angle @xmath32 , the boosted energetic radiation is easiest to detect for @xmath33 .",
    "thus , typically , @xmath34 .    as a cb ploughs through the ism , fully ionized by the preceding @xmath0 radiation , it gathers and scatters the ism ions , mainly protons .",
    "these encounters are ` collisionless ' since , at about the time it becomes transparent to radiation , a cb also becomes ` transparent ' to hadronic interactions . as a consequence of momentum conservation ,",
    "the scattered and re - emitted protons inevitably exert an inwards ` pressure ' on the cb .",
    "we have assumed that the main effect of this pressure is to slow the cb s expansion , posited to be relativistic at the emission time . in the approximation of isotropic re - emission in the cb s rest frame and a constant ism density @xmath35 ,",
    "one then finds that , typically within minutes of observer s time @xmath36 , a cb reaches a roughly ` coasting ' radius , @xmath37 , which increases slowly until the cb finally stops and blows up ( dd2006 ) . up to the end of the coasting phase , and in a constant density ism , @xmath5 obeys ( ddd2002 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 if the ism particles re - emitted fast by the cb are a small fraction of the flux of the intercepted ones . in the opposite limit , @xmath40 . in the cb model of cosmic rays ( dd2006 ) ,",
    "the observed spectrum strongly favours @xmath39 , used here in our fits .",
    "we have also concluded from previous analysis of swift x - ray data that @xmath41 is the right choice .    as indicated by first - principle calculations of the relativistic merger of two plasmas ( frederiksen et al .",
    "2004 ) , the ism ions continuously impinging on a cb generate within it turbulent magnetic fields , which we assume to be in approximate energy equipartition with the energy of the intercepted ism , @xmath42 . in this field ,",

    "a virtue of astrophysical x - ray data is that , in many instances and relative to lower - frequency bands , the corrections for attenuation are simpler and more reliable .",
    "the strength of swift in dealing with transient phenomena is , as the satellite s name reflects , the prompt start of its data - taking after an alert .",
    "this has made the swift results an excellent testing ground for theories of grbs and xrfs .",
    "in particular , the ability to monitor the x - ray flux over a very wide range of times has provided decisive tests of the theoretical predictions .",
    "filling the pre - swift gap in the data between ` prompt ' and ` afterglow ' radiations has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for them . in the cb model",
    "they are different : inverse compton scattering and synchrotron radiation , respectively .",
    "we have previously argued that the strong case for an ics origin of the ` prompt ' radiation ( dd2004 ) has been reconfirmed by the analysis of the swift x - ray flares , and the fast decay of the prompt signals ( ddd2007b ) . in this respect",
    "the study of x - ray and optical data is also particularly meaningful ( ddd2007a ) . the observed correlations between prompt observables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and pulse rise - time , lag - time and variability also agree with the cb - model ( see ddd2007c and references therein ) .",
    "these correlations follow from the same simple considerations , that we have emphasized in this paper , on the dependence of the cited prompt observables on the lorentz and doppler factors of the radiation emitted by a quasi - point - like relativistically moving source .    the cb - model s expectations for the interplay between ics and sr",
    "were confirmed by the analysis of the ` canonical ' shape of many swift x - ray light curves ( ddd2007a ) .",
    "the extreme canonical case is still grb 980425 , shown in fig .",
    "( [ f2]a ) .",
    "the trend of the ` hardness ratios ' reflecting the spectral behaviour , and the spectral index itself , also corroborate the expected transitional behaviour ( ddd2007b ) , as the dominant mechanism evolves from ics to sr .    in this paper",
    "we have shown in detail how the variety of x - ray ag shapes , with and without ` breaks ' , is also to be expected from a decelerating jet of effectively pointlike cannonballs , as in fig .",
    "( [ f1]a ) . that the ag emission mechanism is sr from cbs slowing down in the way approximated by eq .",
    "( [ deceleration ] ) is confirmed by the detailed frequency and time - dependences of eq .",
    "( [ fnu ] ) for the spectral energy density .",
    "we have presented a study of the correlation between the synchrotron ags @xmath36- and @xmath50- dependences , specified in the x - ray domain by eq .",
    "( [ fnux ] ) .",
    "this results in a relation between the ags spectral index @xmath88 , and the index @xmath26 appearing in their time dependence , a very simple relation at the late times at which the time dependence is also a power - law , see eq .",
    "( [ asymptotic ] ) .",
    "the prediction is tested in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] .    in the cb model ,",
    "the understanding of ags with breaks or no breaks turns out to be clear : the ` missing ' sr breaks are hiding under the prompt ics radiation , or occur too early to be seen .",
    "this sounds like a trivial and model - independent excuse .",
    "it is not .",
    "it is supported by our case - by - case analysis of ag shapes . moreover ,",
    "a crucial ingredient the angle of observation of the jet , compared to the beaming angle of its doppler - boosted radiation is validated by the correlations , e.g.  the luminous ags are the ones with early or even undetectable breaks , as in fig .",
    "[ f1]a , and as in many of the examples we discussed here ( the correlation between @xmath16 and the energy in the x - ray ag was studied in ddd2007d ) .",
    "our conclusions are also supported by the correlations between the cbs deceleration - bend ` break - times ' , @xmath16 ( in the synchrotron ags ) , and the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( in the prompt compton signal ) .",
    "these correlations , shown in figs .  [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] ,",
    "reconfirm the consistency of the overall picture .",
    "we have given no comment in the conclusions to our fits to the grbs and xrfs that we have studied .",
    "this is because the point we would like to make is _ not _ that the cb model can be used to fit the data very well .",
    "the main issue , in our view , is _ how _ a model , preferably in a predictive manner and in terms of very few concrete concepts like its radiation mechanisms , the aperture of its jets and the angle from which they are viewed can be used to understand the ensemble of long - duration grbs , and xrfs .",
    "after all , phenomena that require ever - increasingly complex explanations are of limited scientific interest .",
