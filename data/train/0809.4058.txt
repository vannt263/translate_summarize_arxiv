    "research in mimo radar has been growing as evidenced by an increasing body of literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "generally speaking , mimo radar systems employ multiple antennas to transmit multiple waveforms and engage in joint processing of the received echoes from the target .",
    "two main mimo radar architectures have evolved : with colocated antennas and with distributed antennas .",
    "mimo  radar with colocated antennas makes use of waveform diversity @xcite , while mimo radar with distributed antenna takes advantage of the spatial diversity supported by the system configuration @xcite .",
    "mimo radar systems have been shown to offer considerable advantages over traditional radars in various aspects of radar operation such as the detection of slow moving targets @xcite , the ability to identify and separate multiple targets @xcite , and in the estimation of target parameters such as direction - of - arrival ( doa ) @xcite , and range - based target localization @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite studies target localization with mimo radar systems utilizing sensors distributed over a wide area .",
    "conventional localization techniques include time - of - arrival ( toa ) , time - difference - of - arrival ( tdoa ) , and direction - of - arrival ( doa ) based schemes .",
    "mimo radar system with colocated antenna can perform doa estimation of targets in the far - field , in which case , the received signal has a planar wavefront . in this class of systems",
    ", extensive research has focused on waveform optimization . in @xcite the signal vector transmitted by a mimo radar system is designed to minimize the cross - correlation of the signals bounced from various targets to improve the parameter estimation accuracy in multiple target schemes .",
    "some of the waveform optimization techniques suggested in @xcite are based on the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) matrix @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the crlb is known to provide a tight bound on parameter estimation for high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "several design criteria are considered , such as minimizing the trace , determinant , and the largest eigenvalue of the crlb matrix , concluding that minimizing the trace of the crlb gives a good overall performance in terms of lowering the crlb . in @xcite , a crlb evaluation of the achievable angular accuracy",
    "is derived for linear arrays with orthogonal signals .",
    "the use of orthogonal signals is shown to provide better accuracy than correlated signals . for low snr scenarios ,",
    "the barankin bound is derived in @xcite , demonstrating that the use of orthogonal signals results in a lower snr threshold for transitioning into the region of higher estimation error .",
    "mimo radar systems with widely spread antennas take advantage of the geographical spread of the deployed sensors .",
    "the multiple propagation paths , created by the transmitted waveforms and echoes from scatterers in their paths support target localization through either direct or indirect multilateration . with direct multilateration ,",
    "the observations collected by the sensors are jointly processed to produce the localization estimate . with indirect multilateration ,",
    "the toas are estimated first , and the localization is subsequently estimated from the toas . the observations and processing can also be classified as either non - coherent or coherent .",
    "the distinction between the two modes relies on the need for mere time synchronization between the transmitting and receiving radars in the non - coherent case , versus the need for both time and phase synchronization in the coherent case .",
    "note that our coherent / non - coherent terminology is limited to the processing for localization .",
    "thus , a transmitted signal may have in - phase and quadrature components , yet the localization processing is non - coherent if it utilizes only information in the signal envelope . in the sequel , we evaluate the performance of localization utilizing both coherent and non - coherent processing .",
    "mimo radar systems belongs to the class of active localization systems , where the signal usually travels a round trip , i.e. the signal transmitted by one sensor in a radar system is reflected by the target and measured by the same or a different sensor .",
    "traditional single - antenna radar systems , performing active range - based measurements , are well known in literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the target range is computed from the time it takes for the transmitted signal to get to the target plus the travelling time of the reflected signal back to the sensor .",
    "the range estimation accuracy is directly proportional to the mean squared error ( mse ) of the time delay estimation and is shown to be inversely proportional to the signal effective bandwidth @xcite . a first study of the localization accuracy capability of mimo radar systems is provided in @xcite , where the fisher information matrix ( fim ) is derived for the case of orthogonal signals with coherent processing and widely separated antennas .",
    "the crlb is analyzed numerically , pointing out the dependency of the accuracy on the signal carrier frequency in the coherent case , and its reliance on the relative locations of the target and sensors . in @xcite , it is observed that the crlb is a function of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors , however an analytical relation is not developed .",
    "the high accuracy capability of coherent processing is illustrated by the use of the ambiguity function ( af ) .",
    "active range - based target localization techniques are also used in multistatic radar systems , proposed in @xcite .",
    "the toa of a signal transmitted by a single transmit radar , reflected by the target and received at multiple receive antennas is used in the localization process .",
    "it is observed that increasing the number of sensors improves localization performance , yet an exact relation is not specified .",
    "this paper addresses deficiencies in the literature by obtaining closed - form expressions of the crlb for both coherent and non - coherent cases .",
    "geolocation techniques has been the subject of extensive research .",
    "geolocation belongs to the class of passive localization systems , where the signal travels one - way .",
    "since these passive measurement systems employ multiple sensors , further evaluation of existing results for geolocation systems might provide insightful for the active case . in wireless communication ,",
    "passive measurements are used by multiple base stations for localization of a radiating mobile phone .",
    "the localization accuracy performance is evaluated in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the localization accuracy is inversely proportional to the signal effective bandwidth as it does in the active localization case . moreover ,",
    "the accuracy estimation is shown to be dependent on the sensors / base stations locations . in navigation systems ,",
    "the target makes use of time synchronized transmission from multiple global positioning systems ( gps ) to establish its location . in @xcite ,",
    "the relation between the transmitting sensors location and the target localization performance is analyzed .",
    "gdop plots are used to demonstrate the dependency of the attainable accuracy on the location of the gps systems with respect to the target . in an optimal setting of the gps systems relative to the target position",
    ", the best achievable accuracy is shown to be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of participating gps . in the sequel",
    ", we apply the gdop metric to evaluate the localization performance of mimo radar .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :    1 .",
    "the crlb of the target localization estimation error is developed for the general case of mimo  radar with multiple waveforms transmission .",
    "the analytical expressions of the crlb are derived for the case of orthogonal waveforms with non - coherent and coherent observations .",
    "the non - coherent case is used as benchmark for evaluating the performance of the system with coherent observations .",
    "it is shown that the crlb expressions for both the non - coherent and coherent cases can be factored into two terms :  a term incorporating the effect of bandwidth and snr , and another term accounting for the effect of sensor placement .",
    "the crlb of the standard deviation of the localization estimate with non - coherent observations is shown to be inversely proportional to the signals averaged effective bandwidth .",
    "dramatically higher accuracy can be obtained from processing coherent observations . in this case",
    ", the crlb is inversely proportional to the carrier frequency .",
    "this gain is due to the exploitation of phase information , and is referred to as _",
    "coherency gain .",
    "formulating a convex optimization problem , it is shown that symmetric deployment of transmitting and receiving sensors around a target is optimal with respect to minimizing the crlb .",
    "the closed form solution of the optimization problem also reveals that optimally placed @xmath0 transmitters and @xmath1 receivers reduce the crlb on the variance of the estimate by a factor @xmath2 this is referred to as the _ mimo radar gain_. 5 .",
    "a closed form solution is developed for the blue of target localization for coherent mimo radars .",
    "it provides a closed form solution and a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the estimator s mse .",
    "this estimator provides insight into the relation between sensors locations , target location , and localization accuracy through the use of the gdop metric .",
    "contour maps of the gdop , presented in this paper , provide a clear understanding of the mutual relation between a given deployment of sensors and the achievable accuracy at various target locations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the system model is introduced in section [ section : mimoradarconcept ] . in section [ section :",
    "crlb ] , the crlb is derived for the general case of multiple transmitted waveforms .",
    "analytical expressions are obtained for the cases of non - coherent and coherent observations with orthogonal signals .",
    "optimization of the crlb as a function of sensor location is provided in section [ section : optimizationoverall ] .",
    "the performance of two localization estimators is evaluated in section [ section : targetest ] . to establish a better understanding of the relations between the radar geographical spread and the target location ,",
    "the gdop metric is introduced in section [ section : gdop ] .",
    "finally , section [ section : conclusions ] concludes the paper .    a comment on notation : vectors are denoted by lower - case bold , while matrices use upper - case bold letters . the superscripts t  and h  denote the transpose and hermitian operators , respectively .",
    "complex conjugate is denoted @xmath3 .",
    "points in the x - y plane are denoted in upper - case @xmath4",
    "we consider a widely distributed mimo radar system with @xmath0 transmitting radars and @xmath1 receiving radars .",
    "the receiving radars may be colocated with the transmitting ones or individually positioned . the transmitting and receiving radars",
    "are located in a two dimensional plane @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath0 transmitters are arbitrarily located at coordinates @xmath6 @xmath7 , and the @xmath1 receivers are similarly arbitrarily located at coordinates @xmath8 @xmath9 the set of transmitted waveforms in lowpass equivalent form is @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the common duration of all transmitted waveforms .",
    "the power of the transmitted waveforms is normalized such that the aggregate power transmitted by the sensors is constant , irrespective of the number of transmit sensors . to simplify the notation ,",
    "the signal power term is embedded in the noise variance term such that the snr at the transmitter , denoted snr@xmath14 and defined as the transmitted power by a sensor divided by the noise power at a receiving sensor , is set that a desired level .",
    "let all transmitted waveforms be narrowband signals with individual effective bandwidth @xmath15 defined as @xmath16   $ ] , where the integration is over the range of frequencies with non - zero signal content @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we further define the signals averaged effective bandwidth or rms bandwidth _ _  _ _ as @xmath18  and the normalized bandwidth terms as @xmath19 .",
    "the signals are narrowband in the sense that for a carrier frequency of @xmath20 the narrowband signal assumption implies @xmath21 * *  * * @xmath22 and @xmath23 * *  * * @xmath24**. * *    the target model developed here generalizes the model in @xcite to a near - field scenario and distributed sensors . in skolnik s model",
    "@xcite , the returns of individual point scatterers have fixed amplitude and phase , and are independent of angle . for a moving target , the composite return fluctuates in amplitude and phase due to the relative motion of the scatterers .",
    "when the motion is slow , and the composite target return is assumed to be constant over the observation time , the target conforms to the classical swerling case i model .",
    "we now proceed to generalize this model to a target observed by a mimo  radar with distributed sensors .",

    "let @xmath29 denote the propagation time from transmitter @xmath30 to scatterer @xmath31 to receiver @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the speed of light .",
    "our signal model assumes that the sensors are located such that variations in the signal strength due to different target to sensor distances can be neglected , i.e. , the model accounts for the effect of the sensors / target localizations only through time delays ( or phase shifts ) of the signals .",
    "the common path loss term is embedded in @xmath35 the baseband representation for the signal received at sensor @xmath36 is : @xmath37 where the term @xmath38is the phase of a signal transmitted by sensor @xmath30 reflected by scatterer @xmath39 located at @xmath40 and received by sensor @xmath41 phases are measured relative to a common phase reference assumed to be available at the transmitters and receivers .",
    "the term @xmath42 is circularly symmetric , zero - mean , complex gaussian noise , spatially and temporally white with autocorrelation function @xmath43 .",
    "the noise term is set @xmath44snr@xmath14 , where snr@xmath14 is measured at the transmitter .",
    "snr@xmath14 is normalized such that the aggregate transmitted power is independent of the number of transmitting sensors .",
    "the snr at the receiver , due to a scatterer with amplitude @xmath28 , is snr@xmath45snr@xmath46 signals reflected from the target combine at each of the receive antennas .",

    "it follows from this discussion that the extended target is represented by a point scatterer of amplitude @xmath48 and time delays @xmath53 where all the quantities are unknown .    while this target model is completely adequate for our needs , it is possible to extend it slightly , at little cost .",
    "assume a constant time offset error @xmath54 at the receivers .",

    "the gdop is commonly used in gps systems for mapping the attainable localization accuracy for a given layout of gps satellites positions @xcite .",
    "the gdop metric emphasizes the effect of sensors locations by normalizing the localization error with the term contributed by the range estimate .",
    "the gdop metric for the two dimensional case is defined : @xmath369 where @xmath370  and @xmath371  are the variances of localization on the @xmath102 and @xmath103 axis , respectively , and @xmath372 is the standard deviation of the time delay estimation error , assumed the same for all sensors .",
    "inherently , the gdop provides a normalized value that measures the relative contribution of the radars location to the overall accuracy . when the blue is used , and the linearity conditions hold , @xmath370 and @xmath371 are given by ( [ eq : xmseblue ] ) and ( [ eq : ymseblue ] ) , respectively .",
    "using the result in ( [ eq:22 ] ) , @xmath373 for the time delay variance , we get the following gdop expression : @xmath374    the gdop reduces the combined effect of the locations of the sensors to a single metric .",
    "once we get the values mapped , the actual localization error is easily derived by multiplying the gdop value with @xmath375 .",

    "when a target is located inside the virtual @xmath387-sided system footprint , a higher localization accuracy is obtained than when a target is outside the footprint of the system . in particular ,",
    "the best localization is obtained for a target at the center of the system .",

    "outside the footprint , the gdop values increase rather rapidly .    in figure [ fig:4 ] and",

    "when the viewing angle of the target is very restricted , as in figure [ fig:5 ] , there is a marked degradation of gdop  values .",
    "these examples demonstrate the main theoretical result of section iv , namely that a symmetrical deployment of sensors around the target yields the lowest gdop values .",
    "furthermore , calculating the lowest attainable gdop value using the optimal results in ( [ eq : opttrace ] ) for a @xmath388 mimo  radar , we obtain a gdop value of @xmath389 , and for @xmath390 it is equal to @xmath391 . as a numerical example , the lowest gdops in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] are @xmath392 and @xmath393respectively . comparing this with the results obtained in @xcite for the case of passive gps  based systems , with @xmath1 satellites optimally positioned around the target , for which the lowest achievable gdop value is @xmath394 ,",

    "<S> we further prove that optimization over the sensors positions lowers the crlb by a factor equal to the product of the number of transmitting and receiving sensors . </S>",
    "<S> the best linear unbiased estimator ( blue ) is derived for the mimo target localization problem . </S>",
