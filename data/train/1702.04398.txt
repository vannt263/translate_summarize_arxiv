    "radio frequency identification ( rfid ) is a promising technology for the proliferation of internet of things ( iot ) applications , and it can be used to detect and identify the items in the proximity@xcite . due to their cost",
    "effective , durable , and energy efficient operation  @xcite , rfid technology has been used in wide range of applications such as asset management @xcite , access control@xcite , public safety@xcite , localization@xcite , and tracking @xcite . among these , enabling high accuracy localization for massively deployed iot devices carries critical importance for a diverse set of iot applications  @xcite .",
    "localization using radio frequency ( rf ) signals has been actively researched in the literature over the past decades@xcite .",
    "outdoor localization is mostly handled with global positioning system ( gps ) technology whereas indoor localization requires alternative approaches since gps needs a line - of - sight connection between user equipment and satellites .",
    "moreover , massive deployment of iot devices necessitates energy and cost efficient localization methods for prolonged durations .",
    "the rfid technology hence becomes a promising alternative for cost - effective , energy efficient indoor identification and localization for massively deployed iot .    an ultra high frequency ( uhf ) rfid communication is fundamentally different from the conventional rf communication since it has two distinct links : the forward ( power - up ) and the reverse ( backscatter ) link .",
    "the forward link powers the passive rfid tags and the reverse link carries the information of tags .",
    "ability to power - up tags in the forward link enables _ battery - less _ operation of rfid tags@xcite , which is a major advantage of rfid systems for low - power iot applications . in general , there are two configurations for uhf rfid systems : 1 ) monostatic configuration , and 2 ) bistatic configuration . in the monostatic configuration ,",
    "a single reader antenna transmits the continuous wave , which powers up the passive tag , and subsequently receives the backscattered information signal from the tag . in the bistatic configuration the transmission and reception",
    "are handled by different reader antennas as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iotframework ] .",
    "these antennas might be co - located ( i.e. , at same location , closely spaced ) or dislocated ( at separate locations ) .",
    "a particular challenge with both configuration is that complex , directional , and three dimensional rfid propagation models need to be explicitly taken into account to accurately characterize the real - world forward / backward propagation channels .    in this paper",
    ", we use sophisticated and realistic 3d path - loss and radiation models to study fundamental lower bounds on the localization accuracy of received signal strength ( rss ) based uhf rfid localization systems for both monostatic and bistatic configurations .",
    "the main contributions of this work are as follows : 1 ) cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) on the localization accuracy are derived in closed - form considering an enhanced rss model , using the _ directional _ and _ 3d _ radiation pattern from uhf rfid reader antennas , and the concept of _ localization coverage _ ; 2 ) tag and reader sensitivity is incorporated into analytic derivations both for monostatic and bistatic scenarios , to derive _ localizability _ and _ localization coverage _ metrics ; 3 ) extensive computer simulations are carried out to compare the localization accuracy of the maximum likelihood ( ml ) technique with the crlbs , considering directional radiation patterns and using different configurations for rfid reader antennas .",
    "our analysis and simulation results show that for certain scenarios , using bistatic antenna configuration as in fig .",
    "[ fig : iotframework ] may increase the average localization coverage by @xmath0 when compared to monostatic rfid configuration .",
    "another important parameter in the antenna configurations is the elevation angle @xmath1 . especially with lower transmit powers",
    ", it affects the localization coverage and accuracy .",
    "corner placement of antennas for @xmath2 with @xmath3  mw gives @xmath4 localization coverage , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 results in @xmath7 .",
    "our results for the specific rfid configuration show that it is possible to locate a tag within @xmath8  meter error with a probability of @xmath9 with corner placement of antennas , whereas this probability drastically reduces to @xmath10 when side placement is used for @xmath11 with bistatic configuration .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "literature review for rss - based localization in passive uhf rfid systems is provided in section [ sect : litrev ] . in section [",

    "after the mapping phase , the robot may locate itself inside the building based on the closest tag information . in the landmarc localization technique introduced in @xcite ,",
    "reference rfid tags are used for implementing rss - based indoor localization method , where fixed - location reference tags with known locations are used to localize the tags . in @xcite , authors improve landmarc approach to tackle with multipath effects and rf interference .",

    "typically a simple path - loss model is used for rfid propagation models in the existing literature @xcite , which employs free - space path - loss signal strength model .",
    "these models are not capable of accurately capturing the radiation pattern of rfid reader antennas since they are highly directional .",
    "there are also several experimental studies in the literature related to rss - based uhf rfid localization systems . in @xcite , an experimentation with passive uhf rfid system",

    "recently in @xcite , crlb of rss - based localization are derived considering a frequency dependent path - loss propagation model , where the model explicitly depends on the transmit power level and the transmission frequency .",
    "accuracy of several localization techniques are compared to crlb with given path - loss model via simulations and experiments . in @xcite , authors used @xmath12-nearest neighbor ( knn ) algorithm to estimate the location of the target tag from rss information . an experiment involving four antennas and seventy tags is conducted , which resembles to the simulation scenario in our manuscript . it is shown that power control techniques may significantly improve localization accuracy .",

    "a localization algorithm using the differences of rss values from various tags under same conditions is also proposed .",
    "its performance , which is shown to outperform the knn algorithm used in landmarc@xcite . a two - parameter path - loss model for uhf rfid systems is constructed in @xcite , which shows that the rss of rfid systems are slightly more stable than wifi rss values , and this yields more precise location estimates for rfid rss - based localization . in our earlier work@xcite",
    ", we have studied the bounds on rfid localization for monostatic rfid configuration . in this study ,",
    "our additional contributions include : 1 ) use of bistatic antenna configuration and different antenna placement which provides a more generalized framework , 2 ) use of an enhanced rss model with lognormal distributed noise which yields different crlb formulations , 3 ) incorporation of reader antenna and tag sensitivity into theoretical analysis , 4 ) study of _ localization coverage _ for rfid tags , outside of which they can not be localized with a reasonable accuracy , and 5 ) extensive new simulations to study the effects of various parameters and configurations .",
