    "the cosmological principle states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "although it was originally invoked for the sake of simplicity , it is by now solidly grounded by observations .",
    "a friedman - robertson - walker metric accurately describes the evolution of the universe on large scales , and it suffices to explain phenomena that range from the abundance of the light elements to the ( near ) isotropy of the cosmic microwave background",
    ". however , homogeneity and isotropy are clearly just approximations .",
    "because of the same cosmological principle , we are able to describe inhomogeneities and anisotropies in our universe as small perturbations around the lowest order homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "there is a generalized sense of homogeneity and isotropy that may also apply to these perturbations , namely , _",
    "statistical _ isotropy and homogeneity .",
    "we shall not extensively dwell on these concepts , and simply note that perturbations are statistically homogeneous and isotropic if their ensemble averages are invariant under translations and rotations ( see for instance @xcite . ) given that the cosmological principle appears to be solidly grounded by observations at this point , it is time to inquire  instead of postulating  whether perturbations also satisfy the generalized , statistical , cosmological principle .",
    "certain anomalies in the temperature anisotropies in the cmb actually suggest that the answer is negative @xcite .",
    "if perturbations and the underlying background were completely independent from each other , the symmetries of the latter would not have to bear any relation with the statistical symmetries of the former .",
    "however , this independence is not in agreement with our ideas about the origin of structure . according to our present understanding , the structures that we observe originated from tiny primordial perturbations that were generated during a seeding stage in the early universe @xcite . as a result",
    ", primordial perturbations always seem to carry the symmetries of the background on top of which they were seeded .",
    "inflation for instance is typically driven by a homogeneous scalar field , and as consequence , primordial perturbations created during inflation are statistically homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "it is also possible to seed primordial perturbations in an anisotropic but homogeneous universe , and , in agreement with our claim , the resulting primordial perturbations turn out to be statistically homogeneous but anisotropic @xcite .",
    "if the universe is inhomogeneous during the seeding stage , the statistical properties of primordial perturbations will accordingly reflect those spatial variations @xcite .",
    "the conclusion that seems to emerge from our previous discussion is that if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic during the seeding state , primordial perturbations have to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic . in this article",
    "we argue that this conclusion does not necessarily hold .",
    "we present a class of models for the origin of structure in which the universe is exactly homogeneous and isotropic throughout the seeding stage , with the peculiarity that the resulting primordial perturbations are statistically anisotropic or inhomogeneous .",
    "the class of models that we are going to consider bears a significant relation to previous works in the literature .",
    "it contains a set of three arbitrary non - canonical scalar fields @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 ) minimally coupled to einstein gravity @xcite . the action of this  scalar triad \" is @xmath2,\\ ] ] where the @xmath3 are functions of a single argument metric signature . ]",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 is the lagrangian of the remaining matter fields @xmath6 , which can include couplings to the triad . from a different perspective",
    ", the triad can be regarded as part of the gravitational sector ; the action ( [ eq : action ] ) then leads to what one could interpret as a modification of gravity @xcite .",
    "note that throughout this work we use einstein s summation convention ; a sum over indices is implied only if they are in opposite positions .",
    "otherwise , the location of internal and spatial indices does not have any significance .",
    "the stability of the system described by the action ( [ eq : action ] ) imposes conditions on the functions @xmath3 .",
    "the requirement that perturbations around any background value of @xmath7 have a positive definite hamiltonian ( in order for the theory to be ghost - free ) implies @xcite @xmath8 in turn , the last two conditions guarantee that the system has a well - defined initial value formulation , at least locally , that is , that scalar perturbations propagate around appropriate characteristic cones .    the field equations of motion",
    "take the form of a conservation law , which is an expression of the symmetry of the action under shifts of the scalars , @xmath9 the energy - momentum tensor of the triad is simply the sum of the energy - momentum tensors of the individual scalars , @xmath10",
    "we are interested in cosmological solutions that satisfy the cosmological principle , that is , in spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes , @xmath11 as opposed to what one would naively expect , homogeneous configurations do not require the field itself to be homogeneous .",
    "since the action ( [ eq : action ] ) only depends on the three scalars through their derivatives , the actual value of the fields is physically irrelevant , since only their gradients have physical meaning .",
    "therefore , homogeneous configurations only require that the field gradients be spatially constant .",
    "hence , rather than assuming that the spatial gradients are zero , as is typically done , we shall study the ansatz @xmath12 which in conjunction with equation ( [ eq : frw ] ) results in @xmath13 note that we are implicitly assuming that @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "indeed , one can readily verify that for time - independent @xmath14 , the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) solves the equation of motion ( [ eq : motion ] ) . as a matter of fact , for the metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) the equation of motion reads @xmath15 which is clearly satisfied by the ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "note that a prime denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time , and @xmath16 is the flat space laplacian .",
    "although the configuration ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) does respect homogeneity , it does appear to violate isotropy , since the field gradients @xmath17 are not invariant under spatial rotations .",
    "however , this impression is misleading , because the contributions of each scalar to the energy momentum tensor ( which is all gravity sees ) may add to an isotropic energy momentum tensor .",
    "in fact , the total energy momentum tensor of the three scalars is given by    @xmath18    therefore , if @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath20 , the energy - momentum tensor is invariant under spatial rotations . the simplest way to satisfy",
    "this condition is to assume that the lagrangians are identical , @xmath21 in this case the theory has a @xmath22 symmetry that acts on the three scalar fields by permutation . for lagrangians linear in @xmath23 ,",
    "this @xmath22 is just a subgroup of @xmath24 .",
    "if conditions ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) are satisfied , the stresses are isotropic , and we can therefore identify @xmath25 as , respectively , the energy density and pressure of the scalar triad . in this sense ,",
    "the three scalar fields are analogous to the group of three vectors described in @xcite ; the field gradients play then the role of of the spacelike vectors .",
    "let us note that the ghost - free condition @xmath26 implies , in conjunction with @xmath27 , that @xmath28 .",
    "the scalar triad can not behave like a phantom @xcite .    for the sake of illustration",
    ", it is going to be convenient to have a class of concrete lagrangians in mind . for our purposes",
    "it will suffice to consider a simple but sufficiently general set of models with lagrangian @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two arbitrary dimensionful constants and @xmath32 is an arbitrary exponent . in this case",
    ", the triad always behaves like a fluid with equation of state @xmath33 the lagrangian satisfies the stability conditions ( [ eq : stability ] ) if @xmath34",
    "our first goal is to show that within the class of models that we are studying it is possible to create statistically anisotropic scalar primordial perturbations .",
    "we shall first define what we mean by  scalar \" and show that in our decomposition of the perturbations scalars , vectors and tensors generally couple to each other .",
    "let us start by considering metric perturbations in longitudinal gauge , @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a transverse vector , and @xmath37 is a symmetric transverse and traceless tensor . essentially , we just have decomposed the metric perturbations in irreducible representations of a subgroup of symmetries of the frw metric , namely , spatial rotations . rather than proceeding similarly with the triad perturbations",
    ", it will be instructive to expand @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a scalar and @xmath40 is a transverse vector , @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , our scalar field background ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is not invariant under spatial rotations , but instead , remains unchanged under a @xmath24 group of symmetries @xmath42 the decomposition ( [ eq : field perturbations ] ) , as well as ( [ eq : metric perturbations ] ) , is a decomposition of perturbations in irreducible representations of the latter group of transformations .    we shall not write down the different components of the linearized einstein tensor , which can be found in many different monographs on the subject ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "consider for instance the decomposition in irreducible representations of the last term in equation ( [ eq : ij ] ) , @xmath45 the scalar @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 @xcite , which does not vanish and does depend on the tensor @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the linearized einstein equations couple scalars to vectors and tensors . the same conclusion holds",
    "if the triad perturbations are expressed in terms of the variables @xmath48 .",
    "the violation of the decomposition theorem @xcite was noted in a similar context in @xcite .",
    "note by the way that the term @xmath49 in equation ( [ eq : ij ] ) gives a mass to the graviton @xcite .",
    "there are two cases where scalars , vectors and tensors can be decoupled , namely , when @xmath50 or when the metric perturbations themselves are negligible . in the first case ,",
    "the group of transformations ( [ eq : group ] ) is not just a symmetry of the background , but also a symmetry of the action . as a result of this enhanced symmetry",
    "the triad perturbations turn out to be statistically isotropic , as we shall see below .",
    "we are hence led to the limit in which the metric perturbations are much bigger than the triad perturbations , and are thus negligible .",
    "we expect this to be the case , for example , if the expansion of the universe is sufficiently close to de sitter .",
    "we shall study now the perturbations in the triad created during a stage of seeding in the early universe . at this point",
    "it is not important to specify what is the dominant component of the universe during that stage ; it could be the triad itself , or it could be a different scalar , like in curvaton models @xcite .",
    "we shall simply assume that the early universe inflates , and , for definiteness , that its effective equation of state @xmath51 is constant , @xmath52    in order to calculate the primordial spectrum of metric perturbations , we have to specify some of the details of the transition between the seeding stage and a radiation dominated universe .",
    "if reheating is instantaneous and occurs along an hypersurface of constant @xmath53 , we find that after a stage of inflation with equation of state @xmath51 the universe contains metric perturbations ( in longitudinal gauge ) even though they were negligible during inflation @xcite , @xmath54 similarly , if the decay rate of the component that drives the seeding stage depends on the squared gradients of the triad @xmath7 , perturbations in the latter will be converted into adiabatic primordial perturbations at the end of the seeding stage @xcite . in our theory , by assumption , the lagrangian is symmetric under shifts of the scalars and permutations , so the decay rate has to be of the form @xmath55 . as a consequence , we expect primordial perturbations of the order @xmath56 where @xmath57 has been defined in equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath58 is typically of order one , an hence , primordial perturbations are again proportional to @xmath57 . in the following",
    "we shall calculate the spectrum of @xmath57 .",
    "we are ready now to calculate the action for the cosmological perturbations .",
    "as mentioned above , we are neglecting metric perturbations , so all we have to do is expand the action of the scalars to quadratic order in the presence of an unperturbed frw metric .",
    "proceeding in this manner we arrive at @xmath59,\\ ] ] from which one can directly derive the stability conditions ( [ eq : stability ] ) . note that we have expressed the field perturbations in terms of the perturbed fields @xmath48 .",
    "these are the fields that decouple in the absence of metric perturbations . when we substitute equation ( [ eq : field perturbations ] ) into the action ( [ eq : delta s ] ) , we find that the term proportional to @xmath60 couples the vector @xmath40 to the scalar @xmath39 . the very same term manifestly breaks rotational invariance in the action , and will be ultimately responsible for the generation of statistically anisotropic perturbations .    in order to quantize the perturbations , it is convenient to further decompose them in fourier modes of an appropriately rescaled scalar field ( with periodic boundary conditions ) , @xmath61 note that @xmath62 plays the role of an  effective \" scale factor , sometimes referred to as the pump field .",
    "substituting the expansion ( [ eq : v ] ) into the action ( [ eq : delta s ] ) , and employing the particular class of models in ( [ eq : l ] ) we arrive at @xmath63,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the anisotropic dispersion relation of the field perturbation @xmath48 and @xmath65 is the comoving volume of the universe .. as the reader may have expected , the dispersion relation is isotropic only if @xmath66 vanishes ( @xmath67 ) .    the quantization of ( [ eq : v a ] ) proceeds along the conventional lines @xcite .",
    "the properly normalized mode functions are @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath70    using the definition of @xmath57 in equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) , and the relation between @xmath40 and @xmath48 in equation ( [ eq : v ] ) it is now straightforward to calculate the spectrum of @xmath71 for @xmath72 the spectrum is constant on large scales @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , in that limit it can be evaluated at any convenient time , which we choose to be the time at which a reference mode @xmath74 crosses the horizon , @xmath75 . on large scales",
    "the primordial spectrum is then @xmath76 where the dispersion relation @xmath77 is given by equation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) , and the index @xmath78 is given by equation ( [ eq : nu ] ) .",
    "the equation of state of the dominant component during inflation is @xmath51 , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote , respectively , the energy density and pressure of the triad at the time of crossing .",
    "if @xmath81 , primordial perturbations are statistically anisotropic , even though the background energy - momentum tensor and the spacetime metric are invariant under rotations . in any case , the primordial spectrum still possesses certain remnant symmetries .",
    "in particular , it is scale free and invariant under spatial inversions , @xmath82 .",
    "the scaling symmetry follows from the structure of the power spectrum , which is a product of two functions , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "one could ask whether this factorization is generic , or whether it is just particular feature of our set of models . by tracing back the steps we took to derive the power spectrum",
    ", we see that the origin of this property is the form of the dispersion relation @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath77 consists of terms with different powers of @xmath85 , @xmath86 can not be factorized .",
    "similarly , it is easy to see that the parity symmetry arises from the symmetry of the dispersion relation .",
    "dispersion relations with odd powers of @xmath87 would lead to parity violations .    as we shall argue below",
    ", the factorization of the primordial spectrum allows us to identify an effective spectral index of the perturbations , @xmath88 . in the following",
    "we shall focus on the phenomenologically preferred case of scale invariant perturbations , @xmath89 .",
    "the spectrum is scale invariant in this generalized sense if @xmath90 , which implies @xmath91 we can compare this condition with the equation that relates the expansion of the universe to the parameter @xmath32 when the triad dominates the energy density of the universe , equation ( [ eq : w ] ) . only for @xmath92",
    "are both mutually consistent . however , for this value of the parameter perturbations are quantum - mechanically unstable .",
    "hence , in this class of models , the component that drives inflation can not be the triad . because stability requires @xmath93 , and since in our context the seeding requires a stage of inflation , @xmath94 , the range of values of exponents compatible with a scale invariant spectrum is @xmath95 .",
    "these conclusions are closely tied to our class of lagrangians ( [ eq : l ] ) , and could be relaxed in other types of models .",
    "let us briefly describe what type of signatures a spectrum of the form ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) would leave on the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the impact of an arbitrary statistically anisotropic spectrum of primordial perturbations on the cmb was calculated in @xcite , so all we have to do is apply the formalism developed in the last reference , which the reader may consult for further details .",
    "our starting point is the decomposition of the primordial spectrum in spherical harmonics , @xmath96 the functions @xmath97 quantify the power in the harmonic @xmath98 as a function of scale @xmath99 .",
    "for statistically isotropic perturbations , only the scalar component @xmath100 differs from zero .",
    "certainly , this is not the case in our class of models . in particular , comparing equation ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) with equation ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) , and remembering that the spectra of @xmath57 and @xmath101 just differ by an overall constant , we arrive at @xmath102 where @xmath46 is an overall amplitude we shall not worry about . because all the harmonics share the same power of @xmath99 we can identify @xmath103 as the spectral index of the primordial spectrum . since the spectrum is invariant under spatial inversions , harmonics with an odd angular momentum quantum number vanish , @xmath104 for odd @xmath105 .",

    "the different harmonics of the power spectrum are connected to the statistical properties of the cmb . in particular , the expectation value of the estimator typically used to measure the angular power spectrum is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the conventional transfer function @xcite .",
    "therefore , the angular power spectrum , as defined above , does not contain any information about statistical anisotropies , since it is only sensitive to the scalar component of the power spectrum @xmath100 .",
    "if the spectrum is scale invariant ( in our generalized sense ) , statistically anisotropic perturbations will fit the angular power spectrum as well as statistically isotropic ones .",
    "the anisotropic components of the power spectrum affect the non - diagonal two - point functions , @xmath112 where @xmath31 is a product of clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite .",

    "<S> in almost all structure formation models , primordial perturbations are created within a homogeneous and isotropic universe , like the one we observe . </S>",
    "<S> because their ensemble averages inherit the symmetries of the spacetime in which they are seeded , cosmological perturbations then happen to be statistically isotropic and homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> certain anomalies in the cosmic microwave background on the other hand suggest that perturbations do not satisfy these statistical properties , thereby challenging perhaps our understanding of structure formation . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we relax this tension . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the universe contains an appropriate triad of scalar fields with spatially constant but non - zero gradients , it is possible to generate statistically anisotropic and inhomogeneous primordial perturbations , even though the energy momentum tensor of the triad itself is invariant under translations and rotations . </S>"
