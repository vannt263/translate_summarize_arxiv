    "many extensions of the standard model predict hidden sectors of particles that are only weakly interacting with known matter . some of these particles may even be extremely light ( sub - ev ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , if they are ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken ( anomalous ) global symmetries or gauge bosons of exact hidden symmetries . in some cases these light particles can be motivated by short - comings of the standard model , for instance the axion as a dynamical solution to the strong @xmath0 problem .",
    "we will give a brief outline of axion models in sect .",
    "[ sec : axion ] .",
    "other weakly interacting sub - ev particles  gev ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : axion ] ) . ]",
    "( wisps ) can be considered from their phenomenological point of view , having strong influence on early universe physics , astrophysics and even laboratory experiments despite their feeble interactions . in many cases",
    "these probes are independent of the particular origin of the light hidden sector and provide very general and simple test scenarios , _ e.g. _ , if the possible interaction of wisps with standard model matter can be constrained by gauged and global symmetries . as an example , sect .",

    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "non - abelian gauge theories possess non - trivial solutions of the classical equations of motion in 4-dimensional euclidean space - time , so - called _ instantons _ , that can be classified by an integer number , the pontryagin index @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the field tensor of the non - abelian field with coupling @xmath3 ( see _ e.g. _ the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "each instanton solution with @xmath4 is associated with a vacuum @xmath5 , that is left invariant under infinitesimal gauge transformations .",
    "however , there also exist gauge transformations with non - trivial winding number mapping between instanton solutions with different topological index .",
    "the true vacuum of non - abelian gauge theories is therefore a superposition of the vacua @xmath5 , the @xmath6-_vacuum _ .",
    "the phase @xmath7 contributes as an effective lagrangian of the field theory , @xmath8 which transforms as a pseudo - scalar and hence violates @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath6-term of strong interaction is in general not invariant under chiral transformations in the presence of weak interactions and massive chiral fermions .",
    "the physical parameter is the combination @xmath9 , which contributes to the neutron s electric dipole moment as @xmath10 .",
    "the current limit of @xmath11 translates into a limit of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the _ strong @xmath0 problem _ can now be formulated as the question why the sum of _ a priori _ independent phases in @xmath13 contributing to strong @xmath0-violation cancel with such a high accuracy .",
    "an elegant solution to this problem has been proposed by _",
    "peccei _ and _ quinn _",
    "they introduced an anomalous global chiral symmetry u@xmath14 which is spontaneously broken at the peccei - quinn ( pq ) scale @xmath15 .",
    "the axion corresponds to the pseudo - goldstone boson of the broken symmetry , that receives a periodic potential at the quantum level  @xcite due to chiral anomalies ) and qed ( @xmath16 ) contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqlag ] ) . ] , @xmath17 one can show that the qcd contributions ( @xmath18 ) are bounded as @xmath19 in terms of a shifted axion field @xmath20 with effective pq scale @xmath21 . the strong @xmath0 problem is hence solved dynamically when the axion field settles down at its minimum @xmath22 .",
    "the original pqww model  @xcite includes a second higgs doublet in the breaking of u@xmath14 which relates the pq breaking scale to the electroweak scale @xmath23  gev .",
    "this model is now ruled out _ e.g. _  by life - time measurements of mesons  @xcite",
    ". still viable variants of this model , so - called _",
    "invisible _ axion models , introduce additional higgs bosons as electro - weak scalars which decouple the pq scale from the weak scale .",
    "the mass of the axion can be determinant via current algebra techniques and is related to the ratio @xmath24 of up and down quarks together with the pion s mass @xmath25 and decay constant @xmath26 as @xmath27 the qed contribution ( @xmath16 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqlag ] ) corresponds to a coupling term between axions and photons of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29\\,.\\ ] ] note that the first term in the coupling  ( [ eq : axioncoupling ] ) is a contribution form chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the most popular examples are the dfsz(-type ) models  @xcite with @xmath30 and ksvz(-type ) models  @xcite with @xmath31 .",
    "invisible axion models are constrained by their ( model - dependent ) axion coupling to matter and photons .",
    "in particular , astrophysical environments provide strong limits on the viable range of axion mass @xmath32 and coupling @xmath33 via photon conversion into axions in compton - like scattering , by the primakoff process or via hadronic or electromagnetic axion bremsstrahlung ( for a review see  @xcite ) . depending on their production mechanism in the early universe",
    ", axions may also contribute today as ( a part of ) cold or warm dark matter and could be detected in tunable microwave cavitys  @xcite .",
    "all these probes leave a window of viable axion models in the range @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "generalizations of the qcd axion are _ axion - like particles _ ( alps ) .",
    "this class of particles includes pseudo - scalars @xmath36 with a photon interaction of type  ( [ eq : axioncoupling ] ) but with masses and couplings kept as independent parameters .",
    "pseudo - scalar alps may also originate via a pq - type mechanisms and are generic in many supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "strong bounds on the coupling @xmath37 arise from the direct search of alps produced in the sun via helioscopes  @xcite .",
    "laboratory bounds from optical and light - shining - through - a - wall ( lsw ) experiment are typically three orders of magnitude weaker , but somewhat more model - independent  @xcite .",
    "scalar alps with a coupling @xmath38 can not be motivated by a pq - type mechanism , but generally share the bounds of pseudo - scalar alp models .",
    "in addition , scalar alps are strongly constrained by their contribution to non - newtonian forces  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the standard model , in particular supersymmetric and/or string theories predict a plethora of additional particles , some of which might be extremely light  @xcite .",
    "these hidden sectors may couple to the standard model via renormalizable interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ , via gauge kinetic mixing , the higgs portal or yukawa - type couplings .",
    "hence , these interactions are not expected to be suppressed by the mass scale of messenger sectors .",
    "we will briefly discuss the case of weakly interacting sub - ev particles ( wisps ) arising from kinetic mixing .",
    "gauge bosons @xmath39 of a hidden sector u@xmath40 , so - called _ hidden photons _ or _ paraphotons _ , can couple to photons @xmath41 via a mixing term  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the field tensors of u@xmath45 and u@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "kinetic mixing naturally arises in field theoretic extensions of the standard model , where hidden sector particles are simultaneously charged under both u@xmath46s .",
    "if kinetic mixing is absent at the tree level , 1-loop diagrams give contributions of the form  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the masses of a ( non - degenerate ) pair of hidden sector particles in the loop .",
    "typically , field or string theoretical predictions of @xmath50 are in the range from @xmath51 to @xmath52  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the full kinetic lagrangian can be diagonalized via a shift @xmath53 and a re - definition of the fine - structure constant @xmath54 .",
    "the shift of the hidden photon field can have several effects .",
    "if the hidden u@xmath40 is unbroken , hidden sector matter with a hidden charge @xmath55 receives a electromagnetic charge of the form @xmath56 , which can be extremely small for @xmath57 and/or @xmath58 , resulting in _ mini - charged particles _ ( mcps )",
    "@xcite . if the hidden photon is massive via a higgs or stckelberg mechanism the diagonalization of the kinetic term results in off - diagonal elements in the mass matrix .",
    "these terms are responsible for vacuum oscillations between photons and hidden photons with a probability  @xcite @xmath59    similar to the previous case , mcps and hidden photons have a rich phenomenology with strong bounds coming from astrophysical and cosmological environments  @xcite .",
    "the strongest bounds on the charge of sub - kev mcps come from energy loss arguments of horizontal branch stars or white dwarves giving @xmath60 .",
    "massive hidden photons in the sub - ev range receive also strong bounds from solar production and distortions of the cmb .",
    "however , due to the mass - dependence @xmath61 in the presence of short baselines , @xmath62 , future experiments have the potential to probe previously unconstrained hidden photon models ( see _ e.g. _  ref .",
    "this includes lsw experiments with optical lasers  @xcite and microwave cavities  @xcite or hidden photon helioscopes with extended baselines  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed bottom - up motivations of light hidden sector particles that are weakly interacting with photons , so - called wisps .",
    "axions are introduced as a solution to the strong @xmath0 problem via the peccei - quinn mechanism . other wisps , in particular axion - like particles , mini - charged particles or hidden photons",
    "may arise in field or string theoretic extensions of the standard model .",
    "these light hidden sectors interacting with photons have a rich phenomenology , testable by early universe , astrophysical environments and laboratory experiments .",
