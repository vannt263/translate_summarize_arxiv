    ", we restricted our study to the cases where the complex visibilities are observed and where the observed scene is a collection of point - like sources .",
    "this correspond , for instance , to the science case of the instrument gravitywhich will be installed at the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) to carry out astrometry with absolute phase reference of stars in the galactic center or in globular clusters @xcite . in some sense",

    "in addition to processing multi - variate data , we also introduce the explicit minimization of a non - differentiable regularization term so as to favor spatial sparsity of the reconstructed brightness distribution in a way which is known to be more efficient @xcite than greedy algorithms like clean@xcite or the _ building - block method _ @xcite . the method presented in this paper",
    "improves over early developments presented as an invited paper at the 2012 spie conf . on astronomical telescopes & instrumentation in amsterdam@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we first summarize the inverse approach for image reconstruction from interferometric data and discuss various possibilities to impose spatial sparsity , we then detail our algorithm for minimizing the objective function ; finally we present some results on simulated data and discuss the advantages of our approach .",
    "following an inverse approach , we state image reconstruction as a constrained optimization problem @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the sought image parameters , @xmath4 is the number of parameters , @xmath5 is the subset of feasible parameters , @xmath6 is a data fitting term which enforces agreement of the model with the measurements @xmath7 , @xmath8 is a regularization term and @xmath9 is a so - called hyper - parameter used to tune the relative weight of the regularization . following a bayesian interpretation , @xmath10 is the opposite of the log - likelihood of the measurements , @xmath11 is the opposite of the log of the prior distribution of the parameters , and @xmath12 defines the maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimate .",

    "may be easily exploited to parallelize the code to apply @xmath32 ( or its adjoint @xmath39 ) to a given argument .",
    "second , an algorithm such as the _ nonuniform fast fourier transform _ ( nu - fft ) @xcite can be implemented to speed up the computations by approximating the operator @xmath40 by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , @xmath43 interpolates the discrete spatial frequencies resulting from the dft at the frequencies observed in @xmath29th channel and @xmath44 is a zero - padding and apodizing operator .",
    "zero - padding improves the accuracy of the approximation , while apodization pre - compensates for the convolution by the interpolation kernel used in @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "assuming gaussian noise distribution , the likelihood term writes : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a statistical weighting matrix ; in principle , @xmath47 is the inverse of the covariance matrix of the measurements : @xmath48 .      due to the voids in the spatial frequencies covered by the observations",
    ", the constraints provided by the data alone do not suffice to define a unique image .",
    "the prior constraints imposed by @xmath8 are then required to help choosing a unique solution among all the images that are compatible with the measurements .    in this paper , we focus on a particular type of astronomical targets which consist in a number of point - like sources with different spectral energy distributions .",
    "this includes the case of multiple stars , globular clusters , or groups of stars as observed in the center of our galaxy . for such objects , the most effective means to regularize the problem is to favor spatially sparse distributions , _",
    "i.e._images with as few sources as possible on a dark background . in this section ,",
    "we derive expressions of the regularization term @xmath8 suitable to favor spatially sparse distributions .",
    "it is now well known that using the @xmath49 norm as the regularization term is an effective mean to impose the sparsity of the solution while approximating the data @xcite .",
    "this leads to take @xmath50 with : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the sign function applied element - wise to the parameters @xmath20 . when the parameters are non - negative , @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",

    "where the model is spectrally separable , the global criterion defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : image - problem ] ) is therefore separable along the spectral dimension .",
    "provided data from different spectral channels are statistically independent , the image reconstruction can be solved independently for each spectral channel .    if the wavelength samples @xmath56 of the discrete model @xmath20 of @xmath1 do not coincide with the effective wavelengths of the data , spectral interpolation of the model is required to match the observed wavelengths . in this case ,",
    "a certain spectral correlation is intrinsic to the model and the 3-d image reconstruction has to be performed globally even if the regularization does not impose any kind of spectral continuity .",
    "physically , sources emit light at all wavelengths and we expect better image reconstruction if we can favor restored sources having the same position whatever the wavelength .",
    "clearly , this is not achieved by the regularization @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sparse - prior ] ) which is fully separable . in order to impose some spectral continuity",
    "while favoring spatial sparsity , we consider the following regularization instead @xcite : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the spatial index ( pixel ) and @xmath29 the spectral channel .",
    "the fact that such a regularization favors spatial sparsity and spectral grouping is a consequence of the triangular inequality @xcite .",
    "this sparsity prior is a special case of several recent generalizations such as group lasso@xcite , mixed norms @xcite or structured sparsity @xcite .",

    "non - linear conjugate gradient method @xcite or limited memory quasi - newton methods such as vmlm - b @xcite are quite efficient and easy to use as they only require computing the cost function and its gradient .",
    "a notable exception is macim@xcite which is based on a markov - chain - monte - carlo ( mcmc ) optimization strategy suitable , in theory , for any type of criteria , in particular the non - smooth and non - convex ones ; in practice , this is however too computationally intensive for estimating a large number of parameters as it is the case for image reconstruction . when using non smooth regularizations as the ones in eq .",

    "another possible splitting would have been to choose the auxiliary variables as @xmath71 but this would have prevented us to exploit the separability of the resulting penalty with respect to @xmath20 .",

    "finally , we consider the possibility of warm starting the algorithm with a solution previously computed .",
    "this latter feature is of interest to improve a solution if too few iterations have been performed or to find the solution of the problem with a slightly different value of the hyper - parameter @xmath86 .    in appendix",

    "this is our motivation for imposing @xmath87 on the variables @xmath20 and not on the variables @xmath66 .",
