    "coulomb drag between current carrying systems has been studied in numerous papers both experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "the earliest experiments were done in two dimensional systems . in this configurations",
    "the electrons are combined to two - dimensional layers .",
    "in one such layer a current is driven and another conducting layer is brought to within close proximity of the first . the coulomb interaction between the electrons in these two layers causes a transfer of momentum and the second layer acquires a current .",
    "this current is referred to as the drag current .",
    "recently , the phenomenon of coulomb drag in one dimensional systems has attracted much attention , particularly with regards to nanowires and nanotechnology   @xcite .",
    "the basic description of the one dimensional case is identical to that in two dimensions . in all of these systems the time averaged charge density of the systems",
    "are translationally invariant .",
    "the coupling of the two systems is due to charge fluctuations in the two systems .",
    "it is known however that the long range character of the coulomb interaction can lead to the formation of a wigner crystal in which the electrons become localized and form a periodic lattice .",
    "numerical simulations on one dimensional systems indicate that an arbitrarily weak long range interaction will lead to the formation of a wigner crystal@xcite .",
    "this long range nature of the coulomb force should be apparent for low electron densities .",
    "in this paper we consider the drag between two such wigner crystals .",
    "it is evident that this system has a non - uniform charge distributions and we will show that this in principle can lead to a much higher value of the drag current .",
    "it is the aim of this section to analyze from a classical perspective some aspects of current drag that we may expect in a quantum mechanical treatment of the wigner crystal .",
    "the wigner crystal is as a system where the electrons are effectively localized , so it is reasonable to expect that some aspects of the current drag between wigner crystals may be exhibited in a classical system .    here",
    ", we discuss the current drag between two one dimensional wires consisting of classical particles interacting via an unscreened coulomb potential .",
    "the two systems are close enough that they are coupled by the coulomb interaction between the wires .",
    "this system is illustrated in figure  ( [ fig:2wires ] ) .",
    "drives system one .",
    "@xmath3 is the interwire interaction and @xmath4 is the distance of separation . ]",
    "to get an idea of what to expect from such a system we first consider a `` toy model '' consisting of two lines of equally spaced particles interacting via a periodic potential and moving under a viscous drag force .",
    "the main difference between this system and that in figure  ( [ fig:2wires ] ) is that the spacing between particles is fixed so that the internal dynamics of the system are ignored .",
    "the description of such a system has been considered in an analysis by cladis , parks and daniels@xcite in the context of the vortex dynamics in type ii superconductors .    in this analysis ,",
    "two rigid chains of equally spaced particles are taken in the presence of a viscous drag force @xmath5 . since",
    "each chain is rigid , its position can be denoted by the position of one of its particles .",
    "call @xmath6 the position of chain @xmath7 and @xmath8 the position of chain @xmath9 .",
    "the interaction between the two chains is then periodic in @xmath10 and modeled by @xmath11$]@xcite where @xmath12 is the lattice spacing .",
    "in addition , the first chain is driven by a constant force @xmath13 . in",
    "steady state the equations of motion of the two chains are given by    @xmath14 + f\\ ] ]    @xmath15\\ ] ] setting @xmath16 , results in the following equation for the difference between the velocities of the two chains .",
    "@xmath17 with solution @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the time for the two chains to slip one complete cycle ( distance @xmath20 ) .",
    "carrying out the integral results in @xmath21 this simple analysis shows the interesting result that for suitable conditions of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath22 , the two chains will be locked together with the drag current equal to the drive current .",
    "we now wish to investigate the behavior of this classical system when internal dynamics are included .",
    "we take therefore as a model of the dynamics of these classical particles the following fokker - planck equation @xmath23 here , @xmath24 labels the positions of @xmath25 particles in wire @xmath7 , @xmath26 labels the positions of particles in wire @xmath9 , @xmath27 is the diffusion constant and @xmath28 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath29 is then the probability of having the @xmath25 particles in layer @xmath7 at positions @xmath30 and the @xmath25 particles in layer @xmath9 at position @xmath31 at time @xmath32 .",
    "the forces present are @xmath33    in wire @xmath7 and @xmath34 in wire @xmath9 .",
    "the interaction @xmath35 is taken to be the unscreened coulomb interaction between the wires , @xmath36 is the unscreened coulomb interaction within each wire and @xmath13 is a constant force driving the particles in wire @xmath7 .",
    "the basic problem is to determine the drag current produced in wire @xmath9 due to the moving charges in wire @xmath7 .    in the numerical analysis of this problem we performed monte carlo simulations on discrete systems .",
    "the conducting systems are partitioned into a lattice with the particles occupying positions at the lattice points .",
    "the dynamics of the simulation are determined by equation  ( [ eq : fp ] ) which is approximated numerically as follows . for each particle , one of two possible random directions",
    "is chosen .",
    "if the particle lowers its energy by moving one lattice site in that direction , then the move is accepted .",
    "otherwise the move is accepted with probability @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the change in the particles energy upon making this move .",
    "this process is completed iteratively for each particle until a steady state condition is reached .",
    "simulations were performed to determine the dependence of the drag current on separation between the two systems .",
    "the results are shown in figure  ( [ fig:1dplots ] )    the plot of drag current vs. separation shows the fact that the sum of the drive and drag currents is a constant , @xmath40 as can be seen by averaging the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : fp ] ) , ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it also shows that the drag current is significant only when the distance of separation is on the order of the interparticle spacing or smaller .    the main feature of interest in this plot , however , is that the drag current , @xmath42 , is essentially equal in magnitude to the drive current , @xmath0 , at small interwire seperations .",
    "as the separation between the wires is increased the drag current shows a smooth decrease in magnitude .",
    "the main difference between this plot and the toy model ( where internal dynamics are ignored ) is that there does not appear to be an abrupt locking transition .",
    "however at sufficiently large values of the interaction parameter , @xmath22 the two chains are essentially locked together with the drag current equal in magnitude to the drive current .",
    "we will now examine to what extent this classical effect is exhibited in a quantum mechanical system .",
    "in this section we calculate the non - dissipative drag between two perfect wigner crystal rings at zero temperature .",
    "the basics of non - dissipative drag effects has been considered in previous papers  @xcite .",
    "the basic system of interest here consists of two metallic rings one of which is threaded by an ahranov - bohm flux , @xmath43 .",
    "this flux shifts the ground state , @xmath44 , of the ring to a current carrying state which is calculated according to @xmath45 if another ring is brought close to the first one , then the coulomb interaction will cause a drag current to be produced in the second ring . since this is the ground state of the two ring system this",
    "current is non - dissipative and persists as long as the magnetic flux is present in the first ring .    in these",
    "works the two rings have uniform charge densities and the drag effect is due to coupling of charge fluctuations in each ring . in a system with zero disorder ,",
    "the relative magnitude of the drag current produced is typically a small fraction of the driving current . for two such systems separated by a distance @xmath46 the drag",
    "current is on the order of @xmath47 times the current in the driving system .",
    "@xcite based on the analysis of the last section , we expect that the drag current of two wigner crystals could in principle be as large as the driving current .",
    "the model of the one dimensional wigner crystal that we use here is that proposed in references ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) . in this model",
    "the wigner crystal is viewed as an elastic chain of spinless electrons . in the continuum limit",
    ", the wigner crystal of length @xmath48 , in the presence of an ahranov bohm flux , @xmath43 , is described by the lagrangian  @xcite      where @xmath12 is the crystal period , m is the electron mass , s is the velocity of sound in the crystal and @xmath50 is the flux quantum .",
    "the field variable @xmath51 describes the local displacement of the chain at a point @xmath52 at time @xmath32 . if the field variable is expanded in a fourier series @xmath53 we get , @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that the flux will only couple to the zero mode of the ring .",
    "so in dealing with the persistent current of a disorder free wigner crystal ring , the internal dynamics of the ring may be ignored and only the rotation of the ring as a whole is relevant .",
    "we wish to study the interaction between two such wigner crystal rings as shown in figure  ( [ fig : two_rings ] ) .",
    "we take as a model for two disorder free interacting wigner crystal rings the following hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total mass of each ring , @xmath58 represents the strength of the inter - ring interaction , @xmath59 is the flux through ring 1 , @xmath60 is the flux through ring 2 and @xmath61 represents the displacement of ring @xmath62 respectively .",
    "the first two terms in equation  ( [ eq : wc_ringl ] ) represent the individual dynamics of rings @xmath7 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the third term represents the interaction between the two rings .",

    "@xcite    the energy eigenvalues determined in this way , combined with the results of equation  ( [ eq : comh ] ) allow the currents in each ring to be determined from @xmath83 and @xmath84.@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figure  ( [ fig : wigner_jvsq ] ) .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : wigner_jvsq ] ) shows that the drag current does approach the drive current in magnitude as the interaction @xmath58 is increased which is qualitatively similar to the classical result . for large values of the interaction strength , @xmath85 or @xmath86",
    "the two wigner crystals have essentially the same current with each having half the current that one ring would have if isolated .    in order to relate the interaction in equation  ( [ eq : wc_ringl ] ) to the true coulomb interaction we approximate the amplitude @xmath58 as follows .",

    "the long range nature of the coulomb force should be apparent for electron densities , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the bohr radius for the particular ring material.@xcite for a typical mesoscopic ring radius of @xmath100 , crystal lattice constant @xmath101 and @xmath102 we have @xmath103 so the upper limit in the integral in equation  ( [ eq : wc_amplitude ] ) may be taken to infinity which yields @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the zeroth order bessel function .",
    "this implies an exponential decrease in the amplitude of the interaction with increasing separation between the two wigner crystals .",
    "comparison with equation  ( [ eq : lock_cond ] ) shows that the two crystals will be `` locked '' together at a distance @xmath106 .",
    "so two very low density perfect wigner crystals will be essentially locked together when separated by a distance of four times the lattice constant or less .",
    "we now consider the effects of impurities on the dynamics of the wigner crystal . in the presence of an impurity , the phase of the wigner crystal will be pinned . in this case",
    "the crystal ring can not rotate as a whole so the current as presented in the last subsection is not possible .",
    "it was shown , however , by rice et al .",
    "@xcite , that a new type of current is possible , namely the tunneling of solitons through the impurity barrier .",
    "it is the tunneling of solitons that we will investigate in this section .",
    "we are interested in knowing the ratio of the drag current in ring two , to the drive current in ring one .",
    "we therefore take as an assumption the presence of a current in ring one and look for the relative magnitude of the drag current in ring two in the presence of a single impurity .",
    "this system is shown schematically in figure  ( [ fig : two_ringsphase ] ) .",
    "the first two terms in equation  ( [ eq : lagrangewc ] ) are the lagrangians describing the dynamics of rings @xmath7 and @xmath9 respectively .",

    "we follow the work of krive et al .",
    "@xcite and introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath111 which characterizes the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations of the wigner crystal , and the parameter @xmath112 which characterizes the energy scale in a wigner crystal of length @xmath48 .",
    "we will be concerned with stiff crystals that are weakly fluctuating characterized by @xmath113 .",
    "the basic approach that we will use here is a semiclassical approximation used by larkin and lee  @xcite in the context of charge density waves and elaborated by kleinert@xcite for a single particle tunneling through a barrier . in this approach the probability amplitude of a soliton tunneling through an impurity",
    "is given by @xmath114 where @xmath22 is the action associated with the tunneling trajectory obtained by minimizing the function @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the lagrangian , equation  ( [ eq : lagrangewc ] ) , with @xmath32 replaced by the imaginary time @xmath117 .",
    "this approach amounts to approximating the path integral of the propagator by its value at the classical trajectory.@xcite    we now want to answer the following question : given a current in ring @xmath7 that causes a rotation of the phase by @xmath118 , what is the probability that the phase of ring @xmath9 will also rotate by @xmath118 ?",
    "it is apparent that there are three possiblities :          here we have limited our consideration to single tunneling trajectories . in other words , each shift of the phase of each ring occurs due to a single tunneling event and ignore all multistep tunneling trajectories .",
    "thus we only consider strong coupling between rings , @xmath128 , and strong pinning @xmath129 .",
    "we now calculate the tunneling amplitudes for each case above .    in case ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the lagrangian in equation  ( [ eq : lagrangewc ] ) reduces to @xmath130\\ ] ] this is simply the problem of a single wigner crystal ring in the presence of a periodic pinning potential .",

    "a solution to this equation that matches this boundary condition is the soliton / antisoliton solution and has the form @xmath140.\\ ] ] this solution has the following interpretation : at @xmath141 the phase of the crystal is @xmath142 , as @xmath32 increases , the phase at @xmath143 locally increases to @xmath118 creating a region around @xmath143 with phase @xmath118 .",
    "as @xmath32 increases this region with @xmath118 phase propagates symmetrically from @xmath143 at speed @xmath138 towards @xmath144 and @xmath144 until the entire ring is at @xmath145 .",
    "the lagrangian , equation  ( [ eq : lagrangecase1 ] ) has been considered in the context of charge density wave tunneling by bogachek et al .",
    "@xcite , and there it is noted that the homogeneous ( space independent ) soliton solution is advantageous in the action against any spatially dependent solution for a finite system .",
    "the homogenous solution corresponds to a uniform rotation of the wigner crystal as a whole and has the form  @xcite @xmath146 this solution describes the uniform increase of the phase of the entire ring from @xmath142 to @xmath118 in a time @xmath147 .",
    "the action associated with this solution is by equation  ( [ eq : lagrangecase1 ] ) @xmath148^{1/2}\\ ] ]    in case ( @xmath122 ) , the relative difference between the two phases does not increase , while the phase of the center of mass of the two ring system increases by @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that during the tunneling process the two rings remain in phase to minimize the potential energy between them .",
    "if we rewrite equation  ( [ eq : lagrangewc ] ) using @xmath149 and @xmath150 , we get the relevant lagrangian for case ( @xmath122 ) to be        the case of soliton tunneling through an impurity in a strongly pinned charge density wave was first considered by larkin and lee  @xcite . in their analysis ,",
    "the tunneling process is broken into two stages .",
    "the first stage consists of a rapid tunneling of a length @xmath153 of the crystal through the impurity in a short time @xmath154 and leaves the crystal in a distorted state of high potential energy .",
    "the second stage consists of a slow relaxation of the crystal from this distorted state back into a state that minimizes its potential energy .",
    "it is evident that this solution interpolates between the initial state , @xmath158 for all @xmath52 at @xmath141 , and the final state @xmath159 for @xmath143 at @xmath160 .",
    "the second stage of the process takes place away from the impurity @xmath161 and obeys the equation of motion @xmath162 the solution to this stage of the tunneling should obey the periodic boundary conditions of the ring and match the solution for the first stage at @xmath163 .",
    "this problem has been considered in the work of krive et al  @xcite where the proposed trajectory for the relaxation stage has the form @xmath164 the action associated with the tunneling stage of the process is @xmath165 where @xmath166 are constants .",
    "the action associated with the relaxation stage is @xmath167 the length @xmath153 is obtained by minimizing the total action @xmath168 with the result that @xmath169 and @xmath170 where @xmath171 is a constant and @xmath172 is a constant assumed to be of the order unity  @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : actioncase2a ] ) shows the interesting result that the action is only logarithmically dependent on the impurity for strong pinning .    in case ( @xmath125 ) above , the center of mass of the two ring system does not move while the phase of the relative coordinates increases by @xmath173 .",
    "the relevant lagrangian for this system is given by @xmath174 - w\\left[1-\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ]    this is identical to the lagrangian in equation  ( [ eq : lagrangecase2 ] ) with the addition of the term proportional to @xmath175 .",
    "since the probability for this process goes as @xmath176 it is expected that the probability for this case will be reduced relative to that in case ( @xmath122 ) by @xmath177 and can therefore be neglected .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath179 the two crystal will essentially be locked together . for purposes of illustration we consider a stiff crystal with @xmath180 and consider values of @xmath181 for stiff pinning @xmath152 .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : impurity_lock ] ) shows that the impurity effects are not that drastic in determining the value of @xmath175 where the locking of the two crystals occur .",
    "this is due to the fact that the impurity potential enters logarithmically into the tunneling action .",
    "comparison with figure  ( [ fig : wigner_jvsq]b ) shows that the distance at which the two wigner crystals become `` locked '' together is essentially the same as in the impurity free case .",
    "the main effect of the impurity is then in the magnitude of the persistent current .",
    "we can estimate the magnitude of these currents by noting that if the two currents are locked together , then the magnitude of the persistent current for a given flux @xmath43 should be the same as a single wigner crystal ring with twice the mass .",

    "for sufficiently large interaction between rings the drag current is essentially equal in magnitude to the drive current . for an impurity free ring",
    "this `` locking '' of currents occurs at a separation distance of @xmath184 with @xmath12 the crystal period .",
