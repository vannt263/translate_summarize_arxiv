    "the first coronal mass ejection ( cme ) was clearly identified by r. tousey in 1971 @xcite in the _ orbiting solar observatory-7 _ observations . later on cmes",
    "were observed by _",
    "@xcite and since that time have become one of the most interesting topics in solar physics .",
    "it is well known that cmes are associated with flares and eruptive prominences @xcite .",
    "basing on small samples of events @xcite and @xcite showed that the flare - associated cmes are characterized by high velocities ( approximately constant ) and rapid acceleration . on the other hand cmes associated with the prominences",
    "are accelerated over larger height - range and attain lower velocities than flare - associated cmes . using _",
    "soho_/lasco data @xcite separated cmes into two classes : 1 ) gradual cmes with lower speed ( @xmath2@xmath3 km / s ) , associated with eruptive prominences ; 2 ) impulsive cmes with higher speed ( @xmath4 km / s ) , associated with flares and showing clear evidence of deceleration . the existence of two classes of cmes was confirmed by many authors @xcite . however , there are also observations that not confirm differences between the two types of cmes @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented statistical analysis of 545 flare - associated cmes and 104 non - flare cmes .",
    "they demonstrated that both data sets show very similar characteristics : in both samples significant fraction of cmes was accelerated or decelerated and both samples include a comparable ratio of fast and slow cmes .",
    "this directly opposes the concept of two distinct ( flare / non - flare ) classes of cmes . on average , mean cme",
    "velocities gradually decrease , following the sequence : strong - flare events @xmath5 weak - flare events @xmath5 non - flare events with eruptive prominences @xmath5 no - flare / no - prominence events .",
    "@xcite investigated the temporal relationship between cmes and associated solar flares .",
    "they found that kinematic evolution of cmes can be described in three - phase scenario : the initiation phase , the impulsive acceleration phase , and the propagation phase . the impulsive acceleration phase is often synchronized with the rising phase of the associated soft x - ray flare ( @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. , during the flare impulsive phase ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typically , cmes are accelerated over short distance range , usually below the occulting disc of white - light space - borne coronagraphs",
    ". however , sometimes they accelerate up to heights of of several solar radii , in some cases even until the height of 7 @xmath6 @xcite .    during the acceleration phase",
    ", a cme has an acceleration of a few hundred m / s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the value of the acceleration of a cme depends on a duration of the main acceleration phase @xcite .",
    "a fast cme ( @xmath8 km / s ) can be strongly accelerated over short time , or weakly accelerated over an extended time interval of several hours @xcite . since cmes are associated with flares , a duration of the acceleration phase is related to a duration of the rise phase of a flare .",
    "cmes associated with flares of slow rising phase should be accelerated slowly but for a long time .    here , we investigate the kinematic evolution of cmes associated with flares of slow rising phase .",
    "these cmes were accelerated as long as sxr flux of associated flares increased . during the main acceleration phase cmes reached heights @xmath1 , which is a higher value than for a typical cme .",
    "these cmes are characterized by a high velocity during the propagation phase and a low average acceleration during the main , prolongated , acceleration phase .",
    "height - time profiles for the cmes are similar to profiles of cmes associated with eruptive prominences , which means that those cmes may have characteristics both groups of cmes , i.e. cmes associated with flares and cmes associated with eruptive prominences .",
    "we selected five cmes associated with slow ldes .",
    "we were interested only in near - the limb events to avoid projection effects .",
    "basic information about associated slow ldes are given in table [ flares ] .",
    "we determined heights of the cmes ( in the plane of the sky ) using running - differences images from the _ soho_/eit , mlso / mk4 and _",
    "soho_/lasco c2 and c3 instruments .",
    "we fitted second - degree polynomial to the points on the height - time profile to obtain average acceleration during the main acceleration phase .",
