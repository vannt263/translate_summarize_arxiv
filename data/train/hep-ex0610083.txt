    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been observed to be a consistent theory of fundamental particles and their interactions up to the energies they have been studied although one remaining essential ingredient the higgs boson is yet to be discovered .",
    "theoretical considerations teach us that sm can not be the ultimate theory of elementary particles and their interactions . amongst many other compelling theories ,",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) is one of the viable theoretical frameworks which has the potential to overcome some of the short comings of the sm by incorporating minimal supersymmetric particle spectrum .    because of its supersymmetric structure",
    ", the mssm@xcite@xcite requires at least two higgs doublets to generate masses to both `` up''-type and `` down''-type quarks ( and the respective charged leptons ) .",
    "such a two - higgs - doublet model predicts five physical higgs bosons : two cp - even higgs bosons , h and h , one cp - odd higgs bosons , a and a pair of charged higgs bosons , @xmath6 . the mssm higgs sector at the lowest order can fully be described in terms of one higgs boson mass (",
    "@xmath7 is chosen in cp - conserving scenario and @xmath8 in cp - violating scenario ) and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 refers to the higgs field that couples to the `` up''(``down'')-type quarks .",
    "however , additional parameters _ viz . , _",
    "@xmath11 enter at the level of radiative corrections .",
    "it is to be noted that the coupling of the higgs boson a to `` down''-type quark such as bottom quark is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "so with respect to the sm , the production cross section for a in association with bottom quark(s ) gets enhanced by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , at large @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) , there is mass degeneracy between the higgs bosons a and h or h depending on the value of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the total production cross section for mssm neutral higgs bosons _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath16 is twice that of the higgs boson a. previously , lep experiments have set the mass of light higgs boson @xmath17 to be greater than 92.8 gev@xcite at 95% cl .",
    "the mssm neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath18 ) mostly decay into @xmath19 pairs ( 90% ) or into @xmath20 pairs ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "so , at the tevatron @xmath22 and @xmath23 processes are considered to be the most promising channels to look for the signature of mssm neutral higgs bosons . here",
    "we report on the searches for mssm neutral higgs bosons in the above channels performed by the d  experiment @xcite .",
    "the combined results are interpreted in different mssm benchmark scenarios@xcite : `` @xmath24 '' and `` no - mixing '' .",
    "the analysis focuses on mssm neutral higgs boson production in association with one or two bottom quark(s ) resulting in three or four bottom quarks in the final state while , cp - conservation in the higgs sector is assumed .",
    "260 @xmath26 of d   data collected between november 2002 and june 2004 have been utilized for this analysis .",
    "the data are first filtered using a dedicated on line trigger designed to maximize the signal acceptance .",
    "the secondary vertex ( sv ) tagging algorithm has been used to select the b - jets .",
    "the d   sv b - tagging algorithm selects central b - jets ( @xmath27 gev ) with an efficiency of @xmath28 while the mis - tag rate for similar light quark jets is about 1% .    for higgs masses between 90 and 150 gev ,",
    "the @xmath29 signal events have been generated using the pythia  @xcite event generator followed by the full d   detector simulation and reconstruction .",
    "the pythia generated @xmath30 and rapidity spectra of the higgs bosons have been adjusted to those from nlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the largest background contribution from qcd multijet processes have been determined directly from data while contributions from other background processes such as @xmath31 , @xmath32+jets have been determined from monte carlo .",
    "the selected events are required to have at least three b - tagged jets ( within @xmath33 ) with @xmath34 35 , 20 and 15 gev respectively for the leading @xmath30 jets .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the two leading @xmath30 jets in data is then compared with that of the background expectation and no excess has been observed .",
    "[ fig : hbbxsec](a ) shows the limit on the production cross section at 95% cl , as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath35 in `` no mixing '' scenarios .",
    "the results are also interpreted in the `` maximal mixing '' case and the limits in @xmath36 plane for both scenarios are shown in fig .",
