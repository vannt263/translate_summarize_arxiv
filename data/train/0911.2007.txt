    "radio - interferometric image formation requires a solution for both the source brightness distribution over the image field and the interferometric array instrumental and signal propagation effects , estimated jointly from measurements of the electric vector spatial coherence function of the incident radiation field measured on each interferometer baseline ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the coherence data are sparsely sampled , leading to an ill - posed inverse imaging problem that requires regularization for convergent solution @xcite .",
    "this regularization is typically imposed as a constraint on the properties of the source brightness distributions during deconvolution , including positivity and compact support @xcite , or via information or entropy measures @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of the resulting source brightness distribution can not be readily estimated given the analytic intractability of the coupled , non - linear calibration and imaging equation , combined with the fact that the parent probability distribution of the measured spatial coherence function is parametrized by the source brightness distribution and the instrumental array calibration , both unknown a prior at the time of observation . instead ,",
    "achieved image quality is typically estimated heuristically @xcite or by approximate global measures .",
    "common metrics include the ratio of the image brightness root - mean - square ( rms ) measured in regions of low brightness , @xmath0 , to the thermal noise limit , @xmath1 , as calculated for the array from the known antenna sensitivities and receiver and system thermal noise levels , assuming idealized observations of an unresolved point source with perfect array calibration @xcite .",
    "other measures include the achieved dynamic range @xmath2 ( which is not a measure of image fidelity per se ) , expressed as the ratio of the peak brightness , @xmath3 to the off - source rms , @xmath4 @xcite , or the use of the deepest negative in a total intensity image ( where stokes @xmath5 ) to derive a scaling relation to reduce the typical under - estimation of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these gross measures of image quality are however compromised by their idealized underlying assumptions , including that of implied direction - independence of image fidelity across the field . in practice image fidelity",
    "is not constant across the field .",
    "it is direction - dependent ( equivalently , pixel - dependent ) due to residual , unmodeled instrumental calibration errors jointly or separately in the visibility- or image - plane , and the interaction of these residual errors with non - linear deconvolution effects , amongst other factors . as a result ,",
    "the assessment of pixel - dependent image fidelity is a general problem in radio interferometry .",
    "it is not confined to the important problem of calibrating direction - dependent instrumental errors specifically , as described for example by @xcite .    although a challenging and largely unsolved problem , understanding pixel - level radio - interferometric imaging fidelity is essential for current and future telescope arrays .",
    "current instruments need to be made more accessible to the larger astronomical community ; in particular their user base needs to expand beyond those who have invested the substantial time and effort required to acquire expertise in effective radio - interferometric calibration and imaging data reduction processes ( heuristics as summarized for example by @xcite ) .",
    "this is best achieved through the provision of automated pipeline reduction systems ; these require associated estimates of image fidelity to allow effective , broad - based community scientific interpretation and analysis .    for leading - edge future arrays , such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) , solving the problem of quantitative pixel - level image fidelity assessment is key to their effective design .",
    "any interferometer that can not reach its target thermal noise limit in a representative integration needed to meet its key science goals is dynamic - range limited .",
    "this is important for many interferometers but is particularly acute for the ska given its high sensitivity . as a result",
    ", the ska has stringent imaging dynamic range requirements @xcite , particularly in continuum observing modes where @xmath6 will be required routinely across wide image fields in rapid survey modes and @xmath7 for individual , targeted fields .",
    "this dynamic range is not achieved routinely by contemporary radio - interferometric arrays except for the innermost pixels in a handful of images , and then only after extensive custom reduction by the most skilled radio interferometry practitioners .",
    "with increasing projected radial distance from the field center the dynamic range may typically decline by several orders of magnitude , for reasons noted above .",
    "contemporary examples of high dynamic - range and high - sensitivity observations in radio interferometry , and their associated challenges , are provided by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "exponential advances in currently available and anticipated high - performance computing ( hpc ) capabilities and resources @xcite allow fundamentally new approaches to the problem of pixel - level radio - interferometric imaging fidelity assessment .",
    "two complementary approaches have recently been reported : a frequentist statistical resampling method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) and a bayesian imaging technique @xcite . in paper i , we described the first application of statistical bootstrap resampling techniques to the problem of interferometric imaging fidelity assessment .",
    "statistical resampling is an active area in contemporary statistics research @xcite , and general reviews are provided in recent monographs by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in the context of future interferometer arrays , such as",
    "the ska discussed above , the statistical fidelity assessment methods discussed here are particularly important in understanding the optimal design of these telescopes and the contributing factors to their dynamic - range imaging performance . specifically , although resampling methods may prove too computationally expensive for real - time calibration and imaging at a telescope as computationally demanding as the ska , they are very valuable tools during ska design and development .",
    "these methods can also be used in off - line analysis of data from interferometer arrays with smaller numbers of elements and lower associated computational costs for calibration and imaging .",
    "we note that resampling techniques as described here are not strongly sensitive to the specific calibration and imaging algorithm in use ; their goal is instead to provide a measure of the statistical properties of the underlying calibration and imaging estimator .",
    "our initial evaluation in paper i considered fidelity assessment of polarization calibration for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) arrays , a representative radio - interferometric calibration and imaging problem of interest in its own right @xcite .",
    "the statistical performance of both model - based and subsample bootstrap resampling was evaluated by inter - comparison of the bootstrap results with those obtained by direct monte carlo simulation for a single fixed two - component polarized source model and array configuration .",
    "our initial study found both bootstrap resampling techniques to be computationally tractable with modern hpc resources and to have good statistical performance for image variance estimation for the single source model and array configuration considered in that initial study .    in the current paper",
    "we describe results from broader evaluation of the applicability of statistical resampling to radio - interferometric imaging fidelity assessment .",
    "we extend the scope of our original evaluation in paper i by expanding the problem domain along two axes , namely source model structure and array parallactic angle coverage . both parameters vary the expected degree of systematic error in the polarimetric calibration and imaging estimator used in the study and therefore the pixel - level morphology and magnitude of the image fidelity distribution over which the bootstrap resampling methods can be evaluated .    in the expanded evaluation reported here",
    ", we find here that the model - based and sub - sample bootstrap resampling methods for data with long - range statistical dependence , used in paper i , continue to show good statistical performance when applied over a wider range of observing configurations and source models .",
    "we refine guidelines and rules for their general use in radio interferometry and report initial results on their applicability to image bias estimation .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 the theory of bootstrap resampling",
    "is summarized , as applied to the interferometric calibration and imaging problem under examination .",
    "section 3 describes the numerical simulation methods used to measure the statistical performance of the bootstrap resampling techniques under evaluation .",
    "simulation results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 . in section 6",
    ", we summarize the conclusions from the current work .",
    "in this section , we recap the key elements of the statistical resampling method used in the current study for fidelity assessment of interferometric polarization calibration and imaging . a full description of the theory can be found in paper i.      we adopt the radio - interferometric imaging equation developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and generalized for image - plane effects by @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath8 \\int_{\\omega } \\prod_{\\kappa } \\left[t_m^{\\kappa}({\\vec{\\rho } } ) \\otimes t_n^{\\kappa*}({\\vec{\\rho}})\\right ] e^{-2\\pi j \\vec{b}_{mn } \\cdot ( { \\vec{\\rho}}- \\vec{\\rho_s})}\\ k\\ { s({\\vec{\\rho}})}d\\omega \\label{eqn - ie}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 , the term @xmath10 is the measured complex 4-vector of polarization correlations on the baseline @xmath11 between antennas @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( by common convention referred to as visibilities in this discipline ) , @xmath14 is the stokes 4-vector of radio brightness in unit direction @xmath15 , vector @xmath16 is the center of the field @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a constant @xmath19 matrix that maps the stokes parameters @xmath20 into the polarization receptor basis ( e.g. orthogonal circular or linear ) of the visibility polarization correlations .",
    "direction - independent gains of instrumental type @xmath21 at antenna @xmath12 are denoted @xmath22 , with associated direction - dependent gains @xmath23 ; both are @xmath24 jones matrices in the polarization receptor basis , and of arbitrary ( e.g. pixel or functional ) parametrization .",
    "the outer matrix product is denoted by @xmath25 , and complex conjugation by an asterisk .      for the interferometric polarization self - calibration and imaging problem considered here as a representative problem for the study of imaging fidelity assessment",
    ", the imaging equation  [ eqn - ie ] contains only direction - independent jones matrices @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath27 is the null set @xmath28 ( or equivalently , the @xmath29 are identity matrices ) , and where @xmath30 is the jones matrix containing the feed parallactic angle term @xmath31 , known analytically , and @xmath32 is an anti - diagonal matrix containing the antenna - based instrumental polarization leakage terms for each nominally orthogonal polarization receptor basis . as described in paper i , our polarization self - calibration method , as a joint iterative solution for @xmath32 and @xmath14 , is a subset of general self - calibration within the imaging equation framework . for each cycle of ( non - progressive ) iterative refinement of @xmath14 , we solve for the instrumental polarization by minimizing @xmath33 , formed as the @xmath34 complex norm at the position of the unknown @xmath32 in equation  [ eqn - ie ] , by integrating the imaging equation from both the right - hand and left - hand sides to that position .      before considering bootstrap resampling as a technique for imaging fidelity assessment we need to formulate the problem of radio - interferometric calibration and imaging as a statistical inference problem .",
    "general statistical inference and estimation in signal processing is described by @xcite .",
    "the measured visibility dataset , @xmath35 , can be considered a single realization of a vector over time @xmath36 of random variables @xmath37 drawn from a joint , multi - variate parent probability density function ( pdf ) of parametric form @xmath38 .",
    "independent , identically - distributed ( iid ) thermal noise in each visibility measurement is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the joint self - calibration solvers for @xmath40 and @xmath14 as statistical point estimators , denoted @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively . in this standard statistical inference framework ,",
    "the problem of imaging fidelity assessment is that of determining the sampling distribution @xmath43 of @xmath42 . as described in paper i",
    ", this problem is neither tractable analytically , nor is @xmath38 ( or therefore @xmath43 ) known a priori .",
    "statistical resampling offers an alternative inference method for @xmath43 that does not require analytic tractability or detailed knowledge of @xmath38 .",
    "these methods are computationally expensive however , but contemporary advances in hpc capabilities now make them viable approaches .",
    "the single realization of @xmath37 , comprising the observed visibility dataset , can be used to construct an empirical distribution function @xmath44 .",
    "resamples @xmath45 drawn from @xmath44 , conditional on the observed data @xmath46 , and under statistical conditions where the bootstrap is applicable , mirror the statistical relationship between @xmath37 and the unknown parent distribution @xmath38 .",
    "the imaging estimator @xmath42 , is here chosen to represent the estimator for the restored image .",
    "acting on the resampled visibility datasets , this estimator yields images @xmath47 ; their statistical distribution relative to @xmath48 , which is obtained from the @xmath42 acting on the observed ( template ) realization , provides a bootstrap estimate of @xmath43 and hence an assessment of imaging fidelity by our current definition . here the subscript @xmath49 denotes the use of a pixel basis for the images .",
    "radio - interferometric data have long - range statistical dependence and thus require bootstrap innovations developed for dependent data @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we demonstrated the successful use of two such methods , namely the model - based and subsample bootstraps , for a single simulated test case in polarization self - calibration and imaging .",
    "we present an expanded evaluation in the following sections .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the statistical performance of the bootstrap resampling techniques advanced in paper i over a larger domain subset .",
    "we expand the previous study along two axes , namely the expected level of image fidelity and the range of source brightness distribution morphologies considered .",
    "we retain the same interferometric polarization and imaging problem used in paper i as a representative test problem in this discipline .",
    "the details of our polarization self - calibration heuristic is described in detail in paper i ; broadly summarized , this is a joint solver for @xmath14 and @xmath32 over ten non - progressive self - calibration iterations , starting from an unpolarized unit - brightness point source brightness distribution and zero instrumental polarization for each antenna in the array . in the current work , we also retain the the simulated very long baseline array ( vlba ) configuration and instrumental polarization terms enumerated in table 1 of paper i.    to vary the expected image fidelity , we adjust the range of parallactic angle for the simulated array configuration by truncating the simulated observation duration .",
    "the vlba is comprised of antennas with azimuth - elevation antenna mounts which , unlike equatorial mounts , produce non - zero , time - variable feed parallactic angle variations @xcite .",
    "these parallactic angle ranges are labeled as run codes a through f , in order of decreasing parallactic angle range , and are enumerated in table  [ tbl - par ] .",
    "a graphical representation is provided in figure  [ fig - par ] .",
    "run code a is the case of nearly - complete parallactic angle coverage considered as the sole case studied in paper i. interferometric polarization calibration of linearly - polarized calibrators has a higher degree of systematic error for reduced parallactic angle coverage ; this results from the increasing degeneracy introduced between the polarization basis functions @xmath50 and the unknown full - polarization source brightness distribution @xmath14 for low parallactic angle range @xcite .",
    "to vary source polarization morphology , we decrease the angular separation between the two simulated gaussian components used in paper i ( as parametrized in table 2 of paper i ) , so increasing their degree of spatial overlap and hence polarization complexity .",
    "we reproduce the source model in stokes @xmath20 at the original component separation used in paper i in figure  [ fig - true - ad ] , and include the quantitative component parameter values in the caption to that figure .",
    "the component separations used in the current study of source morphology variation are tabulated in table  [ tbl - sep ] in this paper as run codes x , y , and z. for these run codes , however , we retain the same complete parallactic angle range used in paper i , i.e. the same parallactic angle range as run code a in table  [ tbl - par ] .      for each run code \\{a - f ,",
    "x - z } , we assess the statistical performance of each bootstrap resampling method by inter - comparison with results obtained by direct monte carlo simulation . as in paper",
    "i , an ensemble of @xmath51 visibility datasets were generated for each run code by direct monte carlo simulation .",
    "additive iid thermal noise contributions @xmath39 were drawn as a phasor from the complex normal distribution @xmath52 ; this distribution is defined by @xcite . the joint polarization self - calibration and imaging estimator for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ,",
    "was applied to each visibility dataset realization within the monte carlo ensemble generated for each run code .",
    "the bias and mean - squared error ( mse ) of the sampling distribution @xmath43 of @xmath42 were then computed for each restored ensemble image , in a pixel basis @xmath53 , relative to the true source model brightness distribution @xmath54 used to generate the simulated data , the latter convolved with a common median restoring beam matched separately to the spatial resolution of each run code .",
    "the variance was computed as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the sample mean across the ensemble , and the mse per pixel relative to the true model was computed as @xmath57 .",
    "each statistic was computed per image pixel , per self - calibration iteration number , and per stokes parameter @xmath20 .",
    "these monte carlo estimates of the variance , bias , mean , and mse of the sampling distribution @xmath43 of the imaging estimator @xmath42 provide an estimate of truth against which the statistical performance of the bootstrap resampling methods can be assessed .",
    "both the model - based and subsample bootstrap methods described in paper i were used in the current study .",
    "these bootstrap methods are applicable to data with long - term statistical dependence , as is the case in radio interferometry .",
    "the parameters for each bootstrap method , both the model - based ( m1-m4 ) and subsample ( s1-s4 ) bootstrap are reproduced here from paper i as table  [ tbl - mcode ] and table  [ tbl - scode ] respectively .",
    "the reader is referred to paper i for specific implementation details for these bootstrap methods . for each run code",
    "\\{a - f ,  x - z } , a bootstrap ensemble ( of size 256 realizations ) was generated for each separate bootstrap method \\{m1-m4 ,  s1-s4 } by resampling from a single template realization ( here chosen to be either the 127th or 128th of @xmath58 ) taken from the matching monte carlo ensemble for that run code . for each resulting bootstrap ensemble ,",
    "the bias and mse of the sampling distribution of the imaging estimator , @xmath59 were computed from the restored images obtained across the ensemble , @xmath60 , relative to the restored image , @xmath48 , obtained for the template visibility dataset realization .",
    "this technique can be used directly with real data obtained by physical observation , unlike monte carlo simulation , which presupposes knowledge of the unknown true source model .",
    "the primary purpose of this study is to assess if a single observed visibility dataset realization can be used , through resampling , to estimate imaging fidelity , quantified here as the variance , bias , and mse of the sampling distribution @xmath43 of a regularized imaging estimator @xmath42 .",
    "we assess the statistical performance of each bootstrap method in the only practical way , namely against the sampling distribution properties obtained by direct monte carlo simulation .",
    "conclusions regarding the statistical applicability of bootstrap resampling for imaging fidelity obtained in this way translate directly to real observations if the general validity of the approach can be assessed numerically over a sufficiently complete domain subset . as part of that more complete evaluation , for each run code \\{a - f ,  x - z } , we have completed a monte carlo simulation ( denoted by code mc ) and a set of resampling simulations for bootstrap codes \\{m1-m4,s1-s4}.      as in paper i , a modified version of the aips++ package was used to perform polarization self - calibration and imaging , but for the work described in this paper , compiled within the build framework for radio - interferometric analysis software described by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the changes to the code base to support polarization self - calibration and statistical resampling , we also replaced the default @xmath33 newton solver for the imaging equation in the original package with a conjugate - gradient solver as implemented in the optsolve++ package .",
    "the computations were parallelized over visibility dataset realization within each bootstrap or monte carlo ensemble and run on a 32-bit intel xeon linux cluster operated as a national computational resource by the national center for supercomputing applications .",
    "the cluster has a peak single - precision floating point performance per processor of approximately 12 gflops .",
    "each run was typically distributed over 64 processors and ran for @xmath61 3 - 4 hours resulting in an integrated compute cost of @xmath62(tflops ) .",
    "we note as before , however , that the problem is highly parallelizable and scalable over realization and has good load balancing characteristics ; only the template realization and final statistical processing need to be performed in serial segments of the code .",
    "the performance of the polarization self - calibration algorithm in direct monte carlo simulations over run codes \\{a - f } in shown in figure  [ fig - calmse ] ; these run codes have parallactic angle ranges depicted in figure  [ fig - par ] . here",
    "the mse of the instrumental polarization estimator @xmath41 , averaged over antenna and receptor polarization , with reference to the known truth used in the simulations , is separately plotted for each run code against self - calibration iteration number .",
    "the detailed computation of the mse for @xmath41 is described in the caption to figure  [ fig - calmse ] .",
    "as described in preceding sections , the primary purpose of the current work is to assess the statistical performance of the bootstrap resampling techniques advanced in paper i , over an expanded domain subset in this discipline .",
    "this has been achieved by increasing the range of imaging fidelity and source morphologies considered , enumerated by run codes \\{a - f ,  x - z } in tables  [ tbl - par ] and  [ tbl - sep ] . for each run code , a direct monte carlo simulation ( mc ) was performed and bootstrap resampling methods \\{m1-m4 ,  s1-s4 } subsequently applied to a single visibility dataset drawn from each monte carlo ensemble .    for a qualitative assessment of the statistical performance of the bootstrap methods relative to the monte carlo reference",
    ", we plot in figures  [ fig - col - qvar - b ] through [ fig - col - qvar - z ] the pixel - based stokes @xmath63 variance images for the final iteration of polarization self - calibration for a subset of run codes , chosen here to be \\{b , d , x , z } ; these run codes are representative of typical bootstrap statistical performance observed .",
    "we choose stokes _ q _ here as both stokes \\{@xmath64 } show residual calibration errors most clearly for the underlying polarization calibration algorithm . in each of these figures ,",
    "the reference monte carlo variance image is shown in the upper left corner ; the remaining images , in sequential order , are the variance images obtained by bootstrap resampling methods \\{m1-m4 ,  s1-s4}. a default color mapping was used in generating the raster images in these figures ; for each image the same color palette was mapped to the range of pixel data values in the image variance cube resulting from each run ; each cube has axes @xmath65 , stokes parameter @xmath20 , and self - calibration iteration number .",
    "the variance images contain contributions from both calibration and deconvolution errors , as discussed in the introduction .    for a quantitative assessment of bootstrap statistical performance we use a similar goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath66 , to",
    "that defined in paper i to compare the variance image obtained using a given bootstrap resampling method , @xmath67 , to the the reference variance image obtained by monte carlo simulation , @xmath68 . in the current work , the statistic is computed over the inner quarter of the image , all stokes parameters @xmath20 , and all self - calibration iteration numbers @xmath69 , as :    @xmath70    were @xmath71 is the variance scaling factor @xcite .",

    "the optimal bootstrap methods are therefore indicated in this table by unit relative @xmath66 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath66 given in table 5 of paper i were incorrectly scaled in absolute magnitude and need to be multiplied by a factor @xmath72 for comparison with the @xmath66 values in the current work .    in figures  [ fig - qvar - abc ] through [ fig - qvar - xyz ]",
    "we plot the pixel - based stokes @xmath63 variance for the final polarization self - calibration iteration for each run code \\{a - f ,  x - z } for both the direct monte carlo reference simulation and the optimal model - based and subsample bootstrap methods identified in table  [ tbl - vmse ] . in these figures ,",
    "the stokes @xmath63 variance images are drawn as contour plots with identical fractional contour levels in each figure sub - panel .",
    "the results presented in the previous section show that the applicability of statistical resampling as a tool for imaging fidelity assessment in radio interferometry is upheld from our initial evaluation presented in paper i , when explored over a larger domain subset , here a greater range of expected image fidelity and source brightness distribution morphology .",
    "the current work continues to support the conclusion that contemporary statistical resampling techniques developed for data with long - range statistical dependence @xcite are a promising method for estimating the statistical properties of regularized calibration and imaging estimators used for the solution of the imaging equation  [ eqn - ie ] in radio interferometry .",
    "the technique also intrinsically allows an estimate of image quality per pixel , in contrast to coarser direction - independent metrics , such as those based on off - source rms @xmath0 for example . as a bootstrap technique ,",
    "it is also not sensitive to assumptions about the functional form or parametrization of the parent pdf of the measured visibility data , and does not require the frequent idealization of uniform gaussianity for the total noise contribution .",
    "as described in the preceding section , we assess each bootstrap method quantitively against the direct monte carlo variance reference image ; this goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath66 is tabulated in table  [ tbl - vmse ] .",
    "an optimal bootstrap method , within a given set , is the method that agrees most closely with the monte carlo result by this quantitative measure .",

    "the subsample bootstrap performance drops precipitously for low or moderate delete fraction @xmath74 and the optimal subsample bootstrap code is found to be s4 consistently across all run codes \\{a - f ,  x - z } in the current study .",
    "the subsample delete fraction for bootstrap code s4 is 0.75 , the highest value of @xmath73 amongst the bootstrap codes \\{s1-s4}. despite the poorer statistical performance of the subsample bootstrap , we note that it has the advantage of ease of implementation and requires no free user - adjustable parameters if a fixed value @xmath75 is adopted .",

    "the optimality of m4 over m3 for run codes \\{x - z } is consistent with the more compact source morphology for these run codes , as noted in table  [ tbl - sep ] , and therefore a lower mean rate of change of source visibility over time . as shown in table  [ tbl - vmse ] , the relative performance of the model - based bootstrap shows a weak dependence on @xmath77 , compared to the strong dependence of the subsample bootstrap performance on the delete fraction @xmath73 . in this sense",

    "we find empirically in the current study that a function of the form @xmath81 provides a better fit to the data ( either separately for each run code or jointly across all run codes ) than @xmath82 or @xmath83 , although we stress that the current data do not statistically rule out these models .",
    "further studies with a finer sampling in @xmath73 are planned to constrain this relation more closely .",
    "additional work will also be required to determine its broader applicability ; this is an empirical relation in its current form .",
    "a joint best fit across run code \\{a - f ,  x - z } is drawn as a solid line in figure  [ fig - vf - scale ] in the form :    @xmath84    the subset of runs comprising the direct monte carlo simulations over parallactic angle ranges \\{a - f } provide an opportunity to study the performance of the polarization self - calibration algorithm introduced in paper i. the total mse for the estimator @xmath41 , averaged over antenna and polarization receptor basis , is plotted on a logarithmic scale against self - calibration iteration number in figure  [ fig - calmse ] . as noted , and demonstrated , in paper i , the algorithm is expected , from relative information arguments , to demonstrate rapid convergence for the case of good parallactic angle coverage .",
    "the current study measures the algorithm performance for decreasing parallactic angle range over run codes \\{a - f}. figure  [ fig - calmse ] shows that there is good convergence for parallactic angle ranges @xmath85 that include source transit , moderate convergence for @xmath86 , and poor convergence for @xmath87 .",

    "these example images are selected for their expected high levels of bias , as anticipated in the current study for the case of stokes @xmath89 images at low polarization self - calibration iteration numbers , where the instrumental polarization terms will still have high mse . as for the variance study",
    ", we assess the statistical performance of the bootstrap resampling estimate of bias against the result obtained by direct monte carlo simulation .",

    "however , we note that our preliminary experience is that they have lower statistical performance than variance estimators . @xcite",
    "discuss the performance of bootstrap bias estimators , and propose techniques that can significantly improve their statistical performance .",
    "we intend to examine bias estimation in this application in more detail in a future paper .",
    "we also note that new statistical imaging techniques of the type considered in this paper allow novel approaches to understanding direction - dependent radio - interferometric calibration and imaging fidelity , especially those challenges posed by wide - field imaging at uniform , high dynamic range , as needed for future leading - edge telescopes such as the ska . these techniques offer a new approach , distinct from instrument simulation which has well - known limitations , to derive direction - dependent imaging fidelity assessments from single observations with real prototype arrays .",
    "the computational cost of the bootstrap resampling techniques evaluated here is approximately @xmath90 times the processing cost for a single dataset without resampling .",
    "this places it well within contemporary hpc resources at the teraflop scale and those projected to be available soon in the petascale era @xcite . the cost of the algorithm is strongly mitigated by its high degree of scalability and effective parallel decomposition .",
    "we draw the following conclusions from the current evaluation of bootstrap resampling for radio - interferometric imaging fidelity assessment over a broader domain subset :    1 .",
    "statistical resampling techniques for dependent data remain a promising approach to the important problem of pixel - level fidelity assessment in radio - interferometric calibration and imaging .",
    "they show good statistical performance as assessed against direct monte carlo simulation , and are computationally affordable and scalable on contemporary and future hpc resources .",
    "they have the desirable statistical properties of independence on the detailed functional form or parametrization of the parent pdf of the observed visibility data and of not requiring an analytic solution for the calibration and imaging inference problem .",
    "model - based bootstrap techniques outperform subsampling bootstrap methods in general in our study , although both are of value in this application .",
    "the subsample bootstrap performs well for delete fraction @xmath91 , is straight - forward to implement , and has no adjustable parameters if @xmath73 is adopted as this value .",
    "the model - based bootstrap has superior statistical performance in general .",
    "it has free parameters @xmath92 that can in principle be deduced from the observed data and against which the method is relatively robust to the exact values used .",
    "the subsample bootstrap variance scaling relation @xmath93 measured in the current study shows relatively limited variability across the broader domain subset considered here .",
    "the current data are consistent with an exponential function : @xmath94 .",
    "the polarization self - calibration algorithm introduced in paper i is found to converge at a faster than exponential rate for good parallactic coverage @xmath95 .",
    "its performance for lower parallactic angle ranges is found to deteriorate for @xmath96 and to break down in the limit as @xmath97 as expected .",
    "an initial examination of statistical resampling for bias estimation shows qualified promise in the high - bias regime in this discipline , but further evaluation is required .",
