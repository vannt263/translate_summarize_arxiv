    "the collapse of protostellar cores lead to the development of a central mass or protostar , surrounded by a disc of material , which is accreted towards the center . during this process angular momentum",
    "is transferred to a small percentage of disc material at large radii , enabling the collapse of most of the disc towards the central star ( e.g. weintraub , sandell & duncan 1989 ; adams , emerson & fuller 1990 ; beckwith et al .",
    "the evolution of this ` disc accretion ' phase is dependent upon the rate of angular momentum transport in the disc ( e.g. adams & lin 1993 ) .    a variety of mechanisms",
    "have been invoked to explain this transport .",
    "as the molecular viscosity of accretion discs is too low to explain observed accretion rates ( pringle 1981 ) , some form of turbulent viscosity must be present .",
    "the origin and characteristics of this turbulence remains an important problem in star formation theories .",
    "convective turbulence has been considered as an option ( lin & papaloizou 1980 ) , but further studies suggest that this mechanism may transport angular momentum towards the central star instead of away from it ( cabot & pollack 1992 ; ryu & goodman 1992 ; stone & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "the gravitational field of a companion star may trigger hydrodynamic waves which can transport angular momentum ( vishniac & diamond 1989 ; rozyczka & spruit 1993 ) , but as a significant fraction of stars do not belong to binary systems , this mechanism is not general enough to explain accretion processes in all stars .",
    "balbus and hawley have pointed out that the nature of this anomalous viscosity can be hydromagnetic ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; hawley & balbus 1991 ; stone et al .",
    "this ` magnetorotational ' instability ( mri ) had been described initially by velikov ( 1959 ) and chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) through their analysis of magnetised couette flows .",
    "it drives turbulent motions which transport angular momentum radially outwards , as fluid elements exchange angular momentum non - locally by means of the distortion of the magnetic field lines that connect them .    under ideal mhd conditions , mri perturbations",
    "grow in discs that are differentially rotating , with the angular velocity increasing outwards .",
    "axisymmetric modes need a magnetic field with a weak , poloidal component . in this context , ` weak ' means that the magnetic energy density of the field is less than the thermal energy density .",
    "these perturbations have a characteristic length scale @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the alfvn speed and @xmath2 is the keplerian angular frequency in the disc , and a maximum growth rate @xmath3 , with @xmath4 for keplerian discs ( balbus & hawley 1992a ) .",
    "this growth rate does not depend on the strength or direction of the magnetic field as long as a poloidal component is present .",
    "non - axisymmetric perturbations are most unstable under the influence of a poloidal field , but also grow at a reduced rate if the field is purely toroidal ( balbus & hawley 1992b ) .",
    "these perturbations are of interest for the analysis of field amplification mechanisms , as dynamo amplification can not occur through axisymmetric perturbations ( moffatt 1978 ) . with no strong dissipation processes ,",
    "no other conditions are required . because of its robustness and the general conditions under which it develops , the magnetorotational instability is a promising source of turbulent viscosity in accretion discs .",
    "ideal mhd conditions are a good approximation to model astrophysical systems where the ionisation fraction of the gas is high enough to ensure neutral and ionised components of the fluid are well coupled .",
    "active dwarf novae ( except possibly in the outer regions ) and black hole accretion discs are examples of such systems . however , in dense , cool environments such as those of protostellar discs , it is doubtful that magnetic coupling is significant over the entire radial and vertical dimensions of the discs ( gammie 1996 ; wardle 1997 ) .",
    "similar conditions are thought to apply in quiescent and the outer regions of hot - state dwarf novae discs ( gammie & menou 1998 ; menou 2000 ; stone et al . 2000 ) . in these cases ,",
    "low conductivity significantly affects the growth and structure of mri perturbations .",
    "different approximations have been adopted to account for the departure from ideal mhd in low conductivity astrophysical discs ( see section [ subsec : governing ] ) .",
    "most models of the mri in low conductivity discs have used the ambipolar diffusion ( blaes & balbus 1994 ; maclow et al .",
    "1995 ; hawley & stone 1998 ) or resistive ( jin 1996 ; balbus & hawley 1998 ; sano , inutsuka & miyama 1998 ) limits .",
    "recently , it has been recognised the importance of the hall conductivity terms in addition to resistivity for the analysis of low conductivity discs ( wardle 1999 , hereafter w99 , balbus & terquem 2001 and sano & stone 2002a , b ; 2003 ) .",
    "the huge variation of fluid variables over the vertical and radial extension of astrophysical discs is a further complication .",
    "vertical stratification is particularly relevant , as these objects are generally thin and changes in the plane of the disc are much more gradual than those in the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "previous models of the mri have not included density stratification and hall conductivity simultaneously .",
    "it is expected that solutions will be strongly modified when both factors are present .",
    "this motivates the present study .",
    "this paper examines the structure and linear growth of the magnetorotational instability in vertically stratified , non self - gravitating accretion discs .",
    "we assume the disc is isothermal and geometrically thin , so variations in the fluid variables in the radial direction can be ignored .",
    "the initial magnetic field is vertical and the analysis is restricted to perturbations with wavevector perpendicular to the plane of the disc ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these are the most unstable perturbations with the adopted field geometry , as magnetic pressure strongly supresses displacements with @xmath6 ( balbus & hawley 1991 , sano & miyama 1999 ) . the conductivity of the gas is treated as a tensor and assumed constant with height in this initial study , although the formulation is also valid for a @xmath7-dependent conductivity .",
    "this makes the present method a powerful tool for the analysis of more realistic discs ( see section [ sec : discussion ] - discussion ) .",
    "section [ sec : formulation ] presents the governing equations for a weakly ionised , magnetised disc in near - keplerian motion around the central star and details the adopted disc model .",
    "section [ sec : linearisation ] summarises the linearisation of the equations and presents the final linear system in dimensionless form .",
    "it also describes the three parameters that control the dynamics of the fluid .",
    "section [ sec : boundary conditions ] discusses the boundary conditions used to integrate the equations from the midplane to the surface of the disc and the integration method .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the test cases used to characterise the conductivity regimes relevant for this work and compares our results with a previous local analysis .",
    "it also details key findings on the dependency of the structure and growth rate of the perturbations with the conductivity regime , the strength of the magnetic field and its coupling with the neutral gas .",
    "these results are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] . by way of example",
    ", this section also calculates the structure and growth rate of the mri under fluid conditions where different conductivity regimes are dominant at different heights above the midplane .",
    "this reflects ( qualitatively ) the conditions expected to be found in real discs .",
    "finally , the methodology and key findings of this paper are summarised in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the equations of non - ideal mhd are written about a local keplerian frame corotating with the disc at the angular frequency @xmath2 associated with the particular radius of interest .",
    "consequently , the velocity of the fluid can be expressed as a departure from exact keplerian motion @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the velocity in the standard laboratory coordinate system @xmath10 anchored at the central mass @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the keplerian velocity at the radius @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath14 is the time derivative in the local keplerian frame , then the time derivative in the laboratory frame can be expressed as @xmath15 .",
    "we also assume that the fluid is weakly ionised , meaning that the abundances of charged species are so low that their inertia and thermal pressure , as well as the effect of ionisation and recombination processes in the neutral gas , are negligible .",
    "these assumptions effectively restrict the range of frequencies that can be studied with this formulation to be smaller than the collision frequency of any of the charged species with the neutrals . accordingly ,",
    "separate equations of motion for the charged species are not required and their effect on the neutrals is contained in a conductivity tensor ( see section [ subsec : conductivity ] ) .",
    "the governing equations are the continuity equation ,    @xmath16    the equation of motion ,    @xmath17    and the induction equation ,    @xmath18    in the equation of motion ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , @xmath19 is the gravitational potential due to the central gas , given by    @xmath20    and @xmath21 is the centripetal term generated by exact keplerian motion . at the disc midplane",
    "this term balances the radial component of the gravitational potential .",
    "the terms @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the coriolis terms associated with the use of a local keplerian frame , @xmath24 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath25 is the keplerian frequency and @xmath26 is the speed of light .",
    "other symbols have their usual meanings .    in the induction equation ( [ eq : induction ] )",
    ", the term @xmath27 contains the effects of non - ideal mhd .",
    "@xmath28 is the electric field in the frame comoving with the neutrals and the term @xmath29 accounts for the generation of toroidal field from the radial component due to the differential rotation of the disc .",
    "additionally , the magnetic field must satisfy the constraint :    @xmath30    and the current density must satisfy ampere s law ,    @xmath31    and ohm s law ,    @xmath32    note that the conductivity , which depends on the abundance and drifts of the charged species through the neutral gas is treated as a tensor @xmath33 , as detailed in the following section .",
    "this formulation is compared to the drift velocity approach in section [ subsec : multifluid ] .",
    "the electric conductivity is a tensor whenever the gyrofrequency of the charged carriers is larger than the frequency of momentum exchange by collisions with the neutrals , or @xmath34 ( cowling 1957 , norman & hayvaerts 1985 , nakano & umebayashi 1986 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "when collisions with the neutrals are dominant the conductivity is a scalar , the ordinary ohmic resistivity .",
    "to obtain expressions for the components of this tensor , we begin by writing down the equations of motion of the ionised species . as inertia and thermal pressure",
    "are neglected , the motion of the charged particles is given by the balance of the lorentz force and the drag force from collisions with the neutrals ,    @xmath35    where each charged species @xmath36 is characterised by its number density @xmath37 , particle mass @xmath38 , charge @xmath39 and drift velocity @xmath40 . in the above equation ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the mean mass of the neutral particles and @xmath43 is the rate coefficient of momentum exchange by collisions with the neutrals .",
    "we will also make use of the hall parameter ,    @xmath44    given by the ratio of the gyrofrequency and the collision frequency of charged species @xmath36 with the neutrals .",
    "it represents the relative importance of the lorentz and drag terms in equation ( [ eq : drift ] ) .    following the treatment of wardle & ng ( 1999 ) and w99 we use the following expression for ohm s law ,    @xmath45    obtained by inverting ( [ eq : drift ] ) to express @xmath40 as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath46 and then using @xmath47 together with the charge neutrality assumption @xmath48 . in equation ( [ eq : j - e ] ) ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the components of the electric field @xmath28 , parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the components of the conductivity tensor @xmath33 are the conductivity parallel to the magnetic field ,    @xmath51    the hall conductivity ,    @xmath52    and the pedersen conductivity ,    @xmath53    the relative values of the components of the conductivity tensor differentiate three conductivity regimes :    1 .",
    "the _ ambipolar diffusion _ regime occurs when @xmath54 , or @xmath55 for most charged species .",
    "this implies that most charged particles are strongly tied to the magnetic field by electromagnetic stresses .",
    "this regime is dominant at relatively low densities , where the magnetic field is frozen into the ionised component of the fluid and drifts with it through the neutrals .",
    "the linear behaviour of the mri in this regime has been analysed by blaes & balbus ( 1994 ) and the non - linear growth by maclow et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and hawley & stone ( 1998 ) .",
    "the _ resistive ( ohmic ) _ regime is obtained when most charged species are linked to the neutrals via collisions .",
    "this occurs when @xmath56 , implying @xmath57 .",
    "this regime is predominant closest to the midplane , where the high density makes the collision frequency of the charged particles with the neutrals high enough to prevent the former from drifting .",
    "this case has been studied under a linear approximation by jin ( 1996 ) , balbus & hawley ( 1998 ) , papaloizou & terquem ( 1997 ) , sano & miyama ( 1999 ) and sano et .",
    "the non - linear regime has been studied by sano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; fleming , stone & hawley ( 2000 ) and stone & fleming , ( 2003 ) .",
    "this last work includes a @xmath7-dependent resistivity .",
    "3 .   finally , the _ hall _ regime occurs when charged particles of one sign are tied to the magnetic field while those of the other sign follow the neutrals . in this case @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is important at intermediate densities , between the ones associated with the ambipolar and ohmic difussion regimes .",
    "recent studies have explored the mri with hall effects in the linear ( w99 , balbus & terquem 2001 ) and non - linear regimes ( sano & stone 2002a , b ; 2003 ) .",
    "another commonly used form of the induction equation is obtained by assuming that ions and electrons are the main charge carriers and drift through the neutrals ( e.g balbus & terquem 2001 , sano & stone 2002 ) . using this approach ,",
    "the induction equation is    @xmath60",

    "the four terms in the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : induction_drift ] ) are , from left to right , the inductive , resistive , hall and ambipolar diffusion terms .",
    "we now express equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) in terms of @xmath65 , @xmath46 and the components of the conductivity tensor in order to show that , in the appropriate limit , it corresponds to equation ( [ eq : induction_drift ] ) , as expected .",
    "we begin by inverting equation ( [ eq : j - e ] ) to find an expression for @xmath28 ,    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the total conductivity perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "assuming that the only charged species are ions and electrons with hall parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , respectively , and that charge neutrality is satisfied ( @xmath71 ) , we obtain the following expressions for the components of the conductivity tensor :    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    from ( [ eq : sig1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sig2 ] ) , we find :    @xmath75^{1/2 } } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sigperp}\\ ] ]    substituting these expressions into ( [ eq : e - j ] ) gives    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the electrical conductivity due to electrons .",
    "finally , simplifying ( [ eq : e - j2 ] ) by using @xmath78 ( as is the case ) and substituting the resulting @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) ( without the coriolis term ) , yields the standard result , shown in ( [ eq : induction_drift ] ) .",
    "each of the last three terms in the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : induction_drift ] ) dominate when the fluid is in a particular conductivity regime ( section [ subsec : conductivity ] ) .",
    "these limits can also be recovered with the appropriate assumptions , through equations ( [ eq : e - j ] ) and ( [ eq : e - j2 ] ) . to get the resistive regime , for example",
    ", we substitute @xmath79 and @xmath80 into equation ( [ eq : e - j ] ) . in this",
    "limit the conductivity is a scalar ( the resistive approximation ) , so @xmath81 and the induction equation reduces to the familiar form ,    @xmath82\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : induction_3}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , to model the hall limit , we regard the charged species to be either ` ions ' , which are strongly tied to the neutrals through collisions ( @xmath83 ) , or ` electrons ' , for which the only important forces are electromagnetic stresses ( @xmath84 ) ( see also discussion in w99 ) . in this limit",
    "the hall conductivity is    @xmath85    while the pedersen conductivity is    @xmath86    as the ions are effectively locked with the neutrals , the current density will be given by the drift of the electrons through the neutral gas .",
    "collisions are unimportant in their equation of motion , so they drift perpendicular to the plane of the electric and magnetic fields , in order to annul the lorentz force acting upon them . in this limit @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "consistent with the hall term in equation ( [ eq : induction_drift ] ) .",
    "finally , the ambipolar diffusion approximation is recovered by assuming @xmath89 , @xmath79 and @xmath90 . in this limit",
    ", the pedersen conductivity is given by    @xmath91    @xmath92    which originates the ambipolar diffusion term of ( [ eq : induction_drift ] ) .",
    "although the multifluid drift and conductivity tensor formulations are ultimately equivalent , which one is more convenient depends on the problem at hand . in particular ,",
    "the presence of dust grains tends to make the treatment of different species especially complex . in protostellar discs",
    ", dust grains can be the more abundant charged species over extended regions .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath93 grains , negatively charged grains dominate whenever @xmath94 @xmath95 , while positive charged grains are the most abundant ions for @xmath96 @xmath95 ( wardle & ng 1999 ) .",
    "having separate equations of motion for different charged species would generally involve dividing the grain size distribution of interest into an appropriate number of discrete intervals and explicitly treating each one . unless the number of such intervals is small it is easy to see that this method can become very cumbersome .",
    "in these circumstances , incorporating the contribution of each charged species into a conductivity tensor can be a valuable approach .",
    "our model incorporates the vertical structure of the disc , but neglects fluid variations in the radial direction .",
    "this is appropriate as astrophysical accretion discs are generally thin and changes in the radial direction occur in a much bigger length scale than those in the vertical direction . including the vertical structure means that perturbations of spatial dimensions comparable to the scale height of the disc , which are associated with a strong magnetic field ( @xmath97 ) , or low conductivity , can be explored .",
    "the balance between the vertical component of the central gravitational force and the pressure gradient within the disc determines its equilibrium structure .",
    "the vertical density distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium is given by    @xmath98    in the above equation , @xmath99 is the gas density at the midplane and @xmath100 is the scaleheight of the disc .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of this problem , would involve adopting a particular dependency of @xmath101 and @xmath102 with @xmath13 using a suitable model , such as the minimum solar nebula ( hayashi , nakazawa & nakagawa 1985 ) and calculating @xmath103 by means of ( [ eq : rhoinitial ] ) .",
    "this density , together with the adopted strength of the magnetic field @xmath104 and the values of the conductivity tensor @xmath33 as a function of height would be used to evaluate the parameters that govern the fluid evolution ( see section [ subsec : parameters ] ) and solve the fluid equations .    the realistic evaluation of the conductivity tensor is a complex undertaking , as it depends critically on the abundances of charged species ( ions , electrons and charged dust grains ) which , in turn , are a function of the ionisation balance in the disc .",
    "this balance is given by the equilibrium between ionisation processes by cosmic rays , radioactive elements and x - rays from the central star ( e.g. hayashi 1981 ; glassgold , najita & igea 1997 , igea & glassgold 1999 ; fromang , terquem & balbus 2002 ) and recombinations taking place both in the gas phase and in grain surfaces ( e.g. nishi , nakano & umebayashi 1991 ) .",
    "in low conductivity discs , the level of ionisation is insufficient to produce good coupling between the magnetic field and the neutral component of the fluid over their entire vertical structure . in protostellar discs , for example",
    ", it is expected that in the region outside @xmath105 au from the central star , the coupling will be significant only in the surface layers , where x - rays and cosmic rays can penetrate and ionise the gas ( gammie 1996 ; wardle 1997 ) . in these environments ,",
    "the @xmath7-dependent atenuation of the ionisation rate typical of interstellar space @xmath106 @xmath107 has to be taken into account .    on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of dust grains to recombination processes is particularly complex , because they generally have a distribution of sizes and corresponding collision cross sections ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ; umebayashi & nakano 1990 ) .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of grain particles depends on the activity of the disc . in quiescent environments",
    ", they tend to settle towards the midplane and begin to agglomerate into bigger structures that could eventually become planets ( e.g. weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) .",
    "this removes grains from regions at relatively high @xmath7 and causes the ionisation level to increase by reducing recombination processes taking place in their surfaces .",
    "simulations of the evolution of dust grain distributions in dense cores show that they grow icy mantles and coagulate efficiently ( ossenkopf 1993 ) . by this process , the smallest particles grow quickly while the upper grain size limit is only slightly changed ( ossenkopf 1993 ) . as a result ,",
    "the surface area of dust grains can be significantly modified by grain evolution , which ultimately affects the ionisation balance in the disc .    in the present work , a simpler treatment has been adopted . in order to study the mri under different conductivity regimes , the values of the components of the conductivity tensor",
    "have been selected so that they satisfy the conditions outlined in section [ subsec : conductivity ] for each regime . for simplicity",
    ", these values are assumed to be constant , although the formulation allows them to be a function of height .",
    "we found that the parameters that control the evolution of the fluid are the ratio of the components of the conductivity tensor perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath108 ) , the strength of the magnetic field and its degree of coupling with the neutral component of the fluid ( see section [ subsec : parameters ] ) .",
    "the midplane values of these parameters have been selected in order to simulate the fluid conditions we were interested in modelling .",
    "this approach will be discussed in section [ subsec : test ] where the chosen test cases are detailed .    with this approach",
    "we are able to study the dependency of the growth rate and structure ( characterised by the height of maximum amplitude and the wavenumber of unstable modes ) of the instability with the parameters of the fluid in a stratified disc .",
    "this is relevant , as the region where linear perturbations peak is also expected to be the region where non - linear perturbations grow fastest , until turbulence finally sets in and causes all wavenumbers to interact so that , eventually , the longest wavelengths carry the greatest angular momentum transport ( e.g. hawley & balbus 1995 ) .",
    "we linearised the system of equations ( [ eq : continuity ] ) - ( [ eq : induction ] ) , ( [ eq : j_curlb ] ) and ( [ eq : j - e ] ) about an initial steady state where @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in the initial state",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath65 vanish , so the changes in the conductivity tensor due to the perturbations do not appear in the linearised equations . as a result , it is not necessary to explore how the perturbations affect the conductivity and only the values in the initial steady state are required .",
    "we assume the wavevector of the perturbations is perpendicular to the plane of the disc ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "perturbations with a vertical wavenumber , initiated from a vertically aligned equilibrium magnetic field , exhibit the fastest growth rate for a given set of parameters because magnetic pressure strongly suppresses displacements with @xmath6 ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; sano & miyama 1999 ) . taking perturbations of the form @xmath112 about the initial state , linearising and neglecting terms of order @xmath113 or smaller , we find that the equations decouple into two subsystems .",
    "one of them corresponds to sound waves propagating in the vertical direction and the other describes mhd perturbations in the plane of the disc , with vanishing @xmath7 component .    with these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "the final linear system of equations that describes the mhd perturbations within the disc is ,    @xmath114    @xmath115    @xmath116    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the perturbations of the electric field in the laboratory frame , given by    @xmath124    @xmath125    we note that @xmath126 , the component of the conductivity tensor parallel to the magnetic field , does not appear in the final linearised equations .",
    "because the ambipolar diffusion and resistive conductivity regimes are differentiated by the value of @xmath126 ( section [ subsec : conductivity ] ) , this means that during the linear stage of the mri , under the adopted approximations , these regimes are identical .",
    "equations ( [ eq : motion_r_final ] ) to ( [ eq : er_v ] ) can be expressed in dimensionless form , normalising the variables as follows :    @xmath127    @xmath128    @xmath129    subscript ` o ' is used to denote variables at the midplane of the disc . effecting these changes and dropping the asterisks to keep the notation simple ,",
    "we finally express the dimensionless system of equations in matrix form as :    @xmath130    @xmath131    @xmath132    @xmath133    where    @xmath134    @xmath135    @xmath136^{-1 } \\",

    "further , hall diffusion will modify any angular momentum transport within the dead zone that occurs via non - axisymmetric density waves driven by the active surface layers ( stone & fleming 2003 ) because it will dominate the marginally magnetically - active regions of the disc just above the dead zone .",

    "in this paper we have examined the structure and linear growth of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in weakly ionised , stratified accretion discs , assuming an initially vertical magnetic field .",
    "this work is relevant for the study of low - conductivity accretion systems , such as protostellar and quiescent dwarf novae discs , where non - ideal mhd effects are important ( gammie & menou 1998 ; menou 2000 ; stone et al .",
    "the formulation allows for a height - dependent conductivity but in this initial study we assumed the components of the conductivity tensor were constant with height .",
    "the analysis was restricted to perturbations with a vertical wavevector ( @xmath111 ) , which are the most unstable modes when initiated from a vertically aligned magnetic field ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; sano & miyama 1999 ) . in this case",
    ", the field - parallel component of the conductivity tensor plays no role and the ambipolar diffusion and resistive limits are identical .",
    "the linearised system of ode was integrated from the midplane to the surface of the disc under appropriate boundary conditions and global unstable modes were obtained .",
    "the parameters that control the evolution of the fluid are : ( _ i _ ) the coupling between ionised and neutral components of the fluid evaluated at the midplane ( @xmath158 ) , which relates the frequency at which non - ideal effects are important with the dynamical ( keplerian ) frequency of the disc ; ( _ ii _ ) the magnetic field strength characterised by the ratio @xmath156 at the midplane ; and ( _ iii _ ) the ratio of the components of the conductivity tensor perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath108 .    in order to explore the growth and structure of unstable modes when different conductivity regimes dominate over the entire cross - section of the disc",
    ", we examined the following configurations of the conductivity tensor : @xmath273 ( the ambipolar diffusion or resistive limits ) , @xmath296 ( both hall limits @xmath184 and @xmath209 ) , and the cases where both effects are important ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "the main results of this study are highlighted below :    1 .",
    "global modes are a discrete subset from the continuous curve of possible @xmath179 vs. @xmath180 combinations obtained with a local analysis ( w99 ) .",
    "these unstable modes can be expressed as a superposition of two wkb modes with similar growth rate , which explains the interference patterns found in some of the perturbations .",
    "2 .   ambipolar diffusion perturbations peak consistently higher above the midplane than solutions where hall conductivity dominates .",
    "3 .   for good coupling ( @xmath297 ) , the structure and growth of the perturbations",
    "are mainly determined by ambipolar diffusion . for a weaker coupling ,",
    "hall conductivity significantly modifies unstable modes . in this case ,",
    "@xmath295 perturbations resemble the hall @xmath184 limit and peak closer to the midplane while @xmath202 modes have their maximum amplitude closer to the surface .",
    "hall limit ( @xmath209 ) perturbations can have a complex structure ( high wavenumber ) even for poor coupling ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "there are also many unstable modes , which supports findings that in this case the mri evolves into mhd turbulence with non - emergence of the two - channel flow obtained in other regimes ( sano & stone 2002a , 2002b ) . 5 .   as the coupling parameter @xmath158",
    "is reduced , departure from ideal growth @xmath298 occurs at a rate that depends on the conductivity regime .",
    "hall limit perturbations grow at close to the ideal limit for @xmath299 . in the ambipolar diffusion approximation the growth rate decreases when @xmath300 .",
    "these results are in agreement with predictions from w99 .",
    "6 .   the weaker the magnetic field the higher the perturbations peak in all regimes where ambipolar diffusion is present . on the contrary",
    ", both hall limits peak closer to the surface with weaker @xmath156 . 7 .",
    "unstable modes grow when @xmath156 is increased until a critical value @xmath301 is reached . at the critical @xmath156 the growth rate abruptly drops to zero . at good coupling @xmath302 for all conductivity regimes . at the poor coupling limit ( @xmath198 ) ,",
    "results are different only for the hall regime ( @xmath278 ) . in this case",
    "we obtain unstable modes for @xmath303 .",
    "8 .   at very weak magnetic fields ( @xmath304 ) , global effects are less important , due to the high wavenumber of the perturbations .",
    "in this region of parameter space the growth rates of mri perturbations tend to the corresponding local values for the relevant fluid parameters .",
    "hall difussion determines the growth of the mri when @xmath305 .",
    "this condition is satisfied over a large range of radii in protostellar discs .",
    "when the hall regime dominates near the midplane and ambipolar diffusion is dominant closer to the surface , a larger section of the disc is unstable to mri perturbations and unstable modes grow faster than those obtained using the ambipolar diffusion approximation",
    "we thank the referee for useful comments which improved the clarity of the final paper .",
