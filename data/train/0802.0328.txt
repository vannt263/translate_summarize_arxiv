    "the problems of the high t@xmath1 superconductors ( htsc ) have been mostly focused on the electronic correlations and phonons were usually considered as a secondary player at best . however , recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments revived the interest of the possibly important role of phonons in the high - t@xmath1 cuprates ( htc)@xcite . in particular , the systematic measurements and analysis @xcite of the kink structures in the quasiparticle dispersion near the fermi surface ( fs ) proved that : ( 1 ) the origin of the kink is electron - phonon coupling and its coupling is very strong , ( 2 ) the typical energy of the phonon(s ) is @xmath4 40 - 70 mev , and ( 3 ) the coupling matrix is quite anisotropic .",
    "therefore , it is currently a pressing question what possible roles and effects , in particular , for the superconducting ( sc ) pairing , the phonon(s ) can do in the htc .",
    "although the sc gap symmetry in the high - t@xmath1 cuprates is well established as a d - wave by most experiments , there are also continuous experimental reports such as tunnelling conductance @xcite , penetration depth measurements@xcite , etc that provide rather convincing evidences for a small magnitude of a s - wave component in addition to the dominant d - wave sc gap in some of htc compounds . and",
    "it is well known that phonons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons and lead to an isotropic s - wave gap .",
    "therefore , more sharpened question will be : is it possible to reconcile a d - wave gap and a s - wave gap together ?",
    "and in that case , what is the role of phonon(s ) ?",
    "while there is no consensus yet on the pairing mechanism for the d - wave gap in htc , in this paper we assume that the afm spin fluctuations is the mediating glue for d - wave gap @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of this mechanism is that the sign changing character of the d - wave gap turns the all positive definite potential of the afm spin fluctuations mediated interaction ( we will call it `` afm interaction '' for short from now ) , in momentum space and in spin singlet channel , into an effectively attractive pairing interaction . from this point of view , it is clear that the phonon interaction and afm interaction are antagonistic and difficult to work together for making a pairing because they tend to promote a different symmetry of the sc gap each other .",
    "an easy way to reconcile the d - wave and s - wave gap with two different pairing interactions would be to invoke two separate bands for each gap@xcite .",
    "the similar idea for the two s - wave gaps was very successful for mgb@xmath5 @xcite because there two well separated bands exist .",
    "however , in htsc , numerous experiments , in particular arpes measurements@xcite , show that there is only one main band crossing fs .",
    "then any idea of having s - wave and d - wave gaps in the single band , induced by two very different pairing interactions , seems too naive .",
    "however , if the coupling matrix of phonon interaction possesses a strong anisotropy , this combined pairing problem is not a trivial one and needs systematic investigation with a traceable formulation .",
    "this problem has been already studied by many authors with different techniques and aims@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we took a simplest approach and studied the coupled gap equations for multiple gaps of a single band with two pairing interactions , i.e. , afm interaction and anisotropic phonon interaction , within the bcs framework . more justification for this approach",
    "will be discussed in the next section . by numerical solutions",
    ", we extensively investigated the necessary conditions of the strength and the degree of anisotropy of phonon interaction for various multigap solutions .",
    "we found that the ( d+s ) and ( d+@xmath0s ) type solutions are indeed possible with a proper degree of anisotropy of phonon interaction for each case .",
    "however , t@xmath1 is not enhanced at all in these cases even though an additional s - wave component is formed due to the phonon interaction .",
    "other interesting possibility is that the anisotropic phonon interaction can induce an additional d - wave component ( @xmath6 ) to the afm interaction induced d - wave component ( @xmath7 ) . as a result , t@xmath1 is dramatically enhanced due to the phonon interaction .",
    "we then derived an analytic t@xmath1 equation for this ( @xmath8 ) case and showed that phonon isotope effect can be strongly reduced due to the interplay between the afm and phonon interactions despite the large increase of t@xmath1 by phonon .",
    "this result can explain a long standing puzzle of the small phonon isotope effect in htsc .",
    "in view of experiments@xcite , the best anisotropic phonon can be the b@xmath9 buckling phonon mode which fulfills all necessary qualifications for our model .",
    "similar conclusion was obtained by other authors@xcite using different approaches .",
    "we emphasize that the final effect of phonons in htc compounds should be judged by an average effect of all important phonons together , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , we also considered the combined type of ( @xmath10s ) gap which is a very natural solution of the coupled gap equations and shows features such as ( 1 ) large enhanced t@xmath1 , and ( 2 ) appearance of a s - wave component at low temperatures .",
    "this type of gap will be a possible solution for the tunnelling conductance experiment in ybco@xcite .",
    "calculations of superfluidity density also demonstrated that ( @xmath10s ) gap can explain the non - monotonic temperature dependence of the penetration depth measurements in ybco and lsco compounds @xcite .",
    "the interplay between phonons and electronic correlations in htsc has been studied by numerous authors using different theoretical approaches and models @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we took a simple minded approach with a specific question for this problem .",
    "experiments tell us that , after all correlation effects taken place , the quasiparticles ( q.p . ) remain to form a fermi surface ( fs)@xcite . and quite detailed properties of the afm spin fluctuations and symmetry allowed phonons are experimentally measured@xcite ; theses measured bosonic fluctuations are final outcomes after all interplays between them and correlation effects . now on the phenomenological basis , we consider a q.p . band and the afm spin fluctuations as a dominant pairing interaction .",
    "in addition to that we add anisotropic phonon interactions and we study the pairing instability of the model for several possible types of multi - gap solution using a generalized bcs gap equations . in this approach , still remaining interplay between spin fluctuations and phonons is ignored .",
    "the results of this paper should be taken with this caveat .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the dispersion of the quasiparticles created by @xmath13 as standard notation . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the effective interactions , for the singlet superconducting pairing channel , originating from the afm spin fluctuations and phonon(s ) , respectively . for traceable numerical calculations , we further simplify the above hamiltonian as follows .",
    "the real two dimensional fs is simplified as a circular fs and the interactions are also modelled accordingly as follows .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 representing the exchanged momentum @xmath20 and the afm ordering vector @xmath21 in the circular fs , respectively . @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 are chosen to be positive , so that @xmath24 is all repulsive and @xmath25 is all attractive in momentum space .",
    "the property of the afm interaction with a short range correlation is simulated with the inverse correlation length parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . in this paper , we chose @xmath26=1 ( @xmath28 ) for all numerical calculations , which is quite a short range afm correlation .",
    "the degree of anisotropy of the phonon interaction is controlled by the anisotropy angle parameter @xmath29 which restricts the scattering angle between incoming and outgoing q.p momenta ; for example , @xmath30 would allow a perfectly isotropic interaction .",
    "the phonon interaction @xmath31 , however , does not restrict the incoming ( @xmath32 ) and outgoing momenta ( @xmath33 ) . now the reduced bcs hamiltonian in the mean field theory can be written as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the sc gap function induced by @xmath24 and @xmath36 is the one induced by @xmath25 .",
    "the two gap functions @xmath35 and @xmath37 may or may not have the same symmetry .",
    "after diagonalizing the above hamiltonian we obtain two self - consistent equations as    @xmath38    similar coupled gap equations were studied in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the key difference is that our model has only one band .",
    "then because the same band electrons should form the multigaps , there is severe competition between different gaps and more constraint to allow multigap solutions . in the next sections",
    ", we will consider several possible multigap solutions of the above coupled gap equations .      in this case , we assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to the two coupled gap equations as follows .",

    "this abrupt change of gaps is a first order transition and indicates that there are two competing local minima in the free energy . with temperature the global minimum changes from one local minimum to the other local minimum .",

    "for clearness , we rewrite the gap equations describing ( d@xmath2+d@xmath3 + @xmath0 s@xmath3 ) case below .    @xmath183    where the pair susceptibilities @xmath184 are defined in eq.(9 ) and the quasiparticle energy is @xmath185 with @xmath186 . for generality we assume two different phonon interactions @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively but they can be the same phonon as explained above",

    "[ fig9],width=377 ]    in fig.8 we plot the solutions of @xmath192 and @xmath46 components separately .",
    "we fix the afm interaction @xmath193=2.0 and the d - wave boosting phonon interaction @xmath194=0.6 as a case of fig.6 and vary the phonon interaction @xmath189 inducing @xmath0s gap component as 1.0 , 1.1 , and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "t@xmath1 is enhanced by @xmath194 and does nt change for different @xmath189 values because it is determined only by the d - wave gap component .",
    "we also chose the same anisotropy @xmath84 for both phonons @xmath187 and @xmath188 for convenience .",
    "anisotropy condition for the d - wave boosting phonon is important ; optimal anisotropy is @xmath195 for our model .",
    "however , the phonon interaction @xmath188 inducing @xmath0s gap does nt need to be anisotropic .",
    "this type of gap solution can provide a possible resolution to the recent experiments of htc which indicate the presence of a s - wave component at low temperatures .",
    "the anomalous tunnelling conductance in ybco@xcite , non - monotonic behavior of the penetration depth at low temperatures and its isotope effect@xcite , etc indicate a mixed gap of the ( d+@xmath0s ) type at low temperatures and a phonon effect with it .",
    "fig.9 show the normalized specific heat @xmath196 for the gap solutions of fig.8 .",
    "general feature is that it shows a d - wave type specific heat below t@xmath190 and then turns into a s - wave type behavior below t@xmath191 where @xmath0s gap component opens . since the second transition at t@xmath191 is a true second order phase transition , the specific heat exhibits a jump .",
    "but the size of jump is far smaller than the bcs value of @xmath197 .",
    "the reason is because when @xmath0s gap opens at t@xmath191 , the magnitude of d - wave gap also abruptly decreases so that the amount of the specific heat jump is partially cancelled .",
    "nevertheless , careful experiments should be able to discern the jump in the specific heat at the second transition temperature t@xmath191 if this scenario is true .",

    "same parameters as in fig.8 .",
    "[ fig10],width=377 ]    fig.10 shows the normalized superfluid density @xmath200 for the gap solutions of fig.8 .",
    "the general features are the same as in the specific heat : d - wave behavior in between t@xmath190 and t@xmath191 , and s - wave behavior below t@xmath191 . in particular , the additional sharp increase of @xmath201 below t@xmath191 has some resemblance to the experimental observations @xcite although the flattened out behavior at very low temperatures is not clearly observed experimentally .",
    "we propose a firm experimental test for this scenario .",
    "the d - wave boosting phonon interaction does not have a minimum interaction strength ; as far as it has a proper anisotropy it will enhance the d - wave pairing as much as with its strength . for the @xmath0s component to appear below t@xmath191 the phonon interaction needs a minimum strength to overcome a part of d - wave component .",
    "therefore , a controlled suppression of d - wave gap ( with non - magnetic impurities not to weaken the s - wave pairing ) will widen a window of low temperature region where the @xmath0 s component pops up .",
    "in this paper we studied the effects of phonon interaction on the superconducting pairing in the background of d - wave gap already formed by the afm interaction .",
    "in particular , we studied the role of anisotropy of the phonon interaction and possible multigap type solutions within a generalized bcs theory . for many cases",
    "the anisotropy of the phonon interaction is a crucial condition for interesting interplay with the afm interaction but not always ; the ( d+s ) type gap need anisotropic phonon but ( d+@xmath0s ) type gap is more tolerable with the anisotropy of phonon interaction because two gaps are more gently coupled in the ( d+@xmath0s ) case . in both cases ,",
    "t@xmath1 is not enhanced at all by phonon interaction as far as the d - wave gap component remains finite .",
    "anisotropic phonon can boost t@xmath1 together with the afm interaction in the ( @xmath7+@xmath6 ) type solution . with numerical calculations and analytic t@xmath1 equation",
    ", we showed that t@xmath1 is enhanced dramatically following the modified bcs exponential form t@xmath1 @xmath202 with the total coupling strength @xmath203",
    ". this type of solution can also explain how and why the phonon isotope effect is strongly reduced despite the large enhancement of t@xmath1 by phonon .",
    "our isotope coefficient formula eq.(16 ) provides a good description of the overall trend of oxygen isotope coefficient @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "also a combined type solution of ( @xmath10s ) gap is considered .",
    "this type of gap not only shows the features of the @xmath205 gap ",
    "enhanced t@xmath1 and small isotope effect  but also shows the appearance of a s - wave component at low temperatures . the latter feature can provide a microscopic origin of the small s - wave component suggested from recent experiments of tunnelling conductance @xcite and penetration depth measurements @xcite .",
    "calculations of the superfluidity density showed a qualitative agreement with experiments of the abrupt increase of @xmath206 at lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario should be confirmed by experimental observation of a specific heat jump at the second low transition temperature t@xmath191 for the s - wave gap component as shown in fig.9 .",
    "we proposed a systematic impurity doping study to test this scenario .",
    "finally , we would like to restate the limitation of our work .",
    "first , the dynamical interplay between phonon(s ) and afm interaction is not properly treated .",
    "this problem was already studied by many authors@xcite .",
    "we bypassed this complicated problem on the phenomenological basis ; after all correlation effects taken place we assumed that fermion quasiparticles remain , and afm spin fluctuations and several phonon modes are considered as experimentally defined quantities after mutual screening and renormalization .",
    "second , when we consider the s - wave pairing , we should have included the on - site coulomb interaction in the htc cuprates in addition to the phonon interaction .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 in this paper should be considered as a renormalized quantity after including the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "perhaps , this is the reason why our @xmath74 ( @xmath207 ) is order of magnitude smaller than the experimental values@xcite @xmath208 .",
