    "boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics provides a very powerful and suitable tool for handling physical systems where thermodynamic extensivity ( additivity ) holds . apparently , this condition itself points out that bg formalism has some restrictions .",
    "these could be stated as follows : ( i ) the spatial ranges of the microscopic interactions must be short , ( ii ) the time range of the microscopic memory must be short and ( iii ) the system must evolve in an euclidean - like , nonfractal , space - time .",
    "whenever one and/or the others of these restrictions are violated , bg formalism fails to study the system under consideration .",
    "this kind of systems are said to be nonextensive , therefore a nonextensive formalism of statistics is needed for them . in the recent years ,",
    "an increasing tendency towards nonextensive formalisms keeps growing along two lines : quantum - group - like approaches [ 1 ] and tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) [ 2 ] , to which this paper is dedicated .",
    "tt , which has been proposed by c. tsallis in 1988 , is based upon two basic axioms :    \\(a ) the entropy is given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a positive constant , @xmath3 is the probability of the system to be in a microstate , @xmath4 is the total number of configurations and @xmath0 is a real parameter .",
    "\\(b ) the @xmath0-expectation value of an observable @xmath5 is given by    @xmath6    it is worthwhile to note that tt contains bg statistics as a special case in the @xmath7 limit .",
    "extensive shannon entropy and standard definition of the expectation value are recovered in this limit , thus @xmath8 could be interpreted as the measure of the lack of extensivity of the system .",
    "in fact , it is plausible to classify the works on this subject in the following manner : ( i ) some of the works have been devoted to the generalization of the conventional concepts of thermostatistics so far , in order to see whether this nonextensive formalism allows an appropriate extension of these concepts .",
    "( ii ) after these efforts , tt has been applied to some physical systems [ 3 ] where bg formalism is known to fail , and its success on these lines accelerates new attempts nowadays .",
    "( iii ) finally , the last area of interest , which is very active , originates from the fact that the physical meaning of the @xmath0-index has only now started to be clarified .",
    "efforts on this field accumulate along two main streams ; one of which is the study of dynamical systems [ 4 ] in order to find out the connection between the @xmath0-index and the dynamical parameters of the system , whereas the second one is the attempts of establishing some bounds upon @xmath0 by studying , in general , astrophysical problems such as the cosmic microwave background radiation , planck law [ 5,6,7 ] and the early universe [ 8,9 ] . in this study ,",
    "our main goal is to contribute to this stream by estimating some alternative bounds upon @xmath0 .    before closing this section",
    ", it could be mentioned that the reader can find a detailed review of tt with its important properties in [ 10 ] , moreover , a full bibliography of tt is now available in [ 11 ] .",
    "amongst the generalizations of the concepts of thermostatistics in the frame of tt , quantal distribution functions have been studied for the first time by our group [ 12,13 ] . in",
    "[ 12 ] , using the statistical weights , the fractal inspired entropies of quantum gases have been deduced and the generalized distribution functions have been found by introducing the constraints related to the statistical properties of the particles . in [ 13 ] ,",
    "tsallis entropy has been used for the same purpose and the same results for the generalized distribution functions have been reproduced but in this case the constraints have been imposed in the calculations of the partition functions .",
    "very recently , these distribution functions have been reobtained by kaniadakis and quarati [ 14 ] , using a completely different technique .",
    "since the classical statistical distributions could be viewed as stationary states of a linear focker - planck equation , analogously , the authors have shown that [ 15 ] quantal distributions can be obtained , by means of a semiclassical approach , as stationary states of a nonlinear focker - planck equation .",
    "they have found that ; within this kinetic approach , a family of classical and quantal distributions can be derived when the drift and the diffusion coefficients are polynomials of @xmath9 and @xmath10 degrees , respectively , in the velocity variable .",
    "a particular and well - defined distribution corresponds to each pair of @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 gives the generalized distribution functions which are identical with the results of [ 12,13 ] .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that some aspects of generalized quantum statistics can be found in [ 16 ] .",
    "the generalized quantal distribution functions , derived independently in these three papers , are given by    @xmath13^ { 1/(q-1)}+\\kappa}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is @xmath15 and @xmath16 for fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions , respectively , @xmath17 being the chemical potential .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that these expressions for the quantal distribution functions are not exact results due to the approximate scheme used in the calculations .",
    "this scheme is generically based on the factorization of the generalized grand canonical distribution function and the concomitant @xmath0-partition function as if they were extensive quantities , due to the fact that a closed , manageable form for them can not be found without making such approximations .",
    "the authors of the present manuscript have recently discussed the nature of this approximation in [ 7 ] more clearly and showed that these results give upper or lower bounds to the exact results with respect to the values of @xmath0-index .",
    "the role of this approximation is very similar to the role of the mean - field theory approximation used in the theory of phase transitions .",
    "this approximate scheme has also been used in another problem [ 17 ] and it is seen that it gives similar results with the prior works on the same subject .",
    "although the generalized distribution functions are first introduced in 1993 , there has been no attempt to apply them to the physical systems until a recent effort performed by pennini et al .",
    "the authors dealt with @xmath18 independent particles ( fermions and bosons ) , distributed among @xmath19 single particle levels of single particle energies @xmath20 @xmath21 . in order to obtain the exact result",
    ", the authors maximized the tsallis entropy with suitable constraints and found the exact result of an extremely simple model , which is the simplest conceivable situation for fermions where @xmath22 , since otherwise the non - separability of the partition function does not allow to find a close , analytical expression for arbitrary @xmath0 values without making an approximation like the one we discussed above . the average fermion occupation number of the lowest single particle level versus inverse temperature with @xmath23 is given in fig . 1 of [ 18 ] .",
    "pennini et al .",
    "performed the same calculations for bosons as well with @xmath22 .",
    "the average boson occupation number of the lowest single particle level with @xmath23 is given in fig .",
    "3 of [ 18 ] . in both figures",
    ", it is clearly seen that our approximate scheme provides bounds to the exact results ( since pennini et al .",
    "used @xmath24 , the bound appears as a lower bound ) .",
    "this study also suggests that the quality of our approximation deteriorates as the number of particles of the system increases , however , a very recent effort by wang and le mhaut [ 19 ] showed clearly that there exist a temperature interval where the ignorance of the approximation is significant , but outside this interval , the results of this approach can be used with confidence .",
    "in addition , they verified that the magnitude of this interval remains _ constant _ with the increase of the number of particles , a rather nice result in the favour of the approximate scheme , contrary to the result of pennini et al .",
    "the second application of the generalized distribution functions has recently been performed by the authors of this manuscript [ 7 ] .",
    "two years ago , the generalization of the planck law was obtained by tsallis et al .",
    "[ 5 ] for @xmath25 , in order to see whether present cosmic background radiation is ( slightly ) different from the planck radiation law due to the long - range gravitational influence .",
    "we have advanced an alternative approach to this generalization by using one of the generalized distribution functions , namely generalized planck distribution . once again , as expected , our approximate scheme shows itself as an upper or lower bound to the exact result , depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this fact is verified clearly in the figure of [ 7 ] by plotting the blackbody photon energy density per unit volume versus @xmath26 in the frame of [ 7 ] and [ 5 ] .",
    "we have also been able to obtain all the generalized laws , which was found by tsallis et al . , ( i.e. , generalized planck , rayleigh - jeans , stefan - boltzmann and wien laws ) and noticed that our approach is simpler than that of tsallis et al . since the procedure we have used is completely the same as that followed in any standard textbook of statistical physics for the derivation of the standard planck law and also our approximation which leads bounds seems to be more general , since not necessarily @xmath25 .",
    "in [ 7 ] , the generalized planck radiation law is given by    @xmath27^ { \\frac{1}{q-1}}-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 .",
    "for our purpose , it is straightforward to expand this expression to first order in @xmath8 , which reads    @xmath29\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]    for a comparison , eq(5 ) , together with the results of [ 7 ] and [ 5 ] for @xmath30 , have been illustrated in the figure .",
    "the value of the frequency @xmath31 , which makes @xmath30 maximum , can easily be found by maximizing eq.(5 ) :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . substitution of this result in eq.(5 ) immediately yields    @xmath35    with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "lastly , we verify that , for @xmath38 ,    @xmath39    where    @xmath40    with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . from these results ,",
    "the following expression can easily be written :    @xmath43    which is nothing but an alternative estimation of a bound upon @xmath0 , similar to that of given in [ 5 ] by tsallis et al .",
    "( here , @xmath44 stands for the experimental value of @xmath45 ) .",
    "note that although , at first sight , eq.(10 ) seems to be the same with eq.(24 ) of [ 5 ] , in fact they are different since the coefficient @xmath46 is not equal to the one given in [ 5 ] .",
    "strickly speaking , it must be pointed out that all of the coefficients which belong to the nonextensivity part ( namely , @xmath47 , @xmath46 , @xmath48 ) differ from those given in [ 5 ] .    in the remainder of this manuscript ,",
    "we focus our attention to another bound upon @xmath0 , which was established by plastino et al .",
    "[ 6 ] with the help of the expression of @xmath30 given in [ 5 ] and the experimental value of the stefan - boltzmann constant . following the same procedure in [ 6 ] , but using eq.(5 ) for @xmath30",
    ", we establish another bound upon @xmath0 .",
    "let us write down the total emitted power per unit surface , @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the generalized stefan - boltzmann constant , which is given by @xmath51 dx\\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]    if we denote the integral appearing in the above expression by @xmath52 , the explicit numerical solution reads    @xmath53    therefore ,    @xmath54    using this , together with    @xmath55    and the 3 sigma rule [ 6 ]    @xmath56^{1/2}}{\\sigma_q}\\right| \\leq 4.1\\times 10^{-4}\\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ]    it is possible to find a bound upon @xmath0 :    @xmath57    which is similar to that obtained by plastino et al .",
    "in this study , we have concentrated on estimating new bounds upon nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 . for this purpose ,",
    "the generalized planck radiation law has been used and following the same procedure of [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] , two new bounds for @xmath0 has been estimated .",
    "these results are , as expected , consistent with the previous ones , therefore the same conclusions are valid for the present case .    on the other hand , very recently we have realized that the present effort might motivate some other works on the early universe .",
    "more precisely , torres et al . [ 8 ] , within an early universe scenario , calculated the deviation in the primordial helium abundance and obtained a bound for @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , torres and vucetich studied the primordial neutron to baryon ratio in a cosmological expanding background [ 9 ] and within this context , they found another bound upon @xmath0 . in both works ,",
    "the generalized mean value of the particle number operator @xmath58 has been used .",
    "hence , it is clear that these works could be handled again by using the suitable definition of @xmath58 given in eq.(3 ) .    summing up ,",
    "we applied one of the generalized quantal distribution functions to the microwave background radiation in order to estimate new bounds upon @xmath0 and further attempts on this line would highly be welcomed .",
