    "four fundamental forces exist in nature : the electromagnetic force , weak force , strong force and gravitational force .",
    "the search for a unified description of different phenomena has been historically a guiding principle for the progress of physics .",
    "it therefore seems natural to search for a theory unifying all four fundamental interactions . a more solid argument for the unification of fundamental forces",
    "is provided by the fact that the coupling constants of all four interactions seem to converge at the grand unification scale of about @xmath0 .",
    "the standard model provides a quantum version of three of the forces and unifies the electromagnetic and the weak force into electroweak theory .",
    "but there is no real deep unification of the electroweak and qcd ( strong force ) .",
    "the force which is gravity is einsteins classical theory of relativity .",
    "quantization of gravity has been very difficult due to the nonlinear mathematics on which einstein based his theory .",
    "the nonlinear mathematics of general relativity clashes with the requirement of quantum theory .",
    "a necessary condition for renormalizability is absence of negative dimensional coupling constant , but the dimensional coupling of gravity is negative , hence it is nonrenormalisable .",
    "the coupling constant grows stronger with energy and ultraviolet divergences appear when we go to arbitrarily high energies and perturbative theory breaks down .    but is there a need for developing a quantum theory of gravity ? .",
    "the answer is yes and the reasons are :    * quantum cosmology : + at low energies and large distances gravity is weak compared to the other forces but at planck scale energies ( @xmath1 ) and planck scale distances ( @xmath2 ) , which was the state of our universe at the big bang , gravity is strong and comparable to the strength of the other forces .",
    "thus quantum mechanics comes into play and a quantum description is necessary . * singularity theorems : + in general relativity , singularities are unavoidable as proved by hawking and penrose .",
    "thus general relativity predicts its own breakdown .",
    "experimental evidence from cosmic microwave background radiation indicates that the universe started from an initial singularity .",
    "this singularity can not be explained by einstein s classical theory of general relativity hence there is a need for a quantum version .",
    "* black hole information paradox : + hawking s discovery of black hole radiation indicates a contradiction of quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "general relativity suggest that not even light can get out of a black hole horizon whilst quantum mechanics says we need the information inside the black hole .",
    "thus there is information loss and violation of unitarity .",
    "an indication of a possible non - locality in physics .",
    "a full quantum theory must explain this puzzle .",
    "* unification of all interactions : + at present all non - gravitational interactions have been accommodated into a quantum framework as presented by the standard model .",
    "since gravity couples to all forms of energy as stated by the equivalence principle , it is expected that in a unified theory of all interactions , gravity must be quantized .",
    "* ultra violet divergences : + quantum field theory is plaque with divergences .",
    "it is believed that at small distances ( high momenta ) space - time is quantized and this divergences can be avoided    a correct quantum theory of gravity must , as listed in@xmath3 :    * tell us whether the principles of general relativity and quantum mechanics are true as they stand , or are in need of modification . *",
    "give a precise description of nature at all scales , including the planck scale .",
    "* tell us what time and space are , in a language fully compatible with both quantum theory and the fact that the geometry of space - time is dynamical .",
    "tell us how light cones , causal structure , the metric , etc are to be described quantum mechanically , and at the planck scale .",
    "* give a derivation of the black hole entropy and temperature .",
    "explain how the black hole entropy can be understood as a statistical entropy , gotten by coarse graining the quantum description .",
    "* be compatible with the apparently observed positive , but small , value of the cosmological constant .",
    "explain the entropy of the cosmological horizon .",
    "* explain what happens at singularities of classical general relativity .",
    "* be fully background independent .",
    "this means that no classical fields , or solutions to the classical field equations appear in the theory in any capacity , except as approximations to quantum states and histories . *",
    "predict new physical phenomenon , at least some of which are testable in current or near future experiments .",
    "* explain how classical general relativity emerges in an appropriate low energy limit from the physics of the planck scale .",
    "* predict whether the observed global lorentz invariance of flat space - time is realized exactly in nature , up to infinite boost parameter , or whether there are modifications of the realization of lorentz invariance for planck scale energy and momenta . *",
    "provide precise predictions for the scattering of gravitons , with each other and with other quanta , to all orders of perturbative expansion around the semi - classical approximation .",
    "some of the main approaches toward the goal of developing a quantum theory of gravity are@xmath4    * quantum general relativity : + here quantization rules are applied to classical relativity .",
    "some examples are * * covariant quantization : examples include 1 ) perturbation quantum gravity , where the metric @xmath5 is decomposed into background part @xmath6 and a small perturbative part , @xmath7 , 2 ) effective field theories and renormalization - group approaches , 3 ) path integral methods , 4 ) dynamic triangulation . *",
    "* canonical quantization : examples include quantum geometrodynamics and loop quantum gravity . *",
    "string theory : here fundamental particles are described as one - dimensional objects ( see later sections in this review ) .",
    "* quantization of topology or the theory of casual sets .",
    "the two leading theories in the search for a quantum gravitational theory are loop quantum gravity and superstring theory",
    ".    superstring theory appears to have an edge over loop quantum gravity as the current best quantum gravity theory . in string theory gravity",
    "arises naturally as a field with quanta called the graviton .",
    "in addition to providing a quantum theory of gravity it also unifies all four interactions as opposed to loop quantum gravity which only provides a quantum gravity theory in four space - time dimensions . string theory has made significant progress on some of the listed requirements above , such as statistical prediction of black hole entropy , and has many attractive features such as prediction of supersymmetry , gravity , and extra dimensions .",
    "also it has no adjustable dimensionless parameters@xmath8 .",
    "it also unifies of all known interactions with absence of ultraviolet divergences which makes it more predictive than conventional quantum field theory .    for superstring / m theory to gain full acceptance as a theory giving a unified description of nature and the fundamental forces , it must make testable predictions .",
    "unfortunately the string scale is @xmath9 the planck scale and not accessible to current accelerators .",
    "however if supersymmetry breaking occurs at @xmath10 as suggested , then supersymmetry could be discovered at the lhc at cern .",
    "discovering supersymmetry would give string theory a big boost showing that gravity , gauge theory , and supersymmetry that arise from string theory in roughly the same way are all part of the description of nature .",
    "recent development in cosmology indicate that it will be possible to use astrophysics to perform tests of fundamental theory inaccessible to particle accelerators , namely the physics of the vacuum and cosmic evolution .",
    "the current best theory we have for explaining the evolution of our universe is inflationary / big bang theory .",
    "this has however not provided a satisfactory explanation of the smallness of the cosmological constant , one of the greatest challenges in physics today .",
    "superstring / m theory has made some headway describing this cosmic evolution and proposing a solution to the cosmological constant problem by providing the ekrypotic / cyclic model .",
    "this postulates that our universe resulted from collision of branes embedded in higher dimensions .",
    "there are several evolutionary cycles with a collision occurring in each cycle .",
    "the cycle begins with a big bang and ends with a big crunch .",
    "it explains that the smallness of the cosmological constant as resulting from the dynamic relaxation of the potential of a quintessence scalar field whose field value also determines the interbrane separation .",
    "the potential of this scalar field includes all quantum fluctuations and this total value of potential reduces for every cycle of evolution .",
    "however it has received some criticism from some authors that it is not an alternative to inflationary theory but just another inflationary theory@xmath11 .",
    "increasing evidences from cosmology experiments have shown that our universe is evolving towards a pure de sitter space - time .",
    "this poses a serious problem for superstring / m theory since an s - matrix can not be well defined for a de sitter space - time .    in this review",
    "i will give a brief overview of the concepts behind string theory ( see @xmath12 for detailed review ) and then discuss issues related to the cosmological constant .",
    "i will then conclude with a suggestion on areas that may lead to a solution of these major problems we are encountering in physics .",
    "string theory and cosmology are increasingly becoming broad areas of research and it is impossible to discuss everything into details in one review . some topics may not be discussed into details since the main goal of this work is to bring important ideas and developments into one review manual to be easily accessible to the reader thus acting as a good reference source .",
    "it is expected that the reader will consult the references for more detailed discussion .",
    "superstring theory is based on the idea that fundamental objects are not point particles as in particle theories but one dimensional objects called strings .",
    "the different vibration modes of the fundamental string which could be either open ( have neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions ) or closed ( no boundary conditions ) , are what we call particles , and which from far look like point particles . anomaly cancellations leaves us with only five consistent superstring theories , each living in ten space - time dimensions .",
    "these five theories are called type i , type iia , type iib , so(32 ) heterotic , and @xmath13 heterotic .",
    "type one contains only open strings whilst the others contain both open and closed strings ( see table @xmath14 ) .",

    "after gso projection all space - time bosonic states arise from the ns sector e.g the eight massless photon states arising from a maxwell gauge field , and all the space - time fermionic states arise from the r sector .",
    "the ground states in closed superstrings theories are constructed by tensor products of eight left - moving coordinates of the ( ns or r ) sector with a eight right - moving coordinates of ( ns or r ) sector .",
    "leading to four sectors ns - ns and r - r which are bosonic states and ns - r , r - ns which are fermionic states .",
    "ns - ns massless fields comprises of the graviton @xmath5 , the kalb - ramond field @xmath16 and the dilaton @xmath17 .",
    "together we have 128 massless bosonic states and 128 massless fermionic states as required by supersymmetry .",
    "all massive states are a result of excitation of these ground states .",
    "the ns - ns bosons of type iia and type iib theories are the same but the r - r bosons are different . in type iia theory",
    "the massless r - r bosons include the maxwell field @xmath18 and a three - index antisymmetric gauge field @xmath19 . in type iib theory",
    "the massless r - r bosons include a scalar field a , a kalb - ramond field @xmath20 , and a totally antisymmetric field @xmath21 .",
    "heterotic superstrings are constructed from tensor products of 10 left - moving coordinates of open bosonic string living in 26 space - time dimension , with 10 right moving coordinates of open superstring living in ten dimensions .",
    "these results in a theory living ten dimensional space - time . enforcing absence of gravitational and gauge anomalies produces the gauge groups so(32 ) and @xmath13 .    by defining strings as one",
    "dimensional objects worldlines of particle become world sheets such that space - time is smeared out and there are no singular interaction points thus ultraviolet divergences found in field theories are avoided . to avoid tachyons ( negative mass states ) in the spectrum ,",
    "string theory requires supersymmetry , a space - time symmetry relating fermions and bosons . and",
    "for consistency a ten dimensional space - time .    in string theory",
    "one replaces feynman diagrams with stringy ones and space - time is not really needed .",
    "one just needs two - dimensional field theory describing the propagation of strings .",
    "whereas in ordinary physics one talks about space - time and classical fields it may contain , in string theory one talks about an auxiliary two - dimensional field theory that encodes the information . a space - time that obeys its classical equations corresponds to a two - dimensional field theory that is conformally invariant@xmath22 .    in the effective description of string theory , i.e at scales below the planck scale the massive string states are integrated out since they do not propagate .",
    "thus we are left with only massless modes . the bosonic part of the effective action is the given by@xmath23 :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 does not depend on which of the superstring theories we are are looking at , and @xmath26 is model dependent which for type ii strings is given by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the field strength of a p+1 form rr gauge field and p is the spatial dimension of an extended object called p - brane that couples electrically to the p+2 form gauge field .",
    "the bosonic fields in the universal sector comprises of the metric , the dilaton and the b field , all massless modes .",
    "the action is given by :    @xmath29    @xmath30 is the ten dimensional gravitational constant , where @xmath31 is the slope parameter defining the string tension .",
    "g is the determinant of the metric @xmath5 , r is the scalar curvature , h is the field strength of the b field @xmath32 , and @xmath17 is the scalar field called the dilaton .",
    "our world is four dimensional with broken supersymmetry thus the only way for superstring theory to provide a realistic theory making contact with our world is by compactification of the extra six dimensions and breaking down of supersymmetry .",
    "there are several methods of compatification : toroidal , orbifolds and orientifolds .",
    "the simplest case is toroidal ( compact space is a torus ) compactification which is the same as kaluza - klein compactification in field theory which attempts to unify gauge interactions and gravity .",
    "curling up a spatial dimension into a circle leads to the spectrum of closed strings having two components : their momentum along the circle is quantized in the form @xmath33 , where n is an integer , and winding states @xmath34 due to wrapping of the string around the circle m times , where r is radius of compactification , and w is called the winding number .    the presence of extra - dimensions would not be detected directly if the size of the compact space is of order @xmath35 .",
    "after compactification of the six dimensions , our space - time becomes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is our four dimensional minkowski space - time and m is the compact space .",
    "each point in the non - compact space then becomes associated with a tiny ball of six - dimensional space .",
    "compactification on @xmath38 preserves too much supersymmetry , but we speculate some minimal supersymmmetry to exist in our 4 dimensional world at energy scales above 1 tev .",
    "most choices of @xmath39 will not yield a consistent string theory since the associated two - dimensional field theory which is now most appropriately described as a non - linear sigma model with target space @xmath36- will not be conformally invariant .    to preserve the minimal amount of supersymmetry n=1 in 4 dimensions",
    ", we need to compactify on a special kind of 6-manifold called a calabi - yau manifold .",
    "a calabi - yau manifold is a complex manifold which admits a metric @xmath5 whose ricci tensor @xmath40 vanishes .",
    "the problem is that there are many calabi - yau manifolds each with different physics on @xmath37 and not knowing which is the right one to choose leads to lost of predictive power .",
    "compactification leads to larger degrees of freedom and to several new stringy phenomena such as : winding states , enhanced gauge symmetries , dualities and d - branes .",
    "when the five consistent string theories are compactified on an appropriate manifold from their ten dimensional space - time , several different string theories emerge in lower dimensions .",

    "the argument towards this approach was laid as follows- :    a black hole has an event horizon and its entropy is bounded by the area of the event horizon given by bernstein - hawking s formula :    @xmath361    where a is the surface area , @xmath362 is newton s gravitational constant    and a temperature given by : @xmath363    where m is the mass of the black hole .",

    "thus an asymptotically de sitter universe can be described by a finite number of states , given by the bernstein - hawking formula stated above .",
    "now relating the cosmological constant to n , implies a bound on the cosmological constant .",

    "<S> the two major goals in fundamental physics are : 1 ) unification of all forces incorporating relativity and quantum theory , 2 ) understanding the origin and evolution of the universe as well as explaining the smallness of the cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> several efforts have been made in the last few decades towards achieving these goals with some successes and failures . </S>",
    "<S> the current best theory we have for unification of all forces is superstring / m theory . however current evidence suggests our universe is flat and accelerating . a universe with a positive cosmological constant will have serious implications for string theory since the s - matrix can not be well defined and superstring / m theory is only formulated in flat minkowski background . </S>",
    "<S> holographic principle provides a way out as shown by the ads / cft and ds / cft correspondence , but it remains to be proved if it is valid for our non - conformal , non - supersymmetric universe . aside from the issue of defining m - theory in a de sitter background , why the cosmological constant is </S>",
    "<S> so small remains puzzling and needs to be understood . </S>",
    "<S> the `` cosmological constant problem '' has brought physics to a standstill towards any major development and remains currently the most disturbing issue .    </S>",
    "<S> conventional big bang cosmology has not yet produced a satisfactory explanation of the small value of the cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> an attempt by superstring / m theory in this direction is given by the ekpyrotic / cyclic model .    the aim of this review is not to introduce any new concepts not already known , but give an overview of current state of affairs in high energy physics , highlighting some successes and failures and making some few suggestions on areas to focus to resolve some of these outstanding issues .    </S>",
