    "the locations and wind parameters of the stellar wind sources are summarized in table  [ quint.srcs ] , and their relative positions are shown in figure  [ fig - quint ] .",
    "our calculations use the three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code discussed in @xcite and @xcite , modified as described in @xcite to include stellar wind sources .",
    "the gridless lagrangean nature of sph allows us to concentrate spatial resolution near shocks and model gas dynamics and wind - wind interactions on length scales that vary by several orders of magnitude within a single calculation .",
    "we assume that the gas behaves as an ideal gas , according to a gamma - law ( @xmath52 ) equation of state .",
    "the effect of self - gravity on the dynamics of the gas should be negligible compared to the effect of the central cluster potential ; we calculate gravitational effects by approximating the potential of each cluster with a plummer model .",
    "the computational domain for the simulation of each cluster is a cube approximately @xmath53  pc on a side , centered on the middle of the cluster . to simulate `` flow - out '' conditions , particles passing through the outer boundary",
    "are removed from the simulation .",
    "the initial conditions assume that the space around and within each cluster is empty ; massive stars in each cluster then inject matter into the volume of solution via winds as the calculation progresses .",
    "the number of particles in each simulation initially grows rapidly , but reaches a steady number ( @xmath54 million particles for simulations of the arches cluster and @xmath55 million particles for the quintuplet simulations , since there are fewer identified wind sources in the latter ) when the addition of particles from wind sources is compensated by the loss of particles through the outer boundary of the computational domain .",
    "we model the gravitational potential @xmath56 of a cluster using a plummer model @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total mass of the cluster .",
    "the radial density profile assumed for the cluster is therefore @xmath59 where the central density @xmath60 is @xmath61 we note that the spatial distributions of massive stars in the clusters are not entirely consistent with the distribution implied by the plummer potential ; for example , the average projected distance of both the set of massive stars and the set of all observed stars in the arches cluster is roughly twice the average distance predicted by a plummer model based on the estimated total mass and central density of the cluster .",
    "we include the plummer potential to approximate the combined gravitational influence of the entire cluster , including the estimated mass of stars too small or dim to be observed .",
    "@xcite provide estimates of the total mass of each cluster by measuring the mass of observed stars , assuming a salpeter imf slope , and extrapolating down to @xmath62observed stars account for at most 25% of the mass of the arches cluster and 16% of the mass of the quintuplet cluster .",
    "they also estimate the density of each cluster by determining the volume of the cluster from the average projected distance of stars from the cluster center , and dividing the total mass by this volume ; because the values are calculated using the total cluster mass but only the average projected cluster radius , the density estimates are probably closer to the central densities than the average densities .",
    "we assume that the values reported are the central densities of the clusters .",
    "the total cluster mass and central density and the calculated value of @xmath63 for each cluster are presented in table  [ table - props ] .",
    "we implement wind sources as literal sources of sph particles , using the scheme described in @xcite .",
    "the mass loss rates and wind velocities inferred from observations are reported in tables  [ arches.srcs ] and [ quint.srcs ] .",
    "we position each source at its observed @xmath64 and @xmath65 location and choose the @xmath66 coordinate randomly , subject to the constraint that the wind sources are uniformly distributed over a range in @xmath66 equal to the observed range in @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the choice of @xmath66 positions has a much smaller effect on the x - ray luminosity than the choice of mass - loss rate ( discussed below ) ; @xcite performed simulations of wind sources in the central few parsecs of the galaxy with two different sets of @xmath66 positions , and the average @xmath67  kev x - ray luminosity from the central 10@xmath68 of the simulations differed by only 16% ( @xmath69  erg  s@xmath2  arcsec@xmath70 from a simulation with a dense arrangement of wind sources in the center of the volume of solution versus @xmath71  erg  s@xmath2  arcsec@xmath70 from a simulation with wind sources uniformly distributed in @xmath66 ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite conducted three simulations of the arches cluster in which @xmath66 positions of sources were chosen by sampling from a distribution function @xmath72 ; they found a difference in @xmath73  kev x - ray luminosity of only 3% between the most and least luminous simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig - arches ] shows the positions in the sky plane of the wind sources in the arches cluster , while figure  [ fig - quint ] shows the wind sources in the quintuplet cluster ; the size of the circle marking each source corresponds to the relative mass loss rate ( on a linear scale ) for that star .",
    "the initial temperature of the winds is not well known ; for simplicity , we assume that all of the winds have a temperature of @xmath74  k. our results are fairly insensitive to this value , however , since the temperature of the shocked gas is determined primarily by the kinetic energy flux carried into the collision by the winds . the sources are assumed to be stationary over the duration of the simulation .",
    "we conduct two simulations of the wind - wind interactions in each cluster ; the simulations differ only in the choice of mass - loss rate for each star , with the wind speed assumed constant",
    ". the `` standard '' simulations use mass - loss rates inferred from observations as described in  ",

    "an on - axis _ chandra _ observation of the arches cluster was taken on 2004 june 8 for 98.6  ksec .",
    "the acis - i detector was placed at the focal plane .",
    "the data were analyzed with the latest ciao ( version 3.1 ) .",
    "while results of this observation will be presented in an upcoming paper @xcite , we concentrate here on the comparison of the data with the simulations .",
    "figure  [ chandra - arches ] shows an overlay of an x - ray intensity contour map on a _ hst _ nicmos image of the arches cluster @xcite . the actual spatial resolution ( with a fwhm @xmath75 ) is better than what appears on this smoothed image .",
    "the position coincidence of the point - like x - ray sources and bright near - ir objects is apparent . to compare with the simulated cluster wind properties , we remove a region of twice the 90% energy - encircled radius around each of the sources",
    "all four simulations were run significantly past the point in time when the stellar winds fill the volume of solution and gas shocked in wind - wind collisions fills the core of each cluster .",
    "the arches cluster simulations were run past @xmath76  yr ; the quintuplet simulations were run for over @xmath77  yr .",
    "the winds in each simulation reach the edge of the volume of solution after @xmath78  yr , but the most relevant timescale for determining when the simulations reach a steady level of x - ray luminosity is the time required to fill the core of each cluster with shocked gas . the arches cluster core is roughly five times smaller in radius than the core of the quintuplet cluster , so the x - ray luminosity from the arches simulations reaches a steady value relatively quickly compared to the quintuplet simulations .      in order to calculate the observed continuum spectrum , we assume that the observer is positioned along the positive @xmath66-axis at infinity and we sum the emission from all of the gas injected by the stellar wind sources into the volume of each calculation . for the conditions encountered in the two clusters , scattering is negligible and the optical depth is always less than unity . for these temperatures and densities , the dominant components of the continuum emissivity are electron - ion ( @xmath79 ) and electron - electron ( @xmath80 ) bremsstrahlung .",
    "we assume that the gas is in ionization equilibrium , although spectra obtained from the arches cluster with _",
    "chandra _ indicate the presence of line emission at @xmath81  kev ; however , no other significant lines are observed , so our use of a bremsstrahlung model without line emission is a reasonable approximation .",
    "future , more refined versions of the calculations reported here will need to include the effects of partial ionization in the shocked gas , a condition suggested by the iron line emission .",
    "we note , however , that the overall energetics and diffuse x - ray luminosity calculated by assuming full ionization err only marginally since the fraction of charges free to radiate via bremsstrahlung should be very close to one .",
    "the x - ray luminosities calculated from our simulations support the recent result of @xcite that the majority of the x - ray emission from these clusters ( e.g. , @xmath82 for arches ) is probably due to point sources .",
    "the diffuse 0.210  kev x - ray luminosity calculated from our `` standard '' arches cluster simulation@xmath83  erg  s@xmath2falls below the 0.210  kev luminosity of @xmath84  erg  s@xmath2 from the a1 and a2 components reported in @xcite ; the simulation using elevated estimates for the mass - loss rates produces @xmath85  erg  s@xmath2 between 0.2 and 10  kev , or 53% of the emission observed by _",
    "chandra_. on the other hand , @xcite now identify a1 and a2 as point - like components ; after subtracting the contributions of a1 and a2 , @xcite find that the a3 component has a 0.510  kev luminosity of @xmath86  erg  s@xmath2 .",
    "our `` standard '' simulation produces @xmath87  erg  s@xmath2 between 0.5 and 10  kev ; lowering the mass - loss estimates of all wind sources by @xmath88 or slightly decreasing the assumed wind velocities would produce even better agreement .",
    "our `` standard '' and `` high- '' simulations of the quintuplet cluster produce @xmath89  erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath90  erg  s@xmath2 , respectively , between 0.5 and 8  kev .",
    "@xcite estimate a 0.58  kev luminosity of @xmath91  erg  s@xmath2 for the diffuse emission from the quintuplet cluster , but they point out that other regions of diffuse emission to the north and south of the cluster introduce a complicated pattern of background emission and limit the precision of this estimate .    the long - term variation of the x - ray luminosity as a function of time demonstrates some of the key differences between the two clusters .",
    "figures  [ lvst - arches ] and [ lvst - quint ] show the time variation of the 0.58  kev x - ray luminosity from all four simulated clusters .",
    "each large graph shows the variation over the course of the entire simulation ( @xmath92  yr for the simulations of the arches cluster , and @xmath93  yr for the quintuplet simulations ) , while each inset graph shows variation over @xmath34 timesteps , or @xmath94  yr . the fact that the quintuplet cluster is nearly five times larger in radius than the arches cluster means that much more time is required for shocked gas to fill the central region .",
    "the arches cluster reaches a steady x - ray luminosity after less than @xmath95  yr , while the luminosity of the quintuplet cluster does not clearly level off until more than @xmath96  yr have passed .",
    "the two clusters also exhibit differences in the size of short - term fluctuations in x - ray luminosity .",
    "both simulations of the arches cluster show short - term variations in luminosity of @xmath97 over timescales of @xmath98  yr , while the x - ray luminosity in the `` standard '' quintuplet simulation fluctuates by @xmath99 , and short - term variations in the `` high- '' simulation of the quintuplet cluster are as large as @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ chandra - arches ] shows that many of the bright x - ray peaks in the arches cluster correspond to actual stars , presumably binaries whose binary wind interactions produce the strong localized x - ray emission .",
    "these sources must be subtracted to study the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the simulated 0.58  kev x - ray contours from the region near the core of the arches cluster , shown in figure  [ contour - arches ] , are generally comparable to the contours generated from _ chandra _",
    "observations ( figure  [ chandra - arches ] ; see also figure 2b , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the strongest emission in the simulations and in _ chandra _ images comes from the core of the cluster , and both sets of contours form elliptical patterns aligned primarily north - south .",
    "x - ray contours from the simulation of the quintuplet cluster are shown in figure  [ contour - quint ] ; the quintuplet cluster is significantly less dense than the arches cluster , so the x - ray emission is correspondingly less strongly peaked toward the center of the cluster .",
    "the plots in figure  [ lvsr ] show the total 0.58  kev luminosity from concentric columns aligned along the line of sight and extending outward in radius from the center of the arches ( left ) and quintuplet ( right ) clusters . the most luminous gas in the arches cluster is confined to within @xmath101 of the center of the cluster ;",
    "in contrast , we include stars beyond @xmath102 in the quintuplet cluster , and its luminosity continues to increase even beyond a radius of @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , the plots in figure  [ fvsr ] show the 28  kev x - ray flux per square arcmin as a function of distance from the center of each cluster from all four simulations .",
    "the individual crosses and error bars in the graph from the arches cluster represent flux measurements from _ chandra _ observations of the cluster , after point sources have been removed and an estimate of the background x - ray flux has been subtracted . here",
    "we assume that all of the emission centered around nicmos stellar sources is due to binary wind interactions .",
    "the estimated background0.064  counts  s@xmath2  arcmin@xmath70is the average number of counts obtained in an annulus between radii of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the simulations of the arches cluster apparently produce more x - rays near the center of the cluster but decrease in intensity more rapidly toward larger radii",
    ". the relatively flat surface brightness profile evident in the _ chandra _ data outside a radius of @xmath105 may arise in part from the presence of additional background x - ray emission near the galactic center .",
    "it may also indicate confinement of the x - ray - emitting gas in the arches cluster by ram pressure exerted by a molecular cloud or other external medium surrounding the cluster ; our calculations include no such medium , so the simulated gas escapes and cools more rapidly as it leaves the core of the cluster .",
    "one way to constrain the amount of confining material surrounding the cluster is to measure expansion velocities of the gas out of the cluster . in our simulations , which did not include confining gas",
    ", the material accelerates until it reaches an asymptotic velocity limit roughly equal to the mean wind velocity ( figure  [ vvsr ] ) . in the arches cluster , we reach that limit . in the ( larger ) quintuplet cluster ,",
    "that limit apparently occurs at a distance from the cluster center that is larger than the size of the simulation . however ,",
    "if molecular clouds or additional stars with strong winds are producing a confining ram pressure around this cluster , the outflowing gas will decelerate .",
    "measurements of this velocity will constrain the parameters of the surrounding material ; future simulations can use these constraints to include the effects of this material .",
    "although the diffuse x - ray flux in clusters may be used to probe stellar mass - loss , two notable complications in the case of the arches and quintuplet clusters are the x - ray background present in the galactic center , and the contributions made to the overall emission by point ( i.e. , binary wind ) sources .",
    "the contribution made by the x - ray background is difficult to quantify ; @xcite report that background contributions lead to significant uncertainty in the measured x - ray flux from the quintuplet cluster .",
    "the contribution from point sources is easier to handle ; with its relatively high spatial resolution , _ chandra _ can produce reasonable images in which the required point - source subtraction may be made .",
    "point sources in the arches cluster all exhibit a 6.7  kev line ; the absence of such a line in the spectrum of the diffuse emission indicates that the point - source contribution to the diffuse emission is not likely to be significant .",
    "if , based on the observations made by @xcite , we assume that a1 and a2 are not point - like and do not subtract the contributions of point sources from the overall x - ray flux , it appears that the diffuse x - ray flux is consistent with higher mass - loss rates than the ( @xmath106  yr@xmath2 ) @xmath107  yr@xmath2 assumed for stars ( less than ) above 60m@xmath108 . as we have seen , however , the observed point - source - subtracted diffuse emission matches our calculated x - ray flux to within a factor 2 when we adopt the currently accepted stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "indeed , lowering the mass - loss rate estimates of all wind sources by about @xmath109 would produce significant agreement between theory and observation .",
    "but we must make sure that we have a complete accounting of all the wind sources and carry through with a more careful point - source subtraction before we can completely confirm such claims .",
    "the fact that the simulated x - ray flux density from the arches cluster drops off more rapidly than the observed profile ( see figure  [ fvsr ] ) means that ( 1 ) we may have underestimated the contribution of the x - ray background ; or , ( 2 ) we have ignored the possibly important dynamical influence of a confining molecular gas outside the cluster . interpreting data beyond these radii ( roughly @xmath105 for arches and @xmath110 for quintuplet ) requires more detailed information on the cluster environment there .",
    "x - rays do prove to be an ideal probe of bulk mass - loss rates in clusters .",
    "the x - ray emission depends sensitively on the mass - loss rates of the constituent stars and , based on our simulations of the arches cluster , we can already limit the mass - loss rates to within a factor of 2 of the currently accepted values .",
    "this also implies that the assumed abundances in the galactic center environment are essentially correct , since the mass - loss rates from stellar models depend on the adopted metallicity .",
    "in addition , studying the x - ray emission from the outer region of the cluster may eventually lead to a better understanding of the medium within which the cluster is embedded .",
    "this is clearly relevant to the question of how these unusual clusters came to be , and the relative roles played by `` standard star formation '' versus stellar capture from outside the cluster .",
    "the inferred stellar constituents of these clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) also seem to be consistent with the required mass loss rates , so the inferred unusual mass function of the arches , quintuplet , and central clusters continues to pose a challenge to our understanding of how these stellar aggregates were first assembled .",
