    "a large relative velocity ( central panel ) induces a significant offset between the dark and baryonic component of the main cluster ( see table [ runsresults ] for details ) but it also leads to substantial disruption of the main cluster gaseous core .",

    "decreasing the relative velocity between the two clusters ( bottom panel ) two x - ray peaks are clearly visible but the displacement of the main cluster gas is now negligible due to the lower ram - pressure experienced by the main cluster core .",

    "a bow shock is clearly visible on the right of each image .",
    "the shape of the shock front is only marginally dependent on the kinematics of the model while the distance between the edge of the bullet ( the so called contact discontinuity ) and the shock front becomes larger for decreasing bullet velocities .",
    "the contact discontinuity itself is much flatter in the case of 1:6b0 than in the low velocity encounter 1:6v3000b0 and clearly not comparable with observations , which show a more narrow structure . in general , a more efficient ram - pressure during the phase of core - core interaction is associated with a larger opening angle of the contact discontinuity at the present time @xcite .    the rest of the runs listed in table [ runs ] have an impact parameter @xmath26 equal to 150 kpc , comparable with the core radius @xmath42 of the main cluster gas distribution for most of the models . for a plasma distributed",
    "according to a @xmath2 profile like the one adopted in this paper the assumption @xmath43 kpc implies that the maximum external density crossed by the core of the sub - cluster is 1.5 times smaller than the one it would pass through for @xmath27 kpc . for the same initial velocity , the sub - cluster also sees a weaker potential with respect to the case of a head - on encounter and experiences a smaller maximum orbital velocity .",
    "a choice of a much larger value of @xmath26 would further decrease the mutual ram - pressure between the two systems and require much higher relative velocities in order to explain the observed offset between the gas and dark matter .    in fig .",

    "decreasing the mass ratio between the two interacting systems ( runs 1:6 and 1:8 ) the displacement in the bullet becomes larger than that in the main cluster .",
    "the run 1:6 is characterized by an initial sub - cluster velocity of 5000 km s@xmath8 ( as well as runs 1:3 and 1:8 ) in the system of reference where the main cluster is at rest , that corresponds to a present time velocity of @xmath45 km s@xmath8 in the center of mass rest frame .",
    "the same model is simulated assuming lower relative velocities ( 1:6v3000 and 1:6v2000 ) . with decreasing velocities",
    "the offset in the sub - cluster becomes smaller and the x - ray emission from the bullet less pronounced with respect to the bright x - ray emitting region at the center of the main cluster . at the same time",
    "the shape of the contact discontinuity changes , getting progressively more narrow while the distance between the contact discontinuity and the shock front increases as will be shown more quantitatively in the next section .",
    "the displacement associated with the main - cluster is determined by the distance of closest approach between the centers of the two clusters , which becomes smaller  assuming the same initial impact parameter @xmath26  with decreasing bullet velocities .",
    "indeed , the separation between the main cluster x - ray emission peak and its dark matter counterpart is maximum in the case of the low velocity run 1:6v2000 .",
    "[ future ]    a not negligible fraction of the x - ray emission visible at the present time near the center of the main - cluster is actually associated with hot gas stripped from the external regions of the bullet . fig .",

    "it shows the individual distribution of gas originating from the main ( top ) and sub - cluster ( bottom ) and lying at the present time within 1 mpc from the center of the system . comparing these images with the middle right panel of fig .",
    "[ b>0 ] it appears evident that the bright elongated x - ray feature crossing the second innermost isodensity contour is associated with the displaced gaseous center of the main cluster while the surrounding more diffuse region hosts a significant amount of sub - cluster gas . indeed , as it shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ mixing ] , the motion of the bullet across the inner regions of the main system creates a low density `` tunnel '' in the main cluster gas distribution . at the same time the sub - cluster looses a large amount of baryonic material during the phase of core - core interaction .",
    "this material , which fills the tunnel , falls back into the gravitational center of the main cluster and resides now at more than 500 kpc distance from the x - ray bullet . as we will show in the next section , the amount of gas deposited by the sub - cluster in the central regions of the main system increases with decreasing relative velocities .",
    "this trend explains the relative increase in luminosity of the diffuse strongly emitting component if compared to the peak associated to the main cluster core gas ( always in the upper right region with respect to the center of the mass density distribution ) , when we compare run 1:6 with the low velocity run 1:6v2000 where it becomes the primary peak of x - ray emission .    as shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ b>0 ] a main halo with low concentration ( @xmath17 ) does not survive a 1:6 sub - cluster encounter with velocity @xmath46 km s@xmath8 and its x - ray peak is destroyed .",
    "as previously noticed by @xcite the choice of a lower gas fraction ( @xmath47 in three of the last four runs of table [ runs ] ) does not affect significantly the x - ray map morphology although the displacement of the two luminosity peaks with respect to their dark matter counterparts slightly changes .    finally , we tested the consequences caused by including radiative cooling and choosing a larger main halo model ( fig .",
    "[ b>02 ] ) .",
    "cooling makes the contact discontinuity more narrow and the amount of diffuse x - ray gas around the peak associated with the main cluster smaller .",
    "the offset in the main and sub - cluster remains unaltered .",
    "run 1:6v3000big is characterized by a main cluster total mass of @xmath48 , which is closer to the value adopted by @xcite and predicted by fitting the large field weak lensing data with extremely low concentrated ( @xmath49 ) nfw halos .",
    "although the initial relative velocity is only 3000 km s@xmath8 , due to the large mass of the host halo the present time velocity of the bullet in the center of mass rest frame is much higher than in the corresponding 1:6v3000 run .",
    "consequently the offset of the x - ray peak associated with the main cluster is less than 100 kpc and the amount of gas lost by the bullet in the core of the main system closer to that observed in 1:6 than in 1:6v3000 .    summarizing , run 1:6v3000 , with mass ratio 1:6 , initial relative velocity @xmath50 km s@xmath8 and present time sub - cluster velocity @xmath51 km s@xmath8 in the center of mass rest frame , best reproduces the main features observed in x - ray maps , in particular the peculiar morphology of the x - ray emission associated with the main cluster , the relative surface brightness between the main and the sub - cluster , the shape of the shock front and of the contact discontinuity .",
    "although the low velocity run 1:6v2000 leads to a x - ray displacement closer to that observed by @xcite both in the main and in the sub - cluster , this model seems to be excluded on the basis of a pure morphological comparison with the observational data .",
    "indeed , the bullet seems to be much less bright than the center of the main cluster .",
    "[ masses ] compares the integrated mass profiles of the main and the sub - cluster for different mass models with the gravitational lensing results from @xcite and previous simulations by @xcite .",
    "the profiles inferred from observations are obtained by measuring the enclosed mass in cylinders centered on the southern cd of the main cluster and on the bcg of the sub - cluster .",
    "here we calculated the present time projected mass within cylindrical bins centered on the center of mass of the two clusters .",
    "the massive cluster run 1:6v3000big ( green lines ) , overestimates the cumulative profile of the main cluster , while an initial main cluster mass of @xmath52 ( 1:6v3000 , in red ) fits the observational points better than the large - mass - low - concentration model of @xcite in the central regions and underestimates the projected mass by less than @xmath53 between 250 and 450 kpc from the center .",
    "blue lines refer to run 1:3lfg where the main halo has the same dark matter mass than 1:6v3000 but lower baryonic fraction .",
    "it is interesting to notice that using almost the same initial sub - cluster mass ( the sub - cluster model in run 1:6v3000big and 1:3lfg only differs in the baryonic fraction ) we can nearly reproduce the observed projected mass in the bullet only in the case of a very massive host halo ( green dashed line , 1:6v3000big run ) which overpredicts the main cluster profile ( green solid line ) . on the other hand a smaller main halo  which better fits the observational data ( blue solid line )  associated with a similar sub - cluster mass ( 1:3lfg ) underpredicts the lensing results ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "our favourite run 1:6v3000 gives even lower projected sub - cluster mass estimates ( red dashed line ) and lies close to the model proposed by @xcite ( their sub - cluster mass is similar to the one used in our 1:6 models ) .",
    "these results seem to indicate that the mass of the sub - cluster is a significant part of the main cluster mass , with initial mass ratio between the sub and the main cluster much larger than 1:3 .",
    "@xcite successfully reproduces the projected mass associated with the sub - cluster only assuming very massive halos and high mass ratios .",
    "in particular the smallest mass ratio allowed by their models is 1:2.7 , with a main cluster and bullet mass of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "such high masses are however clearly incompatible with the values inferred by galaxy kinematics . in particular the virial mass derived by @xcite for the main cluster",
    "is @xmath56 ( comparable with the value obtained by girardi & mezzetti 2001 ) .",
    "they also measure the main cluster total r - band luminosity and find @xmath57 using @xmath58 to estimate the cluster mass @xcite we obtain @xmath59 .",
    "the bullet mass determination of @xcite is less reliable since it is based on only seven galaxies and on the assumption of equilibrium while the sub - cluster seems to be tidally perturbed beyond @xmath60 kpc from its center .",
    "they find @xmath61 . from the total r - band luminosity ( @xmath62 ) we get a value almost five times larger ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the bullet mass proposed by @xcite is even one order of magnitude larger than that obtained from weak lensing analysis ( @xmath64 ) of a new larger lensing field which covers most of the area occupied by the system ( clowe et al . in prep . ) . with such low mass ratios we can not reproduce the morphology of the x - ray maps ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ b>0 ] ) since the luminosity peak associated with the main cluster core is almost completely destroyed by the interaction .",
    "actually any attempt to derive the mass of the main and sub - cluster simply by projecting the mass of two isolated nfw halos and fitting the observed lensing data  like the analysis of @xcite  is going to provide wrong results . indeed , as we will show in section 4 , the dark matter profiles of the main and sub - cluster change significantly during the central phases of the interaction , with a density increase in the inner regions and a decrement beyond 0.3 @xmath38 .",
    "this effect , which characterizes both the main and the sub - cluster , is not related to stripping processes but can be explained by the fact that the two halos are strongly perturbed and can not be idealized as the sum of two isolated equilibrium models .",
    "fitting the projected cumulative mass around the centers of the two interacting clusters with nfw models we would overestimate either the virial mass or the concentration of the original clusters .",
    "= 8truecm    according to @xcite the line of sight velocity difference between the main and the sub - cluster is relatively small , about 600 km s@xmath8 , which implies that the encounter must be occurring nearly in the plane of the sky . in fig .",
    "[ inclination ] we show the x - ray surface brightness map of run 1:6v3000 when the orbital plane is viewed inclined by 45 degrees left ( top panel ) and down ( bottom panel ) . in the upper image the bullet ( which is closer to the observer ) appears to be much brighter than the main cluster while the contact discontinuity and the shock front are much rounder than in the case where the encounter is seen perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "such a large inclination has to be excluded by a comparison with observations .",
    "moreover , the line of sight velocity difference between the two clusters ( we assume the line of sight kinematics of the dark matter to be coincident with that of the stellar component observed by barrena et al .",
    "2002 ) is much larger than the observed one ( @xmath65 km s@xmath8 ) due to the fact that the main component ( @xmath66 km s@xmath8 in the center of mass rest frame ) of the sub - cluster velocity is oriented in the direction of the positive @xmath15 axis in the original face - on encounter .",
    "a velocity difference comparable to the observed one is reached for a right to left inclination of @xmath67 degrees . on the opposite",
    ", a top - down inclination of the plane of the encounter with respect to the line of sight ( bottom panel ) does not produce drastic changes in the morphology of the bow shock and of the edge of the bullet . indeed the main and the sub - cluster still lie close to the plane of the sky , but the relative surface brightness between the dense and the diffuse strongly emitting components at the center of the main system changes .",
    "in particular the peak of x - ray emission due to the presence of hot gas deposited by the sub - cluster within the core of the main cluster is now comparable with the main cluster x - ray peak .",
    "the difference in line of sight velocity in this case is only @xmath68 km s@xmath8 and would probably not be distinguishable with respect to a pure face - on encounter .",

    "the bullet is located at @xmath69 with @xmath15 increasing towards the pre - shock region .",
    "the general trend does not depend on the model and is comparable with the profile suggested by observations @xcite : all the simulations show an inner bump associated with the bullet and an outer one ( between @xmath70 and @xmath71 kpc ) caused by the shock . the abrupt jump at @xmath72 kpc is the shock front while the pre - shock region is well fitted by a two dimensional @xmath2-profile @xmath73^{-3\\beta + 1/2}$ ] . in the case of run 1:6 @xmath74 kpc , @xmath75 and @xmath76 erg s@xmath8 kpc@xmath77 . a different orientation ( @xmath78",

    "if cooling is activated the surface brightness of the pre and post - shock region is smaller , but the thickness of the shock - front and the jump in surface brightness are similar .    in order to calculate projected temperatures we need to define a weighting function .",
    "the emission weighted temperature @xmath79 was originally introduced to provide a better comparison between simulations and observations with respect to a simple mass weighted temperature definition and has been commonly used in the analysis of simulations @xcite .",
    "it assumes a weighting function proportional to the emissivity of each hot gas particle and is defined as @xmath80 recently @xcite have demonstrated that for clusters with a complex thermal structure the emission weighted temperature always overestimates the spectroscopic temperature obtained from x - ray observations due to fact that the source is not a single temperature plasma . for clusters with a temperature @xmath81 kev the discrepancy is @xmath82 .",

    "as fast as its dark matter halo in 1:6v3000 and even 500 km s@xmath8 faster in 1:6v2000 . for larger encounter velocities ( 1:6 )",
    "ram - pressure is more effective in slowing down the bullet even beyond the core radius of host cluster and the gaseous bullet is always slower than dark matter .",
    "* it has been already noticed by @xcite and @xcite that the sub - cluster velocities do not coincide with the shock velocity @xmath159 as measured by observers . in the case of the three runs ( 1:6v3000 , 1:6v2000 and 1:6clfg ) which",
    "best reproduce the projected temperature jump , the mach number and shock velocity determined using the rankine - hugoniot conditions across the shock discontinuity show a good agreement with the values provided by @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional shock velocity calculated by tracking the shock position as function of time is consistent with these values .",
    "we find that , although after the point of closest approach @xmath159 is always larger than the velocity of the sub - cluster dark matter halo , the difference depends on the model and becomes less significant for higher velocities .",
    "in particular in the high velocity run 1:6 the present time shock velocity is only @xmath122 higher than the dark matter bullet . *",
    "the collision produces a drastic increase in luminosity and temperature .",
    "the highest velocity impacts are associated with the largest increase in temperature ( and shocks ) and the smallest peaks in luminosity due to the fact that in high velocity encounters a significant fraction of the baryons stripped from the bullet are deposited at large radii within the main cluster .",
    "@xcite found that the bullet cluster lies on the @xmath4 relation for local clusters @xcite at very high temperature .",
    "we followed the evolution of the main cluster in the @xmath4 diagram during the different phases of the interaction and find that it moves roughly parallel to the @xmath4 relation for nearby clusters .",
    "the maximum temperature is reached at the point of closest approach and the peak in luminosity immediately afterwards , with a small delay which produces a knot in the diagram .",
    "the branch of the curve associated with the post core - core interaction is still parallel to the @xmath4 relation but shifted towards smaller luminosities with respect to the early increasing branch , due to the loss of gas beyond the virial radius of the main cluster .",
    "* after the encounter , as soon as the bullet is close or beyond the virial radius of its host system , the dark matter density profile of the main cluster does not deviate anymore significantly from the original one , while the gas profile becomes shallower in the central regions , with a large decrement in density observed only in run 1:3clfg .",
    "the situation changes drastically if we compare the density profiles of the initial systems with those at the present time , when the bullet is still located well within the virial radius of the main cluster . in this case",
    "the interacting systems are not in virial equilibrium and the dark matter densities of both , the main and sub - cluster , increase in the inner regions and show a decrement beyond 0.4 @xmath38 .",
    "comparing these present time profiles with nfw halos would give wrong estimates of the halo parameters . at a time corresponding to the present configuration",
    "the center of the host system is completely devoid of main cluster gas as a result of the displacement of the main cluster gaseous core by the bullet . on the other hand ,",
    "the baryons stripped from the bullet have replenished the central regions of the host .",
    "this is only a temporary situation however since a few gyrs later the main cluster gas falls back and becomes again the dominant component in the central regions , although a significant fraction of gas stripped from the bullet is still present .",
    "the final sub - cluster dark matter density profiles seem significantly affected by the interaction beyond their scale radius , where the isodensity contours are elongated and show a plateau .",
    "we would like to thank r. piffaretti , s. borgani , a. biviano , t. naab , a. maccio and m. girardi for useful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge t. quinn for support with the tipsy x - ray package and d. clowe for providing the upper panel of fig .",
