    "starburst galaxies can be grouped in two main families : the hii galaxies and the starburst nucleus galaxies ( sbngs ) .",
    "the former are small - mass and metal - poor galaxies , while the latter are more massive and metal - rich ( for a complete definition of starburst galaxies , see coziol et al .",
    "the astronomical community recognized quite early the peculiar nature of h ii galaxies and many studies have been undertaken to determine their characteristics .",
    "the origin of sbngs , on the other hand , was thought to be more straightforward to understand . as a consequence ,",
    "the basic characteristics of these galaxies are not as well determined and their nature is still in debate .",
    "for example , it was believed some twenty years ago that sbngs were `` old '' galaxies which were rejuvenated by inflow of matter resulting from interactions with other galaxies ( huchra 1977 ; tinsley & larson 1978 ) .",
    "but subsequent studies have shown that starbursts generally do not reside in high galaxy density regions ( salzer et al .",
    "1989 ; hashimoto et al . 1998 ; coziol et al .  1998b , 1999 ) , where conditions for interaction should be more favorable , and that only a fraction ( between 25% and 30% ) of the massive sbngs have obvious luminous companions ( keel & van soest 1992 ; gallimore & keel 1993 ; coziol et al .",
    "1995 ; coziol et al . 1997a , 1999 ; contini et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the frequency of interacting galaxies among sbngs may be higher however , if we assume that the morphological peculiarities often observed in these galaxies , are weak traces of past interactions ( keel & van soest 1992 ; coziol et al .",
    "1995 , barth et al . 1995 ) and that , consequently , many sbngs are the remnants of merging galaxies ( coziol et al .",
    "the assumption that sbngs result from accretions of smaller galaxies is supported by several facts : they are less chemically evolved than normal galaxies with similar morphologies and comparable luminosities ( coziol et al .",
    "1997b ) , they are predominantly early  type spiral galaxies ( coziol et al . 1997a ; 1998a ) and follow a luminosity  metallicity relation similar to that of elliptical galaxies ( coziol et al",
    ". 1998c ) .    the merger hypothesis , on the other hand ,",
    "does not completely explain the starburst phenomenon and it is probably also necessary to assume internal regulating star formation mechanisms , in order to extend the total lifetime of the starburst over a longer period than is usually assumed based on the dynamical time scale of a gravitational interaction between galaxies ( searle & sargent 1972 ; gerola et al .",
    "1980 ; krgel & tutukov 1993 ) . such mechanisms would explain why sbngs experienced more than one burst over the last few gyrs ( gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "1995 ; coziol 1996 ) .",
    "they would also explain why these galaxies do not produce supernovae at higher rates than normal ones ( turatto et al .",
    "1989 ; richmond et al . 1998 ; gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "1999 )    in principle , one could gain a better understanding of the nature and origin of sbngs by drawing a more complete picture of their chemical evolution .",
    "but this is a difficult task , which is further complicated by our relative ignorance of how the chemical evolution of normal spiral galaxies proceeds .",
    "the main difficulty is observational : building a reasonable scenario of the chemical evolution of galaxies generally requires observations of hii regions over a large range of wavelengths . for local galaxies , for example",
    ", uv observations are required for determining the abundance of carbon ( kobulnicky & skillman 1998 ) , while observations in the near infrared are needed for estimating the abundance of sulphur ( garnett 1989 ) . in metal - rich spiral galaxies ,",
    "an additional difficulty resides in the non observability of important nebular lines , like [ oiii ] at 4363  , without which the electron temperature of the gas can not be determined directly .",
    "many efforts have been devoted over the years to develop functional empirical techniques to circumvent the problems related to the determination of chemical abundances in galaxies ( pagel et al .",
    "1979 ; edmunds & pagel 1984 ; edmunds 1989 ; skillman 1989 ) .",
    "recently , thurston et al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter teh ) have extended these techniques and devised a new method for estimating nitrogen abundances in metal - rich galaxies . in this paper , we take advantage of this recent advance to determine the abundance of nitrogen in sbngs .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we identify the main source of excitation in our sample of sbngs , based on their location in three standard diagnostic diagrams .",
    "we then discuss , in section  3 , the legitimacy of applying to sbngs the empirical method designed for `` normal '' hii regions to determine their chemical abundances . in the sbngs",
    ", we took great care in verifying that no other sources of excitation like a hidden agn is present , which could complicate or even impede the abundance determination in these galaxies .",
    "having verified these points , we proceed in section  4 to estimate the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in a large sample of sbngs , comparing these abundances with those of normal hii regions in spiral galaxies . in section  5 ,",
    "we discuss two different scenarios for producing nitrogen in sbngs and examine their consequences for the origin of the bursts in these galaxies .",
    "a summary of our most salient results is presented in section  6 .",
    "the optical spectrum of a starburst galaxy is usually quite distinct from that of an agn .",
    "it resembles that of an hii region in our galaxy , where , as we know , the gas is photoionized by young o and b stars ( searle & sargent 1972 ; sargent 1972 ; huchra 1977 ; french 1980 ) .",
    "this conclusion applies to all the types of starburst galaxies known today ( salzer et al .",
    "1989 ; kim et al . 1998 ; coziol 1996 ; coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) , including those where the burst is located mostly in the central regions ( weedman et al .",
    "1981 ; balzano 1983 ) .",
    "but , because the physical conditions in the nuclei of galaxies are still poorly understood , one may wonder what kind of pathological phenomena the evolution of a powerful starburst in the center of a galaxy could develop ( weedman 1983 ; terlevich et al .",
    "1991 ) . this concern may partly be justified by observations .",
    "for example , the presence of low - intensity non - stellar activity in the center of normal galaxies is frequently suggested ( heckman 1980 ; peimbert & torres - peimbert 1981 ; vron et al .",
    "1981 ; rose & cecil 1983 ; filippenko & sargent 1985 ) and , in agns , traces of star formation occurring simultaneously with an active nucleus are sometimes noted ( shields & filippenko 1990 ; lonsdale et al . 1993 ; vron et al . 1997 ; gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "however , none of these observations constitutes definite evidence that an evolutionary connection between starburst and agn exists , and , even less so , explains how this evolution may proceed .",
    "-2 cm -2.cm    obviously , if a source of excitation other than star formation is active in sbngs , this will greatly complicate abundance determinations .",
    "it is thus essential to first establish the dominant excitation source ( o and b stars or an agn ) present in these galaxies .",
    "this is usually done empirically : one constructs diagnostic diagrams using several ratios of emission lines present in the optical spectra ( baldwin et al .",
    "1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 , hereafter bpt and vo ) . over the years",
    ", the use of diagnostic diagrams has been recognized as the most efficient method for classifying the different types of activity encountered in emission - line galaxies ( veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ; vron et al .",
    "1997 ; gonalves et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this is the method that we applied to identify the main source of excitation in our different samples of galaxies .    our sample of uv - bright sbngs",
    "was composed originally of 208 hii regions observed along the bars of 75 markarian barred galaxies ( see contini 1996 , contini et al .",
    "1998 and considre et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "from this sample , we rejected 48 hii regions because of their ambiguous classification in the three diagnostic diagrams .",
    "this same criterion was used by veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to build their sample of fir - bright sbngs .",
    "this criterion allows one to eliminate the so called `` transition '' galaxies , whose nature is not well determined ( vron et al .",
    "1997 ; gonalves et al . 1999 ; hill et al . 1999",
    "; doyon et al . 1999 ) .    for comparison , we used the sample of 83 fir - bright sbngs of veilleux et al .",
    "we also used the 70 hii regions observed by mccall et al .",
    "( 1985 ; hereafter mrs ) to represent normal hii regions . in all the samples ,",
    "the line ratios were corrected for internal reddening using balmer decrements .",
    "the three classical diagrams of [ oiii]@xmath2/h@xmath3 ( the excitation level ) as a function of [ nii]@xmath4/h@xmath5 , [ sii]@xmath6/h@xmath5 and [ o i]@xmath7/h@xmath5 for the various samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "note that , for the sake of clarity , these line ratios will hereafter be written without the wavelengths .",
    "agns ( seyfert 2s and liners ) are clearly separated from hii regions and sbngs ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1]a , d and g ) . in these diagrams ,",
    "the hii regions trace a sequence where the decreasing excitation is due to the increasing oxygen abundance ( mrs ; dopita & evans 1986 ) .",
    "in general , the sbngs trace a similar sequence , but slightly displaced towards higher emission - line ratios ( coziol et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "despite being slightly more luminous in the infrared , the fir - bright sbngs show optical spectral characteristics similar to those of the uv - bright sbngs .",
    "this is consistent with the similarities observed between these two types of sbngs in the fir and suggests that the two selection criteria ( uv- or fir - bright ) define mostly the same kind of galaxies ( coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) . a kolmogorov  smirnoff test performed on [ nii ] suggests , with a confidence limit greater than 99% , that the fir- and uv  bright sbngs come from the same population .",
    "the same test yields similar conclusions for [ oi ] and [ sii ] , but only with confidence limits greater than 90% and 80% respectively .",
    "the [ oi ] line is rarely observed in normal hii regions ( bpt ) , and it was not measured in the mrs sample .",
    "when it is measurable in starburst , its intensity is always weaker than in agns .",
    "this is because the [ oi ] line is produced only in regions of partial ionization which are much more extended in agns ( vo ) . in our sample of uv ",
    "bright sbngs , only a small fraction ( @xmath8 30% ) of the galaxies presents this line .",
    "we compare the few [ oi]/h@xmath5 ratios observed in the sbngs of our sample in fig .",
    "[ fig.1]h and i. log([oi]/h@xmath5 ) is on average @xmath9 , comparable to what is observed in the sample of fir - bright sbngs of veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and consistent with values found in normal hii regions ( bpt , vo ) .",
    "we conclude , on the basis of the three standard diagnostic diagrams , that the main source of excitation of the gas in sbngs is o and b stars , like in normal hii regions ( bpt ; vo ; gonalvez et al .",
    "1998 ; kim et al .",
    "1998 ) .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , even if the gas in sbngs is ionized by o and b stars , the spectra of these galaxies do show , however , an excess of nitrogen and sulphur emissions with respect to hii regions in the disk of normal spirals ( the mrs sample ) . before proceeding with the determination of abundances in sbngs , we will now discuss the possible causes of this phenomenon .",
    "note that because we do not have enough information to estimate the abundance of sulphur in our samples , our discussion will focus on nitrogen .",
    "an excess of nitrogen emission in the spectra of galaxies ( usually normal ones ) has been observed before ( see stauffer 1982 , and references therein ) and various hypotheses have been proposed to explain it ( e.g. kennicutt et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the simplest hypothesis , which can apply to sbngs , is that these galaxies possess an overabundance of nitrogen with respect to normal disk hii regions ( stauffer 1982 ) .",
    "such an overabundance has already been observed in the prototypical sbng ngc 7714 ( gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "1995 ) and some have suggested that it also happens in agns ( storchi  bergmann 1991 ; storchi - bergmann & wilson 1996 ; ohyama et al . 1997 ) .",
    "another possibility is that sbngs have an extra source of excitation .",
    "this , in fact , was the solution preferred by kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who suggested a hidden agn as the extra source . as proposed by lehnert & heckman ( 1994 )",
    ", shocks produced by supernovae or starburst winds could probably also do the trick . however , the extra excitation hypothesis is in contradiction with the use of emission  line diagnostic diagrams to classify activity types in galaxies .",
    "indeed , we remind the reader that we already eliminated from our sample all the cases which appeared ambiguous in these diagnostic diagrams . therefore ,",
    "if the excess emission observed in these galaxies is still due to a residual excitation effect , it would seriously question the use of these diagnostic diagrams for distinguishing between the different activity types in emission  line galaxies . at the present time",
    "however , there is no evidence that diagnostic diagrams can give a wrong classification ( bpt ; vo ; gonalvez et al . 1998 ; kim et al . 1998 ) .    as an alternative , shields & kennicutt ( 1995 ) have suggested that metal depletion occurring during dust formation could produce a slight extra excitation . at first",
    ", this seems perfectly applicable to the fir - bright sbngs .",
    "however , the fact that we do not observe any difference in the diagnostic diagrams between these dusty galaxies and their uv - bright counterparts suggests that dust does not play a significant role in producing the excess of emission in these galaxies .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the original analysis made by vo on the null effect of dust on the different line ratios used in the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "it is also consistent with the fact that the two types of sbngs have similar properties in the far - infrared ( coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "if the excess emission in the sbngs with respect to normal disk hii regions is due to a residual excitation effect , we can not use the empirical method devised by teh to determine the abundance of nitrogen in sbngs .",
    "in fact , we would even caution against using this method to determine the nitrogen abundance , as teh have done , in early - type spirals and the nuclei of normal galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to test thoroughly the different hypotheses for the origin of the excess emission .",

    "we have computed the mean values of [ nii ] , [ sii ] and [ oi ] ( relative to h@xmath5 ) in excitation bins of 0.4 dex .",
    "these mean values are given in table  1 and plotted in fig  [ fig.1]c , f and i. because we did not find any difference between the spectral characteristics of the fir- and uv - bright sbngs , we merged the two samples together for this analysis .    the mean excess of emission with respect to normal disk hii regions is about the same for nitrogen and sulphur , @xmath11 dex and @xmath12 dex respectively",
    "however , the difference in [ nii]/h@xmath5 stays almost constant while the difference in [ sii]/h@xmath5 increases with the level of excitation ( last column of table  1 ) .",
    "it also appears that [ nii]/h@xmath5 increases as the level of excitation decreases ( or as the oxygen abundance increases ) , while [ s ii]/h@xmath5 and [ oi]/h@xmath5 stay constant . in fig",
    "[ fig.1]c , f and i , it can be seen that [ nii]/h@xmath5 is correlated with [ o iii]/h@xmath3 , while [ sii]/h@xmath5 and [ oi]/h@xmath5 are not .",
    "this is confirmed with a confidence limit higher than 99% using a generalized kendall s tau correlation coefficient test .",
    "these different behaviors of the emission - line ratios with the level of excitation are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the excess of emission in sbngs is produced by an additional excitation effect . on the other hand , they are partly consistent with what is expected if these line ratios are sensitive to a variation of abundance . if nitrogen is produced by intermediate - mass stars while sulphur is produced by massive stars , the intensities of these two lines should not be correlated .",
    "the different behaviors of these two lines also suggest that , in sbngs , the abundance of nitrogen will increase with that of oxygen while the abundance of sulphur will stay constant , as is observed in normal disk h ii regions ( torres  peimbert et al .",
    "we will show later ( sect.5.1 ) that these behaviors are consistent with a scenario of successive bursts for the chemical evolution of sbngs .    to better understand the difference between sbngs and agns",
    ", we compare [ nii]/h@xmath5 with [ sii]/h@xmath5 in our different samples .",
    "the two line ratios are significantly higher in the liners and seyfert 2s than in the sbngs ( see fig .  [ fig.2]a and b ) . note that we can not distinguish between the two agn types in this diagram .",
    "the sbngs , on the other hand , are clearly separated from liners .",
    "some seyfert 2s have [ sii]/h@xmath5 ratios comparable to those of sbngs , but this is not a problem because seyfert 2s can be clearly distinguished from sbngs based on their higher excitation level in fig .",

    "[ fig.2 ] , we establish two regions in this diagram where the gas is excited by different mechanisms : agn vs photoionization by o and b stars . this separation is also consistent with the lower limits proposed by lehnert & heckman ( 1996 ) for the presence of diffuse ionized gas in the halos of edge - on starbursts .",
    "we test our separation criterion on the uv - bright sbngs and on the mrs sample of disk hii regions in fig .",

    ", we now verify that no other factors influence the line ratios under investigation .",
    "the sulphur lines , for example , are sensitive indicators of electronic density , and one could imagine that a variation of this density over the line of sight introduces spurious effects .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3]a , the three line ratios are independent of electronic density .    -2 cm -6.1 cm    another spurious effect will arise if the slit of the spectrograph covers regions with different physical properties , e.g. a central agn and a circumnuclear starburst region , producing intermediate values for the line ratios .",
    "the presence of such an effect can be tested by its dependence on redshift .",
    "if the physical conditions ( different sources of excitation or density layers ) change with radial distance , while the slit aperture remains constant , the line ratios will change with redshift . for example , an agn in the nucleus of each sbng would produce higher line ratios at low redshifts , because of the increasing contribution of the agn over that of circumnuclear hii regions ( storchi - bergmann 1991 ) .",
    "the contrary is expected for diffuse gas ( lehnert & heckman 1994 , 1996 ) ; the ratios would then increase with redshift due to the enhanced contribution of diffuse gas in the aperture .",

    "[ fig.7]c and d. the dispersion of nitrogen abundances in the fir - bright sbngs is remarkably small .",

    "but there is nothing which assures us that the solar value should be the standard in these objects .",
    "this result goes in the same sense as those based on studies of the metallicities of stars in the solar neighborhood : the most frequent metallicity ( estimated here by [ fe / h ] ) is around @xmath36 dex ( cayrel et al .",
    "1997 ) and the sun seems to have a higher metallicity than the majority of stars ( eggen 1978 ) .",
    "the fact that the n / o distribution for sbngs peaks at the solar value implies a slight overabundance of nitrogen with respect to normal disk hii regions .",

    "the sbngs , on the other hand , are more numerous among early - type spirals ( see coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) , explaining the observed higher abundance ratio in this sample .",
    "we conclude that our observations on the nitrogen abundance of sbngs are consistent with the chemical evolution of early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "it suggests that what we see could be the main production of nitrogen in the bulges of these galaxies .",
    "it is usually assumed that nitrogen is the product of the evolution of intermediate - mass ( @xmath44m@xmath47  m@xmath48m@xmath49 ) stars .",
    "consequently , the expected behavior of n / o as a function of o / h could be @xmath50 , @xmath33 or a mixture of both ( van den hoek & groenewegen 1997 ) .",
    "but a mixture of @xmath0 mode of production could also imply a contribution by massive stars .",
    "these two possibilities have very different consequences for the nature of sbngs .    in the literature",
    ", we find some cases where a temporary contamination of nitrogen by massive stars is suspected ( pagel et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the contamination is supposed to come from massive wolf - rayet stars .",
    "but evidence in favor of a significant contribution of nitrogen by massive stars is still weak ( esteban & peimbert 1995 ) . in a recent paper ,",
    "kobulnicky & skillman ( 1998 ) showed that , even in hii galaxies , which can be considered younger than sbngs , the nitrogen abundance seems to be correlated to the carbon abundance , which is inconsistent with a contribution by massive stars .",
    "for the more massive and evolved sbngs , a significant contribution of nitrogen by massive stars would imply major bursts of star formation , not much older than a few myrs .",
    "but , with the exception of the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , observations of sbngs do not support such a scenario .",
    "their relatively low h@xmath5 equivalent widths , reddish @xmath51 colors , l(h@xmath5)/l(ir ) and l(b)/l(ir ) luminosity ratios are more consistent with low - level bursts occurring on a long or recurrent mode ( coziol 1996 ) . in general , sbngs also have relatively low rates of supernovae ( turatto et al .",
    "1989 ; richmond et al . 1998 ; gonzlez  delgado et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is inconsistent with very young and massive bursts .",
    "another difficulty with the major burst scenario for sbngs is to identify the origin of such sudden and energetic events .",
    "the only mean we know of is interaction ( or merger ) between two massive spiral galaxies , like the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies for example .",
    "but most sbngs are relatively isolated and the origin of the bursts can not be blamed on a recent interaction with a nearby massive companion ( coziol et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ; contini et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the production of nitrogen by intermediate - mass stars is better documented and a more likely event . according to van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the bulk of nitrogen in galaxies is produced by agb stars during their thermal pulsing phase , when the stars lose most of their mass to the ism ( @xmath52 m@xmath49 for a 1 m@xmath49 star and @xmath53 m@xmath49 for a 6 m@xmath49 star ) .",
    "the low mass ( m @xmath54 m@xmath49 ) agbs contribute to he and c , while the high mass agbs contribute to he and n. the typical lifetime of a 4 m@xmath49 star is @xmath55 yrs , while that of a 8 m@xmath49 star is @xmath56 yrs ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ) .",
    "these time scales are much longer than the typical lifetimes of massive o and b stars .",
    "therefore , following this scenario , the bursts originate much further back in time , which solves the problem of the relative isolation .    according to the model of charlot and bruzual ( 1991 ) ,",
    "the early phase of a burst is dominated by massive stars of types o to b5 .",
    "the agb branch turns on after about 0.1 gyr . between 0.4 and 1.6 gyrs",
    ", the agb population accounts for @xmath57% of the bolometric luminosity , while massive stars of type b5 to a7 contribute @xmath58% .",
    "between 1.6 and 8 gyrs , the agb contribution drops to @xmath59% , and stars of type a7 to g0 dominate the main sequence .",
    "from this , we conclude that the main phase of production of nitrogen in a starburst should occur between 0.4 and 1.6 gyrs after the beginning of the burst ( this implies the evolution of stars from 8 to 3 m@xmath49 ) . now coziol ( 1996 )",
    "found that the star formation in sbngs was nearly constant over the last 2 - 3 gyr period .",
    "thus , if we assume a median age of 1 gyr for the bursts , 2 or 3 bursts ( or more if the bursts have shorter durations ) could be sufficient to produce the number of co - evolved intermediate - mass stars needed for the abundance of nitrogen observed today .",
    "-0.25 cm -4.2 cm -9.5 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] , we show schematically how a sequence of bursts could explain the production of nitrogen in the sbngs .",
    "our scenario is based on the analytical model presented in garnett ( 1990 ) .",
    "we assume that sbngs begin their chemical evolution with n / o and o / h ratios typical of hii galaxies .",
    "the first phase in their chemical evolution corresponds to an increase of o / h due to the evolution of massive stars . at the same time n / o decreases ( garnett 1990",
    "; olofsson 1995 ) .",
    "the second phase begins @xmath60 gyrs after the onset of the burst with the evolution of intermediate  mass stars . because these stars produce mostly nitrogen , only n / o increases during this phase .",
    "the second burst begins with an increase in o / h , but with a lower amplitude than in the first burst .",
    "indeed , models of sequential bursts in galaxies usually assume that the successive bursts will have decreasing intensities ( gerola et al .",
    "1980 ; krgel & tutukov 1993 ; marconi et al . 1994 : kppen et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the decrease in n / o during oxygen enrichment ( the slope of the vector ) is also smaller as it becomes more difficult to lower this ratio as the oxygen abundance increases ( garnett 1990 ) .",
    "again , about 0.4 gyr after the beginning of the second burst , the intermediate stars evolve and n / o increases , although not as much as in the first burst .",
    "the norms of the vectors in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] are related to the intensity of the bursts ; the stronger the burst , the higher the increase in o / h and n / o . the difference between the norm of the oxygen and nitrogen enrichment vectors should depend on the imf and on some other parameters related to the yields of the different stars .",
    "if we increase the number of bursts and assume that successive bursts are weaker and weaker , the sum of the vectors converges towards a line whose slope represents the mean increase of o / h and n / o in time , or in other words towards the @xmath33 relation . following this scenario , a constant star formation can be viewed as an infinite sum of very low - intensity bursts of star formation , explaining why normal disk hii regions follow the @xmath33 relation .",
    "-0.25 cm -4.2 cm -9.5 cm    one prediction of this model is that the deviation of the observed n / o ratio from the @xmath33 relation ( @xmath46(n / o ) ) will decrease with the age of starburst galaxies , or , equivalently , with the increase in metallicity . in fig .",
    "[ fig.9]a , we see that this prediction is satisfied in the sbngs . we have verified that there are no relations between the deviation @xmath46(n / o ) and the ratios [ nii]/h@xmath5 and [ sii]/h@xmath5 , which rules out a possible explanation of this behavior in terms of an excitation effect ( indeed , following the excitation hypothesis the points with higher @xmath46(n / o ) would also have higher excess of emission in nitrogen and sulphur , which is not observed ) .    the fact that the deviation in fig .",
    "[ fig.9]a is mostly positive could be explained by the different durations of the chemical evolutionary phases . because massive stars have very short lifetimes , the oxygen enrichment phase is almost instantaneous , and o / h rapidly reaches a maximum ( the tip of each horizontal vectors in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] ) .",
    "the lifetime of the stars producing nitrogen , on the other hand , spans a much larger range of values .",
    "the nitrogen enrichment probably increases rapidly at the beginning , but is prolongated over a longer period of time , as the lower - mass stars evolve . as a result , the top of each vertical vector in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] will always be much more populated , this phase representing a natural stable mode in the starburst s evolution .",
    "the above scenario for the formation of nitrogen in sbngs has some interesting implications that can be further tested . assuming that , in sbngs , carbon is mainly produced by intermediate  mass stars",
    ", we should observe a deficiency of c with respect to n , because the agb stars that produce the carbon have longer main sequence lifetimes than those producing the nitrogen .",
    "then , by comparing the abundance of c with that of",
    "n we could determine the age of the sequence of bursts , while by comparing the abundance of n to that of s , we could determine the intensity and imf of the bursts .",
    "of course , none of this will be observed if carbon is mainly produced by massive stars ( maeder 1992 ) , its abundance increasing with metallicity , which is indeed observed in irregular galaxies ( garnett et al .",
    "1995 ) and in the disks of _ normal _ spiral galaxies ( garnett et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we have shown in previous papers ( coziol et al .",
    "1997b , 1998c ) , that the most plausible hypothesis for explaining the nearby sbngs is that they are the result of mergers of small - mass and gas - rich systems , probably similar to the nearby hii galaxies , which took place sometime in the recent past .",
    "the nearly constant star formation rate over a few gyr period ( coziol 1996 ) and now the time delay implied for the production of nitrogen by intermediate - mass stars both suggest merger ages of the order of 2 to 3 gyrs . on a cosmological time scale , this corresponds roughly to redshifts z @xmath61 to 0.3 ( using h@xmath62 km s@xmath63 mpc@xmath63 and assuming @xmath64 ) in the past .",
    "our hypothesis for explaining the nearby sbngs predicts a population of merging galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "therefore , it is probably not a coincidence that we do find a substantial increase in the number of irregular blue star forming galaxies ( broadhurst et al .",
    "1992 ; cowie et al . 1996",
    "; fioc & rocca  volmerange 1997 ; lilly et al .",
    "1998 ) at these redshifts .",
    "some of these galaxies have characteristics which are consistent with our interpretation for the sbngs , either in terms of star formation ( guzman et al . 1997 ; glazebrook et al . 1998 ; fioc & rocca  volmerange 1997 ) or in terms of morphology ( colless et al . 1994 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; van den bergh et al .",
    "1996 ; teplitz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it is clear , on the other hand , that these pieces of evidence are not sufficient for identifying all the faint blue galaxies as the merging progenitors of the sbngs .",
    "there are still substantial problems to solve before understanding what the relation between these two phenomena could be .",
    "one of these problems , for instance , is the elapsed time between the two events . if some of the faint blue galaxies merged to form the nearby sbngs , they merged sometime between 2 or 3 gyrs ago .",
    "these time scales are much too long compared to the predictions of the best models of interacting - merging galaxies that we can find in the literature ( mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 for example ) .",
    "how could these galaxies sustain high rates of star formation over such long time scales ?",
    "we already proposed one solution , which is that the merging phase produces more than one burst of star formation .",
    "this could probably be achieved by introducing in the interacting - merging models different initial conditions , which would better suit the characteristics of proto - galaxies ( the merging galaxies are not massive spirals but small - mass , irregular , metal - poor and gas - rich galaxies ) , and by regulating the bursts of star formation with a mechanism like the feedback of supernovae ( gerola et al . 1980 ; krgel & tutukov 1993 ) or by repeating them in a sequence of mergers ( tinsley & larson 1979 ) .",
    "using the same empirical methods as for normal hii regions , we have estimated the n / o and o / h ratios of a sample of 243 hii regions observed in different sbngs .",
    "we have found clear evidence for an overabundance of nitrogen with respect to normal disk hii regions with comparable metallicities .",
    "the range of n / o values found in the sbngs is comparable to that observed in the bulges of early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "our observations are consistent with the discovery made by teh that the n / o ratios of h ii regions in the bulges of early - type spiral galaxies are higher than in late - type spirals . for the sbngs , this suggests that what we see could be the main production of nitrogen in their bulges .",
    "the most plausible hypothesis for the origin of nitrogen in sbngs is that it is the product of the evolution of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "these stars would have formed during a sequence of bursts extending over a few gyr period . following this scenario ,",
    "the origin of the bursts is located 2 to 3 gyrs in the past . on a cosmological time scale",
    "these time intervals correspond to redshifts z @xmath61 to 0.3 , where one observes a substantial increase in the number of star forming galaxies whose characteristics are consistent with our hypothesis .",
    "this implies that some of the faint blue galaxies observed at intermediate redshifts may have merged to produce the sbngs observed today .",
    "the possible affiliation of the nearby sbngs with the excess of blue galaxies in the field at intermediate redshifts suggests that the sbngs are not a peculiar phase in the evolution of galaxies , but the result of a process which was much more common in the recent past of the universe .",
