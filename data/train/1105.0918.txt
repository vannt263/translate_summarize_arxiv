    "the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass , or that gravity can be cancelled by transforming to a freely - falling frame , was tested within classical celestial mechanics to high precision by the end of the nineteenth century .",
    "after all , if mercury had a gravitational constant differing from ( say ) jupiter s by one part per million , mercury s orbit would not have fitted classical dynamics well enough to highlight the anomalous precession ( @xmath0 per century , or @xmath1 ) that was later explained by general relativity .",
    "the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) adds to the classical or weak equivalence principle the further physical postulate that special relativity holds locally in a freely - falling frame .",
    "a consequence of the eep is that the effects of gravity on test particles are fully described by endowing spacetime with a riemannian metric , and having the particles follow geodesics of that metric .",
    "a further consequence of the eep is that the temporal metric component is , to leading order , given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the newtonian potential .",
    "hence gravity causes time dilation .",
    "different aspects of the eep have been verified by multiple experiments , as reviewed extensively by @xcite . in particular",
    ", null - redshift experiments test that gravity whatever it does does the same to clocks of different types .",
    "pound - rebka experiments verify that , in a static gravitational field , time is dilated by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "gps satellites and binary pulsars are effectively freely - falling clocks moving at , where @xmath5 is the black - hole mass . ]",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , and exhibit time dilation of @xmath8 .    but excellent as the existing experiments on the eep are , it would be even nicer to have a laboratory with experiments on multiple materials , the whole freely - falling at relativistic speeds .",
    "in this letter , we suggest that the s  stars in the galactic - center region approximate such a laboratory .",
    "stellar spectra contain absorption lines from different atomic species , which can be regarded as different clocks .",
    "the eep asserts that special relativity holds in the star s frame for all atomic processes ( local lorentz invariance ) , irrespective of where the star is ( local position invariance ) , and these can be tested by observations of a single star .",
    "the remaining ingredient of the eep , namely that a freely falling frame does not itself depend on the composition of the star ( universality of free fall ) requires multiple stars .",
    "the nature of a violation of the universality of free fall is difficult to speculate on , however one could imagine for example , fits from different s  stars redshift curves all yielding different values for the black hole mass .",
    "such a deduction would signal a violation of the uff .",
    "going beyond the eep , yet another possibility is that a star with a relativistically significant gravitational self energy , i.e. , a pulsar , may give different results",
    ". such a result would be a violation of the strong equivalence principle .",
    "it is expected that a significant number of pulsars inhabit the inner milliparsec , and although none have yet been found , searches are currently underway@xcite .",
    "the s  stars achieve the highest speeds of any known geodesics .",
    "for example , s2 reaches @xmath9 at pericenter , which it last passed in 2002 and will again in 2018 .",
    "the pericenter speed is an order of magnitude faster than for known binary pulsars .",
    "the spatial scales at pericenter are of order a light day . hence ,",
    "even if the quantitative constraints are initially modest , the s  stars would test the eep at velocity and spatial scales not reached by other experiments .",
    "astrometric and redshift observations of the s  stars show them to be on orbits ( so far ) indistinguishable from pure keplerian @xcite .",
    "keplerian elements are known to high accuracy for many stars .",
    "for example , for s2 the orbital inclination is measured to be @xmath10 .",
    "expected relativistic effects have been discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "these include not only time dilation @xcite , but also secular orbit precession @xcite plus newtonian perturbations from other stars @xcite , kinematic effects due to space curvature and frame - dragging @xcite , and composite redshift perturbations including light - path effects @xcite .",
    "the eep implies a time dilation of @xmath11 .",
    "hence a spectral line intrinsically at @xmath12 will be redshifted to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 redshift is conventionally defined as @xmath15 .",
    "it is however , somewhat more convenient if one defines @xmath16 as the redshift , and we will do so . in any case , the @xmath17 term constitutes a redshift perturbation of @xmath18 and is the strongest relativistic perturbation . in other words , the leading - order perturbation due to relativity is time dilation on a keplerian orbit .",
    "space curvature perturbs the redshift at @xmath19 , frame dragging due to black - hole spin at @xmath20 , with additional physical effects continuing at higher orders @xcite .",
    "one way to test the eep would be to replace @xmath17 in equation  ( [ crux ] ) by @xmath21 and fit observed redshift curves for the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , this has already been attempted @xcite but the available data appeared not yet sufficiently accurate to overcome systematic uncertainties .",
    "we argue below that observations concentrated near pericenter will be particularly useful .",
    "relativistic perturbations to the s  stars increase with decreasing pericenter distance . in orbit",
    "fitting from spectroscopy , as one looks to stars with longer periods , the perturbations to the redshift from relativity become overwhelmed by perturbations due to massive perturbers .",
    "of all the compact objects orbiting the central black hole , we see only the brightest stars .",
    "thousands of solar masses worth of compact objects and a possibly significant dark matter component is expected to inhabit the inner arcseconds .",
    "our lack of understanding of the form of this extended system may play a significant role in obscuring relativistic perturbations for large orbits .",
    "however , current models for the newtonian perturbations are estimated to most likely be weaker than the time dilation effect for the shortest - period stars such as s2@xcite .",
    "hence we will disregard the the extended - mass component in our analysis .",
    "consider a star on a pure keplerian orbit .",
    "elementary celestial mechanics gives the position of the star parametrically , that is , both coordinates and time are expressed as functions of the so - called eccentric anomaly @xmath23 . at time @xmath24 the position of the star in its orbital plane is @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the period , @xmath27 is the eccentricity , while @xmath28 is the semimajor axis in units of the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "we now rotate the coordinate system , first by the argument of periapsis @xmath29 about the @xmath30  axis , then by the inclination @xmath31 about the new @xmath32  axis .",
    "the observer is now along the new @xmath30  axis .",
    "the redshift is @xmath33 where @xmath34 and we have introduced the coefficients @xmath35 which can be interpreted as the amplitudes of the classical and relativistic contributions to the redshift .",
    "we also note that @xmath36 above is the coordinate time of emission .",
    "the time of observation is of course @xmath36 plus the light travel time , whose varying part is the rmer time delay , which is the @xmath30 coordinate of the star @xmath37,\\ ] ] and can also be interpreted as the time - integral of the redshift .",
    "classically , the redshift curve determines only the combination @xmath38 , leaving the inclination unknown .",
    "hence , for a given redshift curve , the inferred orbital speed becomes infinite if the orbit is face - on .",
    "not surprisingly , relativity prevents that happening . from ( [ final_redshift ] ) and ( [ funky_parameters ] ) it follows that @xmath39 hence time - dilation breaks the inclination degeneracy if @xmath22 is known , or allows @xmath22 to be measured if @xmath31 is known from astrometry .",
    "it is worth mentioning that another way in which relativity can break the inclination degeneracy is through the well - known precession of @xmath40 per orbit . for binary pulsars ,",
    "the cumulative @xmath29 precession amounts to several degrees per year , allowing @xmath28 and hence @xmath31 to be inferred @xcite . for galactic - center stars , however , the @xmath29 precession builds up much more slowly . over a single orbit",
    "the redshift due to precession is @xmath41 because @xmath42 over one orbit .",
    "we treat the following seven parameters as unknown .    1 .   the period @xmath26 .",
    "an additive constant on @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   the eccentricity @xmath27 .",
    "4 .   the argument of pericenter @xmath29 , which along with the inclination @xmath31 sets the orbit orientation with respect to the observer .",
    "since the observer is on the @xmath30  axis , the nodal angle @xmath43 corresponds to a rotation around the line of sight , which leaves the redshift curve invariant .",
    "5 .   the intrinsic frequency @xmath12 .",
    "this is the absolute line calibration , plus any offset due to the observer s radial velocity .",
    "changing @xmath12 shifts the redshift curve vertically .",
    "the tangential motion of the observer is neglected here , since the sun s orbital speed of @xmath44 in the galaxy would contribute no significant doppler shift .",
    "6 .   a classical redshift amplitude @xmath45 . 7 .",
    "a relativistic redshift amplitude @xmath46 . in fact , @xmath47 form a degenerate trio and are absorbed into the non - degenerate dummy parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 via ( [ funky_parameters ] ) .",
    "astrometry independently measures the first four of these , as well as @xmath31 .",
    "astrometric observations also involve six other parameters : the position and proper motion of the galactic center on the sky , the distance to the galactic center , and @xmath43 .",
    "the mass of the black hole is not an independent parameter , since it is a function of @xmath26 and @xmath28 . for our purposes , only @xmath31 from astrometry",
    "is essential . in testing the eep , while we shall argue that observation of the star over a short time around pericenter suffices for spectroscopy , recovery of the inclination via astrometry can be done anywhere on the orbit .",
    "it is important to note @xmath12 and @xmath13 need not refer to a single spectral line .",
    "the spectra of s  stars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contain multiple features .",
    "most are early - type stars with h and he features , while about 10% are late - type stars with molecular and metal bands / lines and little or no h or he . hence , s - star spectra could , in principle , test the equivalence principle for multiple atomic processes .",
    "if the stellar atmosphere does not change appreciably over an orbit , an observed spectrum can be cross - correlated on a logarithmic wavelength scale with a spectrum observed at some other epoch , and the cross - correlation peak would directly give the redshift @xmath16 with @xmath12 an unknown constant . if different atomic / molecular species behave differently in a freely - falling frame , the shape of the cross - correlation curve would change . alternatively",
    ", multiple spectral features could be fitted simultaneously with variable redshift . we do not , however , attempt to model the observable spectra explicitly in this paper .",
    "we now simulate the recovery of @xmath22 as follows .",
    "we generate 10 mock redshift data points of s2 taken over two months at pericenter , plus four additional data points , at @xmath48yr around pericenter .",
    "the data are generated with @xmath49 , and orbital parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "to them we add gaussian random noise at a dispersion of @xmath50 , and then fit via the seven parameters .",
    "we then assume @xmath31 has been measured by astrometry and use ( [ strategy ] ) to recover @xmath22 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : getting_alpha ] ) shows an example for a few mock data realizations at a fixed accuracy , and figure ( [ fig : recovering_alpha ] ) shows the dependency of the recovered value of alpha with the data accuracy .     for ten mock data sets .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 is the slope of the lines in the above plot , and is recovered from mock spectroscopic data of 14 data points with accuracy @xmath50 , concentrated around pericenter .",
    "the horizontal lines are the upper and lower confidence levels for the recovered inclination from astrometry , taken from @xcite .",
    "the intersection point corresponds to the value of @xmath22 for which both datatypes agree on the inclination . ]",
    "level in the recovered value of @xmath22 for spectroscopic data of different accuracy . at each data accuracy level , we have performed the same procedure illustrated in figure [ fig : getting_alpha ] , except that 60,000 mock data realizations have been used . ]",
    "testing the equivalence principle using a combination of spectroscopy and astrometry seems possible in the near future . in comparing the spread in @xmath51 from mock data to the recovered value for @xmath31 from real astrometric data ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : getting_alpha ] ) , in testing the equivalence principle using s2 , the current accuracy available from astrometry sits at a comfortable level . spectroscopic accuracy of s2 at @xmath50 is not yet available , but seems plausible with future observations . for the late - type star s35 , which has a more favorable spectrum ,",
    "a fit error of @xmath50 has been achieved @xcite .",
    "we remark that any systematic errors that do not change between observations are harmlessly absorbed into @xmath12 .",
    "naturally , in detecting relativistic effects on s  stars , data during pericenter passage are of greatest value . with instrumentation currently available ,",
    "an observation program concentrated over two months during s2 s next pericenter passage ( 2018 ) will prove to be sufficient as a test for the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "figure ( [ fig : recovering_alpha ] ) argues that a small handful of spectral measurements of s2 at @xmath50 around pericenter imply a @xmath52 accuracy on @xmath22 of @xmath53 .",
    "the approach we have taken above focuses on the essentials .",
    "the degeneracy between @xmath22 , @xmath31 and @xmath28 for spectroscopy has been lifted by using astrometry only to provide @xmath31 . in practice ,",
    "all the parameters are fitted simultaneously to both astrometry and spectroscopy .",
    "we have done simulations to verify that when this is done , the degeneracy is implicitly broken by the mechanism highlighted in this letter .      1 .",
    "the combination of spectroscopic and astrometric s  star data provides us with the distance to the center of the galaxy .",
    "astrometry is sensitive to the angular size of the orbit , while spectroscopy on the physical size .",
    "the quotient is the distance to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the position of the observed line depends on the velocity of the bh - star system with respect to the earth .",
    "spectroscopy therefore has the power to determine our velocity with respect to the central black hole @xcite , thus constraining the @xmath54 component of the galactic local standard of rest .",
    "the form of the mass distribution within the inner arcsecond affects the s  star orbits",
    ". a better understanding of the density profile will provide insight into the region s star capture and formation history , and to the central dark matter distribution @xcite .    in exploring 1 and 2",
    ", one can not easily avoid relativity simply by considering stars with larger orbit sizes ( 3 ) , as perturbations due to the enclosed mass become a problem . with the accuracy regime that spectroscopy will enter in the the coming decade ,",
    "one of two types of perturbations to the redshift must be faced : either those from the extended mass distribution , for s  stars with large orbits , or , those perturbations from relativity , for smaller orbit s  stars . while effects due to relativity are well understood in principle , and can be easily treated , the constitution of the extended system is poorly understood , and expects a more grueling treatment . in the coming decade , spectroscopic s  star accuracy at @xmath55 is expected to be available , and the discovery of stars closer in to the black hole is anticipated . in light of these prospects , so that constraints on these quantities may be improved , relativistic perturbations , while interesting in their own right , can no longer be ignored and must be faced ."
