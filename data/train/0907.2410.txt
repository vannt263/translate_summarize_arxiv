    "an unconventional superconducting state with a non  zero total momentum of the cooper pairs was predicted by fulde and ferrell @xcite as well as by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite in the middle of 60 s . under particular conditions",
    ", this phase should occur at low temperatures and in strong magnetic fields . due to sever requirements for the formation of the fflo state ,",
    "this type of superconductivity has experimentally been observed only recently . in the fflo state",
    "the superconducting order parameter ( op ) oscillates in the real space .",
    "this property , to some extend , resembles the unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems @xcite , where the op changes sign in the momentum space .",
    "the fflo state has recently been analyzed in the context of heavy fermion systems @xcite , organic superconductors @xcite , ultracold atoms @xcite and a dense nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "although , there is no direct experimental evidence for the spatial variation of the op , suggestions for the future experiments have been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the orbital ( diamagnetic ) pair breaking is a crucial mechanism that limits realization of the fflo state . in the vast majority of superconducting materials",
    "it is a dominating pair breaking mechanism that destroys superconductivity for magnetic fields much weaker than the clogston - chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "it holds true also for models appropriate to describe the short coherence length superconductors @xcite .",
    "the significance of the diamagnetic pair breaking is usually described in terms of the maki parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the upper critical field calculated without the zeeman splitting .",
    "there exist two general possibilities to reduce the destructive role of the orbital pair breaking . in the layered superconductors , formation of landau orbits",
    "should be suppressed for magnetic fields applied parallel to the layers .",
    "this may explain possible observations of the fflo state in some organic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the role of the orbital pair breaking should also be limited in systems with narrow energy bands , like heavy fermion systems .",
    "the experimental evidence for the fflo superconductivity in these systems seems to the strongest @xcite .    in the context of recent investigations of the fflo state ,",
    "it is important to search for other mechanisms that stabilize superconductivity against the orbital pair breaking .",
    "recently it has been found that superconductivity originating from repulsive pair hopping interaction is unique in that it is robust against this pair breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "the origin of this interaction may vary in different systems and therefore we do not specify a particular superconductor for which the following qualitative analysis can directly be applied .",
    "the repulsive pair hopping interaction can be derived from a general microscopic tight  binding hamiltonian @xcite , but in this case the magnitude of the interaction is very small . however , since this interaction leads to superconductivity that is almost unaffected by the orbital effects , it may become more important close to the upper critical field , i.e. , in the regime where the fflo phase is expected to occur .",
    "we may also consider other sources of the pair hopping which give rise to much larger magnitudes of this interaction .",
    "for example , such term may be included in the effective hamiltonian describing fermi gas in optical lattice in the strong interaction regime @xcite .",
    "it also arises in a natural way in multiorbital models @xcite , though then the pairs hop between different orbitals on the same site .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that some of our conclusions can still be valid .",
    "the role of the pair hopping interaction in a multiorbital models is of particular interest because of its presence in the recently discovered iron ",
    "pnictides @xcite . additionally , if the on  site repulsion exceeds the gap between the lowest and the next  lowest bands in optical lattice , then the interband pair hopping seems to important .",
    "very recent quantum monte carlo calculations for tmtsf - salt @xcite also suggest a significant role of the pair hopping processes in this system , which , on the other hand , probably exhibits the fflo phase at high field @xcite .    in the absence of magnetic field ,",
    "the pair hopping interaction is responsible for the @xmath1type pairing where the total momentum of the paired electrons is @xmath6 and the phase of superconducting order parameter alters from one site to the neighboring one @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that flux quantization and meissner effect appear in this state @xcite .",
    "therefore , even in the absence of external magnetic field , the repulsive pair hopping interaction favors pairing with non  zero momentum of cooper pairs .",
    "although , the pair hopping may not be the dominating pairing mechanism , its presence may affect the fflo phase . in the following",
    ", the superconducting state with zero total momentum of the cooper pair will be referred to as the bcs superconductivity . in that sense , both fflo and @xmath1pairing will be considered as a non  bcs state .    in the present paper , we analyze the role of the repulsive pair hopping interaction for the fflo state . the above mentioned systems , where the pair hopping interaction may play a significant role , exhibit both inter  site pairing ( cecoin@xmath0 , tmtsf ) as well as on  site pairing ( optical lattice , the iron ",
    "pnictides ) .",
    "therefore , we consider a model where this interaction coexists with on  site or inter  site pairing potential",
    ". however , we do not refer to any particular system .",
    "as the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in most of the unconventional superconductors is still under debate , we do not discuss the origin of the pairing potentials .",
    "for the system with on  site pairing , magnetic field reduces the total momentum of electrons forming cooper pairs in the @xmath1pairing state . as a consequence ,",
    "the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter becomes a site dependent quantity .",
    "recent theoretical investigations of the fflo phase in the attractive hubbard model have been motivated mostly by the increasing interest in the ultracold fermi gases @xcite .",
    "these approaches may also be applicable to compounds other than the strongly correlated heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "contrary to this , experimental results obtained for the cecoin@xmath0 indicate on the anisotropic @xmath2wave pairing . therefore in sec .",
    "we study the case of inter ",
    "site attractive interaction that is responsible for the @xmath2wave superconductivity .",
    "we show for the case of inter  site attraction that @xmath2wave and",
    "@xmath1pairing orders may coexist in the fflo state .",
    "such a coexistence is possible also for systems which in the absence of magnetic field are in the pure @xmath2wave state .",
    "for on  site and inter ",
    "site pairings , the potential of the pair hopping interaction @xmath7 is assumed to be positive .",
    "we start our analysis with a model with on  site pairing interaction described by the following tight  binding hamiltonian :    @xmath8   c_{i \\sigma}^{\\dagger } c_{i \\sigma } , \\label{h1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the nearest neighbor hopping integral , @xmath7 is the pair hopping interaction , @xmath10 is the chemical potential , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the zeeman coupling is determined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath15 is the bohr magneton and @xmath16 is the external magnetic field",

    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of the influence of this mechanism on the fflo state . here",
    ", we focus on the role of the pair hopping interaction as well as on the properties of the @xmath1pairing , that is robust against the orbital pair breaking .",
    "nevertheless , the role of the orbital pair breaking will be briefly discussed . in this section",
    "we assume the simplest form of the _ effective _ on  site pairing interaction ( @xmath17 ) , that is responsible for the @xmath18wave superconductivity .",
    "we apply the mean field approximation and assume the order parameter in a general form : @xmath19 then , the hamiltonian in the momentum space takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 for arbitrary lattice geometry the dispersion relation is given by @xmath22 , where the prime means summation over the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "we have also introduced an effective pairing potential @xmath23    for a general form of the order parameter [ eq .",
    "( [ parporz ] ) ] diagonalization of the mean field hamiltonian usually can not be reduced to an eigenproblem of a finite hermitian matrix .",
    "therefore , we restrict further discussion to two simplest cases . the first one was originally proposed by fulde and ferrel ( ff ) , whereas the second by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) . in the former one",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath24 , so the absolute value of @xmath25 is constant , but the phase changes from site to site . in the latter case @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then , one gets @xmath29 , where we use @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that at low temperature and high magnetic field fflo phases with @xmath32 may be thermodynamically more stable @xcite .    for the ff phase",
    ", the mean field hamiltonian can be diagonalized by means of the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "straightforward calculations lead to the following form of the grand canonical potential @xmath33 @xmath34   \\nonumber   \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\bm k } \\tilde{\\varepsilon}_{-{\\bm k}+{\\bm q } \\downarrow } - nu_{\\mathrm{eff}}({\\bm q } ) | \\delta_{0 } |^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of lo superconductivity , the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized analytically . however , the pairing term links the one  particle states with momenta lying along a single line in the brillouin zone .",
    "therefore , one can solve the resulting eigenproblem numerically for relatively large clusters .",
    "namely , for a @xmath36 cluster , one has to diagonalize a @xmath37 hermitian matrix .",

    "[ fig2 ]     but for a triangular lattice . ]",
    "we start our discussion with the simplest case @xmath24 ( ff state ) , that allows one to estimate the boundaries of the non - bcs superconducting phases .",
    "however , the presence of the lo superconductivity will be discussed as well .",
    "the thermodynamically stable phase has been determined through minimization of the grand canonical potential with respect to the superconducting order parameter @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the calculations have been carried out for a square lattice with @xmath48 as well as for a triangular lattice with @xmath49 .",
    "these chemical potentials correspond to maxima in the density of states and , therefore , to the highest superconducting transition temperatures .",
    "a comparison of results obtained for both the cases allows one to check the role of the lattice geometry .",
    "first , we focus on the influence of the pair hopping interaction on the properties of the fflo phase . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows how the ground state of the system depends on @xmath7 and @xmath38 . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( square lattice ) and [ fig3 ] ( triangular lattice ) we present the values of @xmath47 that minimize @xmath50 for some particular values of @xmath7 and @xmath38 . in the absence of the magnetic field",
    "there are two stable superconducting phases for both the lattice geometries . for small @xmath7",
    "there exists an isotropic bcs phase , that will be referred to as @xmath18wave superconductivity ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig3]a ) .",
    "the @xmath1pairing phase occurs for larger @xmath7 . in the case of a bipartite square lattice",
    ", @xmath1pairing corresponds to the total momentum of cooper pairs @xmath51 , where the phase of superconducting order parameter changes from one lattice site to the neighboring one ( see fig . [",
    "stability of this phase obviously follows from the fact , that the pair hopping interaction involves sites , which belong to different sublattices .",
    "then , the oscillating @xmath52 minimizes the energy of the system , for the physically relevant repulsive interaction . in this context , the problem of @xmath1pairing on a non  bipartite triangular lattice is interesting even in the absence of magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we have found that also for this geometry , the repulsive pair hopping interaction may lead to thermodynamically stable phase with @xmath53 .",
    "the ground state energy is minimal when @xmath47 represents one of the corners of the hexagonal first brillouin zone ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "it is easy to check that for such a value of @xmath47 , the phase of @xmath52 takes on three different values , namely , @xmath54 , @xmath55 or @xmath56 depending on @xmath57 . in the presence of sufficiently strong magnetic field there",
    "exist four different superconducting phases .",
    "apart from the discussed above @xmath18wave and @xmath1pairing states there are other two phases , that will be referred to as fflo1 and fflo2 .",
    "investigation of the total momenta of cooper pairs ( see panels `` b '' and `` d '' in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) , allows one to link fflo1 and fflo2 to @xmath18wave and @xmath1pairing , respect what , in turn , is a hallmarkively .",
    "namely , @xmath47 obtained for the fflo1 is relatively close to the origin of the brillouin zone , whereas in the fflo2 phase @xmath47 remains on the edges of the zone .",
    "one can see , that fflo2 phase occurs for lower magnetic fields than the fflo1 .",
    "fflo1 evolves from the s - wave superconductivity when sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied .",
    "it holds true for both the lattice geometries . on a square lattice",
    ", fflo2 evolves from the @xmath1pairing state under the same conditions .",
    "however , on a triangular lattice this phase is stable only for moderate values of the pair hopping interactions as well as for moderate magnetic fields .",
    "it is surprising that increasing of magnetic field may cause two phase transitions , the first one from @xmath18wave to fflo2 is discontinuous and the second from fflo2 to @xmath1pairing is a continuous transition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we have also found that the transitions from the s - wave phase to the fflo1 state are discontinuous , whereas the transitions from the fflo1 and fflo2 phases to the normal state are continuous .",
    "finally , for a square lattice the transition from the @xmath1pairing state to the fflo2 phase is discontinuous as well .",
    "the field dependence of the superconducting order parameter in various phases can inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    in the absence of the pair hopping interactions",
    ", it is well known that the lo phase has lower ground state energy than the ff one @xcite . in our case",
    ", this result directly applies to the fflo1 phase .",
    "we have found that in the case of fflo2 , state with @xmath26 has energy lower than that with @xmath24 . therefore ,",
    "also in this case @xmath58 is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "this result has been obtained on the basis of numerical diagonalization of @xmath59 clusters with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , there exists a simple criterion to distinguish between fflo1 and fflo2 phases . in both the cases @xmath60 but @xmath61 for fflo1 , whereas @xmath62 for fflo2 .",
    "therefore , the periods of spatial modulations of the order parameters relevant to fflo1 and fflo2 are very different . in the latter case",
    "it is of the order of the lattice constant .",
    "it is instructive to examine in more detail the spatial modulation of @xmath52 in the fflo2 phase on a square lattice . as the total momentum of cooper pairs @xmath63",
    "is close to @xmath64 , one can introduce @xmath65 and note that @xmath66",
    ". then , @xmath67= \\cos ( \\bm \\pi \\cdot \\bm r_i)\\cos ( \\bm q ' \\cdot \\bm r_i ) $ ] .",
    "the spatial profile of @xmath52 is determined by two oscillating functions .",
    "due to the first one the phase of the superconducting order parameter alters from one site to the neighboring one .",
    "it means that the fflo2 phase retains the basic properties of the @xmath1pairing superconductivity .",
    "the second factor is responsible for a slow variation of the magnitude of superconducting order parameter @xmath58 what is a hallmark of the lo  type of superconductivity . on the basis of our analysis",
    "one can not exclude that the fflo2 phase with @xmath68 is more stable .",
    "therefore , the actual boundaries of the fflo2 state may cover a slightly wider range of magnetic fields , than presented in fig .",

    "this problem has been analyzed , e.g. , in refs . @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , it is the dominating pair  breaking mechanism for @xmath18wave and fflo1 superconductivity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is very ineffective in destroying @xmath1type superconductivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that fflo2 will also be robust against the orbital pair breaking",
    ". this property may lead to significant modifications of the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "namely , the dashed lines show the boundaries of the @xmath1 and fflo2 types of superconductivity obtained under the assumption that @xmath18wave and fflo1 phase are destroyed by orbital effects .",
    "note , that even weak pair hopping interaction should lead to the onset of @xmath1 and fflo2 phases for fields sufficiently strong to destroy the conventional superconductivity .",
    "however , this conjectural result should be confirmed by calculations for the fflo2 phase with the diamagnetic pair breaking explicitly taken into account .",
    "finally , we discuss the standard @xmath70 phase diagram for a square lattice with @xmath69 .",
    "it is the value of pair hopping interaction for which the ground state in the absence of magnetic field is the @xmath1type superconductivity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the results .",
    "it is interesting that despite unconventional character of the @xmath1pairing , the phase diagram is very similar to analogous phase diagram for bcs  fflo superconductors .",
    "namely , the fflo2 phase occurs only in the presence of strong magnetic field and at low temperatures .",
    "the phase transition from @xmath1 to fflo2 phase is discontinuous , whereas the transition from fflo2 to the normal state is continuous .",
    "in this section we extend our previous study by allowing for the anisotropic @xmath2wave superconductivity . for this sake , we add the nearest  neighbor attraction term to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) @xmath71 where we assume @xmath72 . for simplicity ,",
