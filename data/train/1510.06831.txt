    "atoms and ions containing exotic particles like muon , kaon , taon , baryon and their antimatters are of immense have become an interseting research topic in many branches of physics including atomic , nuclear and elementary particle physics , plasma and astrophysics , experimental physics [ 1 - 2 ] . out of the many probable species ,",
    "the muonic helium atom ( @xmath4he@xmath5 ) formed by replacing an orbital electron of neutral helium is the simplest one which can be treated as a three - body atomic system [ 3 ] was first formed and detected by souder et al [ 4 ] .",
    "muon being about 207 times heavier than an electron , the size of the muonic helium atom is smaller by a factor of about 1/400 of the ordinary electronic helium atom .",
    "similar arguments hold for ( @xmath6he@xmath5 ) also .",
    "several reasons have been stated in the literature regarding the importance of these exotic atoms : i ) muonic helium atoms are the unusual pure atomic three body systems without any restriction due to pauli exclusion principle for electron and muon being non - identical fermions .",
    "ii ) these are the by - products of the process of muon catalyzed fusion and study of these may yield useful information to understand the fusion reactions properly [ 5 - 6 ] .",
    "iii ) the electromagnetic interaction between the electron and negatively charged muon can be better understood by this simplest muonic system by precise measurements of hyperfine structure [ 7 - 8 ] of the ground - state , in terms of interaction between the spin magnetic moments of muon and electron .    as exotic particles",
    "are mostly unstable , their parent atoms ( or ions ) are also very short lived .",
    "these exotic short - lived atoms or ions can be formed by trapping the accelerated exotic particles inside matter and replacing one or more electron(s ) in an ordinary atom by exotic particle(s ) .",
    "the absorbed exotic particle revolves round the nucleus of the target atom in orbit of radius equal to that of the electron before its ejection from the atom . which subsequently cascades down the ladder of resulting exotic atomic states by the emission of x - rays and auger transitions before being lost on its way to the nucleus .",
    "if the absorbed exotic particle is a negatively charged muon , it passes through various intermediate atmospheres before being trapped in the vicinity of the atomic nucleus [ 9 ] .",
    "in the course of its journey inside the matter , it scatters from atom to atom as free electron and gradually loses its energy until it is captured into an atomic orbit . in the lowest energy level ( 1s ) , it experiences only coulomb interaction with nuclear protons while it experiences weak interaction with the rest of the nucleons . on the other hand",
    "if the exotic particle is a hadron like a kaon , pion or anti - proton , the cascade ends earlier in all exotic atoms except the lighter ones with atomic number 1 or 2 , due to nuclear absorption or annihilation of the particle by the short - range strong interaction . as discussed above , exotic atoms ( or ions ) are produced by replacing one or more electron(s ) of neutral atoms by one or more exotic particle(s ) like muon , pion , kaon , anti - proton having an electric charge equal to that of the electron [ 10 ] .",
    "the most studied exotic few - body coulomb system are the muonic atoms ( or muonic ions ) which are formed by removing one or more orbital electron(s ) by one or more negatively charged muon(s ) .",
    "however the present communication we shall consider only those atoms or ions in which the positively charged nucleus is being orbited by one electron and one negatively charged muon . by far exotic muonic atoms were widely used to probe a number of atomic properties including nature and strength of eletron - muon interaction [ 11 ] , these were considered an effective testing probe to study the electromagnetic properties of nuclei [ 12 ] . a number of observables like magnetic hyperfine structure by johnson and sorensen [ 13 ] , isotopic shifts in muonic spectra of isotopes of the chemical elements like ca , cr , cu , mo etc by macagno et al [ 14 ] , perturbation calculation for hyperfine structure of muonic helium atom ( @xmath7he ) , lamb - shift in the muonic deuterium ( @xmath8d ) by krutov and martynenko [ 15 ] have been studied .",
    "frolov studied bound - state properties of @xmath6he@xmath9 and @xmath4he@xmath9 [ 16 ] and beryllium - muonic ions [ 17 - 18 ] with high accuracies .",
    "flambaum [ 19 ] in 2008 investigated the effect of bound muons , pions , kaons etc on the fission barrier and stability of highly charged nuclei .",
    "in addition to ongoing projects many new experiments have been proposed in muon science laboratory , riken [ 20 ] .",
    "some physical aspects of the reaction and dynamics of muonic helium atom as a classical three - body problem have been described by sutchi et al [ 21 ] .",
    "experimental investigation on the reactions of muonic helium and muonium with h@xmath10 by donald g fleming and co - workers [ 22 ] have been reported in the literature , although there may be more reported works in this direction .    out of several theoretical methods applied to study the bound state properties of the atomic few - boy systems some may include integral differential approach by sultanov et al [ 23 ] , potential harmonic approximation approach by yalcin et al [ 24 ] , faddeev approach by dodd [ 25 ] , angular correlated configuration interaction ( acci ) approach by rodriguez et al [ 26 ] , smith jr et al [ 27 ] , variational expansion approach by frolov [ 16,18,28 - 31 ] , and by frolov et al [ 32 - 36 ] .",
    "variational calculation for muonic few - body systems was initiated in the sixties by halpern [ 37 ] , carter [ 38 - 39 ] and delves et al [ 40 ] . later in the late eighties kamimura [ 41 ]",
    "used variational method for the bound d- state in @xmath11 .",
    "in the early eighties vinitsky _ et al _ [ 42 ] used non - variational approach for the muonic molecular ions . in the last decade of the twentieth century ,",
    "krivec and mandelzweig [ 43 ] performed a non - variational precision calculation for muonic helium atom ( @xmath4h@xmath12 ) employing the correlated function hh method .",
    "we adopt hyperspherical harmonics expansion approach to the ground state of atoms/ ions containing an orbital electron plus a negatively charged muon revolving round the positively charged nucleus thereby forming a three - body system .",
    "we assume the model to be valid for the electromagnetic interaction of the valence particles with the nucleus which is sufficiently weak to influence the internal structure of the nucleus .",
    "again , the fact that the muon is much lighter than the nucleus allows us to regard the nucleus to remain a static source of electrostatic interaction .",
    "however , a hydrogen - like two - body model , consisting a quasi - nucleus ( @xmath13 , formed by the muon and the nucleus ) plus an orbital electron can also be tested .",
    "this is because the muon being about 200 times heavier than an electron , has an orbital radius of about 1/200 times that of an orbital electron .",
    "hence , there is a fair possibility of forming the said quasi - nucleus .",
    "in hhe formalism , for a general three - body system consisting three unequal mass particles the choice of jacobi coordinates correspond to three different partitions and in the @xmath14 partition , particle labeled by @xmath15 remains as a spectator while the remaining two particles labeled @xmath16 and @xmath17 form the interaction pair .",
    "thus the total potential contains three binary interaction terms ( i.e. @xmath18 ) and for computation of matrix element of v(@xmath19 ) , potential of the @xmath20 pair , the chosen hh is expanded in the set of hh corresponding to the partition in which @xmath21 is proportional to the first jacobi vector [ 44 ] by the use of raynal - revai coefficients ( rrc ) [ 45 ] .",
    "the energies obtained for the lowest bound s - state is compared with the ones of the literature .    in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the hyperspherical coordinates and the scheme of the transformation of hh belonging to two different partitions .",
    "results of calculation and discussions will be presented in section iii and finally we shall draw our conclusion in section iv .",
    "the choice of jacobi coordinates for systems of three particles of mass @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the jacobi coordinates [ 46 ] in the @xmath14 partition can be defined as : @xmath25   ^{\\frac{1}{4 } } ( \\vec{r_{j } } - \\vec{r_{k } } ) \\\\",

    "i , it can be seen that at @xmath105 , the energy of the lowest bound s - state of @xmath112 @xmath107he@xmath113 converges up to 3rd decimal places and similar convergence trends are observed in the remaining cases .    furthermore , although an easy computation of the matrix element of @xmath114 in the partition @xmath46 \" is possible by the method of ref.[61 of 47 ] , it is not so easy for potentials other than coulomb or harmonic type . for",
    "an arbitrary shape of interaction potential , a direct computation of the matrix element of the potential will involve five dimensional angular integrations which lead the calculation very time consuming and leaves windows open for inaccuracies to creep in easily .",

    "is plotted against @xmath115 to demonstrate the relative convergence trend in energy .",
    "the calculated ground state energies muonic three - body systems of different nuclear charge z ( and of infinite nuclear mass ) , have been plotted against z as shown in figure 4 to study the dependence of the bound state energies on the strength of the nuclear charge using data from table ii .",
    "the curve of figure 4 shows a gradual increase in energy with the increase in the strength nuclear charge z approximately following the empirical equation @xmath117 eq .",
    "( 21 ) may be used to estimate the ground state energy of muonic atom / ions of given z having infinite nuclear mass .",
    "finally , in table ii , energies of the lowest bound s - state of several muonic three - body systems obtained by numerical solution of the coupled differential equations by the renormalized numerov method [ 55 ] have been compared with the ones of the literature wherever available . since reference values are not available for systems having nuclear charge @xmath118 , we made a crude estimation of the ground - state ( @xmath119 ) energies following the relation @xmath120(a.u.)\\ ] ] where a is the mass number of the nucleus .",
    "here we assumed two hydrogen - like subsystems for the muonic atom / ions .",
    "in conclusion , we note that the calculated ground - state energy of muonic helium and muonic lithium at @xmath105 listed in column 2 of table ii are greater than the corresponding reference values listed in clolumn 4 of table ii . this dicrepancies may have arose due to the cusp condtions applicable to coulomb systems which have not been accommodated in the present calculations .",
    "it can be seen that the estimated energies ( @xmath121 ) in column 2 of table ii are less than the corresponding calculated energies ( @xmath122 ) in column 3 of table ii for systems having @xmath123 while the same for @xmath124 becomes larger than @xmath122 .",
    "the facts indicate a weaker correlation betwen electron - muon pair in systems having nuclear charge @xmath125 while a stronger correlation in systems having @xmath124 .",
    "the fully converged extrapolated energies ( @xmath126 ) in column 4 of table ii , obtained for a very large @xmath115 following prescription of [ 47 ] are larger than the estimated values ( @xmath121 ) in all cases . which indicates that the electron - muon repulsion term plays a vital role in the binding mechanism of the electron - muon - nucleus coulomb three - body systems .",
    "it may also be noted that the rrc s being independent of r , needs to be calculated once only and stored , resulting in an efficient and highly economical numerical computation .",
    "finally , it may be mentioned here that in the cases of higly charged muonic ions relativistic correction term has to be introduced to get the best results .",
