    "the magneto - optic effects and electro - optic effects can be used to explain the birefringent phenomenons and the rotation of polarized plane in the optical medium .",
    "the magneto - optic effect includes the larmor precession @xcite , zeeman effect @xcite , and faraday effect @xcite in the magnetic field .",
    "the larmor precession is the precession of the magnetic moments of charged particles in the external magnetic field .",
    "the zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field , while the faraday effect is an interaction between the light and magnetic field in a medium .",
    "the electro - optic effect involves the stark effect @xcite , pockels effect @xcite , and kerr effect @xcite in the electric field .",
    "the stark effect is the electric analogue of the zeeman effect , and is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of charged particles in the external static electric field .",
    "the pockels effect originates the birefringence in an optical medium , and the birefringence is proportional to the electric field , whereas in the kerr effect it is quadratic in the field .    at present two theoretical methods have been proposed to explain the above optic effects .",
    "the theoretical basis of the magneto - optic effects was developed by j. maccullagh @xcite , g. b. airy , j. c. maxwell @xcite , and h. a. rowlland @xcite etc .",
    "while the refringent index ellipsoid approach @xcite was presented to describe the electro - optic effects .    in the magnetic field , when the magnetic moment is placed in the magnetic field , it will tend to align with the magnetic field , that is the magnetic field exerts a torque on the magnetic moment .",
    "the larmor precession can explain the zeeman effect .",
    "the latter is important in the applications , including the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , the electron spin resonance spectroscopy , and the magnetic resonance imaging etc .",
    "the zeeman effect encompasses the inverse zeeman effect , anomalous zeeman effect , and paschen - back effect @xcite etc . and",
    "it can be used to understand qualitatively the circular birefringence in the faraday effect , in which the rotation of polarized plane is proportional to the intensity component of the applied magnetic field in the direction of light beam .",
    "the faraday effect corroborates that the light and electromagnetism are related .",
    "its theoretical explanation is that light waves is decomposed into two circularly polarized rays with different speeds in the medium , and then the difference of speeds will cause a net phase offset and result in a rotation angle of linear polarization .",
    "in the electric field , the stark effect includes its first - order , second - order , and inverse effects .",
    "the first - order stark effect is linear in the applied electric field , while the second - order stark effect is quadratic in the field .",
    "the pockels effect can explain some birefringent phenomenons in the crystals and noncentrosymmetric media , including the lithium niobate , gallium arsenide , electric - field poled polymers , and glasses etc .",
    "meanwhile the kerr effect may unpuzzle the some double refractions in the solid and liquid dielectrics , when the change of refractive index is directly proportional to the square of the electric field .",
    "all materials show a kerr effect , but certain liquids display it more strongly than others .",
    "however it is evident that there is not the electric analogue of the larmor precession in the electric field .",
    "and the stark effect seems to be independent of the pockels effect as well as the kerr effect theoretically .",
    "this situation is quite distinct to that in the magneto - optic effects , and it is an unsymmetrical case .    in the electromagnetic and gravitational fields described with the algebra of octonion @xcite , the magneto - optic effects , electro - optic effects , and some new optic effects can be deduced from the same force definition in the octonion space .",
    "especially the electro - optic effects can be derived from the new force terms , including the stark effect , pockels effect , and kerr effect etc .",
    "one more interesting result is that the gravitational field has also an influence on the orientational rotation of linearly polarized light in the long - distance transmission .",
    "the algebra of quaternions @xcite was first used by j. c. maxwell to describe the electromagnetic theory . at present the gravitational theory",
    "can be depicted with the quaternion also .",
    "but the quaternion space for gravitational field is independent to that for electromagnetic field @xcite , and these two quaternion spaces are perpendicular to each other , according to the spacetime equality postulation @xcite .",
    "two quaternion spaces can be combined together to become one octonion space , consequently the properties of gravitational field and electromagnetic field can be described with the algebra of octonions at the same time .",
    "the force terms of electromagnetic and gravitational fields can be defined from the torque and the energy in the octonion space .",
    "this force definition covers all known force terms in the classical theories , including the inertial force , newtonian gravitational force @xcite , coulomb electric force , lorentz magnetic force @xcite , gradient of energy , and interacting force between the magnetic strength with magnetic moment , etc .      in the octonion space , we can define the linear momentum . in the quaternion space for the gravitational field ,",
    "the basis vector is @xmath0 = ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , the radius vector is @xmath5 = ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , and the velocity is @xmath10 = ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . in that for the electromagnetic field ,",

    "the radius vector @xmath33 in the octonion space is @xmath34 and the velocity @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the time ; @xmath11 is the speed of gravitational intermediate boson , @xmath26 is the speed of electromagnetic intermediate boson ; the symbol @xmath30 denotes the octonion multiplication .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath39 combines with electromagnetic potential @xmath40 to become the octonion field potential @xmath41 . while the field strength @xmath42 consists of gravitational strength @xmath43 and electromagnetic strength @xmath44 , with the gauge @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is one coefficient for the dimensional homogeneity . @xmath49 , with @xmath50 . @xmath51 .",
    "the gravitational strength @xmath43 includes two components , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 meanwhile the electromagnetic strength @xmath44 involves two parts , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57    .[tab : table1]the octonion multiplication table . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the electromagnetic field and gravitational field described with the algebra of octonions , the magneto - optic effect and electro - optic effect are derived from the same force definition formula . in the octonion space , the zeeman effect is deduced from the terms @xmath58 , faraday effect from the term @xmath59 , stark effect from the terms @xmath60 , and pockels effect from the terms @xmath61 .",
    "moreover the rotation of linearly polarized light is affected by the force terms regarding the gravitational field also .",
    "the above theoretical explanation is different to the classical index ellipsoid approach .",
    "this work indicates that the above inferences will be impacted by not only the refractive index and field energy but also the field strength and other factors . and that the gravitational strength @xmath62 and @xmath63 will affected the orientational rotation of linearly polarized light , although the rotation affection may be quite tiny .",
    "however in the universe space the rotation angle of the gravitational affection may be distinct enough to be detected due to the long distance transmission .",
    "it should be noted that the study for the optic effects impacted by the force terms examined only some simple cases under the octonion force definition came from the torque and energy . despite its preliminary character , this study can clearly indicate that the magneto - optic effect and electro - optic effect both can be derived from the same one force definition in the electromagnetic field and gravitational field . for the future studies , the research will focus on the theoretical explanations about the birefringent phenomenon in the optical medium as well as the experimental validations of the rotation of linearly polarized light in the gravitational field .",
