    "the red dwarf binary system gj65  consists of two active flare m stars , bl cet and uv cet , in a wide orbit ( @xmath0 yr ) .",

    "we take advantage of the recent refinement of the fundamental parameters of gj65  by interferometry and high - contrast imaging @xcite and an accurate spectroscopic determination of the rotational properties of the components @xcite to characterise magnetic field strength and topology in both stars .",
    "these direct constraints on the surface stellar magnetic field are essential for understanding dynamo action in fully convective stars and interpreting activity patterns of the gj65  components .",
    "high spectral resolution circular polarisation observations of gj65a and b were obtained with the espadons spectropolarimeter attached to the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the binary system was observed on the night of sep 21 , 2013 , when 4 spectra of gj65a and 4 spectra of gj65b were recorded , and on the night of sep 24 , 2013 , when another 4 spectra of gj65b were obtained . according to the orbital parameters derived by @xcite , the projected separation of the components was 2.2  at the time of espadons observations , implying that the stars were well isolated by the 1.6  instrument aperture .",
    "each spectropolarimetric observation of gj65ab consisted of four 480  s sub - exposures obtained with different polarimeter configurations .",
    "the resulting stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra , retrieved from the cfht science archive , were reduced by the upena pipeline using the libre - esprit software @xcite .",
    "these spectra cover the 3701050  nm wavelength interval at a resolution of about @xmath3 and have a peak signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 200300 per pixel .    the information about individual observations of gj65ab are provided in table  [ tbl : obs ] , which lists the mid - exposure times , snrs , and rotation phases calculated with the period of @xmath4  d for gj65a and @xmath5  d for gj65b @xcite",

    "the quality of espadons polarisation observations of gj65  is insufficient for an analysis of polarisation signatures in individual spectral lines .",
    "consequently , we applied the least - squares deconvolution procedure ( lsd , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to derive high snr mean stokes @xmath2 profiles based on a line mask containing 1690 atomic absorption lines deeper than 0.2 of the continuum .",
    "the lsd atomic line mask was derived from a line list retrieved from the vald3 database @xcite using @xmath19  k , @xmath20 marcs model atmosphere @xcite .",
    "application of lsd yielded a snr gain of about 20 , allowing to detect circular polarisation signals in all observations of both components .",
    "examination of the lsd stokes @xmath2 profiles of gj65a and b reveals a stark difference between the two stars . as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : zdi ] , the primary shows low - amplitude polarisation signatures which change significantly from one observation to the next . on the other hand ,",
    "the secondary consistently exhibits morphologically simpler and stronger antisymmetric signatures indicative of a positive large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the mean longitudinal magnetic field @xmath6 , estimated from the first moment of the stokes @xmath2 lsd profiles @xcite and reported in the last column of table  [ tbl : obs ] , ranges from @xmath21 to @xmath22  g for gj65b and from 0 to @xmath23  g for gj65a .",
    "we further analysed the stokes @xmath2 lsd profiles of gj65  with the zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) inversion technique to obtain detailed field topology models .",
    "zdi was previously applied to a sample of active m dwarf stars of different masses by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed global fields with strengths up to several kg and demonstrated that early - m , partially convective dwarfs typically have weak and complex magnetic field structures while mid - m stars tend to show strong axisymmetric dipolar field topologies , and late - m , fully convective dwarfs exhibit a mixture of both types of field geometries ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "our zdi analysis of gj65  was carried out with the code described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar to the latter paper , the local stokes parameter profiles were approximated with the unno - rachkovsky solution of the polarised radiative transfer equations @xcite .",
    "the central wavelength and effective land factor of the model profiles were adopted according to the average values of the lsd line mask ; the line strength was adjusted to match the equivalent width of the observed lsd intensity profile .",
    "the magnetic field was represented using a spherical harmonic expansion , with the maximum angular degree @xmath24 .",
    "the magnetic inversions were regularised by penalising a contribution of higher @xmath25 modes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this magnetic mapping methodology is very similar to previous applications of zdi to active mid- and late - m dwarfs @xcite with the exception that here we do not apply global field filing factors to improve the fit to the observed stokes @xmath2 profiles . furthermore , since observations of gj65  cover about 1014% of the rotation cycles of the components , we accounted for the phase smearing by integrating the model lsd profiles over appropriate phase intervals .",
    "the 8 spectropolarimetric observations of gj65b have an adequate phase coverage to obtain a detailed map of the surface magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the 4 spectra available for gj65a cover only about half of the rotational period .",
    "nevertheless , this data set is sufficient to derive an approximate zdi map that can be meaningfully compared with the inversion results for gj65b .    taking into account results of the stokes @xmath1 di modelling by @xcite ,",
    "we adopted projected rotational velocities @xmath26=28.6  kms@xmath27  for gj65a and 32.0  kms@xmath27  for gj65b , respectively , and an inclination angle of @xmath28 for both stars .",
    "this value agrees within error bars with the inclination angles which follow from the above @xmath26 , the rotation periods determined by @xcite , and the radii measured by @xcite .",
    "the global magnetic field maps of gj65ab are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : zdi ] along with a comparison of the observed and computed lsd stokes @xmath2 profiles .",
    "it is evident that the large - scale field of gj65b ( peak local strength 2.34  kg , mean strength 1.34  kg ) is considerably stronger than the field of gj65a ( peak local strength 0.84  kg , mean strength 0.34  kg ) .",
    "the field of gj65b is also predominantly dipolar ( 92% of the field energy is contained in @xmath29 components ) and axisymmetric ( 89% of the energy is in @xmath30 components ) .",
    "in contrast , the field of gj65a has a larger contribution of higher-@xmath25 ( 70% of the energy is in @xmath29 components ) and non - axisymmetric ( 56% of the energy is in @xmath30 components ) modes .",
    "the fields of both stars are largely poloidal ( 8993% of the energy is in poloidal components ) .",
    "details of the field topology of gj65a are less precisely determined than for the b component due to an incomplete phase coverage obtained for the primary .",
    "nevertheless , the basic conclusion that the primary s field structure must be less axisymmetric and more complex is supported by the complex stokes @xmath2 lsd line shapes observed at phases 0.533 and 0.638 .",
    "such stokes @xmath2 profile morphologies are not observed in any of the 8 observations available for gj65b .",
    "an analysis of zeeman broadening and intensification of spectral lines enables an estimate of the total magnetic flux , which contains contributions of both the large - scale field and the small - scale magnetic structures unresolved by polarimetry .",
    "previous studies applied this diagnostic method to atomic and molecular lines in the stokes @xmath1 spectra of many low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , detecting fields with typical strengths of 24  kg @xcite . in a recent study by shulyak et al .",
    "( in prep . , see also summary in @xcite ) magnetic fields of up to 6.4  kg were found in several active , rapidly rotating ( @xmath31=0.40.8  d ) m46 dwarfs .",
    "the gj65  components are spinning about a factor of two faster than any of the m dwarf stars with direct magnetic field measurements in the literature .",
    "our field strength measurements take advantage of a group of lines at @xmath32 97449788   .",
    "these lines correspond to the transitions between similar energy levels , hence the relative scale of their oscillator strengths , obtained from vald , is well - known .",
    "one of these lines , 9743.61    has zero effective land factor , meaning that this spectral feature is entirely insensitive to magnetic field .",
    "then , a magnetic field strength can be determined using a differential spectrum synthesis analysis of magnetically sensitive lines , e.g. 9770.30 , 9783.31 , 9787.69   , relative to 9743.61   .",
    "this magnetic intensification diagnostic does not rely on interpreting details of the line profile shapes and therefore can be applied to rapidly rotating stars , such as the gj65  components .",
    "some of the lines mentioned above are significantly affected by the telluric absorption features .",
    "we used the molecfit tool @xcite to model the telluric spectrum and remove its contribution from stellar observations .",
    "then , the 4 spectra of gj65a and 8 spectra of gj65b were averaged , yielding high - quality intensity spectra for each star .",
    "the magnetic field effects on the lines were studied with the help of the synmast code @xcite , which solves the polarised radiative transfer equation at several limb angles for a given line list , model atmosphere , and prescribed magnetic field strength and orientation . in this study",
    "we adopted a homogeneous radial magnetic field .",
    "this assumption has no bearing on the final analysis results since the disk - integrated stokes @xmath1 spectra are not particularly sensitive to the field orientation and , in any case , sample a wide range of field orientations with respect to the observer for any field geometry .",
    "based on the radii and masses given by @xcite , we adopted @xmath33=5.1 for both components of gj65  and used the solar - metallicity marcs model atmospheres with @xmath34=3000  k for the primary and 2900  k for the secondary .",
    "the probable effective temperature uncertainty of @xmath35100  k does not introduce significant differential effects for the studied lines .",
    "for both gj65a and b our spectrum synthesis reproduces the observed width and intensity of 9743.61    with the solar abundance of titanium and @xmath26 given by @xcite . at the same time , the three other lines are clearly too weak without a magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ti ] ) . adjusting the field strength to match the observed intensity of each of these lines",
    "separately , we found @xmath36=@xmath37  kg for gj65a and @xmath36=@xmath38  kg for gj65b , with the error bars corresponding to the scatter of measurements derived from individual lines .    as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : ti ] , theoretical spectrum for a 5  kg field covering the entire stellar surface provides a satisfactory fit to all lines in gj65a .",
    "however , magnetically sensitive lines in gj65b exhibit a more triangular shape than predicted by calculations .",
    "this anomaly is not observed for the 9743.61    line in gj65b and is not seen for any of the lines in gj65a .",
    "this suggests the presence of a strong - field component in the field distribution in gj65b , which is responsible for the extended wings of magnetically sensitive lines . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we applied to both stars a two - component model fit , combining a non - magnetic spectrum with calculations for a given field strength covering a fraction @xmath39 of the stellar surface .",
    "this model succeeds in improving the fit to gj65b spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ti ] ) , yielding @xmath40=@xmath41  kg , @xmath39=@xmath42 and @xmath36=@xmath43=@xmath44  kg . on the other hand , results of the two - component model fit for gj65a ( @xmath40=@xmath45  kg , @xmath39=@xmath46 and @xmath36=@xmath43=@xmath47  kg ) are compatible with the single - component fit .",
    "these results were obtained using the mean spectra of gj65ab .",
    "we have also examined individual observations , finding no appreciable variability of the lines in gj65a .",
    "the secondary component , on the other hand , shows a weak rotational modulation of line shapes .",
    "this variability , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] , appears to be magnetic in nature because it is absent in the magnetic null line 9743.61    but present in other transitions .",
    "fitting the phase resolved spectra of gj65b with the two - component model described above reveals a coherent , single - wave variation of @xmath40 from 8 to 11  kg and @xmath36  from 5.7 to 7.0  kg , with the maximum of both parameters occurring at phase 0.5 . to our knowledge , this is the first report of a rotational modulation of the magnetic field intensity derived from stokes @xmath1 spectra of an m dwarf .",
    "in this letter we analysed the global magnetic field topology and measured the total magnetic flux for both components of the well - known active m dwarf binary gj65 .",
    "the components of this system , bl  cet and uv  cet , are the fastest spinning fully convective stars for which direct magnetic field measurements are now available . despite similarity of their fundamental parameters and spin rates ,",
    "these stars exhibit drastically different global magnetic fields .",
    "the secondary , uv  cet , has a strong , axisymmetric dipolar field .",
    "the primary , bl  cet , has a more complex global field structure , with the magnetic energy more than an order of magnitude weaker than for uv  cet .",
    "this difference in the global field organisation may be responsible for a significantly different radio and x - ray variability of the two stars , with uv  ceti being both more luminous and variable @xcite .",
    "our results thus suggest that the radio and x - ray behaviour of gj65b is linked to an extended magnetosphere anchored in its strong global field , which gj65a lacks .",
    "the puzzling finding of very different global fields in nearly identical objects demonstrates that the dynamo in fully convective stars is not a straightforward function of fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "the co - existence of different types of large - scale fields in similar late - m dwarfs was previously found by @xcite based on a heterogenous sample of objects with uncertain relative ages and evolutionary histories .",
    "our finding of the discrepant global fields in well - characterised , coeval components of gj65  strengthens these results and lends support to the hypothesis of convective dynamo bistability @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the coexistence of different types of field topologies in m dwarfs with similar fundamental parameters was suggested by @xcite .",
    "these authors argued that m dwarfs have magnetic cycles and observations of qualitatively different field geometries correspond to different phases of these cycles .",
    "however , the consistently discrepant radio behaviour of the gj65  components , which appears to be linked to their different global field configurations , has been observed since the first high angular resolution radio studies of gj65  @xcite .",
    "this implies that any cyclic evolution of the global field in gj65ab must occur on a time scale longer than @xmath3530 yr .    at the same time , complementary analysis of the total magnetic flux reveals a different perspective on stellar magnetic fields .",
    "similar to previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that up to 95% of the field energy is contained in small - scale field .",
    "moreover , the total mean field strengths derived for gj65a and b ( 5.2 and 6.7  kg respectively ) are similar , although there is an evidence of different field strength distributions , with the field in gj65b featuring rotationally - modulated , strong - field component absent in gj65a . these results , inferred from the analysis of zeeman intensification , indicate that the discrepant global field topologies diagnosed by polarimetry are limited to superficial stellar layers and immediate circumstellar environment but do not encompass the bulk of the stars .",
    "this picture contradicts theoretical bistable dynamo models which predict a different total field strength and different internal field for the two dynamo branches @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite reported the same 1214% discrepancy between the observed and theoretically computed radii of the gj65  components . since the interior magnetic field is the most likely culprit for the inflated radii of active low - mass stars @xcite , gj65a and b should have comparable interior fields , which is in line with our finding of the similar total surface magnetic fluxes .",
    "this paper is based on archival spectropolarimetric observations obtained at the cfht which is operated by the national research council of canada , the institut national des sciences de lunivers ( insu ) of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii ."
