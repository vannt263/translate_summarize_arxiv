    "the lie action @xmath13 of @xmath0 on @xmath9 is @xmath14 it preserves the order filtration , and so one has the  modules @xmath15 note that for @xmath16 these are modules of @xmath17 order symbols .",
    "symbol modules are usually , so we may think of @xmath18 as the jordan - hlder length of @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the  is usually not completely reducible .",
    "the subject of the present article is the following `` equivalence question '' : when are two such s equivalent as modules of @xmath0 ?",
    "this question was first posed by duval and ovsienko @xcite , who answered it for modules of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "in fact they treated smooth s over arbitrary oriented manifolds , but it is a general phenomenon that the result depends only on the dimension of the manifold , and in the euclidean case it is the same whether one considers polynomial or smooth functions .",
    "duval and ovsienko observed a dichotomy between the 1-dimensional and multidimensional cases , due to the fact that for @xmath23 , the jordan - hlder  of @xmath19 is determined by the three parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath18 , while for @xmath26 it is determined only by the two parameters @xmath27 and @xmath18 .",
    "this in turn is because the symbol modules of @xmath28 are s for @xmath26 , but not for @xmath23 .    the work @xcite inspired several articles .",
    "( we note that some authors use a different sign convention , writing @xmath29 where we write @xmath30 . ) in the multidimensional case @xmath23 , lecomte , mathonet , and tousset @xcite determined the es of the modules @xmath21 for @xmath31 , and gargoubi and ovsienko @xcite did the same in the 1-dimensional case .",
    "genuine s were first considered by lecomte and ovsienko @xcite , who also made the natural and important generalization to s in the 1-dimensional case , allowing the order @xmath25 to vary continuously .",
    "they computed the es of the modules @xmath32 ( but only for generic values of @xmath25 when @xmath26 ) .    the equivalence question for arbitrary @xmath33 was first considered by mathonet @xcite and gargoubi @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "all @xmath0-intertwining maps between the modules @xmath11 are determined for @xmath23 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the question is not yet settled in the multidimensional case for genuine s @xmath19 .",
    "the classification of the @xmath0-maps from  modules @xmath11 to s @xmath34 , carried out in @xcite , is closely related .",
    "the equivalences among the modules @xmath35 are determined in @xcite .",
    "this article contains errors pointed out in @xcite which call the results at @xmath36 and @xmath37 or  @xmath38 into question , but in fact as we shall see here they are correct .    in all of these articles on the equivalence question",
    "there is a 1-parameter family of modules with any given composition series .",
    "the various answers obtained have a common trait : for small lengths  @xmath18 , modules with the same composition series are all equivalent excepting a finite number of special cases , while for larger lengths  @xmath18 , modules are equivalent only to their conjugates ( adjoints ) .",
    "the most interesting cases involve the critical intermediate lengths , which in these articles are always @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "in this article we consider the es of the modules @xmath41 , the most general 1-dimensional setting . here",
    "there is a two parameter family of modules with any given , which causes the critical length to increase to @xmath42 .",
    "at this length there is a new phenomenon : for each , the es are generically six pairs of conjugate modules , determined by the intersections of a certain pencil of conics with a certain pencil of cubics . during the course of the analysis we obtain results in lengths @xmath43 unifying the 1-dimensional results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    we have been unable to resolve the case of length  6 .",
    "we can reduce the equivalence question to the computation of a certain grbner basis , but the standard software packages were unable to find this basis on the computers available to us .",
    "we expect that there are only the obvious equivalences arising from conjugation and the de rham differential ; exceptional equivalences would be interesting .",
    "we have not resolved the case of length  7 either , but this will be much easier because one has six invariants rather than four . we can prove that in lengths @xmath44 there are no non - obvious equivalences , but we have not included the details here .",
    "we also study `` lacunary s '' , @xmath45-modules whose  are missing certain symbol modules .",
    "for example , the lacunary s of length  3 composed of the order  @xmath25 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 symbols have the same two parameters for each , and generically they are equivalent  their parameters lie on the same member of the pencil of conics involved in the @xmath42 case . on the other hand , the es of the lacunary s of length  4 composed of the order  @xmath25 , @xmath46 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49",
    "symbols are determined by a new pencil of conics .    as in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "our main tool is the _ projective quantization , _ the decomposition of @xmath50 under the action of the _ projective subalgebra _ of @xmath45 , a copy of @xmath51 .",
    "generically one has complete reducibility under this subalgebra , in which case it suffices to use the formulas for the action of @xmath45 with respect to the projective quantization deduced by cohen - tretkoff , manin , and zagier @xcite .",
    "the exceptions are the _ resonant _ cases , where we use the modifications of these formulas obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact we review these resonant formulas in more detail than is needed for the equivalence question in order to give them in a much simpler form ; see theorem  [ res cmz ] .",
    "one consequence of this simplification is corollary  [ b factors ] , which explains certain initially mysterious factorizations of the non - resonant formulas .",
    "the length  4 resonant case @xmath52 with self - dual  is particularly interesting .",
    "the special case @xmath53 of s was studied in @xcite : it is the only length @xmath43  for which there are no equivalences other than conjugation . here",
    "we see that in the more general setting of s , equivalence is determined by a single pencil of conics , not one of the pencils of conics arising at @xmath42 .",
    "a preliminary outline of these results was given in @xcite , and the non - resonant cases comprise the ph.d .  thesis @xcite of the second author .",
