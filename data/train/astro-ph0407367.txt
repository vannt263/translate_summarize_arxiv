    "now that we have become accustomed to referring to the hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies as `` cooling flows '' , no cooling gas has been observed .",
    "although energy is lost by x - ray emission , the absence of spectral evidence for gas cooling to low temperatures has been well - documented in many observational papers ( e.g. peterson et al . 2001 ; xu et al .",
    "the hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies may cool , but at a much lower rate than previously thought .",
    "this has led to numerous theoretical models in which the gas is assumed to be reheated in some fashion  by powerful radio jets , by rising bubbles , by shocks , by magic etc .",
    "most or all of these models have been unsatisfactory at some level .",
    "the most common difficulty of heated flows is not reproducing the observed radial temperature and density profiles ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 2002 , 2003 ) , which are smooth and approximately similar for galaxy clusters of all scales .",
    "less theoretical effort has been expended in understanding the radial abundance gradients in the hot gas , but it is fair to say that little progress has been made so far on this important problem .    in this paper we show that a combination of heating and radial mass redistribution can satisfy these stringent observational constraints and simultaneously explain the observed radial metallicity profiles . while the flows described here retain some useful features of traditional cooling flows , we refer to them as `` circulation flows '' since gas flows in both directions simultaneously .",
    "cooling to low temperatures is greatly or entirely eliminated .",
    "the primary source of heat that drives the circulation is assumed to be moderate agn activity in the cores of luminous elliptical galaxies that reside at or near the center of the diffuse x - ray emission in groups and poor clusters .",
    "our theoretical and observational studies of the viralized hot gas in galaxy clusters have been motivated in several ways .",
    "first , we have maintained that hot gas in galaxy groups is more likely to reveal the physical nature and dynamical evolution of the gas than hotter gas in rich clusters .",
    "we assume that some of the groups are old and , if cosmically isolated , are less likely to have been upset and mixed by recent mergers or powerful radio sources .",
    "second , we have argued that the radial variation of the gaseous iron abundance in these groups retains an imprint of the origin and dynamical evolution of the gas since it received its iron . finally , at the relatively low temperatures of gas in galaxy groups , @xmath3 kev , the influence of thermal conductivity @xmath4 on the scale of the flow can be ignored .    in many galaxy groups and clusters",
    "the gas - phase iron abundance has a noticeable peak centered on the central elliptical galaxy that extends out to @xmath1 kpc .",
    "the iron abundance increases to @xmath5solar at the center .",
    "xmm spectra indicate that 70 - 80 percent of this iron was formed in type ia supernovae .",
    "of particular interest for our discussion here is the realization that the total amount of gas - phase iron in this central region is comparable to the total amount of iron that could be created by all type ia supernovae in the central galaxy since its stars were formed .",
    "this is only possible if little or none of the iron - enriched gas has cooled .",
    "it is also significant that the region of enhanced iron emission around the central galaxy is much larger in extent than the half - light radius of the optical galaxy .    to explain these important features",
    ", we describe a simple time - dependent model for the long term evolution of hot gas in galaxy groups in which gas enriched by type ia supernovae inside the central galaxy is heated and buoyantly transported far into the surrounding gas where it is stored over time",
    ". meanwhile , most of the hot x - ray emitting gas loses energy and flows inward , as in a standard cooling flow .",
    "the cooling inflow receives both iron - enriched gas and energy from clouds or bubbles of heated gas that are moving outward . to avoid flows with catastrophic cooling or discordant temperature profiles , it is essential that the inflowing gas receive both energy and mass from the central regions .",
    "the physical nature of this heating ",
    "@xmath6 compression , sound wave dissipation , weak shocks , etc ,  is left unspecified for the time being . for successful flows",
    "the mass and energy deposition must be spatially broad , not concentrated near a single radius in the flow .",
    "this can be accomplished if inflowing gas arriving near the central galaxy is heated to a variety of entropy levels and ultimately floats upward approximately to that radius where its entropy matches that of the surrounding , inflowing gas .",
    "the discussion below is a time - dependent generalization of the steady state circulation flows that we discussed in a previous paper ( mathews et al .",
    "2003 ) . flows in which gas moves in both radial directions at each radius are notoriously difficult to reproduce faithfully even with the most sophisticated multidimensional numerical codes because numerical diffusion across the eulerian grid blurs the distinction between the counter - streaming flows .",
    "for this reason , in this initial study of the time - dependent evolution of radially circulating gas , we study the evolution of the inward flowing gas with a standard eulerian code , but simplify our treatment of the outflowing gas that is difficult to resolve on computational grids .",
    "the physical processes by which gas near the central elliptical galaxy is heated are left unspecified .",
    "some of the less important aspects of bubble dynamics that we discussed in our study of steady state circulation flows  such as momentum exchange by the drag interaction of rising bubbles , expansion of individual bubbles , etc  are either not treated in detail here or are represented by source terms in the equations for the inflowing gas . since the dynamical time for buoyant gas is much less than the radiative cooling time , we assume that heated outflowing clouds move rapidly to their final destination .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect that the detailed inclusion of these complications will alter the basic character  or the success  of the circulation flows described here .",
    "we show that time - dependent circulation flows can quite naturally produce all of the major observed radial profiles in the hot gas : its temperature , density and metallicity .",
    "in addition to these important attributes , our circulation flows are compatible with the x - ray observation that very little if any gas cools to low temperatures .",
    "a common feature of well - studied x - ray luminous galaxy groups is an extended region of enhanced iron emission surrounding the central elliptical ( e.g. buote et al .",
    "2003a , b ; sun et al . 2003",
    "; xue , bhringer & matsushita 2004 ; kim & fabbiano 2004 ) . typically , the iron abundance is near - solar within 30 - 40 kpc of the center and decreases outward within 100 - 150 kpc .",
    "the ratio of @xmath7/fe elements suggest that a large fraction of this iron has been produced by type ia supernovae ( sniae ) .",
    "today the stars in this region from which the sniae presumably occurred are located almost entirely within the central e galaxy with half - light radius @xmath8 kpc , much smaller than the scale of iron enrichment in the surrounding gas .",
    "for example , the x - ray luminous group ngc 5044 consists of a large elliptical galaxy surrounded by a cloud of much smaller galaxies extending to at least 400 - 500 kpc . at a distance of 33 mpc , the central galaxy has luminosity @xmath9 @xmath10 , effective radius @xmath11 kpc , and total stellar mass @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the stellar mass to light ratio .",
    "the galaxy is surrounded by a huge cloud of hot gas extending to at least 300 kpc . if the hot gas is assumed to have a single phase , its temperature rises from @xmath15 kev at the center to a maximum of @xmath16 kev at 40 - 80 kpc , then decreases slowly beyond ( buote et al .",
    "similar temperature profiles are observed in many other groups and poor clusters ( sun et al .",
    "2003 ; loken et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , within about 30 kpc the x - ray spectrum is fit better with two or more gas temperatures spanning the range @xmath17 kev ( buote et al .",
    "the low temperature component at @xmath18 kev dominates the emission in this region but only occupies @xmath19 of the volume out to 20 or 30 kpc .",
    "this suggests that the remaining volume is occupied by the hotter gas which must be buoyant if it is in pressure equilibrium .",
    "this conclusion is directly supported by the pronounced spatial irregularities visible in the chandra image of ngc 5044 ( buote et al .",
    "2003a ) .    the iron abundance in ngc 5044 decreases from @xmath20 solar near the center to @xmath21 solar at r = 150 kpc and remains approximately uniform beyond ( buote et al .",
    "2003b ; buote , brighenti & mathews 2004 ) .",
    "the total mass of iron observed within 100 kpc is @xmath22 @xmath13 and @xmath7/fe abundance ratios indicate that 70 to 80 percent of this iron has been produced in type ia supernovae .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the total mass of iron produced by sniae in the central e galaxy over cosmic time , @xmath23 in @xmath13 ( mathews 1989 ) where @xmath24 is in gyrs and @xmath25 gyrs is the current age of the universe .",
    "the iron yield of each type ia supernova is @xmath26 @xmath13 .",
    "we assume a type ia supernova rate of @xmath27 in snu units ( rate per 100 years per @xmath28 ) .",
    "the current type ia rate in early type galaxies is @xmath29 ( cappellaro , evans & turatto 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 variation is consistent with the @xmath31 variation observed by pain et al .",
    "( 2002 ) out to redshift 0.5 , although the exponent 1.2 is uncertain .",
    "suppose for example that most of the stars in ngc 5044 formed at cosmic time @xmath32 gyrs ( redshift @xmath33 ) and a 1 gyr delay preceded the first type ia supernova ( gal - yam & maoz 2004 ) . in this case",
    "the integration above begins at time @xmath34 gyrs corresponding to redshift @xmath35 .",
    "the integration predicts that @xmath36 @xmath13 of iron has been created by all sniae in the central elliptical ngc 5044 .",
    "it is remarkable that this estimate is comparable to the total mass of iron observed in the central iron peak out to 100 kpc , @xmath37 @xmath13 , suggesting that rather little snia iron is currently in the stars . at @xmath38",
    "kpc the iron abundance in ngc 5044 plateaus at @xmath39 solar ( buote , brighenti & mathews 2004 ) so it is natural to assume that the background gas was pre - enriched everywhere by type ii supernovae in the early universe to @xmath40 solar .",
    "the total iron mass from this background within 100 kpc is only @xmath41 @xmath13 , suggesting that 80 percent of the iron in the central peak is from type ia supernovae , which is consistent with x - ray spectra .",
    "while the uncertainty of past supernova rates certainly tempers our estimate of the total iron mass from sniae , its similarity to the observed mass has important implications for the global gas dynamics .",
    "very recently , de grandi et al . ( 2004 ) have shown that the mass of the excess iron surrounding cluster - centered elliptical galaxies correlates with their optical luminosity , just as we would expect from the integration above .",
    "furthermore , most of the gas - phase iron in the central iron peaks of clusters and groups is observed to have an snia abundance signature within about 100 kpc of the central elliptical galaxy ( de grandi & molendi 2001 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the extended regions of iron enrichment is that the iron was created in sniae within the central e galaxy , @xmath42 kpc , but was subsequently distributed outward by merging events into the much larger region where it is observed today .",
    "such mixing due to gas - phase mergers would need to be accompanied by an increased entropy if the iron - rich gas is to remain at a larger radius .",
    "if a merger radially mixes the gas without strong heating , after a dynamical time the gas will return to its original radius in the entropy structure and the original metallicity gradient will be restored .",
    "however , we expect that most of the shock energy dissipated ( and entropy created ) in mergers occurs closer to the virial radius which is very much larger than the @xmath43 kpc region enriched in iron .",
    "central increases in gas - phase metallicity are only observed in the most relaxed groups and clusters  they are clearly an indication of an old system . if mixing due to mergers occurred long ago , not enough snia iron would have been available to account for current observations .    in our previous gasdynamical studies including iron enrichment ( reviewed in mathews & brighenti 2003 ) , we found that the radial distribution of gas - phase iron from both type ii and early - time type ia supernovae can extend well beyond the optical radius @xmath44 of the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "this spatial spreading of the iron can result from early galactic winds if the central elliptical formed monolithically , or from sniae in stars in the central elliptical located well beyond @xmath44 where both the stellar and gas densities are low .",
    "nevertheless , these models can not spread the iron to radii as large as @xmath1 kpc where it is typically observed .    in a recent paper ( buote , brighenti & mathews 2004 ) we have shown that very little of the gas - phase iron in the ngc 5044 group has been supplied by outflows from the large number of low luminosity group member galaxies .",
    "the radial distribution of stellar mass in these non - central group galaxies is approximately constant within the @xmath1 kpc region where the gas iron enrichment has a strong gradient .",
    "it is clear from our arguments in that paper that the mass of iron in the central peak within @xmath45 kpc can not be ascribed to starburst outflows or winds associated with other members of the ngc 5044 group .",
    "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that a very large fraction of the iron in @xmath43 kpc was produced by type ia supernovae associated with stars that are currently within the large central elliptical , but where were these stars when the iron was produced ?",
    "perhaps the extended iron enrichment occurred as the stars within the central e galaxy were assembled .",
    "this seems unlikely , however , since the dynamical time for the assembly to occur , @xmath46 gyr , is very much less than the @xmath47 gyr time required to create @xmath48 @xmath13 by type ia supernovae .",
    "stars in galaxies undergoing dynamical friction spend most of their total lifetimes in the assembled elliptical galaxy , not in the assembly itself .    in this paper we consider an enrichment process in which iron from sniae in the central elliptical galaxy is heated by agn activity and conveyed by buoyant transport to @xmath43 kpc in the surrounding hot gas where it is currently observed .",
    "we show below that the agn energetics required to centrally heat the gas are reasonable and consistent with other properties of galaxy groups containing hot gas .",
    "furthermore , to store most or all of the iron from type ia supernovae over @xmath47 gyrs , it is essential that very little of the iron - rich gas cools .",
    "this is possible since the failure of cooling flows to cool is now widely accepted .",
    "while we have used the ngc 5044 group in our discussion , the same argument could be applied to many other similar galaxy groups and poor clusters with @xmath3 kev : rgh 80 ( xue , bhringer & matsushita 2004 ) , ngc 507 ( kim & fabbiano 2004 ) , mkw 4 ( osullivan et al . 2003 ) and ngc 1399 ( buote 2000a , b ) . in every case the hot gas surrounding the central elliptical has an extended region that can be fit better with more than one local temperature and is enriched to @xmath49 solar out to @xmath50 kpc by the products of type ia supernovae .",
    "the poor clusters m87 ( gastaldello & molendi 2002 ) and centaurus ( sanders & fabian 2002 ) also have extended multi - temperature , iron - rich regions surrounding the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric cooling flow that flows in to some small radius @xmath51 where it is heated .",
    "plumes and bubbles of heated gas rise buoyantly upstream in the cooling flow until their entropy matches that of the inflowing gas , provided there is no energy exchange between the bubbles and the ambient flow .",
    "the rising gas bubbles displace the inflowing gas and reduce the volume through which it flows .",
    "larger bubbles rise faster than smaller ones since they experience less drag per unit mass ( cf .",
    "equation 13 of mathews et al .",
    "the volume filling factor @xmath52 available to the inflowing gas is difficult to estimate because it depends on the unknown bubble size distribution .",
    "therefore we use observations of ngc 5044 and rgh 80 as guides to parameterize @xmath53 with the following expression @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 kpc is the maximum radius for which the x - ray spectrum shows two temperature components ( buote et al .",
    "this form for @xmath53 is also similar to the self - consistent filling factors we calculated for steady state circulation flows ( mathews et al .",
    "2003 ) . in reality",
    "@xmath52 may be a function of both radius and time , but we demonstrate below that the inflowing solutions are surprisingly insensitive to our choice for @xmath53 , and presumably also its time variation . the volume filled with inflowing gas in a shell of thickness @xmath57 is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the area available to the cooling inflow at radius @xmath60 .    in this first time - dependent calculation of mass recirculation in cooling flows , we treat the central galaxy as a source of heating and iron enrichment at radius @xmath61 kpc .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since the scale of the central galaxy is much less than the observed extent @xmath62 kpc of the region of snia - enriched gas surrounding it .",
    "the equation of continuity for the cooling inflow is @xmath63 + |{\\dot m}_h| \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the source term on the right represents the rate that mass is recirculated per unit volume by rapidly buoyant bubbles arriving from the galactic core . here",
    "@xmath64 is the rate that mass arrives at the heating radius @xmath51 and @xmath65 is the ( generally smaller ) rate that new mass is created in the central galaxy by stellar mass loss and type ia supernovae ( snia ) respectively .",
    "the specific stellar mass loss rate is @xmath66 where @xmath25 gyrs is the current age of the universe .",
    "the mass loss rate from snia is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the stellar mass to b - band light ratio and @xmath69 @xmath13 is the mass ejected in each snia event .",
    "the coefficient @xmath70 in the source term for the equation of continuity is the normalized probability that mass heated at radius @xmath51 is transported to a remote volume @xmath71 in the flow . in our study of steady state circulation flows we showed that the time for gas bubbles heated at @xmath51 to move out to their final radius was @xmath72 of the flow time back to @xmath51 .",
    "the time required for heated bubbles to reach their final radius is comparable to the dynamical time in the cluster potential which is short compared to the cooling ( or inflow ) time ; @xmath73 is a defining characteristic of so - called cooling flows .",
    "the normalization for the circulation probability is @xmath74 where @xmath51 and @xmath75 are the minimum and maximum radii that define the region of circulation .",
    "this suggests a simple probability @xmath76 that depends only on the radius , @xmath77 .",
    "for the mass redistribution we consider parameterized functions of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 @xmath80 is an adjustable scale factor and @xmath81 is either 1 or 2 but @xmath82 may have any positive value .",

    "the probability distribution has a maximum at @xmath86 .",
    "the density of iron requires a continuity equation of its own .",

    "the total density is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mean molecular weight for full ionization and @xmath92 allows for the mass of helium . since @xmath93 the density of element @xmath94 ( i.e. , iron ) is @xmath95 .",

    "2004 ) and we take @xmath100 as the solar abundance . each snia remnant is assumed to contain @xmath26 solar masses of iron .",
    "the production of iron by type ia supernovae is about ten times greater than that due to stellar mass loss .",
    "although the temperature and density in rising bubbles should both match those in the surrounding gas when their entropies become equal , the mass added by recirculated gas in some remote volume @xmath71 must cause the local gas density to increase with time .",
    "if the density increases in some region of the flow , the increased radiative cooling there increases the density further .",
    "eventually , the gas may cool catastrophically by runaway radiative losses .",
    "the dense , cooled gas then falls in the gravitational potential , and after time becomes supersonic , increasing @xmath108 enormously .    to avoid these undesirable consequences",
    ", it is necessary to heat the inflowing gas as it moves past the rising bubbles .",
    "this heating can be due to @xmath109 work done by the expanding bubbles , the power expended by the drag force on the rising bubbles , and thermal mixing of some bubble gas with the local inflow .",
    "the thermal evolution of the bubbles may not be purely adiabatic . in this discussion",
    "we wish to avoid a detailed discussion of these complicated bubble - flow interactions and simply assume that a power @xmath110 is transferred to the cooling flow where @xmath111 is a characteristic luminosity expended in heating gas at @xmath51 and @xmath112 is a dimensionless factor of order unity .",
    "the magnitude of this heating luminosity will be justified below .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that this distributed heating is transferred to the cooling flow with the same probability distribution @xmath70 as the mass recirculation .",
    "obviously , some very complicated bubble physics is subsumed with this assumption , some of which were discussed in our previous paper . however , by combining these detailed interactions into a single energy source term , we can explore new gas dynamical possibilities that must be verified by more detailed calculations in the future .",

    "the terms on the right hand side represent respectively compressive heating , cooling by radiative losses , addition of thermal energy density associated with the ( non - heating ) mass deposition and genuine heating provided by the mass deposition . when @xmath117 the recirculated mass is assumed not to heat or cool the gas ,",
    "so the specific thermal energy @xmath118 contributed by the recirculated gas is identical to that of the local gas .",
    "consequently , the energy density equation must have a source term analogous to that in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "this third term on the right side of equation ( 18 ) has little effect on the solutions .    while the spatial distribution @xmath70 of the bubble heating term @xmath119 need not be identical to that of the recirculated mass , it is the simplest assumption that involves the fewest number of additional parameters and seems appropriate for this initial study of time - dependent circulation .",
    "the power expended in heating the gas at @xmath51 is @xmath120 { 3 k t_h \\over 2 \\mu m_p } \\langle h \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the temperature of the inflowing gas at @xmath51 and @xmath122 is a dimensionless mean heating factor required to recirculate the gas .",
    "the mean heating factor @xmath122 can be estimated by examining how the incoming gas is heated at @xmath51 and assuming adiabatic bubble evolution .",
    "bubbles are formed at @xmath51 with temperature @xmath123 where @xmath121 is the cooling flow temperature at the heating radius .",
    "[ virialized gas lost from stars in the central galaxy is also assumed to have a pre - heating temperature @xmath124 ; in general @xmath108 is considerably larger than @xmath125 . ]",
    "the bubbles are always in pressure balance with the surrounding gas , @xmath126 and so @xmath127 as bubbles move out from @xmath51 , their entropy is assumed to be constant , @xmath128 some deviation from constant entropy is expected if the bubbles radiate or if they lose mechanical energy in heating the surrounding gas , so our adiabatic assumption is a limiting case . eliminating @xmath129 from the equations above gives an equation for the bubble density at @xmath130 @xmath131 and , if the entropy is conserved , @xmath132    adiabatically rising bubbles expand and cool . by examination of the last two equations above , as outflowing bubbles of constant specific entropy approach the radius in the flow where the flow entropy matches that of the bubbles , @xmath133 , the densities and temperatures also become equal , i.e. @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the specific thermal energy of gas adiabatically transported in this manner to distant regions of the flow is identical to that in the surrounding gas and no heating occurs in this idealized approximation .",
    "we shall see below , however , that the increase in gas mass in the flow due to the deposition of outflowing gas actually results in a higher gas density , which is further increased by ( non - adiabatic ) radiative cooling .",

    "we showed that this momentum exchange is not particularly important for a wide range of bubble sizes .",
    "in addition we discussed in detail the contribution of the heated gas to the overall x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray emission from rising bubbles is small but observable , but emission from the hottest gas that ends up at the largest radii , is necessarily the lowest because of its low density . in the standard single - temperature interpretation of the x - ray emission from ngc 5044 and other similar flows ,",
    "the observed temperature is dominated by that of the dense inflowing gas , as we have shown in our previous paper on circulation flows ( mathews et al .",
    "finally , in this earlier paper we discussed in detail the various heating processes by which the rising bubbles can share energy with the ambient gas .",
    "we will see below that energy exchange between gas flowing in opposite directions is critical to the success of time - dependent circulation flows .",
    "gas dynamical solutions are found by solving equations ( 5 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) in spherical symmetry using a 1d zeus - like eulerian code ( stone & norman 1992 ) .",
    "we employ a computational grid of 100 logarithmically increasing zones between @xmath61 kpc and @xmath149 kpc in which the first zone is 215 pc in width .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath51 and the boundary at @xmath75 is fixed and reflecting since it is far beyond the cooling radius ( @xmath150 kpc ) where the radial flow is negligible .",
    "our first objective is to establish a dynamically relaxed cooling flow without mass recirculation , i.e. @xmath151 .",
    "this flow can serve as a smooth starting point for flows with circulation .",
    "solutions with @xmath151 also allow us to explore the effect that various filling factors @xmath53 have on the flow .",
    "the initial conditions for these pure cooling ( and non - circulating ) flows are the temperature and density profiles observed in ngc 5044 ( buote et al .",
    "the gas is initially at rest .",
    "these initial profiles are shown with dotted lines in figure 2 .",
    "three cooling flows are calculated for @xmath152 years between @xmath51 and @xmath75 for three fixed filling factors having @xmath153 , 0.5 and 1 , but all with @xmath56 kpc ( see equation 3 ) .",
    "after @xmath154 gyrs the computed gas density and temperature profiles , shown with solid lines in figure 2 , remain in reasonably good agreement with the profiles observed in ngc 5044 today , shown with dotted lines . while this is reassuring",
    ", it has no particular significance since there is no reason to expect that the profiles observed today should persist over such a long time , particularly since our flows include no heating .",
    "some modest heating does seem to be required in @xmath43 kpc where the computed temperature profiles are @xmath155 kev below those observed .",
    "gas beyond about 100 kpc does not change appreciably during the entire calculation although information moves at the sound speed from @xmath51 to @xmath75 in only 0.95 gyr . both observed and computed temperature profiles @xmath156 exhibit maxima well beyond the optical half - light radius , @xmath157 kpc , of the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "this thermal feature , which is observed in the hot gas on all scales from galaxies to rich clusters , is a characteristic signature of cooling by radiative losses .",
    "the overall approximate agreement of our simple cooling flows with ngc 5044 indicates that , to a first approximation , the x - ray emission from this group is dominated by inflowing gas that resembles a conventional cooling flow .",
    "the observed entropy , pressure and density profiles plotted in figure 2 with dotted lines have been interpreted assuming that the filling factor is unity .",
    "however , the computed solid line curves in figure 2 are the actual variables in the gas flowing for each assumed @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , to compare the computed flows ( solid lines ) in figure 2 with observations , the computed density profiles would need to be adjusted downward by @xmath158 and the entropy upward by @xmath159 .",
    "both these adjustments tend to bring the solid curves into better agreement with the observations at small radii .",
    "the most useful result in figure 2 is the insensitivity of the inflowing gas density and temperature profiles to large variations in the filling factor @xmath53 . to the accuracy that we require for our goals here , the computed gas profiles are identical for all three @xmath53",
    ". the similarity of flows with different filling factors is particularly advantageous because of the difficulty in determining the filling factor either from first principles or from very detailed numerical calculations ; fortunately @xmath53 can be found from observations . in our study of",
    "steady state circulation flows we were able to determine the filling factor for the return flow in a self - consistent manner only if all bubbles were assumed to have the same mass ( mathews et al .",
    "however , in view of the insensitivity to @xmath53 , none of the conclusions that we reach below depends strongly on the particular filling factor @xmath53 chosen or its possible variation with time , provided it does not deviate radically from the three @xmath53 illustrated in figure 2 that bracket the known observations of galaxy groups .",
    "therefore , in the remaining flows discussed below we adopt a fixed filling factor with parameters @xmath160 and @xmath56 kpc .",
    "as discussed earlier , we consider the possibility that most or all of the gas that flows into the central galaxy , as well as gas expelled from evolving stars , is heated and buoyantly transported , with its iron , into a large volume of the surrounding hot gas .",
    "heating near @xmath51 is assumed to be continuous and isotropic , creating bubbles that flow out in every direction . in this initial study of",
    "time - dependent circulation flows we exploit the defining property of cooling flows that the dynamical time is much less than the cooling time .",
    "indeed , as we showed in mathews et al . ( 2003 ) , the dynamical time for heated gas to rise buoyantly is much less than the radiative cooling time that governs the incoming flow .    in this section",
    "we describe circulation flows in which bubbles of gas heated near radius @xmath61 kpc float outward without heating the incoming flow . in view of the variety of complicated ways that rising bubbles can heat the inflowing gas ,",
    "it is useful to consider flows with no heating as a useful intermediate step toward more realistic flows .",
    "these idealized bubbles rise adiabatically to their final radius and deposit gas into the cooling flow at a radius where the entropy and specific thermal energy of the bubble are identical to those in the ambient flow .",
    "non - heated circulation flows can be studied by allowing recirculation of mass , @xmath161 , but not heat energy , i.e. @xmath112 is set to zero in equation ( 18 ) so there is no distributed energy source . each flow",
    "( and those discussed subsequently ) begins at cosmic time @xmath162 gyrs , corresponding to a redshift of 2.5 , with initial conditions taken from the fully - relaxed @xmath163 solution in figure 2 .",
    "the spatial evolution of the iron abundance @xmath164 , is also followed .",
    "we find that such non - heated flows cool catastrophically and deviate strongly from the observations .",
    "such cooling is not desired in our solutions since we wish to retain all of the snia iron in the hot gas as the observations suggest .",
    "if the mass circulation pattern @xmath70 is too concentrated near some radius @xmath165 , the increased gas density there leads to rapid radiative losses and eventual cooling .",
    "such a case is illustrated in figure 3 in which the recirculation and heating parameters for @xmath70 are ( @xmath166 ) = ( 2,18,10,0 ) . for this @xmath70",
    "the recirculated mass is deposited in an annulus @xmath47 kpc wide located at @xmath167 kpc .",
    "as it grows in mass , this shell cools and settles inward in the gravitational potential . at time 3.6 gyrs , as shown in figure 3 , some gas has cooled to @xmath168 k and the flow does not subsequently recover from this state .",
    "therefore , the commonly held notion that bubbles of heated gas rise adiabatically to some radius where their entropy @xmath169 matches that of the local cooling flow @xmath170 can not be sustained because the local entropy of the flow is reduced as recirculated mass is introduced .",
    "even if the mass in an annular shell increases at constant temperature , the gas density increases and local radiative losses are stimulated ; both processes decrease the local gas entropy .",
    "this is an important consideration that leads to the failure of all models described in this section .",
    "our discussion in  3 relating the heating factor @xmath140 to a unique radius @xmath60 must necessarily be viewed as a semi - quantitative idealization .",
    "the iron abundance in figure 3 is distributed within a region between the current location of the dense shell and the somewhat larger radius @xmath165 at which @xmath70 has a maximum .",
    "a similar localized cooling can develop if the mass recirculation is more evenly distributed just between @xmath51 and some radius @xmath171 less than the cooling radius . if the mass deposition decreases sharply at @xmath171 , the cooling inflow from @xmath172 can be locally decelerated and compressed near @xmath171 .",
    "this sort of flow , not illustrated here , can result in radiative cooling to low temperatures in a gaseous shell .",
    "such compressive cooling was anticipated in our earlier work on steady circulation flows and resembles the cooling galactic drips discussed by mathews ( 1997 ) .",
    "circulation flows without distributed heating ( @xmath117 ) also fail even if the mass redistribution @xmath70 is very broad .",
    "such a flow with parameters ( @xmath166 ) = ( 1,1.5,30,0 ) is illustrated in figure 4 at time 8.0 gyrs when the flow has cooled catastrophically near @xmath61 kpc . in this flow",
    "the entropy @xmath173 out to @xmath174 kpc has been dramatically reduced because of radiative losses associated with the increased density . as the density increases",
    ", the gas pressure gradient must become more negative to balance the gravitational potential , causing the gas pressure at small radii to increase .",
    "the gas pressure actually develops a maximum just beyond @xmath51 within which gas is forced inward .",
    "the entire gas flow within @xmath174 kpc is approaching that of freefall and the mass flux at @xmath51 , @xmath108 , has become very large .",
    "the high inflow velocity and the rapid recirculation of gas from @xmath51 to larger radii cause the iron abundance to be low and flat - topped as seen in figure 4 .",
    "fortunately , catastrophic cooling is easily eliminated by introducing a distributed heating term in the energy equation , @xmath175 .",
    "for simplicity , we consider heating that is distributed over the flow with the same normalized probability distribution @xmath70 that describes the mass circulation .",
    "even with this constraint many circulation flow models are in satisfactory agreement with observation .",
    "the time - dependent flows we describe here are often in a quasi - steady state , stable over long periods of time , so it is interesting to consider how the interbubble gas is heated by counter - streaming bubbles in the steady state limit . as a matter of principle , an ensemble of outflowing and expanding bubbles does not heat the surrounding gas by performing @xmath6 work provided conditions are approximately steady state ( mathews et al . 2003 ) . certainly a single bubble that suddenly appears and rises into an atmosphere of hot gas displaces its volume in the ambient gas at every radius and moves some ambient gas higher in the gravitational potential",
    ". in this case",
    "@xmath6 work is done as the cloud expands and moves outward .",
    "however , a single buoyant cloud is not a steady state phenomenon , it is inherently time - dependent .",
    "an approximate steady state is possible only if many clouds are flowing through each shell of volume @xmath176 at any time . in this case",
    "the volume filled with rising bubbles @xmath177 is nearly constant ; as bubbles exit from the surface at @xmath178 , new ones appear at @xmath60 , approximately conserving the number and total volume of bubbles .",
    "individual bubbles expand adiabatically as they move from @xmath60 to @xmath179 and their internal energy decreases accordingly .",
    "however , this expansion does not continuously heat the interbubble gas since , in the strict steady state sense , this work was already done by similar bubbles at an infinite time in the past . since the volume of the interbubble gas does not change in steady flow , @xmath180 and the surrounding gas experiences no continuous @xmath181 heating . instead ,",
    "as bubbles move through @xmath71 the ambient cooling flow gas is subsonically rearranged transversely along equipotential surfaces , conserving its total volume .",
    "however , some work is done against viscous forces during this rearrangement . as a result ,",
    "each bubble experiences a drag force as it moves upstream through the interbubble gas .",
    "work done against viscous drag is a continuous source of spatially distributed heating in the surrounding gas .",
    "figure 5 illustrates two heated circulation flows that evolved without catastrophic radiative cooling from 2.65 gyrs to 13.7 gyrs and which are in reasonable agreement with the observed properties of ngc 5044 and other similar x - ray luminous groups . the final temperature and iron abundance profiles of a flow described with circulation parameters ( @xmath166 )",
    "= ( 1,1.5,45,1.6 ) are shown as light solid and dashed lines in figure 5 .",
    "the parameters for this flow were chosen to fit the observed temperature profile of ngc 5044 , but the iron abundance does not exceed about 0.7 solar , somewhat lower than that observed in this group ( buote et al .",
    "the iron abundance observed in ngc 5044 , which rises to @xmath182 solar at @xmath183 kc , is better fit with the circulation flow ( @xmath166 ) = ( 1,1.1,41,1.9 ) which is shown with heavy solid and dashed lines in figure 5 . because of the slightly larger heating @xmath184 in this flow , the inflow velocities are lower as the gas approaches @xmath51 and the iron abundance there is correspondingly larger . for both flows in figure 5 the total mass of iron within 100 kpc is about @xmath185 @xmath13 since we use the same snia rate as in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    evidently , if we relaxed our constraint that the recirculation distributions @xmath70 of mass and heat energy are identical and allowed them to vary with time , it would be possible to match both the abundance and gas temperature profiles for any observed group .",
    "the density , pressure , flow velocity and entropy profiles for the two flows shown in figure 5 are acceptable fits to the ngc 5044 observations .",
    "indeed , we find similar flows with a range of parameters ( @xmath166 ) , indicating that our results are robust .",
    "it is particularly significant that the computed temperature profiles @xmath156 in figure 5 have maxima and positive gradients @xmath186 at small @xmath60 . in our previous paper on circulation flows ( mathews et al .",
    "2003 ) we showed that the x - ray emission from hotter buoyant clouds of much lower density does not significantly alter the single phase temperature profile established by the denser inflowing gas .",
    "however , in the diffusely heated 1d and 2d cooling flows that we previously solved with numerical hydrocodes , we invariably found monotonically decreasing temperatures @xmath187 in the centrally heated region ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 2002 ) . in those calculations we heated all the gas throughout a volume near the center of the flow , including gas at all densities , and",
    "our specific objective was not to create or follow bubbles in the heated region .",
    "some larger buoyant bubbles flowed out from the heated region but they were not resolved in part because of spurious numerical diffusion .",
    "we avoid numerical diffusion here by assigning a fraction @xmath188 of the volume to the buoyantly outflowing heated gas .",
    "but the outwardly increasing temperature near the center in figure 5 is made possible only by the combined influence of the redistribution of heated mass and the cooling inflow .",
    "the profiles shown in figure 5 are not momentary transients that happen to be similar to the observations at time @xmath25 gyrs .",
    "while these flows are fully time - dependent , the gas density and temperature profiles remain highly stable during the last @xmath189 gyrs of the calculations .",
    "these flows are therefore quasi - steady and the main secular change is the slowly increasing iron abundance @xmath190 . finally , we emphasize that the circulation of mass that we describe here can not be viewed as normal convection , in which the entropy profile is flat , the temperature fluctuations are small , and the temperature gradient is negative .",
    "figure 6 shows the time variation of several global parameters for the two circulation flows illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "the mass flow rate @xmath191 at @xmath51 , the stellar mass loss rate @xmath192 and the approximate power expended in heating the gas at @xmath51 , @xmath111 , in units of @xmath193 erg s@xmath194 all slowly decrease with time .",
    "the current heating luminosity , @xmath195 erg s@xmath194 , is comparable to the x - ray luminosity of ngc 5044 , @xmath196 erg s@xmath194 , and this is expected in order to maintain the flow without radiative cooling to low temperatures .",
    "this level of heating @xmath110 corresponds to a rather low level agn , which is consistent with other observations of ngc 5044 .    in mathews",
    "et al . ( 2003 ) we showed that the heating of the cooling inflow by bubbles due to work done against drag forces and @xmath109 expansion ( if applicable ) are comparable .",
    "we now estimate the collective heating by bubbles in ngc 5044 due to drag interactions . assuming that the bubble velocity @xmath197 is much greater than that of the cooling inflow , the terminal velocity is @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the dimensionless drag coefficient and @xmath200 .",

    "the heating is continuous , but it may be possible to create similar circulation flows with intermittent heating near the center .",
    "it is likely , however , that the intermittency if it exists has a rather short period or duty cycle .",
    "the dynamical outflow time for bubbles of size @xmath201 at radius @xmath60 is @xmath208 . for bubbles of radius @xmath209 , at @xmath210 kpc ,",
    "@xmath211 km s@xmath194 and the bubble rise time @xmath212 years is rather short . if gas is heated periodically , the period would have to be less than this and may in fact be very much less .",
    "hot bubbles appear in the chandra image of ngc 5044 well within 10 kpc from the center , and the x - ray image of ngc 5044 is similar to those of other elliptical galaxies with comparable @xmath213 .",
    "if mass circulation is a common feature of all flows of this type , the implication is that there are no truly quiescent supermassive black holes .",
    "finally , we note that the heating due to type ia supernovae is small compared to @xmath111 .",
    "for example , at time @xmath214 the total snia heating luminosity is @xmath215 ergs s@xmath194 where @xmath216 ergs is released with each supernova . evaluating at @xmath217",
    ", we find @xmath218 erg s@xmath194 which is very much less than @xmath110 . for simplicity we have ignored supernova heating in equation ( 18 ) .",
    "one of the strangest features occasionally observed in cooling flows is a central minimum in the iron abundance ( johnstone , et al 2002 ; sanders & fabian 2002 ; schmidt , fabian & sanders 2002 ; blanton , sarazin & mcnamara 2003 ; dupke & white 2003 ) .",
    "when present , these minima typically lie within the central @xmath219 kpc of the flows , i.e. where conditions are dominated by the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "such minima  or a central flattening in @xmath190 which is even more common  would not be expected in conventional cooling flows since the local frequency of iron - producing type ia supernovae should increase with the stellar density toward the very center of the flow .",
    "( the stellar density is more centrally peaked than the gas density . )",
    "efforts to understand the central dips in the iron abundance in terms of differential cooling of abundance inhomogeneities have been discussed by morris & fabian ( 2003 ) .    in the",
    "circulation flows described here it is possible to produce small central iron abundance minima if the redistribution probability @xmath70 varies with time .",
    "for example , a small central dip in the iron abundance results if the iron ( and mass ) deposition @xmath70 is concentrated near @xmath220 kpc , just preceding the flow time for gas in this region to return to @xmath51 by the current time @xmath221 gyrs .",
    "central regions with very low iron abundance are difficult to form in circulation flows because ( 1 ) the cooling inflow necessary to explain the observed gas temperature profile continuously recirculates iron - enriched gas within @xmath2 kpc and , since most of the snia iron is produced at early times , ( 2 ) relatively little iron is available during the last cooling inflow time to create a strong reversal in the iron abundance profile .",
    "for these same reasons , central iron deficiencies are not easy to produce by allowing the iron mass and energy redistribution probabilities @xmath70 to differ . nevertheless , because of the continuous radial recirculation it is quite natural for the central gas iron abundance in circulation flows to become rather constant within @xmath222 kpc where the snia - producing stars are very strongly peaked .",
    "similar flat or slowly varying iron abundance cores are commonly observed in many groups and clusters .",
    "although the heated flows we describe here are generally successful , much additional work will be necessary before they can be fully accepted .",
    "we have not identified the physical mechanism(s ) that heat the gas near the center , but they are likely to be associated with the central black hole .",
    "these heating processes may be related to the common difficulty in observing hot gas in close proximity to the central black hole , constraining the accretion rate to less than 10 percent of the bondi rate ( loewenstein et al .",
    "if gas is heated near the black hole , less accretion is expected .",
    "it is likely that cosmic rays and magnetic fields are relevant since the cores of almost all massive elliptical galaxies are sites of low luminosity nonthermal radio emission ( e. g. sadler et al .",
    "powerful radio jets are typically found in rich clusters , not in ( more numerous ) small groups that contain central ellipticals of comparable optical luminosity .",
    "jets that deposit energy asymmetrically and to very large radii are an unlikely heating source for groups like ngc 5044 and rgh 80 . by contrast , the heating required in our circulation flows is isotropic and requires a modest , approximately continuous agn power .    in our discussion of steady state circulation flows ( mathews et al .",
    "2003 ) , we describe limits on the size and mass of bubbles if heating occurs at some radius @xmath51 in the flow . provided they remain coherent , larger bubbles can move to larger radii , but the size of new bubbles can not exceed the radius @xmath51 where they are formed and this in turn limits the global rate that mass can be buoyantly transported outward .",
    "we discussed these difficulties in the context of steady state circulation and they did not critically impair the circulation model . in this first paper on time - dependent circulation",
    "we have not discussed again all these important considerations .",
    "the insensitivity of circulation flows to the filling factor also lessens the urgency for a fully self - consistent model for the rising bubbles , even if that were possible .",
    "nevertheless , as we computed these circulation flows , our concept of the heating radius @xmath51 became more flexible .",
    "we consider @xmath51 to be only a representative radius where the gas is heated .",
    "larger ( smaller ) clouds may be heated and formed at larger ( smaller ) radii . in reality",
    "the heating probably occurs throughout a volume that may vary with time .",
    "a critical measure of the success of circulation flows is the apparent rise in the gas temperature toward a maximum well outside the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "this @xmath156 is possible only if the emission from the high density cooling inflow dominates the observed temperature profile in the inner flow , even when the mass flux carried by the rising bubbles transports nearly the same mass outward .",
    "we showed that this is indeed the case for steady state circulation flows ( mathews et al .",
    "2003 ) . to see why this is also true for time - dependent circulations",
    ", we estimate the ratio of the bubble to cooling flow bolometric x - ray emissivities at @xmath223 at time @xmath214 , @xmath224 the bubble density at @xmath51 can be estimated from the steady state equation for mass conservation , @xmath225 } { 1 \\over u_{bh}}\\ ] ] where @xmath226 is the typical velocity of rising bubbles near @xmath51 . using the flow parameters for the ( @xmath166 ) = ( 1,1.5,30,2.0 ) flow at time @xmath217 , we find @xmath227 gm @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the bubble velocity in units of 100 km s@xmath194 .",
    "the bubble temperature @xmath230 k follows from pressure equilibrium . with these values",
    "we find @xmath231 if @xmath232 , a typical initial bubble velocity in the steady flows of mathews et al .",
    "therefore , emission from the cooling inflow dominates the observed @xmath156 and the bolometric x - ray emission near the center of this flow .",
    "x - ray spectral features from heated gas may be emitted mostly by somewhat denser gas at intermediate temperatures , @xmath233 .",
    "there are two stages of heating in our circulation flows . near the center @xmath234",
    "we assume a strong and concentrated heating by an agn that rather sharply raises the entropy , creating buoyant bubbles of hot gas .",
    "this is regarded as the primary heating mechanism .",
    "a second heating process occurs when the rising bubbles share some of this thermal energy with the inflowing gas over a large region of the flow . without this distributed heating the entropy profile in the gas fails to match the observations ( as in figure 4 ) .",
    "distributed heating occurs because of bubble - flow drag or because some of the outflowing gas thermally merges with the incoming flow before it reaches the radius where the initial entropy of the bubble equals that of the ambient flow .",
    "this distributed heating helps determine the location of the temperature maximum observed in the flow . finally , it is not surprising that the central heating exceeds @xmath111 by some factor @xmath235 because ( 1 ) the mean heating factor @xmath122 is underestimated if some of the bubble energy is prematurely transferred to the inflowing gas , ( 2 ) some of the bubble energy is lost by radiation and this is necessary to explain the superiority of two - temperature fits to the x - ray spectra , and ( 3 ) the kinetic energy acquired by the bubbles is extracted from the galaxy - group potential and is independent of @xmath111 .",
    "x - ray observations of the perseus cluster show buoyant cavities that have moved through distances that are 10 - 15 times larger than that of the cavity diameters ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "the coherence of these large bubbles is remarkable , and they appear to be transporting mass and heated gas to large radii in the flow . since small buoyant regions experience more drag",
    "as they move upstream through the cooling flow , their rate of progress may not be sufficient to convey the mass and energy that we require in the models described here .",
    "clearly , observational and computational studies of the physical coherence of heated regions will be necessary to fully validate circulation flows .",
    "the dynamical coherence of heated bubbles may result from internal magnetic fields that are force free .",
    "it is possible that some gas cools . for ngc 5044 , @xmath61 kpc , taken literally ,",
    "is about @xmath236 so we expect @xmath21 @xmath13 yr@xmath194 from stellar mass loss within @xmath51 .",
    "even if this gas cools radiatively in the usual manner , such a small cooling rate would not have been detected in our xmm observations ( buote et al .",
    "however , cooling in this core region is likely to be accelerated by electron - dust grain cooling and emit x - rays at a much reduced level ( mathews & brighenti 2003 ) .",
    "central ( dust - enhanced ) cooling may consume @xmath237 percent of the iron produced by sniae .",
    "in this paper we describe a new model for the dynamical evolution of hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies in which gas flows in both radial directions simultaneously .",
    "the incoming gas resembles a traditional cooling flow and dominates the x - ray emission .",
    "the outgoing gas consists of an ensemble of heated buoyant bubbles that rise to distant regions where they merge with the inflowing gas .",
    "we have not calculated the dynamics of the rising bubbles of heated gas in detail , and this must be an objective for the future . instead , we constructed a schematic time - dependent model guided in part by observations and by the detailed bubble - flow interactions described in our previous study of steady state circulation flows ( mathews et al .",
    "it is noteworthy and fortunate that the density and temperature profiles of the cooling , inflowing gas are not sensitive to the filling factor @xmath53 , which is easier to determine reliably from the observations than from dynamical models for the bubbles .",
    "this insensitivity may explain the approximate similarity of @xmath156 and @xmath238 profiles in clusters of all sizes .",
    "we have shown here that the steady state circulation flows we proposed earlier ( mathews et al .",
    "2003 ) can be generalized to include time variation .",
    "an essential feature of successful circulation flows is that both mass and energy must be distributed from the center throughout a large volume of the flow within the cooling radius .",
    "the outward increase in gas temperature near the center of the flow , a characteristic feature of most galaxy clusters , results largely from a conventional cooling inflow , modified somewhat by additional energy received from locally outflowing bubbles . after evolving for many gyrs , circulation flows are in accord with the important observation that most or all of the iron produced by type ia supernovae in the central elliptical galaxy has been stored in a region typically extending to @xmath1 kpc . from the perspective of the circulation flow hypothesis , a record of the enrichment - heating history of groups is retained in currently observed iron and temperature profiles of the hot gas and it may be possible to retrieve this information by comparison with more accurate circulation flows .",
    "the central peak in the radial iron distribution within @xmath0 kpc is very sensitive to the ( negative ) cooling inflow velocity at small radii .",
    "if this velocity is high , the iron abundance remains low and flat - topped .",
    "iron abundance profiles that peak sharply toward the center , such as that observed in ngc 5044 , can occur only if the flow velocity is reduced to a very low level by ( recent ) large heating near the center .",
    "we have shown that the central iron peak is more pronounced when the mass redistribution and heating are more strongly peaked at smaller radii .",
    "concentrated peaks in the iron abundance within @xmath1 kpc are also typically observed in many rich clusters : sersic 159 - 03 ( kaastra et al 2001 ) , cygnus a ( smith et al . 2002 ) , abell 1795 ( ettori et al . 2002 ) and abell 2029 ( lewis , stocke & buote 2002 ) .",
    "we speculate that these regions are also mostly enriched by the circulation of iron from type ia supernovae in the central galaxies and there is some observational support for this ( e.g. ettori et al . 2002 ) .",
    "if so , this may indicate a characteristic heating luminosity @xmath239 ergs s@xmath194 for all clusters .",
    "however , if there is an upper limit on the heating luminosity @xmath111 , perhaps set by the physical conditions near the central black hole , it is possible that the mass inflow rate @xmath240 in rich clusters is too large for the inflowing gas to be heated in the way we describe here .",
    "this may give rise to an additional more violent energy releases in the form of powerful radio jets which are rare in galaxy groups that have more modest mass cooling rates @xmath240 .",
    "we believe the circulation flows described here are the first gasdynamic , long - term evolutionary models that are in good agreement with all essential features of the hot gas : the gas temperature maximum at several @xmath44 , the approximately linear rise of entropy with radius , the dominance of snia products in the x - ray spectra , the total iron mass within 100 kpc and its radial distribution .",
    "the relative constancy of these observed profiles during many gyrs of our calculated flows is consistent with the similarity of the observed x - ray properties among galaxy groups and clusters .",
