    "entangled systems are ubiquitous in quantum information science , playing key roles in teleportation  @xcite , quantum repeaters  @xcite , dense coding  @xcite , entanglement swapping  @xcite , and fault tolerant quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "typical barriers to efficiently realizing these applications are twofold  first , the reliable generation of entangled pairs in a particular bell state , and second , complete bell - state measurement between two particles @xcite .",
    "entangled pair creation can be achieved via numerous methods ; for example , with photons it is possible through the non - linear interactions involved in spontaneous parametric downconversion @xcite .",
    "however , a complete , deterministic bell - state measurement is impossible within the broad class of apparatus obeying linear evolution and local measurement ( lelm )  @xcite .",
    "much focus is placed on these devices nonetheless , due to their ease of implementation . the inability to perform a complete",
    ", deterministic bell - state measurement with lelm has limited the unconditional fidelity achieved in numerous experimental settings @xcite",
    ". a deeper understanding of the exact bounds placed on bell - state distinguishability by lelm devices thus has implications for quantum communication protocols and other applications in quantum information science .",
    "recent experimental developments have opened the arena of entanglement between two particles in multiple degrees of freedom , a circumstance known as hyper - entanglement @xcite .",
    "existing bounds on nonlocal state distinguishability have involved systems entangled in two or fewer two - state variables @xcite , or in one three - state or @xmath0-state variable @xcite , yet experiments to date have achieved entanglement in up to three variables  @xcite . thus there is considerable motivation for more general theoretical bounds , for instance to establish channel capacities for superdense coding . in this paper , we consider the general case of two particles entangled in @xmath0 two - state variables .",
    "our analysis offers an @xmath0-variable distinguishability limit based on a simple understanding of the restrictions imposed by lelm ; we further describe a straightforward apparatus which will always achieve maximum distinguishability between hyper - entangled bell states .",
    "an apparatus constrained by `` linear evolution '' acts on each input particle independently of the other , so it can be represented as a unitary transformation over the space of single - particle input states .",
    "consequently , the single - particle output modes of the device are linear combinations of the single - particle input modes .",
    "`` local projective measurement '' means the detection event projects the system into a product state of two single - particle output modes .",
    "we consider measurement in a fock state basis of output modes , corresponding to annihilation of particles in the two detectors which register clicks .",
    "the system of interest consists of two particles whose states are described by @xmath0 two - state variables , each of which is represented in the basis @xmath3 .",
    "some examples include the following : for photonic systems , the linear polarization states @xmath4 , the subset @xmath5 of orbital angular momentum states , or time bins @xmath6 ; for atomic systems , two ground or metastable electronic states @xmath7 ; for electronic spin qubits , the states @xmath8 ; and many more two - state quantum systems .",
    "the two particles enter the lelm apparatus via separate spatial channels , designated _",
    "l _ and _ r _ , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "each single - particle input undergoes unitary evolution to the set of orthogonal output modes .",
    "each detector is capable of resolving number states in its associated mode , so two particles in a single detector can be reliably detected .",
    "a complete single - particle input is specified by particular values for all @xmath0 variables as well as the spatial channel .",
    "it has been shown that , for projective measurements with linear evolution , distinguishability between signal states can not be improved by the use of auxiliary modes as long as the signal states are of definite particle number @xcite .",
    "thus we may restrict our discussion to a space of single - particle input modes with dimension @xmath9 , and a corresponding @xmath9-dimensional space of output modes .",
    "finally , a complete detection event consists of annihilating particles in two output modes ( possibly the same mode twice ) .",
    "a useful basis for the input states consists of kets @xmath10 , each representing a particle in one of the @xmath9 possible input modes : either the @xmath11 or @xmath12 eigenstate of each variable , and either the left or right input channel .",
    "we assign odd indices @xmath13 to _ l_-channel states and even indices to _",
    "r_-channel states , such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are identical to one another except for the choice of left vs. right input channel ; @xmath16 ranges from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the set of all binary strings of length @xmath0 . for example , for @xmath20 ( one variable ) , the input - state basis is : @xmath21 with the restriction that @xmath22 , since the input states of interest are limited to those with one particle in each of the left and right input channels . for indistinguishable particles 1 and 2 ,",
    "the version @xmath23 is understood instead .",
    "we can describe a click in detector @xmath24 as a projection of the input state onto the single - particle output mode @xmath25 .",
    "the relationship between input and output modes depends on the apparatus , but without loss of generality we can write @xmath26 where the lelm apparatus is represented by the unitary matrix @xmath27 .",
    "each output mode thus takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a superposition of left - channel input states and @xmath30 is a superposition of right - channel input states .",
    "a complete detection signature corresponds to a projection of the two - particle input state onto the tensor product state @xmath31 ; for indistinguishable particles , the version @xmath32 is understood instead .",
    "furthermore , if we constrain the inputs to include just one particle in the left channel and one particle in the right , we should consider the projection of @xmath31 onto the subspace of two - particle input states spanned by @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "we call this projection the detection signature , denoted @xmath35",
    ".    finally , we turn to a description of the bell states themselves , which form an entangled basis for the two - particle system . in a single variable ,",
    "the bell basis consists of four maximally - entangled states given by @xmath36 or rather the ( anti)symmetrized versions of eqs .",
    "[ equation : phibell ]  and  [ equation : psibell ] . to generalize this basis for hyper - entanglement in @xmath0 variables ,",
    "we simply take a tensor product between the bell states for each individual variable .",
    "thus , the hyper - bell states are @xmath37 ; for @xmath0 variables , these are @xmath2 mutually orthogonal entangled states .",
    "as discussed above , there are @xmath9 mutually orthogonal output modes , or @xmath9 detectors . each hyper - bell state , due to its maximal entanglement ,",
    "is capable of producing at least one click in any detector @xmath24 . to see this ,",
    "suppose that detector @xmath24 is never triggered by hyper - bell state @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 for all output modes @xmath40 , or equivalently , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bell state symmetrized or antisymmetrized under exchange of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "for example , the symmetrized version of the single - variable bell state @xmath43 is @xmath44    if eq .",
    "[ eq : todisprove ] holds , it follows that @xmath45 however , the left - hand side of the last expression is simply @xmath46 , where the trace is taken over the states of particle 1 .",
    "however , this quantity can not be zero since the reduced density matrix @xmath47 is a multiple of the identity on the space of particle  2 states , including both left- and right - channel states .",
    "( consider , for example , @xmath48 calculated using eq .",
    "[ eq : phiplussym ] . )",
    "thus our supposition fails : eq .",
    "[ eq : todisprove ] can not hold , and so every bell state can in fact trigger every detector .",
    "a single detector click can not discriminate between any of the bell states .",
    "an alternate demonstration of this key point proceeds as follows .",
    "if the initial two - particle state is an arbitrary bell state @xmath38 , the state following a single click in some detector is proportional to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the annihilation operator associated with that output mode .",
    "the statement that the bell state can cause the detector to click is equivalent to the statement that the norm of this post - click state is nonzero .",
    "thus we must consider the quantity @xmath51 .",
    "we can rewrite the expression in terms of the annihilation operators @xmath52 associated with the single - particle input modes @xmath10 : @xmath53 .",
    "( recall from sec .",
    "ii that @xmath13 odd or even denotes left- or right - channel modes , respectively .",
    "further , if we are considering the output mode associated with detector @xmath24 , then @xmath54 in the notation of eq .",
    "[ u - transform ] . )",
    "thus @xmath55    to further evaluate this expression , we write the bell state as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the vacuum state , @xmath58 can take values 0 or 1 , and @xmath59 is a permutation of @xmath60 , so each left - channel mode of index @xmath61 is uniquely paired in this bell state with a right - channel mode of index @xmath62 ( and vice versa ) . from this form",
    "it is easy to see that , for any @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are orthogonal to each other , so @xmath66 . the final sum in eq .",
    "[ eq : postnorm ] vanishes by this reasoning . in the remaining sum of eq .",
    "[ eq : postnorm ] , @xmath67 for any input mode @xmath13 and any bell state @xmath38 , and so the sum simply evaluates to @xmath68 .",
    "thus in the end we have @xmath69 , a nonzero value independent of the particular bell state and output mode .",
    "in particular , any output mode is compatible with all bell states : a single detector click does not discriminate between bell states .",
    "1em    because a single detector event provides no information about which hyper - bell state the particles occupy , distinguishability must come from identifying one of the @xmath9 orthogonal outcomes for the second detector event .",
    "the @xmath9 possibilities form a simple upper bound on distinguishable bell - state classes from lelm devices , obtainable also by considering the schmidt number of at most 2 for any detection signature @xcite .",
    "we will now show that the actual maximum is one less than the simple upper bound , namely , @xmath1 .",
    "this general result agrees with previous results for @xmath20 ( 3 out of 4 ) and @xmath70 ( 7 out of 16 ) @xcite .    for fermions , the amplitude to observe two clicks in detector @xmath24 must always be zero , since @xmath71 is inherently symmetric under particle exchange .",
    "thus for any detector @xmath24 , at most @xmath1 detection signatures @xmath35 are nonzero .",
    "since all the bell states are represented in these @xmath1 signatures , there are at most @xmath1 distinguishable classes of hyper - bell states for two fermions .    for bosons ,",
    "consider a single output mode @xmath25 as represented in eq .",
    "[ det - even - odd ] .",
    "if either coefficient @xmath72 or @xmath73 is zero , the detection signature @xmath74 is zero , and we have at most @xmath1 distinguishable classes of bell states .    if @xmath25 is a nontrivial superposition of left- and right - channel inputs as in eq .",
    "[ det - even - odd ] , then some linear combination of output modes must satisfy : @xmath75 the hypothetical detection signature @xmath76 is zero , giving @xmath77 .",
    "consider some @xmath78 such that @xmath79 ; any bell state represented in the detection signature @xmath35 must also be represented in at least one other detection signature @xmath80 .",
    "thus it is not possible to reliably distinguish between a class of bell states that can produce clicks in detectors @xmath81 and a class that can produce clicks in detectors @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the number of distinguishable bell - state classes must be less than the full number of detection signatures involving detector @xmath24 , and there can be at most @xmath1 distinguishable classes of hyper - bell states for two bosons .    if the left and right input channels are not brought together in the apparatus , _",
    "e.g. _ , for experimental convenience , each output mode @xmath25 of eq .",
    "[ det - even - odd ] is simply equal to @xmath29 or to @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath18 output modes are superpositions of the left - channel inputs , and the other @xmath18 output modes are superpositions of the right - channel inputs . for any detector @xmath24 , only @xmath18 detection signatures @xmath35 are nonzero . since all the bell states are represented in these @xmath18 signatures , there are at most @xmath18 distinguishable classes of bell states for this case .",
    "a best - case apparatus for separate _",
    "l _ and _ r _ measurement can be achieved by measuring the _ l_- and _ r_-channel inputs each in the @xmath83 basis .",
    "this is a projective measurement in the @xmath10 basis , so detection signatures are of the form @xmath84 .",
    "bell states represented in one detection signature must be tensor products of @xmath85 in variables where @xmath86 and @xmath87 share their eigenvalue , and @xmath88 in variables where they do not . specifying @xmath89 vs. @xmath90 in this way yields @xmath18 classes of @xmath18 bell states each .    a unitary transformation realizing the maximal bell - state classes for fermionic or bosonic inputs is given by ( @xmath91 to @xmath18 ) : @xmath92 this is a hadamard transform between the _",
    "l _ and _ r _ channels for each @xmath0-variable eigenstate @xmath86 .    for bosons with linear evolution governed by eq .",
    "[ eq : besttransform ] , a detection signature @xmath93 or @xmath94 identifies the two - particle input state @xmath95 .",
    "these detection signatures thus all identify the class of @xmath18 hyper - entangled bell states @xmath96 .",
    "detection signatures of the form @xmath97 or @xmath98 , however , are antisymmetric under particle exchange and do not occur . for fermions",
    "the roles are reversed ; detection signatures @xmath97 or @xmath98 identify the class of @xmath18 hyper - entangled bell states @xmath96 , while detection signatures @xmath93 or @xmath94 are",
    "symmetric and do not occur .",
    "any detection signature not of the forms already discussed will give @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "bell states represented in such a detection signature have a well - defined sequence of @xmath89 vs. @xmath90 in the @xmath0 variables .",
    "furthermore , the sign of the superposition in eq . [ smallclasses ] gives the symmetry of the overall state with respect to exchange of _ l _ and _ r _ ; the @xmath101 bell state is antisymmetric in this way while the others are all symmetric , so a @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) sign in eq .",
    "[ smallclasses ] restricts that detection signature to hyper - entangled bell states with @xmath101 in an even ( odd ) number of variables .",
    "thus each such detection signature identifies a class of @xmath104 bell states .",
    "there are @xmath105 classes of this type and one @xmath96 class , so exactly @xmath1 classes are reliably distinguished .",
    "an optimal apparatus for photons is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimaldet ] . a 50/50 beamsplitter performs ( up to overall phase shifts ) the _ l_/_r _ hadamard transform of eq .",
    "[ eq : besttransform ] ; the input modes are then separated according to the value of each variable , so detector clicks project into the @xmath83 basis .",
    "previous optimal distinguishability schemes for @xmath20 are of this form @xcite .    the schemes above can be varied by performing projective measurement in the diagonal @xmath106 basis rather than the @xmath107 basis for one or more variables .",
    "for example , for @xmath20 , an optimal unitary transformation can be written in the basis of eq .",
    "[ eq:1dinputbasis ] as @xmath108 for polarization - entangled photons , eq . [ equation : umatrix2 ] is realized by a 50/50 beamsplitter and polarizing beamsplitters at @xmath109 .    with two copies of a hyper - bell state , complete distinguishability",
    "can be achieved by measuring one copy in the apparatus of eq .",
    "[ eq : besttransform ] , and the second in a version where detectors project into the diagonal basis for all @xmath0 variables . @xmath43 and @xmath101 in each variable",
    "retain their forms in the diagonal basis , while the other bell states exchange forms , @xmath110 . states indistinguishable via the first apparatus share a common sequence of @xmath89 vs. @xmath90 in the @xmath0 variables , and differ by @xmath102 vs. @xmath103 in one or more variables .",
    "all these states will have distinct @xmath89 vs. @xmath90 sequences in the diagonal basis , so they will give distinct measurement outcomes in the second apparatus .",
    "in fact , the same principle gives two - copy complete distinguishability even by measuring l- and r - channel inputs separately in the @xmath83 basis for one copy and the @xmath111 basis for the second copy .",
    "other optimal schemes exist , such as those already known for @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we have shown that devices constrained by linear evolution and local measurement can not reliably distinguish more than @xmath1 bell states or bell - state classes for two particles entangled in @xmath0 degrees of freedom .",
    "this bound holds even for conditional measurements ; after a click in detector @xmath24 , no conditional evolution of the remaining state to output channels will avoid the limitations presented above .",
    "however , two copies of the hyper - bell state allow complete distinguishability . we have constructed unitary transformations of input states to output states which achieve the upper bound on distinguishability for one and two copies of the hyper - bell state .",
    "this work illustrates the potential and limitations for manipulation and measurement of entangled systems with inherently linear , unentangling devices .",
    "it relies on a very physical approach to consider cases in which previous @xmath112 methods are computationally unattractive ; checking the @xmath113 bound by previous methods involves searching for solutions to @xmath114 systems of 16 equations .",
    "our approach gives another way of understanding the @xmath112 bounds , and may provide a framework for further bounds , perhaps on lelm distinguishability of hyper - entangled states involving qutrit or higher - dimensional variables .",
