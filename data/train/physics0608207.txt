    "recently , it has been recognized that in many natural sequences the elements are not positioned randomly , but exhibit long - range correlations and fractal dynamics .",
    "prominent examples include noncoding dna sequences @xcite , human heartbeat @xcite , human brain electroencephalogram @xcite , teenagers births in texas @xcite , and financial time series @xcite .",
    "the common feature of all these diverse systems with long - range correlations is that scaling behavior decay by a power law , where a characteristic scale is absent , and the scaling behavior is usually rather robust and universal .",
    "the scaling behavior in complex systems is not only interesting in physical sense , but also provides an intrinsic description of the system , and highlights the system dynamical mechanism .",
    "several useful variance - based methods , such as the probability moment method @xcite and the fluctuation approach as well as the de - trended fluctuation approach @xcite , are proposed to detect the scale - invariance properties . however , these variance - based methods have two basic shortcomings .",
    "one is that the scale - invariance property can be detected but the value of the exponent can not be obtained accurately .",
    "the other is that for some processes , like the lvy flight , the variance tends to infinite and these methods are unavailable at all @xcite .",
    "although the infinite can not be reached due to the finite records of empirical data , clearly we will obtain misleading information about the dynamics under these conditions .",
    "the dynamics of human gait is relative to locomotor system s synthesizing inputs from the motor cortex , the basal ganglia and the cerebellum , as well as feedback from the vestibular , visual and proprioceptive sources .",
    "therefore , to investigate the scaling behavior of the stride interval fluctuations of human gait is very interesting with both the physical and physiological communities . by using some recently proposed approaches for nonlinear data",
    ", some scientists studied the statistical characters of the stride interval fluctuations of human gait @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite demonstrated that the stride interval time series exhibits long - range correlations , suggesting that the human gait displays a self - similar activity .",
    "subsequent studies , by west _",
    "et al _ and goldberger _",
    "et al _ @xcite , supported the above conclusion , and several dynamics models are established to mimic the human gait @xcite .",
    "furthermore , perc @xcite found that the human gait process possesses some typical properties like a deterministic chaotic system . in this paper , we apply the diffusion entropy ( de ) technique to accurately detect and obtain the scaling property of stride interval fluctuations of human gait on a fourier analysis .",
    "[ 0.8 ] a typical example about the stride interval fluctuation of human gait.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "to overcome the mentioned shortcomings in the variance - based methods , grigolini _",
    "_ @xcite designed the approach named diffusion entropy analysis ( dea ) . to keep our description as self - contained as possible , we briefly review the dea method .    consider a complex system containing a large amount of particles .",
    "the scale - invariance property in the diffusion process of this system can be described mathematically with the probability distribution function as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the displacements of the particles in the complex system and @xmath4 the scale@xmath5invariance exponent .",
    "the theoretical foundation of this property is the central limit theorem and the generalized central limit theorem @xcite . for @xmath6 ,",
    "the diffusion process is the standard diffusion and @xmath7 is the gaussian function . and @xmath8 indicates the deviation of the dynamical process from the normal stochastic one .",
    "for example , the case with @xmath9 corresponds to the diffusion process of lvy walk .    for a time series ,",
    "the delay - register vectors , denoted with @xmath10 , can be regarded as the trajectories of @xmath11 particles during the period of @xmath12 to @xmath13 . in this way",
    "we can map a time series to a diffusion process , called overlapping diffusion process here .",
    "an alternative solution is to separate the considered time series into many non - overlapping segments and regard these segments as the trajectories .    to make the data suitable for the illustration of scaling behavior at all scales , we propose a method based on the fourier transform to detrend the nonstationary trend in whole temporal domain",
    "first , transform the time series to fourier space and then , use the invert fourier transform to obtain the time series with cutoff coefficient .",
    "we consider the curtailed time series as the trend and subtract it from original series .",
    "then , the final time series is regarded as a steady series , whose overlapping diffusion process reads @xmath14 consequently , the shannon entropy can be defined as @xmath15dx.\\ ] ] a simple algebraic leads to @xmath16 where @xmath17dx , y=\\frac{x}{t^\\delta}.\\ ] ] the dea method has been used to analysis many time series in different research fields , such as the solar induced atmosphere temperature series @xcite , the intermittency time series in fluid turbulence @xcite , the spectra of complex networks @xcite , the output spike trains of neurons @xcite , the index of financial market @xcite , and so on .",
    "herein , we map a time series to a diffusive process and introduce the de technique to investigate the time series of stride interval fluctuations of human gait , which is obtained from healthy subjects who walked for 1 hour at their normal , slow and fast paces @xcite . the data contains the stride interval fluctuations of ten young healthy men , given an arbitrary i d @xmath18 .",
    "participants have no history of any neuromuscular , respiratory , or cardiovascular disorders and are taking no medication .",
    "mean age is 21.7 yr ( range @xmath19 yr ) .",
    "height is @xmath20 , and weight is @xmath21 .",
    "all the subjects provided informed written consent .",
    "subjects walked continuously on level ground around an obstacle free , long ( either 225 or 400 meters ) , approximately oval path and the stride interval is measured using ultra - thin , force sensitive switches taped inside one shoe .",
    "a typical example is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the stride interval significantly decreased and the velocity significantly increased with each chosen walking rate , as expected .",
    "the mean stride intervals of the three subjects are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 during the slow , normal , fast walking trials , respectively . and the mean velocities are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 during the slow , normal , and fast walking , respectively . the mean velocity increases by an average of @xmath28 from slow to fast walking . a wide range of walking rates",
    "are obtained , enable us to test for the effects of walking rate on the scaling behavior indicating the long - range correlations .",
    "the locomotor control system maintains the stride interval at an almost constant level throughout the 1 hour walking .",
    "nevertheless , the stride interval fluctuations is in a highly complex , seemingly random fashion . in order to truly uncover the scaling behavior of the stride interval fluctuation of human gait ,",
    "we study all the 30 samples classifying into three subjects : fast , normal , and slow . the scaling behaviors of the three classes of subjects , obtained by using de analysis , are shown in fig .",
    "2a , 2b and 2c , respectively .",
    "each figure contains 10 samples , of which the time scale is from 10 to 300 .",
    "the results indicate that the stride interval time series is not completely random ( uncorrelated ) , instead , it exhibits the scale - invariance property and long - range correlation at all the three walking rates .",

    "3 illustrates the dependence of @xmath4 on self - determined walking rate for all three subjects .",
    "for the 29 samples of 30 1-h trials , except one samples @xmath29 of the slow subject ( see fig.2c ) , the scale - invariant exponents @xmath4 is around @xmath1 ( range 0.663 to 0.955 ) .",
    "thus for all subjects at all rates , the stride interval time series displayed scaling behavior and long - range power law correlations .",
    "[ 0.8 ] ( color online ) dependence of @xmath4 on self - selected walking rate.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there are a strong similarity of @xmath4 on chosen walking rate : @xmath4 is @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 during the fast- , normal- , slow - walking trails , respectively ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in principle , the estimation of @xmath4 depends on the fitting range @xmath33 .",
    "it is preferable to have @xmath34 .",
    "however , due to the finite size of data , a larger @xmath35 may lead to a bigger error in @xmath4 @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "all the results are obtained by linear fitting within the region @xmath36 .",
    "in summary , by means of the de method we investigate the scaling behavior embedded in the time series of stride interval fluctuation .",
    "scale - invariance exponents of the three subjects are almost the same , being in the interval of @xmath37 $ ] , of which the mean value is @xmath1 . dynamical analysis of these step - to - step fluctuations reveals a self - similar pattern : fluctuation at one time scale are statistically similar to those at multiple other time scales , at least over hundreds of steps , while the healthy subjects walk at their normal rate .",
    "the long - rang correlation is observed during the spontaneous walking by removal of the drift or trend in the time series .",
