    "quantum correlations @xcite are essential ingredients in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "various quantum correlations , different in nature and types , find huge applications in quantum information theory .",
    "consequently , their characterization and quantification is a crucial task .",
    "several non - classical correlation measures have been proposed for bipartite quantum systems , and some of them have been extended to multipartite settings .",
    "mutual information , the reciprocal information that is common to or shared by two or more parties , has an authoritative stand in the arena .",
    "quantum mutual information ( qmi ) , whose definition is motivated by that of classical mutual information ( cmi ) , is well defined for bipartite quantum systems .",
    "qmi of a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is von neumann entropy and @xmath3 is quantum relative entropy .",
    "it is non - negative , and bears the interpretation of total correlation between the two subsystems @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the amount of work ( noise ) that is required to erase ( destroy ) the correlations completely .",
    "this is , however , no longer true for three or more party quantum systems .",
    "first , we consider three - variable cmi @xcite which is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is two - variable cmi , @xmath6 is three - variable conditional mutual information , and @xmath7 is shannon entropy .",
    "though both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are non - negative , the three - variable cmi can be negative . using the chain rule @xmath10 ,",
    "the following expressions of cmi are equivalent : @xmath11 \\nonumber \\\\ -[h(a , b)+h(a , c)+h(b , c)]+h(a , b , c).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath12    @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\ -[h(a , b)+h(a , c)]+h(a|b , c).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above definitions of cmi can be extended to the quantum domain .",
    "they are obtained by replacing the random variables by density matrices and shannon entropies by von neumann entropies , with appropriate measurements in the quantum conditional entropies .",
    "hence , @xmath14 \\nonumber \\\\ -[s(a , b)+s(a , c)+s(b , c)]+s(a , b , c),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath15    @xmath16 \\nonumber \\\\ -[s(a , b)+s(a , c)]+s_{{\\cal m}}(a|b , c),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the quantum conditional entropy obtained after some generalized measurement @xmath19 has been performed on subsystem @xmath20 .",
    "it is asserted that the above quantum expressions are not equivalent as measurement assumes its role in the quantum conditional entropies .",
    "qmis have certain drawbacks .",
    "first , surprisingly enough @xmath21 is identically zero for arbitrary three - party pure quantum states @xcite implying that mutual information among the subsystems of three - party pure quantum systems is zero .",
    "this is not true in the case of bipartite qmi .",
    "second , @xmath21 and other versions of qmi can be negative @xcite",
    ". how is this negative correlation useful for quantum information tasks ?",
    "though the existing definition of three - party qmi is argued to reveal the true nature of quantum correlations @xcite , the fact that qmi , being a measure of correlation , can assume negative value is confronting and unacceptable .",
    "this perplexing stance motivated us to propose an operational definition of multiparty qmi which is non - negative .",
    "this paper is divided into four sections . in sec .",
    "[ op - qmi ] , we provide operational definition of multiparty quantum mutual information , and compare with other mutual information . in sec .",
    "[ op - qd ] , we discuss multiparty quantum discord and present a few illustrations .",
    "we show that the symmetric version of quantum discord reveals the maximal quantumness .",
    "we finally conclude in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we propose an operational definition of multiparty quantum mutual information , henceforth operational quantum mutual information ( oqmi ) . for an @xmath22-party quantum state @xmath23 ,",
    "our definition takes into account the shared information among @xmath24-parties , @xmath25 , and not only the common information among all parties .",
    "this is absolutely reasonable as information can be distributed or stored among @xmath24-parties .",
    "this can be understood readily using venn diagram .      from fig .",
    "[ venn23scan](a ) , we see that the only way the subsystems @xmath26 and @xmath27 interact with each other is region  @xmath28 \" , i.e , @xmath29 . in entropy language , this translates as @xmath30 this is usual bipartite qmi .      from fig .",
    "[ venn23scan](b ) , the possible ways the subsystems @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath31 interact among each other is region  @xmath32 \" which is common to all three , and regions  @xmath28 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 \" which are pairwise common .",

    "-[s(ab)+s(ac)+s(bc)]+s(abc ) . \\label{qmi3common}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in doing so we have discarded pairwise interactions .",
    "however , a priori , there is no reason to throw them away .",
    "moreover , they can provide important information when examined together .",

    "the last inequality follows since @xmath41 .",

    "this contradicts the interpretation of measured mutual information as classical information because measuring more than one subsystem should yield more classical information and hence less quantum discord .",
    "a natural question then arises : whether the above observation is a property of the operational quantum discord , i.e. , quantum discord obtained using oqmi ?",
