    "the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) system , employing multiple transmit and receive antennas , has been recognized as an effective way to improve the spectral efficiency of the radio channel @xcite @xcite .",
    "more recently , multiuser schemes have been investigated for mimo systems to further improve the multiuser sum capacity .",
    "early studies have assumed a perfectly knowledge of the channel state information ( csi ) available at the transmitter .",
    "@xcite extended the single - user scheme @xcite to the multiuser system . however , without exploring the multiuser channel information , it simply treated the multiuser interference as the white noise .",
    "the scheme in @xcite , on the contrary , utilized the multiuser information effectively to minimize the total mean squared error ( tmmse ) and , naturally , possessed a better performance .",
    "the csi can be obtained at the transmitter either by using a feedback channel from the receiver to the transmitter in frequency division duplex ( fdd ) systems , or by invoking the channel reciprocity in time division duplex ( tdd ) systems . however , using feedback in fdd systems , the limited resources for the feedback , associated with the propagation delay and schedule lag , heavily degrade the accuracy of the csi at the transmitter . as to the channel reciprocity in tdd systems , the accuracy of the csi",
    "is corrupted by antenna calibration errors and turn - around time delay . in respect",
    "that the performance would degrade significantly under the imperfect csi , it is necessary to design a multiuser scheme which is stable to the imperfect csi .    in robust design methodologies , maxmin ( worst - case ) and bayesian ( stochastic )",
    "are two well known ones @xcite .",
    "the former optimizes the performance under the worst case of random channels , thus , it is so conservative that its average performance is even worse than non - robust schemes @xcite .",
    "the latter maximizes the ensemble average performance over a pre - described stochastic distribution of the csi .",
    "when the stochastic distribution matches well with the true csi , the latter outperforms the former .",
    "the scheme in @xcite was a bayesian design for downlink multiuser mimo systems with the imperfectly known csi .",
    "it introduced a channel error matrix to the cost function of @xcite , then found the solution which minimized the average cost .",
    "however , similar with @xcite , the multiuser interference was also treated as the white noise .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the performance can be improved by exploring the multiuser information .    in this paper , a robust scheme for downlink multiuser mimo systems is proposed based on the tmmse criterion . a more general channel model involving the channel mean and antenna correlation is considered .",
    "the scheme is a bayesian design which minimizes the average cost function under the sum power constraint .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the channel model and problem formulation are described in section ii .",
    "the section iii presents the design of the robust multiuser scheme for the correlated imperfect known channel under the sum power constraint .",
    "simulation results and analysis are given in section iv . finally , the section v concludes the paper .",

    "represented by a matrix @xmath13 , the downlink mimo channel to ms@xmath14 is assumed to be frequency - flat and quasi - static block fading .",
    "suppose a non - zero - mean channel with both transmit and receive antenna correlations , @xmath15 is written as follows @xcite@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ratio of the power in the mean component to the average power in the variant component of @xmath15 ; @xmath18 is random , we assume that its entries form an independent identical distribution ( i.i.d . ) complex gaussian collection with zero - mean and identity covariance , i.e. , @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the normalized channel mean , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the normalized correlation matrices of the receiver of ms@xmath14 and the transmitter of bs , respectively .",

    "furthermore , the channel model ( 2 ) can also denote the correlated rician mimo channel , in which case the channel mean represents the line - of - sight ( los ) component of the mimo channel .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that transmitters and receivers only know channel means and antenna correlations .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath27 substreams between bs and ms@xmath28 , that is to say , bs transmits @xmath29 symbols to ms@xmath14 simultaneously .",
    "then the signal received at ms@xmath14 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the received signal vector , and @xmath32 is the transmitted signal vector from bs to ms@xmath14 with zero - mean and normalized covariance matrix @xmath33 .",
    "we assume the transmitted signal vectors of different users are uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the kronecker function , @xmath36 , when @xmath37 and @xmath38 , when @xmath39 .",
    "we also assume the noise vector is independent of any signal vector .",
    "a linear post - filter @xmath40 is used at ms@xmath14 to recover an estimation of the transmitted signal vector @xmath41 . @xmath15",
    "defined in ( 1 ) [ or ( 2 ) ] denotes the mimo channel from bs to ms@xmath14 .",
    "@xmath42 is used at bs to weight the transmitted signal vector @xmath41 .",

    "hence , we get    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the total transmit power of bs .",
    "according to ( 3 ) , the @xmath9-th user s mse is @xmath55 substitute ( 2 ) into ( 5 ) and note @xmath56 , hence @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58 observe the last part in ( 6 ) @xmath59    moreover , as @xmath19 with i.i.d .",

    "so the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions @xcite of ( 4 ) are @xmath69 among them , ( 13)(14 ) come from the fact that the gradients of the lagrangian ( 12 ) definitely vanish at the optimal point , and ( 15 ) is known as the complementary slackness . according to ( 11)@xmath70(14 ) , we obtain @xmath71 @xmath72    substitute ( 18 ) into ( 15 ) , we can find @xmath68 is the root of the equation @xmath73 where @xmath74 @xmath75 as @xmath76 is the normalized correlation matrix of the transmitter , it is hermitian , hence both @xmath77 and @xmath78 are hermitian , and so is @xmath79 .",
    "perform the eigenvalue decomposition @xmath80 where @xmath81 is unitary and @xmath82 is diagonal . if @xmath83 , ( 19 ) can be rewritten to @xmath84_{n , n } } } { { ( d_n   + \\lambda ) ^2 } } }   - p = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the @xmath86-th diagonal element of @xmath87 . using a binary search , the root of ( 23 ) can be found quickly .",
    "since the left - hand side of ( 23 ) is monotonous in @xmath68 when @xmath88 , the upper and lower bounds on @xmath68 can be acquired by replacing @xmath85 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "thus ,    @xmath91    @xmath92    where @xmath93 means that the expression takes the value inside the parentheses if the value is positive , otherwise it takes zero . a numerical binary search ,",
    "then , can be carried out between these two bounds to find the root of ( 23 ) up to a desired precision .",
    "once there is no root between the bounds , which implies that the inequality constraint ( 16 ) is inactive , @xmath94 is the only available solution to ( 18 ) . from ( 17 ) ( 18 ) , it can be found that the optimal transmit matrices @xmath95 are functions of the receive matrices @xmath96 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore an iterative algorithm to calculate @xmath97 and @xmath95 is proposed as follows .",
    "in this section , numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme .",
    "we assume that the bs equipped with four antennas ( @xmath98 ) is communicating with two ms s ( @xmath99 ) each with @xmath100 receive antennas ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "also we assume that the number of substreams of each ms is equal to @xmath102 @xmath103 , moreover , both the two ms s have the same @xmath17 @xmath104 .",
    "qpsk is employed in the simulations and no channel coding is considered .",
    "let the transmit antenna correlation matrix @xmath76 be @xmath105_{i , j } = 0.9^{|i - j|}$ ] and the receive antennas be uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath106 .",
    "firstly , we compare the bit error rate ( ber ) of the proposed robust tmmse scheme with that of the traditional tmmse scheme . defining the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as the ratio of total transmitted power to the noise power of each antenna ( @xmath107 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig 1 ] is the average ber curves versus the snr when @xmath108 . in order to highlight its impact on the ber performance , different values of @xmath109",
    "are used in the evaluations .",
    "when @xmath109 is small , the channel mean poorly reflects the instantaneous channel state , thus the receiver can not completely eliminate the interference among the transmitted signals , which further induces an irreducible error floor at high snr region",
    ". however , the proposed robust scheme overcomes the traditional one with a noticeable gain .",
    "as the @xmath109 increases , the transmitter obtains more precise csi , therefore the residual interference is mitigated greatly and the error floor vanishes .",
    "in addition , the gain between the proposed robust scheme and the traditional one turns small when the uncertainty of the channel state is decreasing .    in fig . [",
    "fig 2 ] , we compare the ber performance when the number of receive antennas is increasing .",
    "the additional receive antennas provide more spatial diversity gain . in this figure , @xmath109 is fixed to be @xmath110 and @xmath100 changes from @xmath102 to @xmath111 . although both the two schemes explore the additional receive diversity gain , the proposed robust scheme obviously has a better performance for all @xmath100 s due to its insensitivity to the imperfect csi .     and @xmath112.,width=288,height=240 ]     and @xmath113.,width=288,height=240 ]     and @xmath114db.,width=288,height=240 ]     and @xmath115.,width=288,height=220 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig 3 ] shows the average mse as a function of @xmath109 , when snr = @xmath116db and @xmath108 .",
    "the average mse of the proposed robust scheme is less than that of the traditional tmmse scheme over all @xmath109 s .",
    "moreover , compared to the traditional tmmse , the descending slope of the proposed robust scheme is flat , which further indicates that its performance is insensitive to the channel uncertainty .",
    "especially when @xmath109 becomes larger , more reliable csi is available , therefore closer the two curves get .    fig .",
    "[ fig 4 ] illustrates the convergence property of the proposed robust scheme , when @xmath117 , @xmath115 .",
    "the curves of the average mse versus the number of iterations needed in different snr s are plotted .",
    "the higher the snr is , the more iterations the proposed scheme runs for to converge .",
    "fortunately , for the most snr s , four iterations are big enough to guarantee the convergence .",
    "in this paper , we investigate a robust linear processing scheme for the downlink multiuser mimo system under the consideration of imperfect csi . as the traditional downlink multiuser mimo systems depend on the instantaneous csi too much , they suffer poor performance once the csi is not accurate enough . in order to deliver a better performance under the imperfect csi , an iterative bayesian algorithm which explores channel statistics to offer a much more stable description to the channel state",
    "is developed by minimize the total mse under the sum power constraint .",
    "numerical simulations exhibit the proposed robust scheme experiences an obvious performance gain over the traditional schemes .",
    "in addition , the proposed iterative algorithm has a good convergence property  after no more than four times of iterations , the algorithm achieves convergence .",
