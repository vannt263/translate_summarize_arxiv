    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) serve as distance indicators used to measure the expansion history of the universe . although supernovae are not perfect standard candles , the peak absolute magnitude of an individual event can be inferred from observed multi - band light curves and a redshift using trained empirical relations .",
    "sn  ia optical light curves have homogeneous time evolution , which allowed them to be described by a template .",
    "the relationship between light - curve decline rates and their correlation with absolute magnitude was noted by @xcite and further developed by @xcite , and was confirmed with the supernovae observed by the calan / tololo survey @xcite .",
    "an observed - color parameter was added to the modeling of multi - band light curves .",
    "today there is a suite of models that parameterize supernova light - curve shapes and colors , which are used to standardize absolute magnitudes to within a seemingly random @xmath7@xmath8 mag dispersion .",
    "the host galaxy conveys information about the supernova progenitor environment .",
    "although they do not describe an individual star , the host mass , specific star formation rate , and metallicity provide an expectation of the progenitor initial conditions that can be related to peak absolute magnitude .",
    "dependence of light - curve parameters and hubble residuals ( inferred magnitudes from light curves minus those expected from the cosmological distance - redshift relation , or hubble law ) on global host - galaxy properties has been sought .",

    "* hereafter c13a ) .",
    "their findings are consistent with previous studies ; when splitting the sn ia sample by host mass , ssfr , and metallicity at @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 respectively , they find that sne ia in high - mass ( low - ssfr , high - metallicity ) hosts are on average @xmath12 mag ( @xmath13 mag , @xmath14 mag ) brighter than those in low - mass ( high - ssfr , low - metallicity ) hosts after brightness corrections based on the salt2 light - curve shape and color brightness corrections .",
    "the hubble residuals depend on the model used to determine absolute magnitude .",
    "although there is the expectation that the progenitor variability tracked by host - galaxy parameters must also be directly manifest within the supernova signal itself , it appears not to be captured by the light - curve models used and the associated standardization in the cited work .",

    "the @xmath5 parameter affects peak colors in a fashion inconsistent with dust ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 are positively correlated ) , controls the near - uv light curve width , and influences the light - curve decline 20 to 30-days after peak brightness .",
    "the @xmath22 parameter most notably affects peak color and the light - curve shape through all phases of the @xmath23 band .",
    "the k13 light curve parameters capture light - curve diversity distinct from those of salt2 ; figure 10 shows plots of salt2 versus k13 light - curve parameters .",
    "the absolute magnitude at peak @xmath24-band brightness is taken to be an unknown function of a set of 15 light - curve parameters ; after modeling the function as a gaussian process and training , the absolute magnitude can be determined to a dispersion as low as 0.09 mag .",

    "flux - calibrated multi - band light curves are composed of synthetic photometry calculated by integrating spectra over the transmission function of observer optical @xmath28 bands .",
    "we are interested in the light - curve parameters and hubble residuals of the supernovae analyzed in k13 ( the same studied by c13b ) .",
    "the objective of k13 was to calibrate absolute magnitudes at peak brightness based on light - curve shapes and colors .",
    "the goal of this article is to examine possible biases in hubble residuals , not to minimize the dispersion as in k13 ; we therefore use a different sample selection increasing the number of supernovae used in this analysis to improve the statistics .",
    "the supernova subsamples considered in our analysis are summarized in table  [ samples : tab ] .",
    "our * full * sample requires @xmath29 points over all bands with @xmath30 : this ensures temporal coverage to inform the regression of the multi - band light curves from roughly ten days before to forty days after @xmath24 maximum light .",

    "the calibration of absolute magnitudes is trained for the specific restframe wavelengths probed by the observation , and several filter sets were considered .",
    "the dispersion in hubble residuals of the validation sample of 43 sne was smallest for the absolute - magnitude calibration for the @xmath38-band of the blueshifted dark energy survey @xmath28 filter set , i.e.  the rest - frame bands of a supernova at redshift @xmath39 covered by standard @xmath28 , which amount to supernova - frame effective wavelengths of 378 , 497 , 602 , and 708 nm .",
    "these filters are annotated with a superscript @xmath40 . as our objective is to see how well sn  ia distances",
    "could be calibrated without restricting ourselves to a specific observer filter system , we use this particular training to look for the dependence of light - curve parameters and hubble residuals on host - galaxy properties .",
    "the hubble residuals are calculated as the difference between the true and inferred peak magnitudes of the gaussian - process model from table  5 in k13 ; the true magnitude being that regressed by the light - curve model , the inferred being that regressed from light - curve shape and color parameters . they perform four distinct analyses with different training and validation sets such that each supernova was in a validation set once and only once .",
    "for each supernova , the tabulated absolute magnitude is the one inferred while it was part of the validation set ; in this work the hubble residuals of all supernovae are treated collectively even though they were not analyzed with the same trained model .",
    "the statistics of interest in this article can not benefit and in fact suffer from the overtraining of light - curve and absolute - magnitude models that can occur in the training process of k13 .",
    "not all supernovae were used in the trainings of the k13 model ; `` training '' subsets were used to specify the supernova model , which in turn were used to predict absolute magnitudes of independent `` validation '' subsets . each absolute magnitude used in the current article",
    "was determined while the supernova was in the validation set , i.e.  the training did not include the supernova itself .",
    "any overtraining of the training set thus appears as an added source of error in the absolute magnitudes .",
    "in the present article , the signals of interest are deviations of hubble residuals that are correlated with host - galaxy properties ; no host - galaxy property information was used in the determination of the absolute magnitudes .",
    "the early sample is a fair sample with which to examine the k13 analysis and training : supernovae lacking rise - time data extends the gaussian process regression outside of its expected range of applicability as peak magnitudes would then be extrapolated rather than interpolated .",
    "the light curves in extrapolated regions revert toward the mean function ( the updated template of @xcite in the analysis of k13 ) , and have uncertainties bounded by the gaussian process kernel model rather than data . for this reason ,",
    "the k13 training sample was restricted to supernovae with data earlier than 2 days before maximum .",
    "we look for a correlation between light - curve parameters and the global host - galaxy properties of c13a in the early sample .",

    "the @xmath16 light curve parameter is associated with color and exhibits similar trends as the salt2 @xmath41 parameter shown in c13b ; larger ( redder ) values trending with higher mass and metallicity hosts as could be explained by host - galaxy dust absorption or a color - metallicity dependence .",
    "the @xmath4 parameter is correlated with salt2 @xmath17 and a smaller range of @xmath4 values in low - mass and low - metallicity hosts is apparent .",

    "there are no low @xmath5 values in low - metallicity hosts .",

    "the positive correlation between the residuals shows that the two methods are subject to shared `` intrinsic dispersion '' that is irreducible for both .    over the entire early sample",

    "the gp analysis has an advantage in that it nulls out population effects by having training and validation sets drawn from a common sample .",
    "nevertheless , if salt2 did capture the diversity of light curves no bias would arise due to differing training and validation populations assuming that systematic changes in absolute magnitude are accompanied with changes in the time - evolving sed .",
    "the continued study of correlations between host - galaxy properties and hubble residuals is of importance even as tools that measure distances improve .",
    "correlations serve as important diagnostics of potential biases related to progenitor population that are not captured by light - curve parameters or absolute magnitude inference .",
    "better accuracy can be achieved from local host - galaxy properties extracted from the region around the supernova @xcite , which can give a more accurate view of the progenitor environment compared to global properties .",
    "physically , there is the expectation that multi - band light curves with broad wavelength coverage transmit information about the progenitor system . due to limitations in current light - curve fitters ,",
    "some of this information has only been noted indirectly through host - galaxy properties .",
    "this article shows that the novel light - curve analysis of k13 may be capturing more aspects of sn  ia diversity .",
    "application of the method to more supernovae will provide better statistics to test this hypothesis .",

    "<S> @xcite [ k13 ] introduced a new methodology for determining peak - brightness absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae from multi - band light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the relation between their parameterization of light curves and hubble residuals , based on photometry synthesized from the nearby supernova factory spectrophotometric time series , with global host - galaxy properties . </S>",
    "<S> the k13 hubble residual step with host mass is @xmath0 mag for a supernova subsample with data coverage corresponding to the k13 training ; at @xmath1 , the step is not significant and lower than previous measurements . </S>",
    "<S> relaxing the data coverage requirement the hubble residual step with host mass is @xmath2 mag for the larger sample ; a calculation using the modes of the distributions , less sensitive to outliers , yields a step of 0.019 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this article uses k13 inferred luminosities , as distinguished from previous works that use magnitude corrections as a function of salt2 color and stretch parameters : steps at @xmath3 significance are found in salt2 hubble residuals in samples split by the values of their k13 @xmath4 and @xmath5 light - curve parameters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 affects the light - curve width and color around peak ( similar to the @xmath6 and stretch parameters ) , and @xmath5 affects colors , the near - uv light - curve width , and the light - curve decline 20 to 30 days after peak brightness </S>",
    "<S> . the novel light - curve analysis , increased parameter set , and magnitude corrections of k13 may be capturing features of sn  ia diversity arising from progenitor stellar evolution . </S>"
