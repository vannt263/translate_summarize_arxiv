    "high energy physics experiments are designed to resolve the yet - unanswered questions in the standard model  ( sm ) through searches of new physics  ( np ) using two approaches : high energy or high luminosity approach .",
    "the first approach is to use high energy collider to produce and discover new particles directly .",
    "the second one is to measure flavor physics observables at for example b factory experiments and search for the signal or evidence of a deviation from the sm prediction .",

    "the rare b decays are all induced by the so - called box and/or penguin diagrams .",
    "since these rare decay modes are highly suppressed in the sm , they may serve as a good hunting ground for testing the sm and probing possible np effects .    at the quark level , the decays @xmath13 proceed via fcnc transition @xmath14 .",
    "the decays @xmath13 will be one of the most important rare decays to be studied at the lhcb experiment and other b physics experiments . the theoretically predicted branching ratio has the value of @xmath15 for the @xmath16 mode  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation was first done by cdf collaboration  @xcite and the updated branching fraction is  @xcite @xmath17\\times10^{-6}.\\ ] ] which is consistent with the sm prediction .",
    "however , the experimental errors are still large and this decay allow for sizable np contributions .",
    "we will evaluate the effects of possible np in these decays in the topcolor - assisted model .",
    "the decays @xmath13 have been studied by employing the low - energy effective hamiltonian and nonperturbative approaches to compute the decay form factors in the framework of the sm  @xcite .",
    "many studies about possible new physics contributions to these decays induced by loop diagrams involving various new particles have been published , for example , in the two higgs doublet model  @xcite , the universal extra dimension scenario  @xcite , the family non - universal @xmath1 model  @xcite and other new physics scenarios  @xcite .",
