    "in out - of - equilibrium systems , directed transport can be obtained without the application of a net bias force .",
    "such a counter - intuitive phenomenon is usually termed the ratchet effect @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a directed current in such systems can be precisely related to the breaking of the relevant spatio - temporal symmetries @xcite .",
    "an intriguing feature of ratchets are current reversals , where the sign of the generated current changes following a variation in a system parameter @xcite . as a specific example , consider the case of a rocking ratchet , consisting of brownian particles in an asymmetric sawtooth potential . a sinusoidal rocking force drives the system out of equilibrium , thus allowing the generation of directed transport .",
    "in such a system , current reversals can be observed by varying the noise strength at fixed amplitude of the rocking force , as well as by varying the force amplitude while keeping constant the noise strength @xcite . the key feature of current reversals is that the sign of the current can be reversed by varying a system parameter , although the considered parameter does not change the symmetry of the hamiltonian . at first sight",
    "this suggests that current reversals are a dynamical phenomenon , not traceble back to a symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "previous theoretical work aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying current reversals in rocking ratchets . for an underdamped deterministic ratchet , mateos @xcite argued that current reversals induced by a variation of the driving strength correspond to a bifurcation from a chaotic to a periodic regime .",
    "however , the proposed mechanisms turned out not to be general , as in the very same system current reversals can be observed also in the absence of such bifurcations , and moreover not all chaos - to - order transitions necessarily lead to current reversals @xcite .    a different approach toward the understanding of current reversals induced by a variation of the rocking force amplitude was recently introduced for a biharmonically driven spatially symmetric rocking ratchet @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a class of current reversals is precisely determined by symmetry breaking . in this way",
    ", a link was established between dynamical and symmetry - breaking mechanisms .",
    "the still open issue now is to which extent the above link can be generalized , either to different systems or to current reversals of different type in the same set - up .    in the present work ,",
    "we generalise the link between dynamical and symmetry - breaking mechanisms introduced in the aforementioned work .",
    "we consider the same ratchet system and examine the current reversals induced by a variation of the frequency of the rocking force .",
    "we notice that a variation of the rocking force frequency can not be mapped onto a variation of the force amplitude , i.e. the current reversals considered here are not a priori equivalent to the ones observed by varying the force strength .",
    "our experimental and theoretical work shows that also in this case there is a class of current reversals that are determined by symmetry breaking , thus generalizing the argument put forward in ref .",

    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the ratchet set - up used in this work , and recall the elements of the symmetry analysis that will be needed to establish the link between current reversals in the frequency domain and dissipation - induced symmetry breaking .",
    "section iii presents experimental results obtained with cold atoms in a driven optical lattice in the regime of weak damping .",

    "in this work we consider a ratchet set - up consisting of brownian particles in a spatially symmetric periodic potential driven by a time - asymmetric force . to capture the main features of the dynamics , in the theoretical analysis we consider the simple case of a linear friction , as usually considered in the ratchet literature .",
    "this will also allow us to explore different regimes of damping and noise .",
    "the relevant langevin equation is in this case : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a periodic potential , @xmath2 is the friction coefficient , @xmath3 is a gaussian white noise : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a biharmonic drive described by : @xmath7~. \\label{eq : drive}\\ ] ]    the appearance of a ratchet - effect , i.e. the generation of directed motion , in such a set - up is a very well established fact @xcite .",
    "we now recall the essential elements of the symmetry analysis that , initially developed to explain the generation of a current @xcite , will allow us to introduce the basic concepts that will be needed to establish the link between current reversals in the frequency domain and dissipation - induced symmetry breaking .    in general ,",
    "the symmetry analysis @xcite is used to identify the symmetry of the system which prevent directed motion . for the specific case of a spatially symmetric potential , of interest here",
    ", there are two of those symmetries : the shift symmetry , which corresponds to invariance under the transformation @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the period of the drive , and the time - reversal symmetry , which requires invariance under the transformation @xmath10 . a bi - harmonic drive of the form of eq .  [ eq : drive ] breaks the shift symmetry for any value of the relative phase @xmath11 . for the time - reversal symmetry",
    "it is necessary to distinguish different cases , corresponding to different levels of dissipation . for no dissipation ( hamiltonian case ) ,",
    "the system is symmetric under time - reversal for @xmath12 with @xmath13 integer , and therefore for these values directed motion can not be produced .",
