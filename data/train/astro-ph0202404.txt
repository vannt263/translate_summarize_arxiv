    "according to the current fireball model a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) contain four stages :",
    "( i ) a catastrophic event produces an ` inner pine engine ' .",
    "( ii ) this ` inner engine ' accelerates a barionic wind into a highly relativistic motion .",
    "( iii ) internal collisions within this wind produce the prompt @xmath1-ray emission ( iv ) an external - shock between the wind and the surrounding matter produces the afterglow .",
    "the most mysterious part of this process is the nature of the ` inner engine ' .",
    "there are no direct observations of the ` inner engine ' .",
    "numerical simulations ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ; ramirez & fenimore , 2000 ) revealed that the @xmath1-rays light curve replicates the temporal activity of the inner engine. in this letter we explain , using a simple analytic toy model , these results . in our toy model",
    "the relativistic wind is described as a sequence of discrete shells with various lorentz factors , @xmath2 . the @xmath1-rays light curve results from collisions between shells with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the observed time of a pulse ( resulting from such a collision ) reflects the time that the inner faster shell was ejected from the ` inner engine ' .",
    "we show that unless the background noise prevents the detection of some pulses , the light curve reflects one third to one half of the shells ejection time .",
    "nakar & piran ( 2001 ) discovered that the pulses width , @xmath3 , and the intervals between pulses , @xmath4 , have a similar distributions .",
    "moreover , the duration of an interval between pulses is correlated with the width of the following pulse .",
    "our analysis shows that in an internal shocks model with equal energy shells both the intervals and the pulses widths reflect the initial separation between the shells .",
    "therefore , both observational results arise naturally in this model .",
    "if instead the shells mass is constant then the intervals still reflects the shells separation but the pulses widths depend also on the distribution of the shells lorentz factors . in this case",
    "the variance in @xmath1 wipes out both the @xmath5-@xmath6 similarity and the correlation .",
    "our toy model includes some simplifying assumptions .",
    "we confirm these results using numerical simulations .",
    "the equal energy simulation fit the observations very well , while the equal mass model does not fit the observations .",
    "these results suggest that the ` inner engine ' produces a variable lorentz factor flow by modulating the mass of a constant energy flow .",
    "these results provide yet another strong support to the internal shock model .",
    "they also give one of the first clues on the nature of the ` inner engine ' .",
    "in our toy model the ` inner engine ' emits relativistic shells which collides and produce the observed light curve .",
    "we make the following simplifying assumptions : ( i ) the shells are discrete and homogeneous .",
    "each shell has a well define boundaries and a well defined @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) the colliding shells merge into a single shell after the collision .",
    "( iii ) only efficient collisions produce an observable pulse .",
    "the efficiency , @xmath7 , is defined as the ratio between the post shock internal energy and the total energy .",
    "we consider only collisions with @xmath8 .    under these assumptions each shell",
    "is defined by four parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the shell index , @xmath14 is the ejection time of the shell , and @xmath15 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 are the mass , lorentz factor and width of the shell respectively . for convenience",
    "we define @xmath17 , the interval between the rear end of the ith shell and the front of the jth shell .",
    "note that @xmath18 .",
    "consider a single collision between two shells with widths @xmath19 , @xmath20 , a separation @xmath21 , and ejection times @xmath22 .",
    "we define @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the collision efficiency depends strongly on @xmath26 ( piran 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath27 , and it decreases fast with decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "hence , we consider only collisions with @xmath28 .",
    "the collision takes place at : @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is measured in the rest frame ) .",
    "note that as long as @xmath28 , @xmath31 depends rather weakly on @xmath32 .",
    "the emitted photons from the collision reach the observer at time ( omitting the photons flight time ) : @xmath33 the photons from the collision are observed almost simultaneously with an hypothetical photon emitted from the ` inner engine ' together with the faster shell ( at @xmath34 ) .",
    "this result is accurate up to an error of @xmath35 , which is small compared to @xmath21 as long as @xmath28 .",
    "the light curve obtained from multiple collisions can be described in terms of three basic pairs of collisions ( see fig .",
    "[ types fig ] ) : ( i ) two collisions between four consequent shells with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the collision are between the first and the second shells and between the third and the forth shells .",
    "( ii ) two collisions between three consequent shells with @xmath38 .",
    "the two front shells collide and then the third shell collides with the merged one .",
    "( iii ) same as type ii but here the rear shells collide first .",
    "type i collisions result in two observed pulses , the first at @xmath39 and the second at @xmath40 .",
    "the interval between the pulses , @xmath4 , would be : @xmath41 . in type ii collisions the first pulse is observed at @xmath34 , and second pulse is observed at @xmath42 .",
    "the interval is : @xmath43 . in type",
    "iii collisions the last shell takes over the second one , and the first pulse is observed at @xmath42 .",
    "then the merged shell takes over the first one releasing another pulse observed at @xmath44 . therefore type iii collisions , results in a single wide pulse .",
    "all these results are accurate up to an order of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ratio of the lorentz factors between the two colliding shells .",
    "as long as the collisions are efficient , these results depend weakly on the mass distribution of the shells .",
    "the relevant time scales that determine the pulse width are ( piran , 1999 ) : ( i ) the angular time , @xmath47 , which results from the spherical geometry of the shells : @xmath48 .",
    "( ii ) the hydrodynamic time , @xmath49 , which arises from the shell s width and the shock crossing time : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the width of the inner shell at the time of the collision .",
    "( iii ) the cooling time - the time that it takes for the emitting electrons to cool . for synchrotron emission with typical parameters of internal shocks",
    "this time is much shorter then @xmath47 and @xmath52 ( kobayashi et .",
    "1997 , wu & fenimore 2000 ) .",
    "therefore under the assumption of transparent shells the pulse width is @xmath53 .    unlike the pulse s timing",
    ", the pulse s width depends strongly on the shells masses .",
    "the relevant lorentz factor for the calculation is the one of the shocked , and therefore radiating , region - @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath54 depends strongly on the ratio of the shells masses .",
    "we examine two possible cases : equal mass shells and equal energy shells .",
    "table [ dt - dt table ] summarizes the intervals and the pulses width for the two different mass distributions for the three types of collisions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     both results are in a perfect agreement with the analytical results obtained in section [ analytical model ] .",
    "the similarity between the `` observed '' interval distribution in both models is explained by the weak dependence of the pulses timing on the mass distribution .",
    "the pulses width in the equal energy model reflection of the shells initial separation , @xmath21 , are explained by the analytical result @xmath55 .",
    "the deviation from a lognormal distribution and the short pulses in the equal mass model are explained by the analytical result @xmath56 .",
    "nakar & piran ( 2001 ) find a correlation between an interval duration and the following pulse . in the equal energy model we find a highly significant correlation between the interval duration and the following pulse .",
    "there is no significant correlation in the equal mass model .",
    "this result is explained again by the equal mass relation @xmath57 . as the variations in @xmath26 are larger then the variations in @xmath21 it wipe out the correlation .",
    "former numerical simulations of internal shocks have shown that the resulting light curves reflect the activity of the inner engine .",
    "we have shown that this feature arise from the fact that the pulse timing is approximately equal to the ejection time of one of the colliding shell . moreover , in most collisions ( types i & ii ) the pulses are distinguishable and each pulse reflects a single collision . in all models",
    "the number of observed pulses is 30%-50% of the number of ejected shells .",
    "therefore the light curve reflects the emission time of one third to one half of the shells .",
    "the ` inner engine ' is slightly more variable then the observed light curve .    the observed similarity between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions",
    "is explained naturally in the equal energy shells model .",
    "both parameters reflects the the separation between the shells during their ejection . in the equal mass shells model only @xmath4",
    "reflects the initial shells separation and therefore such a similarity is not expected .",
    "our numerical simulations confirmed these predictions .",
    "note that many of the simplifying assumptions can be relaxed with no significant change in the results .",
    "we present elsewhere a more detailed model and more elaborated simulations ( nakar & piran , 2002 ) .",
    "the equal energy model simulations fit the observations very well .",
    "these results imply that the ` inner engine ' ejects , most likely , equal energy shells .",
    "these results are yet another strong support to the internal shock model .",
    "they also give one of the first clues on the nature of the ` inner engine ' .      1 kobayashi s. ,",
