    "a blurred image carries less information than a sharp image . due to the confined focal depth , it is hard to capture an image in which all objects / areas of the scene appear quite sharp . only the objects of a scene that are near the focus plane or at the focus plane appear sharp . to handle such situations the images",
    "are acquired using a number of imaging sensors or with multi focus imaging . after taking images , high contrast regions from each of the acquired images",
    "are selected and fused together to create an image that is in focus everywhere .",
    "the fusion process reduces the uncertainty and redundancy from the source images .",
    "there are a number of benefits of using the fusion process including reduced uncertainty , wider temporal and spatial coverage and improved reliability @xcite .",
    "image fusion is basically used due to the limited characteristic of image sensors .",
    "visual sensor networks are crucial in monitoring and surveillance , tracking and object recognition .",
    "now - a - days visual sensor networks provide help in solving various kind of problems related to research .",
    "there are multiple applications of multi - focus imaging such as in macro - photography , wireless image sensor network , focus stacking etc . in the case of wireless image sensor networks",
    "( wisn ) , it is hard to describe the critical situation precisely with a single image . a number of sensors are utilized to receive images of the same scene , and a centralized fusion centre cartels images from various sensors into a single image , the resultant image is amicable for human visual and machine processing @xcite .",
    "then , the blended image is channelized to a higher node .",
    "the simplest image fusion approach is averaging in which two images are merged by taking average of their individual pixels .",
    "the other approaches are : choose maximum absolute or minimum absolute value of pixel intensity in two or more images .",
    "but , these approaches suffer from lower performance and bad visual quality .",
    "further , these methods are integrated with different spatial and frequency domain processing methods to improve the output image quality @xcite .",
    "initial development of fusion takes place in spatial domain because of its simplicity and low computational complexity .",
    "but , use of spatial domain processes result in many undesirable effects such as blurring , low contrast and other spatial degradation .",
    "these undesirable effects imposed by spatial domain algorithms can be handled in frequency domain .",
    "so , the focus is shifting to multi - scale transforms and its various types of applications .",
    "various fusion algorithms for multi - focus images are available using multi - scale transform @xcite .",
    "the most used multi - scale transform is wavelet transform .",
    "there are a number of algorithms for image fusion that use wavelet transform @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a statistical sharpness measure is used on wavelet coefficients to perform adaptive image fusion in the wavelet domain . instead of using dwt to decompose images into the frequency domain , discrete stationary wavelet transform ( dswt )",
    "is used to overcome the lack of translation invariance of the dwt @xcite .",
    "as the wavelets do not represent long edges well in the fused images , multi - focus image fusion is performed by combining both the wavelet and curvelet transforms to improve the quality @xcite .",
    "methods based on multi - scale transforms such as non - subsampled contourlet transform ( nsct ) , shift invariant discrete wavelet transform ( sidwt ) , and discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) are popular @xcite . however , a majority of the image blending methods based on multi - scale transform are complex and time - consuming , which limit their applications for wireless visual sensor networks equipped with constrained resources .",
    "compliance with the image compression standards provide greater flexibility and portability to image fusion processes and algorithms .",
    "the most widely used image compression standards are jpeg and jpeg2000 . in spite of having greater advantages over jpeg",
    ", jpeg2000 is not used in many in applications because of its complexity . in jpeg",
    "discrete cosine transform ( dct ) is used to compress the images .",
    "so , the dct domain image fusion will be efficient and less time consuming .",
    "if the raw images are fused and compressed at source end ( where images are generated ) , the compressed images take less bandwidth and less space in transmission and storage for further processing . in this paper",
    "we propose a method based on contrast measurement in the dct domain with a reduced computational complexity . the proposed method has equal / better visual and quantitative performance as that of methods proposed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the remaining paper is arranged as follows : section ii presents the brief discussion on dct domain fusion concept .",
    "section iii outlines the proposed approach of image fusion .",
    "section iv explains the hardware architecture .",
    "section v analyses the experimental results , followed by conclusions in section vi .",
    "this section presents some of the most widely used concepts and algorithms based on dct domain processing . in all of the dct",
    "based fusion methods the maximum or average rule for fusion is applied as per the different contrast measurement criteria .",
    "jinshan tang @xcite proposed two methods namely ; dct+contrast and dct+average . in dct+average",
    ", the dct coefficient of the image is averaged to form a new fused image , but due to the averaging of the dct coefficients the output image gets blurred .",
    "this method is not preferred due to its poor image quality .",
    "the dct+contrast method utilizes the concept of contrast assessment presented by tang et al .",
    "@xcite . in this method ,",
    "each of the blocks is partitioned into fifteen bands of frequency as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the sharpness of each of the coefficients in a frequency band is given as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average amplitude over the spectral band .",
    "both the methods are criticised because of their poor performance on different evaluation criteria @xcite .",
    "haghighat et al .",
    "@xcite proposed another method based on variance in dct domain , namely dct+variance . since variance is a better criterion than mean to estimate the contrast in the image .",
    "this method leads to a better performance than dct+contrast and dct+avarage .",
    "the variance in dct domain is given as : @xmath4        1     1     however , experimental results show that the use of variance results in a lower performance compared to that of other focus measures @xcite .",
    "the variance calculation is computationally complex because it involves floating point multiplication and division .",
    "so , it may not be suitable for resource constrained environments .",
    "the dct+variance method is also criticised due to its computational intensive nature . to overcome the computational intensive nature , phamila et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed another method based on number of high valued ac coefficient in a dct block .",
    "though his method reduces the overall computational complexity and energy requirement , but number of high value ac coefficient is not a good criterion to identify the maximum variance block in an image .",
    "cao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a method named as dct+sf .",
    "the spatial frequency calculation in dct domain is given as : @xmath5    where _",
    "e(i , j ) _ is the spatial frequency operator in the dct domain .",
    "calculating spatial frequency in dct domain is computationally more complex than dct+variance . due to small size of sensors , various kinds of design constraints",
    "are imposed by wireless images sensor network ( wisn ) on designers such as computational complexity , computational power , communication channels , image compression , and power consumption .    for resource constrained environments such as wisn , space application or any remote sensing application , the fusion method should exhibit following properties : 1 ) it should be computationally less complex , 2 ) it should consume less power , 3 ) should be easier to implement on different platforms such as hardware , software or dsp platforms .",
    "in the dct domain coefficient _ d(0,0 ) _ represents the dc value , also know as the mean value of the image block .",
    "the rest of the dct coefficients ( ac coefficients ) represent the high frequency information of the image block . determining the spatial frequency through the ac components of dct",
    "is a computationally intensive task and also not suitable for resource constrained real - time applications such as a wisn .",
    "the coefficients of dct itself represent spatial frequency content in given frequency band .",
    "as dct is the part of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , the definition of contrast measurement in dft can also be utilised for dct .",
    "the issue of contrast of complex scenes at different spatial frequencies can be addressed as follows @xcite :",
    "@xmath6    where c represents the sharpness of image in the dft domain , dc is zero frequency content and @xmath7 is the dft coefficient .",
    "since , the dc component in the dft domain has the maximum contribution towards the image brightness , it can be neglected in computation of contrast in dct domain . hence , equation ( [ sch : eq2 ] )",
    "can be modified for the dct domain as : @xmath8    so , instead of computing the spatial frequency , variance or maximum number of high valued ac coefficients in a block using all the transformed ac coefficients , the proposed method adds all of the dct coefficients to measure the contrast of the dct block .",
    "thus computation is drastically reduced and the contribution of individual coefficient is also taken care of .    the schematic block diagram of multi - focus image fusion in dct domain is shown in figure 2(a ) . only the images",
    "a and b are considered for simplicity ; but , the procedure can be applied to fuse more than two source images .",
    "the flow chart of the proposed algorithm is shown in figure 2(b ) .",
    "the blending process comprises the following steps : + 1 .",
    "take the source images a and b , divide these into @xmath9 blocks .",
    "denote the blocks of the two images as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "calculate the dct of the blocks and add the dct coefficients of each of the blocks according to equation ( [ sch : eq3 ] ) and denote the sums as @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "+ 3 . compare @xmath12 and @xmath13 and depending on which of these two is higher , select either a or b. based on the selection prepare the decision map @xmath14 as @xmath15 4.apply consistency verification to mend the visual quality of the output image and use a majority filter to redefine the decision map ; then , construct the dct fused image based on the new decision map as + @xmath16 5.the standardised quantization table is used to quantise the obtained dct coefficients in the jpeg coder and then the output bit stream is entropy coded . + the proposed method compares the absolute amplitude , so , it is named as dct+amp_max in further section .",
    "the block diagram of the proposed multi - focus image fusion ( dct+amp_max ) architecture is shown in figure [ fig : block ] ( a ) .",
    "the proposed architecture uses an @xmath17 dct .",
    "the fused dct coefficients can be further compressed by a jpeg encoder or can be converted back to image by taking inverse dct ( idct ) of the coefficients .",
    "idct architecture is same as the dct architecture with slight changes in coefficients . the block wise description is as follows :    1     1       the presented architecture uses an @xmath17 dct .",
    "it is required to configure memory in such a manner that 8 pixels per clock can be accessed , which is not possible with single memory module .",
    "either we need to choose 4 dual port memory modules or 8 single port memory modules . in this architecture",
    "we have used 8 single port memory modules to get 8 pixels / clock cycle .      since only high frequency ac coefficients of the dct",
    "are required to make the decision for fusion , so , an improved dct with 35 bit ( 1 sign bit , 10 integer bit , 24 fractional bit ) precision is synthesised .",
    "the dct architecture is synthesised using two 1d - dct s with an s - ram based memory transposed architecture @xcite .",
    "the dct architecture is shown in figure [ fig : block ] ( b ) .",
    "the idct architecture is same as the dct architecture .",
    "both the architecture working at same frequency .",
    "the presented architecture can be modified easily for other high speed compression applications .",
    ".5     0.5       this block is used to select one out of two @xmath18 dct blocks",
    ". this block sums up all absolute ac coefficients of each dct block and compares the two sums .",
    "accordingly , it generates an output of zero or one .",
    "simultaneously , it also prepares the decision map for consistency verification .",
    "majority filter is applied on decision map and using newly constructed decision map , the dct coefficient are selected according to equation 7 .",
    "the architecture of majority filter and decision block is shown in figure [ fig : architecture1 ] .",
    "the dct coefficient are required for fusion .",
    "the fifo architecture helps to preserves a dct coefficient till the final selection of the coefficients .",
    "the present fifo is synthesised using s - ram based memory .      based on output of decision block the data select",
    "block selects one set of the dct coefficients out of two sets of dct coefficients and provides the final fused coefficient .",
    "the dct+amp_max method is applied to a set of reference and non - reference images and its performance is evaluated on a standard pc ( intel core i5 processor , 3.10 ghz , 4 gb ram ) .",
    "extensive evaluation is carried out on different images .",
    "some of the images are shown in figure 5 @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we compare the performance of our method with that of the existing image fusion methods in the dct domain , like dct+ac - max , dct+ac - max+cv , dct+variance , dct+variance+cv and dct+sf , dct+sf+cv .    in the first set of experiments ,",
    "the proposed method namely , dct+amp_max is evaluated by fusing 50 pairs of blurred images which are generated using the standard gray scale images shown in figure 5 with an averaging filter .",
    "complementary regions of the images are blurred in every pair of image .",
    "the standard gray scale images are taken as ground truth images .",
