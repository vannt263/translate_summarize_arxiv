    "+ in this paper we will use the heat kernel method for finding the effective potential as described in e.g. the textbook by ramond , @xcite , but this time in curved spacetime using methods developed by the authors @xcite .",
    "we should emphasise that even the simple approach of the first part of this paper can be used to go beyond one - loop order , as we can easily include higher order derivatives of the curvature and of the classical fields corresponding to quantum corrections to the kinetic part of the effective action .",

    "discussion and conclusion",
    "as shown in e.g. ramond @xcite , the effective potential to one - loop order can be found rather quickly by the heat kernel method : @xmath3 where the zeta function is calculated assuming a constant configuration and where @xmath4 denotes the classical field with @xmath5 . in curved space",
    "this must be generalised by determining the heat kernel of the curved space scalar field operator ( from which one can calculate the zeta - function ) , @xmath6 , which thus obeys @xmath7        g(x , x';\\sigma )        = \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\sigma}g(x , x';\\sigma)\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the curved spacetime dalembertian @xmath9 with @xmath10 and where we have introduced vierbeins @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "+ the computation of the coefficients of the heat kernel is rather straightforward .",
    ", only in the final result for the renormalised mass and coupling constant is this assumption needed .",
    "+ one should furthermore notice that although the result quoted here is for @xmath15 we can actually find the heat kernel to arbitrary order of accuracy even for @xmath16 .",
    "the heat kernel would then depend on @xmath17 , the geodesic distance squared , as well as on integrals of powers of the curvature scalar and its derivatives along the geodesic from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , assuming such a curve exists @xcite . ]",
    "the equation to be solved is ( where @xmath20 is found from ( 2 ) ) @xmath21 subject to the boundary condition @xmath22 we solve this equation by writing @xmath23 with @xmath24 the heat kernel of @xmath25 , which in @xmath0 dimensions is @xmath26 with @xmath27 the square of the geodesic distance ( the so - called synge world function ) and @xmath28 being the van vleck - morette determinant . for the present purposes , which simplifies matters a lot . ]",
    "doing this leads to the following equation for @xmath29 @xmath30 subject to the condition @xmath31 taylor expanding @xmath29 , @xmath32 with @xmath33 because of the initial value condition , we get the following recursion relation when @xmath15 @xmath34 from the heat kernel equation it furthermore follows that @xmath35 .",
    "finding the higher coefficients is then trivial , @xcite . + we must emphasise that these coefficients differ from the usual schwinger - dewitt ones , @xcite , a difference due to the different nature of the two expansions used .",
    "+ one should also note that , contrary to the schwinger - dewitt case , the coefficients given by our expansion are relatively straightforward to obtain explicitly . the expression ( 7 )",
    "can actually be viewed as a partial resummation of the schwinger - dewitt series .",
    "in fact , the series is the so - called cumulant of the ( divergent / asymptotic ) series of schwinger and dewitt , which is strictly speaking only valid for @xmath36 small . is a divergent / asymptotic series the _ cumulant _ is given by a series @xmath37 . ]",
    "our series also has better convergence properties due the pressence of an @xmath38-term , which is in itself an indication of an implicit summation of leading log - terms , @xcite .",
    "besides the different expansions used , the major cause for simplification lies in the usage of vierbeins and hence co - moving coordinates .",
    "this being so , it turns out that one can actually rather easily write down expressions for the coefficients in our series , whereas one can in general only compute the first few in the schwinger - dewitt case .",
    "+ thus , we arrive at @xmath39 where @xmath40 with @xmath41 containing vierbeins and their derivatives only @xmath42 in formula ( [ eq : heat0 ] ) higher order terms have been omitted , i.e. , the result is valid for @xmath43 and @xmath44 strong but sufficiently slowly varying in order for us to discard third and higher derivatives . it should be noted that that is the only approximation we have made .",
    "furthermore , one could in principle include higher derivatives  it is not difficult to find the corresponding coefficients  but the integral over @xmath36 which we will ultimately perform becomes difficult to make analytically .",
    "+ with this expression for the heat kernel it is thus possible to calculate the zeta function ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath45 and we finally arrive ( from equations ( 11,14,15,18 ) ) at @xmath46 +             \\frac{1}{64\\pi^2}\\box_0\\left(v''(\\phi_{\\rm cl } )      + \\xi r+{\\cal e}\\right)-\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\frac{1}{96\\pi^2}(m^2+v''(\\phi_{\\rm cl})+\\xi r+{\\cal e})^{-1 }      \\left(\\partial _ p\\left(v''(\\phi_{\\rm cl } )      + \\xi r+{\\cal e}\\right)\\right)^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\xi r\\phi_{\\rm cl}^2\\nonumber\\\\      \\label{eq : veff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath41 appears because we are using vierbeins and hence do not have a coordinate basis , @xmath47\\neq 0 $ ] , and because @xmath25 is not the true dalembertian .",
    "+ notice that this result , ( [ eq : veff ] ) , holds even for @xmath4 not constant .",
    "this means that even though ( 1 ) is only valid to one - loop order",
    "we can get some of the quantum corrections to the kinetic part , which otherwise belong to higher loop order .",
    "of course , we can not expect to get all the corrections this way , but we may get some indication of the nature of the leading terms . + from ( [ eq : veff ] ) we can obtain the renormalised values of the mass and of the coupling constant , putting @xmath48 and assuming , for sake of argument , @xmath49 : @xmath50+\\frac{\\lambda\\xi^2}{32\\pi^2}\\frac{1 }      { m^2+\\xi r+{\\cal e}}-\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\qquad \\frac{\\lambda\\xi^2}{48\\pi^2 }      ( m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e})^{-3}(\\partial_p(\\xi r+{\\cal e}))^2+\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\qquad\\qquad \\frac{\\lambda\\xi}{48\\pi^2}(m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e})^{-2 }      \\partial^p{\\cal e}\\partial_p(\\xi r+{\\cal e})\\\\   m^2_{\\rm ren}&\\equiv&\\left.\\frac{d^2v_{\\rm eff}}{d\\phi_{\\rm cl}^2 }      \\right|_{\\phi_{\\rm cl}=0}-\\xi_{\\rm ren}r\\nonumber\\\\      & = & m^2+\\frac{\\lambda}{32\\pi^2}(m^2 + 2{\\cal e})\\left[\\ln(m^2 +      \\xi r+2{\\cal e})-1\\right]+\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\hspace{20mm}\\frac{\\lambda}{96\\pi^2}(m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e})^{-2 }        ( \\partial_p(\\xi r+{\\cal e}))^2-\\frac{\\lambda\\xi^2}{32\\pi^2}\\frac{1 }      { m^2+\\xi r+{\\cal e}}+\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{20mm}\\frac{\\lambda\\xi^2}{48\\pi^2 }      ( m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e})^{-3}(\\partial_p(\\xi r+{\\cal e}))^2+\\nonumber\\\\      & & \\qquad\\qquad \\frac{\\lambda\\xi}{48\\pi^2}(m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e})^{-2 }      \\partial^p{\\cal e}\\partial_p(\\xi r+{\\cal e})\\\\       \\lambda_{\\rm ren } & \\equiv&\\left.\\frac{d^4v_{\\rm eff}}{d\\phi_{\\rm cl}^4 }      \\right|_{\\phi_{\\rm cl}=0}\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\lambda+\\frac{3\\lambda^2}{32\\pi^2}\\ln(m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e } )      + \\nonumber\\\\      & & \\hspace{30 mm }      \\frac{2\\lambda^2}{48\\pi^2}(m^2+\\xi r+2{\\cal e})^{-3}(\\partial _",

    "consequently , also massless scalar fields will lead to @xmath53 .",
    "such effects may have implications similar to dark matter .",
    "+ let us at this stage pause and compare with the results found by other authors .",
    "hu and oconnor , @xcite , have calculated the effective potential for a @xmath1 theory in a static , homogeneous spacetime in which the interaction term @xmath54 can be assumed constant .",
    "they then use dimensional regularisation and the schwinger - dewitt expansion to find the following expressions for the change in mass and couplings constants to one - loop order : @xmath55 comparing this with our result ( we always take @xmath56 ) we notice that the two set of expressions agree provided we take @xmath57 in hu and oconnor s result , remove the special curvature terms coming from the noncoordinate basis ( i.e. , the @xmath41-terms ) , assuming @xmath58 and ignoring all higher order terms .",
    "the @xmath59-term is easy to understand as it is a constant in their approach , similarly one would expect @xmath43 to be absent in a riemann normal coordinate patch to the lowest order .",
    "as mentioned earlier @xmath41 is a result of not using a coordinate frame in our case , @xmath47\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "+ there is something odd about the result of hu and oconnor , though , the non - minimal coupling , @xmath60 , clearly acts like a mass term in the lagrangian and one would thus expect the renormalised mass to depend on @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , even if the field was massless classically we would expect a curvature induced mass to turn up , but their result is that a massless field does not acquire any mass to one - loop order .",
    "this is in stark contrast to what one would expect in view of shore s work , @xcite , where precisely such a curvature induced mass is responsible for symmetry restoration in scalar qed .",
    "shore s result , which we will also comment on later , is based on an euclidean version of de sitter space , namely @xmath62 , and he then explicitly calculates the zeta function for scalar qed .",
    "in fact , he shows that a minimal coupling would lead to an anomalous mass term .",
    "the discrepancy between the work of hu and oconnor on the one hand and shore and this paper on the other we think rests on the approximations made by the authors of @xcite : a static , homogeneous spacetime using the schwinger - dewitt expansion in a riemann normal coordinate patch .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the method put forward here is a partial resummation of the schwinger - dewitt series and will thus inevitably give different results .",
    "what all these methods agree on , of course , is the result in the flat space limit , where we must recover the coleman - weinberg potential at least as the leading contribution . only keeping the very lowest order terms in ( [ eq : veff ] ) we recover ( except for the quantity @xmath41 ) , the result by hu and oconnor .",
    "+ the effective potential for a @xmath1-theory in some model spacetimes have been calculated by a number of authors .",

    "similarly , berkin @xcite , has found a formula by taylor expanding the heat kernel in powers of @xmath64 .",
    "his result too , is valid only for small @xmath64 .",
    "these two authors agree with each other .",
    "contrary to this , huang @xcite , has used an adiabatic approximation and get a different result .",
    "he finds , for instance , that symmetry restoration ( a point we will be returning to later ) is possible even for @xmath64 large , whereas the other authors only found this to be possible for @xmath64 small .",
    "we will not comment further on these results .",
    "+ ishikawa , @xcite , has calculated the effective potential for a massless @xmath1 , scalar qed theory in a more general background , but using riemann normal coordinates and only going to @xmath65 assuming throughout that @xmath66 .",
    "he uses a renormalisation - group improved technique and gets @xmath67 this differs from our result due to the approximations made ( linearity in @xmath43 , no derivatives of the curvature , no @xmath41-term ) . + in general then , the previous research have mostly been limited to the case @xmath68 , in which case one gets results linear in @xmath43 or the ( slightly improved ) coleman - weinberg potential from flat spacetime with @xmath69 .",
    "contrary to this , we do not require @xmath70 small . for purely practical purposes we have , though , limited ourselves to the regime in which @xmath71 are small ( compared to @xmath43 ) .",

    "only gaussian functional integrals can be calculated in any reliable manner .",

    "an improvement over the previous method can be obtained by writing ( perhaps keeping @xmath4 constant , and in any case only keeping terms @xmath73 when functionally integrating out the fluctuating part @xmath74 ) for part of the interaction term we make the prescription @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the actual mean value of the the field due to the propagation of virtual particles in curved space . ] .",
    "@xmath77 where @xmath78 is a mean field .",

    "the structure of the energy - momentum tensor is important for a number of reasons not only for the possibility of breaking conformal invariance as the conformal anomaly calculated above shows , but also in relation with the various singularity theorems .",
    "the singularity theorems of penrose and hawking and penrose , respectively , rely on the weak and the strong energy conditions , whereas the second law of black hole thermodynamics is based on the non - violation of the null energy condition , and the topological censorship theorem on that of the averaged null condition . and",

    "+ dirac fields differ from scalar fields in that @xmath138 and in an over all factor of @xmath173 ( the minus being due to the grassmannian nature of spinors and the factor two being the number of spin degrees of freedom ) , one should therefore just reverse all signs in order to get a condition for violation of nec for dirac fermions .",

    "it is , more over , the so - called cumulant of the asymptotic series .",
    "furthermore , along the diagonal , our coefficients @xmath88 are given by a very simple recursion relation and thus , once more contrary to the old expansion , they are actually rather easy to find to any order ( only the first 3 or 4 coefficients in the schwinger - dewitt expansion can be found in general ) .",
    "it is even possible to find the coefficients for @xmath16 , though this was not done in this paper .",
    "+ some improvements over the schwinger - dewitt expansion by other authors should be mentioned .",
    "first , the approach of avramidi @xcite , which gives an analytical formula for the remainder of the schwinger - dewitt expansion , making it valid for all @xmath36 .",
    "it is still , however , not as quickly convergent , nor as easy to find the coefficients for as for the expansion of the present paper .",
    "basically the same holds for the non - local partial summation approach of barovinsky et al .",
    "our approach is not in principle limited to one of the two regions @xmath437 and @xmath438 , but the @xmath36-integral becomes difficult to handle in the general case , as no analytical expression for it exists to the best of the present authors knowledge .",
    "this limitation can , however , be overcome in concrete cases by resorting to a numerical calculation . as a final note ,",
    "let us stress that the accuracy of the chosen approach , due to the simple form of the recursion relations , can be systematically improved .",
    "+ we have found curvature induced corrections to the coleman - weinberg potential for scalar fields and the generalisation thereof to dirac and yang - mills fields by means of the heat kernel method . from this",
    "we learned that : + ( 1 ) even when @xmath436 curvature still induces a mass to the fields , so that @xmath439 . in the case of the schwarzschild black hole",
    ", we found the renormalised mass and coupling constant of a scalar field only to differ from the flat space values in the vicinity of the horizon . precisely at the horizon @xmath247",
    ", the renormalised mass was found to be divergent expressing the fact that , seen from an external observer ( schwarzschild coordinates ) an in - falling object never reaches the horizon .",
    "let us also note that these curvature induced corrections to the renormalised mass and coupling constant that can have either sign _ a priori _ , so curvature can both increase and decrease these values .",
    "this latter remark also implies that under certain circumstances an originally massless field can become tachyonic ( i.e. @xmath440 ) , perhaps forcing a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "+ ( 2 ) symmetry breaking occurred also in the yang - mills case explicitly , since we found that the renormalised mass in general was non - zero . even though the classical action is gauge invariant it is well known that the effective action need not be @xcite .",
    "one could take this either as a way of spontaneously breaking symmetries and thus producing masses without the need of a higgs field or perhaps as an indication of the need , in curved backgrounds , of `` entangling '' the internal symmetries with the lorentz transformations , i.e. letting the symmetry group not just be @xmath441 but something more complicated .",
    "lending support to the old hope that the successful quantisation of gravity would entail a unification of all forces .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind , that contributions from the matter fields to the renormalised mass of the gauge boson and those from the curvature can cancel each - other under sufficiently favourable conditions ( symmetry restoration ) .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is of course already present in the mean field approach by putting @xmath442 , a breaking which is induced non - perturbatively by the background curvature .",
    "+ ( 3 ) a very interesting feature is the appearance in @xmath103 of terms which are due to the curvature but survive in the limit @xmath443 .",
    "these terms only appear in @xmath444 , however , provided @xmath445 in this limit .",
    "for the yang - mills field , however , we found that the renormalised coupling contains a manifestly curvature independent non - vanishing term .",
    "+ ( 4 ) in the schwarzschild example the effective action acquires an imaginary part , which therefore implies curvature induced particle production .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the presence of phase transitions ( thought to be responsible for inflation in some scenarios ) will of course be modified by these new terms in the effective potential .",
    "in fact we found that a classical critical point was almost never a critical point of the effective potential . for a classical critical point to `` survive '' the quantisation , both its precise value and the background geometry itself had to satisfy certain extra requirements .",
    "for scalar fields we were able to solve these , while we for yang - mills fields furthermore found restrictions on the structure of the lie algebra .",
    "we also found the critical points of the effective action ( i.e. , quantum critical points ) for scalar fields , and made some comments on fields of higher spin .",
    "it was for instance shown that a yang - mills theory with @xmath353 as its gauge algebra could not have a critical point in a general background .",
    "+ ( 6 ) the resulting renormalised energy - momentum tensor will in general violate the null energy condition ( nec ) for scalar fields , and have non - vanishing trace even for @xmath446 ( conformal anomaly ) . for yang - mills fields nec was",
