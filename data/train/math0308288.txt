    "we do not allow a finite linear space to be `` one - dimensional '' .",
    "of course we could have omitted i3 ( as is done by certain authors ) and then we would only have to change the formulations of certain statements .",

    "a _ proper finite linear space _ is an f.l.s .  with each line passing through at least @xmath15 points .",
    "proper finite linear spaces are important when considering generalizations of the sylvester - gallai theorem ( see section  [ subsec : sg ] ) . a proper f.l.s .",
    "is also called an sg design in @xcite .",
    "our terminology follows recent papers such as @xcite .",
    "a _ blocking set _ of a finite linear space @xmath6 is a subset @xmath16 of @xmath6 such that each line of @xmath6 contains a point of @xmath16 and a point of @xmath17 .",
    "there is extensive literature on blocking sets of block designs ( see @xcite and their references ) , and in particular of affine and projective planes ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  8) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  13 ) , @xcite and their references ) .",
    "not as much has been done on blocking sets for general linear spaces .",
    "cameron @xcite mentions in passing that blocking sets may be studied in general finite linear spaces .",
    "hahn has two papers @xcite on how the existence of certain types of blocking sets in finite linear spaces forces the space to be almost a projective or affine plane .",
    "hoffman , lindner and phelps @xcite and franek , griggs , lindner and rosa @xcite show that a linear space on @xmath18 points with four points on each line that admits a blocking set exists whenever @xmath19 .",
    "batten , coolsaet and street @xcite consider the existence of blocking sets in finite linear spaces where each line passes through either @xmath5 or @xmath20 points .",
    "they show that apart from the above - mentioned cases @xmath19 , such spaces also exist for @xmath21 , and do not exist for all remaining congruence classes , except perhaps @xmath22 , where they conjecture that no such finite linear spaces admit blocking sets . ling @xcite proves that an f.l.s .  with five points on each line that admits a blocking set exists whenever @xmath23 .",
    "see also @xcite for related results .",
    "our main result is a classification of all finite linear spaces of at most @xmath0 points that admit blocking sets .",
    "[ mainthm ]    1 .",
    "no finite linear space on @xmath24 points admits a blocking set .",
    "the punctured projective plane of order @xmath15 is the only f.l.s .  on @xmath2 points with a blocking set .",
    "the projective plane of order @xmath15 is the only f.l.s .  on @xmath3 points with a blocking set .",
    "there are exactly two finite linear spaces on @xmath4 points with blocking sets .",
    "both are subsets of the projective plane of order @xmath20 .",
    "there are exactly five finite linear spaces on @xmath0 points with blocking sets .",
    "all except one are subsets of the projective plane of order @xmath20 , with the exceptional one not embeddable in any desarguesian projective space .",
    "furthermore , all except one are extensions of one of the two @xmath4-point spaces with blocking sets .",
    "it is rather surprising that there are so few finite linear spaces with blocking sets up to @xmath0 points . in all of them",
    "the blocking sets are unique up to complements and automorphisms of the space , with the exception of one of the @xmath0-point spaces which admits two essentially different blocking sets . in section  [ examples ]",
    "we describe the finite linear spaces mentioned in the above theorem and then give a precise formulation of the theorem ( see theorem  [ mainthm2 ] ) .",
    "the proof of the theorem is an extensive case analysis , as is to be expected .",
    "the two main tools used in the proof are the notions of _ minimal _ two - coloured f.l.s .",
    "( see section  [ subsec : def ] ) and of the _ weight _ of a point in a two - coloured f.l.s .  that we introduce below",
    "( see lemma  [ weight ] and the definition preceding it ) .",
    "note that finite linear spaces up to @xmath2 points have been enumerated @xcite , with @xmath3 points still out of reach .",
    "a brute - force computer proof of our result is therefore not yet feasible .",
    "we now give an overview of general results on the existence of blocking sets which we use in the proof of our classification .",
    "it is well known that the projective plane of order @xmath15 has a blocking set ( see example  [ ex : thirteen ] ) .",
    "it is easily seen that the punctured projective plane of order @xmath15 still has a blocking set ( example  [ ex : twelve ] ) .",
    "this is a minimal example : we show that an f.l.s .  on at most @xmath1 points",
    "does not admit a blocking set . more generally , if an f.l.s .",
    "admits a blocking set , the blocking set must have size @xmath25 ( lemma  [ atleastsixpoints ] ) .",
    "also , for each @xmath26 , there exists an f.l.s .",
    "on @xmath18 points admitting a blocking set ( proposition  [ exist ] ) .",
    "an f.l.s .  with a blocking set of @xmath27 points has at most @xmath3 points ( proposition  [ sixpoints ] ) .",
    "it is a folklore result that an f.l.s .  with at most three points on a line",
    "does not admit a blocking set .",
    "thus a necessary condition for an f.l.s .  to admit a blocking set",
    "is that the f.l.s .  has a line with at least @xmath20 points .",
    "a further necessary condition is that there are at least @xmath20 lines passing through _ each _ point ( lemma  [ atleastfourlines ] ) , and more generally , that the f.l.s .",
    "is not the union of @xmath15 lines .",
    "since the complement of a blocking set is also a blocking set , we find it more convenient to formulate our results in terms of @xmath5-colourings .",
    "a _ @xmath5-colouring _ @xmath28 of the finite linear space @xmath6 is a function assigning the colour red or green to each point of @xmath6 . in all the figures we use @xmath29 for red and @xmath30 for green .",
    "a line is _ monochromatic _ if all points incident with it have the same colour .",
    "a _ proper weak _",
    "@xmath5-colouring @xmath28 is a @xmath5-colouring with the property that no line is monochromatic .",
    "mr geometry _",
    "@xmath31 is a properly @xmath5-coloured finite linear space .",
    "thus each colour class of an mr geometry @xmath31 forms a blocking set of the underlying finite linear space @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , any blocking set of @xmath6 determines a proper @xmath5-colouring .",
    "thus an mr geometry is exactly the same as a finite linear space with a blocking set that is singled out .",
    "an _ isomorphism _ between two mr geometries is an isomorphism between the underlying finite linear spaces such that points of the same colour are mapped to points of the same colour .",
    "an mr geometry @xmath32 is a _ one - point extension _ of the mr geometry @xmath31 if @xmath33 is a subset of @xmath34 with one point less than @xmath34 , and the restriction of @xmath35 to @xmath33 is @xmath28 .",
    "note that in the sequel , when we refer to extensions , we will always mean one - point extensions .",
    "an mr geometry @xmath31 is _ minimal _ if it is not a one - point extension of any mr geometry , equivalently , if for all @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is non - collinear , the restriction of @xmath28 to @xmath37 is not a proper 2-colouring of @xmath37 .",
    "thus an mr geometry is minimal if we can not obtain an mr geometry by deleting any single point .",
    "our motivation for finding small mr geometries arose from questions related to the following theorem ( see @xcite or @xcite for a proof ) :    if a finite non - collinear set @xmath33 of points in the real plane affine or projective is @xmath5-coloured , then there exists a line @xmath12 such that @xmath38 has size at least two and is monochromatic .    in the above terminology this theorem asserts that no mr geometry can be embedded into the real projective plane .",
    "it is an open question whether an mr geometry can be embedded into the complex projective plane .",
    "does there exist an mr geometry that can be embedded into the complex projective plane ?",
    "since none of the mr geometries on at most @xmath0 points are embeddable in the projective plane over a division ring of characteristic @xmath39 , we have the following corollary to theorem  [ mainthm ] :    if there exists a finite set @xmath33 of non - collinear points in the projective plane over a division ring of characteristic @xmath39 that can be @xmath5-coloured such that no line determined by two points in @xmath33 is monochromatic , then @xmath33 has size at least @xmath40 .",
    "a theorem closely related to the motzkin - rabin theorem is the sylvester - gallai theorem @xcite :    for any finite non - collinear set @xmath33 of points in the real plane affine or projective there exists a line @xmath12 such that @xmath38 has size two .    in terms of finite linear spaces",
    ", this theorem asserts that no proper finite linear space ( see [ subsec : intro ] ) can be embedded into the real plane .",
    "these two theorems have proofs that are very closely related ( see @xcite ) , leading to the question whether the one implies the other , given some reduced set of axioms .",
    "for example , if one assumes the axioms i1 ,",
    "i2 , i3 and one of the theorems , does the other follow from it ?",
    "first of all it is clear that the motzkin - rabin theorem does not imply the sylvester - gallai theorem , as the fano plane @xmath41 shows .",
    "the converse implication is the following open question :    does an mr geometry always contain a proper linear space as a subspace ?",
    "our classification implies that if the answer to this question is negative , then a counterexample would need at least @xmath40 points . indeed ,",
    "all mr geometries on at most @xmath0 points that are not themselves proper , contain a fano plane .",
    "if there exists an mr geometry that does not contain a proper f.l.s . , then it must have size at least @xmath40",
    ".    for a survey on these and related problems , see @xcite .      in the next section",
    "we give a description of all mr geometries on @xmath0 and fewer points . in section  [ preparations ]",
    "we introduce special notation and prove general properties of mr geometries .",
    "the remainder of the paper contains the proof of the classification . in the proof",
    "we distinguish between minimal and non - minimal mr geometries .",
    "the non - minimal geometries on @xmath42 points may be generated by extending the mr geometries on @xmath43 points .",
    "the results are indicated in the next section with proofs in the appendix .",
    "it then remains to enumerate the minimal mr geometries . since in section  [ preparations ]",
    "it is shown that there is no mr geometry on @xmath44 points , an mr geometry on @xmath2 points must be minimal . in section  [ twelvethirteen ] we show that there is a unique minimal mr geometry on @xmath2 points ( the punctured projective plane of order @xmath15 ) , and that there is no minimal mr geometry on @xmath3 points . in section  [ sec : fourteen ] we show that there are only two minimal mr geometries on @xmath4 points , and in section  [ fifteen ] that there is only one minimal mr geometry on @xmath0 points , thus completing the proof of the classification ( theorems  [ mainthm ] and [ mainthm2 ] ) .",

    "colour all points on @xmath60 and @xmath61 green , except for @xmath62 and @xmath63 which we colour red , and colour all the points on @xmath64 and @xmath65 red except for @xmath66 and @xmath67 which we colour green .",
    "we then already have that any line of @xmath56 passes through a green and a red point , except for the line @xmath68 which does not pass through a green point , and @xmath69 which does not pass through a red point .",

    "this is possible if @xmath74 .",
    "we now have a properly @xmath5-coloured subset of @xmath75 points of @xmath56 with the property that every line of @xmath56 already passes through a green and a red point .",
    "we may add points and colour them arbitrarily and still have an mr geometry .",
