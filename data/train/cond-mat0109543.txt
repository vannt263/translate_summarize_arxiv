    "the richness of the phase diagram of the ruddlesden - popper series of the ruthenates makes it a fascinating topics of current solid state physics .",
    "indeed single - layered ruthenates can be a superconductor ( sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) as discovered by maeno _",
    "et al._@xcite or an anti - ferromagnetic insulator ( ca@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) , while multi - layered compounds may be ferromagnetic metals ( srruo@xmath2 and possibly sr@xmath2ru@xmath0o@xmath3 ) or an anti - ferromagnetic metal ( caruo@xmath2 ) .",
    "this richness is particularly amazing when one observes that all these compounds are , from a theoretical point of view , remarkably similar .",
    "indeed ca and sr are divalent cations , the electron - electron interaction is strongest on the ru atoms , which are common to all compounds , and the lattice structure does not drastically change when scanning through this family .",
    "nevertheless these small changes must be responsible for the variety of the ground states .",
    "this thus calls for an accurate description of the electronic band structure , for instance on the level of the tight binding approximation .",
    "note that ca@xmath4ruo@xmath5 appears to be a mott insulator below 300 k. indeed , transport@xcite and optical@xcite measurements reveal a narrow gap of about 0.2 ev .",
    "it orders magnetically below @xmath6100 k , and therefore the insulating state may not be attributed to the magnetic ordering .",
    "another striking feature is provided by la doping ( or other trivalent cations ) of both sr- and ca - based single layered compounds : in both cases a few percent doping turns these systems into ferromagnets@xcite . for the ca - based compound ,",
    "the curie temperature is about 100 k , while substitutions of ca with other trivalent dopants , such as y , ce or pr result in ferromagnetic states with curie temperatures varying from 120 to 200 k@xcite . for the sr - based compound , la substitution results into a ferromagnetic state , with a curie temperature of 40 k at a concentration of 4 percent of dopant@xcite .    instead of investigating the nature and the cause of the superconductivity in sr@xmath4ruo@xmath5 , which is still a controversial matter@xcite , we rather concentrate on the fermi liquid parameters and the magnetic structure of the entire series .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first introduce a model meant to capture the main feature of this series on a minimal model level .",
    "it includes the details of the band structure , inspired by a proposition from noce and cuoco@xcite which is compatible with the experimentally determined fermi surface@xcite and spectroscopic data@xcite . with minimal changes",
    "it can be applied to other perovskites such as vanadates and chromites .",
    "secondly we explain how we are dealing with the strong coulomb and hund s rule couplings .",
    "thirdly we present numerical results pointing towards a picture where both ca- , and sr - based ruthenates derive from a mott insulator . the former system appears to be a mott insulator at commensurate filling , while the second one should rather be seen as a self - doped mott insulator .",
    "this is due to a partial filling of all sub - bands .",
    "the band structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has been determined in the lda by oguchi@xcite and singh@xcite . later on it turned out that it can accurately be reproduced by a simple tight binding model by noce and cuoco@xcite .",
    "the bands which are crossing the fermi energy are involving the three 4d t@xmath7 orbitals of ru , which are hybridizing with the 2p orbitals of o. they are filled with 16 electrons per ruo@xmath0 unit . since the ruo@xmath8 octahedra are elongated along the z - direction , the d@xmath9 orbital energy level is lying lower than the other two . from the lda calculation , the corresponding band is nearly filled . in the following it will be neglected , except for possibly contributing to self - doping effects .",
    "the d@xmath10 orbitals hybridize only with the p@xmath11 orbital of the neighboring o along the z - axis , and with the p@xmath12 orbital along the x ( y)-axis . on top , the latter two orbitals weakly couple to one another as well .",
    "it numerically turns out that the dispersion in the z - direction is small , and will therefore be neglected .",
    "the resulting dispersions are given by the eigenvalues of : @xmath13 with @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 represents the lattice constant ( the ru - ru distance ) .",
    "it is from now on set to unity .",
    "the lda dispersions is best reproduced with the parameter set @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "integrating out the oxygen bands , and neglecting their frequency dependence , yields the effective model : @xmath24 \\tilde{a}_{k } & \\tilde{f}_{k } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } \\right ) \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } d_{xz,\\sigma}\\\\d_{yz,\\sigma } \\end{array } \\right)\\ , , \\ ] ] up to a constant energy shift .",
    "here we introduced : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the effective hoppings @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related to the original parameters by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . note that the two - dimensional character of the dispersions @xmath32 with @xmath33 , purely follows from the off - diagonal terms .",
    "these two eigenvalues yield the dispersion one obtains in lda calculation@xcite .",
    "the resulting density of states is symmetrical with respect to half band filling , where it has a minimum .",
    "the band width @xmath34 is 1.2  ev .",
    "we have modeled the coulomb interaction using a hubbard @xmath35-term and hund s rule coupling term @xmath36-terms , yielding the local hamiltonian : @xmath37 & + & u_1\\sum_{i,\\rho'\\neq\\rho}n_{i,\\rho,\\uparrow}n_{i,\\rho',\\downarrow } + u_3 \\sum_{i,\\rho } n_{i,\\rho,\\uparrow}n_{i,\\rho,\\downarrow}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is a spin ( band ) index .",
    "the relation between the coefficients @xmath40 holds for perfect cubic symmetry@xcite , otherwise one should work with the matrix elements @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43@xcite . in the following we nevertheless stick to the minimal model using the relation eq .",
    "( [ hund ] ) .",
    "this amounts to deal with the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( with @xmath28 setting the energy scale ) . since the ruthenates ( sr@xmath44ca@xmath45)@xmath4ruo@xmath5 may be mott insulators ( depending on the value of @xmath46 )",
    ", perturbative calculations may be problematic .",
    "here we resort to a slave boson approach@xcite , which is the generalization of the kotliar and ruckenstein representation of the hubbard model@xcite , to the multi - band model . at this stage one",
    "may wish to introduce a rotation invariant formulation in the spirit of li _ et al . _ or frsard and wlfle s representations@xcite . in the one - band model ,",
    "such a representation turned out to be necessary to obtain the correct contribution of the spin fluctuations to the specific heat on the one - loop level@xcite .",
    "it also appeared very useful when investigate incommensurate states@xcite . in the systems under consideration ,",
    "perfect cubic symmetry is absent , and therefore rotational symmetry in spin space is not a requirement .",
    "thus the local model eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) can be viewed as a model in its own right , despite of lacking rotational invariance .",
    "note that the tightly related gutzwiller approximation has been suitably generalized to deal with rotationally symmetrical models@xcite .",
    "manifestly anti - ferromagnetic solutions are playing a role as well , as discussed by hasegawa@xcite .",
    "this is however a less puzzling issue than the occurrence of ferromagnetism , and is therefore not investigated here . since there is no van hove singularity at half - filling , we expect that an anti - ferromagnetic instability can only occur above a finite ( and substantial ) @xmath35 , as it happens in the @xmath47 model@xcite or in the one band model on the hexagonal lattice@xcite .",
    "recently hasegawa@xcite showed that orbitally ordered states in this model seem to rather appear for negative @xmath36",
