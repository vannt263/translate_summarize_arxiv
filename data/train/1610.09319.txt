    "consider a small ( compact ) body of mass @xmath0 ( with @xmath10 ) moving freely in an asymptotically flat background spacetime ( e.g. , kerr spacetime ) of mass  @xmath2 .",
    "this system emits gravitational radiation , and there is a corresponding radiation - reaction influence on the small body s motion .",
    "self - consistently calculating this motion and the emitted gravitational radiation ( and in general , the perturbed spacetime ) is a long - standing research question in general relativity .",
    "there is also an astrophysical motivation for this calculation : if a neutron star or stellar - mass black hole of mass  @xmath11@xmath12 orbits a massive black hole of mass  @xmath13@xmath14 , denotes the solar mass . ]",
    "the resulting `` extreme  mass - ratio inspiral '' ( emri ) system is expected to be a strong astrophysical gravitational - wave ( gw ) source detectable by the planned elisa space - based gravitational - wave detector .",
    "elisa is expected to observe many such systems , some of them at quite high signal / noise ratios ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data analysis for , and indeed the detection of , such systems will generally require matched - filtering the detector data stream against appropriate precomputed gw templates .",
    "the problem of computing such templates provides the astrophysical motivation for our calculation .",
    "we are particularly concerned with the case where the small body s orbit is highly relativistic , so post - newtonian methods ( see , for example ,  @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) are not reliably accurate . since the timescale for radiation reaction to shrink the orbit is very long ( @xmath15 )",
    "while the required resolution near the small body is very high ( @xmath16 ) , a direct `` numerical relativity '' integration of the einstein equations ( see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein ) would be prohibitively expensive ( and probably insufficiently accurate ) for this problem .",
    "( @xmath17 ) , ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however , it has not ( yet ) been possible to extend these results to the extreme - mass - ratio case nor to accurately evolve even the  @xmath18 case for a radiation - reaction time scale . ] instead , we use black hole perturbation theory , treating the small body as an @xmath4  perturbation on the background spacetime . for this work",
    "we attempt to calculate leading - order radiation - reaction effects , i.e. , @xmath4  field perturbations and @xmath3  radiation - reaction `` self - forces '' acting on the small body . because of the technical difficulty of controlling gauge effects in gravitational perturbations , in this work we use a scalar - field `` toy model '' system with the expectation that the techniques developed and discoveries made in the scalar case will carry over to the gravitational case .",
    "the obvious way to model the small body is as a small black hole . while conceptually elegant , this approach is technically somewhat complicated  @xcite .",
    "instead , we model the small body as a point particle .",
    "although one may be concerned about potential foundational issues with this approach ,- function stress - energy tensors .",
    "more general colombeau - algebra methods may be able to resolve this problem  @xcite , but the precise meaning of the phrase `` point particle '' in general relativity remains a delicate question . ] in practice it works well and , importantly , it agrees with rigorous derivations that do not rely on the use of point particles .",
    "the @xmath4 `` misataquwa '' equations of motion for a gravitational point particle in a ( strong - field ) curved spacetime were first derived by mino , sasaki , and tanaka  @xcite and quinn and wald  @xcite ( also see detweiler s analysis  @xcite ) and have recently been rederived in a more rigorous manner by gralla and wald  @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for general reviews of gravitational radiation - reaction dynamics .",
    "the particle s motion may be modelled as either ( i ) non - geodesic motion in the background schwarzschild / kerr spacetime under the influence of a radiation - reaction `` self - force '' , or ( ii ) geodesic motion in a perturbed spacetime .",
    "these two perspectives ( which are in some ways analogous to eulerian versus lagrangian formulations of fluid dynamics ) are equivalent  @xcite ; in this work we use the formulation  ( i ) .",
    "the misataquwa equations then give the self - force in terms of ( the gradient of ) the metric perturbation due to the particle , which must be computed using black - hole perturbation theory .",
    "the computation of the field perturbation due to a point particle is particularly difficult because the `` perturbation '' is formally infinite at the particle and thus must be regularized .",
    "there are several different , but equivalent regularization schemes known for this problem , notably the `` mode - sum '' scheme developed by barack and ori  @xcite , detweiler , messaritaki , and whiting  @xcite , and haas and poisson  @xcite ; the green - function approach  @xcite , and the `` effective - source '' scheme of barack and golbourn  @xcite and vega and detweiler  @xcite . for a summary of computational schemes ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in this work we use the effective - source regularization scheme .",
    "as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sect : theory / effective - src ] , this scheme s basic concept is to analytically compute a `` puncture field '' which approximates the particle s detweiler - whiting singular field  @xcite , then numerically solve for the difference between the actual field perturbation and the puncture field .",
    "we have previously described many of the details of the computation of the puncture field  @xcite ; in this work we focus on the application of this scheme to a particular class of self - force computations .",
    "depending on how the partial differential equations ( pdes ) are solved , there are two broad classes of self - force computations : frequency - domain and time - domain .",
    "frequency - domain computations involve a fourier transform of the pdes in time , reducing the numerical computation to the solution of a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting computations are typically very efficient and accurate for circular or near - circular particle orbits , , and heffernan , ottewill , and wardell  @xcite ( building on earlier work by detweiler , messaritaki , and whiting  @xcite ) have extended this to a few parts in @xmath19 .",
    "johnson - mcdaniel , shah , and whiting  @xcite describe an `` experimental mathematics '' approach to computing post - newtonian expansions of various invariants ( again for circular geodesic orbits in schwarzschild spacetime ) by applying an integer - relation algorithm to numerical results calculated using up to @xmath20  decimal digits of precision . ] but degrade rapidly in efficiency with increasing eccentricity of the particle s orbit , becoming impractical for highly eccentric orbits  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , time - domain computations involve a direct numerical time - integration of the pdes and are generally less efficient and accurate than frequency - domain computations .",
    "however , time - domain computations can accommodate arbitrary particle orbits with only modest penalties in performance and accuracy @xcite , with some complications in the numerical schemes ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "our goal is to consider highly eccentric orbits , .",
    "_ intermediate_mass - ratio - inspirals ( where the small body has a mass @xmath21 ) are likely to have very high eccentricities @xmath22 ; these systems are likely much rarer than emris , but are also much stronger gw sources .",
    "] , so we follow the time - domain approach .",
    "we use standard berger - oliger mesh refinement techniques and compactified hyperboloidal slices for improved accuracy and efficiency .",

    "in contrast ( as noted in section  [ sect - discussion / possible - improvements / efficiency ] ) , with the classical rk4  scheme 50% of evaluations are repeated in this way , so  since the effective source computation dominates the code s overall running time  there is an easy factor - of - two saving in computational cost by caching and reusing the effective source from one evaluation to the next if the evaluation time is unchanged .",
