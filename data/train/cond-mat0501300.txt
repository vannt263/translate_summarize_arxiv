    "the local crystallographic structure around impurities is unknown in most cases , although it is an essential piece of information to undestand their influence on the physical properties of the host and to carry out _ ab initio _ simulations of these materials .",
    "this situation is due to the experimental and theoretical difficulties that are met to obtain microscopic information on impurity systems . from the theoretical point of view , quantum calculations of impurity systems require the use of large supercells that have long not been computationally manageable . from the experimental point of view , impurity systems can only be measured with methods which can selectively probe certain atomic species . among such methods ,",
    "many of them , such as electronic paramagnetic resonance , give only indirect information on the position and nature of the atoms surrounding the impurity .",
    "due to the advent of third - generation synchrotron radiation facilities , x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) is now able to investigate impurities in solids .",
    "the extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) region of a xas spectrum provides quantitative information about the short range organization around the absorbing atom ( coordination number , interatomic distances ) . the x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) region usually gives qualitative information about the atomic arrangement up to the medium range order .",
    "xanes is sensitive to the electronic structure ( bonding ) and probes the empty states of solids . in the case of dilute elements in single crystals , especially at the @xmath3 edge of 3@xmath4 transition elements , collecting exafs spectra with a good signal - to - noise ratio",
    "is a difficult task , because the intensity of diffraction peaks becomes much larger than the exafs signal .",
    "taking the example of impurities in corundum , @xcite good exafs spectra could be collected for 10000 wt.ppm cr@xmath5 impurities , but the usable energy range obtained for 1500 wt.ppm fe@xmath5 impurities was already quite limited , and the concentration of coloring impurities is often an order of magnitude lower than this . in such cases , xanes becomes a practicle and precious technique to get information about the local structure of the absorbing atom.@xcite however , the analyzis of the experimental xanes data is not straightforward because of the photoelectron multiple - scattering processes that occur in the near - edge region . _",
    "ab initio _ xanes simulations are then required to relate the experimental spectral features to the local geometry around the aborbing atom .",
    "recently , an efficient first - principle approach based on plane - wave pseudopotential formalism has been developed to calculate @xmath3-edge xanes spectra.@xcite here we apply this method to the @xmath3-edge of substitutional paramagnetic impurities in aluminum oxide .",
    "more precisely , we investigate the structural modifications of the corundum crystal structure induced by the presence of substitutional ti@xmath5 , cr@xmath5 or fe@xmath5 . this system is chosen because corundum containing transition metal impurities is important for laser applications and as gemstones .",
    "colorless corundum ( ) becomes red ruby , pink sapphire , or yellow sapphire when a small amount of cr@xmath5 , ti@xmath5 , or fe@xmath5 ions substitute for al@xmath5 ions , respectively.@xcite the color of blue sapphire is due to the presence of ( fe - ti ) pairs in .    for this investigation ,",
    "polarized xanes spectra are measured and calculated .",
    "corundum belongs to the trigonal bravais lattice , the optical axis being parallel to the [ 111 ] direction of the trigonal unit cell ( i.e. to the @xmath6-axis of the hexagonal cell ) .",
    "corundum is then a dichroic compound in the electric dipole approximation .",
    "the dichroic signal is a direct signature of the departure of the impurity site from octahedral symmetry.@xcite xanes calculations are performed from structural models resulting from _ ab initio _ energy minimization calculations .",
    "the agreement of our experimental and theoretical spectra demonstrates that precise structural information can be extracted from the anglular - dependent xanes spectra , provided the electronic potential is accurately modelled .",

    "one observes that the experimental spectra present comparable overall shapes .",
    "the fe @xmath3 edge seems to be less resolved than the ti and cr @xmath3 edges , probably due to the following two reasons : ( i ) the core - hole lifetime is shorter at the fe @xmath3-edge ( 1.25  ev ) than at the cr @xmath3-edge ( 1.08  ev ) and at the ti @xmath3-edge ( 0.94  ev);@xcite ( ii ) the instrumental resolution is estimated to 0.9  ev at the fe @xmath3-edge while it is 0.6 - 0.7  ev at both the cr and ti @xmath3-edges .",
