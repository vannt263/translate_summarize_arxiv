    "in the current star formation paradigm , low - mass stars grow in mass over time through accretion of matter from a circumstellar disc ( e.g. lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; appenzeller & mundt 1989 ; bertout 1989 ) .",
    "this accretion process is believed to occur via the magnetic field lines that connect the star to its disc and that act as funnels for the gas ( e.g. knigl 1991 ; shu et al .",
    "the strong excess emission observed in most of these pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars is believed to originate through gravitational energy , released by infalling matter , that ionises and excites the gas .",
    "thus , the excess luminosity of these objects ( the classical t tauri stars ) can be used to measure the mass accretion rate .",
    "a reliable measurement of the rate of mass accretion onto pms stars is of paramount importance for understanding the evolution of both the stars and their discs ( see e.g. review by calvet et al .",
    "2000 ) . of particular interest",
    "is determining how the mass accretion rate changes with time as a star approaches its main sequence , whether it depends on the final mass of the forming star and whether it is affected by the chemical composition and density of its parent molecular cloud or by the proximity of hot , massive stars .",
    "ground - based spectroscopic studies of nearby young star - forming regions ( e.g. in taurus , auriga , ophiuchus , orion ) show that the mass accretion rate appears to decrease steadily with time , from @xmath16m@xmath13yr@xmath14 at ages of @xmath17myr to @xmath18m@xmath13yr@xmath14 at @xmath19myr ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2000 ; sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "2005 ; 2006 ) . while at face value this is in line with the expected evolution of viscous discs ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) , the scatter on the data is very large , exceeding 2  dex at any given age .",
    "this is at least in part explained by the recent finding that the mass accretion rate seems also to depend quite steeply on the mass of the forming star .",
    "muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2003 ; 2005 ) , natta et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2006 ) , white & hillenbrand ( 2004 ) and sicilia - aguilar et al . ( 2006 ) consistently report that the accretion rate @xmath6 decreases with the stellar mass @xmath20 as @xmath21 , albeit with large uncertainties on the actual value of the power - law index . on the other hand ,",
    "clarke & pringle ( 2006 ) warn that such a steep decline might be spurious and strongly driven by detection / selection thresholds .",
    "while observational uncertainties and potential systematic errors may well contribute to the present uncertainty , the true limitation in this field of research currently comes from the paucity of available measurements .",
    "indeed , all the results so far obtained are based on the mass accretion rates of a small number of stars ( just over one hundred ) , all located in nearby galactic star forming regions , covering a very limited range of ages and no appreciable range of metallicity ( all clouds mentioned above having essentially solar metallicity ; e.g. padgett 1996 ) .",
    "the origin of this limitation is to be found in the technique used to measure pms mass accretion rates .",
    "regardless as to whether the latter are derived from the analysis of veiling in the photosperic absorption lines ( usually at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths ) or through a detailed study of the profile and intensity of emission lines ( usually h@xmath3 , pa@xmath22 or br@xmath23 ) , these thechniques typically require medium to high resolution spectroscopy for each individual object .",
    "even with modern multi - object spectrographs at the largest ground - based telescopes , this approach is not very efficient and can not reach beyond nearby star forming regions or the orion cluster , as crowding and sensitivity issues rule out but the brightest objects in more distant regions like the centre of the milky way or the magellanic clouds .",
    "while in principle the pms mass accretion rate can be estimated from the @xmath15-band excess if the spectral type is known ( see e.g. gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ; romaniello et al .",
    "2004 ) , this method is potentially subject to large uncertainties in the extinction and in the determination of the correct spectral type and effective temperature when spectroscopy is not available .    in order to overcome these limitations and",
    "significantly extend the sample of stars with a measured mass accretion rate , we have developed and successfully tested a new method to reliably measure @xmath24 that does not require spectroscopy .",
    "the method , described in the following sections , combines broad - band @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry with narrow - band @xmath2 imaging and allows us to identify all stars with excess h@xmath3 emission and to derive from it the accretion luminosity @xmath25 and hence @xmath6 for hundreds of objects simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section2 we address the identification of pms stars via their colour excess and in section3 we show how to reliably convert the measured excess into h@xmath3 luminosity and equivalent width .",
    "section4 shows how the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate can be obtained from the h@xmath3 luminosity and section5 presents an application of the method to the field of sn1987a , in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "a thorough discussion of all systematic uncertainties involved in the method is provided in section6 , while a general discussion and conclusions follow in section7 .",
    "the appendix provides additional figures and tabular material .",
    "one of the characteristic signatures of the accretion process on to pms stars is the presence of excess emission in h@xmath3 ( see calvet et al .",
    "although surveys to search for stars with h@xmath3 excess emission over large sky areas have been traditionally carried out via slitless spectroscopy ( e.g. herbig 1957 ; kohoutek & wehmeyer 1999 ) , extensive studies in which narrow - band h@xmath3 imaging is combined with broad - band photometry also exist ( e.g. parker et al . 2005 ; drew et al .",

    "( 1998 ) , panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and romaniello et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used hst / wfpc2 photometry in h@xmath3 ( f656n ) and the r band ( f675w ) to provide the first direct detection of extra - galactic pms stars with strong h@xmath3 emission in the lmc .",
    "their approach is based on the widely adopted use of the r band magnitude as an indicator of the level of the photospheric continuum near the h@xmath3 line .",
    "therefore , stars with strong h@xmath3 emission will have a large @xmath26 colour . from the analysis of the specific f656n and f675w filter response curves of the wfpc2 instrument , panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conclude that an equivalent width ( @xmath27 ) of the h@xmath3 emission line in excess of 8 will result in a colour excess @xmath28 .",
    "this way of identifying pms stars is more accurate and reliable than the simple classification based on the position of the objects in the hertzsprung  russell diagram , i.e. stars placed well above the main sequence ( e.g. gilmozzi et al .",
    "1994 ; hunter et al . 1995 ; nota et al .",
    "2006 ; gouliermis et al .",
    "the reason is twofold : _",
    "( i ) _ contamination by older field stars and the effects of differential extinction may lead to an overestimate of the actual number of candidate young , low - mass pms stars , i.e. those `` above '' the ms ; _ ( ii ) _ older pms stars , already close to their ms , can not be properly identified with this method , thereby resulting in an underestimate of the number of stars that are still forming .",
    "when pms stars are identified by means of their @xmath26 colour excess , both problems disappear .    similarly , this approach is more practical , efficient and economical than slitless spectroscopy for studying pms stars in dense star forming regions in the milky way and nearby galaxies , which are today accessible thanks to high - resolution observations , in particular those made with the hst",
    ".    we will show in section3 that the level of the photospheric continuum near h@xmath3 can be directly derived from the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "this means that pms stars with an h@xmath3 excess can be identified without actually measuring the canonical @xmath26 index . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath26 has traditionally been used in pms stars studies , we first show here how one can derive analytically the @xmath29 magnitude of an object from the measured @xmath0 and i magnitudes .",
    "in this way , we intend to make it possible for those who do not dispose of r - band photometry for their fields to derive it in an accurate way by using measurements in the neighbouring v and i bands .",
    "the latter are more commonly used than the r band in photometric studies of resolved stellar populations and are particularly popular among hst observers .",
    "the absence of remarkable spectral features between 5000 and 9000 in the stellar continuum of dwarfs and giants with effective temperatures in the range 4000k @xmath30 10000k implies that their @xmath31 and @xmath32 colours depend primarily on the effective temperature of the stars and less on their metallicity . in effect , @xmath32 remains a useful colour index for temperature determinations ( von braun et al .",
    "1998 ; bessell , castelli & plez 1998 ) .",
    "the colour  colour sequences in the @xmath33 passbands published by johnson ( 1966 ) revealed a very tight correlation between the mean @xmath31 and @xmath32 colours of local dwarfs and giants ( see figure[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the correlation is remarkably linear in the range @xmath34 ( i.e. 4000k @xmath35 10000k ) , where @xmath36 ( dashed line in figure[fig1 ] ) , and it remains linear for @xmath37 ( i.e. 3000k @xmath38 4000k ) , albeit with a shallower slope ( @xmath39 ; dot - dashed line ) .",
    "it is , therefore , possible and meaningful to attempt to derive the value of the @xmath29 magnitude from the knowledge of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , particularly because no extrapolation beyond the available wavelength range is involved .",
    "the simple inversion of the relationship above gives @xmath40 for the system of johnson .",
    "is not the same as the much more commonly used cousin s @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the colour relationships given here can not be used for the cousin system .",
    "proper relationships for the most common magnitude systems are provided in the appendix . ]",
    "interestingly , this relationship is very similar to the one that we would obtain if we assumed that the proportion with which the @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes contribute to the @xmath29 magnitude is simply dictated by the ratio of the effective wavelengths of the filters .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the v , r and i bands in johnson s system are , respectively , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which imply that the v band should contribute for @xmath44 and the i band for @xmath45 to the r - band magnitude .",
    "these values are remarkably close to those observed .    the apparent disarming simplicity of this conclusion , however , should not lead one to think that this is the case for any photometric system .",
    "in particular , for spectral bands much wider than johnson s , such as some of the hst / wfpc2 and hst / acs filters , the matter becomes more complicated because the true effective wavelength can depend significantly on the spectral properties of the source ( i.e. its temperature ) . in these cases ,",
    "the relationship should be derived via direct observations in the specific bands or through synthetic photometry , when the properties of the photometric system are well caracterised .    due to the large number of inter - related observing modes offered by the scientific instruments on board the hst , synthetic photometry has long been established as the most practical and efficient approach to their calibration ( see koornneef et al .",
    "1986 ; horne 1988 ; sirianni et al .",
    "for this reason , reference tables exist that accurately describe the main optical components of the telescope and instruments as well as the response and quantum efficiency of the detectors as a function of wavelength .",
    "therefore , thanks also to the availability of standardised software packages ( e.g. synphot ; see laidler et al . 2008 ) , it is relatively easy to derive synthetic magnitudes from observed or theoretical stellar spectra for various hst instrumental configurations .",
    "we have used both observed and theoretical stellar spectra , taken respectively from the bruzual - persson - gunn - stryker ( bpgs ) spectrophotometry atlas ( see gunn & stryker 1983 ) and from the stellar atmosphere models of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , to compute colour relationships between @xmath29-like magnitudes and @xmath32-like colours for various hst instruments and ground photometric systems .",
    "details on how the colour transformations were derived and a table of coefficients ( table[tab3 ] ) can be found in the appendix , while a brief comparison with hst data is given in the following section .",
    "to verify the validity of the predicted colour relationships , we have used wfpc2 photometry of a field around sn1987a studied by romaniello ( 1998 ) , panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and romaniello et al .",
    "the observations cover a field of @xmath8arcmin@xmath9 and were collected over three epochs , namely 1994 september , 1996 february and 1997 july .",
    "the advantage of this catalogue is that the magnitude of each star in it is individually corrected for the effects of interstellar extinction by using the information provided simultaneously by all broad - band filters ( see romaniello et al .",
    "2002 for more details ) .",
    "while it would be possible to include the effects of reddening in the calculations of the colour relationships of table[tab3 ] , it is more appropriate in this case to correct the observed magnitudes , since considerable differential extinction is likely to be present in this field ( see panagia et al . 2000 ; de marchi & panagia , in preparation ) .    from the catalogue of romaniello et al . (",
    "2002 ) , we have selected all those stars whose mean error @xmath46 in the three bands f555w , f675w and f814w does not exceed @xmath47mag , where    @xmath48    and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the photometric uncertainties in each individual band after correction for interstellar extinction .",
    "a total of @xmath52 stars satisfy the condition set by equation[eq1 ] , out of @xmath53 objects in the complete catalogue .",
    "the colour  colour diagram for the stars selected in this way is shown in figure[fig2 ] .",
    "the dashed line in that figure corresponds to the colour relationship derived for the bands in question from the models of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see the appendix ) and is practically indistinguishable from the best linear regression fit to the data , which has a slope of @xmath54 .",
    "although these models were selected to match the metallicity of the lmc , having used the relationship derived with the bpgs atlas or that for @xmath55=-1 $ ] would have still resulted in a very good fit , within the observational uncertainties .",
    "this result confirms that , at least over the range explored here , metallicity does not play a dominant role in the colour relationships .",
    "we provide a further proof of the reliability and accuracy of the interpolated r - band magnitudes in figure[fig3 ] , where we compare the identification of pms stars based on the measured and interpolated @xmath26 colour . to distinguish the",
    "observed from interpolated r - band magnitude , we indicate the latter with @xmath56 , as explained below . ,",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to indicate the respective wfpc2 bands .",
    "when differences between photometric systems are important ( e.g. in table[tab3 ] ) , all bands will be indicated with their specific name . ] in this case , from the photometry of romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) already corrected for reddening , we have further restricted the selection to objects with @xmath57 , comprising @xmath58 stars .",
    "diamonds in figure[fig3 ] represent the average @xmath26 colour of the population and , as such , define the reference with respect to which one should look for excess emission .",
    "the dashed lines represent the theoretical colour relationship obtained using the bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model atmospheres mentioned above for normal main - sequence stars and is in rather good agreement with the average observed colours in the range @xmath59 ( filled diamonds ) .",
    "the rms deviation between the model and the data over this range amounts to @xmath60mag and is dominated by the systematic departure in the range @xmath61 .",
    "the latter could be due to a number of reasons , including the inability of the models to accurately describe the properties of the h@xmath3 line since they are meant to be used for broad - band photometry .",
    "the departure of the models from the data at @xmath62 stems from both small number statistics and the fact that the bulk of the population there comes from red giants , which have lower surface gravity and possibly lower metallicity than those assumed in the models . in the following",
    ", we will concentrate our analysis to the range @xmath63 marked by the filled diamonds .",
    "figure[fig3]a is based on the observed data and we indicate as large dots all stars whose observed @xmath26 colour exceeds the local average by at least four times the individual photometric uncertainty in the colour , i.e. the one specific to each star . consequently , these objects must be regarded as having a bona - fide h@xmath3 excess above the @xmath10 level .",
    "there are 199 such objects in panel ( a ) . in panel",
    "( b ) we have replaced the observed @xmath29 magnitude with its interpolated value @xmath56 .",
    "all but 16 of the 199 stars with @xmath10 excess in panel ( a ) have a @xmath10 excess also in panel ( b ) and are indicated as large dots .",
    "the remaining 16 objects , marked as triangles , fail this requirement as their colour is closer to the local average colour than four times their specific combined photometric uncertainty .",
    "in panels ( c ) and ( d ) we study the uncertainty in the other direction , i.e. from the interpolated to the observed plane .",
    "panel ( c ) simulates the case in which , no @xmath29-band data being available , one uses the interpolated @xmath56 value from table[tab3 ] to identify stars with h@xmath3 excess emission .",
    "stars indicated as large dots in panel ( c ) are those with interpolated @xmath64 colour exceeding the local average by at least four times the individual photometric uncertainty in the colour , i.e. those with h@xmath3 excess above the @xmath10 level .",
    "a total of 194 stars meet this condition .",
    "all but 11 of them would have met the @xmath10 excess condition if we had used the actually observed @xmath29-band magnitude .",
    "they are indicated as tlarge dots in panel ( d ) , while the 11 objects failing the condition are marked as triangles .    from figure[fig3 ]",
    "we can draw some quantitative conclusions on the statistical significance of the detection of the colour excess in h@xmath3 .",
    "first of all , it does not surprise that some objects detected as bona - fide h@xmath3 excess stars in panel ( a ) are rejected in panel ( b ) , since the typical photometric uncertainty on @xmath56 is a factor of @xmath65 higher than that on @xmath29 , as one must combine the uncertainties on @xmath0 and @xmath1 that concur to the estimate of @xmath56 ( although the major contribution to the uncertainty on the @xmath26 colour of a star comes from the h@xmath3 band ) .",
    "for the same reason , it is to be expected that panel ( c ) will yield less objects with bona - fide h@xmath3 excess than panel ( a ) .",
    "considering the number of detections and mismatches of figure[fig3 ] , we estimate that using the interpolated @xmath56 in place of @xmath29 a fraction of @xmath66 of the objects with h@xmath3 excess at the @xmath10 level would be missing and that for about @xmath67 of the detections the assigned statistical significance would be higher than indicated by direct @xmath29 measurements .",
    "we conclude that our interpolation scheme is quite reliable in that it can provide the correct identification of pms stars in no less 94% of the cases .",
    "while helpful to accurately identify pms stars , the @xmath26 colour excess alone does not immediately provide an absolute measure of the h@xmath3 luminosity @xmath4 nor of the equivalent width @xmath68 , which are necessary to arrive at the mass accretion rate . in order to measure @xmath4 , one needs a solid estimate of the stellar spectrum in the h@xmath3 band ( i.e. without the contribution of the emission ) .",
    "similarly , to measure @xmath68 , a solid estimate of the level of the stellar continuum inside the h@xmath3 band is needed .",
    "since the r band is over an order of magnitude wider than the h@xmath3 filter , it can not provide this information accurately , but only gives a rough estimate of the continuum level . in this section",
    "we present a simple method that allows us to measure @xmath4 for the objects with an h@xmath3 excess and to derive the level of their spectral continuum inside the h@xmath3 band , determining in this way also @xmath69 .",
    "the method is based on the simple consideration that , at any time , the largest majority of stars of a given effective temperature @xmath70 in a stellar population will have no excess h@xmath3 emission .",
    "therefore , for stars of that effective temperature , the _ average _ value of a colour index involving h@xmath3 ( for instance @xmath71 , and thus not just @xmath26 ) effectively defines a spectral reference template with respect to which the h@xmath3 colour excess should be sought .",
    "note that this is not only true for populations comprising both young and old stars , such as those typical of extragalactic stellar fields , but also for very young populations since pms objects show large variations in their h@xmath3 emission over hours or days ( e.g. fernandez et al .",
    "1995 ; smith et al . 1999 ; alencar et al .",
    "2001 ) , with only about one third of them at any given time being active h@xmath3 emitters above a @xmath72 threshold ( panagia et al .",
    "2000 ) .    to better clarify the working of our method , we display in figure[fig4 ] the @xmath71 colour as a function of @xmath32 for a set of stars taken from the catalogue of romaniello et al .",
    "this time , we have selected a total of @xmath73 stars , namely all objects with @xmath74mag , where the mean uncertainty @xmath46 is defined as in equation[eq1 ] , but for the v , i and h@xmath3 bands instead of v , i and r. therefore , no r - band information is used in this case and , in fact , no r - band data is needed . it should be noted that @xmath46 is dominated by the uncertainty on the h@xmath3 magnitude , while the median value of the uncertainty in the other two bands is @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the thick dashed line in figure[fig4 ] represents the average @xmath71 colour obtained as the running median with a box - car size of 100 points .",
    "the thin solid line shows the colours in these filters for the model atmospheres of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mentioned above ( note again the @xmath77mag discrepancy between models and observations around @xmath78 , most likely due to the coarse spectral sampling of the h@xmath3 line in the models ) . at the extremes of the distribution ( @xmath79 and @xmath62 ) the density of observed points decreases considerably . to determine the reference template there",
    ", we have reduced the box - car size to 10 points and averaged the running median obtained in this way with the theoretical models ( thin solid line ) . the thick dot - dashed line in figure[fig4 ]",
    "shows the best linear fit to the resulting average ( which is extrapolated for @xmath80 ) .",
    "a total of 189 objects , indicated by large dots in figure[fig4 ] , have a @xmath71 index exceeding that of the reference template at the same @xmath32 colour by more than four times the uncertainty on their @xmath71 values .",
    "these are the objects with a @xmath71 excess at the @xmath10 level and , as we shall see later , most of them are bona - fide pms stars .    since the contribution of the h@xmath3 line to the @xmath0 magnitude is completely negligible , the magnitude @xmath81 corresponding to the excess emission is simply :    @xmath82    where the superscript _ obs _ refers to the observations and _ ref _ to the reference template .",
    "once @xmath81 is determined in this way , the h@xmath3 emission line luminosity @xmath4 can be immediately obtained from the photometric zero point and absolute sensitivity of the instrumental set - up and from the distance to the sources .",
    "we have assumed a distance to the lmc and , more specifically , to sn1987a of @xmath83kpc ( panagia et al .",
    "1991 , later updated in panagia 1999 ) , whereas the photometric properties of the instrument were taken from the wfpc2 instrument handbook ( heyer & biretta 2004 ; namely inverse sensitivity photflam@xmath84 and photometric zero - point zp(vegamag)@xmath85 ) .",
    "we derive a median value of the luminosity of the 189 objects with h@xmath3 excess of @xmath86erg / s or @xmath87l@xmath88 .",
    "a histogram of the individual @xmath4 values is shown in figure[fig5 ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "it should be noted that , because of the width of the h@xmath3 filter , @xmath81 includes a small contribution due to [ nii ] emission features at @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "generally , their intensities do not exceed @xmath91% and @xmath92% , respectively , of the h@xmath3 line intensity , and in many instances the [ nii ] doublet lines are much weaker , i.e. @xmath93 of the h@xmath3 line intensity ( e.g. edwards et al .",
    "1987 ; hartigan , edwards & ghandour 1995 ) .",
    "these intensities should be even lower for pms stars in the lmc because of the lower metallicity relative to the milky way .",
    "however , to take a conservative approach , we have simply adopted an average value that is half of the maximum for galactic t - tauri stars and we give as uncertainty half of the measured range .",
    "we will therefore adopt average values of @xmath94% and @xmath95% relative to the h@xmath3 intensity , for the 6584 and 6548 [ nii ] lines , respectively ( note that the uncertainties after the @xmath96 sign here are meant to show the entire span of the range , not just the @xmath97 value ) . considering the width of the h@xmath3 filter of the wfpc2 ,",
    "only the 6548 [ nii ] line contaminates the h@xmath3 measurements , whereas for measurements made with the h@xmath3 filter on board the acs , both lines will be included ( albeit only in part for the 6548 line ) .",
    "although the resulting corrections on the h@xmath3 intensity are quite small ( namely @xmath98 for the wfpc2 f656n filter and @xmath99 for the acs f658n filter , on average ) , they are systematic and it is therefore good practice to apply them in all cases .    typically , the combined total uncertainty on our @xmath4 measurements is @xmath100 and is completely dominated by the statistical uncertainty on the h@xmath3 photometry . the systematic uncertainty on the distance to the field of sn1987a accounts for 5% ( see panagia 1999 ) , whereas the typical uncertainty on the absolute sensitivity of the instrumental setup is of order 3% .      if the stars defining the reference template had no h@xmath3 absorption features ( we have established above that they do not have h@xmath3 in emission ) , their @xmath71 index would correspond to that of the pure continuum and could then be used to derive the equivalent width of the h@xmath3 emission line , @xmath68 . while this approximation might be valid for stars with a conspicuous h@xmath3 emission , it is clearly not applicable in general .",
    "it is , however , possible in all cases to derive the level of the h@xmath3 continuum by using properly validated models atmospheres .    as discussed above , the models of bessell et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reproduce quite reliably the observed broad - band colours ( see e.g. figure[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this means that , even though the models might lack the resolution necessary to realistically reproduce spectral lines ( hence the small discrepancy between the dashed line and the squares in figure[fig3 ] ) , the level of the continuum can be trusted .",
    "one can , therefore , fit the continuum in those models in a range containing the h@xmath3 line ( e.g. @xmath101 ) and fold the resulting `` h@xmath3-less '' model spectra through the instrumental set - up ( e.g. with synphot ) , so as to derive the magnitude of the sole continuum in the h@xmath3 band ( @xmath102 ) as a function of spectral type or effective temperature .",
    "we present in the appendix the relationships between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath102 for several hst instruments and filters .",
    "the difference between the observed @xmath2 magnitude and @xmath102 provides a direct measure of @xmath68 , as we explain below .",
    "we recall that the equivalent width of a line is defined as :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the profile of the line , or the spectrum of the source divided by the intensity of the continuum , and the integration is extended over the spectral region corresponding to the line .",
    "if the line profile is very narrow when compared to the width of the filter , i.e. if the line falls completely within the filter bandpass as is typical of emission lines , then @xmath69 is simply given by the relationship :    @xmath105 \\label{eq4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath106 is the rectangular width of the filter ( similar in definition to the equivalent width of a line ) , which depends on the characteristics of the filter .",
    "values of @xmath106 for the h@xmath3 bands of past and current hst instruments are given in the appendix ( table[tab4 ] ) .",

    "the value of @xmath69 obtained in this way is also subject to some systematic uncertainties produced by the model atmospheres used to interpolate the level of the continuum , such as e.g. metallicity , surface gravity or spectral resolution , and should therefore be taken with caution . on the other hand ,",
    "we show in the appendix that the equivalent widths ( in absorption ) obtained by applying this method to the high - resolution model spectra of munari et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are in excellent agreement with those obtained via standard spectro - photometry ( see figure[fig18 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the values of @xmath69 that we obtain in the field of sn1987a are fully consistent with those of young pms stars . in figure[fig6 ] we show the value of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath32 for the @xmath73 selected stars .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there are 189 objects with a @xmath81 excess above the @xmath10 level and they are indicated as thick symbols ( circles and triangles ) in figure[fig6 ] . since the equivalent width shown in figure[fig6 ] is that of the pure emission component , the spectra of stars with small @xmath27 , say @xmath107 , actually show an h@xmath3 in absorption .",
    "for this reason , we conservatively ignore stars with measured @xmath108 , since this value is about the largest absorption equivalent width expected for normal stars ( see figure[fig18 ] in the appendix ) .",
    "a total of 164 objects satisfy this condition , but , in light of our conservative threshold , this must be considered as a lower - limit to the number of objects with genuine h@xmath3 excess .",
    "values of @xmath69 for the sample range from 10 to 650 , with a median of 19 .",

    "these equivalent widths are typical of pms stars ( e.g. muzerolle , hartmann & calvet 1998 ) and about two orders of magnitude smaller than those expected for pure nebular emission ( see discussion in section6 ) .",
    "while objects bluer than @xmath109 are probably ae / be stars , there are 133 redder stars with significant h@xmath3 excess ( marked as circles in figure[fig6 ] ) that are most likely bona - fide low - mass pms stars of various ages , as we will show in the following sections .",
    "a histogram of their h@xmath3 luminosities is shown in figure[fig5 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "it is generally accepted ( see e.g. hartmann et al . 1998 ) that the energy @xmath5 released by the magnetospheric accretion process goes towards ionising and heating the circumstellar gas . in this hypothesis ,",
    "the bolometric accretion luminosity @xmath5 can be determined from a measurement of the _ reradiated energy _ and , in particular , via the measured h@xmath3 luminosity that is produced in the process .    in order to determine the exact relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we have used literature values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 measurements as recently summarized by dahm ( 2008 ) for pms stars in the taurus ",
    "auriga association .",
    "as pointed out by dahm himself , there may be a serious problem in determining an empirical relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath110 measurements because the two quantities were determined from non - simultaneous observations .",
    "the intensity of the h@xmath3 line from pms sequence stars is known to vary by about 20% on a time scale of a few hours and by as much as a factor of 2  3 in a few days ( e.g. fernandez et al .",
    "1995 ; smith et al . 1999 ; alencar et al .",
    "2001 ) . for this reason ,",
    "a relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath111 is necessarily rather uncertain , although a very clear trend can be seen in the @xmath112 plot shown by dahm ( 2008 ) .",
    "his logarithmic best fit would provide a slope of @xmath113 for such a relationship . on the other hand , theoretical models ( e.g. muzerolle",
    ", calvet & hartmann 1998 ) would predict logarithmic slopes of about unity for low accretion rates , hence for faint h@xmath3 luminosities , and shallower slopes for higher luminosities .    in the absence of compelling evidence in favour or against a steep slope",
    ", we will adopt a logarithmic slope of unity for the empirical @xmath112 relationship , i.e. a constant ratio @xmath114 , and determine the proportionality constant from an elementary fit of the data summarised by dahm ( 2008 ) . on this basis",
    "we obtain :    @xmath115    as anticipated , the resulting uncertainty on @xmath5 is rather large , as high as a factor of 3 , but this is the best one can obtain with the available data sets . in view of the convenience and the feasibility of determining @xmath5 from @xmath4 for pms outside our own galaxy , it would be of paramount importance to obtain a proper calibration of the @xmath112 relationshipby making simultaneous spectral observations of pms stars over a suitably wide wavelength baseline , i.e. covering at least the range 30008000 , and possibly extending it to the near ir with measurements of paschen and brackett lines .",

    "for instance , if we had used siess et al.s ( 2000 ) tracks for metallicity 1/2 solar in place of those for 1/3 solar , the masses of our pms objects would be systematically higher by about 20% .",

    "r plane is almost parallel to the lines of constant radius ( as shown by the dot - dashed line for @xmath152r@xmath88 ) , extinction affects only marginally the estimate of the stellar radius",
    ". however , at low temperatures the reddening vector crosses the evolutionary tracks ( solid lines ) , thus leading to an underestimate of the stellar mass , if no extinction correction is applied . in turn , this will result in a systematically higher value of the @xmath153 ratio and , therefore , in an overestimate of the mass accretion rate derived via equation[eq6 ] .    in order to better gauge the uncertainty on the value of @xmath153 caused by unaccounted extinction",
    ", we have determined the mass and radius of each one of the artificially reddened model stars shown in figure[fig10 ] , in exactly the same way in which we did that for bona - fide pms stars , and compared those with the known input values .",
    "the result is shown graphically in figure[fig11 ] , where , the relation between the derived and input @xmath153 ratios is shown as a function of colour excess @xmath154 .",
    "regardless of the input parameters ( @xmath134 , @xmath133 or @xmath153 ) , it appears that over the range explored here the derived @xmath153 ratio increases slowly with colour excess ( see dashed line that best fits the median values indicated by the crosses ) . in particular , underestimating the @xmath154 colour excess by @xmath145mag would lead to a 30% overestimate of @xmath153 ( and hence of @xmath24 ) .",
    "this appears unlikely , considering that the best estimate of the total extinction  including the milky way component  towards star 2 , one of the two bright close companions to sn1987a , is @xmath155 ( scuderi et al .",
    "1996 ) , with a @xmath97 dispersion over the field of @xmath156 ( romaniello 1998 ; panagia et al .",
    "according to zaritsky et al . (",
    "2004 ) , the average reddening towards cool ( 5500k@xmath1576500k ) stars in the lmc is @xmath158 , thus implying @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , for an average lmc star forming region , omitting the extinction correction would result in a 10% overestimate of the mass accretion rate . this error , albeit systematic , is smaller than most other systematic uncertainties and comparable to the measurement errors .",
    "nonetheless , we would like to stress here that the effects of patchy absorption can be more severe in regions of high extinction .",
    "therefore , whenever possible , one should apply extinction corrections to each individual stars , as it was done for the photometric catalogue of romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that we use here .",
    "the underlying assumption in the determination of the mass accretion rate of pms stars is that the gravitational energy @xmath5 released in the accretion process goes into heating of the gas at the boundary layer ( see e.g. hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this case",
    ", the luminosity of the h@xmath3 emission line can provide a measure of the accretion energy , because it acts as a natural `` detector '' of the luminosity released in the accretion process .",
    "thus , the issue to address is whether the measured @xmath4 is produced only and entirely as a result of the energy released in the accretion process .",
    "obviously , depending on the geometry and orientation of the circumstellar disc and on the specifics of the accretion process , some of the ionising energy could escape without effectively ionising the local gas .",
    "this would result in an underestimate of the true mass accretion rate for some stars , but this is true of any method that uses h emission lines as indicators of the accretion process and , therefore , it does not affect the comparison of our results with those of others ( see figure[fig9 ] ) .",
    "one possibility that we can readily exclude is that the h@xmath3 emission that we detect is due to chromospheric activity .",
    "the total chromospheric emission of a solar - type star on the subgiant branch corresponds to a luminosity of about @xmath160l@xmath161 ( ulmschneider 1979 ; pasquini et al . 2000 ) , i.e. two orders of magnitude less than what we measure .    on the other hand",
    ", we must also consider the possibility that h@xmath3 emission might occur in discrete h knots along the line of sight , in places unrelated with the pms object .",
    "furthermore , hot nearby massive stars may ionise the h gas in which pms stars are immersed , eventually producing h@xmath3 emission when the gas recombines .",
    "both these effects would result in a overestimate of @xmath6 , but we show below that the probability of this happening is very small .    as for intervening h@xmath3 emission along the line of sight , it would have to arise in knots of ionised h , e.g. very compact hii regions , contained within our photometric apertures . however ,",
    "if such knots exist , they should not project only against stars and , therefore , narrow - band images should reveal h@xmath3 emission where broad - band imaging shows no or very low signal ( see section 6.3 ) .",
    "since this is not observed , statistical arguments rule out this possibility as a significant source of the observed h@xmath3 excess emission .    while it is possible that some of the h@xmath3 emission that we detect is due to diffuse nebular emission in the hii region not powered by the accretion process , if the emission is extended and uniform over an area of at least @xmath162 radius around the star its contribution cancels out with the rest of the background when we perform aperture photometry ( using an aperture of @xmath163 radius for the object and an annulus of @xmath164 for the background ) .",
    "the subtraction would not work if the emission were not uniform , as for example in the case of a filament that projects over the star but that does not cover completely the background annulus .",
    "however , we have visually inspected all objects with excess h@xmath3 emission and excluded the few cases where a spurious filament of this type could be seen ( see romaniello 1998 ; panagia et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "another case in which the emission does not cancel out is when the gas ionised by an external source is associated to the star and completely contained within our photometric aperture .",
    "we recall here that the typical size of a circumstellar disc is of order 100 au ( e.g. hartmann et al . 1998 ) , or about @xmath165 pixel at the distance of sn1987a , and that the median @xmath4 that we measure for our pms stars is @xmath166ergs@xmath14 , or about @xmath87l@xmath88 ( see figure[fig5 ] ) .",
    "we can then calculate how close a pms stars should be to a hot , uv - bright star for the latter to flood the pms circumstellar disc with enough ionising radiation to cause at least 10% of the h@xmath3 luminosity that we measure from that source .",
    "let @xmath167au be the external radius of the circumstellar disc and @xmath168 the distance to an ionising star that illuminates the disc , assumed to have zero inclination ( i.e. face on ) , so that @xmath169 is the solid angle subtended by the disc .",

    "besides the three brightest stars mentioned above , we have included as potential sources of the detected h@xmath3 emission an additional 12 stars in the field with @xmath195 and @xmath196 , as classified by romaniello et al .",
    "we note that these estimates of @xmath190 are firm upper limits because we are assuming that _",
    "( i ) _ all disks are _ face - on _ relative to the hot stars , and that _ ( ii ) _ the projected distances on the sky are indeed the actual distances from the hot stars .",
    "the values of @xmath197 obtained in this way for the 133 bona - fide pms stars span the range @xmath198l@xmath88 , or typically three orders of magnitude less than the median pms h@xmath3 luminosity , as shown by the histogram in figure[fig12 ] .",
    "we can , therefore , conclude that in this specific field the contribution of hot ionising stars to the measured excess h@xmath3 emission is negligible .",
    "we must stress , however , that the effect might be much more pronounced in younger star forming regions , such as the orion nebula or 30 dor .",
    "finally , consideration must be given to the role of the nebular continuum , i.e. radiation caused by bound ",
    "free and free  free transitions in the gas and unrelated to the stellar photosphere .",
    "if present , nebular continuum will add to the intrinsic continuum of the star , thereby affecting both the observed total level and the slope .",
    "this could ultimately alter the measured broad - band colours of the source , thereby thwarting our attempts to infer the level of the continuum in the h@xmath3 band from the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes .",
    "it is important to estimate the magnitude of this effect , as our method relies on the intrinsic @xmath32 colour of a star to derive its @xmath81 ( see equation[eq2 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , the contribution of the nebular continuum appears to be insignificant . to prove this ,",
    "we have assumed a fully ionised gas of pure h , considering only bound  free and free  free transitions and ignoring the contribution to the continuum from two - photon emission ( spitzer & greenstein 1951 ) .",
    "using osterbrock s ( 1989 , chapter 4 ) tabulations , we find h@xmath3 line intensity and h@xmath3 continuum fluxes of the nebular gas as shown in table[tab2 ] , for gas electron temperatures in the range 5000k  20000k .",
    "the purely nebular @xmath69 ranges from @xmath199 to @xmath200 , or two orders of magnitude higher than what we measure for pms objects .",
    "we can , therefore , safely conclude that the nebular contribution to the continuum is negligible ( less than 1% ) .    furthermore , we find that for gas temperatures in the range 5000k  10000k the @xmath32 colour of the nebular continuum varies from @xmath201 to @xmath202 , spanning a range typical of g  k type stars .",

    "we have developed and successfully tested a new self - consistent method to reliably identify all pms objects actively undergoing mass accretion in a resolved stellar population , regardless of their age , without requiring spectroscopy .",
    "the method combines broad - band @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry with narrow - band @xmath2 imaging to : ( 1 ) identify all stars with excess h@xmath3 emission using as a reference template of the photospheric luminosity in the h@xmath3 band the average @xmath71 colour of stars with small photometric errors ; ( 2 ) convert the excess h@xmath3 magnitude into h@xmath3 luminosity @xmath4 via the absolute photometric calibration of the h@xmath3 band ; ( 3 ) convert , if desired , the excess h@xmath3 magnitude into the h@xmath3 emission equivalent width , using model spectra to fit the level of the continuum in the h@xmath3 band ; ( 4 ) derive the accretion luminosity @xmath5 from @xmath4 using a relationship based on recent literature values ; ( 5 ) obtain the mass accretion rate @xmath212 from the free - fall equation that links it to @xmath5 via the stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) , that we derive from the h ",
    "r diagram using pre - main sequence tracks for the appropriate metallicity .",
    "since no spectroscopy of individual objects is needed , observations requiring just a few hours of exposure time can suffice to reveal hundreds of pms stars simultaneously , determine their h@xmath3 luminosity with an uncertainty of less than 15% and derive their mass accretion rates with the same accuracy as allowed by conventional spectral line analysis .    as regards the h@xmath3 luminosity ,",
    "the virtue of this new method is that it derives the reference luminosity of the stellar photosphere inside the specific h@xmath3 band simply from the average @xmath71 colour of stars with the same @xmath32 index ( see figure[fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is possible because , at any given time , the majority of the stars in a stellar field have no excess h@xmath3 emission . obviously , the average luminosity of the stellar photosphere in the h@xmath3 band reflects more or less pronounced h@xmath3 absorption features , depending on the spectral type of the objects , and precisely for this reason it defines the reference luminosity with respect to which any excess emission should be sought and measured .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the derived @xmath4 is dominated by statistical errors in the photometry and does not exceed 15% for our @xmath10 selection ( see section3.1 ) .",
    "note that this approach is also applicable to populations comprising mostly very young objects , such as the orion nebula , since excess h@xmath3 emission is found in only about one third of the pms stars at any given time and , therefore , the majority of the very young objects will not have a conspicuous h@xmath3 emission , thus correctly defining the reference template ( see section3.1 ) .    in spite of the good accuracy on @xmath4 ,",
    "deriving the mass accretion rate requires the use of a rather uncertain relationship linking @xmath4 to the accretion luminosity ( see section4 and also dahm 2008 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the relationship can have a systematic effect of up to a factor of 3 on the value of @xmath24 .",
    "this is the unfortunate consequence of our incomplete understanding of the physics of the accretion process , plagued by the lack of direct measurements of the bolometric accretion luminosity @xmath5 , as well as by the paucity of simultaneous measurements of the hot continuum excess emission and of the emission line fluxes in h@xmath3 or other lines ( e.g. pa@xmath22 and br@xmath23 ) .",
    "although annoying , the systematic uncertainty of up to a factor of 3 on @xmath212 is similar to that plaguing age determinations based on the comparison with theoretical isochrones , which can reach a factor of 2 ( see section6.1 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "these systematics affect in the same way all determinations of @xmath6 that make use of emission lines diagnostics , including those based on a detailed study of the profile and intensity of the h@xmath3 line ( e.g. muzerolle et al .",
    "1998b ) , since their calibration relies on the same measurements .",
    "for this reason , the relative values of @xmath6 that we obtain are trustworthy and the comparison of our results with those obtained with other methods remains meaningful .    as discussed in sections3 and 4 , as an application of our method , we have studied the field of sn1987a , where we identify 133 bona - fide pms stars , based on their large h@xmath3 excess .",
    "the median value of the mass accretion rate that we find for these stars , namely @xmath213m@xmath13yr@xmath14 , is in very good agreement with the median value of @xmath214m@xmath13yr@xmath14 found by romaniello et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from the analysis of the distribution of the @xmath215 colour excess in the same field . while we have identified 133 bona - fide pms stars with an h@xmath3 excess above the @xmath10 level , romaniello et al .",
    "conclude that 765 stars with an excess @xmath15-band luminosity larger than @xmath216l@xmath88 could be bona - fide pms candidates , albeit at the @xmath217 level .",
    "the approach followed by romaniello et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is statistical in nature and , while providing a solid estimate of the average mass accretion rate , it does not allow one to reliably identify individual pms stars",
    ". therefore , romaniello et al . turned to the h@xmath3 excess emission ( namely @xmath26 ) as a more direct indicator of ongoing accretion and found a strong correlation between the @xmath15-band continuum excess and @xmath69 for stars with @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "not surprisingly , the more stringent threshold on the equivalent width adopted in the present study , i.e. @xmath220 , results in a smaller number of identified of bona - fide pms stars , but also in a much smaller uncertainty .",
    "indeed , the method that we present here is more direct than the one based on the @xmath15-band excess , since it does not require the use of model atmospheres to predict the level of the intrinsic photospheric continuum in the @xmath15 band from the observed optical colours , and as such it results in a more reliable determination of the accretion luminosity .    our method , therefore , makes it possible for the first time to carry out a quantitative and systematic study of the properties of a large number of pms stars , including those in dense and/or distant star forming regions .",
    "this allows us to tackle some still open questions as to the evolution of both the stars and their discs .",
    "for instance , in the field of sn1987a , we have studied how the mass accretion rate changes with time as our bona - fide pms stars approach their main sequence .",
    "we find that @xmath6 decreases more slowly with time than what is observed for low - mass t - tauri stars in the galaxy ( see section5 ) and predicted by models of viscous disc evolution ( hartmann et al .",
    "however , our results are in excellent agreement with the ( so far limited ) measurements of the mass accretion rate of g type stars in the milky way ( e.g. sicilia  aguilar et al .",
    "2006 ) , thus lending credit to the hypothesis that @xmath6 might depend on the stellar mass .",
    "moreover , our method allows us to investigate whether and how the accretion process is affected by the chemical composition and density of the molecular clouds or by the proximity of hot , massive ionising stars .",
    "we will address the effects of metallicity in a forthcoming paper ( de marchi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) devoted to a comparison of star formation in the small and large magellanic clouds . as for the effect of hot massive stars ,",
    "we have studied the distribution of the 133 bona - fide pms objects with respect to the baricentre of the 15 hottest stars in the field , described in section6.3 .",
    "we find a clear anti - correlation , shown in figure[fig13 ] , between the frequency of the identified pms stars and their distance from the ionising objects ( marked with blue star symbols in figure[fig14 ] ) .",
    "this effect is not seen for non - pms objects of similar brightness , whose distribution is uniform over the whole field , confirming that the trend is not due to problems in detecting faint objects near the brightest stars .",
    "the trend remains the same whether the baricentre of the hot stars is computed using as weight their bolometric luminosity or their ionising flux .",
    "this anti - correlation is quite remarkable in several ways , as we discuss below .    in figure[fig14 ]",
    "we show a schematic map of the distribution of all 133 pms objects with respect to the 15 ionising stars .",
    "the baricentre of the ionising flux is shown by the large square and concentric annuli are drawn from it , in increments of 35 . for reference , a red ellipse marks the position of sn1987a .",
    "symbols of different colours indicate pms stars with different h@xmath3 luminosity , from red for @xmath221l@xmath88 to white for @xmath222l@xmath88 , with green diamonds corresponding to intermediate values .",
    "an inspection to figure[fig14 ] immediately reveals two important facts : ( _ i _ ) there are very few pms stars near the baricentre of the massive objects and ( _ ii _ ) their h@xmath3 luminosity is systematically lower than that of pms stars farther away .",
    "panagia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) had already pointed out that there is no overdensity of young pms objects around hot massive stars in this field .",
    "this shows that low - mass and massive stars do not follow each other , suggesting that their formation mechanisms are separate and distinct .",
    "but what figure[fig14 ] additionally shows is that there are very few pms stars with strong h@xmath3 luminosity ( red squares ) around the young massive stars , with only 20% of them within a 70arcsec radius of the baricentre .",
    "conversely , stars with low h@xmath3 luminosity ( white squares ) are distributed rather uniformly across the field .    with a median age of @xmath11myr ,",
    "most pms objects are much older than the @xmath223myr old hot stars and must belong to a previous generation .",
    "thus , no spatial relationship ( whether a correlation or anti - correlation ) should be expected between the distribution of the two types of objects . on the other hand , while we can not exclude that originally fewer pms stars formed in the region now populated by young massive stars , there are indications that the local paucity of pms objects is only apparent and caused by the presence of the hot young stars .    the fact that pms objects near the youngest hot stars are both less numerous and fainter in h@xmath3 emission suggests that their circumstellar discs have been considerably eroded and made less efficient by enhanced photo - evaporation .",
    "we have shown earlier ( see section6.3 and figure[fig12 ] ) that the instantaneous contribution to the h@xmath3 luminosity from the ionising radiation of nearby massive stars is negligible .",
    "the results shown in figure[fig14 ] confirms that this is the case .",
    "if it were not and the observed h@xmath3 luminosity were mostly due to fluorescence of the circumstellar discs under the effect of the ionising radiation of massive stars , the radial distribution should be opposite to the one observed , with brighter h@xmath3 luminosities for pms stars closer to the baricentre of the youngest hot stars .",
    "thus , if the apparent paucity of pms objects in their vicinity is the result of photo - evaporation , the latter must be mostly due to the effects of non - ionising far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation .",
    "when integrated over the lifetime of massive stars ( @xmath224myr ) , their fuv radiation can be quite significant for the disruption of nearby circumstellar discs .",
    "in particular , this also means that there might be many more objects still in their pms phase , close to the hot stars , but we have no way to identify them as such , since the photo - evaporation of their discs has stopped the accretion process .",
    "recent theoretical studies of the erosion of circumstellar discs via photo - evaporation due to external fuv radiation ( e.g. adams et al .",
    "2004 ) or to the pms star itself ( e.g. alexander , clarke & pringle 2006a ; 2006b ) suggest timescales of order 810myr for the complete dissolution of the discs .",
    "although this is the right order of magnitude for the timescale of the process that we see , there are still some discrepancies . for instance , it is clear that if discs were to completely dissolve under the effect of their own central star within 510myr , as suggested by alexander et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , the majority of our pms objects , with a median age of @xmath11myr , should not show any sign of accretion .",
    "similarly , with a typical age of 2myr , the hottest stars in our field would have not had time to deposit enough uv photons on to the pms discs to seriously erode them , if the process is to take of order 10myr ( adams et al .",
    "2004 ) . while recently clarke ( 2007 ) suggested that the effect of nearby massive young stars may be stronger , leading to disc exhaustion timescales of order 2myr",
    ", her calculations apply to the immediate vicinity ( @xmath225pc ) of very massive stars , such as the o6 star @xmath226 in orion .",
    "the density of massive stars in the field of sn1987a is much lower than that present in the orion nebula and the distances to our pms objects typically an order of magnitude larger than those considered by clarke ( 2007 ) .    nevertheless ,",
    "while it is clear that the theory of disc photo - evaporation does not yet capture all the details , we believe that it can greatly benefit from the observations presented here .",
    "in particular , it will be necessary to explain which mechanisms allow isolated circumstellar discs to feed their central pms stars for well over 20myr , at least in a low - metallicity , low - density environment such as the field of the lmc .",
    "at the same time , the models should justify the quick ( @xmath227myr ) demise of the pms discs within a ( projected ) radius of @xmath19pc of a handful of late o stars . extending our investigation ,",
    "as we plan to do , to more and denser regions , such as ngc1850 and 30dor in the large magellanic cloud and ngc346 and ngc602 in the small magellanic cloud , will offer increased statistics and a much wider variety of star formation environments .",

    "<S> we have developed and successfully tested a new self - consistent method to reliably identify pre - main sequence ( pms ) objects actively undergoing mass accretion in a resolved stellar population , regardless of their age . </S>",
    "<S> the method does not require spectroscopy and combines broad - band @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry with narrow - band @xmath2 imaging to : ( 1 ) identify all stars with excess h@xmath3 emission ; ( 2 ) convert the excess h@xmath3 magnitude into h@xmath3 luminosity @xmath4 ; ( 3 ) estimate the h@xmath3 emission equivalent width ; ( 4 ) derive the accretion luminosity @xmath5 from @xmath4 ; and finally ( 5 ) obtain the mass accretion rate @xmath6 from @xmath5 and the stellar parameters ( mass and radius ) . by selecting stars with an accuracy of 15% or better in the h@xmath3 photometry , the statistical uncertainty on the derived @xmath6 is typically @xmath7 and is dictated by the precision of the h@xmath3 photometry . </S>",
    "<S> systematic uncertainties , of up to a factor of 3 on the value of @xmath6 , are caused by our incomplete understanding of the physics of the accretion process and affect all determinations of the mass accretion rate , including those based on a spectroscopic h@xmath3 line analysis .    as an application of our method </S>",
    "<S> , we study the accretion process in a field of @xmath8 arcmin@xmath9 around sn1987a , using existing hubble space telescope photometry . we identify as bona - fide pms stars a total of 133 objects with a h@xmath3 excess above the @xmath10 level and a median age of @xmath11myr . </S>",
    "<S> their median mass accretion rate of @xmath12m@xmath13yr@xmath14 is in excellent agreement with previous determinations based on the @xmath15-band excess of the stars in the same field , as well as with the value measured for g - type pms stars in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion luminosity of these pms objects shows a strong dependence on their distance from a group of hot massive stars in the field and suggests that the ultraviolet radiation of the latter is rapidly eroding the circumstellar discs around pms stars . </S>"
