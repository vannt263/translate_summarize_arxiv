    "the tauola package @xcite for the simulation of @xmath0-lepton decays and photos @xcite for the simulation of radiative corrections in decays , are computing projects with a rather long history . written and maintained by well - defined authors , they nonetheless migrated into a wide range of applications where they became ingredients of complicated simulation chains . as a consequence , a large number of different versions are presently in use . from the algorithmic point of view",
    ", they often differ only in a few small details , but incorporate many specific results from distinct @xmath0-lepton measurements .",
    "such versions were mainly maintained ( and will remain so ) by the experiments taking precision data on @xmath0 leptons . on the other hand , many new applications were developed recently , often requiring a program interface to other packages ( e.g. generating events for lhc , lc , belle or babar physics processes ) .    in the last two years some progress in the simulation of @xmath0-pair production alone was achieved .",
    "a control of the systematic errors was improved and a special tool developed for that purpose , mc - tester , turned out to be very useful . with its help , the new version of tauola , which may become the starting point for the work directly oriented towards phenomenology of b - factories , was prepared .",
    "mc - tester became instrumental in developing the new version of photos for radiative corrections in decays .",
    "with its help tests enabling verification of the program in multiple photon radiation mode became possible , thus establishing photos as a precision tool for simulation of radiative bremsstrahlung in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and higgs boson decay .",
    "new results for @xmath0 physics were obtained as well .    because of the limited space and sizeable amount of physically interesting numerical results , only some of them will be included in the conference proceedings . for the remaining ones we refer the reader to references and transparencies from the talk .",
    "in refs . @xcite the setup for constructing specific versions of tauola and photos from the single set of files was prepared and documented .",
    "the system was prepared for the software librarians and advanced users interested in updating the packages for the multipurpose environment .",
    "the idea was to create a repository which allows one to keep all main options of tauola developed for different purposes in a relatively compact form , without duplications of semi - identical parts .",
    "the repository was set to produce standard fortran files which can later be handled exactly the same way as the early 1990 versions of the packages , but with physics initialization based on cleo and aleph data of the years 1997  98 . during the conference ,",
    "another generating system was developed in parallel , to start new work with the belle and babar collaborations .",
    "physics initialization remained as in cleo , but 60 new channels were prepared ( without physical initialization ) for the future implementations to be done within those collaborations . to facilitate integration ,",
    "the generic subdirectory tauola / tauola - bbb was prepared .",
    "the new versions can be now initialized with the help of the command make with parameters authors , belle or babar . whether this solution will become accepted needs to be investigated .",
    "the geographical spread of interested people over three continents is certainly a disadvantage .",
    "recently some extensive tests and extensions were introduced into photos , an algorithm for radiative corrections in decays of particles or resonances .",
    "thanks to comparisons with the single - photon exact matrix - element for the @xmath1 decay correcting weight was introduced ( in this particular case , see fig [ nufig ] ) .",
    "the method applied can also serve as an example for similar correcting weights to be introduced in other decay channels , of more importance for the b - factories community . in theses cases correcting weights",
    "may be of a more phenomenological nature , and to some degree may represent a fit to the data .",
    "( 800,1200 ) ( 375,750)(0,0)[b ] ( 1225,750)(0,0)[b ] ( -20 , -100)(0,0)[lb ] ( -20 , 340)(0,0)[lb ]    in the second part of the extension of photos we have followed the solution presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the iterative algorithm of multiple photon emission .",
    "thanks to a better understanding of the numerical stability of the algorithm , we were able to go beyond double photon - emission , and extend the iteration up to quadruple emission .",
    "once this was achieved we were able to complete the exponentiation programme , still preserving full control of terms providing leading logs as well as the soft photon region of the photon emission .",
    "it is important to note that the algorithm covers full phase space for photon emission , except soft regions where photon emission is integrated analytically and added together to the virtual corrections . thanks to the exponentiation , we could lower the value of the minimal energy of generated photons to the level of @xmath3 or @xmath4 without any problems .",
    "this was plaguing the project until now .",
    "this goal required an important development for numerical stability .",
    "photos operates on four - vectors , that is why explicit generation of photons at small energies immediately leads to loss of the numerical stability of additional 6 orders .",
    "therefore a special algorithm to prevent accumulation of rounding errors was developed .",
    "on the technical side let us remark that this special correcting routine , phcork , had to be called after every emission of individual photons ( routine phomak .",
    "phomak has to assure that energy - momentum is conserved in the decay branch and that four - momenta of all particles are precisely on mass - shell .",
    "once the list of necessary modifications was completed we performed extensive tests using the method presented in the next section .",
    "this helped to establish the precision of photos in the case of @xmath2 decay at the permille level .",
    "comparison tests with koralz and kkmc support such conjecture . in the case of @xmath1 decay",
    "it was confirmed by comparison with winhac @xcite .",
    "mc - tester is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the principle of this testing package is to analyse series of events originating from a monte carlo generator ( or a system of several monte carlos combined together ) .",
    "in fact only a branch originating from the decay of some intermediate resonance or particles is examined . in a fully automated way ( thereby limiting manpower and also the risk of accidental errors ) the output from the run is created .",
    "if a similar run for a different generator ( possibly even written in different programing language ) is performed , then the two files with information collected by mc - tester can be compared and the result of the test can be presented in a visualised form as a booklet of plots and tables with general information on the run , a list of the decay channels , their branching ratios , and sdp parameter .",
    "such a test was very useful in the case of validation of tauola .",
    "however , in cases where an arbitrary number of final - state particles could be present ( as in the case of final - state qed bremsstrahlung ) the test required an extension .    there may be quite big differences in the way bremsstrahlung is generated by the programs for decays . in our test , we aim to develop a technique where comparisons make physical sense and are automatic . to this end",
    ", we have to free our test from dependence on the technical parameters of the generators , such as a minimal photon energy threshold , hence ambiguities due to the number of soft photons generated , explicit choices for lorentz frames of generation , etc .    independently",
    "from how events are generated , we define zero- , one- or two - photon topologies .",
    "we will call the event to be of ` zero photons ' , if there is no photon at all of energies larger than the @xmath5 parameter of the test .",
    "the ` one - photon ' event will have to have one ( and only one ) photon of energy larger than @xmath5 .",
    "if there is more than one such photon , we shall call it ` two - photon ' event .",
    "if there are more than two photons of energy larger than @xmath5 , then we consider only the two most energetic photons , and treat the remaining ones as if they did not pass the @xmath5 threshold .    there may be cases where more than two photons actually considered ( e.g. with energies not passing the @xmath5 threshold ) are present .",
    "following the leading - log - inspired logic , we will add them to the momenta of outgoing fermions ( always to the fermion of a smaller angular separation ) .",
    "we define two tests : test1 and test2 .",
    "test2 is exactly as explained above . in case of test1",
    ", only one photon ( the most energetic one ) can be accepted .",
    "the test has therefore two parameters :     maximal multiplicity ( of photons ) defines whether test1 or test2 is used     minimum photon energy : @xmath5    3 mm * tests of photos in @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays * 3 mm    tests of comparisons for photos with kkmc and koralz @xcite for @xmath2 decay and with winhac @xcite for @xmath1 are collected on the webpage  @xcite .",
    "these tests are quite extensive and we can not present here even the most important results .",
    "that is why only an example illustrating the general form of the results is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ifi - second ] .",
    "the upper part of the figure presents the comparison ` hyper - table ' .",
    "comparisons of photos running with different options ( single- double- triple- quadruple- and multiple - radiation with the results from kkmc and koralz monte carlo programs are collected .",
    "the first column of the table defines the generator used ( with options ) for the numerical results collected ; the second part of the table collect branching ratios obtained from test1 and test2 as described above , respectively for configuration with 0,1 ( test1 ) and 0,1,2 photons ( test2 ) . later the maximum of the sdp ( as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is given .",
    "as reference point , the first entry after the definition of @xmath5 is used ; in this table results from kkmc are used .",
    "the last two columns represent hyper - links to the comparison booklets ( not included in the articles but available from @xcite ) .",
    "the booklets of standard mc - tester format @xcite include the plots like the one presented in the middle of fig .",
    "[ fig : ifi - second ] for invariant mass of @xmath6 where the largest difference between results from the kkmc and photos version with exponentiation is visible .",
    "( 800,1500 ) ( -20 , 710)(0,0)[lb ] ( -20 , 400)(0,0)[lb ] ( -20 , -120)(0,0)[lb ]    one can observe , rather unexpectedly , a good agreement between photos and kkmc .",
    "in fact only in the case when the full double - photon matrix - element in kkmc is used is the agreement with photos good . if a less powerful matrix - element that does not rely on the spin amplitude exponentiation scheme of koralz is used , or a second - order matrix - element is switched off in kkmc , differences from the full exponentiated version of photos , quantified with the help of sdp , increase .",
    "what could be even more unexpected is that the effects of coherence between photons is to a large degree reproduced by the photos algorithm .",
    "this delicate point is still under investigation .",
    "some numerical results are collected on the web page @xcite in subsection ` photos improved antenna algorithm ' . however , this point is of no numerical interest for bremsstrahlung in decays , at least not for present - day applications , because the observed effects are too small . on the other hand ,",
    "this point is interesting as a potentially important ingredient for constructing high - precision monte carlos for future applications ; either for qed at linear colliders , or for qcd at the lhc .    in the case of @xmath1",
    "decays our comparisons for multiple photon emission were limited to comparisons with winhac @xcite .",
    "less good agreement , but still better than required by present - day applications , was achieved .",
    "we did not investigate the sources of the residual discrepancies .",
    "the good candidates were limitations of the correcting weight used in photos , see discussion above , and the fact that the winhac matrix - element is limited to the first order only .",
    "more detailed numerical discussion of this point could not be included in the conference contribution presented because of space limitation .",
    "3 mm * tests of tauola and photos in leptonic @xmath0 decays * 3 mm in the case of the @xmath0 lepton physics , the discussion presented above may be of no practical consequences .",
    "however , the methodology developed for qed bremsstrahlung ( and tests ) in case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays could also be applied for leptonic @xmath0 decays . with the methods analogous",
    "as presented above , we have found that the difference between single - photon full matrix - element generation of tauola and the single - photon option of photos is larger than between the first - order and exponentiated mode of operation of photos , see ref .",
    "we could conclude that the matrix element of tauola for @xmath7 is better than the exponentiated version of photos .",
    "this conjecture is true at least for semi - inclusive quantities as discussed here .",
    "of course for generation of events with explicit multiple - photon final - states , the results generated with photos will be more precise .",
    "the universal interface of tauola for ` any ' @xmath0 production generator is distributed together with tauola @xcite . it uses as an input the hepevt common block and operates on its content only . as a demonstration example",
    "the interface is combined with the jetset generator @xcite .",
    "the interface works in the following way :    * the @xmath0-lepton should be forced to be stable in the @xmath0 production generator . *",
    "the content of the hepevt common block is searched for all @xmath0 leptons and neutrinos first .",
    "* we check if there are @xmath0-flavour pairs ( two @xmath0-leptons or @xmath0-lepton and @xmath0-neutrino ) originating from the same mother . *",
    "the decays of the @xmath0-flavour pairs are performed with tauola .",
    "longitudinal spin effects are generated in the case of the @xmath0 produced from the decay of : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the neutral higgs boson @xmath10 , and the charged higgs boson @xmath11 .",
    "parallel or anti - parallel spin configurations are generated , before calling on the @xmath0 decay , and then the decays of 100% polarized @xmath0 s are executed . * in the case of the higgs boson ( for the spin - correlations to be generated ) the identifier of the @xmath0 s mother must be that of the higgs . in this case",
    "it was rather easy to implement full spin - correlations .",
    "* in case the @xmath0 lepton is not produced from any of the above - mentioned intermediate states , then if there is produced alsoa @xmath12 from the same mother as that of the @xmath0 , the @xmath1 is reconstructed by the interface as the sum of the two .",
    "similarly , @xmath13 is reconstructed if another @xmath0 is produced from the same mother .",
    "this organization of software became quite productive .",
    "it was helpful to perform studies of observables for higgs boson parity measurement at future lcs . in this case",
    "it was important that full spin correlations for the multi - layer cascade process",
    "@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 be included @xcite .",
    "also , in the case of studies for the higgs discovery potential at lc , the implementation of the universal interface was useful and productive @xcite to better visualize possible difficulties .",
    "recently @xcite , the interface had proven to be useful for studies of cp parity effects in @xmath17 system produced at belle / babar energies , when one of the @xmath18-mesons decays into a pair of @xmath0 leptons .",
    "this process , even though not discovered so far , provides another example of the usefulness of the universal interface .",
    "the status of the computer programs for the decay of @xmath0 leptons and associated projects was reviewed .",
    "the high - precision version of photos for radiative corrections was presented . in particular ,",
    "the option to run the program with multiple - photon radiation was presented . the results for decays of @xmath0-leptons , @xmath2 and @xmath1 bosons were mentioned .",
    "it was found that for semi - inclusive single- and double - photon final - states the agreement with the matrix element simulations of the second - order is at the 0.1% level . only at the tails of some distributions ,",
    "the approximation used in photos was visible and gave a discrepancy of the 15% level in sparsely populated corners of the phase - space .",
    "the presentation of the tauola general - purpose interface was ommited because of lack of time .",
    "examples for its use in the case of the higgs boson parity measurement at a future linear collider @xcite and for higgs searches at the lhc can be found in the literature .",
    "recently , a similar application was developed for the case of studies in hypothetical effects of cp - parity breaking in the @xmath19-@xmath20 system at belle and babar @xcite . at present , in its full content , it is available from the authors upon individual request only .",
    "distinct versions of the tauola library for @xmath0 lepton decay , and of photos for radiative corrections in decays , are now in use . the principles of the distribution package , as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , are carefully preserved to save continuity of the project , and for the comfort of the users . in this scheme",
    "the new version of photos is now available from the home page of z. was @xcite .",
    "however , on top of the previously available versions of tauola , an extension was prepared to introduce new optional and/or missing decay modes from the independent files . in these generating files 60 new channels of @xmath0 decays were drafted on top of the previously available ones .",
    "as previously , the system for creating the required version of the photos and tauola packages from the single master copies is preserved .",
    "the master copies are kept in relatively compact and clear form , without unnecessary code duplications .",
    "development of mc - tester was a necessary step to prepare the translation of tauola to new programming language such as c++ , however , it is also very important to perform such transformation together with the program s users . at present , there is no pressure from the experimental community for such transformation to be imminent .",
    "as far as the package authors are concerned , such a possibility has been envisaged for some time now .",
