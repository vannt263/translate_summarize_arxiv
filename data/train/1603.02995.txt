    "diffusive motion is ubiquitous in nature and plays a fundamental role in the motility of swimming microorganisms  @xcite .",
    "researchers in statistical mechanics have focused on phenomena where anomalous diffusion are present  @xcite .",
    "also , the field of non - extensive statistical mechanics has made an advance in the understanding of several systems where boltzmann thermodynamic fails to explain the results  @xcite .",
    "for instance , anomalous diffusion and non - gaussian velocity distribution have been observed in the context of _ hydra _ cells  @xcite , where maximum entropy densities associated with non - standard entropic measures were used to describe the motion of these cells .",
    "these densities are related to nonlinear diffusive process such as the generalized fokker - planck equation proposed in the context of the non - extensive statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "motility and diffusive patterns have also been investigated in protozoa  @xcite .",

    "motility is strongly related to cell viability in all flagellate kinetoplastid species and it is widely used as a proxy measurement for viability  @xcite .",
    "each protozoan specie has unique adaptations depending on the different living conditions .",
    "the investigation of the dynamics , diffusion and motion behavior of these microorganisms is an advance in the understanding of the microbial pathogenesis mechanism and in the field of diffusive patterns .",
    "however , a more complete and general understanding of motility patterns of these parasites is still lacking . to overcome this gap , we study the diffusive dynamics of causative agents of the neglected tropical diseases . by tracking the positions of these parasites , we present a complete characterization of their motility patterns . specifically , we show that the spread of the trajectories is superdiffusive for short - times and that probability distributions related to the radial positions differs from the predictions of the usual diffusion equation .",
    "we further verify that the velocity time series of individual trajectories have long - range correlations and are well approximated by a generalized gamma distribution .",

    "additional experiments considering different boundaries and thickness between the glass slide and the coverslip could further evaluate the effects of the walls on the motility of these protozoa .",
    "we have also calculated the average ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]c ) and standard deviation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]d ) of the velocities for each protozoan specie .",
    "it is worth noting that the velocities of the swimming microorganisms depend on the viscosity of the culture medium  @xcite and other values can be found in the literature due to different viscosity  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was found that the wildtype bloodstream form of the _ t. brucei _ can reach much higher velocities in the blood ( around @xmath19 m/s )  @xcite .",
    "_ trypanosoma _ spp use the motility as a tool to evade the immune cells and remove the bind between their surface and antibodies molecules . in the blood vessels , where the protozoa is adapted to survive ,",
    "red and white blood cells behave as support for the flagellum to propel the cell body .",
    "the same behavior is observed in more viscous liquids , justifying the increase in speed of the parasite in these environments  @xcite .",
    "other factors that affect the velocities include chemical cues , oxygen content , pressure , flow and confinement  @xcite . our results about the motility of _ leishmania _ spp promastigote and _ t. cruzi _",
    "epimastigotes suggest a very similar behavior profile .",
    "further details about these similarities are given in the results and discussion section .",
    "we start by characterizing the spreading of the trajectories of all protozoa . in order to do so",
    ", we have considered the time series of the magnitude of the position vector @xmath20 after subtracting its initial position @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "we thus measure the spreading by evaluating the time dependence of the variance of the centered radial position @xmath22 ^ 2 \\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{n_k(t)-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k(t ) } ( \\vec{r}_i(t)-\\langle \\vec{r}_i(t)\\rangle)^2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the average radial position and @xmath24 is the number of available trajectories for the @xmath25-th specie longer than @xmath13 steps ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . for usual diffusive processes",
    "the variance is expected to increase linearly on time , that is , @xmath26 .",
    "this usual behavior ( or the brownian motion ) is related to absence of memory along the particle trajectory as well as indicates a finite characteristic scale for the position increments and for the waiting times between flights . however , more complex diffusive processes often display deviations of this linear behavior . when this happens , a typical behavior for the variance is a power - law dependence on time  @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 corresponds to subdiffusion and @xmath29 to superdiffusion . in our case ,",
    "the evolution of the variances are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a , where is evident that the spreading of the protozoan trajectories occurs much faster than the expected by a brownian motion .",
    "we further observe an approximate power - law behavior over two decades of the temporal scale ( @xmath30 seconds ) .",
    "by least square fitting the log - log relationships ( @xmath31 versus @xmath32 ) , we find that values of @xmath33 are actually much larger than one . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b , @xmath33 ranges from @xmath34 for the _ l. braziliensis _ to @xmath35 for the _ t. brucei _ ; therefore , the four flagellate protozoa studied here display a strongly superdiffusive behavior for short - times .",
    "a similar exponent was observed for the motion of intracellular particles with @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "it is worth note that , biological swimmers can present some persistence related to their drive mechanism for short - times .",
    "we expect that the diffusion may eventually approach the usual regime for longer trajectories .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath33 obtained here represent a initial short - time behavior , and other regimes could be observed for longer trajectories .",
    "in fact , we note from fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a that the curves start to bend downwards for @xmath37s . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]c , we show the exponent @xmath33 calculated within a window of size 30 seconds centralized in @xmath38 as a function of @xmath38 , where we note that the values of @xmath33 decrease with @xmath38 and approach the value expected by the usual diffusion .",
    "-2.25in0 in    although all studied species showed superdiffusive spreading for short - times , we noticed a intriguing aspect of movement related to velocities and diffusion analysis for _ t. brucei_. this protozoan shows the smallest velocity and the greatest diffusion exponent in culture medium , suggesting that the _ t. brucei _ motility is more directional than the other protozoa species considered in this work .",
    "directional motility probably occurs because _ t. brucei _ is a free extracellular parasite and spreads across several tissues .",
    "trypomastigote forms of _ t. brucei _ are highly adapted to live in intercellular spaces  @xcite . during spreading in the host _",
    "t. brucei _ parasites penetrate between cells in the tissue where there are collagen fibers that can facilitate or hinder motion .",
    "for trypanosomes to reach the maximum forward velocity a specific density of cells is required . if the density of obstacles resembles collagen networks the protozoa swim backwards in order to avoid getting trapped  @xcite .",
    "these parasites have an entire antigen surface called variant surface glycoprotein ( vsg )  @xcite .",
    "the vsg is different among individuals in a population of _",
    "t. brucei _ and prevents specific binding with antibodies that could kill the parasites  @xcite .",
    "we hypothesize that the presence of surface molecules such as vsg s , which reduces the difficulty of the cell motion in its surroundings media , allows _ t. brucei _ parasite to diffuse faster .",
    "epimastigote forms of _ t. cruzi _ and promastigote forms of _ leishmania _ spp exhibit similar velocities and diffusion exponent .",
    "these forms are faster than the _ t. brucei _",
    "trypomastigote forms , have smaller diffusion exponent and have different strategies in this stage of the life - cycle . in the natural environment , _ t.",
    "cruzi _ epimastigote and _ leishmania _ spp promastigote do not need to travel long distances .",
    "specifically , epimastigote forms of _ t. cruzi _ must migrate to the midgut of the insect vector during a specific period of the life - cycle for proliferation  @xcite . in the case of promastigote forms of _ leishmania _ spp , they must be phagocytized by mammalian cells to complete their life - cycle . at this stage ,",
    "the _ leishmania _ parasites secrete a substance called promastigote secretory gel ( psg ) .",
    "the psg is a mucin - like gel and has been shown to be an important factor for the amastigote growth in the intracellular environment  @xcite .",
    "psg production seems to be responsible for the formation of agglomerates ( rosettes ) and could play a role as constraint for the diffusive motion  @xcite .",
    "overall , we suggest that changes in motility parameters and surface molecules that affect mechanical or physical constraints restricting the ability of cells to freely diffuse could significantly contribute to the virulence of these parasites",
    ".    another striking feature of diffusive processes is related to the probability distributions of the positions .",
    "for the usual diffusion with radial symmetry , this distribution can be obtained by solving the following differential equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath41 is the two - dimensional laplacian . by considering @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we can show that probability distribution of the radial position is @xmath44 it is worth noting that this solution leads to a linear behavior for the variance over time , that is , @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , the distributions given by the eq .",
    "[ eq : gaussnd ] are self - similar in time and collapse into a single curve , @xmath46 for the rescaled position @xmath47 .",
    "the usual diffusion equation ( eq .  [ eq : diff ] ) and its solution ( eq .  [ eq : gaussnd ] ) can be understood as a null model for the distributions of the radial positions of the protozoa if we assume that they behave as brownian particles , and deviations from this prediction is another indication of anomalous diffusion .",
    "we have calculated the time evolution of the empirical distributions of the radial positions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a , we note that these distributions shift toward positive values of @xmath48 while also become broaden over time @xmath13 . after considering the rescaled position @xmath47 , we observe that all distributions collapse into a single curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ) .",
    "this result demonstrates the empirical self - similar nature of the protozoa trajectories , but also reveals remarkable deviations between the empirical distributions and the expected by the usual diffusion equation ( gray dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b ) .    in an attempt to find a better description for these empirical distributions , we propose to replace the gaussian term in eq .",
    "[ eq : gaussnd ] by a stretched gaussian ( characterized by another parameter @xmath49 ) .",
    "specifically , we have considered the following probability distribution for the radial positions @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gamma function .",
    "we observe that @xmath52 recovers the usual gaussian term ; however , for @xmath53 the tail of this distribution goes to zero slower than the usual case , whereas for @xmath54 it decays faster .",
    "a similar generalization was proposed by richardson  @xcite in the context of atmospheric diffusion by considering a spatial - dependent diffusion coefficient , and is considered one of the first anomalous diffusion equation . the distribution given by the eq .",
    "[ eq : sg ] is also self - similar and for the rescaled radial position @xmath47 it can be written as @xmath55 we have thus adjusted eq .",
    "[ eq : sgc ] to the window average values of the empirical distributions via least squares fitting .",
    "the continuous lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b show that agreement is far from being perfect , but this generalization is a better description when compared with the distribution emerging from the usual diffusion equation ( eq .  [ eq : sgusual ] ) .",
    "therefore , the diffusive motion of the protozoa studied here displays simultaneously an anomalous ( enhanced ) scaling of variance @xmath56 as well as radial position distributions with much longer tails than the expected by brownian swimmers .",
    "the values of the best fitting parameters @xmath57 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c , where we observe that the _ l. amazonensis _ and the _ t. brucei _ display larger tails ( @xmath58 ) when compared with the _ l. braziliensis _ and the _ t. cruzi _ ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the values of @xmath57 should be related to values of @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the time dependence of the variance evaluated from eq .",
    "[ eq : sg ] is @xmath60 , leading to @xmath61 , a relationship that is roughly valid for the values @xmath57 obtained via the fitting procedure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) .",
    "-2.25in0 in    in order to further characterize the diffusive motion of the protozoa , we investigate the radial velocity time series @xmath62 related to the individual trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) .",
    "we first ask whether these time series have short or long - range correlations . to answer this question ,",
    "we have applied the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )  @xcite to these time series .",
    "this technique consists of four steps : @xmath63 first , we define the integrated profile @xmath64 , where @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the length of the @xmath14-th time series ; @xmath67 next , we split @xmath68 into @xmath69 non - overlapping segments of size @xmath70 ; @xmath71 for each segment , a local polynomial trend ( here we have used a linear function , but higher orders do not change our results ) is calculated and subtracted from @xmath68 , defining @xmath72 , where @xmath73 represents the local trend in the @xmath74-th segment ; @xmath75 finally , we calculate the root - mean - square fluctuation function @xmath76^{1/2}\\,,$ ] where @xmath77 is the mean square value of @xmath78 over the data in the @xmath74-th segment . if the velocity time series is self - similar , the fluctuation function @xmath79 presents a power - law dependence on the time scale @xmath70 , that is , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the hurst exponent . if @xmath82 the velocities are either uncorrelated or short - range correlated , whereas @xmath83 indicates that the time series is longe - range correlated .",
    "we have applied the above procedure to all velocity time series and a typical behavior for the fluctuation function @xmath79 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a . in this log - log plot ,",
    "we adjust a linear model for obtaining the hurst exponent @xmath81 , which is @xmath84 for the original time series and is close to @xmath85 for random shuffled versions of the time series .",
    "we calcule the hurst exponent for all time series and the average values for each protozoan is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b .",
    "these averages are practically indistinguishable from each other and indicate that the velocities of the protozoa have long - range correlations .",
    "furthermore , these velocities display a strong persistent behavior ( since @xmath86 ) , that is , positive increments in the velocities are followed by positive increments and negative increments are followed by negative increments much more frequently than by chance .",
    "we have also evaluated the distributions of @xmath81 for each protozoan specie for all individuals ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c ) , where we note that these distributions peak around @xmath86 and that they are quite overlapped .",
    "-2.25in0 in    another intriguing question is whether the velocity distributions of the protozoa exhibit a particular functional form ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5]a ) . in this case , the two - dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( or rayleigh distribution ) @xmath87 is a natural null model for the protozoan velocity ( @xmath88 is a parameter ) .",
    "this distribution represents the velocity of two - dimensional gas particles in thermodynamic equilibrium ( at a temperature @xmath88 ) and also emerges when evaluating the distribution of the magnitude of velocity vectors whose",
    "the components are uncorrelated and normally distributed ( with zero mean )  @xcite .",
    "this functional form has been found to describe quite well the velocities of humans in a very peculiar situation ( a _ mosh pit _ )  @xcite and it has also been used in the attempt of modeling the velocity distributions of _ hydra _ cells in a two - dimensional setup  @xcite .",
    "deviations from this model give clues about weather the velocities are correlated or not . in our case",
    ", we have tested the ( two - dimensional ) maxwell - boltzmann hypothesis by adjusting this distribution for each velocity time series and verifying the goodness of the fit via kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "this hypothesis was rejected for almost all velocity time series ( @xmath89 ) , a result that somehow agrees with the more complex behavior observed in the correlation analysis of these time series . aiming to find a better description for these empirical distributions ,",
    "we have considered the generalized gamma distribution @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the shape parameters and @xmath93 is a scale parameter . despite of being an _ ad hoc _ generalization , it is worth noting that this distribution recovers the two - dimensional maxwell - boltzmann ( for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , and it has been employed by several authors as a wind speed model  @xcite . for our data , the kolmogorov - smirnov test can not reject the generalized gamma hypothesis in about 50% of trajectories ( see  ) , an improved description when compared with the two - dimensional maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "furthermore , we have tested for the usual gamma ( eq .  [ eq : gamma ] with @xmath97 ) , log - normal , weibull and @xmath98-exponential distributions , finding that they do not outperform the generalized gamma description . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]b , we show the average values of the best fitting parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these values are practically indistinguishable among the four protozoa .",
    "an exception occurs for the _ t. brucei _ , which is characterized by a significantly smaller value of @xmath93 .",
    "this fact is a direct consequence of the small standard deviation observed for the velocities of _ t. brucei _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig:1]d ) , since the standard deviation of @xmath99 calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma ] is proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "we presented a description of the motility patterns of four trypanosomatid flagellate protozoa . by analyzing the time evolution of the positions of these protozoa",
