    "the balmer lines are the most well known and observed emission lines in astronomy , being both strong lines in the optical and ubiquitous as they arise from recombination to the @xmath4 level of the most common element , hydrogen .",
    "as the atomic structure of hydrogen is so well understood , the strength of the emission line fluxes can be well determined if the radiation field ionizing the hydrogen gas is known , and , importantly , the relative fluxes of the resulting hydrogen emission lines are only weakly dependent on the local conditions .",
    "given that the ratios are well determined , the difference between the measured ratios of the balmer lines and the intrinsic values expected can be used to determine the reddening of galaxies , or , more accurately , the ionized regions within them . in association with a attenuation / reddening - law and selective - to - total attenuation , @xmath5 , the reddening can then give the total attenuation of a galaxy ( e.g.   the oft used work of * ? ? ?",
    "this possibility of using the hydrogen emission lines , in particular the ratio of the two strongest balmer lines @xmath0  and @xmath1 , to measure the reddening and attenuation has been known and utilized for many years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* was one of the first mentions of the balmer decrement being affected by the path length through an absorbing medium ) .",
    "however , the accurate measurement of the balmer decrement ( i.e.  the ratio of @xmath0/@xmath1 ) requires the measurement of both the relatively weak @xmath1line and the continuum underneath it to distinguish the line .",
    "separation of the underlying continuum from the balmer emission lines is vital as the metal absorption lines and , especially , balmer absorption lines present in the spectrum of later - type stars act to weaken or hide the relative flux of the emission lines in the integrated spectra of galaxies . such was shown by @xcite , where the @xmath1  line was not observed in a selection of galaxies in low - resolution spectra ( @xmath6 ) from the the canada - france - redshift survey , but moderate resolution spectra ( @xmath7 ) revealed the weak @xmath1  lines hidden by both dust and absorption lines .",
    "the exposure times needed to obtain sufficient spectral resolution to distinguish the emission lines from the underlying stellar continuum of galaxies means that studies of the balmer decrement tend to be biased to high emission - line equivalent width objects . while this bias may not be a serious issue , with dustier , more attenuated objects tending to have higher specific star formation rates and thus higher emission line equivalent widths ( see e.g. *",
    "* ) , such biases do tend to limit samples for investigations of dust and star formation .",
    "this is especially so at higher redshifts where the high spectral resolution needed to resolve both the line and continuum limits surveys to the brightest objects .    even with moderate resolution spectra , the balmer emission line fluxes are still sensitive to the way the stellar absorption is accounted for , and this can be a substantial source of error , particularly for weak emission line sources .",
    "it is these issues that motivates us to examine the possibility of determining the decrement from the _ equivalent widths _ of the balmer emission lines .",
    "emission line equivalent widths do not require high resolution spectra to distinguish the line from the continuum , allowing the use of low resolution spectra , such as at r@xmath8 , enabling fainter objects or more objects to be observed for the same exposure time as high resolution spectra . even at only r@xmath9 , as will be available with the multi - object _ nirspec _ on jwst",
    ", the influence of @xmath1  on the interpretation of galaxy spectra can still be significant ( pacifici et al . , in prep ) , and the line is still detectable at a signal - to - noise @xmath10 for some of the brighter emission - line galaxies . the issue at these low resolutions ( i.e.  @xmath11 ) becomes one of distinguishing individual lines , such as [ nii]@xmath12  from @xmath0 , not detecting the lines .    to examine how the balmer line equivalent widths can be used to determine the balmer decrement we use the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss * ? ? ? * ) , which contains a large spectroscopic sample of emission line galaxies covering a wide range of galaxy types and properties , including attenuations .",
    "with such a wide range of galaxies , and reasonably high resolution spectra ( @xmath13 ) , the sdss provides the perfect sample for examining this issue . with the large number of sdss galaxies it is possible to obtain a statistically representative estimate for",
    "the correction factors needed ( i.e. the balmer absorption lines ) and thus determine the balmer decrement from equivalent widths alone .",
    "this method should be seen as complementary to the stellar spectral synthesis continuum fitting methods widely used in the analysis of galaxy spectra .",
    "codes such as platefit ( * ? ? ?",
    "* used for the determination of the stellar properties in the sdss mpa / jhu catalogue used here ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* applied this to lower resolution , higher redshift data in the vvds sample ) , ppxf @xcite , starlight @xcite , steckmap @xcite , and vespa @xcite , all use linear combinations of synthetic stellar population spectra ( such as from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to fit the full observed spectra of galaxies using various optimized maximum likelihood approaches .",
    "these codes have been created to extract the maximum possible information from galaxy spectra given degeneracies and noise ( see e.g. the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus are clearly the best approach when strong continuum is detected .",
    "yet the amount of possible information to be extracted reduces with both decreasing signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution .",
    "in addition , these methods are limited by the available spectral libraries , which may not cover the full parameter range needed to match the observed galaxies , and may have intrinsic issues , as we demonstrate here in an issue we discovered in the course of this paper .",
    "thus an empirical method as we explore here is fully complementary to the spectral synthesis methods used in most works .    in the following sections we introduce the balmer lines , both in absorption and emission (  [ sec : balmer ] ) ,",
    "the sdss emission - line galaxy sample([sec : sdsssample ] , provide a possible way to determine the balmer decrement from the equivalent widths([sec : ewbalmer ] ) , and finally also point out an interesting problem with the fitting of the stellar continuum in the sdss (  [ sec : balmer ] ) .",
    "the balmer emission lines in the interstellar medium arise predominantly from the recombination and subsequent cascade of electrons to the @xmath4 level of hydrogen . while collisional excitation can also contribute to the balmer line emission in hot media ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photoionization and recombination are the predominant energetic processes in most galaxies .",
    "as the atomic structure of hydrogen is so simple , it is possible to determine the exact electronic transition rates , and therefore the ratios of resulting emission lines from these transitions , as a function of physical conditions in the interstellar medium ( see @xcite for the original theory , with updated work by @xcite and @xcite , and treatments of this theory found in textbooks such as @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , two cases exist for which the balmer decrement has been determined over a range of temperatures and densities : case a and case b. case a assumes that an ionized nebula is optically thin to all lyman emission lines ( i.e.  lines emitted from transitions to the @xmath14 level of hydrogen ) , while case b assumes that a nebula is optically thick to all lyman lines greater than ly@xmath15 ( i.e. transitions to @xmath14 from levels @xmath16 and above ) , meaning these photons are absorbed and re - emitted as a combination of ly@xmath15 and higher order lines , such as the balmer lines .",
    "these two cases will lead to different intrinsic ratios for the balmer lines , with variations of the same order as temperature effects ( for other possible  cases  of emission which may occur , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while case b is typically assumed for determining intrinsic ratios , in reality the ratio in typical hii  regions lies between these two cases , and must be determined using radiative transfer codes such as  ( see eg * ? ? ? * ) or cloudy @xcite .",

    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we concentrate on emission line galaxies in this work , in particular galaxies with measurable balmer emission lines , we have placed cuts on the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the balmer emission lines using the uncertainties given by the mpa / jhu catalogue . as discussed on the website , the listed uncertainties are formal , and likely underestimates , thus we increase the uncertainty estimates on the emission lines to take into account continuum subtraction uncertainties by the factors listed on the web site determined by comparisons of duplicate observations within the sdss sample . specifically for the balmer lines , we multiply the line flux uncertainty estimates by a factor of 1.882 . from the full sdss emission line galaxy sample",
    "we define three galaxy samples depending on the lines and ratios being examined ; sn(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) , sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19 ) , and sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) , where we require a s / n@xmath21 in two or more of the four strongest balmer lines ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath19 , & @xmath20 ) . the s",
    "/ n cuts are dominated by the weakest line in each sample due to the strong decrease in relative flux for the higher order lines , thus the inclusion of each higher order line biases the samples to higher equivalent widths of the @xmath0  emission line . as shown in figure [ fig : ewha_wcuts ] , beginning from the full galaxy sample of sdss dr7 ( @xmath2 928,000 galaxies ) , approximately half are emission line galaxies ( @xmath2 510,000 , as measured by the presence of @xmath0  in emission ) , with a broad spread of equivalent widths peaking at @xmath22  ( as measured from the local continuum , not corrected for stellar absorption ) . as each higher order balmer line",
    "is included , the sample rapidly decreases and is biased to higher equivalent widths , with the sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) sample limited to @xmath2120,000 galaxies with ew(@xmath0)@xmath23 , with a distribution peaking at 32(sn(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) has @xmath2392,000 galaxies , while sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19 ) has @xmath2241,000 galaxies ) . as the emission line ew(@xmath0 ) in a galaxy spectrum can be considered a proxy for the specific star formation rate ( the current star formation rate relative to the total stellar mass , ssfr = sfr / m@xmath24 ) of a galaxy , the bias in ew(@xmath0 ) means a bias to more `` starforming '' galaxies , which means a bias to lower - mass , lower - metallicity , bluer galaxies as shown in previous works @xcite .",
    "this bias needs to be kept in mind when considering the diagrams and analysis in this work .",
    "figure [ fig : ewha_wcuts ] also reveals the limitation of low - resolution spectroscopy in finding all emission line sources , and thus the limitation of applicability of the method we explore here .",
    "approximately 5% of the sn(@xmath0 ) sample , and even 0.7% of the sn(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) sample , actually have ew(@xmath0 ) less than zero ( i.e.  the emission line is lost in the stellar absorption feature ) .",
    "these sources would never be picked up as emission line galaxies in low - resolution spectra , and the use of an emission - line equivalent width balmer decrement to determine the attenuation would return spurious results .",
    "emission line equivalent widths for the samples considered in this work .",
    "all four histograms are normalized to their peak value , with the total number of galaxies in each sample listed in the key in the upper left .",
    "the solid histogram shows all emission line galaxies in sdss dr7 ( defined by the presence of @xmath0  in emission ) , and the three dashed curves show the distributions of samples defined by s / n cuts in the balmer lines ( as labelled in the upper left ) considered in this work . ]    note that we have not included any cuts on redshift or the type of emission - line galaxy as in previous works on sdss emission line galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such redshift cuts are necessary to make certain that aperture effects do not play a part in the derived galaxy properties ( by sampling only a small , biased part of the galaxy , as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to prevent luminosity biases at the higher redshifts .",
    "yet as we care only for the derived balmer emission line fluxes and stellar equivalent widths these issues do not strongly affect our findings .",
    "separating emission - line galaxies by class ( i.e.  star - forming or active galactic nucleus dominated ) is necessary when examining the structure of the forbidden emission lines ( e.g. [ oiii]@xmath25 ) which depend strongly on the dominant ionization mechanism in the gas ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and when comparing physical galaxy properties with emission line properties ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , as discussed in the previous section , the relative strength of the balmer lines depend only weakly on local conditions , and will vary little in their intrinsic ratios between being photoionized by agn or by ob stars ( i.e.  @xmath0/@xmath1  should be @xmath26 in star - forming galaxies and @xmath27 in galaxies ionized purely by an agn ) .",
    "thus , while this difference is significant and will have some bearing on the work in this paper , it is secondary to the effects of dust attenuation .",
    "only when collisional heating dominates the atomic gas and the excitation of hydrogen , such as in shocks or clouds in hot gas , can the intrinsic ratios be significantly different ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these processes are not expected to dominate most galaxies within our sample . an additional reason to include agn is that , in accordance with our main aim , separating out the contribution of agn from lower s / n samples may prove problematic as the weak diagnostic lines become lost within the noise .",
    "approximately 2% of the full sdss sample considered here are duplicate observations of galaxies ( i.e.  @xmath28% of the sample are pairs ) .",
    "we have not removed these from the sample so as to include the intrinsic scatter due to observational uncertainties in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the issue of simply using directly the equivalent widths of the balmer lines as proxies for the line fluxes when calculating the balmer decrement can be seen in figure [ fig : ew_hahb ] which shows the spread of the equivalent width based balmer decrement ( @xmath29ew(@xmath0)/ew(@xmath1)@xmath30 $ ] ) against the `` true '' balmer decrement determined from the stellar continuum - subtracted line fluxes ( log(@xmath0/@xmath1 ) ) for the sn(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) sample .",
    "both the ew balmer decrement and the flux balmer decrement have been normalised to the intrinsic ratio of 2.86 , appropriate for a low density gas of @xmath31k .",
    "one of the first obvious issues to be corrected for is the variation of the underlying stellar continuum between the @xmath0  and @xmath1wavelengths . in the left diagram of figure [ fig : ew_hahb ] , we show the distribution of @xmath29ew(@xmath0)/ew(@xmath1)@xmath30 $ ] , uncorrected for the continuum flux variation , while on the right the more accurate form of the ew balmer decrement is used : @xmath29ew(@xmath0)/ew(@xmath1)@xmath30 + \\log[{\\rm f}_{\\lambda}({\\ensuremath{\\mbox{h}\\alpha}})/{\\rm f}_{\\lambda}({\\ensuremath{\\mbox{h}\\beta}})]$ ] , where @xmath32 is the continuum flux at @xmath0 , determined from a 200 pixel median smoothing of the emission - line subtracted continuum .    when uncorrected for the underlying continuum variation there is a clear systematic offset of the ew balmer decrement from the 1:1 relation of @xmath33 dex .",
    "correcting for the continuum variation removes this offset , yet a significant spread remains .",
    "this spread is due to the effect of the stellar balmer absorption features . without these , ew(@xmath0)@xmath34 should be , by definition , the flux of the line .",
    "the colors in figure [ fig : ew_hahb]a indicate the median @xmath20  absorption index ( @xmath20@xmath35 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sample in each pixel . as the figure shows ,",
    "while the absolute strength of the stellar balmer absorption features does play a part in the observed offset of the sdss galaxies ew balmer decrements , the dominant mechanism for the offset and spread is the _ relative _ strength of the stellar absorption features to the emission lines .",
    "this can be seen by the distribution of the equivalent width of the @xmath0  emission line indicated by the colours in figure [ fig : ew_hahb]b , where there is a clear gradient of decreasing ew(@xmath0 ) with increasing offset from the line .",
    "as the emission lines become weaker overall , the stellar absorption features , which are @xmath3610  as discussed in section [ sec : balmer ] , obscure a greater fraction of @xmath1  relative to @xmath0  and therefore lead to a larger offset .",

    "one possible approach when faced with low resolution spectra is to assume that the absorption equivalent width is constant for both balmer lines across the whole sample .",
    "while figure [ fig : ew_balmer ] clearly shows that the absorption ew is _ not _ the same for all the balmer lines , it provides a first step when information is sparse and uncertainties large .",
    "when a constant balmer absorption correction @xmath41 is assumed for both ew(@xmath0 ) and ew(@xmath1 ) , a correction factor of @xmath42  is determined when the offset of the sdss galaxies ew balmer decrements to the measured @xmath0/@xmath1  ratios is minimized using an error - based weighting .",
    "the inclusion of this simple correction factor improves the situation when compared to that shown in figure [ fig : ew_hahb ] , but with a still significant scatter of @xmath43 dex around the expected value and an extended tail of objects towards lower values .",

    "]    when split into bins of different ew(@xmath0 ) , more accurate fits with differing correction factors are obtained . in figure",

    "the lowest ew(@xmath0 ) ( figure [ fig : binewfix]a ) sample appears by eye to be slightly offset form the line .",
    "a reasonable hypothesis is that this offset arises due to our simple assumption of a constant correction @xmath41 to both ew(@xmath0 ) and ew(@xmath1 ) , whereas it is clear from [ fig : ew_balmer ] that the absorption ew(@xmath0 ) is typically less than the absorption ew of @xmath1  by approximately a factor of 0.6 on average .",
    "however , changing the correction factor of ew(@xmath0 ) to @xmath60 and redoing the fit does not remove this offset . on closer examination",
    "it is clear that this offset is due to a biasing of the fit to the high signal - to - noise data , which predominantly occur at high values of the @xmath0/@xmath1  ratio due to measurement biases ( i.e.   there is a clear gradient in ew(@xmath0 ) from top to bottom in figure [ fig : binewfix]a ) . assuming uniform weighting for the fit ( i.e.  ignoring the errors in ews ) gives a value of @xmath61 , well within the large uncertainties for @xmath41 . for the other figures , assuming an offset correction factor for ew(@xmath0 ) of @xmath60 , results in @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath63  in terms of increasing ews , with similar dispersion around the relations .",

    "while figure [ fig : binewfix ] demonstrates that it is possible to determine the balmer decrement to some accuracy from emission line equivalent widths , the determination of the correction is dependent upon the measurement of three quantities ; ew(@xmath0 ) , ew(@xmath1 ) , and the flux ratio , @xmath38 . while the former two will be observable in strong emission line galaxies at high redshift , the flux ratio may prove problematic to measure from spectra .",

    "the three different lines overplotted show the effect of three different attenuation laws commonly assumed in the analysis of galaxies .",
    "for all three lines , the symbols indicates steps of 0.5 in @xmath76 , up to @xmath87 .",
    "the @xcite law ( od94 ) is an updated version of the @xcite fit to the average extinction law in the galaxy , thus least representative of the integrated emission from the sdss galaxies , which will suffer attenuation due to the mixture of emitting sources and absorbing medium .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite and can be seen in figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] , the use of a foreground dust screen with galactic extinction is indistinguishable from the other laws , especially given the uncertainty within the sdss sample .",
    "we assume a total to selective @xmath88-band extinction of @xmath89 , the average value in our galaxy .    the @xcite attenuation law ( cal00 )",
    "was obtained from the continuum and balmer decrement of local actively star - forming galaxies , thus matching the high ew(@xmath0 ) galaxies in the sample .",
    "note that as only ratios are analysed here , the difference between the colour excess ( @xmath90 ) of the stellar continuum and nebular lines noted by calzetti et al .",
    "is effectively scaled out .",
    "the @xmath5 used here is 4.05 , as given by @xcite from the comparison of the observed infrared flux to that predicted from the obscuration of the optical - ultraviolet light .",
    "the @xcite attenuation law ( cf00 ) is a more simple , empirical law put forward to allow for the different colour excesses and attenuations observed by @xcite between the nebular emission lines and stellar continuum .",
    "it breaks the attenuation into two components ; the ` diffuse ism ' component that describes the effective obscuration of all stars in a galaxy by the diffuse dust , and the ` birth cloud ' component that describes the additional extinction suffered by the hiiregions from which the nebular emission lines arise , giving @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the exponent of @xmath93 for the diffuse ism was empirically derived by @xcite with a comparison of nearby galaxies , while the @xmath94 exponent for the birth clouds was chosen to match the extinction within our own galaxy .",
    "the parameter @xmath95 indicates the fraction of the attenuation suffered by the nebular lines by each component .",
    "we assume @xmath96 here , as used by @xcite and @xcite in their analyses of sdss galaxies .",
    "there are three things of note to take from figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] : one , given enough precision in the data , the sdss galaxies should be able to distinguish between these three different attenuation laws , and provide an answer on which law is best ( or least bad ) to apply to an ensemble of galaxies .",
    "such work has been done before for comparing galactic extinction laws using planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "note that the different @xmath5 between the cal00 and od94 laws is what causes the difference in expected @xmath0/@xmath1  for the same @xmath76 , while the cf00 and cal00 have similar @xmath76 as determined from @xmath0/@xmath1 , but not from @xmath19/@xmath1 .",
    "two , that the scatter of the sdss galaxies is large around the three laws , preventing this possibility , though this scatter is not significant when compared to the median uncertainty as shown by the error bars .",
    "third , and most importantly , while the slope of sdss galaxies matches that given by the attenuation laws , _ there is a systematic offset of the sdss galaxies when compared to all three attenuation laws_. this offset is significant , and can not be explained by assuming more extreme ( and therefore less likely ) attenuation laws or by assuming large values of @xmath5 , as the zero point itself appears to be offset .",
    "neither can this situation be remedied by assuming different values for the unattenuated balmer ratios . as discussed in section [ sec : balmer ] ,",
    "the intrinsic balmer emission - line ratios are sensitive to the temperature of the ionized gas from which they arise , and , more weakly , to the density of the gas as well the inset in figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] shows a close up of the zero point of figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] , i.e.  galaxies with little or no attenuation . over this",
    "are plotted 3 symbols indicating the position where the zero point would be for 3 different average hii  region temperatures ; 5,000k , 10,000k ( assumed within the figure ) , and 20,000k .",
    "all assume case b ratios , and a typical hii  gas density of @xmath97@xmath18 .",
    "these 3 temperatures encompass the range of temperatures expected , with typical solar metallicity hii  regions having t@xmath988,000k .",
    "what this figure demonstrates is that the variation in intrinsic balmer ratios is small relative to both the effects of attenuation and the observed offset , and that the variation in intrinsic ratios is in the same sense as that due to the effects of attenuation ( as shown by the @xcite law ) , thus the intrinsic ratio can not be the cause of the offset .",
    "a possible cause for this offset can be found when the mpa / jhu dr4 catalogue is examined instead . using the same sn cuts on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath19 , figure [ fig : dr4hahbhghb ]",
    "shows the same plot as figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] for the dr4 sample . in most ways",
    "this figure is exactly the same ( as it should be ) , except in two respects : the dr4 sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19 ) sample only has @xmath2160,000 galaxies in the sample compared to the @xmath2240,000 galaxies in the dr7 sample , visible in both the number density ( colours ) and in the scatter , and the dr4 sample does not have the offset with respect to the attenuation laws seen in figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] .    , except using the sdss dr4 mpa / jhu catalogue . the same sn cuts on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath19",
    "are applied , with @xmath2160,000 galaxies in the sample . ]    as mentioned in section [ sec : sdsssample ] , the major difference between the dr4 and dr7 line fluxes from the mpa / jhu catalogues is the version of the galaxev models used for the continuum fits . in some respects",
    "the difference seen in the figures is surprising , as the median @xmath99 of the fits to the continuum in dr7 is reduced compared to the dr4 fits , from @xmath100 for dr4 to @xmath101 for dr7 , suggesting a much better fit to the spectra .",
    "the issue most likely lies within the @xmath1  line region , as an offset in the @xmath1  line flux would also explain the increasing offset at higher ( @xmath0/@xmath1 ) between the sdss galaxies and the attenuation laws , and this region has been observed to be mismatched between models and the spectra of some globular clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this difference in slope is more clearly seen in figure [ fig : dr7_avhahb]a where we have rotated and scaled figure [ fig : hahbhghb ] to the @xmath76 plane using the attenuation law of @xcite , where the offset from the @xmath102-axis is more clearly seen .",
    "similar results are seen if another attenuation law is used . in this frame , the @xmath44-axis is the offset from the expected ( @xmath19/@xmath1 ) ratio based on the @xmath76 as determined by the ( @xmath0/@xmath1 ) ratio .    , but rotated to @xmath76 axes using the attenuation law of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath102-axis is the @xmath76 as measured from the ( @xmath0/@xmath1 ) ratio , while the @xmath44-axis is the offset from the expected ( @xmath19/@xmath1 ) ratio based on this @xmath76 .",

    "this is what we have done in figure [ fig : dr7_avhahb]b , where we have added 0.35  to the emission line equivalent width ( i.e.  `` true '' @xmath1=@xmath1 + 0.35f@xmath103(@xmath1 ) ) .",
    "the correction of 0.35  was determined by minimizing the offset from the calzetti law ( this value depends only weakly on the choice of attenuation law ) .",
    "this means that the stellar absorption equivalent width of @xmath1  is systematically underestimated by 0.35  in the cb08 continuum fits to dr7 sdss spectra .",
    "the fact that this 0.35  underestimation is systematic is interesting , as we would expect that any error would depend on the strength of the balmer features , either measured through the @xmath20@xmath35 or the emission line equivalent widths , both of which do correlate with @xmath0/@xmath1  as seen in figure [ fig : ew_hahb ] , yet no correlation is observed .",
    "what the underlying cause of this systematic underestimation is unknown , yet it must be taken into consideration when determining the @xmath76 from the balmer decrement in the sdss dr7 mpa / jhu catalogue .",
    "it is possible that this issue arises due to the misclassification of the spectral resolution of the miles library ( as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the implementation in the cb08 code , but this issue is now known and currently under investigation .",
    "this investigation goes beyond the scope of the work presented here but we note that the models used here are early versions of the cb08 library and these issues are expected to be solved within the to - be - published models . when the new @xmath76 is calculated from the @xmath0/@xmath1  ratio including the systematic 0.35  offset ( using e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* law ) , a mean difference of @xmath1040.07 magnitudes is found with the uncorrected @xmath76 estimates , increasing slightly at higher @xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that previous dr7 @xmath76 estimates , such as in @xcite , are overestimated by this value .",
    "similarly this 0.35  correction must be included in our ew balmer decrement ( equation [ eqn : ewhahb ] ) leading to a new equation , @xmath105 which more closely matches our expectations of different stellar absorption equivalent widths between @xmath0  and @xmath1 . for weaker emission line galaxies ,",
    "the offset would be smaller than 4.1 , as shown in figure [ fig : binewfix ] and discussed at the end of section [ sec : ewbalmer ] .",
    "while examining the issue in @xmath1 , a similar issue was found for @xmath20that we present here as a curiosity . when @xmath20/@xmath0  versus @xmath19/@xmath0is plotted , using the sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) sample of sdss galaxies and avoiding the problematic @xmath1  line , the tight correlation between these two ratios , matching closely that expected from the attenuation by dust .",
    "however , upon closer examination , a systematic offset is observed between the galaxies and attenuation laws . as in the previous subsection on @xmath1 ,",
    "the offset is clearer when rotated to the @xmath76 plane , which is what we show in figure [ fig : avhgha ] , where the @xmath102-axis is the @xmath76 determined from @xmath19/@xmath0  using the @xcite law , with the @xmath44-axis the offset from this @xmath76 when determined from the @xmath20/@xmath0  ratio .",
    "the median offset is @xmath106 for most of the @xmath76 range shown here , meaning that the @xmath76 determined from @xmath20/@xmath0  is lower than that determined from @xmath19/@xmath0 .",
    "the offset is seen for all attenuation laws considered here .    /@xmath0",
    "versus @xmath19/@xmath0  for the sn(@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) sample of sdss dr7 galaxies ( @xmath2121,00 objects ) . as in figure [ fig : dr7_avhahb ] , the figure is rotated and scaled to the @xmath76 plane as determined from the @xcite law , indicated by the straight line .",
    "the number of galaxies in each pixel is indicated by colours ( as labelled ) , with pixels with less than 5 galaxies not shown . ]",
    "more importantly , the offset is also observed in the dr4 sample , though with greater uncertainty due to low number statistics . as with the @xmath1  line there appears to be no correlation of the offset with emission line equivalent widths , or stellar age determinants like h@xmath107 or the d@xmath108 index ( see * ? ? ? * for definitions of these indices ) .",
    "neither does it appear to be correlated with @xmath0/@xmath1  or other emission line or attenuation tracers .",
    "thus , due to the lack of difference between dr4 and dr7 , the strong ew bias of the sample ( as shown in figure [ fig : ewha_wcuts ] ) , and the fact that the uncertainty is dominated by the @xmath20  line , it is still not known what exactly causes this offset .",
    "it is most likely an issue due to the underlying continuum , but an investigation into the stellar models goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "thus we present this issue for now as a curiosity and a cautionary note of the level of systematic uncertainties in determining weak line fluxes from the sdss sample .",
    "we have examined the possibility of using equivalent widths of the balmer emission lines to determine the balmer decrement , and hence attenuation , of a galaxy . using the sloan digital sky survey we were able to determine a statistically representative relation between the continuum - subtracted balmer emission line flux ratio and the equivalent widths ( ew ) of the balmer emission - lines combined with a rest - frame colour , correcting for the effects of the stellar absorption features : @xmath109 for galaxies with ew(@xmath0)@xmath110 , with a scatter of @xmath111 dex , or 0.4 mag in @xmath3 , indicating the possible variation for individual objects . for galaxies with ew(@xmath0)@xmath77  smaller correction factors ( 3.5 for ew(@xmath0 ) , 3.8 for ew(@xmath1 ) ) should be used .",
    "however , given the scatter at low ew values , the equation above can be used above for all galaxies allowing for a much greater uncertainty in the final balmer ratio or @xmath3 determined .",
    "in addition , by comparing the balmer decrement ( @xmath0/@xmath1  versus @xmath19/@xmath1 ) we discovered that the @xmath1  emission line equivalent width ( and hence flux ) is underestimated by @xmath112  in the jhu / mpa dr7 sdss database , due to an issue in the @xmath1  region of the 2008 version of the charlot & bruzual stellar population synthesis code galexev .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the attenuation of the sdss galaxies of 0.07 magnitudes in @xmath3 assuming a @xcite attenuation law .",
    "finally , we also discovered a strange offset in the @xmath20  emission line fluxes observable in both the dr4 and dr7 releases of the mpa / jhu database which we present both as a curiosity and as a warning on the underlying issues in interpreting weak - line emission lines in a statistical sample",
