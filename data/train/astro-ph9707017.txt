    "the recent development of nir observational astronomy , as well as the progress of the theory of stellar evolution ( overshooting , nuclear rates , winds , opacities , see maeder & meynet ( 1989 ) ; chiosi ( 1986 ) ) , notably of the evolved phases ( groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) up to the pagb terminal phases ( blcker 1995 ) , put new constraints on the evolution of galaxies",
    ". the uv - optical range of currently star - forming galaxies is dominated by young stars , and results of models limited to this domain are unable to determine the past star formation history . to break this degeneracy ,",
    "the nir emission of the bulk of giants is worthy to be examined as a meaningful indicator of mass and age .",
    "moreover , the nir light is less obscured by dust than at shorter wavelengths and has proved very useful in the spectral analysis of dusty starbursts ( lanon et rocca - volmerange 1996 ) . following star formation history over a long timescale thus needs a continuity of the wavelength range .",
    "that continuity is also necessary to analyze distant galaxies at large redshift ranges in the deepest galaxy counts . from the long series of models compared by arimoto ( 1996 ) and charlot ( 1996 ) at the crete meeting , most current models agree in the visible .",
    "however , none of them is published in the nir by leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , possibly because they show a flux deficit from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of early - type galaxies ( arimoto 1996 )",
    ". the poor knowledge of the atmospheric parameters of cold stars dominating the nir and the rapid evolution of the latest phases are evident difficulties for the modeling of nir emission .",
    "another difficulty is the connection of the nir stellar emission to the visible at about 1 @xmath0 m , where cold stars of @xmath6 2000 to 3000 k peak .",
    "moreover , in that domain , only a few data are available because receivers in the optical as in the nir have minimal sensitivity .",
    "our main goal is to build a new atlas of evolving standard synthetic spectra for the types of the hubble sequence .",
    "we present here uv to nir energy distributions for 8 spectral galaxy types .",
    "evolutionary parameters are constrained by fitting synthetic spectra at @xmath1 on integrated spectra and colors of nearby galaxies .",
    "the choice of templates requires a peculiar attention to aperture effects and a significant identification of hubble types .",
    "these criteria have led us to use statistical color samples , because of the lack of significant spectral templates in the nir wavelength range .",
    "the samples of optical and nir data show however a high dispersion , which is partly observational , but is also due to uneven star formation histories leading to an intrinsic scatter of colors for a given morphological type .",
    "this makes it difficult to identify observational templates .",
    "a first application of pegase solves the puzzling question of the bright galaxy counts .",
    "the slope at bright magnitudes is shown to be in agreement with recent _ multispectral _ observations of gardner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , excluding the strong evolution of giant galaxies at low redshift advocated by maddox et al .",
    "( 1990 ) from their steep counts . moreover , the normalization of the luminosity function is in accordance with the high value of marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ modele ] ,",
    "we present our model , the algorithm , the stellar library and other related data , the evolutionary tracks , the nebular emission and finally the extinction model . in section  [ histoire ]",
    ", we examine the star formation history for starbursts and evolved galaxies and propose evolutionary scenarios fitted on uv to nir observations of galaxies of the hubble sequence . in section  [ comptages ] , we check that the evolution of our standard scenario is realistic by comparison with bright galaxy counts , and we finally discuss in the conclusion the advantages and limitations of the model .",
    "the two historical models of tinsley ( 1972 ) and searle et al .",
    "( 1973 ) computed , respectively , the photometric evolution of galaxies from isomass stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones . when applied to the same stellar evolutionary model and with similar input data ( stellar spectra library , bolometric corrections  ) , both methods should give equivalent results , so that output differences must arise from deficient algorithms .",
    "refined algorithms recently improved to conserve the released energy and the stability of outputs without suffering any degradation by smoothing methods are presented here .",
    "the stellar library is improved in the visible and the uv and is coherently extended by using nir spectra and colors of stars on a significant cover of the hr diagram .",
    "evolutionary tracks of the geneva and padova groups may be used up to the beginning of thermal pulses and are completed with stellar models of the final phases up to the pagb phase .",
    "the nebular emission , computed as in guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange ( 1987 ) ( hereafter grv ) , is extended to the nir and a new modeling of extinction in elliptical galaxies is proposed .",
    "although the principle of spectral evolutionary synthesis is simple , computational problems and erroneous results may be caused by unoptimized algorithms .",
    "the monochromatic flux of a galaxy at age @xmath7 and wavelength @xmath8 may be written @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) at time @xmath11 in @xmath12 per time and mass units , @xmath13 the initial mass function ( imf ) defined in the interval @xmath14 $ ] and normalized to @xmath15 , and @xmath16 the monochromatic flux of a star with initial mass @xmath17 at wavelength @xmath8 and at age @xmath18 since the zero age main sequence ( zams ) ( null if @xmath18 exceeds the lifetime duration ) .",
    "a simple discretization of both integrals leads however to oscillations of the emitted light ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ) . mainly due to the rapid evolutionary phases such as tp - agb or massive red supergiants",
    ", they can be solved with a sufficient time resolution requiring substantial computer times ( lanon & rocca - volmerange 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , oscillations are observed at any time @xmath7 that a stellar population of mass @xmath17 moves off from a stellar phase before the subsequent population of mass @xmath19 reaches the same evolutionary phase . resulting oscillations",
    "present a real difficulty in simulating instantaneous bursts , while they are artificially smoothed with continuous star formation laws . to avoid that problem ,",
    "one possibility is to discretize only one of the two integrals . for example ( isomass method , discretization of the integral on mass ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 is sufficiently small that equivalent phases of consecutive masses overlap .",
    "an alternative is to discretize the other integral on time ( isochrone method ) : @xmath26 with @xmath27 short enough , so that consecutive isochrones @xmath28 have evolved little .",
    "both algorithms have been checked by us to give identical results . in the following ,",
    "we prefer , unlike in our previous models , the isochrone method partly because isochrones are directly comparable to color - magnitude diagrams of star clusters and also for computational reasons .",
    "although the libraries of synthetic stellar spectra become more and more reliable , the physics of the cold stars dominating in the nir ( @xmath29 to @xmath30 ) , notably the blanketing effects that lead to color temperatures very different to the effective ones ( lanon & rocca - volmerange 1992 ) , is at the moment not taken sufficiently into account to build synthetic spectra of galaxies .",
    "for this reason , as in our previous models , we prefer to adopt observational libraries when possible and synthetic spectra otherwise .",
    "after reduction of various photometric systems to the glass filters , standard optical and infrared colors were derived by bessel & brett ( 1988 ) for stars later than b8v and g0iii . we have used these colors to derive fluxes at mean wavelengths of the infrared filters for the stars of our uv - optical library and fitted cubic splines to these fluxes .",
    "hotter star spectra are extended in the nir with a blackbody at @xmath31 .",
    "the color temperatures derived in lanon & rocca - volmerange ( 1992 ) could be used instead , but it should make no significant difference since , at these temperatures the blackbody is used in the rayleigh - jeans wavelength range .",
    "a stellar library observed with a better resolution in the nir with the fts / cfht is in preparation . in the mid - infrared ( @xmath32 )",
    ", we use the analytic extension of engelke ( 1992 ) for stars colder than 6000 k. for m giants , which strongly dominate in the nir , we use the spectra of fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) with the temperatures they provide .",
    "their good resolution in spectral types is essential since @xmath33 increases very rapidly with decreasing temperature .",
    "the library from the far - uv to the nir respects the effective temperature of any spectral type all along the wavelength range .",
    "anomalous stellar spectra and wrong identifications of spectral types in the published libraries may produce erroneous colors and spectra of galaxies .",
    "for this reason , optical spectra were selected from the library of gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) according to the following procedure : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 color - color diagrams for all the stars of the library were plotted .",
    "least square polynomials were fitted to the points , and we only selected stars in good agreement with the fits .",
    "effective temperatures were derived from @xmath37 according to the calibration from straiys ( 1992 ) , except for m dwarfs , the temperatures of which were calculated from @xmath38 according to bessel ( 1995 ) . in the far - uv ( 1230 - 3200  ) ,",
    "stellar spectra are extracted from the iue esa / nasa librairies ( heck et al .",
    "1984 ) and , after correction for extinction with the standard law of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) , connected to the visible .",

    "anomalous spectra near 2000    ( especially o stars ) due to the bump of the extinction curve have been eliminated , as well as those in strong disagreement with the slope of the uv continuum of kurucz ( 1992 ) for the corresponding temperature . in the extreme - uv ( 220 - 1230  )",
    ", we complete our spectra with kurucz ( 1992 ) models for @xmath41 .",
    "the models of clegg & middlemass ( 1987 ) are finally used at all wavelengths for stars hotter than 50000 k. our stellar library is available in the aas cd - rom or on our anonymous account .",
    "we compute the bolometric corrections from fluks et al .",

    "( 1996 ) for very hot stars or else the values tabulated by straiys ( 1992 ) .",
    "the bolometric corrections that we compute from our spectra , since only a negligible flux should be emitted outside our wavelength range , are in good agreement with the above values from the literature , making us confident that our identification in @xmath31 is correct and that the junctions between the uv , optical and nir domains are valid .",
    "stars are followed from the zams to the final phases ( supernovae or white dwarfs according to their masses ) , including the tp - agb , fundamental to model nir spectra , and pagb phases . to check the sensitivity of spectral synthesis to evolutionary tracks",
    ", we compare the solar metallicity tracks of bressan et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( hereafter `` padova '' ) to those of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) extended by charbonnel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( hereafter `` geneva '' ) .",
    "the `` padova '' tracks overshoot for masses @xmath42 and use a higher ratio of the overshooting distance to the pressure scale height and down to lower masses than geneva tracks , which include overshooting above @xmath43 only .",
    "both sets use the opal opacities ( iglesias et al .",
    "92 ) , similar mixing lengths , helium contents ( 0.28 for padova and 0.30 for geneva ) and mass loss rates .",
    "we do not consider other metallicities , since these tracks already lead to significant discrepancies ( see [ tracescomp ] ) which make the comparison of observed and synthetic spectra uncertain .",
    "both sets go up to the beginning of the tp - agb for intermediate and low - mass stars and have been prolonged by tp - agb using typical luminosities and evolutionary timescales from groenewegen & de jong ( 1993 ) for stars less massive than @xmath44 .",
    "the pagb models of schnberner ( 1983 ) and blcker ( 1995 ) , supported by observations of planetary nebulae ( tylenda & stasiska 1994 ) , are finally connected to the tracks .",
    "whatever the algorithm used , interpolation between tracks requires the identification of the corresponding points .",
    "the interpolation algorithm adopted here aims to conserve the released energy along any track . for padova models ,",
    "sets of evident equivalent points are selected on consecutive mass tracks .",
    "considering now such points @xmath45 and @xmath46 of track @xmath47 and the corresponding ones @xmath48 and @xmath49 of track @xmath50 , we may build a new track @xmath51 replacing track @xmath50 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "except when otherwise stated , we use padova tracks with their complements to the latest phases and to low mass stars , because of their higher resolution in mass and time and because geneva tracks may not be interpolated after 16 gyr , since post - helium flash evolution is not available in the @xmath60 track .",
    "gaseous nebulae are assumed to be optically thick in lyman lines , according to case b recombination , the most likely for isolated nebulae ( osterbrock 1989 ) . as in our previous models ,",

    "we take @xmath68 , in agreement with the values obtained by degioia - eastwood ( 1992 ) for hii regions in the lmc .",
    "the extinction by dust which affects the sed of galaxies depends on the spatial distribution of dust and stars and on its composition , narrowly related to the metallicity @xmath69 of the ism . the optical depth @xmath70 is related as in grv to the column density of hydrogen @xmath71 and the metallicity .    the metallicity evolution @xmath72 is computed from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) snii models without the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "since the extinction is described as a function of the global metallicity , we neglect the yields of snia and intermediate and low mass stars .",

    ", we must specify the distribution of stars and dust .",
    "since it is more appropriate to describe the inner regions of ellipticals , which are the more affected by extinction , we prefer to use a king model for stars rather than a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the distribution of dust in spheroids is poorly known .",
    "frhlich ( 1982 ) proposed to describe the density of dust as a power of the density of stars : @xmath86 , and found @xmath87 for two ellipticals of the coma cluster .",
    "witt et al . ( 1992 ) and wise & silva ( 1996 ) suggest @xmath88 .",
    "values @xmath89 would lead to strong color gradients in ellipticals that are not observed ( silva & wise 1996 ) .",
    "tsai & mathews ( 1995 ) obtain from the x - ray profile of three ellipticals that the distribution of gas is proportional to the square root of the starlight profile . assuming a constant dust to gas ratio in these galaxies , we find once again @xmath90 .",
    "we keep this value in the following and estimate the amount of extinction for the parameters of the model  ( b ) of tsai & mathews ( 1995 ) which corresponds to a @xmath84 galaxy .",
    "we finally suppose that the galaxy geometry has not changed with time . introducing the core radius @xmath91 and the outer radius @xmath92 , the light density at a distance @xmath93 from the center is @xmath94 if @xmath95 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the ratio of the dust dimmed global flux @xmath96 of the spheroidal galaxy to the direct flux @xmath97 is @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the cylindrical coordinates , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is computed from the central optical depth @xmath105 derived from the central column density of hydrogen @xmath106 . at any radius , we have @xmath107 where @xmath5 is derived from the total mass of hydrogen @xmath108 of the galaxy . for a helium mass fraction of 28 % in the interstellar medium , we have @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the gas fraction , @xmath111 the initial mass of gas of the galaxy and @xmath112 the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "we finally obtain for the parameters of the model  ( b ) of tsai & mathews ( 1995 ) @xmath113    although the central optical depth may be very high in the early phases of evolution of spheroidal galaxies , the extinction of the overall galaxy is only about @xmath114 magnitudes in the @xmath50-band at maximum and is negligible nowadays .",
    "since neither the geometry of stars and dust , nor the quantities and properties of dust in past e / s0 are known , the previous calculations should be considered simply as a reasonable attempt to give an order of magnitude of the effect of extinction in these galaxies .",
    "scenarios of galaxy evolution aim to reproduce the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy type on the most extended wavelength range .",
    "the first step is to compute the evolving sed of an instantaneous burst of star formation for a given imf .",
    "the evolution of a real galaxy may then be described by the convolution of an sfr , related for example to the gas content , and of instantaneous bursts of various ages .        as shown by charlot et al .",

    "( 1994 ) , worthey ( 1994 ) and bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) , discrepancies in the evolutionary tracks are the main sources of uncertainty in spectral synthesis .",
    "instantaneous bursts are particularly suitable to test the weight of different evolutionary tracks on spectral synthesis , since spectra    and colors are not smoothed by convolution with the sfr . in",
    "what follows , we use the polynomial form of the imf obtained by rana & basu ( 1992 ) , which accounts for the multiplicity of stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the slope of massive stars ( @xmath115 ) @xmath116 corresponds to the value adopted in our previous models .",
    "energy distributions of an instantaneous starburst from 200   to @xmath117 are plotted at various ages in fig .",
    "[ specsursaut ] .",
    "we show on fig .",
    "[ tracecoulreduit ] the evolution of the bolometric luminosity with time for the tracks of padova and geneva .",
    "the evolution is very similar for both sets up to 1 gyr , where the low mass stars of the padova set ( @xmath118 ) undergo the helium flash and provoke a bump in the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this bump is due to a flattening of the stellar lifetime slope as a function of the initial mass of the stars in the interval @xmath119\\ m_{\\odot}$ ] .",
    "a similar feature is obtained at 1.8 gyr , when the @xmath120 of the geneva set also attains the helium flash .",
    "the luminosity of the burst computed with geneva tracks is systematically about @xmath121 higher after 2 gyr than that of padova , maybe because of overshooting .",
    "more striking differences may be observed on colors ( see fig .  [ tracecoulreduit ] ) .",
    "colors of the instantaneous starburst are derived from convolution of the energy distributions through filter passbands and calibration on the kurucz ( 1992 ) model of vega .",
    "massive stars of geneva leave the zams earlier than those of padova but , whereas the subsequent evolution of @xmath122 and @xmath37 colors is similar , presumably because of the adjustment of the stellar evolutionary parameters on optical color - magnitude diagrams of star clusters , @xmath33 differs by as much as 0.9 magnitude at 12 myr and 0.75 at 18 myr .",
    "different treatments of the red supergiant phase are clearly responsible for this , as shown by the isochrones at 12 and 18 myr ( see fig .  [ isoch ] ) . while the 12 myr isochrone of geneva does not show any blue loop after the crossing of the hr diagram and is therefore redder than that of padova , the 18 myr isochrone extends to much higher temperatures and gives bluer colors .",
    "the color @xmath33 then evolves very slowly after 30 myr , and both sets of tracks are in good agreement up to the helium flash where the bump observed in the bolometric luminosity is also visible .",
    "geneva @xmath33 then exceeds the value of padova by @xmath123 mag up to 13 gyr , where curves cross one another .",
    "the @xmath122 , @xmath37 and @xmath33 colors of geneva then show a flattening trend or a blueing , the reason of which is unclear .",
    "although the evolution of tp - agb is poorly known , we show on fig .",
    "[ tracecoulreduit ] that the high - mass ( @xmath124 ) tp - agb stars may not be neglected and strongly redden the @xmath33 by as much as 0.6 mag at 100 myr .",
    "the weight of tp - agb becomes negligible after 2 gyr and is insignificant at all ages for optical colors .",

    "<S> pegase ( * p*rojet d*e*tude des * ga*laxies par * s*ynthse * e*volutive , in french ) is a new spectrophotometric evolution model for starbursts and evolved galaxies of the hubble sequence . </S>",
    "<S> its main originality is the extension to the near - infrared ( nir ) of the atlas of synthetic spectra of rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni ( 1988 ) with a revised stellar library including cold star parameters and stellar tracks extended to the thermally - pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) and the post - agb ( pagb ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> the nir is coherently linked to the visible and the ultraviolet ( uv ) , so that the model is continuous on an exceptionally large wavelength range from 220   up to 5 @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a precise algorithm allows to follow very rapid evolutionary phases such as red supergiants or agb crucial in the nir . the nebular component is also computed in the nir . </S>",
    "<S> the extinction correction is gas - dependent for spirals and ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> a set of reference synthetic spectra at @xmath1 , to which apply cosmological k- and evolution e- corrections for high - redshift galaxies , is built from fits of observational templates . because of the lack of visible to nir spectral templates for each hubble type , we adopt statistical samples of colors , not fitted by previous models .    </S>",
    "<S> a first application of this continuous model is to solve the problem of the slope of the bright galaxy counts from @xmath2 to 19 and of the normalization parameter @xmath3 of the schechter luminosity function .    designed to be used currently and to take into account easily new observational and theoretical inputs , the model is built as a series of independent blocks . any block is clearly identified and submitted to publication . </S>",
