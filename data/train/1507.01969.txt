    "optical spectroscopy is an important and ubiquitous tool in modern experimental studies .",
    "improvements over the years in the use of lasers in optical spectroscopy has brought the field to an impressive level of accuracy and precision that is difficult to match using modern theoretical methods .",
    "even so , theory has an important role to play in optical spectroscopy . by assisting in excited state assignments and predicting the density of excited states expected in a given energy range",
    ", computational results can be a powerful tool for spectroscopists .",
    "widespread use of time dependent density functional theory@xcite ( td - dft ) for the calculation of excited states will continue for a long time to come due to the attractive low computational scaling inherent to the method .",
    "however , reliability and accuracy problems@xcite in td - dft keep the theory from replacing the more computationally expensive but highly accurate multireference configuration interaction@xcite ( mrci ) or equation of motion coupled - cluster@xcite ( eom - cc ) theories .",
    "the most commonly used form of eom - cc theory is the eom - ccsd variant,@xcite which limits ground and excited state excitations to singles and doubles only .",
    "this approximation is qualitatively consistent and approaches quantitative accuracy in many cases where single excitations are dominant .",
    "for doubly excited states , perturbative@xcite ( eom - ccsd(t ) ) or iterative@xcite ( eom - ccsdt - n ) triple excitations are required@xcite to obtain quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "the development of approximate excited state methods based on many - body perturbation and coupled - cluster theory has been an active and fruitful endevour since the emergence of the field.@xcite many approaches make use of a mean - field starting reference based on configuration interaction singles@xcite and add perturbative corrections to that reference.@xcite other approaches use a many - body treatment of propagator theory such as the algebraic - diagrammatic construction@xcite ( adc ) scheme or by using approximate coupled - cluster linear - response@xcite theory with the ccn methods.@xcite approximate methods based on equation - of - motion theory can either add a _ post hoc _ eom - cc perturbative correction@xcitefor triples or an _ a priori _ perturbative approximation.@xcite we will use perturbation theory here to develop a new perturbative eom - cc method that also includes infinite - order effects in the ground state wavefunction",
    ". the goal will be to provide a consistent and accurate way to obtain excitation energies from either a linear ccd ( lccd ) or ccsd ( lccsd ) ground state wavefunction .",
    "these methods are not intended to be a replacement method for existing fast ( eom - mbpt(2 ) ) or accurate ( eom - ccsd ) methods when considering just the calculation of excited states , but to provide a route toward a consistent excited state spectra from a specific ground state wavefunction .    in this work",
