    "in quantum mechanics a physical system is described by its wave function ( quantum state ) , whose knowledge allows us to make predictions about the odds of the results of any measurement implemented on the system .",

    "a key ingredient in quantum teleportation is a quantum channel connecting alice and bob that is supposed to be a maximally entangled bipartite pure state @xcite .",
    "however , in any realistic implementation of the protocol noise is inherently present and it affects the entangled state during its transmission to alice and bob .",
    "the main effect of noise is to turn pure states into mixed ones . a standard solution to overcome the effects of noise",

    "another important strategy to overcome this limitation is based on the direct use of the quantum channel connecting alice and bob @xcite , without resorting to distillation techniques , in which modifications in the standard teleportation protocol are made to maximize its performance .",

    "we want to take advantage of the inevitable fact that noise is always present in any real world implementation of quantum communication protocols .",
    "we want to beat the decrease in the efficiency of the protocol due to noise with noise .",

    "another aspect affecting the efficiency of the teleportation protocol in a noisy environment is related to the choice of the quantum channel , even if we choose among those having the same amount of entanglement @xcite . throughout this article",

    "we studied how the efficiency of the quantum teleportation protocol is affected when the qubits employed in its execution lie in a noisy environment . in order to model the noisy environment we employed the most common noise channels that one encounters in any realistic implementation of quantum communication protocols , namely , the bit flip , phase flip ( phase damping ) , depolarizing , and amplitude damping channels .",
    "we also studied many noise scenarios where one , two or all three qubits required for the implementation of the teleportation protocol are subjected to noise .",
    "the first remarkable result we obtained is related to the entanglement needed to get the optimal efficiency when noise is present in both the input qubit and in the quantum channel .",
    "specifically , we observed a non - trivial interplay among which quantum channel is used , its amount of entanglement , and the type of noise acting on it .",
    "indeed , for certain types of quantum channels acted by the amplitude damping noise , we showed that _",
    "less _ entanglement means _ more _",

    "the results given here and in ref .",
    "@xcite are a counterintuitive fact since for pure state inputs and pure state channels ( no noise ) more entanglement leads to more efficiency .",
    "second , we showed a scenario where _ more _ noise leads to _ more _ efficiency .",
    "this fact occurred when the input qubit , the one to be teleported from alice to bob , lies in a noisy environment described by the bit flip noise and bob s qubit , his share of the entangled channel , is also affected by this same noise .",
    "the efficiency in this case is considerably greater when compared to the situation where only the input qubit is subjected to this type of noise .",
    "this kind of behavior was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite when the channel qubits are subjected to the amplitude damping noise .",
    "third , when noise is unavoidable but either alice or bob can choose the kind of noise that acts on their qubits , we showed that the optimal combination of noisy environments leading to the highest efficiencies is related in a non - trivial way to the time ( or probability ) the qubits are affected by the noise . in many scenarios we showed that alice and bob should keep their qubits in different noisy environments in order to get the best performance for the teleportation protocol .",
    "furthermore , we showed that sometimes the optimal efficiency is obtained by letting one of the qubits be subjected for a longer time to noise than the other one .",
    "fourth , in a noisy environment we showed that the choice of the quantum channel can affect the efficiency of the teleportation protocol , even if we deal with channels having the same amount of entanglement @xcite . being more specific , we showed that if the quantum channel is a bell state and the amplitude damping noise acts on both qubits of the channel , different bell states lead to different performances for the teleportation protocol .    in summary , the main message we can draw from the results given in this paper , and from the complementary ones given in refs .",
    "@xcite , is quite clear : when noise is taken into account in analyzing the performance of a quantum communication protocol we should not expect the optimal settings for the noiseless case to hold anymore .",
    "moreover , sometimes counterintuitive optimal settings occur and , therefore , we should always analyze the types of noise we are going to face in any realistic implementation of a particular protocol and determine those optimal settings on a case - by - case basis .",
