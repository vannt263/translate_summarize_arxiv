    ".3 cm    the new @xmath4 discovered in babar@xcite as a narrow @xmath5 resonance is somewhat puzzling@xcite .",

    "we assume @xmath8 as suggested by the lightness of the state .",

    "@xmath10 is @xmath11 mev above 2320 mev and @xmath12 is a forbidden @xmath13 electromagnetic transition .    despite the high @xmath14 value in @xmath15",
    "the narrow width of the @xmath16-wave decay immediately follows if the @xmath17-spin of @xmath4 is @xmath18 .",
    "the final @xmath19 state has @xmath20 and the decay rate would naturally be suppressed to be @xmath21 expt .",
    "resolution @xmath22 10 mev .",
    "we will henceforth assume @xmath23 which is the case if @xmath4 is just a @xmath6 state and/or @xmath6 with any number of gluons or @xmath24 light quark pairs .",
    "the puzzling feature is the relative lightness of this state .",
    "the simplest assignment of @xmath4 to be the @xmath25 , @xmath26-wave quark model @xmath6 state conflicts with earlier quark model calculations.@xcite these models treat the system as a @xmath27 state and accommodate the @xmath28(1963 ) @xmath29 and the @xmath30 states and a pair of @xmath26-wave states with @xmath31 identified with the narrow @xmath32 and @xmath33 with likely @xmath34 spin parities .",
    "the remaining two @xmath26-wave states corresponding to @xmath35 with @xmath36 were predicted to lie above 2400 mev and hence the @xmath2 state was expected to decay strongly into @xmath37 and be very broad .",
    "these considerations , on which we elaborate further , make a @xmath26-wave @xmath6 interpretation of @xmath4 difficult .",
    "yet , such an interpretation is deemed to be favored by the recent discovery of the @xmath38 @xmath39.@xcite    we note that for all known @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 states the gap between the @xmath43 state and the lowest @xmath26 state exceeds @xmath22 320 mev , making the @xmath22 220 mev split between @xmath44 and @xmath4 clearly stand out as the smallest .",
    "this holds also for the new @xmath2 @xmath45 state seen in belle@xcite as a broad resonance in the @xmath46 channel at 2308 mev ( again 300 mev above the triplet s - wave @xmath47 .",
    "if indeed the new @xmath2 @xmath45 state is confirmed the lightness of the @xmath0 is even more puzzling as it is almost degenerate with its non - strange @xmath45 analog , whereas in all meson / baryon states the penalty for such a @xmath48 substitution exceeds @xmath49100 - 150 mev , the constituent quark @xmath50 mass difference .",
    "the large splitting are indeed suggested by the @xmath26-wave centrifugal barrier : @xmath51 with @xmath52 or @xmath53 , @xmath54 for @xmath55 or @xmath56 ( since @xmath57 increases with @xmath58 , this splitting changes only mildly with @xmath58 ) .",
    "the above suggests considering @xmath4 as primarily an @xmath18 four - quark @xmath59 bound state or the @xmath18 @xmath60 bound state .",
    "the idea that certain states can be more readily obtained as four - quark states and considerations of exotic ( non-@xmath61 ) or @xmath62 ) states in general date back to the very beginning of quark models and qcd .",
    "baryonium @xmath63 states were suggested by considerations of duality @xcite and in recent years re - appeared as light - heavy @xmath64 tetra quarks and/or as molecular bound states of @xmath65 or even @xmath66 dominated by pion exchange @xcite .",
    "since the lightest @xmath26-wave @xmath67 state is expected to lie significantly above the @xmath68 , the light @xmath69 and @xmath70 are unlikely to be just @xmath67 state .",
    "r. jaffe suggested @xcite that these states arise as four - quark states within bag models , thanks to a favorable pattern of chromomagnetic  hyperfine \" attraction .",
    "this in turn motivated prediction of striking , strong interactions stable , hexa @xmath71 and penta@xmath72 states  which were not found to date.@xcite    in general the paucity of exotic @xmath73 and @xmath74 mesons and baryons traces to the lightness of the pseudoscalar pion causing the exotics to be extremely broad and overlapping resonances .",
    "the decay of non -",
    "exotic @xmath61 states say @xmath75 into a pair of @xmath61 pions is suppressed by a @xmath76 color factor.@xcite this is * not * the case for decay of exotic hadrons which simply fall apart into its constituent non - exotic hadrons with no penalty for creating an extra @xmath61 pair .",
    "thus if the new @xmath4 is not a standard @xmath26-wave @xmath6 state , it may well be the first genuine exotic four quark @xmath77 or @xmath78 which is narrow .",
    "our main aim in the following is to point out a likely analogous @xmath79 or @xmath80 state .",
    "qcd inequalities then suggest that this new state is lighter than 3660 mev .",
    "more likely @xmath29 is the appropriate lowest energy superposition of all three :    @xmath81    with @xmath82 favored by our interpretation .",
    ".3 cm    the above short summary fails to address the main issue .",
    "a reliable theoretical framework for computing the hadronic spectrum in general ( and of four - quark states in particular ) is lacking .    in principle",
    ", one could use a path integral formulation together with an appropriate lattice discretization to numericaly evaluate euclidean @xmath83-point correlators of local color singlet operators.@xcite    to find the mass of the lightest hadron in a channel with given quark flavors and lorentz @xmath84 quantum numbers , we use the two - point correlator of currents with these quantum numbers :    @xmath85    with @xmath86 the approprite dirac matrix .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath87 as @xmath88 is controlled by the lowest mass particle  say the @xmath89 scalar state of interest when we use @xmath90 :    @xmath91    more generally hadron masses , couplings and scattering amplitudes can be obtained by inverse laplace transforms of two , and @xmath83-point euclidean correlators .",
    "the latter can be written after integration over the fermionic fields ( which appear in the action in a bilinear form ) as path integrals over gauge field configurations @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath93 we have :    @xmath94    with @xmath95 the propagator of the quark @xmath96 , in the background field @xmath92 , the trace is over spinor and color indices and @xmath97 is the ( positive ! ) measure obtained after integrating the fermions to yield the determinant factor    @xmath98    and @xmath99 is the euclidean yang - mills action .",
    "unfortunately , the computational complexity of generating many gauge backgrounds and evaluating for each the fermionic propagator and , in particular , the fermionic determinant prevents carrying out these calculations reliably at present .",

    "the role of such terms in general and its effect on the inequalities we suggest in particular will be discussed at length later .",

    "the pure gluonic state hardly propagates over any distancee . rather due to the lightness of the quarks",
    "the dominant fermionic paths making most of the contribution to the propagation and path integral in ( [ e07b ] ) are very extended and go most of the way from @xmath120 to @xmath121 ( when @xmath295 ) as indicated in fig .",
    "only a tiny gap remains to be bridged over by the gluons .",
    "paranthetically we note that the actual pattern of fermionic paths may be different from what is suggested by fig .",
    "thus in the strong coupling limit large e , b fields are excited and there are in general few  channels \" along which the fermions can propagate with minimal hindrance .",
    "the absolute square appearing in @xmath296 ) ( @xmath297 ) makes it favorable to have also the returning anti - quark line follow the same channel .",
    "this then would suggest that the worldlines of the quark and antiquark stay at a finite distance ( the width of the above `` channels '' @xmath298 ) from each other and are `` confined '' .",
    "it is amusing to go further @xcite and gain a qualitative understanding of sxsb in this limit .",
    "the vacuum `` channels '' exist independently of the probing at @xmath120 and @xmath121 and the @xmath299 propagation from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "these channels random walk with a finite @xmath300 step and often bend `` backwards '' .",
    "such bends appear at a given time slice as @xmath61 pairs admixed inside the propagating pion .",
    "this then suggests that a simple explanation of eq .",
    "( [ e35 ] ) follows from a more careful consideration of these @xmath61 paths in the pion .",
    "similar paths with one small break appear in the case of the @xmath270 in the disconnected parts .",
    "this may naturally cancel the long - range @xmath301 contribution .",
    ".3 cm    the disconnected `` hairpin '' diagrams play a crucial role for the @xmath302 light pseudoscalar channels and drastically decrease the binding therein . as we will next argue the effect of such light quark annihilations on the quadriquark mass inequalities may enhance the bindings in the @xmath303 channels .",
    "hence the contribution of the second term in ( [ e07b ] ) is likely to be positive and the derivation of the inequalities goes through .",
    "( a ) the first , no - annihilation term .",
    "( b ) the second term with the light @xmath304 quarks annihilating .",
    "( c ) the second term redrawn to emphasize the short length over which pure glue propagates instead of light quarks , and the connection to harari - rosner duality diagrams with @xmath75 , @xmath305 exchanges . ]    to illustrate this point we redraw in fig .",
    "[ f03]b the flavor disconnected terms i.e. , the second part in ( [ e07b ] ) in a manner similar to that used in fig .",
    "specifically , we let the light quarks propagate over most of the euclidean distance @xmath306 with a short gap bridged by gluons .",
    "this would be justified if the four - quark state @xmath307 indeed is lighter than the state of @xmath308 plus glue propagating in the middle part of fig .",
    "[ note that the lightest such glueball state is a @xmath309    the diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ f03]c is just the classical harari - rosner `` duality diagram '' with a relatively * light * @xmath61 bound state exchanged in the @xmath310-channel of the meson - meson scattering .",
    "( the fact that the four - quark lines eventually merge at @xmath120 ( and at @xmath121 ) implies that we project out only the @xmath311 state of interest .",
    "it does not affect the following argument pertaining to the sign of this contribution . )",
    "the lightness is reflected via the narrow gap between the quark and anti - quark propagating in the @xmath310-channel . in a string model description",
    "this separation is proportional to the mass of the @xmath61 meson .",
    "these @xmath312 etc .",
    "exchanges were indeed considered in our @xmath313 , @xmath185 , and @xmath80 potential model picture of section iii , and are well known to provide * attractive * forces ( particularly in the @xmath314 diagonal channels ) .",
    "indeed this underlies the argument for positive interaction kernels used above in the first , heuristic derivation of the desired mass inequality . for qcd inequalities between four - quark states ,",
    "we need positive `` disconnected '' ( second ) part in ( 7b ) just like the  connected \" first part .",
    "we can not demonstrate this separately for each background field in the qcd path integral [ e07b ] .",
    "the following arguments are , however , suggestive .",
    "first , we compare the joint propagation of four quarks from @xmath120 to @xmath121 with the separate independent propagation of the two @xmath61 pairs .",
    "we argue that with annihilation neglected    @xmath315    and also motivate    @xmath316    in the @xmath88 limit these may suggest that bound @xmath317 or @xmath318 states exist .",
    "@xmath319    @xmath320    with disconnected terms omitted : @xmath321    @xmath322    and    @xmath323    the inequalities    @xmath324    and    @xmath325    then follow either as a schwarz inequality or from more heuristic considerations in the case of equation [ e42b ] ( see footnote ) .",
    "these correlator inequalities imply the mass inequalities ( [ e40a ] , [ e40b ] ) .",
    "a more careful analysis @xcite suggests that the latter * do not * imply that @xmath80 and/or @xmath326 bound states exist .",
    "rather it implies an attractive @xmath16-wave scattering length .    what is the impact of turning on the flavor disconnected contributions on the mass inequalities ?",
    "one effect is the enhanced @xmath270 mass ( relative to @xmath327 ) .",
    "this however leaves attractive interactions between hadrons in general and between the @xmath270 and @xmath29 and @xmath270 and @xmath328 in particular .",
    "the interaction in the last case involves only gluonic exchanges as there are no common light quark to annihilate and/or exchange . such two ( or more ) gluon exchange  casimir - polder \" type interactions between objects of similar chromo - electric magnetic properties ( as * any * two hadrons invariably are ) tend to be always attractive .",
    "the transitions to states including @xmath329 appears to be the main obstruction to both the derivations of the inequalities ( which follow if we consider only the @xmath3 , @xmath143 , and @xmath191 channels or the corresponding four quark correlators ) .",
    "the very same transition may impede the discovery of the predicted new @xmath3 bound state as the latter may have a broad decay width into @xmath330 .",
    "indeed heavier @xmath331 quarks in the @xmath332 state considered make such a transition more likely .",
    "thus the @xmath4 bound by @xmath333 mev in the @xmath313 channel the @xmath107 threshold is yet @xmath334 mev higher .",
    "however the new @xmath80 state which our inequality predicts is @xmath335 mev below the @xmath336 threshold and @xmath337 above the @xmath326 threshold .    the relatively narrow width ( @xmath49 50 mev ) of @xmath1 into @xmath338 states ( where annihilation of slightly heavier @xmath67 is involved and the similar width of @xmath259 into @xmath339 ( where no @xmath67 annihilation are needed ) suggests that also the decay width of the new @xmath340 @xmath341 state into @xmath326 may not be prohibitively large .",
    "the above discussion suggests attractive interactions in both @xmath3 and @xmath326 channels .",
    "hence even if the @xmath326 channel does not bind on its own it generates some threshold enhancement .",
    "the mixing of the @xmath326 and @xmath3 channel may in turn further lower the mass of the state of interest .",
    "all the above considerations then suggest that the new @xmath3 state predicted by our qcd inequalities  while definitely broader than the narrow @xmath4 state may still manifest in high statistcs experiments . before concluding we add few more comments :    \\(i ) obviously @xmath342 states analogous to the @xmath4 exist .",
    "the @xmath343 analog of our predicted @xmath3 state lies even higher above the @xmath344 threshold .",
    "the small chromo - electric polarizability of @xmath345 will strongly quench the ",
    "casimir - polder \" residual interactions between @xmath345 and @xmath270 .",
    "\\(ii ) an issue omitted in the above in the role played by annihilation of the `` heavy '' @xmath67 pairs in @xmath1 which again is assumed to be an @xmath346 @xmath347 , @xmath18 state .",
    "the relative small @xmath348 of @xmath349 @xmath16-wave decay despite the huge q value indicates that to a large extent the `` zweig rule '' is operative and the annihilation of @xmath67 pairs is suppressed .",
    "\\(iii ) it has been suggested that the new babar relatively light @xmath350 state could be interpreted as the  parity doublet partner \" of @xmath29 @xmath351 state.@xcite parity doubling is a vestige of a world where the @xmath352 transition has not occurred and the @xmath353 symmetry generated via @xmath354 ; or @xmath355 and @xmath356 is linearly realized via parity doublets .",
    "superficially this seems to be an altogether different interpretation than the states @xmath357 with one extra pair of light quarks considered here .",
    "this need not be the case .",
    "parity doubling , i.e. degeneracy of @xmath16 and @xmath26-wave states is extremely difficult to understand in a simple n.r .",
    "quark model due to the prohibitive cost of @xmath26-wave @xmath358 excitations ( a point which we belabored in the first section ) .",
    "indeed unbroken chiral symmetry does not hold for most composite models .",
    "we can incorporate this feature by assuming that hadrons contain an  infinite \" number of @xmath61 pairs . in this case",
    "@xmath359 when acting on a fermion , generates an extra @xmath360 pair which blends into the  coherent \" state with many pairs producing the parity doublet without any energy penalty .",
    "the introduction of a light @xmath61 pair into the @xmath6 ( or @xmath361 ) @xmath291 ground state was motivated above as a way to achieve a lower energy realization of a @xmath2 state than via a simple @xmath26-wave excitation .",
    "this can be viewed as a modest , first step towards the infinitely many light quark anti - quark pairs implicit when ideal parity doubling holds .",
    "the spectroscopy of the @xmath362 system is well understood and all the four p - wave states are accounted for .",
    "finding below @xmath80 threshold the new @xmath363 i=0 0@xmath364 state that qcd inequalities suggest ( if the four quark interpretation of @xmath29(2320 ) and @xmath365(980 ) is correct ) would constitute compelling evidence for four quark states .    at the present time the discovery of one of the missing 1@xmath366 @xmath6 state at 2460 mev is deemed to favor interpreting @xmath29(2320 ) as a p - wave excitation of two quarks .",
    "clearly such an interpretation will be bolstered if the missing heavier and broad 0(+ ) @xmath367 state and the new @xmath368 state discussed here will not be discovered .",
    "we note that the km favoured @xmath369 constituting @xmath4920% of all b decays may offer good hunting grounds for the new particle which predominantly decays into @xmath370 .",
    "i would like to thank m.  cornwall for helpful discussions on the @xmath371 problem and m.  v.  purohit for insight on the prospects of experimentally discovering the proposed state .",
