    ", we likely have reached the maximum energy achievable with a circular electron collider , i.e. , about @xmath0  gev / beam .",
    "the limitation is the energy lost each turn through synchrotron radiation , which scales as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of the beam and @xmath3 is the mass of the particle .",
    "a linear electron - positron collider is currently under consideration which will operate at energies of @xmath4  gev per beam .",
    "reaching these energies requires very high electric fields as well as very long accelerators . barring a breakthrough in acceleration techniques , it is difficult to see how much higher energies will be possible .",
    "a muon collider could reach much higher energies in a circular accelerator since @xmath5 .",
    "collisions between point - like particles would then be possible at energies similar to those achievable for proton accelerators , thus reopening the energy frontier with lepton colliders .",
    "the physics case for a high energy muon collider has been reviewed in many places .",
    "a recent compilation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a significant additional benefit of a muon collider would be the intense and well understood flux of neutrinos resulting from muon decays allowing long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments to be performed with high statistics .",
    "the collider complex could also be designed in such a way that neutrino scattering physics programs could be pursued .",
    "the physics case for a neutrino factory has been studied extensively and detailed accelerator studies are underway  @xcite .",
    "low energy muons have a wide range of physics applications  @xcite which could also be pursued if the intense muon source required for the muon collider were constructed .",
    "an obvious difficulty for the construction of a muon collider is the short muon lifetime ( @xmath6  @xmath7s ) .",
    "muons are not readily available and must be produced with a multi - mw proton source .",
    "once the muons are produced , they occupy a very large phase space which must be reduced .",
    "the time available for this process is too short for existing techniques to be applicable ( i.e. ; stochastic cooling , synchrotron radiation damping rings ) .",
    "a new technique is required to reduce the muon emittance in a very short time .",
    "a related problem is that of backgrounds resulting from muon decays .",
    "muon decays at all stages of the accelerator complex will produce radiation levels which will pose significant challenges for the accelerator elements .",
    "any detector used to study the muon collisions will also see a large background flux from upstream muon decays .",
    "of particular importance for a high energy , high current , muon beam is the radiation hazard resulting from the subsequent neutrino beam , which can not be shielded  @xcite .",
    "many of the difficulties listed above could be reduced with very effective muon cooling .",
    "cooler beams would allow fewer muons for a given luminosity , and thereby reduce the experimental backgrounds , reduce the radiation from muon decays , reduce the radiation from neutrino interactions , and allow for smaller apertures in the accelerator elements .",
    "fewer required muons would also be welcome for the targetry and proton driver , which provide severe technical and financial constraints .",
    "we therefore identify the efficient cooling of the muon beam phase space as the signature challenge for a future muon collider .",
    "before briefly reviewing the proposed muon cooling schemes , we provide an overview of a possible muon collider complex along with beam parameters . figure  [ fig : overview ] shows schematically the different elements required for a muon collider .",
    "the first stage is a proton driver , which is a high intensity proton accelerator producing several mw of protons in the energy range @xmath8  gev ( different schemes have different optimal energies ) .",
    "the protons then impact a target in a region with a very strong magnetic field , and the resulting charged particles , primarily pions , are captured in a decay channel . the pion drift and",
    "decay channel is optimized to yield a maximum number of muons in the required energy range .",
    "the muons then enter a cooling channel where the phase space of the beam is compressed and they are then brought to the desired energy in a series of accelerators .    a parameter set for a 3  tev center - of - mass ( com ) energy muon collider is given in  @xcite , and is summarized in table  [ tab : pars ] .",
    ".a set of parameters for a 3 tev com energy muon collider  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     the yield for this scheme is @xmath9 per 2 gev proton .",
    "this yield does not change greatly for window thicknesses up to 20  nm . as a consequence of the alternating transverse electric field",
    "there are two beamlets emerging .",
    "the question of the final emittance of the total beam after recombining the beamlets is left open .",
    "averaging their emittances or at worst adding them together would still result in a beam of sufficient emittance for luminous collisions .",
    "the total phase space reduction , depending on how one combines the beamlets , ranges from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "this scheme produces a cool muon beam with @xmath12 .",
    "this should be compared to @xmath13 from table  [ tab : pars ] , which is the minimum emittance for luminous collisions at a muon collider .",
    "the frictional cooling scheme outlined in this paper is an order of magnitude better than this benchmark .",
    "the yield is a factor of 5 lower than hoped but is compensated by the reduced emittance .",
    "although earlier studies  @xcite have shown similar promising results for @xmath14 , this scheme has not been fully evaluated for @xmath14 .",
    "there is still room for improvement .",
    "for example , the electric field configuration is smoothly oscillating to make it more realistic but it is far from optimal .",
    "parameters , such as the length of the cell and strength of the initial reacceleration can still be tuned together to achieve better performance .",
    "nonetheless , the ingredients for successful phase space reduction of muon beams are there .",
    "this paper is meant to outline a possible phase space reduction scheme for a muon beam intended for a muon collider . amongst the improvements and refinements of the scheme ,",
    "there are several issues which require further thought and eventually experimental proof of principle .",
    "the windows must be thin , gas tight and , eventually , made larger in area than currently available .",
    "a frictional cooling demonstration experiment using protons  @xcite was performed at nevis laboratories .",
    "the experiment used thin windows which were 20  nm carbon on a thin nickel grid , as quoted from the manufacturer . however , the data indicated an effective thickness which was more than an order of magnitude larger than what was expected , resulting in all protons which achieved the equilibrium being stopped in the exit window .",
    "this complication further emphasizes the importance of the window issue .",
    "the capture cross section of the @xmath14 by he or h@xmath15 gas , at energies below 1  kev , is experimentally unknown .",
    "theoretical calculations were incorporated in the simulation programs but it remains an experimental issue for this scheme .",
    "we anticipate performing an experiment to directly measure this capture cross section .",
    "most accelerating structures in particle accelerators ( rf cavities etc . )",
    "operate in as good a vacuum as possible to avoid electrical breakdown .",
    "conversely , breakdown can also be suppressed by using dense materials between electrodes . in this case , the mean free path between collisions for free ions is so small that the ions can not accelerate to high enough energies to create an avalanche .",
    "the paschen law  @xcite defines the breakdown voltage in gases as a function of pressure and distance . for 1  atm of helium , the electric field achievable before breakdown is less than @xmath16  mv / m",
    "this is an order of magnitude less than what has been considered in the frictional cooling cell .",
    "however , in a crossed @xmath17 and @xmath18 field , a charged particle experiences cycloid motion resulting in a maximum kinetic energy defined by @xmath19 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the charged particle .",
    "hence , the maximum kinetic energy that can be achieved by an ionized electron for @xmath20  t and @xmath21  mv / m is 11.4  ev .",
    "this is below the ionization energy of both helium and hydrogen ( 25.4  ev and 13.6  ev respectively ) and hence an ionized electron would not create an electrical breakdown in the gas .",
    "it should therefore be possible to suppress multiplication in our cooling cell .",
    "the crossed @xmath22 and @xmath23 fields may allow the bounds from the paschen curves to be avoided but there is still a large amount of energy being deposited into the gas cell which will create a large number of free ions .",
    "the danger is not that avalanche and breakdown will occur but rather that the separation of the free charges may screen or at worst cancel the imposed electric field .    to meet the final luminosity requirements , of order @xmath24 muons per pulse will have to be stopped in the gas cell , with a mean initial kinetic energy of @xmath25  mev .",
    "taking an ionization energy of @xmath26  ev for helium , we find @xmath27 ionized electrons .",
    "this is a large number of electrons and ions , which will drift apart in the crossed electric and magnetic field , tending to screen the field .",
    "the speed at which this occurs , and the effect on the extraction of the muons , will clearly need careful evaluation .",
    "a muon collider would be extremely valuable to the field of high energy physics , leading to a new era of precision investigation whilst opening up the high energy frontier for discovery .",
    "any muon collider will require an efficient and effective cooling scheme for muons .",
    "the scheme described here is based on the concept of frictional cooling . to",
    "that end simulations have been performed to evaluate frictional cooling as well as the components required upstream of the cooling module , such as the proton driver .",
    "we propose a 2  gev proton beam impinging of a copper target as the front end . by capturing the low energy pion cloud transverse to the target ,",
    "relatively equal yields of both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are produced .",
    "this allows the development of a symmetric machine .",
    "the final six - dimensional emittance coming out of the cooling section is @xmath30 , which is better than the target emittance in various parameters sets of potential muon colliders .",
    "the yield for this scheme , as it was simulated for this study , is @xmath31  gev proton .",
    "this is somewhat low but there is potential for improvement .",
    "a rapid reacceleration of the muon beam has also been developed and takes the cool muon beam to a mean momentum of 147  mev / c with a survival probability of 30% .",
    "the simulation code has been experimentally supported by data from a frictional cooling experiment with protons  @xcite and more experiments are planned to further test the monte carlo .",
    "the results outlined in this paper show that a muon beam of sufficiently small emittance for luminous collisions can be produced .",
    "the steps from production , cooling and reacceleration have been addressed and a series of critical issues have also been outlined for this scheme to be further developed . at this stage",
    "the results are encouraging and frictional cooling continues to be an exciting alternative potential for the successful phase space reduction of muon beams intended for a muon collider .",
