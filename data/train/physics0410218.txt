    "the laser pulse interacting with the plasma loses its energy , as it generates wake fields behind itself .",
    "since the process is adiabatic the ratio between the e. m. energy density and the frequency is conserved , so that frequency downshift occurs for the wake field .",
    "moreover , since the group velocity of the laser pulse decreases with the frequency , the low frequency part of the e. m. radiation of the pulse propagates with very low velocity .",
    "when the frequency becomes lower than the langmuir frequency , the e. m. energy becomes trapped inside the related density cavity , thus forming a slowly moving solitary structure .",
    "note that in 2d and 3d it is found that solitary waves can merge , thus they are not strictly speaking solitons .",
    "it has been observed that a large part of the laser pulse energy can be transformed into solitons @xcite .",
    "it can then be argued that solitary waves may play an important role in the laser  plasma interaction .",
    "when pic simulations are performed in inhomogeneous plasmas @xcite , it is found that low frequency solitary waves generated by superintense laser pulses are accelerated along the density gradient towards the lowest density values ( e.g. , the plasma  vacuum interface ) where they radiate their energy in the form of low frequency electromagnetic bursts . this process can be a signature of soliton formation .",
    "pic simulations show that the time of the soliton formation is much shorter than the ion response time , so that ions can be assumed at rest during this process . for approximately @xmath141 oscillation periods of the e. m. field inside the soliton ( which is of the order of @xmath142 )",
    ", the ions can be assumed as fixed . for longer times , the ponderomotive force starts to dig a hole in the ion density , and the parameters of the solitons change .",
    "what was a soliton on the electron timescale is no more a soliton on the ion timescale .",
    "nevertheless , a low frequency e. m. wave packet remains well confined inside a slowly expanding plasma cavity .",
    "this e. m. entity has been called a postsoliton @xcite .    in addition , 1d fluid simulations in `` slightly '' overdense plasmas ( i.e. , for plasma densities @xmath143 times the critical density ) have shown that penetration of relativistically intense laser radiation occurs by soliton  like structures moving into the plasma @xcite .",
    "many theoretical problems are still open even for 1d solitons , as , e.g. , the temperature effects at any propagation speed and arbitrary wave amplitude , the soliton dynamics in the presence of plasma inhomogeneity , the properties of linearly polarized solitons , and last but not least the stability of such structures ( e. g. , see discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "we point out that the first macroscopic evidence of soliton formation in the interaction of an intense ( @xmath144 w/@xmath145 ) laser pulse with an underdense plasma has been reported in @xcite . long - lived , macroscopic bubble ",
    "like structures have been detected through the deflection that the associated electric charge separation causes in a proton probe beam @xcite .",
