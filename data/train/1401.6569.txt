    "the two - component camassa  holm ( 2ch ) system , @xmath5 which we want to consider here .",
    "it has been derived as a modell for shallow water by constantin and ivanov @xcite and has been studied intensively over the last few years , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the great interest in the ch equation and its generalizations , see e.g. @xcite relies on the fact that even smooth initial data might lead to classical solutions which only exist locally . in the case of the 2ch system , this is due to the fact that wave breaking can occur within finite time , that is @xmath6 becomes unbounded from below pointwise while @xmath7 and @xmath8 remain bounded , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "more precisely the function @xmath9 turns into a positive , finite radon measure at breaking time , which means that energy concentrates on sets of measure zero .",
    "thus in order to describe weak solutions , one does not only consider pairs @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 , but triplets @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a positive , finite radon measure with @xmath15 , see definition  [ def : d ] .",
    "however , one is still facing the problem , what would be a natural way to prolong the solution beyond wave breaking .",
    "one possibility is to reformulate the 2ch system in lagrangian coordinates @xmath16 ( see definition  [ th : ldef ] and [ def : f ] ) .",
    "a big advantage of this approach is that the measure @xmath14 in eulerian coordinates is mapped to the function @xmath17 in lagrangian coordinates ,    @xmath18    moreover , this new setting allows to identify where wave breaking takes place by identifying the points where @xmath19 and in particular , all the involved functions @xmath20 are bounded .",
    "the associated system of differential equations , which describes the time evolution , provides us then with one possibility to continue the solution after wave breaking .",
    "however , dependent on how @xmath17 is manipulated at breaking time , one obtains different kinds of solutions .",
    "the most prominent ones are the conservative solutions , where the energy contained remains unchanged with respect to time , see @xcite and the dissipative ones , where a sudden drop of energy occurs at breaking time , which have been studied in @xcite . rather recently",
    "a new class of solutions has been introduced , the so - called @xmath21-dissipative solutions , which provide a continuous interpolation between conservative and dissipative solutions , @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is to show when wave breaking can occur for initial data @xmath22 .",
    "all our considerations will be based on the description of conservative solutions in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "therefore we summarize in section  [ sec:2 ] the interplay between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates and how the underlying system of ordinary differential equations , which describes global conservative solutions of the 2ch system , looks like .",
    "while doing so , we will focus on what wave breaking means in different formulations and what we can read off from the system of differential equations for the behavior before and after breaking time .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] then focuses on the prediction of wave breaking by following @xmath6 and @xmath23 along characteristics @xmath24 , which solve @xmath25 for some given initial data @xmath26 .",
    "we will prove the following result .",
    "[ thm : main ] given @xmath27 and denote by @xmath28 the global conservative solution of the 2ch system at time @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath30 , then the following holds    1 .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath32 for some @xmath33 , then wave breaking will occur within the time interval @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 denotes the solution of @xmath36 2 .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath37 for some @xmath33 , then wave breaking occured within the time interval @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath35 denotes the solution of @xmath36 3 .",
    "assume @xmath39 for some @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath40 be such that @xmath41 , where @xmath26 denotes the initial characteristic curve defined by .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the solution of @xmath43 , then @xmath44 can not blow up .",
    "the aim of this section is to present the interplay between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates and how the underlying system of ordinary differential equations in lagrangian coordinates , which describes global conservative solutions of the 2ch system , looks like .",
    "since the results stated in this section have already been proved earlier , we refer the interested reader for more details to @xcite , while we here focus on pointing out properties related to wave breaking .",
    "let us first focus on the interplay between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates .",
    "it is well - known that solutions of the 2ch system might enjoy wave breaking within finite time , which means that positive amounts of energy can concentrate on sets of measure zero .",
    "thus the set of possible initial data , will not consist of pairs @xmath10 , where @xmath45 and @xmath23 are functions , but of triplets @xmath46 , where @xmath14 is a positive , finite radon measure , which describes the concentration of energy .",
    "the admissible set of eulerian coordinates is then given by    [ eulerian coordinates][def : d ] the set @xmath47 is composed of all triplets @xmath46 such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath14 is a positive , finite radon measure whose absolutely continuous part , @xmath48 , satisfies @xmath49    the weak formulation of the 2ch system    [ equiv : sys ] @xmath50    where @xmath51 hints that it could be possible to describe solutions of the 2ch system with the help of the method of characteristics .",
    "indeed , one defines the time evolution of the characteristic @xmath42 to be @xmath52 for some given initial data @xmath53 , and introduces the functions @xmath54 whose time evolution is given through .",
    "however , this ansatz has two drawbacks , on the one hand we do not know yet how @xmath55 evolves with respect to time , and on the other hand how to combine @xmath55 and @xmath42 .",
    "the last issue will be resolved next by introducing a suitable mapping from eulerian coordinates @xmath47 to lagrangian coordinates @xmath56 .",
    "[ th : ldef ] for any @xmath46 in @xmath47 , let    [ eq : ldef ] @xmath57    then @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath58 the mapping which to any element @xmath59 associates @xmath60 given by .    since @xmath14 is a positive , finite radon measure , we have that the function @xmath61 is increasing and lower semi - continuous .",
    "we therefore obtain , as an immediate consequence , that @xmath24 is an increasing function , such that we can find to any @xmath33 at least one @xmath40 such that @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , we have that if a positive amount of energy concentrates at some point @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 , then implies that the point @xmath63 will be mapped to an interval @xmath65 $ ] , such that @xmath66 and @xmath62 for all @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 is lipschitz continuous with lipschitz constant at most one , and hence differentiable almost everywhere by rademacher s theorem .",
    "thus @xmath19 for almost every @xmath67 $ ] , which is equivalent to @xmath68 for almost every @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath69 . in general",
    ", one has that @xmath70 by besicovitch s derivation theorem , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.22 ) , and @xmath71 .",
    "the above considerations show that wave breaking in lagrangian coordinates means that @xmath72 equals @xmath73 , and the concentrated energy can be read of from the function @xmath74 integrated over @xmath75 . in particular",
    ", one can view , roughly speaking , @xmath17 , which is a function , as the relabeled version of the measure @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , implies that @xmath76 for almost every @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath77 and @xmath17 are bounded , we have that @xmath19 implies @xmath78 .    before introducing the set of lagrangian coordinates , which provides us with a list of all properties inherited by @xmath20 necessary for global conservative solutions to exist , we will characterize relabeling functions .",
    "these functions will not only play a key role when defining @xmath56 , but also when identifying equivalence classes in lagrangian coordinates , which turn up since we introduced 4 lagrangian coordinates in contrast to 3 eulerian coordinates , and hence a degree of freedom , which could cause trouble , when considering questions concerning the uniqueness of solutions .",

    "note that @xmath113 is well - defined for all @xmath114 .",
    "moerover , it is not only possible to consider forward in time , but also backward .",
    "we already saw that wave breaking at time @xmath115 for some @xmath40 means that @xmath116 .",
    "then we get from that @xmath117 , while @xmath118 .",
    "applying lemma  [ lem : charh ] to @xmath119 , we get that @xmath120 , which means that @xmath121 changes from negative to positive at breaking time @xmath115 .",
    "we will see some consequences of this observation in the next section .",
    "although relabeling will not play an important role in our further investigations , we will state the most important results here , for the sake of completeness . for any",
    "@xmath122 and any function @xmath123 we denote @xmath124 by @xmath125 .",
    "we say that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are equivalent , if there exists a relabeling function @xmath123 such that @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 then @xmath130 contains exactly one element of each equivalence class .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath131 is a mapping from @xmath47 to @xmath130 and therefore different elements in @xmath47 are mapped to different elements in @xmath130 , which is why the mapping @xmath131 is well - defined .",
    "moerover , let us denote by @xmath132 , the solutions of at time @xmath29 with initial data @xmath126 , then @xmath133 since @xmath134 does not imply @xmath135 for all @xmath112 , it would be a huge advantage if we could find a mapping from lagrangian coordinates @xmath56 to eulerian coordinates @xmath47 , such that any two elements in @xmath56 belonging to the same equivalence class are mapped to the same element in eulerian coordinates .",
    "[ th : umudef ] given any element @xmath122 .",
    "then , the measure @xmath136 is absolutely continuous , and we define @xmath46 as follows    [ eq : umudef ]",
    "@xmath137    we have that @xmath46 belongs to @xmath47 .",
    "we denote by @xmath138 the mapping which to any @xmath126 in @xmath56 associates the element @xmath139 as given by . in particular , the mapping @xmath140 is invariant under relabeling .",
    "finally we recall that the push - forward of a measure @xmath141 by a measureable function @xmath87 is the measure @xmath142 .",
    "thus theorem  [ th : umudef ] implies that if there exists an interval of positive length @xmath65 $ ] such that @xmath62 for all @xmath67 $ ] , then @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "after recalling the interplay between eulerian and lagrangian coordinates and presenting the system of differential equations describing the time evolution in lagrangian coordinates , we want to investigate when wave breaking might occur , that means when @xmath6 can become unbounded from below pointwise .",
    "given some initial data @xmath27 , we can find to almost every @xmath33 , a @xmath40 such that @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "let us denote @xmath147 then the set @xmath148 has full measure .",
    "indeed , we have , after a change of variables @xmath149 then for all @xmath150 , the variables @xmath151 are well - defined . since @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we have @xmath154 and @xmath155 from , we get @xmath156 and @xmath157 thus the system under consideration will be        here it is important to note , that for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the energy @xmath159 , is preserved ( cf . ) , since we are considering conservative solutions .",
    "thus @xmath106 and @xmath160 can be bounded uniformly ( with respect to time ) by a constant only dependent on @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath163 and @xmath164            let @xmath179 be a decreasing sequence of constants such that @xmath180 for all @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "then we can associate to each @xmath179 , as before , a time @xmath183 , such that @xmath184 and @xmath177 is strictly decreasing on the interval @xmath185 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath186    unfortunately , this argument has one drawback so far , we do not know if the sequence @xmath187 is convergent",
    ". however what we do know , is that the sequence @xmath187 is increasing .",
    "this means if we can show that the sequence @xmath187 is uniformly bounded then there exists a positive time @xmath115 such that @xmath188 and @xmath115 is the time where wave breaking occurs , since @xmath177 becomes unbounded from below .",
    "therefore consider the differential equation @xmath189 where @xmath30 , with initial data @xmath190",
    ". then @xmath191 and @xmath192 is strictly decreasing .",
    "moreover , @xmath192 is negative and an upper bound for @xmath177 , i.e. @xmath193 , as long as @xmath177 is well - defined .",
    "a qualitative analysis of shows that @xmath192 , will blow up .",
    "we claim that this happens within finite time . if so the blow up time of @xmath192 provides us with an upper bound for the sequence @xmath187 .",
    "the solution of is given by @xmath194 a close look reveals that both the numerator , which remains negative for all times , and the denominator , which is positive at initial time , are absolutely bounded .",
    "thus @xmath195 can only blow up within finite time if the denominator equals zero , i.e. @xmath196 solving this very last equation for @xmath29 , provides us with an upper bound on the sequence @xmath187 and proves .",
    "although our argument is rigorous for a particular sequence @xmath179 , it is left to show that @xmath115 is independent of the sequence @xmath179 we choose .",
    "assume the opposite , that is there exist two sequences @xmath179 and @xmath197 as above , with @xmath198 then we can find @xmath199 , such that @xmath200 for all @xmath201 . since we have , by construction , that @xmath202 , which means in particular finite , and @xmath177 is strictly decreasing on @xmath203 $ ] , it follows that @xmath204 for all @xmath181 , which contradicts @xmath182 as @xmath205",
    "as already pointed out , a rigorous analysis of reveals that @xmath121 changes sign from negative to positive , at breaking time . due to the conditions one has to impose , to obtain global conservative solutions , we have @xmath206 for almost every @xmath40 , which implies that @xmath177 becomes positive after wave breaking occured .",
    "since all our considerations are based on the description of global conservative solutions , it is not only possible to follow @xmath6 and @xmath23 along characteristics forward in time , but also backwards .",
    "thus a natural question that arises in this context , is , if we can find out how a solution behaves after wave breaking .",
    "following the same lines as before one can show that @xmath207 to be a lit more explicit , one looks at the differential equation backwards in time for some initial data @xmath208 with @xmath209 and compares it with the solution of with @xmath190 backwards in time .",
    "one then obtains that @xmath210 as long as @xmath177 is well - defined .",
    "finally , @xmath192 will provide us with an upper bound on how much time has past since wave breaking occured for the points under consideration .",
    "last but not least there is one important remark .",
    "we assumed throughout all considerations that wave breaking means that @xmath6 becomes unbounded from below along characteristics , but why can @xmath6 not tend to @xmath211 along characteristics forward in time ?",
    "implies that @xmath212 as long as @xmath177 is well - defined .",
    "( _ ii _ ) : if @xmath213 ( the case @xmath214 is similar ) , we get from that @xmath215 and hence @xmath216 for all @xmath169 .",
    "in particular , we see that @xmath217 increases if @xmath177 is negative and @xmath217 decreases if @xmath177 is positive .",
    "note additionally that @xmath217 remains finite on some interval @xmath34 $ ] , if @xmath177 is bounded from below on @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we now want to show that no wave breaking can occur in this case .",
    "let us assume the opposite .",
    "namely , @xmath177 becomes unbounded from below within finite time for some fixed @xmath40 .",
    "denote by @xmath115 the first time when wave breaking occurs , then @xmath218 moreover , implies that either @xmath219 is positive and finite or @xmath220    since the right hans side of depends on @xmath221 , @xmath222 and the uniformly bounded function @xmath223 , we are going to investigate the interplay between @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "therefore consider the function @xmath224 which is bounded from below by @xmath73 .",
    "according to , we have @xmath225 since @xmath226 as @xmath227 , there exists a time @xmath228 , such that @xmath229 , that is @xmath230 and @xmath231 for all @xmath232 .",
    "note that the last inequality implies that @xmath233 for all @xmath232 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath234 is finite and strictly positive due to and .",
    "combining now and , yields that the function @xmath235 is decreasing on the interval @xmath236 , since @xmath177 is negative for all @xmath237 .",
