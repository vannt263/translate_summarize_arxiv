    "the kg equation with electromagnetic field becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the electromagnetic vector potential , @xmath16 is the electromagnetic charge of the particle , and @xmath17 is the complex unit .. hence , some authors @xcite change the definition of @xmath10 by a term proportional to @xmath18 so that newly defined current density has zero divergence . however , it is unclear whether a fix is needed .",
    "as is , current conservation already holds for scattering systems and stationary states ( i.e. , @xmath19 is constant at infinity ) , and situations where the electromagnetic field vanished at infinity . ]",
    "the probabilistic , quantum - mechanical interpretation of the kg equation met with difficulties ; e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . for this reason",
    ", the kg equation was regarded with skepticism in the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "subsequent work , providing an alternate interpretation @xcite and showing that the schrdinger equation can be obtained as the non - relativistic limit of the kg equation @xcite , revived interest in the kg equation .",
    "there are two major approaches to taking the non - relativistic limit of the kg equation .",
    "one approach proceeds by separating the _ small _ and _ large _ components of the wavefunction ; then particle and antiparticle states , satisfying the schrdinger equation , are identified using the foldy - wouthysen procedure @xcite . in the other approach , one solves for the partial derivative of the wavefunction with respect to time using a square root , which is further expanded in taylor series .",
    "the schdinger equation results in the limit @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "claims are that the two approaches are equivalent @xcite .",
    "more recent work @xcite shows that , in the limit @xmath20 , the system formed by the kg and maxwell equations ( where @xmath10 is interpreted as electric current density and serves as coupling ) yields , as leading order , the schrdinger equation together with the poisson equation for the electric potential , @xmath21 .",
    "a third approach , less popular , is performing the asymptotic expansion when the kinetic energy is much smaller than the rest energy , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the kg equation using initial and final boundary conditions for the scalar field , and touching ground with the schrdinger equation , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "here we re - evaluate the kg equation using a 5d space - time with a space - like fifth dimension that is neither compact nor planckian .",
    "such geometries have been previously studied @xcite .",
    "following kaluza s idea @xcite , it has been shown that , if the 5d geometry is independent of the fifth coordinate , the 5d gravitational equations break into 4d equations for the gravitational and electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore a discussion of geodesic motion and classical tests of 4d general relativity adapted to this 5d space - time geometry are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , our interpretation of the 5d geometry @xcite is different from that of other authors .",
    "we assume that an observer perceives 4d geometrically , which , in principle , could be any four dimensions out of five , while the extra dimension manifests indirectly .",
    "hence , in our case , the relation between our theory and experiment does not follow the paved way of the classical tests of general relativity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used a 5d space - time to show both how the kg equation emerges from a relativistic path integral ( sec .  5 ) , and the schrdinger equation emerges from the non - relativistic limit of the same path integral ( sec .  3.2 ) .",
    "here we demonstrate explicitly that the schrdinger equation results by taking the non - relativistic limit of the kg equation .",
    "we reinterpret the kg equation , revisiting its probabilistic , quantum - mechanical interpretation .",
    "we postulate that , given a space - time with the metric @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 go over 4 out of the 5 values @xmath26to be specified  and @xmath27 ) , all quantum propagation takes place on 5d null paths .",
    "consider any two causally ordered events 1 and 2 , with 1 in the past of 2 , which we write as @xmath28 .",
    "denote the coordinates of 1 and 2 by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "then , the sum over 5d null paths between 1 and 2 , denoted here by @xmath31 , is positively defined , conformally invariant , and has the status of a microcanonical sum , determining the particle propagation between 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "null path integrals satisfy a selfconsistency relation virtue to their geometric interpretation @xmath32    we postulate that observers perceive geometrically only four dimensions ; the fifth dimension ( e.g. , @xmath33 , @xmath3 , etc . ) manifests indirectly through its consequences .",
    "thus , a complete description of the physics in the 5d space - time requires measurements of additional entities than 4d space - time events .",
    "the interpretation of the 5d space - time by a 4d observer is greatly facilitated by symmetry .",
    "in particular , if the 5d geometry has a space - like killing vector then the 5d physics can be interpreted as a 4d quantum mechanics , while if the 5d geometry has a time - like killing vector then the 5d geometry can be interpreted as a 4d statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "starting from eq .  , we gave a heuristic derivation for how 5d null path integrals satisfy the following partial differential equation @xcite @xmath34 in a flat 5d space - time with the metric @xmath35 in pseudocartesian coordinates @xmath36 ; @xmath37 stood for the partial derivative with respect to @xmath30 .",

    "obtaining equations similar to for path integrals in arbitrary curved space - times is cumbersome .",
    "here we extend the discussion to a special class of 5d space - times that can be foliated into conformally flat 4d space - times ( i.e. , the 4d conformal factor is the inverse square lapse of the foliation ) with superimposed electromagnetic fields , fit for describing many experimental setups .",
    "these space - times represent just local approximations of more realistic geometric constructs including non - trivial gravitational fields , whose metrics satisfy suitable field equations @xcite .",
    "hence , one should be cautious of anomalies that may result from certain choices of electromagnetic fields .    removing the conformal factor from the metric as it is irrelevant for null - path counting , we have @xmath39 where the @xmath40 indices go over @xmath41 and",
    "are raised with @xmath42 .",
    "this space - time is obtained from the 5d flat one through a non - holonomic transformation of coordinates @xmath43 if @xmath44 is integrable , then the coordinate transformation is holonomic ; i.e. , the space - time remains flat , containing an electromagnetic field that is pure gauge .",
    "in the lorentz gauge , applying transformation to eq .",
    "yields @xmath45 we further note that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the covariant derivative corresponding to the metric @xmath48 ( see appendix [ ap:2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the 5d kg equation can be summarized in covariant fashion using 5d parallel transport alone @xmath49    a 5d covariant probabilistic interpretation of eq .   for the propagation of a single quantum particle",
    "remains challenging .",
    "however , a scalar probability density can be naturally defined .",
    "first , we note that the 5d null path intregrals @xmath31 are positively defined for all pairs of events 1 and 2 , @xmath28 .",
    "second , eq .   is formally identical to the selfconsistency relation of a conditional probability .",
    "hence , up to proper normalization , we may intrepret @xmath31 as the conditional probability that a particle at event 1 reaches event 2 . the probability density",
    "that the particle is at event 2 is thus given by @xmath50\\left[\\int\\limits_{j_+(2)}\\sqrt{|h|}d^5x_{(3)}{\\mathcal r}(x^a_{(2 ) } , x^a_{(3)})\\right]}{\\iint\\limits_{\\forall 1\\prec 3}|h|d^5x_{(1)}d^5x_{(3)}{\\mathcal r}(x^a_{(1 ) } , x^a_{(3)})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 denote the causal future and past of event 2 , respectively .",
    "however , it is impossible to construct a probability 5-current density having this scalar field as its zeroth component .",
    "the quantum mechanics picture of the 5d propagation applies in the case where the 5d metric is @xmath33-independent .",
    "computing the path integral @xmath31 in the 5d lorentzian manifold with the metric @xmath48 is now equivalent to computing the following integral @xmath52\\exp\\left[i\\lambda^{-1}\\int_{x^\\mu_{(1)}}^{x^\\mu_{(2)}}\\left(\\pm\\sqrt{-\\eta_{\\mu \\nu}dx^\\mu dx^\\nu}-\\frac{q}{c^2}a_\\rho dx^\\rho\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of paths between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the 4d projections of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , in a 4d non - lorentzian curved manifold with infinitesimal distance @xmath55 if the two neighboring events are causally ordered and @xmath56 if they are inverse causally ordered @xcite .",
    "hence , computing the path integral @xmath57 is equivalent to computing @xmath58 @xcite , where @xmath11 is symbol for complex conjugation .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath59 is not a scalar field on the 4d manifold since a transformation of coordinates that reverses causality implies a complex conjugation of @xmath59 .",
    "a differential equation for @xmath60 is obtained by fourier transforming eq .  , which results in the 4d kg equation for a particle in electromagnetic field .",
    "the probability density of localizing the quantum particle at a 4d space - time event may be constructed starting from the sum over loops in the 4d manifold @xmath61 note that @xmath62 is invariant under gauge transformations of the electromagnetic field and , just like @xmath63 , satisfies the self - consistency relation of conditional probability @xmath64 virtue to its geometrical interpretation .",
    "hence , the probability density that a particle undergoing causal propagation is localized at the 4d event @xmath54 may be defined as @xmath65 and the probability density that a particle undergoing anti - causal propagation is localized at the 4d event @xmath53 may be defined as @xmath66 however , like in sec .",
