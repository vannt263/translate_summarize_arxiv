    "the thermal energy content of the hot interstellar ( ism ) or the intracluster medium ( icm ) pervading galaxies or their groups and clusters can be probed with the sunyaev - zeldovich ( 1980 , sz ) effect .",
    "this arises when the hot electrons compton upscatter some of the cmb photons crossing the structure ; then the black body spectrum is tilted toward higher frequencies .    in the @xmath0wave band",
    "the tilt mimics a diminution @xmath1 k of the cmb temperature , proportional to the comptonization parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this is evenly contributed by the electron density @xmath3 and the temperature @xmath4 ; in fact , what matters is the electron pressure @xmath5 integrated along a line of sight ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath6    to now , sz signals have been measured in many rich clusters at levels @xmath7 or @xmath8 mk ( see rephaeli 1995 ; birkinshaw 1999 ; zhang & wu 2000 ; reese et al .",
    "these levels are consistent with icm temperatures @xmath9 kev , sizes @xmath10 of a few mpcs , and central densities @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "similar values are indicated by the standard cluster view based on gravitational potential wells of virial depth @xmath13 dominated by the mass @xmath14 of the dark matter ( dm ) . in such wells icm masses @xmath15 are settled in hydrostatic equilibrium at specific energies @xmath16 .",
    "the above values also fit in with the x - ray luminosities @xmath17 ergs s@xmath18 emitted through thermal bremsstrahlung by the icm .",
    "groups , on the other hand , are underluminous relative to clusters ; they emit far less than the baseline level @xmath19 scaled at constant @xmath15 after the dm rules . the observed @xmath20 correlation is clearly steeper , and goes from @xmath21 in clusters to @xmath22 or @xmath23 in poor groups , albeit with a wide variance ( osullivan , ponman & collins 2003 ) .",
    "in other words , the icm in groups appears to be underdense compared to clusters .",
    "the origin of such lower densities is currently debated .",
    "one view centers on extensive radiative cooling ( bryan 2000 ) which would remove much low entropy gas .",
    "an alternative line of explanations ( see cavaliere , lapi & menci 2002 , clm02 ; and refs .",
    "therein ) focuses on the energy injections affecting the icm equilibrium while the dm is hierarchically accrued over dynamical timescales @xmath24 .",
    "the inputs are provided when the baryons in galaxies condense to form stars possibly in starbursts , which then explode as sne ; alternatively or correlatedly ( menci et al .",
    "2003 , in prep . ) , the baryons accrete onto supermassive black holes ( bhs ) energizing active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "such feedback actions deplete the icm density in the shallower potential wells by causing from inside thermal outflow and dynamical blowout ; they also preheat the gas exterior to the newly forming structures , and so hinder its inflow .    in any case",
    ", for groups in _ equilibrium _ the values of @xmath25 can be anticipated from the continuum @xmath26 through the model - independent relation ( cavaliere & menci 2001 ) @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the baseline value scaled to the formation redshift @xmath29 ( cole & kaiser 1988 ) .",
    "so for groups where @xmath30 holds we expect _ depressed _ @xmath25 .    are _ enhanced _ sz effects also possible , or even likely ?",
    "what can these tell about the processes affecting @xmath3 and @xmath4 in groups and galaxies ? here we propose that a specific answer will come from sz observations .",
    "we start from recasting @xmath31 in terms of the gas thermal energy @xmath32 at equilibrium . a small group or an early massive galaxy with their virial temperatures @xmath33 or @xmath34 kev would produce sz signals @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "larger energies @xmath37 added to the icm / ism are expected to enhance the sz signals yielding @xmath38 .",
    "such may be the case with the agns ( see valageas & silk 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ; roychowdhury & nath 2002 ) that produce large total outputs , typically around @xmath39 ergs over times around @xmath40 yr comparable to @xmath24 of their host structures .",
    "such outputs can drive a blastwave sweeping out the gas mass and raising its pressure ( see platania et al .",
    "2002 ; also yamada & fujita 2001 ) .",
    "we will see that the blast is _ constrained _ by the coupling of the agn outputs to the surrounding gas , and _ restrained _ by the initial pressure and the dm gravity .",
    "we describe the blast flow on using the self - similar hydrodynamical solutions presented by clm02 .",
    "the simplest one obtains when the energy @xmath41 is delivered over times of order @xmath24 at the center of an isothermal configuration for the dm and for the gas with @xmath42 . then the leading shock moves out with uniform mach number @xmath43 , i.e. , with radius @xmath44 ; the kinetic , the thermal and the gravitational energies of the perturbed gas all scale like @xmath45 .",
    "so we can consistently define inside @xmath45 the total initial energy @xmath46 ( modulus ) ; most important , our solutions provide realistic predictions not only for _ strong _ blasts but also for the _ weak _ ones driven by constrained values of @xmath47 .",
    "detailed profiles are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "note that the perturbed flow is confined to a shell ; this is bounded by the leading shock at @xmath45 , and by a trailing contact surface ( `` piston '' ) located at @xmath48 where the density diverges weakly while the pressure is finite .",
    "so the relevant quantities may be also obtained from the simple and precise `` shell approximation '' ( see ostriker & mckee 1988 ) , which provides the energy balance in the form @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the mean pressure within the shell volume @xmath51 , important for the sz signals ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the dm and the gas masses within @xmath45 .",

    "the fractional energy @xmath63 coupled to the surrounding gas is poorly known .",
    "including inefficiencies due to low momentum transfer , non - spherical geometries and covering factors it may range from @xmath64 for radio - quiet , to some @xmath62 for strongly absorbed ( bal ) or radio - loud quasars , a small minority .",

    "table  1 presents quantities relevant to our computations of sz signals .",
    "we have extended our basic solution to initial density runs @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "then the initial temperature declines as @xmath69 , and the shock decelerates as @xmath70 , again under self - similarity ; this also implies declining source luminosities with @xmath71 . table  1",
    "shows that larger @xmath72 yields somewhat higher @xmath43 and @xmath73 at given @xmath66 .",
    "in computing how @xmath25 is _ enhanced _ during the blast transit , we focus on @xmath74 averaged over the structure area , which will subtend small angles @xmath75 for an early group or galaxy . normalizing the shock position as @xmath76 , we find the full signal @xmath77 in terms of @xmath78 .",

    "this may be described by @xmath121 for a nearly isothermal icm in the ( normalized ) dm potential well @xmath122 , see cavaliere & fusco - femiano ( 1976 ) .",
    "the blast heats up the gas so decreasing the value of the parameter @xmath123 , that we reset on using @xmath4 averaged over the mass in the shell .",
    "the blast also ejects gas and depletes all densities ; we reset @xmath124 by requiring the volume integral of @xmath97 to equal the gas mass left by the blast inside @xmath10 at @xmath125 .",

    "we recall from clm02 that the equilibrium also provides good fits to the observed @xmath26 in groups for the _ same _ coupling @xmath65 , consistent with eq .",
    "this letter centers on how the sz effect is affected by the energy fed back by agns into the surrounding gas .",
    "we predict both transient , _ enhanced _ and long - term , _ depressed _ sz signals to be produced by an energy addition @xmath59 to the equilibrium value @xmath46 .",
    "in @xmath126 kev groups the condition @xmath127 holds , and the agn feedback has a considerable impact .",
    "a blast is driven through the gas ; during its transit the area - averaged sz signal is enhanced as the gas is just redistributed while its pressure is _",
    "raised_. but eventually a considerable gas fraction is _ ejected _ ; so @xmath3 is depleted and @xmath128 is decreased at equilibrium . we have computed these effects under the _ restraints _ set to ( weak ) blast propagation by initial pressure and dm gravity .",

    "3 . with angular sizes @xmath110",
    ", these may be diluted down to @xmath134 @xmath135k when observed at a resolution around @xmath129 .",
    "such resolutions will be achieved by several instruments now being built or designed , enabling `` blind '' sky surveys for sz signals to @xmath0k sensitivities over tens of square degrees ( see carlstrom , holder & reese 2002 ) .",
    "in particular , promising perspectives are offered by multi - beam , high frequency radio receivers like ocra ( browne et al . 2000 ) , and also by interferometers equipped with wide - band correlators like atca , sza ( holder et al . 2000 ) , ami ( jones 2002 ) , and amiba ( lo 2002 ) .",
    "the sz signals we consider may contribute equally or more than clusters to the excess power already detected at high multipoles with bima ( dawson et al .",
    ". in the ( sub)millimetric band the sz signal is positive , and will be accessible to large bolometer arrays like bolocam , whose developments will enable deep , wide surveys ( mauskopf et al .",
    "eventually , alma ( http://www.alma.nrao.edu/ ) will provide in selected areas higher resolution for both sides of the sz effect .",
    "enhanced signals as discussed here would constitute _ signatures _ of strong feedback caught in the act .",
    "this is specific of agns , since sne feed back at most @xmath136 kev / particle ( see clm02 ) ; on the other hand , extended cooling which depletes @xmath3 without increasing @xmath4 hardly could enhance @xmath128 .",
