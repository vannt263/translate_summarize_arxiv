    "the age and space density of the oldest and most massive galaxies at each epoch provide the strongest constraints on models of galaxy formation .",
    "this is one of main reasons that there has been so much focus on extremely red objects ( eros ) .",
    "it is the high - redshift systems that are most important for testing models , and the ero selection criterion is designed to find old , passively evolving galaxies at @xmath13 . because the 4000  break in evolved galaxies shifts from optical to near - infrared at @xmath13 , eros are defined in terms of optical to near - infrared color , with two of the most used definitions being @xmath14 and @xmath15 mag .    the co - moving volume density , or even the number density , of massive",
    ", evolved galaxies at @xmath16 can place strong constraints on models of galaxy formation .",
    "whereas monolithic collapse models @xcite predict pure luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies from the period of formation until the present - day , hierarchical formation models @xcite predict significant density evolution from @xmath12 to @xmath17 . testing the models",
    "has proven to be difficult , and the results are not yet conclusive .",
    "some surveys have found a deficit of early - type galaxies at @xmath12 @xcite whereas others have not @xcite .",
    "part of the disagreement may be caused by the strong clustering of eros on the sky @xcite , and large fields must be surveyed in order to overcome this problem .",
    "the ero definition also selects dusty starburst galaxies whose spectral energy distribution can mimic those of old , passively evolving galaxies .",
    "it is still unclear how large a fraction of the ero population consists of dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "several methods are being used to separate the two galaxy types , including photometric @xcite , spectroscopic @xcite , and those based on morphology @xcite .",
    "the results so far seem to suggest that roughly two - thirds of the eros at @xmath18 mag are old , passively evolving galaxies .",
    "however , it is also clear that the situation is more complex than just a simple distinction into old , evolved galaxies and dusty starbursts since systems with old populations and residual star formation also appear in ero samples @xcite .    in this paper , we are concerned with eros in the fields of high - redshift quasars .",
    "some early studies serendipitously found eros in the fields of @xmath19 radio galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "although some of these eros were later shown to lie in the foreground of the radio galaxies @xcite , probing the fields around high - redshift radio - loud agn ( active galactic nuclei ) has been a promising method of finding high - redshift galaxies .",
    "luminous quasars and radio galaxies are often associated with high - density galaxy environments @xcite , and the rich environments are often interpreted as clusters or groups of galaxies hosting the agn . by combining a targeted search with a color criterion like that of eros , high - redshift early - type galaxies can be effectively filtered out from the numerous foreground galaxies .",
    "this becomes very important at high redshifts , since even for a rich cluster at @xmath12 , most of the galaxies observed using a single broad - band filter are foreground or background galaxies @xcite .",
    "a few surveys have found that eros seem to be more common in high - redshift agn fields than in the general field @xcite , and there are individual agn fields which show striking overdensities of eros @xcite .    even though galaxy excess in the fields of agn are often being interpreted as groups or clusters physically associated with the agn ( spectroscopically confirmed in a few cases @xcite ) , gravitational lensing",
    "is also known to cause correlations ( and anti - correlations ) between high - redshift quasars and optically bright foreground galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a similar situation could arise between high - redshift quasars ( @xmath20 ) and eros , because the eros are likely to be tracers of massive structures which may boost the fluxes of distant background quasars by gravitational lensing .",
    "the aim with our present study is to test whether eros are more common in the fields of @xmath20 quasars . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first systematic survey to probe the surface density of eros in the fields of quasars at @xmath19 , and preliminary results were reported by @xcite .",
    "the quasars in our sample are selected from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite , and form a subset of a larger sample of 40 designed to study host galaxies ( armus et al .   in preparation ) .",
    "the 40 sample quasars are nearly evenly divided between radio - loud and radio - quiet systems with comparable @xmath21 magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "the subsample of 13 analyzed here were selected randomly from the sample of 40 and followed up with wide - field near - infrared and optical imaging .",
    "the sample is listed in table  [ table : t1 ] . in this table , we have also listed the radio loudness , defined in terms of the ratio of the flux densities at rest - frame 5 ghz and 2500  , @xmath22 @xcite . according to the definition by @xcite ,",
    "a quasar is radio - loud if @xmath23 , and thus two of the 13 quasars are classified as radio - quiet ( one of these might be radio - intermediate instead of radio - quiet ) whereas the rest are radio - loud . in calculating the radio loudness",
    ", we used the @xmath24-band fluxes of the quasars as found from our data , and the radio fluxes at 5 ghz listed in the catalog of @xcite unless otherwise is noted in the table .",
    "the @xmath24-band fluxes were converted to rest - frame 2500  by assuming a power - law spectrum , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 was found from the median quasar energy distribution by @xcite .",
    "the conversion to rest - frame 5 ghz radio flux was done by assuming the same power - law form of the spectrum , but using spectral indices listed in the catalog by @xcite , unless otherwise is noted in the table .",

    "the cosmic instrument is equipped with a 2048@xmath302048 tektronix ccd with a pixel scale of 0.2856 arcsec , and the pfircam employs a 256@xmath30256 hgcdte array with a pixel scale of 0.494 arcsec .",
    "the resulting fields of view in @xmath29 and @xmath24 are therefore 9.7@xmath309.7 and 2.1@xmath302.1 arcmin@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "images were obtained during several observing runs from september 1995 to july 2001 .",
    "we used a 9- or 27-point dither pattern for the @xmath24 images , and on - chip integration times of 4 sec .",
    "the number of co - adds was set so that the total integration time at each dither point was 2030 sec , and the offsets between individual frames were typically 1015 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath29-band exposures were divided into integrations of 300600 sec each , with an offset of 1020 arcsec between each exposure . the total integration time in @xmath29 and @xmath24 for each field is listed in table  [ table : t1 ] .",
    "flat - field images in @xmath24 were made by taking the median of dark - subtracted quasar images .",
    "typically , a flat - field was made for each dither sequence , and this was found to be sufficient in most cases . after flat - fielding , the images were sky subtracted , corrected for bad pixels and registered using the dimsum package @xcite within iraf .",
    "the sky subtraction in dimsum is performed by subtracting a running sky frame made by taking the median of nine neighboring images .",
    "after the sky subtraction , masks are created for objects and cosmic rays and the masks are utilized to make a first pass combined image . the first pass image is then used to make a new and improved mask by including fainter objects .",
    "the new object mask is used in the final pass where the sky subtraction is repeated and the images aligned and combined . at this final step ,",
    "we block replicated the images by a factor of two so that sub - pixel shifts were used for the aligning .",
    "the resulting images therefore have a pixel scale of 0.247 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath29-band images were reduced in iraf in a standard manner .",
    "the bias level was subtracted either by using a bias frame or by using a 3rd order legendre to fit the overscan region which was then subtracted from each row . a flat - field was formed for each quasar field by taking the median of the quasar images , or of the quasar images in combination with exposures of other fields taken near in time . typically 1530 frames were used for this , and all emission @xmath32 above the average background was masked out .",
    "this method rejected cosmic rays , stars and galaxies visible in the quasar images and yielded a high quality flat - field frame .",
    "the flat - fielded images were then aligned using 2040 stars in each frame , and averaged using _ imcombine _ with a high threshold set to remove bad pixels that had been flagged by giving them high , discrepant values .",

    "geotran_.    the flux calibration of the @xmath29-band images was accomplished using standard stars from @xcite , and the @xmath24-data were calibrated using standard stars from @xcite .",
    "the conditions were photometric , and the transparency good throughout most of the runs .",
    "the final photometric status was checked by the amount of variation within the individual exposures of the same source and by following standard stars throughout the night . for fields that were imaged during non - photometric conditions ,",
    "calibration images were obtained later during photometric conditions to allow for an accurate flux calibration . during the photometric nights , the zeropoint varied by less than 0.1 mag . for a subset of the images , we checked our absolute photometry against the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "1997 ; cutri et al . ) . a very good agreement , typically @xmath33 mag difference , was found between our @xmath24-magnitudes and the 2mass @xmath24-magnitudes for bright stars of @xmath34 mag .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the seeing in the @xmath24-images is 0.81.0 arcsec , and in the @xmath29-images , typically 1.01.5 arcsec .",

    "the 3@xmath38 detection limits in the images are @xmath39 and @xmath40 mag .",
    "we address the completeness of the images in the next section .",
    "for object detection and photometry we used the sextractor software package @xcite . in order to have the same fwhm of the seeing in both @xmath29 and @xmath24 we convolved the @xmath24-band images with a gaussian function using the iraf task _ gauss _ prior to object detection . for each field ,",
    "object catalogs were constructed based on the detections in the @xmath24-band image . during the detection process , we used a gaussian convolution filter with a fwhm matched to the seeing and a detection threshold of 1.5@xmath38 .",
    "since the images were block replicated , we set the minimum number of pixels above the threshold to 20 in order to avoid spurious detections and cosmic rays over an area of less than 5 pixels in the original images .",
    "the result of the detection process was inspected visually in order to ensure that no obvious objects were missed , and that no false detections were entered into the catalogs .",
    "saturated objects and objects lying close to the image boundaries were rejected from the catalogs .     in the @xmath24-filter .",

    "the horizontal line indicates our ero definition , and the diagonal line the @xmath43 mag limit .",
    "the scatter of objects above the diagonal line arises from the varying depths of the @xmath29-band images .",
    "[ figure : fig1 ] ]    because of the dithering technique used in the @xmath24-band , the exposure time falls off toward the edges in the final combined images .",
    "since the pfircam field of view is relatively small , we included lower exposure regions , but rejected the regions where the exposure time is less than 25 % of the total , i.e.  where the signal - to - noise drops by more than 50 % .",
    "this causes the rms background noise to increase toward the edges , resulting in a number of spurious detections . in order to avoid such spurious detections",

    "this allows for an adjustment of the detection threshold according to the noise level .",
    "after the @xmath24-catalogs were made , matched @xmath29-band catalogs were created by running sextractor in double image mode .",
    "this produces a catalog of fluxes measured in the @xmath29-band image , but using the @xmath24-band image for detection . for total magnitudes",
    ", we used the sextractor _",
    "best _ magnitudes which are evaluated using adaptive apertures , or using isophotal corrections if a neighbor is suspected of biasing the adaptive aperture magnitude @xcite . for determining colors , we used aperture magnitudes , and chose an aperture diameter of two times the fwhm of the seeing , corresponding to typically 910 pixels , or 2.22.5 arcsec .    for each @xmath24-selected object , we calculated the detection significance using the uncertainty in the flux as measured by sextractor which takes into account the poissonian nature of the counts and the standard deviation in the background counts .",
    "in addition to this , we added in quadrature the error arising from the fluctuating background level across the image @xcite . in order for a @xmath24-selected object to be included in the catalog we required the detection significance within the aperture",
    "to be @xmath44 .",
    "if the flux measured within the corresponding aperture in the @xmath29-band was significant at the @xmath45 level , we evaluated the @xmath42 color , and if @xmath41 , a lower limit to the @xmath42 color was calculated assuming a @xmath46 detection in @xmath29 .    in order to separate stars and galaxies",
    ", we used the star - galaxy classifier in sextractor which assigns a probability between 0 and 1 to an object according to how likely it is to be a star .",
    "the star - galaxy classifier works well , but becomes less reliable at faint magnitudes .",
    "we therefore performed star - galaxy separation only at @xmath47 mag , rejecting objects with a star - galaxy class of @xmath48 from the catalogs .",
    "the star - galaxy separation was based on the detections in the @xmath24 images .      to be able to address the completeness of the @xmath24-band catalogs , we added artificial galaxies to the images using the iraf task _",
    "mkobjects_. for a given input magnitude , we added galaxies with both devaucouleurs and exponential disk profiles , in total @xmath49 galaxies distributed over the 13 fields .",
    "the scale - lengths of the artificial galaxies were randomly selected from the fwhm of the objects in the catalogs , and the images convolved with the same gaussian function as was used to put the @xmath24-band images to the seeing of the @xmath29-band images .",
    "after this , the images were processed through sextractor using the same detection criteria as described above .",
    "the simulations show that for input objects of @xmath50 mag , 96 % of the galaxies are recovered , where the missing 4 % is due to blending with other objects . at @xmath51 mag",
    "the completeness drops to 90 % , and at @xmath52 mag the catalogs are @xmath53 % complete .",
    "the numbers were evaluated assuming a 50:50 mix of devaucouleurs and exponential disk profiles .",
    "we select eros in the quasar fields using the criterion @xmath54 mag .",
    "this includes old , passively evolving galaxies at @xmath55 , but also dusty starbursting galaxies . with only two filters , and at the resolution of our images ,",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between these two galaxy types .",
    "there will also be some contamination by faint , red stars in our ero sample as discussed below .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath56 mag selection criterion because of two reasons .",
    "firstly , because selecting galaxies with red colors enables us to eliminate a large part of the numerous foreground galaxies at @xmath57 while at the same time producing a big enough sample to perform meaningful statistics on . secondly , because several random - field surveys employing the @xmath56 mag criterion exist with which we can compare the ero surface density .",
    "our areal coverage in @xmath29 and @xmath24 is limited by the small field of view of the pfircam instrument , so the field counts can not be estimated from the quasar images themselves .    the color - magnitude diagram of all the @xmath24-selected objects is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig1 ] . above our @xmath54 mag selection",
    "there are 253 objects , and 105 of these have a detection significance in @xmath29 of three or less , i.e.  the lower limit on their @xmath42 color is @xmath58 mag .",
    "the sextractor star - galaxy classifier finds that two of the eros at @xmath47 mag are stars , and these are excluded from the ero sample , resulting in a total of 251 galaxies ( including the @xmath59 detections in @xmath29 having a lower limit of @xmath56 mag ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig2 ] , we have plotted the average cumulative surface density of eros in the quasar fields together with ero surface densities found in the random - field surveys of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . note that we have not compared with field counts derived from other colors ( e.g.  @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) since they may bias toward later - type galaxies with prolonged star formation @xcite .",

    ", corresponds to @xmath63 mag .",
    "the literature surveys cover wide , random areas and should therefore be representative of the ero counts in the general field .",
    "the field counts agree well with each other except for the counts in the chandra deep field south by @xcite , which are consistently lower than the other .",
    "this is most likely caused by the inhomogeneity of the ero distribution coupled with the relatively small ( and contiguous ) area surveyed by scodeggio & silva .",
    "[ figure : fig2 ] demonstrates that the ero counts in our quasar fields are systematically higher than those in the field . at @xmath1 mag , where our counts are complete ,",
    "the average surface density of eros is two  three times larger than the average of the field values ( excluding those in the chandra deep field south ) . according to the average of the random - field surveys , as indicated by the dotted line in fig .",

    "we have demonstrated above that the quasar fields have a significant excess of eros above what is expected from the general field population of eros , taking into account their strong clustering .",
    "it appears that the quasar fields contain clusters or dense concentrations of red galaxies , and their radial distribution suggests that the fainter eros may be related to the quasars .",
    "however , another possibility is that the eros are related to structures in the foreground of the quasars .",
    "we discuss each of these possibilities below .",
    "note that our sample is dominated by radio - loud quasars , and that we restrict the following discussion to radio - loud quasars only .",
    "an argument in favor of the ero excess being at the quasar redshifts is that luminous radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies at @xmath110 are known to reside in regions of enhanced galaxy density , interpreted as clusters or groups of galaxies physically associated with the agn @xcite . since powerful agn with supermassive black holes may trace the densest regions , it is natural to assume that this is true also at @xmath111 .",
    "for example , @xcite find excess eros in radio - loud agn fields at @xmath99 and @xcite find that red galaxies cluster around powerful radio sources at @xmath99 .",
    "our study pushes this out to @xmath111 .",
    "if the ero excess originates in dense environments associated with the quasars , the majority of the eros must lie at @xmath3 since this is the redshift of most of the quasars in our sample .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to discuss whether the color and the brightness of the eros are consistent with being evolved galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "we have used the pgase models of @xcite to examine both the apparent magnitude and the @xmath42 color of passively evolving galaxies at @xmath3 ( assuming no extinction by dust , and an initial metallicity of 1 % solar value ) .",
    "the apparent @xmath24 magnitude of @xmath112 galaxies at @xmath113 was found by calculating the scale factor between the observed flux of the model and that of a present - day @xmath112 galaxy .",
    "the present - day @xmath112 galaxy was assumed to have @xmath114 mag @xcite and an age of 14 gyr .",
    "the standard model in which the stars form in a 1 gyr long burst at @xmath115 has an @xmath42 color at @xmath113 which is too red for most of our eros . in order for this model to produce a color of @xmath116 mag at @xmath113 ,",
    "the formation redshift has to be @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath117 magnitude of such a galaxy observed at @xmath113 is 19.2 mag .",
    "since the star formation in this model stops abruptly after 1 gyr , this model represents the galaxy which reddens most quickly .",
    "therefore , @xmath118 mag is the brightest magnitude we can expect for an @xmath112 galaxy at @xmath113 .",
    "if the @xmath5 mag ero excess is associated with passively evolving galaxies at @xmath3 , they must therefore be @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "other models which have @xmath116 mag at @xmath113 include those with exponentially decreasing star formation rates .",
    "for instance , a galaxy formed at @xmath119 with an exponentially decreasing star formation rate of @xmath120 gyr has @xmath116 mag at @xmath113 , and @xmath121 mag .",
    "if the eros are described by this latter model , they must have small amounts of residual star formation in them .",
    "the recent spectroscopic work of @xcite has shown that red galaxies at @xmath19 can be very bright .",
    "five of their six galaxies were found to lie at @xmath122 and to have @xmath24-magnitudes in the range 19.219.9 mag .",
    "these galaxies were selected by the @xmath123 mag criterion @xcite , whereas our galaxies are selected on the basis of having @xmath56 mag .",
    "both criteria are designed to find galaxies with evolved 4000  breaks , but at different redshifts .",
    "however , these two selection techniques will not necessarily sample the same type of galaxies since the different filters sample different rest - frame wavelength ranges . while the results of van  dokkum et al .",
    "prove that high - redshift red galaxies can be bright , their spectroscopic sample ( six of eleven @xmath124-selected galaxies ) may be biased toward systems with ongoing star formation .",
    "the average ero fraction in our quasar fields is above 20 % , and for the four richest fields in our sample the fraction is as high as @xmath125 % .",
    "this is what we expect if the fields contain clusters or concentrations of galaxies with an already existing relation between morphology and density @xcite .",
    "this is also the suggestion from the work by @xcite who find that red galaxies are concentrated toward @xmath99 powerful radio sources .",
    "whereas the magnitudes and colors of the eros are consistent with models of passively evolving galaxies , another possibility is that they might be starbursting systems reddened by dust .",
    "hence , an alternative explanation is that the quasars live in dense environments dominated by galaxies with enhanced star formation . in this case",
    ", the excess eros may be dusty starburst galaxies , possibly the progenitors of massive ellipticals in a forming cluster .",
    "there are examples of fields around high - redshift radio - loud agn with excesses of starforming galaxies such as ly - alpha emitters @xcite . also ,",
    "@xcite find a concentration of submm sources in the field of the @xmath126 radio galaxy 4c 41.17 raising the possibility that the eros in this field are dusty starburst systems rather than passively evolving galaxies .",
    "this possibility is also discussed by @xcite for a luminous submm source in the field of the radio galaxy 53w002 at @xmath127 .",
    "one might expect a correlation between the radio properties of the quasars and their ero excesses if there is e.g.  a relation between radio power and black hole mass @xcite .",
    "we have checked this for our sample , but do not find that the radio power correlates with the ero excess .",
    "little is known yet of the luminosity function of eros . in the spectroscopic survey by @xcite , which is 67 % complete at @xmath128 mag ,",
    "the @xmath54 mag eros are found to lie at @xmath129 .",
    "the redshift distribution derived by @xcite based on photometric redshifts is in broad agreement with cimatti et al s , but has a tail toward higher redshifts .",
    "if we assume that our ero sample has a redshift distribution similar to that found by cimatti et al .  and miyazaki et al . , we have to explain why the ero surface density in the quasar fields is so significantly different from that in the large random - field surveys .",
    "we are sampling the ero distribution with several small , but widely separated fields , and should therefore be minimally affected by cosmic variance .",
    "instead , the opposite seems to be the case ; the quasar fields sample the densest regions in the ero distribution",
    ". a large number of the quasar fields contain clumps of eros , similar to what is seen only in the densest areas in the large random - field surveys .",
    "if the eros have a peak redshift of @xmath130 , they must therefore be clusters of galaxies , or overdensities in the ero distribution , lying along the lines of sight to the quasars .",
    "a biasing of quasar lines of sight with respect to @xmath12 overdensities in the ero distribution can be explained by gravitational lensing .",
    "if we assume that the overdensities in the quasar fields do not extend much beyond the edges of the fields their typical scale is @xmath131 arcmin , corresponding to 23 einstein radii for galaxy clusters at @xmath132 .",
    "the most efficient lens redshift for a quasar at @xmath113 is 0.50.6 , but a magnification can still occur if the lens lies at @xmath133 .",
    "the quasars in our sample are very luminous , eight of them have @xmath134 mag ( @xmath135 kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 ) , and hence classify as highly luminous quasars .",
    "they therefore fulfill the three criteria for maximizing the probability of a magnification bias , i.e.  they are distant , bright and have a steep number - magnitude slope ( claeskens & surdej 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "if a magnification bias is the explanation for our results , we might expect that the fields around the most luminous quasars contain the highest overdensities of eros , but our data do not show any significant correlations between quasar luminosity and ero surface density to support this .",
    "furthermore , if the majority of the eros are associated with overdensities along the line of sight to the quasars , we might expect the spectra of the quasars in the richest fields to have strong ( rest - frame equivalent width @xmath136  ) metal absorption line systems @xcite .",
    "we have found absorption line data for seven of the 13 quasars in our sample @xcite .",
    "two of the four richest fields have such data ; q2150@xmath27053 show no strong metal absorption lines and q2338@xmath27042 have civ and feii at @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "other quasars with metal absorption line systems in the foreground is q0830@xmath27115 with feii at @xmath138 and mgii at @xmath139 @xcite , q0941@xmath27261 with mgii systems at @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and q1354@xmath27258 with mgii at @xmath142 and some weaker feii and mgii systems at @xmath143 @xcite , but these quasars lie in fields with relatively few eros compared to the richer fields .",
    "the data for q0758@xmath27120 and q1629@xmath27680 show no strong metal absorption line systems @xcite .",
    "there is thus no clear trend of increasing number of absorption line systems with ero richness .",
    "also , the quasars in our sample were not selected on the basis of having strong or numerous absorption line systems .",
    "on the average , the quasar fields studied here have a cumulative surface density of eros at @xmath78 , 18.5 and 19 mag which is two - three times larger than what is found in the general field .",
    "the excess is significant at the @xmath2 level even after taking into account that the ero distribution is strongly clustered .",
    "there is also an excess of eros at fainter magnitudes , but at @xmath36 mag our counts become strongly affected by incompleteness and a secure quantitative estimate of the excess for @xmath144 mag is difficult .",
    "however , by making a correction for the incompleteness , we find that the ero excess at @xmath145 and @xmath101 mag may also be significant at the @xmath146 level .",
    "the quasar fields are small , typically 2.1@xmath302.1 arcmin@xmath31 ( limited by the near - infrared field of view ) , but widely separated , and therefore sample the ero population with minimal influence from cosmic variance .",
    "the fact that the excess is statistically significant therefore suggests that the quasar fields probe the densest regions in the ero distribution , implying that the fields around luminous , high - redshift quasars are on the average , overdense in eros .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the observed overdensities .",
    "( 1 ) the majority of the eros may be associated with concentrations of galaxies at the quasar redshifts , or ( 2 ) the eros lie in the foreground , along the line of sight to the quasars .    based on both spectroscopic observations of @xmath19 red galaxies @xcite and spectral synthesis models @xcite , we argue that a redshift of @xmath3 for the eros is plausible . the @xmath5 mag ero excess may therefore be physically associated with the quasars , in which case their magnitudes and colors are consistent with @xmath6 passively evolving galaxies .",
    "the eros at @xmath147 mag are more clustered in the immediate 20 arcsec region around the quasars , hence the radial distribution supports the explanation that the fainter eros are physically associated with the quasars .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of eros among the @xmath24-selected galaxies in the quasar fields is unusually high , typically 2025 % , in contrast to @xmath109 % which is found in random - field surveys @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the ero excess being associated with dense concentrations of red , possibly evolved , galaxies .",
    "the high ero fractions may therefore indicate that a morphology - density relation @xcite exists in the quasar fields .",
    "the candidate ero clusters in the quasar fields may therefore represent the oldest and most evolved systems at @xmath20 , and will be crucial for testing models of structure and galaxy formation . if the ero excess is dominated by dusty starforming galaxies instead of passively evolving galaxies , the eros might be the progenitors of massive ellipticals in a forming cluster associated with the quasars .    the second explanation , that the ero excess lies in the foreground , is equally interesting because it implies that the lines of sight toward high - redshift , luminous quasars are biased toward overdensities in the ero distribution . in this case , the ero excess is most likely associated with clusters of galaxies at @xmath12 giving rise to a magnification bias of the quasars . in this interpretation",
    ", we would be seeing candidate clusters with passively evolving galaxies at @xmath12 , a redshift where still only less than a handful of clusters are known .",
    "however , we see no trend of quasar brightness with ero overdensity as might be expected in this interpretation . also , there is no association of the numbers of absorption line systems with ero richness for seven of the 13 quasars with absorption line data .    with the current data ,",
    "it is not possible to tell whether the ero excess is part of a small - scale overdensity centered on , or lying close to , the quasars , or if it is part of a larger structure that extends over a wider area . to address this issue ,",
    "we have begun an imaging program using @xmath148- and @xmath24-filters at the palomar 200-inch telescope over much larger fields . with these data",
