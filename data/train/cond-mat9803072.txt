    "the sandpile model introduced by bak , tang and wiesenfeld @xcite serves not only as a lapidary formulation of basic principles of self - organized criticality ( soc ) but also seems to be an appropriate candidate for exact determination of all important critical exponents .",
    "indeed , the first steps following dhar s discovery @xcite of the abelian structure of the sandpile model were encouraging .",
    "they include determination of the total number of allowed configurations in the recurrent state @xcite , evaluation of the height probabilities @xcite and height - height correlation functions @xcite , interpretation of the inverse laplacian operator @xmath0 as an expected number of topplings at a given site due to a particle added to another one @xcite . nevertheless , all analytical results obtained up to now catch either static properties of the recurrent state or diffusion - like dynamics of individual particles .",
    "the avalanche dynamics as such , responsible for soc , slips off the analytical description even in the simplified limiting case of large avalanches .",
    "the main obstruction is that existing renormalization group methods @xcite neglect essential peculiarities of the toppling process , and the complicated spatio - temporal structure of avalanches prevents exact evaluation of the critical exponents .    to advance the analysis of avalanche dynamics , various decompositions of avalanches in the abelian sandpile model ( asm ) into more elementary objects have been proposed . in particular , grassberger and manna",
    "noticed @xcite that each avalanche can be represented as a set of embedded clusters of sites related to a given number of topplings . to make use of this construction for determination of critical exponents",
    "it is desirable to obtain a dynamical procedure which naturally divides the avalanche into a collection of clusters .",
    "it means that due to the abelian property of toppling operators , one can try to change the order of topplings so that each avalanche would expand to the largest cluster and then contract by smaller and smaller sets of toppling sites . in our previous works",
    "@xcite we made such an attempt proposing a decomposition of avalanches into waves of topplings .",
    "the main feature of the wave structure of avalanches is a possibility to set up a one - to - one correspondence between waves and two - rooted spanning trees @xcite . using the spanning tree representation for waves , one can apply the methods of graph theory to calculate the critical exponents of wave and avalanche statistics @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been found out @xcite that the set of waves and the set of clusters for a particular avalanche do not coincide .",
    "namely , waves have such an irrelevancy in their superimposing that the next wave can overlap the previous one and the package of waves does not form embedded sets of sites like clusters . the observations of dhar and manna @xcite and our simulations on small lattices raise hope that the overlappings of waves are relatively rare events .",
    "we have assumed @xcite that one can neglect the difference between clusters and waves of topplings and consider each next wave embedded into the previous one as a typical situation .",
    "based on this assumption we suggested a method of evaluation of the basic critical exponents of 2d asm .",
    "our latest simulations , however , have shown that the next wave typically overlaps the previous one .",
    "moreover , the large - scale simulations of paczuski and boettcher @xcite state that the average difference of sizes between two subsequent waves is actually negative .    nevertheless , we will show in this paper that it is possible to modify our simplified scenario of the avalanche process and to describe the phases of expansion and contraction in terms of the wave decomposition .",
    "besides , we will demonstrate that the theoretical predictions are in complete agreement with the numerical data obtained by paczuski and boettcher @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the asm model , define avalanche clusters and waves of topplings and introduce the basic ideas of expansion and contraction of avalanches .",
    "section iii is devoted to the description of the local dynamics of waves and proof of the existence of the contraction exponent . in section",
    "iv we present analytical derivation of the exponents of conditional distribution of waves obtained by paczuski and boettcher @xcite from extensive numerical simulations . in section",
    "v , an elucidative point of view on the renormalization group approach @xcite to the sandpile model is suggested .",
    "we remind the definitions of the model , waves of topplings , avalanche clusters and explain our basic ideas .    in 2d",
    "asm one starts from the empty square lattice ( occupation numbers @xmath1 for all sites ) and drops sand , particle by particle , at random sites : @xmath2 . if any @xmath3 , the site @xmath4 is unstable and topples : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the laplacian matrix .",
    "the toppling at @xmath4 may cause instability at its nearest neighbors .",
    "the subsequent topplings continue until there are no more unstable sites",
    ". then , one adds again a particle at random site initiating a new chain of topplings and so on .",
    "the process of toppling during each perturbation is called an avalanche and the set of toppled sites form a compact cluster of all toppled sites .    to obtain the wave decomposition of an avalanche @xcite , one has to topple all sites that become unstable after adding a particle at @xmath4 keeping this site out of the second toppling .",
    "the set @xmath7 of toppled sites is the first wave of topplings .",
    "all sites except maybe the site @xmath4 become stable after the first wave .",
    "if the resulting height @xmath3 , one topples the site @xmath4 the second time and continues the relaxation process not permitting this site to topple the third time .",
    "the new set @xmath8 of relaxed sites is the second wave .",
    "the process continues until the site @xmath4 becomes stable and the avalanche stops .",
    "grassberger and manna @xcite defined clusters @xmath9 of sites toppled not less than @xmath10 times during the given avalanche , @xmath11 is the number of topplings at the initially perturbed site .",
    "the sets @xmath12 are all compact and each @xmath13 contains the clusters @xmath14 .",
    "it is possible to evaluate the asymptotics of cluster size distribution considering the set of generated clusters without reference to a particular avalanche they belong to . according to @xcite",
    ", the expected number of topplings at site @xmath15 due to adding a particle at site @xmath4 is given by the lattice green function @xmath16_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the number of topplings @xmath17 coincides with the expected number of clusters @xmath13 containing the site @xmath15 in an avalanche started at @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the probability that the linear extent @xmath18 of a cluster exceeds the distance @xmath19 between @xmath4 and @xmath15 is @xmath20 using the known asymptotics of the green function for large distances @xmath21 and compactness of clusters ( cluster area @xmath22 ) , we get @xmath23    it was established in @xcite , that every wave is a compact set without holes and each site in a wave topples exactly once in that wave . thus , the expected number of topplings @xmath17 given by the lattice green function can be expressed alternatively by the probability that a wave taken from an arbitrary avalanche initiated at site @xmath4 covers site @xmath15 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) for waves , we get again the size distribution similar to eq.([2 ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the area of a wave .    to find critical exponents characterizing the size distribution of avalanches ,",
    "one also needs a general picture of the avalanche process as a whole . in the case of clusters ,",
    "the picture is quite clear .",
    "the set of clusters is ordered and each next cluster is embedded into the previous one .",
    "however , the clusters of topplings , being convenient for a computer decomposition of avalanches , are hardly reproducible by dynamical rules as each cluster grows monotonically during the whole avalanche process .    on the contrary",
    ", the wave construction admits a simple dynamical interpretation but loses the property of ordering which is inherent in the case of clusters . in spite of the irregularity of waves , we are still able to use a partial ordering of waves assuming that a typical avalanche consists of two phases : fast expansion and slow contraction .",
    "the first phase contains relatively few waves with a large negative difference between subsequent waves @xmath26 .",
    "the second phase forms the main body of an avalanche with a positive average difference @xmath27 . in @xcite",
    "the fast phase was associated with the single first wave which reaches at once a maximal size the given avalanche spreads . the positive difference for the rest of the waves",
    "was assumed to be dependent only on the size of a preceding wave and satisfied the scaling law @xmath28 for large @xmath29 .",

    "then , the critical exponent @xmath39 in the distribution of a number of sites covered by an avalanche @xmath40 can be related with the exponent @xmath41 in eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the probability distribution of cluster sizes @xmath42 is proportional to the probability of avalanches whose size @xmath38 exceeds @xmath34 : @xmath43 and to the density of clusters eq.([5 ] ) : @xmath44 comparing eq.([6 ] ) with eq.([2 ] ) we obtain @xmath45 and the problem of finding the basic exponent @xmath39 is reduced to search for the exponent @xmath41 which is related more directly to details of the avalanche process .    the contraction exponent @xmath41 is well defined for avalanche clusters or for waves provided that one can neglect the differences between these two kinds of objects . in this connection , the following questions arise .",
    "is it possible to define the contraction exponent for waves taking into account overlappings and if so , what is a correspondence between its numerical values for clusters and waves ?",
    "can we establish the same relation eq.([7 ] ) for waves and use their spanning tree structure to estimate the critical exponents of the model ?    in the following sections we discuss these questions using large scale simulations of clusters of topplings , a more elaborated analysis of waves and new numerical data for subsequent waves obtained by paczuski and boettcher @xcite .",

    "the graph @xmath47 is shifted vertically .",
    "first , we present a picture of a typical avalanche of 2d asm on a square lattice of size @xmath31 for @xmath32 . on fig.1",
    "we plot the size @xmath30 of the wave as a function of its number @xmath49 in the avalanche .",
    "we can see that many of the next waves have the size greater than the size of the previous one .",
    "moreover , even those waves , whose size is actually less than the size of its predecessor , are not most frequently embedded into the set of sites formed by the previous wave . for the particular avalanche presented on fig.1 the event of overlapping",
    "the previous wave by the next one occurs for all waves except the sixth and the last one .",
    "anyway , one can note that a typical avalanche contains several sharp peaks corresponding to fast expansion of the avalanche size and in - between intervals of relatively slow , although irregular , contraction .",
    "one may expect that the average difference between subsequent waves in the slow phase follows a scaling law similar to eq.([4 ] ) . to verify this",
    ", one has to extract from the averaging of @xmath50 those waves which are related to the expansion phase .",
    "we can avoid this cumbersome and ambiguous procedure introducing new variables characterizing the local contraction and expansion .",

    "concerning the estimation of the exponents @xmath41 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we have to point out that the numerical determination of these values is a rather difficult problem because of a slow convergence of data obtained for large lattices to their limiting values .",
    "so , our numerical results @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath32 are still far from the expected limit .",
    "the problem of estimation of these exponents is somehow similar to the numerical determination of the exponent @xmath39 ( for discussion , see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the extrapolation @xmath68 gives us some wide interval of possible values of @xmath41 and @xmath63 which includes 3/4 , the theoretical prediction @xcite for the exact value .",
    "being equivalent to @xmath39 from a computational point of view , the exponent @xmath63 is more convenient for theoretical evaluations .",
    "the spanning tree representation of waves @xcite makes it possible to interpret @xmath69 as a sum of branches attached to the boundary of a wave @xcite , and then to use exact results obtained for the one - component potts model @xcite .",

    "finally , we establish the relationship of the type of eq.(7 ) for the exponents @xmath39 and @xmath63 . following argumentation for clusters ( section ii ) , we estimate the known asymptotics of size distribution @xmath75 of waves eq.([3 ] ) which is proportional to the probability of avalanches whose size @xmath38 exceeds @xmath25 : @xmath76 and to the density of waves @xmath77 let @xmath78 be the number of waves in a particular avalanche with sizes between @xmath79 and @xmath29 provided that the size of the given avalanche is greater than @xmath29 . the asymptotic behavior of @xmath80 can be evaluated as @xmath81 for large @xmath82 .",

    "a serious problem , however , is how to select the waves relating to the slow phase . in a real avalanche",
