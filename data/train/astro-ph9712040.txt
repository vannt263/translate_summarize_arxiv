    "the good fits to all three types of spectral model is in contrast to the lecs spectrum of cal87 , which is better fit by both lte and nlte wd atmosphere models than a blackbody .",

    "the 68% confidence upper limit optical depth to an edge at an energy of 0.49  kev is 2.3 .",
    "this probably explains why smooth functions such as blackbodies provide good fits to the  spectrum .",
    "comparison of the two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] reveals that most of the additional contribution to @xmath67 for the nlte models is at energies @xmath40.4  kev where the blackbody provides a better fit .",
    "one possibility is that the model atmosphere data are less appropriate at the temperatures used for modeling  ( 3050  ev ) , rather than cal87 ( 5575  ev ) .",
    "some idea of the very different lecs count spectra for these two sources can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , although much of the difference is due to the @xmath210 times lower absorption to   compared to cal87 ( @xmath2@xmath68 and @xmath2@xmath69  , respectively ) .",
    "alternatively , we can not exclude the possibility of a hard component from  with a luminosity of @xmath70@xmath71  ( see sect .",
    "[ subsect : model_fits ] ) , which may affect the fits in the @xmath40.4  kev energy range .",
    "the wd mass can be constrained assuming that  is on the stability line for steady nuclear burning ( see iben 1982 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the best - fit nlte temperature , when  is constrained to be equal to the hst value , of @xmath1  ev corresponds to a wd of mass @xmath20.91.0@xmath3 with a luminosity of @xmath2@xmath72   ( see also iben & tutukov 1996 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the measured luminosity of @xmath73  .",
    "this good agreement is in contrast to cal87 where the luminosity derived from the stability line is at least a factor 8 higher than that observed ( parmar et al .",
    "this implies that in the case of , the line of sight to the emitting region is not significantly obscured by e.g. , an accretion disk .",
    "in addition , the emission region radius of @xmath74  cm is somewhat larger than the expected wd radius ( @xmath75  cm for a 0.9@xmath3 wd ; bergeron et al .",
    "1992 ) .    in 1996",
    "april  underwent a temporary x - ray off - state ( kahabka 1997 ) .",
    "this has been modeled by either the cessation of steady nuclear burning in the surface layers of a massive ( @xmath41.3@xmath3 ) wd ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) or by the expansion of the wd atmosphere following an episode of increased mass accretion rate on a massive ( @xmath91.2  @xmath3 ) wd ( kahabka 1997 ) .",
    "both these models support the view that the x - ray emission from   originates from steady nuclear burning in the surface layers of a wd and it is interesting to note that the wd mass derived above , assuming that the system is on the stability line of iben ( 1982 ) , is lower than both the above estimates .",
