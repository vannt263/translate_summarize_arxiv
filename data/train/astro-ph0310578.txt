    "while the existence of the galactic bar was pointed out decades ago @xcite , the bar existence received a broader support only following the work of @xcite , based on 2.4 micron light distribution in the inner galaxy as measured by @xcite , and the work of @xcite , based on the asymmetry in the distribution of galactic bulge stars as measured by iras .",
    "the presence of the galactic bar has been observed in many different ways ; recent reviews are provided by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) is a long term observing project carried out at the las campanas observatory in chile , operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the instrumentation of the three stages of the project was described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a catalogue of over 200,000 variable stars discovered within approximately 11 square degrees in the direction of the galactic bulge was published by @xcite .",
    "the public domain data set contains @xmath8 i - band photometric data points obtained in the observing seasons 1997 , 1998 , 1999 with the ogle - ii instrumentation : a dedicated 1.3-meter telescope with a @xmath9 pixel ccd camera , built and operated by the warsaw university observatory .",
    "the presence of the galactic bar was already detected in the apparent distribution of red clump giants in the ogle - i data ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we set out to determine whether the evidence for the galactic bar may also be found among ogle variables .",
    "we calculated periodograms ( @xcite , @xcite ) for each of the 200,000 objects in the ogle - ii variable star catalogue @xcite that had at least 100 i - band measurements , and accepted as real those for which the probability of a false signal @xcite was smaller than 0.001 . because fields 45 and 46 have only two seasons of observations ( fewer than 100 measurements ) , periodograms were not calculated for any stars in these fields .",
    "we were struck by the two clear sequences apparent in the period  amplitude diagram , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for many stars ,",
    "several significant periods were found .",
    "the plotted period has the largest amplitude .",
    "our convention is that amplitudes are defined as half of the peak - to - peak amplitude for a given mode .",
    "originally , we had intended to use mira - type long period variables as possible tracers of the galactic bar .",
    "however , it is clear that the variables defining the two sequences in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are more numerous and , having small amplitudes , they appear to be more useful than miras as tracers of the galactic structure . therefore , this paper is devoted to these low amplitude variables only .",
    "in addition to the two sequences present in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] there is a clump of variables around @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; this is mostly caused by an artefact , and should be ignored .",
    "we divided the variables into types a and b , with the division line shown in fig .",
    "type a is above and to the left , and type b below and to the right , of the division line .",
    "variables within the parallelograms : @xmath12 @xmath13 were selected in 33 ogle - ii fields spanning a large range of galactic longitudes , but only a small range of galactic latitudes .",
    "the colour  magnitude diagram , corrected for interstellar reddening and extinction with the maps provided by @xcite , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the field bul_sc1 .",
    "type a variables are marked with large blue dots ; b variables are marked with green open circles .",
    "a relatively small range of apparent i - band magnitudes and a large number of variables indicates that these stars might be useful ` standard candles , ' and that it might be possible to use them as tracers of the galactic bar .",
    "most variables shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are bright red giants .",
    "it is very likely that these stars are similar to the variables found by @xcite and @xcite in the ogle catalogue for the lmc and smc , to those found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the macho database for the lmc , to the m giant variables in ngc 6522 @xcite , and to those found by @xcite in the macho database for the galactic bulge .",
    "minimum variability levels have been detected for red giants from the eso project ",
    "long term photometry on variables \" ( @xcite ) , and also from hipparcos photometry ( @xcite ) , the cooler stars having larger minimum variability thresholds and larger mean amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , a period - amplitude relation has been noticed for a few red giants stars by @xcite , and also in a large sample of stars from asas data ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible theoretical mechanism for the oscillations was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the aim of our paper is to select from the ogle catalogue red giant variables populating the two period  amplitude sequences in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , to provide many parameters for these variables in electronically accessible tables , and to check if they trace the galactic bar .",
    "we used reddening maps published by @xcite for 48 ogle - ii galactic bulge fields .",
    "all variables of type a in a subset of these fields located at the galactic latitude @xmath14 are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that they form three distinct groups : luminous red giants , less luminous red giants located near the bulge red clump region , and relatively blue galactic disc stars .",
    "these three groups are well separated .",
    "we selected stars located above and to the right of the line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for our study , and we refer to them as ogle small amplitude red giant variables ( osargs ) .",
    "some type b variables are close to the saturation limit of ogle - ii , and therefore we restrict our study of the galactic structure to osarg type a variables only .",
    "the ogle saturation limit causes a problem for the study of the brightest osargs .",
    "this technical difficulty will be overturned when the asas i - band data @xcite become available , which have a limiting i - mag of about 14 , and a considerable overlap with ogle - ii photometry .",
    "three years of galactic bulge data have been acquired by asas already . for our analysis",
    "we omit fields located far from @xmath14 , and those fields for which a reliable extinction map is not available .",
    "this leaves us with a total of 33 ogle - ii fields .",
    "the osarg type a variables form a nearly horizontal sequence in the colour  magnitude diagram shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we fitted their distribution with a straight line using the least square method , and looking for the best global solution of the form : @xmath15 , \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the reddening corrected average magnitude and colour for variable number @xmath18 in the field @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a constant , different for every field , representing the ` average ' magnitude of osarg type a variables in field @xmath19 , @xmath21 is the same constant for all fields , and @xmath22 is the mean @xmath23 colour for all osarg type a variables in all 33 fields represented in fig .",
    "we computed the value of the parameter @xmath21 as 0.169 .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath24 and the standard deviations from the relation ( 2 ) are given in table  [ tab1 ] for all 33 fields .",
    "this table also lists the total number of type a and type b variables in each field and the galactic coordinates of the field centers .",
    "[ fig4 ] presents the variation of the average magnitude of osarg type a variables with the galactic longitude .",
    "a clear trend is present , practically identical to that shown by the red clump giants ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , demonstrating that osarg variables are located in the galactic bar .",
    "we repeated the analysis for osarg type b variables and it was qualitatively similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , but disturbed by the ogle - ii saturation limit .",
    "multiple periods were detected for most osargs .",
    "the ratios of those periods to the dominant period ( i.e. , the one with the largest amplitude ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as a function of the dominant period .",
    "several bands corresponding to the period ratios close to 2 , 1.4 , 0.9 , 0.75 , and 0.5 are clearly seen .",
    "the interpretation of this rich spectrum of oscillations is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "our intent is to present this richness with a hope that it may attract specialists to investigate the nature of the oscillations .",
    "virtually all osargs were identified with objects in the 2mass catalogue , and the values of j , h , and k magnitude are included in the tables available on internet / simbad .",
    "a sample of these tables is shown in our table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "these magnitudes were corrected for interstellar extinction using maps developed by @xcite and using extinction ratios between the infrared bands and v - band provided by @xcite .",
    "note that the extinction in k - band is small , and any errors in the estimate are of relatively little consequence .",
    "the average k - band magnitude , corrected for extinction , varies with galactic longitude in a way similar to that seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    next , extinction corrected @xmath25 magnitudes were also corrected for the galactic bar effect ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] of this paper ) to the distance corresponding to galactic longitude @xmath26 ; we label the corresponding magnitudes @xmath27 .",
    "a relation between the dominant period of oscillations and @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "the two groups of osargs that are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are also clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "the two groups of osargs are also plotted in the infrared color  magnitude diagram in fig .",
    "only 20% of all variables are plotted to avoid crowding .",
    "there is almost full overlap between the two groups , distinctly different from the clear separation in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the dependence of the dominant period on the reddening corrected @xmath23 color , and clear period  color relations are apparent .",
    "note : k - band magnitude is close to the bolometric magnitude , and hence the period  luminosity relations are clearly visible in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "however , the bright giants form a nearly horizontal line in the @xmath28 diagram shown in fig .",
    "hence , the @xmath23 color is for them a better absolute luminosity indicator than the @xmath29 magnitude , and this is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .    finally , it is time for us to present a random sample of type a and type b osargs in fig .",
    "these are 12 variables of each type in the field @xmath30 , sorted with increasing dominant period .",
    "these appear as semi - regular variables because of their rich period structure .",
    "a much longer time baseline of photometric measurements will become available soon when the current ogle - iii data are processed and published ( cf .",
    "udalski et al .",
    "2002a ) . with a longer time baseline",
    ", it will be much easier to decide to what extent the multiple periods we found are stable , and to what extent osargs are multiply - periodic rather than semi - regular variables .",
    "we provide a catalogue of 8970 osarg type a variables and 6399 osarg type b variables in electronic form at :    http://www.astro.princeton.edu/@xmath31jwray/osarg/    in the files a.txt and b.txt , respectively .",
    "separate files for each field are available at the same url , and are called a1.txt , a2.txt ,  , a49.txt and b1.txt , b2.txt ,  , b49.txt .",
    "the catalogue is a subset of the general ogle - ii catalogue of variable stars in the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "a sample of the tables , listing data for the first 25 type a stars from the field @xmath32 , is shown in table  [ tab2 ] , which is split into two parts because of its considerable width .",
    "the consecutive columns are as follows : the variable star number according to @xcite ; the star number according to ogle maps ( @xcite ) ; 2000 ra and dec ; x and y pixel coordinates ; average v - band magnitude ; v - band extinction ; average ( v - i ) color ; ( v - i ) reddening ; average i - band magnitude ; i - band extinction ; j , h , k - band magnitudes ; the dominant period and its amplitude ; the next three significant periods and amplitudes . in cases where fewer than three significant periods were found ,",
    "the extra columns contain the value -99.99999 .",
    "similarly , for a few stars there was no match found in the 2mass catalogue , so the j , h , k columns for those stars contain the value -9.999 .",
    "the coordinates and i and v - band magnitudes are given following ogle maps ( @xcite ) , the reddening and extinction is given following @xcite , and the j , h , k magnitudes are given following 2mass ( all - sky point source catalogue , release 2003 march 25 ) .",
    "we provide all these data in electronically accessible files to facilitate analysis of osarg variables to all interested users .",
    "there can be no doubt that osargs have been found in the macho database for the galactic bulge @xcite , and that they are related to red giant variables found in the lmc and smc by @xcite , by @xcite and by @xcite . however , there is also a striking difference between the galactic bulge and the lmc and smc : the multiple narrow bands seen in the @xmath33 diagrams for the lmc and smc are not present in the galactic bulge , where we see only two groups of stars .",
    "it appears that our type a and b variables correspond to type @xmath34 and @xmath35 variables , respectively , of ita et al .",
    "( 2003 , fig .",
    "note : the distance modulus to the galactic bulge is 4 mag smaller than that to the lmc , so the red giant tip , which is at @xmath36 in the lmc , is expected to be at @xmath37 in the galactic bulge .",
    "unfortunately , this is close to the i - band saturation limit of ogle , and this complicates the comparison and biases our diagrams .",
    "we have an impression that our two sequences of variables are broader in the apparent magnitude than the corresponding sequences seen in the lmc and smc .",
    "this may be caused by at least two effects : the galactic bar has a relatively large radial depth , which remains an effect even after correction is made for the inclination ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and there is likely also a broad range of metallicities in our galaxy as compared to lmc and smc .",
    "another striking difference between osargs and similar variables in the lmc is the presence of a large number of lmc stars with color @xmath38 , as shown in fig .  3 of @xcite ; these are carbon stars .",
    "we found very few such variables , as is apparent in our fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where there are less than a handful of stars off the right hand limit of the figure .",
    "this difference may be due to the higher metallicity of the galactic bulge as compared with the lmc .",
    "the period  amplitude relations as presented in our fig .  [ fig1 ] have not been reported in print to the best of our knowledge .",
    "however , similar relations were found for the lmc and smc variables by @xcite .",
    "we restrict this paper to the announcement of the osarg variables in the galactic bulge / bar , to the catalogue of 15,369 objects , and to the demonstration that they are located in a bar inclined to the line of sight .",
    "we make no attempt at modelling the bar , as considerably more complete data should be available as soon as asas photometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) becomes available , and the problems with the ogle saturation limit are alleviated .",
