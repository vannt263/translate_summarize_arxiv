    "our galactic center ( gc ) , at a distance of @xmath9  kpc @xcite , is the closest galactic nucleus , observable at spatial resolutions unapproachable in other galaxies ( 1 pc @xmath10 26@xmath11 ) .",
    "the extent of the gc region is defined by a region of relatively high density molecular gas ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , covering the inner @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , called the central molecular zone ( cmz ) .",
    "the cmz produces 5%10% of the galaxy s infrared and lyman continuum luminosity and contains 10% of its molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the cmz exhibits extreme conditions with high gas temperature , pressure , turbulence , strong magnetic field strengths and strong tidal shear @xcite . as a result ,",
    "star formation in the cmz may be altered or suppressed .",
    "the cmz , nevertheless , shows several signposts of recent massive star formation , such as ( compact ) h ii regions and supernova remnants .",
    "in addition , there are massive young stars ( ages of @xmath162 - 7 myrs ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) in three known discrete star clusters  the central , quintuplet , and arches clusters  which make the cmz distinctly different from the galactic bulge with its predominantly old stellar population @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been unclear how star formation proceeds in this hostile environment .",
    "there have been several studies in the literature that identified young stellar object ( yso ) candidates in the gc based on infrared photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high and patchy extinction towards the gc ( @xmath17 ) and its mix of young and old stellar populations , however , mean that spectroscopic observations are required to confirm yso identifications .",
    "this is because red giants and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( also part of the gc stellar population ) can look like ysos from broad - band photometry , if they are heavily dust attenuated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the gc provides a unique opportunity to investigate circumnuclear star formation with an unprecedented spatial resolution .",
    "we announced the first spectroscopic identification of massive ysos in the cmz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a09 ) , using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we follow up our initial exploration of the irs data set in a09 and refine our methods to identify ysos in the cmz , aiming at providing a list of spectroscopically confirmed ysos as tracers of the early stages of star formation in the gc . as described and employed in a09 , our selection criteria for ysos are based on gas- and solid - phase absorption from mid - ir spectroscopy .",
    "this includes solid - phase absorption from the co@xmath5 bending mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gas - phase absorption from c@xmath5h@xmath5 , hcn , and co@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we look for signatures of co@xmath5 ice mixed with a large amount of ch@xmath6oh ice .",
    "this combination has been observed towards high - mass ysos and low - mass ysos @xcite , but not toward field stars behind molecular clouds @xcite .    in ",
    "[ sec : method ] we summarize the irs target selection criteria and data reduction . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we describe our spectroscopic identification of ysos , showing that 15%30% of our 107 targets are massive ysos .",
    "we measure the extinction for ysos and possible ysos , along with column densities of solid - phase and gas - phase molecular absorbers . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we examine properties of these ysos and possible ysos , and derive a preliminary estimate of the star formation rate in the gc .",
    "in this section we describe procedures for the sample selection , spectroscopic follow - up observations , and irs data reduction .",
    "parallel information on these subjects can be found in a09 , but here we repeat this for the reader s convenience with additional details where there has been improvements in the data reduction steps .",
    "our 107 spectroscopic targets ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) were selected from the gc point source catalog @xcite extracted from the irac images of the cmz @xcite made using the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard the _",
    "spitzer space telescope_. these images cover @xmath18  pc @xmath19 @xmath20  pc in the four irac channels ( @xmath21 m , @xmath22 m , @xmath23 m , and @xmath24 m ) with uniform high sensitivity .",
    "compared to earlier imaging surveys of this region , such as that from the _ midcourse space experiment _",
    "( _ msx _ ; * ? ? ? * ) or isogal @xcite , the irac images have a higher spatial resolution ( @xmath25 vs.  @xmath26 of earlier surveys ) , which has led not only to a better estimate of source fluxes , but also to more accurate source positions for follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "the spectroscopic sample was selected using irac color criteria based on the @xcite study of the giant region rcw  49 .",
    "@xcite determined the locations of ysos with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 on the irac color - magnitude diagrams , using radiative transfer models described in @xcite . from this we chose an initial color criterion ( @xmath30 - [ 8.0 ] } \\geq 2.0 $ ] ;",
    "we added a latitudinal constraint ( @xmath31 ) to increase the probability that the objects are located at the distance of the gc ( @xmath32  kpc ; * ? ? ? * ) rather than in one of the several intervening spiral arms along the line of sight .",
    "we note that the range of this latitude selection is about 5 times larger than the scale height of photometric yso candidates ( @xmath33  pc ) in @xcite .",
    "these color and position constraints provided an initial sample of 1207 objects from the gc point source catalog .",
    "we combined the irac photometry with two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) photometry ( @xmath34 ; * ? ? ? * ) and isogal @xmath35 m and @xmath4 m point - source catalogs .",
    "note that @xmath36 m multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) observations at the gc were not available at the time when our irs sample was chosen . among the initially selected 1207 objects , 336 had photometry in at least 5 bandpasses , which allowed reliable spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting .",
    "we used the sed fitting tool developed by @xcite , which makes use of a grid of 200,000 yso models @xcite to estimate yso parameters , such as the mass of a central object ( see   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "for those objects with photometry in fewer than five bandpasses , we instead applied color constraints based on the work of @xcite of @xmath30-[4.5 ] } \\geq 0.5 $ ] , @xmath37-[5.8 ] } \\geq 0.5 $ ] , and @xmath38-[8.0 ] } \\geq 1.0 $ ] .",
    "the sed fitting and additional irac color constraints narrowed our sample down to about 200 objects , which were then further inspected using irac three - color images .",
    "the sources were evaluated by their distinctiveness ( i.e. , whether sources are easily distinguishable from the background ) and their local background emission . among 200 objects examined ,",
    "112 were found to exhibit the necessary distinctiveness within the irs slit widths .",
    "a literature search was performed on the 112 objects , yielding matches to 43 previously studied sources : 25 sources were previously - identified photometric yso candidates , 4 were oh / ir stars , one was a wolf - rayet star , and the remaining 13 sources were others ( e.g. , radio sources , x - ray sources , etc ) .",
    "note that nearly 60% ( @xmath39 ) of the objects had been selected as yso candidates by other methods .",
    "the 4 oh / ir stars and the wolf - rayet star were discarded from the final sample , giving a total of 107 massive yso candidates .",
    "the spatial location of the 107 massive yso candidates of our sample is shown in figure  [ fig : map ] .    in spite of our efforts to exclude oh / ir stars from our yso sample",
    ", we later realized that several of our targets appear to be coincident with a stellar maser source and/or a long - period variable ( sstgc  284291 , 425399 , 564417 , 619964 , 660708 , 696367 , and 711462 ) .",
    "sstgc  517724 is now identified as an ob supergiant by @xcite .",
    "these sources known not to be ysos have been helpful in refining our spectroscopic yso selection criteria .",
    "massive ysos are our primary targets for the follow - up spectroscopic observations (   [ sec : obs ] ) because our adopted color selection criteria set the lower limit on the mass of the central object to be @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the source confusion limit in the input gc point source catalog ( see figure  12 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , together with the 8  kpc distance to the gc @xcite and @xmath41  mag of visual extinction , limits us to detecting ysos with masses @xmath42 ( see   [ sec : analysis ] ) .",
    "thus any yso we identify in this paper is a _ massive _ yso .",
    "our irs observations with a total integration time of @xmath43 hours were carried out in may and october 2008 ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) as part of _ spitzer _ cycle  4 ( program i d : 40230 , pi : s.  ramrez ) .",
    "we observed our 107 targets with both high- and low - resolution irs modules : short - high ( sh ; @xmath44m@xmath45 m , @xmath46 ) , long - high ( lh ; @xmath47m@xmath48 m , @xmath46 ) , short - low ( sl ; @xmath49m@xmath50 m , @xmath51 ) , and long - low ( ll ; @xmath52m@xmath53 m , @xmath54 ) .    in table  [ tab : tab2 ] we list irs modules used in the current analysis for each of the sources that are spectroscopically identified as a yso or possible yso in this paper ( see   [ sec : yso ] ) .",
    "most of these targets were observed with all of the four irs modules .",
    "we did not obtain spectra with the sl module for some of the 107 yso candidates , including possible yso sstgc  610642 , because of saturation in the irs peak - up arrays ( see below ) .",
    "for a few sources we rejected data in the first order of ll ( ll1 ; @xmath55 m - @xmath56 m ) because a large fraction of pixel values were flagged as invalid .",
    "we divided our sample into four subsamples according to their irac [ 8.0 ] magnitudes : [ 8.0 ] @xmath57  mag ( @xmath58 objects ) , @xmath59  mag @xmath60 [ 8.0 ] @xmath61  mag ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath63  mag @xmath64 [ 8.0 ] @xmath65  mag ( @xmath62 ) , and [ 8.0 ] @xmath66  mag ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "exposure times were determined for each brightness subsample to achieve a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of at least @xmath68 in sh and sl , and a minimum s / n of @xmath69 in lh and ll .",
    "our exposure times are @xmath59  sec@xmath70  sec in sh , @xmath59  sec@xmath71  sec in lh , @xmath59  sec@xmath72  sec in sl , and @xmath59  sec in ll modules .",
    "subsamples were further grouped based on spatial location .",
    "these groupings allowed us to observe 107 sources using nine `` fixed cluster '' target observations , a strategy which proved to greatly increase the observing efficiency by reducing overheads due to telescope movement .",
    "each object was observed in the irs staring mode with 4 exposures per source ( 2 cycles ) to properly correct for bad pixels .",
    "our observations were carried out without specific irs peak - up sequences , since target coordinates were accurate enough ( @xmath73 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for our science goals .",
    "in addition , the background at the gc is too high for a peak - up sequence to work even using a 2mass source .",
    "in fact , the background at the gc is so high that constraints were placed on the observing dates ( which determine the telescope roll angle ) to avoid saturation of the irs peak - up arrays .",
    "such saturation leads to incorrect droop corrections in the standard irs pipelines and causes various defects on sl frames ( where the peak - up arrays are located ) .",
    "the sl observations were not carried out for 21 out of 107 targets because of saturation in the peak - up arrays regardless of the date of observation .",
    "multiple off - source measurements at several different locations were carried out to derive background spectra around each target , because strong and spatially variable background at the gc can affect resulting line and/or continuum emission from the source .",
    "since the high - resolution slits are not long enough to take both source and background measurements simultaneously , we located four background positions around each target ( @xmath741  offsets in right ascension , @xmath741   offsets in declination ) .",
    "specific background positions for both sh and lh were determined to avoid background sources and to properly interpolate background emission near the source position over a @xmath75 scale .",
    "the longer slit sizes of the low - resolution modules permit background measurements along the on - source slit ; we also identified two additional background positions that are @xmath74 1  away in the direction perpendicular to the sl or ll slit .",
    "these dedicated background slits for sl and ll were centered on two of the high - resolution background positions .",
    "figure  [ fig : slits ] displays the irs slit positions for on - source ( _ left _ ) and off - source ( _ right _ ) measurements for one of our sources ( sstgc  797384 ) .",
    "source and background spectra were taken consecutively to minimize zodiacal light and instrumental variations .",
    "each order of sl or ll was used to observe a target , and different orders cover different parts of the sky near each target .",
    "the low ecliptic latitude of the gc restricts the ll slits to a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath76  and the sl slits to a pa of @xmath77  or 180 .",
    "we began reducing the high - resolution irs spectra from the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) , while we started with coadded products ( post - bcd ) for the low - resolution spectra .",
    "we used the s18.7 version of the irs pipeline for both . on the lh frames we applied the darksettle software package to correct for non - uniform dark currents .",
    "we corrected for rogue pixel values using the ssc software package irsclean@xmath78 .",
    "we only applied campaign rogue masks ( campaigns 50 and 55 for the spring and autumn runs , respectively ) , except in sl , where we applied our own edited version to mask out hot pixels at @xmath79 m in addition to campaign rogue pixels .",
    "we then used spice@xmath78 to extract target and background spectra , and further corrected high - resolution spectra ( sh , lh ) for fringe patterns using the irsfringe@xmath78 package .    four background spectra per target were extracted for the high - resolution ( sh and lh ) observations as four off - source pointings were obtained per target . for the low - resolution ( sl and ll ) observations ,",
    "two background spectra were extracted from observations at the same positions as the high - resolution background observations and two background spectra were extracted along the on - source slit observations . for some objects ,",
    "the high - resolution background slits were not coincident with the on - source low - resolution slits .",
    "for these , we inspected the slit positions on an irac / mips composite image to determine the extraction position along the on - source sl or ll slit that was closest in flux and position to the high - resolution background slits .    for each module and for each target , we were able to extract four background spectra , that we used to estimate the target background by making a linear interpolation of the background flux at the source position at each wavelength .",
    "our interpolation scheme estimates the background flux gradient over a @xmath75 angular scale , since each background pointing is @xmath75 away from the science target .",
    "if the background emission is varying over a smaller angular scale , then background subtraction would be more uncertain .",
    "we found that spectra extracted from various irs modules usually do not match with each other at overlapping wavelengths , primarily due to the different sizes of the slit entrances .",
    "the sl and ll modules have @xmath80 and @xmath81 slit widths , respectively , while the slit entrances of sh and lh modules are @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively",
    ". therefore , contamination by point sources and/or extended emission at the gc can easily lead to a flux mismatch among the various irs modules .    to obtain internally consistent fluxes from all of the irs modules , we scaled the spectra to match the fluxes from the second order of ll ( ll2 ; @xmath52 m - @xmath84 m ) . on the longer wavelength side , we scaled the ll1 spectrum to the ll2 spectrum by estimating a median flux ratio for the two modules in the overlapping wavelength region .",
    "we masked known emission features and rejected points that were more than @xmath85 away from the median flux ratio .",
    "on the shorter wavelength side , the scaling was done in a step - by - step fashion .",
    "we first scaled the sh spectrum to the base flux of the ll2 spectrum ( before correcting for order tilts ; see below ) .",
    "we then matched the spectrum in the first order of sl ( sl1 ; @xmath86 m - @xmath87 m ) to the sh spectrum , then scaled the flux in sl3 ( bonus order ; @xmath88m@xmath89 m ) to the sl1 spectrum , and finally scaled the flux in the second order of sl ( sl2 ; @xmath49 m - @xmath90 m ) to sl3 .",
    "we can describe this concisely as ll2 @xmath91 ll1 , and ll2 @xmath91 sh @xmath91 sl1 @xmath91 sl3 @xmath91 sl2 .",
    "if a source was not clearly separated from extended background emission in ll2 , we opted to choose the sl1 spectrum as the base flux for scaling . in this case , the flux calibration was done in the following sequences : sl1 @xmath91 sh @xmath91",
    "ll2 @xmath91 ll1 , and sl1 @xmath91 sl3 @xmath91 sl2 .    scaling factors applied to each module are shown in table  [ tab : tab2 ] . the second column in table  [ tab : tab2 ] shows which module was used as the baseline for the flux calibration for each target",
    ". either large or small scaling factors are found in ll for sstgc  360559 , sl for sstgc  773985 , and ll for sstgc  801865 .",
    "these objects are faint ( [ 8.0]@xmath92  mag and @xmath93  mag for sstgc  360559 and 801865 , respectively , while sstgc  773985 was not detected in this bandpass ) on top of bright or saturated background emission on mips [ 24 ] images . as a result ,",
    "their mid - ir fluxes are heavily contaminated by background emissions at @xmath94 m , leading to an over - estimation of flux from the target slit .",
    "order - tilt features remained in about 30 high - resolution spectra , after applying irsfringe to sh and lh and darksettle to lh . to remove this artifact",
    ", we applied a @xmath95 order polynomial to each high - resolution spectral order to force it to match the re - scaled low - resolution spectra .",
    "in addition , three sources showed scalloping features in their high - resolution spectra ; a @xmath96 order polynomial was applied to correct for this artifact .",
    "individual spectra from various orders were then merged together using a linear ramp .",
    "some data were excluded from the analysis due to problems in a particular spectrum , such as saturation , excess bad pixels , or a poor match in background level .",
    "the last column in table  [ tab : tab2 ] lists any excluded data . each target",
    "was observed at two different nod positions in each module ; any nod positions that were excluded for a particular module are also given in the last column of table  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "a cardinal point ( nsew ) given in parentheses in this column indicates that the background spectrum offset in that direction from the source was not included in the background determination for that module .",
    "figures  [ fig : allspec][fig : allspec5 ] display spectra resulting from the above procedures ; orange lines are low - resolution spectra , and green lines represent high - resolution spectra . only sources we spectroscopically identify as a yso or possible yso",
    "are shown in figures  [ fig : allspec][fig : allspec4 ] .",
    "spectra of known oh / ir , long - period variable , or ob supergiant stars in our sample are shown in figure [ fig : allspec5 ] for comparison .",
    "there are several sources of flux uncertainty in our spectra : statistical , calibration ( difference between different nods ) , and the varying background ( this last is usually largest ) .",
    "this can cause spectral features observed in emission in the background appear in absorption in some spectra , such as the 11.3 @xmath3 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature ( e.g. sstgc 304239 ) , h@xmath5 emission at 17.0 @xmath3 m ( e.g. sstgc 761771 ) , or forbidden lines such as 12.8 @xmath3 m [ ne ii ] or 18.7 @xmath3 m [ s iii ] ( e.g. sstgc 670953 ) .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainty due to background subtraction by comparing results derived by excluding one of the four background pointings from the interpolated background spectrum . throughout our analysis",
    ", we have added these uncertainties in quadrature to derive final uncertainties in measured quantities such as the co@xmath5 ice column density .",
    "to study the @xmath4 m co@xmath5 ice absorption profile , we fitted five laboratory spectral components to the feature in all our 107 targets , following the same procedure described in a09 .",
    "figures  [ fig : co2][fig : co2.3 ] show the co@xmath5 ice decomposition for our ysos , possible ysos , and known stars for comparison , respectively .",
    "we describe below how we selected ysos and possible ysos based on this procedure .",
    "first , we set a local continuum over @xmath97 m @xmath98 m using a @xmath99 order polynomial to derive the optical depth .",
    "then we used the modeling technique and laboratory data in @xcite to decompose the absorption profile with five laboratory spectral components ; these are polar co@xmath5 ( co@xmath5:h@xmath5o @xmath100 at 10  k ; dotted line , centered at @xmath101 m ) , apolar co@xmath5 ( co : co@xmath102 at 10  k ; dotted line , centered at @xmath103 m ) , pure co@xmath5 ( 15  k ; blue shaded ) , diluted co@xmath5 ( co : co@xmath104 at 10  k ; black solid line ) , and @xmath105 m shoulder co@xmath5 ( modeled with two gaussians in wavenumber space ; orange shaded ) .",
    "we found a best - fitting set of models from the non - linear least squares fitting routine mpfit @xcite .",
    "fitting results are shown in table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "the co@xmath5 ice column densities were estimated from the integrated absorption , adopting the integrated line strength @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "background uncertainties were estimated by creating spectra with one of four background positions excluded from the interpolated background spectrum (  [ sec : method ] ) and then comparing the column densities derived from these spectra .",
    "we added these uncertainties in quadrature to the uncertainties from comparing column densities from spectra at the two nod positions , and to uncertainties in column densities due to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath107 and @xmath108 in table  [ tab : tab3 ] represent the total chi - square of the fit and the number of data points used in this fit .",
    "the goodness of fit is generally poor , implying either underestimated flux errors or our lack of knowledge of individual co@xmath5 ice models .",
    "nevertheless , the ice decomposition still provides useful information on the nature of ysos , as shown below . for comparison ,",
    "fitting results for some known stellar sources are included in table  [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "our primary method of identifying ysos from our irs observations is the co@xmath5 ice absorption profile at @xmath4 m , which is observed to have a different spectral shape in and around ysos @xcite .",
    "high - spectral resolution observations of many massive ysos in our galaxy @xcite and in the large magellanic cloud @xcite found a `` shoulder '' at 15.4 @xmath3 m on the co@xmath5 ice absorption profile .",
    "this @xmath105 m shoulder is thought to be due to the presence of ch@xmath6oh - rich co@xmath5 ice grains @xcite .",
    "detailed fitting of the 15 @xmath3 m co@xmath5 ice profile shows that the 15.4 @xmath3 m shoulder is weaker in low - mass protostars @xcite and is not detected towards field stars behind several molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "analysis of the 15 @xmath3 m co@xmath5 ice profile along the lines of sight to the central cluster and to two dusty wc9 stars in the quintuplet cluster demonstrates that none of these three gc spectra shows a 15.4 @xmath3 m shoulder on the 15 @xmath3 m co@xmath5 ice absorption profile @xcite .",
    "thus , the presence or absence of the 15.4 @xmath3 m shoulder is an empirical  and quantitative  way in the gc of distinguishing ysos from agb stars behind molecular clouds .",
    "the 15 @xmath3 m co@xmath5 ice absorption profiles displayed in figures  [ fig : co2][fig : co2.2 ] for 35 of our ysos or possible ysos ( see below ) show two absorption peaks , at 15.15 @xmath3 m and 15.4 @xmath3 m .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "double - peaked absorption at 15.10 @xmath3 m and 15.25 @xmath3 m is ascribed to pure co@xmath5 ices resulting from the crystallization of heated h@xmath5o - rich ices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we selected ysos by requiring that the model fit to the observed 15 @xmath3 m co@xmath5 ice profile significantly improves when the 15.4 @xmath3 m shoulder is included in the model .",
    "we calculated the reduced @xmath111 for fitting a four - component model ( excluding the 15.4 @xmath3 m shoulder ) to the 15 @xmath3 m co@xmath5 profile , as shown in the bottom panels in figures  [ fig : co2][fig : co2.2 ] .",
    "we then calculated the reduced @xmath111 for fitting the five - component model ( including the 15.4 @xmath3 m shoulder ) .",
    "finally , we calculated @xmath112 , equal to the reduced @xmath111 for the four component model minus the reduced @xmath111 for the five component model .",
