    "for the last few years , different exeperimental groups have been accumulating plenty of data for the charmless hadronic b decay modes . the cleo @xcite , the belle @xcite and the babar collaboration @xcite are providing us with the information on the branching ratio ( br ) and the cp asymmetry for different decay modes .",
    "a clear picture is about to emerge from these information .    among the @xmath6 ( @xmath10 denotes a pseudoscalar meson ) decay modes , the branching ratio for the decay @xmath11 is found to be still larger than that expected within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the sm contribution is about @xmath12 smaller than the experimental world average ( see fig.1 ) . among the @xmath7 ( @xmath13 denotes a vector meson ) decay modes , the experimentally observed br for the decay",
    "@xmath14 has been aloso found to be @xmath15 larger than the sm .",
    "the decay @xmath16 has been observed recently , and the br for the newly observed decay @xmath17 is also now available .    in this paper , we address these large br problems of @xmath18 systems using @xmath1-parity violating ( @xmath2 ) supersymmetric theories ( susy ) .",
    "the effects of @xmath2 couplings on @xmath0 decays have been investigated previously in the literatures @xcite , where attempts were made to fit just the large br for @xmath11@xcite . at present , we have many more available results .",
    "some of these results are concerned with decay modes involving @xmath19 and these modes are influenced by the same @xmath2 coupling that affects @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the decay modes @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath20 are affected by the new couplings which cure the large br problem of @xmath11 .",
    "hence , it is natural to investigate these newly observed decay modes and try to see whether all the available data can be explained simultaneously .",
    "we also need to be concerned about the other observed ( not involving @xmath4 ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay modes , which could be influenced by these new couplings .",
    "our effort is not to affect the other modes as much as possible , since except for @xmath21 decay modes , the other observed modes fit the available data well@xcite within the sm .",
    "further , using the preferred values of different parameters ( e.g. , new couplings etc . ) , we also make predictions for cp asymmetrey for these observed modes which will be verified in the near future .",
    "we organize this letter as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a very brief introduction to the sm and @xmath2 hamiltonian , and list the possible @xmath2 operators that can contribute to charmless @xmath0 decays .",
    "we discuss the @xmath6 and @xmath22 decay modes in section iii .",
    "the new physics contributions to different decay modes are also discussed . in section iv",
    ", we show how @xmath2 can explain the branching ratio of @xmath21 decay modes without jeopardizing many other @xmath6 and @xmath7 decay modes .",
    "we also discuss the cp asymmetry of these decay modes .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "the effective hamiltonian for charmless nonleptonic @xmath0 decays can be written as = g_f+ h.c .",
    "the wilson coefficients ( wcs ) , @xmath23 , contain the short - distance qcd corrections .",
    "we find all our expressions in terms of the effective wcs and refer the reader to the papers @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we use the effective wcs for the processes @xmath24 and @xmath25 from ref .",
    "the regularization scale is taken to be @xmath26 . in our discussion",
    ", we will neglect small effects of the electromagnetic moment operator @xmath27 , but will take into account effects from the four - fermion operators @xmath28 as well as the chromomagnetic operator @xmath29 .    the @xmath2 part of the superpotential of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can contain terms of the form _ = _",

    "the bilinear terms can be rotated away with redefinition of lepton and higgs superfields , but the effect reappears as @xmath40s , @xmath41s and lepton - number violating soft terms @xcite .",
    "the first three terms of eq.([superpot ] ) violate the lepton number , whereas the fourth term violates the baryon number .",
    "we do not want all these terms to be present simultaneously due to catastrophic rates for proton decay . in order to prevent proton decay",
    ", one set needs to be forbidden .    for our purpose , we will assume only @xmath42type couplings to be present",

    "an important role will be played by the @xmath48 -type couplings , the constraints on which are relatively weak .",
