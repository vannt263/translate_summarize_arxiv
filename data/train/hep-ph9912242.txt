    "( [ trigno - exercise ] ) determines @xmath0 up to an eight - fold ambiguity @xcite .",
    "a two - fold ambiguity arises from the fact that we know the signs of the cosines of @xmath169 and @xmath170 , but not the signs of the corresponding sine functions .",

    "large values of @xmath49 are expected in the sm . by contrast , resolving the @xmath175 ambiguity in the gw method , requires that @xmath48 vary significantly from one @xmath58 decay mode to the other .",
    "this is unlikely , because the experimental limits on cp - conserving phases in @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181  @xcite suggest that the @xmath48 are small .",
    "the @xmath182 and @xmath183 ambiguities are likely to degrade the value of the measurement of @xmath0 in a non - discrete manner .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for @xmath0 within the currently allowed region , eq .",
    "( [ smboundgamma ] ) , @xmath184 tends to be close enough to @xmath0 to make the two values indistinguishable within the experimental errors .",

    "in fact , that term is due to the interference cp violation present in the decay @xmath139 , and it is completely independent of the production mechanism of the neutral @xmath33 meson .",

    "we start by noting that @xmath323 have a standard cp - even ( cp - odd ) component given by @xmath325 ( @xmath326 ) , in addition to the mixing component @xmath318 ( @xmath319 ) .",

    "now , in the gw method @xmath3 only shows up in @xmath319 , _ c.f . _",
    "( [ osdeltasgw ] ) .",
    "therefore , the mixing contribution to the gw extraction of @xmath201 proportional to @xmath336 is also proportional to @xmath204 and , thus , it vanishes in the @xmath337 limit .",
    "we can also use this discussion to explain why @xmath201 is very similar to @xmath20 for @xmath338 , provided that @xmath203 is small .",

    "the presence of a potentially large @xmath251 has two consequences .",
    "firstly , the cp - odd quantity that exists even in the absence of mixing , is proportional to @xmath252 and can be large .",
    "therefore , the fact that the mixing cp - odd contribution to @xmath201 linear in @xmath319 always appears multiplied by @xmath252 ceases to constitute a suppression factor .",
    "secondly , there is now one @xmath3 contribution to @xmath318 which is proportional to @xmath253 .",
    "this will interfere with the standard cp - even contribution , @xmath342 , as is also unsuppressed in the @xmath337 limit . , but it is proportional to @xmath344 . ]",
    "we proceed to study the measurement of @xmath49 at a charm factory , operating at the @xmath345 resonance . for simplicity",
    ", we will discuss this measurement in the context of the sm .",

    "it is therefore best to perform all three measurements at the charm factory , canceling many systematic errors in the construction of the triangles of figure  [ fig:3770-triangle ] . to measure the amplitude @xmath353 ( @xmath354 ) , one of the @xmath345 daughters is tagged as a @xmath355 ( @xmath356 ) by observing it decay into a cp - odd ( cp - even ) state , such as @xmath357 ( @xmath358 ) .",
    "the other daughter is then @xmath356 ( @xmath355 ) , and the fraction of the time that it is seen decaying into @xmath350 gives the interference amplitude @xmath359 .",
    "we immediately find @xmath360 due to the low statistics tagging scheme of the @xmath361 measurement and the fact that @xmath362 , the error in @xmath363 is dominated by the @xmath361 measurement error .",
    "hence @xmath364 where @xmath365 is the number of events observed in the @xmath352 channels , and we made use of @xmath366 . since the event is fully reconstructed , background is expected to be small , and its contribution to @xmath367 is neglected in this discussion .",
    "@xmath365 is given by @xmath368 where @xmath369 is the number of @xmath370 events , @xmath371 are the cp - eigenstates used for tagging , and @xmath372 is the reconstruction efficiency of the state @xmath373 . taking  @xcite @xmath374 , @xmath375 and @xmath376 , and @xmath377 , eq .",

    "@xcite , resulting in @xmath381 .",
    "thus , @xmath363 can be measured to high precision , even in the presence of background and with relatively modest luminosity .",
    "we note that the same measurement technique can be used with multi - body @xmath14  decays , in which @xmath363 varies over the available phase space . while the relative statistical error in every small region of phase space will be large",
    ", its effect on the measurement of @xmath0 in @xmath382 will be proportionally small .",
    "the total error in @xmath0 due to @xmath383 will be as small as in the two  body @xmath350 mode , up to differences in @xmath14 branching fractions , reconstruction efficiencies , and backgrounds .",
