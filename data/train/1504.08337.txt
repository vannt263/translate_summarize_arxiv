    "segments of the edge with nonzero dimensional intersection with @xmath221 ( the four blue segments ) are non - smooth .",

    "strominger , yau , and zaslow applied physics arguments to a string - theoretic version of mirror symmetry , obtaining a remarkable prediction about mathematics .",
    "an understanding of the structure of the fibration whose existence they predicted could provide insights into both calabi ",
    "yau  geometry and mirror symmetry .",
    "the geometric conjectures of @xcite are geometrically natural but some of the strongest evidence for them was their compatibility with the combinatorial constructions of @xcite ( which provided a general formulation of the original constructions given by gross and by ruan ) .",
    "the extension of these combinatorial constructions to complete intersections is quite nontrivial .",
    "the fact that the conjecture extends naturally in a way that appears compatible with this more elaborate construction is encouraging .",
    "one new feature of the complete intersection construction is that in general the components of the combinatorial discriminant , graphs in @xmath232 for @xmath126 , will be linked and ( possibly ) knotted .",
    "we have not attempted to compute this in general .",
    "note that in this paper we have not proved the compatibility of our conjectured construction with the complete intersection combinatorics but have simply checked it in an example .",
    "it should be possible to show that for any choice of triangulation data that fully specifies the discriminant in the combinatorial construction of @xcite , the images under @xmath25 of the components of @xmath189 do indeed retract to pieces of the discriminant ; we have not attempted this . in particular , the detailed structure of @xmath14 depends on a choice of triangulation , or equivalently a choice of a limiting point of maximally unipotent monodromy in moduli space .",
    "different choices of triangulation of @xmath61 are related by flop transitions , and understanding the way the fibration changes in these would be useful .",
    "mirror symmetry was an essential ingredient in the original argument for the existence of a fibration and one of the most intriguing predictions is that the fibrations of two members of a mirror pair are related by a simple duality .",
    "one attractive feature of the combinatorial construction is that it implements this duality very naturally . the combinatorial construction for the mirror of @xmath2 is obtained by exchanging the roles of @xmath59 and @xmath208 .",
    "the construction of @xmath195 is clearly invariant under this .",
    "moreover the construction leads naturally to two dual integral affine structures sharing the same discriminant .",
    "the way in which the conjecture is compatible with this symmetry is obscured by the simple nature of our example , so it perhaps bears mention . in our example",
    ", @xmath61 was a simplex and the combinatorial structure was essentialy determined by the triangulation of @xmath230 : all the cells in a triangulation of a face of @xmath230 were paired with the same face of @xmath61 . in a more general example , the face of @xmath61 would also be triangulated .",
    "for example , in the combinatorial construction for the mirror of our example  a codimension two complete intersection in a toric variety determined by a triangulation of @xmath230  if we choose the triangulation used here , the red triangles in faces would be associated to the ambient space of @xmath313 , the blue triangles to the ambient space of @xmath336 , and the quadrilateral cells to the common ambient space of @xmath337 and @xmath338 .    * acknowledgements * : we are grateful to p.s   aspinwall , m.  bertolini , r.  castao - bernard , c.  haase , and x.  de la ossa for helpful conversations , and to d .- e .",
