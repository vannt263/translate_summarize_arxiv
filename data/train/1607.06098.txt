    "prior to decoupling at redshift @xmath3 , baryons and dark matter behave differently because they experience different forces .",
    "the universe is ionized , and the electrons are tightly coupled to the photons through thomson scattering , while the protons follow the electrons under the coulomb force . on scales within the sound horizon ,",
    "the baryons are supported against gravitational infall by the photon pressure , which is large because the photons are an important component of the energy density and are relativistic .",
    "consider the evolution of a point - like density perturbation in an otherwise homogeneous universe .",
    "it will create a photon overpressure that launches a pulse of baryons and photons outwards ( i.e. produce a baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) ) , and this pulse s front will be at the sound horizon ( sakharov 1966 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ; bond & efstathiou 1984 , 1987 ; holtzmann 1989 ; hu & sugiyama 1996 ; eisenstein & hu 1998 ; eisenstein , seo & white 2007 ; slepian & eisenstein 2016a ) .",
    "baryons and photons farther away from the overdensity than the sound horizon will not yet know about the overpressure , and so they must infall under gravity . meanwhile , the dark matter is insensitive to the photon pressure and infalls under gravity on all scales . as a result ,",
    "when the photons release the baryons at decoupling , the dark matter within the sound horizon has a head start on infalling towards the initial density perturbation : there is a baryon - dark matter relative velocity on scales within the sound horizon .",
    "the magnitude of this relative velocity depends on the magnitude of the initial density perturbation .",
    "therefore different regions of the universe have different relative velocities , and these velocities are coherent on sound - horizon ( @xmath4 ) scales .",
    "the relative velocity effect was first calculated by tseliakhovich & hirata ( 2010 ) , and shortly after ( dalal , pen & seljak 2010 ; yoo , dalal & seljak 2011 ) it was shown that this relative velocity can shift the bao signal in the 2-point clustering if the late - time luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) used for these measurements have strong memories of their earliest progenitors . in particular , the relative velocity s root mean square value at @xmath5 , when the first galaxies are expected to form , is of order @xmath6 of the smallest @xmath7 dark matter haloes circular velocities or velocity dispersions .",
    "thus small dark matter haloes living in a region of high relative velocity will find it difficult to capture baryons : the baryons kinetic energy in the dark matter s rest frame is too large .",
    "the relative velocity can therefore induce an additional modulation of the clustering of these primordial galaxies on scales out to the bao scale of @xmath4 .",
    "this modulation adds or subtracts from the primordial 2-point correlation function ( 2pcf ) within the bao scale but not outside , and so can shift the bao bump in or out in physical scale ( this configuration space picture was devloped in slepian & eisenstein 2015a , hereafter se15a ) .",
    "if the late - time lrgs used for the bao method at present have a strong memory of their early , small progenitors , the relative velocity can therefore bias the measured cosmic distance scale .",
    "note that the relative velocity is fundamentally an effect set by the relativistic sound speed prior to decoupling ; thus its large - scale coherence is unique and can not be substantially modified by later - time feedback processes as or non - linear structure formation as they operate on far smaller scales .",
    "the most recent work on this bias has shown that even a small coupling of the relative velocity to late - time galaxy formation can induce a substantial shift in the distance scale ( blazek , mcewen & hirata 2016 ) .",
    "yoo , dalal & seljak ( 2011 ) proposed that the bispectrum ( fourier space analog of the 3-point correlation function ( 3pcf ) ) could be used to measure the relative velocity bias and then correct any effect in the 2pcf , but up to now this technique has not been used .",
    "yoo & seljak ( 2013 ) used the power spectrum of galaxies to constrain the relative velocity bias in their bias model to be less than @xmath8 ; due to different normalization conventions this translates to a @xmath9 constraint in our bias model of @xmath10 , as we further detail in  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "beutler et al . (",
    "2016 ) compared different redshift slices within the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) and wigglez to look for the relative velocity effect and found no evidence for it .",
    "higher precision constraints are required : blazek , mcewen & hirata ( 2016 ) show that even a relative velocity bias of order @xmath11 of the linear bias can cause a @xmath2 shift in the distance scale , comparable with the statistical errors on the lastest boss measurement ( cuesta et al .",
    "2016 ; gil - marn et al .",
    "2016 ; alam et al .",
    "further , dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ; levi et al .",
    "2013 ) , with first light in 2019 , will improve on the boss error bars by roughly a factor of five , so even a relative velocity bias that is @xmath2 of the linear bias could systematically shift the distance scale comparably to desi s statistical error bars .",
    "given that any robustly detected deviation of the dark energy equation of state @xmath12 from @xmath13 would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark energy , high precision on the relative velocity bias is required .    in the present work",
    ", we use the 3pcf technique first proposed in yoo , dalal & seljak ( 2011 ) and developed further in se15a to constrain the relative velocity bias to be @xmath14 for the sdss boss dr12 cmass galaxies ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2011 for sdss - iii overview ; alam et al . 2015 for dr11 and dr12 ) .",
    "this precision is sufficient to ensure that the cosmic distance scale measurement from boss will not be systematically biased .",
    "it also suggests our technique is powerful enough to allow desi to avoid this bias .",
    "our measurement is the most stringent constraint on the relative velocity bias available , and illustrates the power of the 3pcf for relative velocity constraints .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in  [ sec : bias_model ] , we present our galaxy bias model including relative velocity bias .",
    " [ sec : results ] describes our relative velocity constraint , discusses the other bias parameters , and reports the cosmic distance scale measured with this bias model .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : concs ] .",
    "following se15a and slepian & eisenstein ( 2016b ; hereafter se16b ) , the galaxy overdensity field @xmath15 traces the matter density field @xmath16 and its square with two unknown bias coefficients , the linear bias @xmath17 and the non - linear bias @xmath18 .",
    "the galaxy overdensity also traces the square of the local relative velocity with a third unknown bias coefficient , the relative velocity bias @xmath9 .",
    "note that at leading order in perturbation theory , the predicted 3pcf is the same whether one uses the lagrangian or eulerian relative velocity , as further discussed in s16b  5 .",
    "the bias model is @xmath19\\\\ \\nonumber & + b_v\\left[v_{\\rm s}^2({\\vec{x}})-1\\right ] , \\label{eqn : bias_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the relative velocity s square @xmath21 normalized by its mean square value @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath16 is the matter density field , which itself must be expanded to second - order in the linear density field @xmath23 as further discussed in se15a and se16b .",
    "this bias model does not include tidal tensor biasing , for which our companion paper ( slepian et al .",
    "2016a ; hereafter s16a ) found mild evidence .",
    "future work may be incorporating a tidal tensor bias into the rv constraint ; for now we note that the tidal tensor itself contributes broadband features to the 3pcf whereas the rv has a sharp , distinctive signature .",
    "we therefore do not expect adding a tidal tensor bias to substantially change the rv constraint .    using the bias model ( [ eqn : bias_model ] ) , one can compute the 3pcf model including the relative velocity to lowest ( fourth ) order in the linear density field and including large - scale redshift - space distortions .",
    "details of this computation and the resulting model are in se16b .",
    "we note that our 3pcf model requires as an input @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 the scale factor and @xmath27 the linear growth rate . for reasons discussed in s16a",
    " 6.2 , we elect to fix @xmath28 at the beginning of our fitting , meaning that after obtaining @xmath17 from the fitting we must check that @xmath28 is self - consistent . here",
    "we adopt two different @xmath28 values : for the data , @xmath29 , while for the mocks , @xmath30 , which is consistent with the fitted value of @xmath17 averaged over all mocks .",
    "as described in s16a , we compute the 3pcf of the cmass galaxies and the covariance matrix in the gaussian random field approximation .",
    "we then fit to the 3pcf model based on the bias model in  [ sec : bias_model ] .",
    "we marginalize over @xmath31 , the value of the bao scale normalized to a fiducial sound horizon ( it is unity if we input the correct cosmology ) , and over @xmath32 , a free parameter describing deviations from the integral constraint and also intended to remove any survey - scale systematic bias .",
    "the details of our fitting are further described in s16a .",
    "our fitted parameters are displayed in table 1 ( data ) and table 2 ( mocks ) .",
    "we constrain the relative velocity bias as @xmath33 .",
    "these error bars are computed as the square root of the appropriate diagonal element of the bias covariance matrix as described in s16a .",
    "this result is highly consistent with results from two other methods of estimating the error bar .",
    "first , we know that the mock catalogs have @xmath34 ; no relative velocity biasing has been incorporated in them .",
    "our 3pcf fitting returns a mean value of @xmath35 where the mean is taken over the mocks , with a standard deviation of about @xmath36 , as shown in figure [ fig : velo_first_four ] .",
    "second , we can compute @xmath37 , the root mean square of the relative velocity bias marginalized over the integral constraint amplitude @xmath32 for each mock , as described for the other bias parameters in s16a .",
    "we then find its average over all mocks as @xmath38 .",
    "thus , all three error estimation methods concur that we can constrain the relative velocity bias with @xmath36 precision .",
    "we note that the mean @xmath9 from the mocks is @xmath39 , but that this is statistically distinguished from 0 given the @xmath40 error on the mean of the mocks .",
    "this issue is similar to the possible systematic difference of the mean @xmath41 over all mocks from unity in s16a .",
    "this value of @xmath42 for the mocks indicates that there is a small discrepancy between the bias model and the mocks , which is causing a systematic bias in this @xmath9 term .",
    "we will further explore this point with better 3pcf models and more extensive mock catalogs in future work .",
    "we now briefly discuss the other bias parameter values found for the mocks and for the data .",
    "as tables 1 and 2 show , the bias values and error bars we find are generally consistent between mocks and data .",
    "there is some disagreement between the error bar for @xmath17 from the data and from the scatter of the mocks .",
    "we achieve a strong constraint on @xmath17 , making a @xmath43 precision measurement .",
    "we do not obtain a strong constraint on @xmath18 ; as discussed in se16b and s16a , it is highly degenerate with @xmath17 and",
    "so will not be well - measured .",
    "the integral constraint amplitude value for the data is consistent with that we find for our minimal model ( with @xmath34 ) in s16a , and this is also the case for the integral constraint amplitude for the mocks .    regarding the @xmath44 , for the data we find @xmath45 , indicating that our model fits the data fairly well .",
    "for the mocks , we find an average @xmath46 , indicating that the mocks also are well - fit by the model . if the model truly describes the data or mocks , these @xmath44 have probabilities @xmath47 to occur by chance of respectively @xmath48 and @xmath49",

    "the red line indicates the data value .",
    "the upper left panel shows that the @xmath44 for our best - fit model to the data is fairly typical for a survey of this size .",
    "the upper right panel shows the difference in @xmath44 between the best - fit no - wiggle template ( with @xmath50 ) and the best - fit physical template ( with bao , and with @xmath9 free ) .",
    "our bao detection in this dataset is in the range we would expect for a survey of this size .",
    "the lower left panel of figure [ fig : velo_first_four ] shows the @xmath9 values measured for the mocks . in truth , the mocks have @xmath51 , so any @xmath52 we measure indicates the error bar on the @xmath9 constraint derived from the data . as expected , the center of the mocks @xmath9 distribution is at @xmath51 , and the scatter is @xmath36 . as table 1 indicates , for the data we find @xmath9 consistent with zero within our error bars .",
    "the right lower panel in figure [ fig : velo_first_four ] shows the root mean square @xmath37 computed from marginalizing @xmath9 and @xmath53 over the integral constraint amplitude , following the same procedure as outlined for the linear bias in s16a  5.2 .",
    "the mean @xmath37 is about @xmath54 , and the data has @xmath55 ; these values both indicate that we can constrain the relative velocity bias as @xmath56 .",
    "[ table : best_fit_params_data ]        .table of best - fit parameters for the cmass data .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath9 are the linear , non - linear , and relative velocity biases , and @xmath32 encodes the integral constraint .",
    "@xmath57 describes the @xmath44 penalty a no - bao model pays over a model with bao .",
    "the value listed here implies a @xmath58 bao detection for the velocity model . @xmath31 describes the inferred cosmic distance scale .",
    "the error bars quoted here are from the square root of the diagonal of the bias covariance matrix @xmath59 .",
    "our error bar on the linear bias corresponds to @xmath43 .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]                to convert @xmath31 into a physical distance scale @xmath60 to redshift @xmath61 , we generalize the formula for @xmath60 of anderson et al .",
    "( 2014 ) to varying @xmath62 and redshift ; we also convert to the patchy cosmology ( s16a and references therein ) and from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "we find @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the sound horizon at decoupling and @xmath67 is the sound horizon at decoupling for the patchy cosmology .",
    "we thus find @xmath68 from fitting the 2pcf of sdss dr11 including reconstruction , anderson et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found @xmath69 while from the sdss dr12 cmass 2pcf including reconstruction , cuesta et al .",
    "( 2016 ) found @xmath70 from the reconstructed multipoles of the cmass dr12 power spectrum , gil - marn et al .",
    "( 2016 ) found @xmath71 we have adjusted the measured @xmath60 s of these works appropriately to be quoted in terms of our fiducial patchy sound horizon .",
    "our velocity model measurements are therefore highly consistent with the latest 2pcf and power spectrum bao analysis results .",
    "none of the other works we quote incorporated a relative velocity bias in their fitting , but given that our data prefers a @xmath9 that is nearly zero , we indeed expect our velocity model distance scale measurement to be consistent with theirs .",
    "our slightly larger error bars reflect that we achieve a precision of roughly @xmath72 on the distance scale while the 2pcf or power spectrum measurements achieve a precision of roughly @xmath73 .",
    "our results are also consistent with the measured distance scale in the final cosmological analysis of the sdss dr12 combined sample ( alam et al . 2016 ) .",
    "we have shown that the 3pcf permits a @xmath36 precision measurement of the relative velocity bias , translating to about @xmath74 of the linear bias .",
    "we have shown three different estimates of this error bar that are all consistent with each other .",
    "for the data we find @xmath9 consistent with zero within our error bars .",
    "the constraint of yoo & seljak ( 2013 ) from the power spectrum used @xmath75 sdss dr11 galaxies to place the constraint @xmath76 . in their bias model ,",
    "the relative velocity s square is normalized by its 1-d variance , @xmath77 , which is @xmath78 the 3-d variance @xmath79 used in our bias model ( [ eqn : bias_model ] ) . holding the combination @xmath80 constant , as this is what enters the bias models , the normalization difference means that their measured @xmath9 should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath81 to be compared with ours .",
    "thus as we define @xmath9 the yoo & seljak ( 2013 ) constraint is @xmath82 .",
    "the constraint @xmath56 of this work is a factor of ten tighter .",
    "were our 3pcf technique equally good as the power spectrum analysis , we would expect a @xmath83 precision constraint ( the precisions simply scale as @xmath84 , with @xmath85 the number of galaxies ) . finding",
    "a @xmath36 constraint thus shows the superiority of the 3pcf for these measurements by roughly a factor of six .",
    "the relative velocity effect can bias the bao scale measured in the 2pcf , and thus a tight constraint on @xmath9 is essential for present surveys such as boss and future efforts like desi to remain unbiased . the constraint we find in this work is tight enough that the shift in @xmath31 measured from the 2pcf will be less than @xmath1 , using a recalculation of blazek , mcewen & hirata ( 2016 ) figure 2 for the appropriate linear bias and survey redshift for cmasss to translate @xmath86 to a shift in @xmath31 .",
    "the boss survey can thus control @xmath9 to a level equivalent to @xmath87 of its bao statistical precision . for surveys of larger volume at similar number density , this indicates that the rv effect can be sufficiently controlled .    in closing , we highlight that the consistency with zero of our measured @xmath9 for the cmass data has interesting possible implications for galaxy formation models .",
    "our constraint on @xmath9 suggests that galaxies do not have strong memories of their less - massive high redshift progenitors .",
    "given that only a small fraction of the stars in lrgs at @xmath88 were produced in the high - redshift small halos most affected by the relative velocity , this finding is not unexpected .",
    "our constraint suggests that feedback is likely efficient at erasing any differences between galaxies formed in high relative velocity regions and low relative velocity regions . while mergers also play a role in the evolution of small high - redshift halos into the lrgs used for the bao , the relative velocity s coherence scale is sufficiently large that we do not expect mergers could by themselves erase a relative velocity imprint .",
