    "the location of the position of a stellar image is possible with accuracy well below its characteristic size , when the signal to noise ratio ( @xmath1 ) is sufficiently high .",
    "the location uncertainty is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a factor keeping into account geometric factors and the centring algorithm , and @xmath4 is the root mean square width of the image @xcite .",
    "the best estimate of image position is obtained by a least square approach , evaluating the discrepancy between the data and the template describing the reference image .",
    "the location algorithm is therefore very sensitive to any variation of the actual image with respect to the selected template .",
    "it is necessary to check the compatibility between the real image and the reference profile ; also important is the capability of extracting from the data a set of parameters suitable for a new definition of the template , in order to improve its consistency with the data .",
    "self - calibration of the data , by deduction of the parameters for optimisation of the image template , is a key element in the control of the systematic effects in the position measurement .",
    "in particular , the individual spectral distribution of each object results in a signature on the image profile , due to diffraction , above all in presence of aberrations . because of these reasons , our target is the implementation of a tool for analysis of realistic images .",
    "attempts to use neural networks ( nn ) in astronomy have been performed in the past , mainly in the field of adaptive optics : details can be found e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .    in section [ imaging ]",
    "we discuss the image characterisation problem addressed in the present work ; in section [ neuralnets ] we resume the main features of sigmoidal nn and backpropagation algorithm , with a brief reminder of the specific definitions , and in section [ processing ] we describe the generation of the data set , its processing and the current results .",
    "the image of a star , considered as a point - like source at infinity , and produced by an ideal telescope , is derived in basic textbooks on optics . for an unobstructed circular pupil of diameter @xmath5 , at wavelength @xmath6 , it has radial symmetry and is described by the squared airy function [ eq : airy ] ( see @xcite for notation ) .",
    "@xmath7 ^{2 } \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the bessel function of the first kind , order one , @xmath9 a normalisation constant , and @xmath10 the aperture radius .",
    "the airy diameter , between the first two minima , is @xmath11 in angular units ; the linear scale is defined by the focal length .",
    "the diffraction image on the focal plane of _ any _ real telescope , described by a set of aberration values , for a given pupil geometry , is deduced by the square modulus of the fourier transform of the pupil function @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radial coordinates , respectively on image and pupil plane , and the integration domain corresponds to the pupil : for the circular case , @xmath16 . in case of a rectangular pupil , it is more convenient to use cartesian coordinates on both image and pupil plane , e.g. @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , integrating between the appropriate boundaries @xmath19 ; \\ ,   \\left [ \\eta_1 , \\ , \\eta_2 \\right]$ ] .",
    "+ the phase aberration @xmath20 describes for the real case the deviation from the ideal flat wavefront , i.e. the wavefront error ( wfe ) , and is usually decomposed by means of a set of functions ( e.g. the five seidel classical aberrations or zernike functions , whose first 21 terms are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab_zer ] ) : @xmath21 if @xmath22 ( non - aberrated case , @xmath23 ) , we obtain a flat wavefront , i.e. @xmath24 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : airy ] ) is retrieved for the circular pupil .",
    "the nonlinear relation between the set of aberration coefficients @xmath25 and the image is put in evidence by replacement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : aberr ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psf ] ) .",
    "in particular , the wfe is independent from wavelength , and wavelength dependence in the pupil function is shown by the @xmath26 factor .",
    "+ the real polychromatic image of an unresolved stellar source is produced by integration over the appropriate bandwidth of the monochromatic psf above , weighed by the combination of source spectral distribution , instrument transmission and detector response .",
    "thus , objects with different spectral distributions have different image profiles , and the position estimate produced by any location algorithm ( e.g. the centre of gravity , cog , or barycentre ) is affected by discrepancy with respect to the nominal position from the image generated by an ideal optical system .",
    "the variation of apparent position with source spectral distribution is what we call _ chromaticity _ , and it is relevant to high precision astrometry because in normal telescope configurations it can amount to several milliarcseconds , inducing severe limitations with respect to the measurement goal .",
    "for example , in the gaia mission @xcite , the individual exposure precision for bright objects is of order of few ten microarcseconds .",
    "it is possible to use different position estimators ( e.g. least square methods rather than cog ) , and each procedure is affected by a specific spectral sensitivity .",
    ".the 21 lowest order zernike polynomials [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]",
    "in this paper we use a neural network to diagnose and correct the chromaticity on astrometric measurements , in a framework consistent with the mission gaia .",
    "the science data are efficiently encoded in a set of low order image moments .",
    "the nn , with 300 internal nodes , is trained on a set of 20,000 data instances , and evaluated on a test set of 5820 cases .",
    "the nn diagnostics on the test set appears to be quite effective , as the rms residual chromaticity , after correction based on nn results , is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude ( factor @xmath27 ) with respect to the initial rms value ( tab .",
    "[ tab_ch_in_out ] ) .    applying the network output for correction of the chromaticity on the elementary gaia measurements , therefore",
    ", we may expect a significant reduction of this source of systematic error ; in particular , the residual chromaticity can be expected to be random , and possibly subject to further statistical averaging in subsequent measurements . a word of caution is in order , however , due to the 1.3 @xmath28 residual offset .",
    "this may not be reduced as easily by simple measurements statistics , and it would be desirable that this was close to zero . besides , it appears that the residual offset is related to the limited size of the training set , and the number of internal nodes , with respect to the large input chromaticity range .",
    "also , it may be related to the mean chromaticity of the training set , close to @xmath29 rather than zero .",
    "+ we expect that , increasing the training set and the number of nodes , the residual chromaticity offset will decrease .",
    "this will be part of the future developments .",
    "also , the sensitivity to measurement noise , as propagated to the image moments , will be subject of further investigations .",
