    "large efforts are devoted to investigate the properties of halo nuclei @xcite . in particular two - neutron halo nuclei",
    "have attracted a lot of attention with @xmath3he ( n+n+@xmath4he ) and @xmath0li ( n+n+@xmath1li ) as the most prominent examples .",
    "these nuclei are also borromean three - body systems , where all two - body subsystems are unbound @xcite .",
    "the two neutrons ( the halo ) are weakly bound to an ordinary nucleus ( the core ) .",
    "the halo is spatially extended and the two neutrons have a high probability of being outside the core .",
    "the core and halo degrees of freedom then approximately decouple and three - body models provide a good description of such systems .",
    "the most detailed properties of halo nuclei are obtained by measurements of fragment momentum distributions in breakup reactions on stable targets @xcite .",
    "the projectile energy in these reactions is very large compared to the energies of the intrinsic motion of the nucleons in the core , which in turn is much larger than the binding energies of the spatially extended halo particles .",
    "such high - energy reactions are tempting to describe in the sudden approximation where the three - body binding is removed without disturbing the motion of the constituent particles .",
    "the three halo particles continue their motion independently without any further interaction .",
    "the resulting momentum distributions then reflects the motion in the initial halo bound state of the two neutrons and the core .",
    "thus the unchanged initial three - body wave function should describe the observed momentum distributions .",
    "the fourier transform of the wave function indeed approximately reproduce the core momentum distribution @xcite",
    ". however , the calculated neutron distributions are significantly broader than measured .",
    "improvements using glauber theory are possible @xcite , but the neutron distributions within this approach are only reported for two - neutron halos in @xcite , where the two - neutron removal cross sections and the related momentum distributions are nicely described . however , an alternative is to improve the physically intuitive geometric picture established by the successful sudden approximation .",
    "the next step in such a description then amounts to instantaneous removal of one halo particle ( participant ) while the remaining two particles ( spectators ) continue to interact on the way to detection .",
    "this modification has only little influence on the core momentum distribution but affects significantly the distribution of the lighter neutron .",
    "several authors suggested that this final state interaction between the spectators plays an essential role , especially when low - lying resonances are present @xcite .",
    "indeed computations then reproduce the measured momentum distributions remarkably well when the final state interaction in a consistent calculation is precisely the same as in the initial three - body wave function @xcite .",
    "in addition the model also fairly well describes the invariant mass spectra for the two - body system consisting of the core and the remaining neutron .",
    "this successful model requires , however , a better justification .",
    "the sudden approximation assumes that the transition amplitude is proportional to the overlap between initial and final state wave functions and the momentum distributions are simply proportional to the square of this overlap .",
    "the participant - target interactions , implicitly used , are described as the schematic black sphere scattering where only absorption is considered .",
    "the obvious improvement is to use the phenomenological optical model to describe the interaction between the participant and the target @xcite .",
    "the qualitative improvement is then inclusion of elastic scattering in addition to absorption .    at the high energies , where these models mostly are tested",
    ", neutron elastic scattering is about three times smaller than neutron absorption @xcite .",
    "however , the neutron momentum distribution is much broader for elastic scattering than for absorption .",
    "the contribution from neutron scattering is therefore important .",
    "whether the predictions would agree with measurements still remains to be studied systematically .",
    "the first important step is to assume that the optical model describes the interaction between the target and the participant whereas the spectators remain undisturbed by the target but still continue their motion under the influence of their mutual interaction .",
    "the complete three - body breakup reaction is then described as a sum of these three independent contributions .",
    "we then neglect processes where two or three halo particles interact simultaneously with the target @xcite .",
    "the three - body model is strictly only valid for structureless particles .",
    "the effects of extended density distributions for the constituent particles are small when the major part of the three - body wave function is outside the radii of all the three particles .",
    "however , this requirement is usually not completely fulfilled for halo nuclei .",
    "the model is then only accurate for the outer part of the wave function .",
    "furthermore , the spatial extensions of the particles and the target allow geometric configurations where more than one halo particle during the collision must get close to the target .",
    "these configurations should be excluded in the process . for one - nucleon halos",
    "this so - called shadowing effect is known to produce smaller absolute cross sections and narrower momentum distributions @xcite . for two - neutron halos the shadowing effect was included through profile functions in sophisticated glauber calculations of three - body fragmentation reactions @xcite .",
    "we account for shadowing by excluding the participant wave function inside spheres around the two spectators @xcite .",
    "the model then consists of an initial three - body halo state , reactions caused by the participant - target optical potential , a final state with two independent two - body systems , i.e. the two spectators and the participant - target , and shadowing which excludes the wave function within spheres around the spectators .",
    "the differential cross sections are then products of the participant - target cross section and the square of the overlap previously used in the pure sudden approximation .",
    "the results from the successful sudden approximation are essentially recovered , but the model now also , via the optical potential , contains dependence on beam energy and target , distinction between longitudinal and transverse momenta and also absolute values of all the cross sections .    the purpose of this paper is to investigate the breakup reactions of @xmath0li within the three - body model sketched above .",
    "we shall show systematic computations of a number of observables and predict or compare with measurements .",
    "the results are then all correlated as arising from the same model with one set of parameters . in section",
    "ii we descibe the model and the method . in section iii",
    "we compare our results with the available experimental information and select an interaction with corresponding shadowing parameters which best fits the experimental data .",
    "section iv presents predictions for a number of observables including their energy dependence .",
    "finally section v contains a summary and the conclusions .",
    "the spatially extended three - body halo collides with a relatively small target at high energy .",
    "then the probability that more than one of the constituents interacts strongly with the target is small .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath5 is then to a good approximation a sum of three terms @xmath6 each describing the independent contribution to the process from the interaction between the target and the halo particle @xmath7 .",
    "this is the assumption used in the classical formulation for a weakly bound projectile @xcite .",
    "we neglect the binding energy of the initial three - body bound state compared to the high energy of the beam .",
    "the reaction is then described as three particles independently interacting with the target as if each particle were free .",
    "the process is described as removal of one particle @xmath7 ( participant ) while the other two particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( spectators ) both survive the reaction undisturbed ( see fig .",
    "the participant is either absorbed ( stripped ) or elastically scattered ( diffracted ) by the target .",
    "the final state then consists of two independent subsystems , i.e. the target plus participant and the two spectators .",
    "the interaction in the final state between the two spectators @xmath8 and @xmath9 must be the same as in the initial three - body bound state .",
    "this consistency is previously only reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "we shall first show how to compute fragmentation cross sections of two - neutron halo nuclei on light targets where the coulomb interaction is negligibly small .",
    "we then briefly describe how the wave functions in the initial and final states are constructed .",
    "finally we give the various interactions used in the calculations .",
    "the masses and the coordinates and their conjugate momenta are denoted @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the three halo particles and the target are labeled by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the relative coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are defined by @xmath17 the corresponding conjugate momenta are analogously denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 these momenta are related in the same way for the final states .",
    "we use primes to indicate the final state and may therefore add primes on all momenta in eq.([e21 ] ) .",
    "in particular @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the relative two - body momenta and @xmath23 is the conjugate of @xmath16 in the final state .    we can now easily express the individual momenta in terms of three relative momenta and one absolute momentum , for example @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    ". this would be natural for the initial state whereas it is more convenient to use the beam momentum and @xmath26 in the final state .",
    "we shall work in the center of mass system of the projectile where the beam momentum is @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "using total momentum conservation , @xmath29 , we obtain the individual momenta in the final state as @xmath30    the process is described as a participant - target reaction and two undisturbed spectators , i.e. momentum conservation dictates that @xmath31 in the rest frame of the projectile @xmath32 and @xmath33 . then eq.([e25 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath34    let us now first consider elastic scattering of the participant @xmath7 by the light target .",
    "we denote the initial three - body projectile wave function by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the total angular momentum and its projection on the @xmath38-axis .",
    "the final state outgoing distorted wave functions of the independent participant - target and spectator two - body subsystems are respectively @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are spin and projection quantum numbers of particle @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding spin functions are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where we for convenience assume a zero spin target .",
    "the participant - target interaction is @xmath47 , where we only consider a light target . a possible coulomb interaction",
    "can then be neglected .    the transition amplitude @xmath48 of the process , where particle @xmath7 is elastically scattered by the target while particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 are undisturbed , is most conveniently computed in the center of mass system of the three - body projectile .",
    "using momentum conservation we obtain @xmath49 this amplitude basically factorizes into particant - target elastic scattering transition amplitude @xmath50 and the overlap between initial and final states of the spectators @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 in breakup computations , where only absorption is included in the sudden approximation , the transition amplitude is proportional to the overlap @xmath51 , see @xcite .",
    "this previous approximation is therefore still valid provided the elastic scattering process can be neglected . if furthermore the final state interaction between the two spectators is neglected the overlap in eq.([eq3 ] )",
    "reduces to the fourier transform of the projectile wave function @xmath53 .",
    "this is the approximation used in the first attempt to understand these fragmentation reactions @xcite .",
    "the differential diffraction ( elastic scattering ) cross section is then given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the velocity of the target seen from the projectile rest frame and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the relative energies of particle @xmath7 and the target in the initial and final states .",
    "we use here the non - relativistic expressions , since the optical model is non - relativistic although obtained through a relativistic procedure , see the discussion later in the paper . the reduced mass of particle @xmath7 and the target is here",
    "denoted @xmath58 . then energy conservation demands that @xmath59 .",
    "the density of final states @xmath60 is given by @xmath61    the differential diffraction cross section in eq.([e7 ] ) can now also be rewritten in factorized form .",
    "when the participant @xmath7 has spin 0 or 1/2 and the target has spin 0 , we get , as shown in appendix a , the expression @xmath62 where the first factor is the differential cross section for the participant - target elastic scattering process , @xmath63 which is normalized to one , i.e. gives unity after integration over @xmath64 and @xmath65 or equivalently , by use of eq.([e3 ] ) , over @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "we also consider the other process , where the participant in the sense of the optical model is absorbed by the target .",
    "we obtain analogously the corresponding differential absorption ( stripping ) cross section in the same factorized form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the participant - target absorption cross section .",
    "the nine - dimensional differential cross section is now reduced to six , since the absorped or stripped particle inherently is of no interest in the optical model description .",
    "it is conceptually important to realize that the factorizations in eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) are incomplete , since @xmath69 in the participant - target cross sections is related to @xmath66 or ( @xmath64 ) in eq.([sudden ] ) via the momentum conservation in eq.([e3 ] ) . for high energy reactions",
    "the factorization is in practice fairly accurate for two reasons .",
    "first the range of @xmath70-values is limited to an interval around @xmath71 determined by the size of the relatively small momenta in the motion of the particles within the projectile , see eq.([e21 ] ) .",
    "second the factor arising from the participant - target cross section depends only weakly on energy for the large beam energies corresponding to this rather small range of @xmath70-values .",
    "computations of the fragmentation cross sections are now essentially reduced to computations of the overlap matrix element @xmath72 from @xcite ( modified to account for shadowing by omission of the unwanted cnofiguartions ) and the two - body elastic and absorption cross sections determined by the optical model phase shifts . a target with zero spin ,",
    "e.g. an even - even nucleus like @xmath73c , and a neutron with spin 1/2 as the participant particle is of particular interest for halo nuclei .",
    "we then have @xcite @xmath74 @xmath75 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the angle between @xmath69 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the phase shift of the partial wave @xmath79 when the total angular momentum is @xmath8 .",
    "the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 \\ ;   p_\\ell(\\cos \\theta )   \\ ; , \\label{gfu }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath79th legendre polynomial .",
    "the two contributions ( stripping and diffraction or absorption and scattering ) arising from the interaction @xmath47 to any measurable cross section is now obtained by integration over the unobserved momenta in eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the total cross section is given by the sum of both contributions and the weight of each of them is directly dictated by the optical potential .",
    "we shall compute individual as well as relative momentum distributions in the final state both along @xmath85 ( longitundinal ) and perpendicular to @xmath85 ( transverse ) .",
    "in addition to momentum distributions we shall also compute other observables like the invariant mass spectrum of the two particles in the final state .",
    "this mass is invariant under lorentz transformations and therefore independent of coordinate system . in particular , in the rest system for the particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 the invariant mass reduces for the relevant small energies to the non - relativistic kinetic energy @xmath86 of this two - body system",
    ". then the momentum variable @xmath87 can be substituted by @xmath88 by use of @xmath89 .",
    "another recently investigated observable is the angular distribution of the relative momentum between the spectators @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a coordinate system with the @xmath38-axis along the center of mass of their total momentum in the final state .",
    "the decisive variable is then the angle between @xmath21 and @xmath90 , where the latter vector is given in eq.([e3 ] ) . to compute this angular distribution we express the differential cross sections as functions of @xmath91 and @xmath21 and integrate over all the variables except the angle between these two vectors .",
    "the necessary integrations require variable changes in the description of the final state .",
    "the expressions in eq.([e23 ] ) provide useful identities for this purpose , i.e. @xmath92    we have so far only considered the two contributions coming from the stripping and the diffraction of particle @xmath7 via the interaction @xmath47 .",
    "however , the reaction in question may also be a result of the other interactions @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "these cross sections are then simply added .",
    "possible interference terms are neglected , since they in any case are small for spatially extended projectiles . from eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) we expect that the absolute values all are of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding participant - target cross sections .",
    "the initial three - body wave function @xmath53 of the projectile is obtained by solving the faddeev equations in coordinate space @xcite .",
    "we use the three sets of hyperspherical coordinates ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 , where each @xmath7 is related to a given jacobi system , see @xcite .",
    "then @xmath53 is a sum of the three faddeev components , which in turn for each hyperradius @xmath97 are expanded in a complete set of generalized angular functions @xmath98 @xmath99 where @xmath100 is related to the volume element @xmath101 with the angular part @xmath102 .",
    "these angular wave functions satisfy the angular part of the three faddeev equations , i.e. @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath105 , @xmath10 is a normalization mass , @xmath106 is the two - body interaction between particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath107 is the @xmath97-independent part of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "the analytic expressions for @xmath108 and the kinetic energy operator can , for instance , be found in @xcite .",
    "the radial expansion coefficients @xmath109 are obtained from the coupled set of `` radial '' differential equations @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an anticipated three - body potential and the functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 are defined as the angular integrals @xmath114    the continuum wave function @xmath115 describing the two - body spectator system in the final state is expanded in partial waves @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a clebsch - gordon coefficient , @xmath118 is the spherical harmonic and @xmath119 is the angular wave function obtained by coupling orbital @xmath79 and spin @xmath120 to the total angular momentum and projection @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "the distorted radial wave functions @xmath121 are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with the appropriate two - body potential . when this interaction between the two spectators in the final state is neglected the expansion in eq.([2beq ] )",
    "reduces to the usual expansion of plane waves in terms of spherical bessel functions .",
    "the participant - target interaction is described by the optical potential while the spectators remain unaffected .",
    "the finite extension of the projectile and the target therefore in addition requires exclusion of configurations where the spectators pass the target too close to the participant .",
    "this corresponds to black sphere models describing the spectator - target interactions .",
    "this so - called shadowing strictly requires exclusion of the initial projectile wave function in an infinitely long cylinder with the axis along the motion of the participant .",
    "however , such a cylinder depends on the dynamics of the reaction and omission of these events would be technically difficult in large scale systematic computations .",
    "instead we approximate the shadowing by excluding spheres of the wave function where the participant is close to the spectators .",
    "this is much simpler and has also the appealing feature that major parts of the three - body wave function describing configurations , where the spatially extended particles are inside the radii of each other , simultaneously are excluded .",
    "then the contribution from densities , where halo and core nucleons overlap , decreases and consequently the possible uncertainty due to the treatment of the pauli principle must be diminished or perhaps completely eliminated @xcite .",
    "thus we account for the shadowing effect by substituting zero for the initial three - body wave function @xmath53 when the distances between participant @xmath7 and the two spectators @xmath8 and @xmath9 are smaller than the shadowing parameters @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "here we indicated that one neutron reacts with the target while the core and the other neutron are spectators . instead of this sharp cutoff a smooth function ,",
    "varying from zero at small distances to one at large distances , could easily be used to eliminate the unwanted geometric configurations .",
    "the cutoff radii are in any case related to the sizes of target and spectators . with the core or nucleon as spectators a reasonable parametrization",
    "could then be @xmath124 where we for simplicity omitted the superscripts @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "the mass numbers of target and core are @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( @xmath129 for @xmath0li ) and @xmath130 fm is the sharp cutoff radius of the nucleon .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath131 fm , which is adjusted to reproduce the few reported absolute values of two - neutron removal cross sections .",
    "this somewhat large value of @xmath132 may reflect a parametrization where the range of the nuclear interaction is included .",
    "the shadowing effect substantially reduces the absolute values of the cross sections @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity in addition to the approximate nature of the treatment of shadowing indicates that the predicted absolute values are less accurate than desired . on the other hand",
    "the shapes of the distributions are fairly insensitive to the shadowing parameters although the effects are significant at the present level of accuracy .",
    "the model described in the previous subsections needs specifications of the interactions appropriate for the process under investigation .",
    "we shall here focus on the fragmentation of a @xmath0li ( @xmath1li + n + n ) projectile on a carbon target and divide the parameters into five sets , i.e. ( i ) the four two - body interactions between neutron - neutron , ( ii ) neutron-@xmath1li , ( iii ) neutron - carbon and ( iv ) @xmath1li - carbon two - body systems and ( v ) the three - body interaction for the @xmath0li three - body system .    _",
    "the neutron - neutron interaction _ @xmath133 contains central , spin - orbit , tensor and spin - spin interactions , i.e. @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the relative orbital angular momentum , @xmath136 is the tensor operator , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the spins of the two neutrons and @xmath139 .",
    "we assume gaussian shapes for each of the radial potentials @xmath140 .",
    "the parameters are adjusted to reproduce the experimental low - energy neutron - neutron scattering data for @xmath120 and @xmath2-waves .",
    "different radial shapes and in general more elaborate potentials have previously been used in the present context .",
    "the results are essentially indistinguishable from each other provided the scattering lengths and effective ranges remain unchanged .",
    "we shall therefore use the interactions specified in @xcite , where the corresponding @xmath120 and @xmath2-wave scattering lengths and effective ranges also are given .",
    "the _ neutron-@xmath1li interaction _ is not very well known , although several pieces of information are available .",
    "the low - energy properties are almost exclusively determined by @xmath120 and @xmath2-waves and we shall therefore only include these lowest partial waves .",
    "the neutron @xmath141-state is bound by about 4 mev in @xmath1li and due to pauli blocking this state is unavailable for the valence neutron .",
    "we are then left with the @xmath142 and @xmath143-states .",
    "the total neutron angular momentum of 1/2 for each of these states then couple to the @xmath1li - spin of 3/2 resulting in two pairs of spin - split states with angular momenta 1 and 2 and parities corresponding to @xmath120 and @xmath2-states , respectively .",
    "the interaction in the present three - body calculations are determined by the low - energy scattering properties , which in turn determine positions and widths of resonances and virtual states .",
    "these positions are in fact the decisive properties of the interaction and the parametrization of the force is in itself rather unimportant .",
    "we have therefore basically only four parameters of physical importance , i.e. the four positions of the @xmath120 and @xmath2-states .",
    "furthermore , the fragmentation results are only sensitive to the statistically averaged positions of the @xmath120 and @xmath2-states , i.e. the spin - splitting , almost unavoidable for the strong interaction , does not significantly influence the computed differential cross sections , see the next section .",
    "the relative position of the @xmath120 and @xmath2-states determines the @xmath144-content in the three - body wave function of @xmath0li .",
    "the @xmath120 and @xmath2-wave content are roughly believed to be of the same order as shown in both calculations and interpretations of experimental fragmentation data @xcite .",
    "this amount of @xmath2-wave admixture strongly influences the fragmentation cross sections , which in addition also are very sensitive to the binding energy or equivalently to the radius of @xmath0li .",
    "thus we have two crucial parameters ( @xmath120 and @xmath2-state positions ) and two sensitive observables ( three - body binding and @xmath2-wave content ) .",
    "however , this perfect match is upset by additional experimental information , especially knowledge about a @xmath2-resonance in the neutron-@xmath1li system @xcite .",
    "as we shall see all three experimental constraints can only be reproduced simultaneously by use of a three - body interaction , which then is constructed to add the missing binding energy in the three - body system .    we shall therefore first concentrate on the neutron-@xmath1li two - body system .",
    "we assume central , spin - spin and spin - orbit terms in the neutron - core interaction , i.e. @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the relative orbital angular momentum , @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the intrinsic spins of the neutron and the core . as for the neutron - neutron interaction the radial potentials",
    "@xmath149 are gaussians , adjusted independently for each partial wave .",
    "we choose a large inverse spin - orbit strength to make the @xmath141-interaction sufficiently repulsive to avoid any contribution of this partial wave in the three - body wave function .",
    "furthermore we shall use a shallow @xmath120-wave potential without bound states .",
    "this automatically excludes the lowest pauli forbidden neutron - core @xmath120-state from the three - body wave function @xcite .    as an important constraint we shall use the `` strong evidence '' for a @xmath2-resonance at @xmath150 kev with a width of @xmath151 kev @xcite .",
    "we then place the lowest @xmath143-resonance at 0.5 mev with a width of 0.4 mev consistent with the experimental values .",
    "we choose rather arbitrarily the total spin of this state to be 1 .",
    "the range of the gaussian interaction is in this way determined to be @xmath152 fm .",
    "a different range produces different widths of the resonances .",
    "we then continue again somewhat arbitrarily by placing the other @xmath143-resonance at 0.92 mev . to get a potential at the limit without a three - body potential we determine the statistically averaged position of the two @xmath142-states to be at 350 kev such that the experimental @xmath0li binding energy is reproduced .",
    "this fixes the strength of the @xmath120-interaction when we use the same range as for the @xmath2-interaction .",
    "finally we use the spin - spin interaction to place the lowest @xmath142-state of total spin 2 at an energy of 230 kev .",
    "this potential , labeled @xmath153 , leads to a 30% @xmath2-wave content in the @xmath0li wave function .",
    "we could as well have chosen the lowest @xmath142-state with total spin 1 at the same energy of 230 kev .",
    "the results for such a potential would be indistiguishable provided that the average energy of the @xmath142-states is the same @xcite .",
    "we could also have chosen a different position for the highest @xmath143-state . however",
    ", a lower value than 0.92 mev would place the two @xmath143-states rather close .",
    "a higher value would require a lower statistically averaged position of the @xmath142-states , provided the @xmath0li binding energy remains unchanged , and the resulting @xmath2-wave content then becomes unreasonably small ( below 30% ) in disagreement with the fragmentation data @xcite .",
    "we can now increase the @xmath2-wave content by increasing the statistically averaged position of the @xmath142-states while the parameters for the @xmath2-waves remain unchanged .",
    "the resulting underbinding of @xmath0li must then be compensated by an attractive three - body force . in this way",
    "we construct potential i with 40% @xmath2-wave content .",
    "again we could have chosen a different position for the highest @xmath143-state while maintaining a reasonable @xmath2-wave content between 35% and 40%.however , a lower value would    .parameters for various neutron-@xmath154li interactions .",
    "the form is given in eq.([e27 ] ) and the radial shapes are all gaussians , @xmath155 , with ranges @xmath156 fm and strengths denoted by @xmath157 and @xmath158 with @xmath159 for @xmath120 and @xmath2-waves , respectively .",
    "the strength parameter for the corresponding three - body interaction , @xmath160 with @xmath161 fm , are also given .",
    "the lower part of the table contains @xmath2-wave content in % in the @xmath0li wave function and the four energies of the resonances and virtual states @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",

    "the variable is then @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) and integration of this momentum distribution over @xmath168 ( or @xmath169 ) gives the transverse momentum .",

    "they are not added in the figure where the total distribution then only includes contributions from the participant neutrons .",

    "[ fig12 ] reveals direct information about the neutron momentum distribution in the initial three - body system .",
    "the process is removal ( stripping or diffraction ) of one halo neutron by the target with the remaining @xmath170li system as the two spectators . in the center of mass of the three - body projectile the momentum distributions of @xmath170li and the participant neutron are then identical .",
    "this observable is insensitive to the final state interaction where the opposite erroneously was postulated in @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the sensitivity to the shadowing parameters is large @xcite .",
    "experimental data could then be very useful to check the validity of the shadowing parameters extracted in the previous section from the comparison between computed momentum distributions and available experimental data .",
    "the final state momentum of the participant neutron does not enter in the measured momentum and the longitudinal and transverse @xmath170li momentum distribution are therefore identical .",
    "this can also be understood from the fact that the initial three - body momentum of the participant neutron does not have a preferred direction .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] again shows the variation of the distribution with the beam energy .",
    "the behavior is the same as discussed in connection with the previous figures .",
    "the related key numbers are given in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "the momentum distributions were recently supplemented by an angular correlation measurement , where the observable is the angular distribution of the relative momentum between the detected neutron and the core in a coordinate system with the @xmath38-axis along the center of mass momentum of the neutron - plus - core spectator system @xcite .",
    "this observable is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] for our standard case of @xmath0li fragmentation on carbon . in the computation we assumed that @xmath76 is constructed as the angle between the momentum of the center of mass of the @xmath170li spectator system and the relative momentum between @xmath154li and the spectator neutron .",
    "the small contributions , where the neutron or the core in @xmath170li are the scattered participants , are not included in this figure , because they are small and furthermore almost completely excluded in the experiment .",

    "the computations as always involve eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath120-wave alone produces a constant angular distribution .",
    "the @xmath2-wave alone produces a distribution of the form @xmath171 , i.e. symmetric around @xmath172 . for @xmath2-waves with the projection @xmath173 on the @xmath170li momentum",
    ", @xmath174 is very small and negative , whereas @xmath174 for @xmath175 is positive and of the order one . in other words",
    "the variation in the angular distribution is almost entirely due to the @xmath2-wave with projection 0 .",
    "if both @xmath120 and @xmath2-waves are present the distribution takes the form @xmath176 , i.e. becomes asymmetric due to mixing between these partial waves .",
    "thus our pronounced asymmetry arises from the @xmath120 and @xmath2 mixing term , which dominates the angular variation , since the largest contribution from the @xmath120-wave alone is constant .",
    "a dominating @xmath2-wave would have produced a much more symmetric distribution .",
    "substantial deviations between measured and computed distributions would indicate a selective reaction mechanism emphasizing specific partial waves .",
    "the shape of the angular distribution is independent of the beam energy as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "only the absolute values of the cross section changes in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the shape in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] deviates slightly from that of @xcite due to the higher @xmath2-wave content .",
    "the momentum distributions reveal properties of the initial three - body system and the reaction mechanism .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath170li after fragmentation of @xmath0li on a light target carry in addition information about the properties of the two - body system . the computed spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , where we only included contributions from the spectator neutron , i.e. the invariant mass @xmath177 is constructed with the momentum of the spectator neutron even when the participant neutron is scattered by the target . in the center of mass system of @xmath170li",
    "the invariant mass is , apart from the rest mass , simply the total kinetic energy of the two - body system .",
    "the spectrum must start from zero due to the phase space .",
    "the very low - lying peak is a signature of a dominating @xmath120-wave contribution .",
    "the height of the peak , not the position , reflects the energy of the underlying two - body virtual @xmath120-state .",
    "in contrast , a dominating @xmath2-wave contribution produces a peak at the energy of the corresponding two - body resonance . in the present case the @xmath2-wave contribution is smeared out in a region around 0.5 mev .",
    "a narrow @xmath2-wave resonance would show up as a peak in this invariant mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the measured spectrum then indicates a low - lying @xmath120-state and a higher - lying @xmath2-resonance with a moderate width , see fig .",
    "[ fig4]c , where the curve computed with potential i is the same as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] for a beam energy of 280 mev / u .",
    "the contributions from stripping and diffraction as well as the energy dependence shown in the inset is consistent with the results in fig .",
    "the energy dependence of the peak heights and the widths are given in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "as seen in table [ tab3 ] all the cross sections first decrease with energy and then after a minimum slowly increase again .",
    "when the contribution from the scattered neutron is included the widths follow qualitatively the same pattern , although much less pronounced , and in particular they essentially do not vary for energies above around 200 mev / u .",
    "when only the spectator neutron contributes the widths are energy independent .",
    "this behavior disagrees with that of @xcite , but is on the other hand consistent with the experimental results described in @xcite .    in this comparison",
    "we implied that our fwhm is the same quantity as the width ( or @xmath178-values ) discussed in previous experimental papers .",
    "although these quantities are strongly correlated this is not strictly true , since the fwhm precisely is defined as the full width at half maximum of the computed distribution whereas the experimental width is obtained as the width parameter in a fitted function .",
    "this easily shifts the emphasis from the small momenta in the calculations to the large momenta of the tail in the experimental analysis .",
    "this could easily produce uncertainties of several mev in the fwhm .    as we have demonstrated the distributions are more complicated than simple one - parameter functions .",
    "comparison of our fwhm with published experimental widths could then be rather misleading .",
    "the only safe procedure is to compare directly with the experimental data as we did throughout this paper . on the other hand",
    "then we immediately face the problem that the data too often include purely experimental effects related to beam profile , acceptance range , resolution and target thickness .",
    "it is therefore important to compare with the properly interpreted data or alternatively to fold the experimental effects with the calculated results .",
    "fragmentation reactions of weakly bound two - neutron halo nuclei provide detailed information about structure and reaction mechanism of corresponding three - body systems .",
    "the three - body structure can be computed to the needed accuracy provided the interactions are specified whereas the reactions are much more difficult to treat propertly .",
    "our aim is to understand and describe the principal features of all fragmentation observables qualitatively and quantitatively to an accuracy comparable with that of the experimental data . as an important step",
    "we have chosen to investigate @xmath0li considered as a three - body system in a physically simple and transparent model based on geometric properties and phenomenological interactions .",
    "one main assumption is often the sudden approximation where the reaction is instantaneous .",
    "the reaction time must then be short compared to the intrinsic time scale of the relative motion of both the three halo particles and the nucleons in the target and the core .",
    "thus the intrinsic motion must be frozen during the collision or equivalently the beam energy must be large compared to the three - body binding energy and the fermi energy of the target and the core . as expected this approximation has successfully passed the tests at high energies .    in the present model",
    "we do not directly use the sudden approximation .",
    "we fully include the interaction between the target and each of the halo particles by use of a phenomenological optical model .",
    "the description of the interactions is then only limited by the validity range of the parameters employed in the optical model . on the other hand",
    "then only elastic scattering is described in details while all other processes are included as absorption from the elastic channel .",
    "fortunately this is precisely the level of information required in discussions of fragmentation reactions , because the inelastic channels overwhelmingly produce different reaction products or particles scattered outside the detection range in the forward direction .",
    "furthermore we only include the interaction between one halo particle ( participant ) and the target while neglecting the interactions between the other two halo particles ( spectators ) and the target .",
    "in addition we also neglect the interactions between the spectators and the participant - target system in the final state .",
    "the halo particles must then interact independently with the target as three spatially correlated but non - interacting clusters of nucleons .",
    "the motion of the spectators must remain undisturbed by the participant - target interaction .",
    "more precisely the two criteria for the validity of the model are that ( i ) the sum of the participant and target radii is less than the halo radius and ( ii ) the intrinsic velocity of the partipant within the halo is much smaller than the velocity of the projectile or perhaps better that the characteristic time for the intrinsic halo motion is much larger than the collision time .",
    "these main approximations are justified for weakly bound and spatially extended halos colliding with a target with an energy per nucleon larger than the intrinsic kinetic energy of the participant within the halo , i.e. roughly the usual fermi energy for nuclei although in principle unrelated to the fermi energies of the nucleons within target and core . with these approximations",
    "one halo particle can interact with the target without disturbing the motion of the other two .",
    "the total cross section is obtained by adding the contributions from the three possible participants .",
    "the sudden approximation is reached when the optical model is reduced to a black sphere when the elastic scattering also is neglected .",
    "the model is described for point particles and the necessary generalization to finite radii involves the concept of shadowing .",
    "we eliminate the geometric configurations in the three - body wave function where the spectators move in the shadow of the participant .",
    "the need for this correction arises from the simplifying choice of treating the participant - target interaction properly while leaving the spectators untouched in their initial state . if the spectators are close to the participant they would be either absorped or similarly scattered .",
    "however , these events contribute in the model computations with the probability given in the initial wave function .",
    "consequently we must omit those unwanted configurations .",
    "another improved treatment with better final state wave functions could directly take these effects into account .    to use the model we must specify the interactions and the shadowing parameters . within the halo projectile we have the neutron - neutron and neutron - core interactions supplemented by the three - body force .",
    "they are parametrized as gaussians to reproduce the @xmath0li binding energy , give a neutron-@xmath1li @xmath143-resonance at 0.5 mev with a width of 0.4 mev and finally to produce about 40% of @xmath144-configurations in the @xmath0li wave function .",
    "these requirements are necessary to reproduce various experimental data .",
    "the only freedom left for the halo interactions is then the spin - splitting , arising from the two different couplings to the core spin of @xmath179 , of both the @xmath142 and @xmath143-states in the neutron - core system .",
    "the related spin - splitting parameters influence neither the above data nor the fragmentation data .",
    "good agreement with the data then indicates approximately correct statistically averaged positions of the @xmath120 and @xmath2-states in @xmath170li , i.e. 0.71 mev and 0.76 mev .",
    "the two - body interactions between halo particles and target are described by use of the phenomenological optical model with parameters adjusted to reproduce the corresponding elastic scattering and absorption cross section data .",
    "the two shadowing parameters related to the sizes of halo particles and target are determined to reproduce both the absolute two - neutron removal cross section and the momentum distributions after fragmentation .",
    "we compute all momentum distributions related to fragmentation of @xmath0li on carbon .",
    "for the same reactions we also compute the invariant mass of @xmath0li and the neutron angular distribution , which recently was measured for @xmath180he fragmentation .",
    "these observables are in general consistent with the available measurements .",
    "when the neutron and core participants are scattered they receive momentum tranfer perpendicular to the beam and the transverse momentum distributions are therefore broader than the corresponding longitudinal distributions .",
    "this is then a direct effect of the diffraction mechanism .",
    "the distribution for neutrons is relatively narrow due to the final state interaction , which affects the core less .",
    "the distribution for the center of mass of the core - plus - neutron spectators is the broadest reflecting the extension of the initial wave function .",
    "increasing the shadowing parameters decrease the widths of the distributions .",
    "the invariant mass reveals information about the low - lying continuum structure of the neutron - plus - core system .",
    "the large and very low - lying peak is the signature of a low - lying virtual @xmath120-state while the shoulder indicates a low - lying and fairly broad @xmath2-resonance",
    ". the angular correlation of the emitted neutrons in the neutron - plus - core center of mass system is highly asymmetric revealing that @xmath120 and @xmath2 relative neutron - core states roughly are equally populated in @xmath0li .",
    "the experimental data are available for several energies and targets , but systematic high precision data given as function of energy for one target does not exist at the moment .",
    "we can compute absolute values of a number of differential cross sections .",
    "however , in this paper we confined ourselves to the energy dependence of three - body observables for fragmentation on a carbon target with one excursion to an aluminum target .",
    "the distributions are essentially independent of target , but the absolute differential cross sections increase with target size .",
    "the scaling with target size seems to be somewhat larger than the square of the target radius .",
    "the energy dependence for the given carbon target is computed for a @xmath0li beam of 50 to 900 mev / u .",
    "the widths of the distributions are essentially constant above around 200 mev / u and slightly increasing towards lower energies .",
    "the absolute values follow the participant - target cross sections . for neutrons",
    "this means a smooth increase with energy above around 150 mev / u and a strong increasee towards lower energies .",
    "furthermore diffraction contributes much less than absorption at energies above 200 mev / u whereas the inverse is true for energies below 50 mev / u .",
    "this has the consequence that the widths of the transverse distributions are broader at low energies due to the domination of diffraction .",
    "these predictions presupposes that the model is valid at the low energies and the energy dependence of the parameters are correctly included .",
    "the criteria for validity indicated relative neutron - target energies above around 20 to 30 mev and perhaps even lower for very pronounced halo systems .",
    "the optical model parameters for the neutron - carbon potential are adjusted to scattering data down to these energies , but the shadowing parameters are assumed to be constant .",
    "these parameters have a strong influence on the absolute values of the cross sections and a significant , but much less pronounced , influence on the shapes of the distributions .",
    "the predicted widths could perhaps be systematically changed by small amounts due to such possible energy dependence .    in conclusion",
    ", we computed systematically essentially all observables for the @xmath0li three - body fragmentation on a carbon target .",
    "the same consistent model is used throughout .",
    "most of the computations are in agreement with available measurements .",
    "this strongly indicates that the reaction mechanism essentially is correctly described in the model .",
    "the predictions are therefore useful as the unit for comparison with future experimental data .",
    "detection of discrepancies would then be significant and therefore also very suggestive of necessary improvements like , for eaxmple , different dependencies of some of the parameters .",
    "the same consistent model for all observables is crucial at the present level of accuracy and understanding . in this connection",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that treating @xmath0li as a three - body system is an approxomation and the intrinsic structure must be unavoidable at some point in the interpretation .",
