    "we compare results of the present calculation using both the ry closure and the kr procedure to calculate pair correlation functions for n=3 with the results found from other free - energy functionals as reported in ref @xmath225 $ ] .",
    "the experimental results obtained from real - space microscopy measurements of magnetic colloids confined to an air - water interface [ 13 ] and values found from numerical simulations [ 30,31 ] are also given in the table .",
    "while the ry closure gives slightly higher values of @xmath226 and @xmath227 compared to experimental values , the kr closure gives slightly lower values .",
    "but these values along with the values of other parameters , particularly the values of @xmath228 , are in better agreement with the experimental values compared to any other versions of the dft .",
    "although the extended modified weighted - density approximation ( ema ) [ 32 ] with verlet closure [ 33 ] gives values of @xmath226 which is close to the one found by us using the kr closure , but the values of @xmath229 is significantly lower ; @xmath230 compared to the values found by us @xmath231 , and the experimental value , @xmath232 .",
    "the real - space experimental data are not available for other systems .",
    "the computer simulation results [ 34 , 35 ] show the liquid - solid transition at @xmath233 and @xmath234 respectively for @xmath235 and @xmath184 .",
    "these values are close to the one given in table 1 .",
    "we used a free energy functional that contains both the symmetry - conserving part of the dpcf @xmath104 and the symmetry - broken part @xmath236 to investigate the freezing of a two - dimensional fluid into a two - dimensional crystal of hexagonal lattice .",
    "the values of @xmath104 and its derivatives with respect to density @xmath105 as a function of interparticle separation r have been determined using an integral equation theory comprising the oz equation and the closure relations of roger and young [ 26 ] and of kang and ree [ 27 ] . for soft potential ( n=3 ) the two results",
    "are found to differ ; the kr closure seems to give better result . for more repulsive potentials the two results are close as shown in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath236 which is functional of @xmath29 and is invariant only under discrete set of translations and rotations , we used an expansion in ascending powers of order parameters .",
    "this expansion involves higher body direct correlation functions of isotropic phase , which in turn were found from the density derivatives of @xmath104 using a method proposed by barrat et.al [ 8 ] .",
    "the contribution of symmetry - broken part of dpcf to the free energy is found to depend on nature of pair potentials ; the contribution increases with softness of potentials .",
    "this result is in agreement with that found in three - dimensions and explains why the ramakrishnan - yussouff free - energy functional was found to give a reasonably good description of the freezing transition of hard core potentials but failed for potentials that have soft core and/or attractive tail .",
    "the results found here and the results reported for 3d indicate that the theory described here can be used to investigate the freezing transitions of all kinds of fluids .",
    "since our free energy functional takes into account the spontaneous symmetry breaking it can be used to study various phenomena of ordered phases .",
    "the results indicate that the density - functional approach provides an effective frame work for theoretical study of a large variety of problems involving inhomogeneities . however , the question not adequately addressed yet is the size of fluctuations effect which play important role in two - dimensional systems .",
    "the other important question is the inclusion of hexatic phase in the theory .",
