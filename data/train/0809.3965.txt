    "table  3 from @xcite allows to estimate that h@xmath35(1 - 0)s(1 ) represents 21.8% of the total h@xmath35 contribution in the 2mass k@xmath29 filter . therefore h@xmath35 ro - vibrational emission can account for the entire 2mass k@xmath29 band flux .",
    "this work focusses on the 31  ghz continuum as seen by the cbi .",
    "yet inspection of the _ wmap _  ka map reveals that the entire @xmath0  oph cloud is outlined at 33  ghz , albeit at @xmath39 the intensities in @xmath0  oph  w. in particular the eastern filamentary extensions of @xmath0  oph , ldn  1729 and ldn  1712 , at 0.03  mjy  sr@xmath20 and 0.016  mjy  sr@xmath20 , are not detected in the 2.3  ghz map of ( * ? ? ? * in which no region of @xmath0  oph has a counterpart ) .",
    "the diffuse emission surrounding our 45  arcmin centred on @xmath0  oph  w , also appears to have a positive spectral index between 2.3  ghz and 33  ghz @xmath40 . if we correct for a diffuse background at 0.03  mjy  sr@xmath20 , the wmap  33  ghz flux density inside the cbi pb aperture drops from 14  jy to @xmath19  jy .",
    "ci can better accomodate a reduced 33  ghz flux density , since the 2.3  ghz ",
    "33  ghz rise is shallower ( @xmath40 drops from 0.69 to 0.52 ) .",
    "but what is the origin of the background ?",
    "the first possibility that springs to mind is spinning dust , which does not require an ionisation source , and scales linearly with density .",
    "we could also envision an ensemble of ci - emitting dense clumps illuminated by the general interstellar uv field . in this case",
    "the specific intensity in the optically thin regime at 33  ghz can be written @xmath41 where l is the depth of the @xmath0  oph cloud , @xmath42 is the filling factor , and @xmath43 is as in eq .",
    "[ eq : ciistromgren ] . an upper limit to the product @xmath44 can be obtained by ionisation balance in ionisation - bounded clumps @xmath45 for clumps with depth @xmath46 and area @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the flux of c - ionising photons per unit area in the interstellar radiation field @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath50 , the depth of a single clump , then we have an upper limit to any ci continuum diffuse background intensity @xmath51 the interstellar radiation field of @xcite gives @xmath52mjy  sr@xmath20 , which is satisfyingly a factor of four above the observed values in @xmath0  oph .",
    "as in the case of @xmath0  oph  w ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ci ] ) , we require beam - diluted optically thick clumps covering a solid angle of @xmath53 . thus to explain the absence of @xmath0  oph in @xcite with a noise of @xmath130  mk and a beam of 20  arcmin fwhm , the projected linear size of the clump ensemble should be @xmath54arcmin , if @xmath55k . in @xmath0",
    "oph  w such narrow dimmensions could perhaps be interpreted as a very narrow cii shell around hd  147889 .",
    "but for the diffuse emission such a geometry seems very contrived .",
    "we have found that the well - studied and nearby molecular cloud @xmath0  oph is surprisingly bright at 31  ghz , or @xmath11  cm wavelengths .",
    "the most conspicuous feature revealed by the cbi data is the @xmath0  oph  w pdr .",
    "comparison with _",
    "wmap _ images shows that the cm - emission is not the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sub - mm emitting dust .",
    "bulk dust properties are inferred from new _ iso_-lws parallel mode data .",
    "archival _ spitzer _",
    "data allows quantifying pah emission .",
    "none of the comparison images match the cbi data , except for irac  8  @xmath19 m and 2mass  k@xmath29 , which closely follow the 31  ghz ridge along @xmath0  oph  w. _ spitzer _  irs spectroscopy in four apertures hint at a possible correlation between 31  ghz intensity and the h@xmath35 pure - rotational lines : the h@xmath35 lines are detected only where 31  ghz intensities are bright ( i.e. towards sr  3 and @xmath0  oph  w , and not in the vicinity of s  1 ) .",
    "we considered several interpretations for the 31  ghz emision , requiring either an additional radio continuum component such as magnetic or spinning dust , or unexpected physical conditions , such as in a very dense and cold plasma .",
    "we find that both spinning dust and ci continuum can explain the data :    * magnetic dust is discarded on morphological grounds .",
    "the expected 31  ghz intensity from a magnetic enhancement of the grain opacity is at odds with the cbi data .",
    "the polarization levels required by magnetic dust are not observed .",
    "* spinning dust can account for the radio spectrum .",
    "but the predicted levels in s  1 are in excess by a factor @xmath5640 at 3  @xmath23 .",
    "we take the intensities in pah  11.3  @xmath19 m as a proxy for the mid - ir vsg emission , which is approximately proportional to both the vsg column and local uv intensity @xmath57 . taking into account the range of spinning dust emissivities in all possible environments , the uncertainties in our 31  ghz map",
    "can marginally reconcile spinning dust with the data ( i.e. at 3  @xmath23 variations ) .",
    "* alternatively a cold plasma such as that found in cii regions could explain the 31  ghz emission .",
    "the star hd147889 , a binary pre - main - sequence star with spectral types b2iv , b3iv , emits sufficient c - ionising uv radiation to interpret @xmath0  oph  w as a cii region . but the absence of detectable @xmath58ghz signal requires optically thick emission , and hence high h - nucleus densities ( @xmath8  @xmath4 , almost a factor of 10 higher than inferred in the literature ) , implying a hitherto unobserved molecular phase of the ism . in @xmath0",
    "oph this molecular phase takes the form of an ensemble of dense clumps or sheets at temperatures of order 50  k or less .",
    "the cold plasma interpretation explains the 2mass - cbi correlation through an important fluorescent h@xmath35 contribution to the 2mass bands .",
