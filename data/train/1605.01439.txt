    "galaxy clusters in the early universe provide key clues to the relation between structure formation and galaxy evolution . in the local universe ,",
    "galaxy clusters are located in the densest peaks of the dark matter distribution at the intersections of filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their galaxies have significantly different properties from field galaxies as evidenced by the morphology - density relation and the cluster red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this way , cluster formation is closely linked to the large - scale structure and environmental effects on galaxy properties .",
    "the direct observation of protoclusters , which are overdense regions of galaxies in the high - redshift universe , will provide us clues to how these relations are formed .    in the local universe ,",
    "clusters contain a large number of passive galaxies , but the fraction of star - forming galaxies in clusters is gradually increasing with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . around @xmath14",
    ", some studies reported that galaxies in high - density environments form stars more actively than those in low - density environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . beyond @xmath15 , young and star - forming galaxies",
    "appear to be a dominant galaxy population even in the most overdense regions .",
    "these protoclusters are often identified by using lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) or ly@xmath11 emitters ( laes ) , which enable us to trace large - scale structures at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the highest - redshift protocluster discovered to date is at @xmath16 @xcite , and is composed of at least ten galaxies @xcite .",
    "some candidates without spectroscopic confirmation beyond @xmath17 have also been found @xcite .",
    "although the majority of protocluster members are young and star - forming galaxies , a red sequence , composed of bright and red galaxies , is found to appear in protoclusters around @xmath18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these color differences between protocluster and field galaxies is the result of different galaxy properties , such as age , dust , or metallicity .",
    "for example , stellar mass is a basic and readily observable property that can be used to determine details of the star - formation history ; protocluster galaxies appear to have higher stellar masses than their field counterparts at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite reported that star formation rate ( sfr ) is similar between protocluster and field galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "these results suggest that the differences in stellar mass at @xmath18 between protocluster and field galaxies may be attributed to differences in star - formation duration or the formation epoch . besides ordinary galaxies , very rare objects , such as ly@xmath11 blobs ,",
    "submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , are also frequently discovered in high - density environments @xcite .",
    "some contradictory results in the mass - metallicity relation have been revealed among protoclusters at the same redshift @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have found a large amount of cold gas surrounding a @xmath19 protocluster , which may serve as the reservoir for significant future star formation .",
    "as described above , some distinguishing features have been identified in each protocluster by comparing with field galaxies , but the still relatively small number of protoclusters known ( see the overview table in @xcite ) makes it difficult to determine which are common features .",
    "in addition to the sample size , it should be noted that many previous studies used radio galaxies ( rgs ) or quasars ( qsos ) as probes of protoclusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because the host galaxies of these objects are thought to be embedded in massive dark matter halos .",
    "@xcite showed that rgs tend to reside in high - density environments ; on the other hand , protoclusters are also found in the regions without rgs or qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . despite the efficiency of searching for protoclusters around rg or qso fields ,",
    "biased protoclusters might be selected because strong radiation from rgs and qsos may provide negative feedback and suppress nearby galaxy formation , especially for low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the mechanisms triggering agn activity may not be present in all overdense environments and , given that agn activity is a transient phenomenon with , in some cases , relatively short timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is likely that many protoclusters are missed when using such objects as beacons .",
    "in addition to rgs and qsos , smgs have been used as similar probes of overdensities at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , only cursory systematic studies of such objects have been performed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) finding that smgs have a complicated relationship with environment , and , indeed , simulations appear to underscore the complexity of this relationship @xcite .",
    "therefore it is preferable , for any systematic study of such environments , to use a population that minimizes such biases and complexities .",
    "this would allow us to address cluster formation and environmental effects on galaxy evolution based on systematic and less biased samples of protoclusters .    here",
    ", we present a systematic survey of protoclusters at @xmath20 based on wide - field imaging and follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "this is a complementary approach to protocluster research compared with previous surveys targeting rg / qso fields using a relatively small field of view ( fov ) .",
    "this survey was performed using the wide ( @xmath21 ) canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) deep fields , whose depth and area are more adequate to measuring the overdensity of high - redshift galaxies to identify distant protoclusters than the cfhtls wide fields . although our protocluster candidates were detected by using a less biased method , our method still relies on the presence of ly@xmath11 emission , which will bring another potential bias , in confirming the protocluster members by spectroscopy .",
    "section [ sec : phot ] describes the imaging data and the @xmath1 dropout galaxy sample used in this study . in section [ sec : over ] , we quantify overdensity based on the sky distribution of @xmath1 galaxies , and select the best protocluster candidates by comparing the most overdense regions with expectations from a cosmological simulation . the configuration and results of our follow - up spectroscopy are shown in section [ sec : spec ] . in section [ sec : discuss ] , we discuss the structure and properties of confirmed protoclusters and compare with those of field galaxies .",
    "the conclusions are given in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters : @xmath22 , and magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we made use of publicly available data from the cfhtls ( t0007 : * ? ? ? * ) , which was obtained with megacam mounted at the prime focus of the cfht .",
    "the deep fields of the cfhtls were used in this study , which consist of four independent fields of about @xmath23 area each ( @xmath21 area in total ) observed in the @xmath24- , @xmath25- , @xmath26- , @xmath27- , and @xmath28-bands .",
    "the field center and limiting magnitudes of each field are summarized in table [ tab : photo ] . the seeing size ( fwhm ) and pixel scale of all the images are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "although data at other wavelengths , such as near- or mid - infrared imaging , are available in a part of the cfhtls deep fields , the depth and coverage are significantly different from field to field . therefore , our protocluster search is conducted only based on the optical data to make an uniform survey .",

    ", we used the iraf task mkobjects to create artificial objects on the original images .",
    "artificial objects , which were given a gaussian profile with a fwhm the same as the seeing size , were randomly distributed on the real image outside of twice the fwhm of the real objects to avoid blending artificial objects with real objects .",
    "we generated 50,000 artificial objects in the @xmath40 range , and extracted them using sextractor with the same parameter set .",
    "this procedure was repeated ten times , and the detection completeness was 7050% at the @xmath39 limiting magnitudes of @xmath27- and @xmath28-bands in each field . at fainter than @xmath39 limiting magnitude , the detection completeness drops sharply to @xmath41 .",
    "we confirmed that the results of our completeness tests are consistent with the values described in the cfhtls data release ( we find @xmath42 completeness at the same magnitude at which @xmath43 is expected ) .",
    "it should be noted that detection completeness at bright magnitudes depends on blending with neighbor objects and we carefully masked out bright objects .",
    "we selected @xmath44 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique ( @xmath45- , @xmath46- , @xmath47- , and @xmath48-dropout galaxies ) .",
    "the @xmath27-band detection catalog was used for the selection of @xmath45- , @xmath46- , and @xmath47-dropout galaxies , and @xmath48-dropout galaxies were selected from the @xmath28-band detection catalog , based on the following color selection criteria @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a @xmath51 limiting magnitude . in redder bands than lyman break ( e.g. @xmath25- and @xmath26-bands for @xmath45-dropout galaxies ) , we only used objects detected with more than @xmath51 significance in order to accurately estimate their color ; on the other hand , @xmath51 limiting magnitude was used as color limit if objects were detected less than @xmath51 significance in bluer bands ( e.g. @xmath24-band for @xmath45-dropout galaxies ) .",
    "the results do not significantly change even if we use 1 or @xmath39 significance as the limiting magnitude .",
    "we estimated the redshift distribution resulting from these criteria by using the population synthesis model code galaxev @xcite and the absorption of intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "in galaxev , we simulated a large variety of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using the padova 1994 simple stellar population model .",
    "we assumed a @xcite initial mass function with lower and upper mass cutoffs @xmath52 and @xmath53 , two metallicities ( 0.2 and 0.02 @xmath54 ) , and two star formation histories ( sfhs ) of constant and instantaneous star formation .",
    "we extracted model spectra with ages between @xmath55 and the age of the universe at that redshift and applied the reddening law of @xcite with @xmath56 between 0.00 and 1.50 .",
    "the model magnitudes were estimated by convolving these simulated seds with the filter transmission curves .",
    "we then added the photometric noise , which is typically @xmath57 and @xmath58 at the @xmath59 and @xmath39 limiting magnitudes , respectively . in this process , we assumed that the magnitude distribution of the simulated galaxies and the observed dropout galaxies were the same .",
    "then , the redshift distributions of the @xmath45- , @xmath46- , @xmath47- , and @xmath48-dropout galaxies are estimated by applying the same color selection criteria of dropout galaxies to these simulated seds ( figure [ fig : select ] ) .",
    "the expected redshift ranges of the dropout selection are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for @xmath45- , @xmath46- , @xmath47- , and @xmath48-dropout galaxies , respectively .",
    "it should be pointed out that these estimates rely on some assumptions ( e.g. , the model of igm absorption , sfh ) .",
    "although we used the igm model of @xcite , other models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that igm absorption can vary significantly among different lines of sight , but there is a degeneracy between igm absorption and dust extinction .",
    "however , as long as the properties of the galaxies in overdense regions and in the field are not too different , both populations will be affected in the same manner , implying that we can still search for relative overdensities as a tracer of protoclusters .",
    "the numbers of selected dropout galaxies detected in each field are shown in table [ tab : photo ] .",
    "note that the limiting magnitude of this study corresponds to about @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ( where @xmath67 is the characteristic magnitude of the schechter functions fitted the dropout galaxies at each redshift ) for @xmath45- , @xmath46- , @xmath47- , and @xmath48-dropout galaxies , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the survey depth reaches at least the typical brightness of dropout galaxies even for @xmath48-dropout galaxies .",
    "we evaluated the contamination rate for these color - selection criteria by comparing the dropout selection regions with the positions of contamination on two - color diagram ( figure [ fig : demo ] ) .",
    "the major sources of the contamination are dwarf stars and old elliptical galaxies , the latter being possible to satisfy the color criteria due to the 4000 / balmer break .",
    "to estimate the contamination rate of dwarf stars , we use the trilegal code @xcite , which can simulate number count and broad - band photometry of stars in any galaxy field .",
    "since this model enables us to set up various structural parameters of thin disc , thick disc , halo , and bulge , we used an exponential disk model with default values of scale length and height , and a chabrier imf was applied .",
    "the galactic latitudes were set to be the same as those of the observations ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "then , photometry of the simulated dwarf stars was calculated for the cfht / megacam s filter set .",
    "next , we simulated old galaxy seds using the galaxev , assuming two relatively high metallicities ( @xmath54 and @xmath69 ) , and extracted model spectra with ages of @xmath70 .",
    "the redshift tracks of old galaxies are away from all dropout selection regions . and , although a few dwarf stars are located only within the @xmath47- and @xmath48-dropout selection regions , the main locus of dwarf stars lie far from these regions . actually , the contamination rate of dwarf stars in the @xmath47-dropout samples is expected to be @xmath71 depending on the galactic latitude , and the contamination rate in @xmath48-dropout samples is @xmath72 in the cfhtls deep fields . based on these simulations of dwarf stars and old galaxies , the dropout selection criteria used in this study",
    "are confirmed to be able to separate high - redshift galaxies from contaminations .",
    "we have estimated the local surface number density by counting the number of dropout galaxies within a fixed aperture in order to determine the overdensity significance quantitatively .",
    "@xcite presented a useful definition of the characteristic radius of protoclusters based on cosmological simulations , which encloses 65% of the mass , based on a combination of @xmath73-body dark matter simulations and semi - analytical galaxy formation models . although their result was based on the three - dimensional distribution of protocluster galaxies , it is still useful guide for constructing a map of the projected local surface number density when searching for protoclusters . according to the characteristic radius of protoclusters having a descendant halo mass of @xmath74 at @xmath5 ,",
    "the radius of @xmath75 was used for @xmath45- , @xmath46- , and @xmath47-dropout galaxies , which corresponds to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "although the characteristic radius is expected to be larger for protoclusters having more massive descendant masses , these still show a clear overdensity even on @xmath75 scales ; thus , the aperture size of @xmath75 should be effective to find protoclusters with a descendant halo mass of @xmath79 .",
    "however , we still have to consider the projection effects resulting from the large redshift uncertainty of our dropout selection .",
    "we discuss the effectiveness of our protocluster search more quantitatively by using a theoretical model in the following subsection .",
    "it should be noted that protoclusters have a nearly constant physical size at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we used a slightly larger radius of @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) for @xmath48-dropout galaxies in order to reduce the large poisson error resulting from a too small aperture .",
    "the apertures were distributed over the cfhtls deep fields in a grid pattern at intervals of @xmath82 .",
    "we measured the mean and the dispersion , @xmath83 , of the number of galaxies in an aperture over the field . the surface number density in masked regions",
    "was assumed to be the same as the mean surface number density .",
    "apertures in which more than @xmath84 area is masked are not used in the following analysis . using the mean and @xmath83 of the number of dropout galaxies in an aperture , surface number density contours of @xmath45- , @xmath46- , @xmath47- , and",
    "@xmath48-dropout galaxies were calculated and are plotted in figures [ fig : cntr_udrop ] , [ fig : cntr_gdrop ] , [ fig : cntr_rdrop ] , and [ fig : cntr_idrop ] , respectively .",
    "we note that this is the same procedure that was applied to the @xmath48-dropout galaxies in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) to draw their surface number density contour , which led to the discovery of the protocluster at @xmath16 from @xcite . in order to study the effects of incompleteness",
    ", we performed the same overdensity measurement but for @xmath45- , @xmath46- , and @xmath47-dropout galaxies brighter than @xmath85 in @xmath27-band ( for @xmath48-dropout galaxies , it is hard to select a brighter subset due to the small sample size ) . from this analysis , we confirmed that the change of limiting magnitude does not have a significant effect on our protocluster selection .",
    "although we can clearly see some overdense regions in the sky distribution maps presented in figures [ fig : cntr_udrop ] , [ fig : cntr_gdrop ] , [ fig : cntr_rdrop ] , and [ fig : cntr_idrop ] , it is not straightforward to find plausible protocluster candidates since the large redshift uncertainty of dropout technique , which is @xmath86 ( @xmath87 at @xmath88 ) , hampers the identification of clustering structure in three - dimensional space . on one hand , overdensities associated with real protoclusters could be weakened by fore / background galaxies ; on the other hand , chance alignments of the large - scale structure or superpositions of filaments could erroneously enhance the surface overdensity .",
    "therefore , we will make use of predictions from simulations to understand the relation between surface overdensity significance and the probability of finding real protoclusters .    to this end",
    ", we used a set of light - cone models constructed by @xcite .",
    "a brief outline of the light - cone models is presented below .",
    "first , the assembly history of the dark matter halos was traced using an @xmath73-body simulation @xcite , in which the length of the simulation box was @xmath89 and the particle mass was @xmath90 .",
    "the distributions of dark matter halos were stored at discrete epochs .",
    "next , the processes of baryonic physics were added to dark matter halos at each epoch using a semi - analytic galaxy formation model @xcite . based on the intrinsic parameters of galaxies predicted by the semi - analytic model , such as stellar mass , star formation history , metallicity , and dust content ,",
    "the photometric properties of simulated galaxies were estimated from the stellar population synthesis models developed by @xcite .",
    "then , these simulated galaxies in boxes at different epochs were projected along the line - of - sight , and intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption was applied @xcite in order to mimic a pencil - beam survey as described in @xcite .",
    "finally , 24 light - cone models with @xmath91 fov were extracted using these procedures .",

    "despite our calibration of the selection of the protocluster candidates using light - cone projections described in the previous section , the overdense regions discovered could still be attributed to mere chance of alignments along the line - of - sight , given that the dropout technique samples a broad range of redshifts .",
    "another possibility is that the overdense significance could be affected by the presence of highly clustered contaminating populations .",
    "this possibility is negligible for the @xmath45- , @xmath46- , and @xmath47-dropout samples because of their high number density .",
    "however , for the @xmath48-dropout galaxies , the average number density per aperture is only 1.6 due to the shallow @xmath28-band depth . since the contamination rate of @xmath48-dropout galaxies is @xmath110 ( section [ sec : select ] ) , the number of contaminants in an aperture is @xmath114 on average , which could result in an overdensity @xmath115 higher at worst .",

    "therefore , we investigated the possibility that h@xmath11 and [ ] emission lines contaminate dropout galaxy samples based on both imaging and spectroscopic data .",
    "only @xmath47- and @xmath48-dropout galaxies can be contaminated by h@xmath11 emitting galaxies according to its wavelength ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "since higher - redshift dropout galaxies are selected using a redder color criterion to detect the strong lyman break , it is almost impossible to mimic this color by a balmer break object at lower redshift based on the expected color of passive galaxies as described in section [ sec : select ] .",

    "on the other hand , dusty starburst galaxies with strong balmer breaks could be contaminated because they would show an h@xmath11 emission line as well as a very red color , resulting from the combination of balmer break and dust reddening .",
    "however , their h@xmath11 emissions can be discriminated from ly@xmath11 emissions , which appear right at the lyman break .",
    "therefore , we consider the possibility of finding foreground h@xmath11 emission negligible .    regarding [ ] doublet emission lines , it is possible to distinguish between ly@xmath11 and [ ] emission lines based on the line profile .",
    "the spectral resolution of most of our spectroscopic observation was set high enough to resolve [ ] emission lines as doublets ( @xmath149 at @xmath150 ) , although it would be practically difficult to resolve these in most cases due to low s / n .",
    "in this case , the [ ] emission line is typically skewed blueward , while the ly@xmath11 emission line from high redshift galaxies is skewed redward .",
    "therefore , the skewness of the line profile allows us to distinguish between ly@xmath11 and [ ] emission lines ; however , it should be noted that [ oii ] emission is sometimes skewed redward when assuming an exotic physical properties of region ( e.g. , election density ) . to improve the way of distinguishing",
    ", @xcite introduced `` weighted '' skewness , which makes use of line width as well as line profile .",
    "ly@xmath11 emission usually has a larger line width than [ ] emission because ly@xmath11 emission typically emerges in an outflow or galactic wind .",
    "therefore , we calculated the weighted skewness of all spectroscopically detected galaxies .",
    "the asymmetric emission lines with @xmath151 are clear evidence of ly@xmath11 emission from high redshift galaxies , though it would be more difficult to distinguish them from nearby emission line galaxies at @xmath112 , where the igm attenuation is weaker than at higher redshifts . as shown in table [",
    "tab : spec_all ] , most of the emission lines of this study have large @xmath152 .",
    "however , 17% of all identified emission lines have @xmath153 ; although this would be caused by strong sky line residuals and low s / n data , we could not rule out the possibility of [ ] emission lines . in order to make the line profile measurement more accurate by reducing the effect of sky noise and low s / n data",
    ", we made a composite spectrum of all 24 emission lines with @xmath153 by taking a median in the rest - frame , assuming they were ly@xmath11 , and normalized by the peak flux .",
    "the weighted skewness of the composite spectrum was found to be @xmath154 , indicating that most of the emission lines even with @xmath153 in individual spectra are real ly@xmath11 emission lines from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in addition to the line profile , the possibility of [ ] emission can further be reduced by taking account of photometric data .",
    "although [ ] emission is closer to balmer break than h@xmath11 emission , it will still be difficult to find a sharp break near the emission line except for peculiar galaxies such as dusty starburst galaxies .    from these considerations ,",
    "it is unlikely that h@xmath11 or [ ] emission lines contaminate our dropout samples , and ly@xmath11 is the most plausible interpretation to explain both photometric and spectral features . since the major contamination in the photometric selection is completely different from that in the spectroscopic observation , the combination of photometric and spectroscopic observations enables us to select a clean sample of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we can regard all single emission lines detected from our dropout sample as ly@xmath11 emission lines .",
    "our protocluster confirmation completely depends on the detection of ly@xmath11 emission ; therefore , we might only select a part of the galaxy populations in these protoclusters .",
    "we might miss protoclusters , if they were mainly composed of passive or dusty galaxies without ly@xmath11 emission .",
    "this may lead to a possible selection bias in our protocluster search .",
    "however , protoclusters at @xmath18 have been found to mainly contain star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that known protoclusters that include a large number of older or dustier galaxies , like the ssa22 ( @xmath155 ) and the spider - web ( @xmath156 ) protoclusters , also show a significant overdensity in laes as well @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the possible bias introduced by tracing protoclusters only by laes is not probably significant .",
    "the number of dropout galaxies located in each protocluster candidate region is listed in table [ tab : target ] , and the number of spectroscopically observed galaxies is shown in table [ tab : cluster ] . from these numbers , about half , at least 35% , of dropout galaxies in protocluster candidate regions were observed by our follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "we carefully discriminated real emission lines from sky lines or noise by examining both two - dimensional and one - dimensional spectra , and all emission lines identified in this study are shown in figure [ fig : spec_all ] .",
    "we estimate the observed properties of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies , such as uv absolute magnitude at 1300 in the rest - frame ( @xmath157 ) , ly@xmath11 luminosity ( @xmath158 ) , and rest - frame ly@xmath11 equivalent width ( @xmath159 ) , shown in table [ tab : spec_all ] . the redshifts were derived by the peak wavelength of the ly@xmath11 emission line , assuming the rest wavelength of ly@xmath11 to be 1215.6 .",
    "these measurements could be overestimated if there was a galactic outflow .",
    "when emission lines are located near strong sky lines , the position of the peak could be shifted .",

@xmath48-dropout galaxies ) .",

    "the broad - band magnitude has a negligible dependence on uv slope , because the broad - band width is only @xmath1106 .",

    "the possibility to have two galaxies within @xmath1111 is 16% .",
    "although their distribution is more concentrated than homogeneous , these two galaxies are unlikely to merge into a single halo by @xmath5 based on our analysis of the possible separations of protocluster galaxies at @xmath13 ( figure [ fig:3d_model ] ) . for now , we can not conclude that there is a real protocluster in the d1id01 region due to the small number of statistics .      as for the d3id01 region , eight @xmath48-dropout galaxies",
    "were observed out of sixteen candidates .",
    "the completeness of our spectroscopic observation is smaller ( @xmath1112 ) than for the d1id01 region , which has less protocluster member candidates .",
    "many faint @xmath48-dropout galaxies are still to be observed because we assigned the brighter @xmath48-dropout galaxies higher priorities .",

    "the sky distribution of the targets is shown in figure [ fig : spec_obs_d3i ] .",

    "these two galaxies have almost the same redshift with the difference of @xmath1113 ( @xmath1114 in physical scale ) .",
    "the possibility that two galaxies have this small redshift separation is only 1.2% , and these two galaxies can certainly be expected to be in the same halo at @xmath5 based on this small separation .",
    "while we could not make a clear conclusion due to the small number of confirmed galaxies , the discovery of a close galaxy - pair at @xmath13 could imply the existence of a protocluster .",
    "interestingly , @xcite have found that galaxies tend to be in close pairs in another protocluster at @xmath16 .",
    "the relatively small number of confirmed candidate can be attributed to the observational limit since our spectroscopic samples are biased to brighter galaxies ( @xmath1115 ) .",
    "we compared the d3id01 protocluster candidate with the @xmath16 protocluster in the sdf @xcite , which was also identified by the combination of dropout selection and follow - up spectroscopy targeting ly@xmath11 emission like this study . applying the same magnitude limit of @xmath1115 to the sdf protocluster ,",
    "the number of remaining protocluster members was only two our of a total of ten .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reported the discovery of two protoclusters at @xmath1116 .",

    "therefore , it is not unreasonable to expect only two confirmed member galaxies in this study even if there is a real protocluster .      we have spectroscopically observed fifteen @xmath47-dropout galaxies in the d1rd01 region , and detected single emission lines from six galaxies .",
    "the sky distribution of the observed galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : spec_obs_d1r ] . in the @xmath1118 overdense region",

    "however , it is unclear whether this galaxy pair will grow into a cluster at @xmath5 due to the small number of confirmed galaxies ; at least , these two galaxies are expected to merge into a single halo .",
    "since there are many spectroscopically unobserved galaxies , further follow - up observation will enable to clarify whether there is a protocluster or not .",
    "in the d4rd02 region , the total integration time of follow - up spectroscopic observation was only two hours , which was half of that in the d1rd01 region .",
    "thus , although twelve @xmath47-dropout galaxies were observed , ly@xmath11 emission lines were detected from only three galaxies .",
    "the sky distribution of the observed galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : spec_obs_d4r ] .",
    "these three galaxies are largely separated in redshift space .",
    "since about 20 @xmath47-dropout galaxies remain to be spectroscopically observed , further follow - up observation will be necessary to make a conclusion .      combining the deimos and focas follow - up observations , 123 @xmath46-dropout galaxies were observed , and the redshifts of 36 galaxies were determined by detecting ly@xmath11 emission lines . the sky distribution of the observed galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : spec_obs_d1 g ] .",
    "figure [ fig : redshift_d1 g ] shows the redshift distribution of confirmed galaxies .",
    "although galaxies seem to be clustering at @xmath1128 , these galaxies are spread over a large projected area , as shown in figure [ fig : spec_obs_d1 g ] . since the deimos has a wide fov ( @xmath1129 ) , which is larger than the area of the d1gd01 region , some @xmath46-dropout galaxies outside the overdense region",
    "were also observed .",
    "when we focus only on galaxies in the overdense region , shown by the red - line histogram in figure [ fig : redshift_d1 g ] , the peak around @xmath1130 becomes lower and only three galaxies are clustering within the expected redshift range of the protocluster candidate ( @xmath1131 ) .",
    "given the total number of confirmed galaxies in the overdense region , the group of three galaxies can be reproduced even from a random homogeneous distribution with a probability of 21% .",
    "based on this probability , it can not be dismissed that the observed redshift distribution is drawn from a uniform random distribution .",
    "hence , we can not currently conclude that there is a protocluster in the d1gd01 region without further observations .",
    "hereafter , we regard the d1gd01 region as not being a protocluster .",
    "the high surface overdensity observed in this field could be attributed to a coincidental alignment of large - scale structure on a scale of @xmath1132 , which is too large to grow into a single halo by @xmath5 .      combining the deimos and focas follow - up observations ,",
    "144 @xmath46-dropout galaxies were spectroscopically observed in the d4gd01 protocluster region , and the redshifts of 42 galaxies were determined by detecting ly@xmath11 emission lines .",

    "it should also be noted that an agn was found in this region at @xmath1136 by our spectroscopy as shown in figure [ fig : spec_obs_d4 g ] .",
    "the redshift was derived to be @xmath1137 based on its heii and ciii ] emission lines ( figure [ fig : spec_d4g_agn ] ) . according to this estimate , the redshift separation between the agn and the center of the protocluster is @xmath1138 , which corresponds to the radial distance of @xmath1139 .",
    "as the redshift separation is too large , it is unlikely that this agn is a part of the protocluster members that will merge into a single halo by @xmath5 .",

    "there is a excess at @xmath1140 , including five galaxies within @xmath1141 .",
    "the probability to reproduce this excess by drawing from a uniform random distribution of 30 galaxies is only 0.9% ; thus , the five galaxies were found to be significantly clustered though the absolute excess is only five .",
    "the spatial and redshift separations among these five galaxies are small enough to merge into a single halo by @xmath5 compared with the model prediction ; therefore we confirmed a protocluster at @xmath1140 , which includes five member galaxies ( id=6 - 10 ) .",

    "these five galaxies are expected to merge into a single halo by @xmath5 compared with the model prediction .",
    "therefore , we confirmed a protocluster at @xmath1142 , which includes five member galaxies ( id=7 - 11 ) .      based on these follow - up spectroscopic observations , we were able to confirm three protoclusters in the d4gd01 , d1ud01 , and d4ud01 regions .",
    "we could not confirm that the overdensity observed in the d1gd01 region is indeed a protocluster .",
    "thus , at least , the success rate of our protocluster search is found to be 3/4 at @xmath0 , which is consistent with that of the model prediction ( @xmath1143 of @xmath2 overdense regions are expected to be real protoclusters ) . as for @xmath47- and @xmath48-dropout protocluster candidates , it is unclear whether they are real protoclusters or not because of the small number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies , though the d3id01 and d1rd01 regions include close galaxy pairs , which could indicate the existence of protoclusters .",
    "these results suggest that most of the other protocluster candidates will turn out to be genuine protoclusters once sufficient follow - up spectroscopic observations are performed . the summary of our protocluster confirmation is described in table [ tab : cluster ] .",
    "these findings do not only increase the number of known protocluster at high redshift , but provide us with samples that are complementary to previous works in which protoclusters were mainly discovered in qso or rg regions .",
    "although we discovered one agn in an overdense region by our spectroscopy , it was not associated with any protocluster . the precise relation between protoclusters and agns merits future investigation .",
    "the radial velocity dispersions of the confirmed protoclusters were calculated by the redshifts of protocluster members assuming that the redshifts probe line - of - sight velocity . to calculate dispersion",
    ", we used the biweight variance @xcite , which is an effective method even with a small sample .",
    "since our follow - up spectroscopy is not complete , the effect of small number statistics should be taken into account in the uncertainty of the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "the uncertainty of radial velocity dispersion was measured by the combination of the velocity error of our spectroscopic observations and the standard deviation of the measurements by bootstrap sampling the protocluster members .",
    "in addition to the optical imaging and our spectroscopy , rich multi - wavelength data is available in part of the cfhtls deep fields .",
    "although this enables us to make further analysis , such as sed fitting , to derive galaxy properties in more detail , these studies will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "the d4gd01 protocluster , of which we confirmed eleven protocluster members , is the most extensively mapped protoclusters among the three confirmed systems described in section [ sec : spec ] .",
    "thus , we focus on this protocluster in the following discussion of the internal structure of the protocluster and the properties of its galaxies .",
    "we investigated the three - dimensional distribution of protocluster galaxies in the d4gd01 region , as shown in figure [ fig:3d ] . in this analysis ,",
    "the distances are simply estimated from the measured redshift , including any possible peculiar velocity component .",
    "however , we have checked that this does not significantly affect our estimates given the typical size of protoclusters . by @xmath5 , are still embedded in individual host halos at @xmath1144 , and their clustering is not probably strong enough to provoke a large peculiar velocity field .",
    "therefore , we expect that their real three - dimensional distribution at some level can be determined by using their redshifts as proxies for their relative line of sight distances . according to the theoretical model of @xcite ,",
    "the deviation of the difference between apparent and geometrical redshift is @xmath1145 , shown by black scale in figure [ fig:3d ] .",
    "] this protocluster seems to have a region where galaxies are strongly concentrated , reminiscent of a cluster core . to discuss the internal structure quantitatively , we calculated the spatial separation of galaxies with respect to the @xmath73th nearest neighbor . in figure",
    "[ fig : dnth ] , the distributions of the separation from the 1st to 6th nearest galaxies of individual protocluster galaxies are shown , and the red - line histograms indicate the expected distribution if eleven galaxies are randomly located inside the protocluster . the distribution of protocluster galaxies from the 3rd to 5th nearest are significantly different from the random distribution , whose significances are @xmath1146 based on the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ; especially , the significance of 5th nearest is less than 0.01 .",
    "in contrast , there are no significant differences in the distribution of 6th or higher nearest galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that the protocluster has a subgroup consisting of six galaxies ; therefore , the subgroup can not be seen in the distribution of the 6th or higher nearest galaxies , which are consistent with the random distribution .",
    "the six galaxies constituting the subgroup are defined by having shorter separation than @xmath80 from the 5th nearest galaxies ( id=11 - 16 ) .",
    "the distributions of 1st and 2nd nearest galaxies could also be divided into two groups of shorter and longer separations though they are not so significant ( @xmath1147 ) due to focusing on too small scale .",
    "these six galaxies are indicated by red points in figure [ fig:3d ] , and are located near the center of the protocluster .",
    "there are several galaxies in the region surrounding the core , which could assemble into the core to form a rich cluster .",
    "this is in clear contrast that we saw in the protocluster at @xmath13 , which was found to have several small subgroups , like galaxy pairs @xcite .",
    "although we have only one protocluster at each redshift , if they are the progenitor and descendant of each other , the transformation of protocluster internal structure from @xmath13 to @xmath12 may be indicative of the virializing process over cosmic time , whereby protoclusters dynamically evolve into a more and more concentrated structure . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the virializing process would not be completed yet though there are richer protoclusters where some massive and passive galaxies have already appeared .",
    "the internal structures of some protoclusters have been more closely investigated using extensive spectroscopy , and some protoclusters were found to have significant substructure @xcite .",
    "therefore , even at the same redshift , protoclusters could have a large variety of internal structure . in this study based on a small number of protoclusters , the difference of internal structure found in the @xmath13 and @xmath12 protoclusters",
    "are assumed to be resulted from the evolutionary phase of the representative protoclusters .",
    "however , larger samples at each redshift will be required to statistically match progenitors and descendants , allowing us to study cluster formation over cosmic time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we compared several galaxy properties between protocluster members and coeval field galaxies to investigate whether there are any differences due to their environment .",
    "the d4gd01 protocluster consists of eleven members , while the number of field @xmath46-dropout galaxies available is 67 by combining the galaxies in the d1 and d4 fields .",
    "the protocluster and field galaxies were identified by the same imaging and spectroscopic observations ; thus , some sample bias , if any , would affect both samples in the same way .",
    "this should allow us to make a fair comparison between protocluster and field galaxies .",
    "the average of @xmath158 , @xmath157 , and @xmath159 are described in table [ tab : ave_d4 g ] .",
    "since the d4gd01 protocluster has a core - like substructure as mentioned in section [ sec : struc ] , the eleven members were divided into two groups of six galaxies in the core and five galaxies in the outskirt .",
    "table [ tab : ave_d4 g ] also shows the average properties of these two subgroups . in figure",
    "[ fig : m - ew ] , the properties of individual protocluster and field galaxies are plotted on the @xmath157 and @xmath159 diagram .",
    "we found that protocluster galaxies have significantly smaller @xmath159 or @xmath158 luminosity than field galaxies ( ks p - value is @xmath1148 ) ; especially , fainter protocluster members in @xmath157 are strongly suppressed in their ly@xmath11 emissions compared with field galaxies .",

    "it is therefore interesting that we are finding a difference in the @xmath159 or @xmath158 distributions between field and protocluster in the d4gd01 system at @xmath8 .",
    "this is perhaps an indication that the situation is changing around @xmath12 .",
    "one simple mechanism that could reduce the ly@xmath11 @xmath159 would be dust , which traps ly@xmath11 photons .",
    "if dust is a major reason for the small @xmath159 , @xmath157 is expected to be systematically smaller in the protocluster because uv flux can also be easily attenuated by dust as in the case with ly@xmath11 emission . however , we did not find any systematic difference in @xmath157 between the protocluster and field galaxies ( see table [ tab : ave_d4 g ] ) .",
    "although dust attenuation does not seems to be the reason for this result , it is still possible that the amount of uv flux attenuated by dust is being compensated by higher sfr or other effects related to uv emission ; in that case , we would not find any difference in the distribution of apparent @xmath157 between protocluster and field galaxies even if there were to be a clear difference of dust attenuation .",
    "therefore , in order to more directly estimate the dust attenuation , we compared the uv slope between protocluster and field galaxies .",
    "the uv slope of each @xmath46-dropout galaxy was determined from the @xmath1162 color . however , since the @xmath27-band image was significantly deeper ( @xmath1163 ) than the @xmath28-band image , some @xmath46-dropout galaxies were not detected in the @xmath28-band . for the estimate of the uv slope ,",
    "we therefore only used @xmath46-dropout galaxies which were detected in the @xmath28-band image with @xmath1164 significance ( @xmath1165 ) .",
    "although this discordant depth between the @xmath27- and @xmath28-band images will lead to a bias in the estimate of uv slope , the protocluster and field galaxies would be equally biased as they were selected by the same criteria and from the same dataset .",
    "the numbers of @xmath46-dropout galaxies used in the estimate was nine for the protocluster and 50 for the field .",
    "note that there is no difference in the fraction of galaxies detected in @xmath28-band between protocluster ( 9/11 ) and field ( 50/67 ) .",
    "the uv slope was calculated from @xmath1166 where @xmath1167 is the effective wavelength .",
    "the average @xmath142 of the protocluster galaxies was @xmath1168 , and that of the field galaxies was @xmath1169 ; thus , it would be hard to explain the difference in @xmath159 simply by dust attenuation .",
    "it should be noted that , the radiative process of ly@xmath11 photon to escape from a galaxy is very complicated affected by many other quantities , such as dust geometry , gas kinematics , and outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "neutral hydrogen gas within a protocluster is another possible reason for the small @xmath159 .",
    "@xcite found a large amount of neutral hydrogen gas ( @xmath1170 ) in the intracluster space of a protocluster by examining spectra of background galaxies of a protocluster at @xmath19 that showed absorption at the same wavelength as the observed ly@xmath11 of the protocluster .",
    "if the same is true in the d4gd01 protocluster , though our follow - up spectroscopy is not deep enough to check this even by stacking , a small @xmath159 could be explained as a result of resonant scattering by the intracluster neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "while the uv photons can penetrate neutral hydrogen gas , ly@xmath11 emission is scattered and diffused , consistent with our results .",
    "suppose that a nearly mature protocluster , such as the d4gd01 protocluster , had already accumulated significant cold intracluster gas at @xmath8 ; the intracluster gas would come either from the outside of the protocluster drawn in by the strong gravitational potential of the protocluster , or could be brought in with the evolved member galaxies themselves through in- and outflows .",
    "although it is difficult to identify the cause , we have found that the average @xmath159 of @xmath8 protocluster members is significantly smaller than that of field galaxies .",

    "a strong correlation between the overdensity at high redshifts and the descendant halo mass at @xmath5 was found , and @xmath1143 of the overdense regions with significance over @xmath2 are expected to grow to dark matter halos with @xmath1173 at @xmath5 . despite significant projection effects , the model predicts that protoclusters can be identified with high confidence by measuring the surface overdensity significance .",
    "in addition , the model predicts that protocluster members are , on average , spread within a sphere of @xmath128 radius .",
    "we carried out follow - up spectroscopic observations of eight protocluster candidates between @xmath112 and @xmath13 to confirm whether these were genuine protoclusters .",
    "the redshifts of all the protocluster members were determined by detecting their ly@xmath11 emission lines , and no apparent contamination from low - redshift interlopers was found in our spectroscopic observation .",
    "although the completeness of slit allocation to dropout galaxies in a protocluster candidate is about @xmath1174 , three of the eight protocluster candidates were confirmed to be genuine protoclusters by ascertaining that their member galaxies were clustering both in spatial and redshift directions ( @xmath1175 ) with @xmath1176 significance with more than five members spectroscopically identified .",
    "spectroscopy revealed that chance alignment of dropout galaxies mimics an overdensity region for one candidate .",
    "there are some signatures of clustering of several galaxies in the other four protocluster candidates at @xmath7 ; however , the numbers of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies are still too small to conclude that they are genuine protoclusters .",

    "the d4gd01 protocluster galaxies have significantly smaller @xmath159 than coeval field galaxies , while there is no difference in @xmath157 .",
    "we considered two physical mechanisms that may lead to this difference ; the first is dust in protocluster galaxies , and the second is intracluster neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "although we were not able to draw definite conclusions based on current data , the uv slope was found not to favor an interpretation whereby the difference in @xmath159 is attributed only to dust .",
    "our finding of a smaller @xmath159 implies that the properties of protocluster galaxies might be affected by the environment already at @xmath8 .",
    "although we were successful in finding at least three new protoclusters using wide - field imaging and spectroscopy in a blank deep field , the sample size is still too small to elucidate a general picture of the structure formation and evolution of environmental effects .",
    "however , this study is an important benchmark for finding large numbers of protoclusters and tracing the cluster formation history in upcoming deep , wide surveys using identical techniques . using the new instrument hyper suprimecam ( hsc ) on the subaru telescope",
    ", we are performing an unprecedented wide and deep survey over the next four years .",
    "the hsc strategic survey consists of three layers : the wide layer covers @xmath1177 with the @xmath48-band depth of @xmath1178 , the deep layer @xmath1179 with @xmath1180 , and the ultradeep layer @xmath1181 with @xmath1182 . from this study",
    ", we estimate that the number of protoclusters , that the hsc survey will be able to find , will be @xmath1183 at @xmath7 and @xmath1184 at @xmath0 . from 2018",
    "onwards , spectroscopic follow - up of tens of thousands of dropout galaxies selected from the hsc deep layer will be performed using the large multiplexing capability of the prime focus spectrograph , also on the subaru telescope .",
    "this will allow us to understand the cluster formation process all the way from reionization to the present - day .",
    "the cfhtls data used in this study are based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / irfu , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council ( nrc ) of canada , the institut national des science de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii .",
    "this study is based in part on data products produced at terapix available at the canadian astronomy data centre as part of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey , a collaborative project of nrc and cnrs . and",

    "the subaru telescope is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "the w. m. keck telescope is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "the w. m. keck observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.m .",
    "keck foundation .",

    "we are grateful to the subaru , the w. m. keck , and gemini observatory staff for their help with the observations , and wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community . the millennium simulation databases used in this study and the web application providing online access to them were constructed as part of the activities of the german astrophysical virtual observatory ( gavo ) .",
