    "according to the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation , the dissipationless dark matter ( dm ) particles build up structures in the universe from small building blocks to create increasing more massive dm haloes . due to its ability to cool radiatively , the baryonic matter can loose pressure support and condense inside the dm haloes , forming the first luminous objects : stars , galaxies , and black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the formation of the first stars has been extensively studied in the last decade by a number of authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have shown that the first stars ( pop iii stars ) were formed due to molecular hydrogen cooling inside dm haloes of @xmath12 at redshift as high as @xmath13 .",
    "numerical simulations of the first stars were extended to the dm haloes in the mass range @xmath14 dm by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in order to study the physical processes involved in the formation of the first galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , individual pop iii stars ( or even clusters of hundreds of these stars ) are too faint to be detected even with current ( and future ) observations .",
    "the possibility that the _ james web space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) can observe the first galaxies , located in haloes @xmath15 times more massive than those hosting the first popiii stars , is an exciting motivation to study the so - called atomic cooling haloes ( i. e. dm haloes with a virial temperature @xmath16 ; hereafter achs",
    " see e.g. @xcite for a recent reviews ) .",
    "these types of haloes have been studied recently by @xcite and @xcite in the context of galactic disk formation with smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations .",
    "@xcite presented a low - resolution statistical study of haloes with masses above @xmath17 inside a highly biased over - dense region at @xmath0 , showing that every halo with mass above @xmath18 develops a gas disk structure .",
    "@xcite have studied the formation of a galactic disk inside a single @xmath19 halo using a high - resolution sph simulation at the same redshift . @xcite",
    "similarly studied the formation of two proto - galaxies in high - resolution amr simulations that also included star - formation and chemical and radiative feedback .",
    "protogalactic disk formation inside achs has been studied using analytical ( semi - phenomenological ) approaches as well . under the simple assumption @xcite that the disk specific angular momentum is a fixed fraction of the dm halo specific angular momentum",
    ", @xcite found that most haloes are able to form a stable disks ( the exceptions are haloes with very low spin parameter ) .",
    "@xcite extended the galactic disk study , taking into account the hierarchical nature of the structure formation . under the assumption of conservation of specific angular momentum during the collapse process they studied the effect of mergers on disk formation , concluding that mergers have a significant impact on the prevalence of disks .",
    "pristine achs have been proposed as possible sites for the formation of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "if the gas were able to remain at a temperature of @xmath20k in these haloes , it has been proposed that fragmentation may be avoided , allowing the formation of a @xmath21 supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the nucleus @xcite .",
    "these smbhs could then grow by another factor of @xmath22 by redshift @xmath23 and explain the puzzling presence of @xmath24 bhs by those redshifts ( see , e.g. , the recent review in @xcite ) .",
    "a few groups have now performed simulations of gas collapse in such haloes @xcite , with the simplifying assumption that @xmath2 cooling can be avoided , which may be feasible in case the haloes are illuminated by a strong lyman werner background @xcite .",
    "these works have indeed found no evidence of fragmentation .    in this paper",
    "we continue the study of achs using amr simulations .",
    "our work is motivated by the possible formation of galactic disks and smbhs inside these haloes , as well as by the fact that these haloes may host the first galaxies that will be directly detectable by _",
    "jwst_. our study is the largest in the literature based on hydrodynamical simulations , with a total of 19 haloes analysed at a spatial resolution of @xmath25 pc .",
    "we present , for the first time , a comprehensive study of gas and dm physical properties , including their spatial distribution , angular momenta , thermodynamical state , and turbulent properties .",
    "we go beyond commonly used diagnostic tools , such as spherically averaged profiles , and compute density and velocity power spectra , and density , velocity and temperature probability distribution functions . using our sample of haloes ,",
    "we attempt to identify the physical mechanisms that determine the angular momentum of the gas in the inner halo , and therefore whether a rotationally supported inner disk or a low - spin , compact dense cusp ( and ultimately a smbh ) forms .",
    "although we find essentially no correlation between the magnitude or direction of the angular momenta of the gas and the dm haloes , there are clear differences between the haloes hosting the two types of inner gas : haloes with low - spin central cusps form in highly biased regions at super - knots of the cosmic web , and have cooled their gas early on and undergone many mergers .",
    "this results in a lumpy and highly turbulent medium that could produce efficient transfer of angular momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotationally supported core is found in haloes that are located midway along cosmic filaments , cooled relatively more recently , and have experienced fewer mergers .",
    "the gas in these haloes is less lumpy and less turbulent and could retain most of its angular momentum . by a detailed study of the turbulent properties of the intra - halo medium ( hereafter ihm ) we have found that turbulence plays a major role at dissipating ( or preserving ) angular momentum via fragmentation of the ihm .",
    "turbulence in turn is fed by the merging process .",
    "we will show that compact over - dense blobs ( cobs ) form in highly biased regions at the centers of super - knots , while rotationally supported cores ( rscs ) form in the middle of filaments in nearly un - biased regions .",
    "our numerical experiments suggest that neither rotationally supported disks nor smbhs are a common occurrence in achs , and should be followed up by studying a larger sample of haloes , with more realistic gas physics and more detailed analyses of turbulent angular momentum transport .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ methodology ]",
    "we describe the details of our numerical simulations and our halo sample . in  [ results ] , we explain our analysis and show the physical quantities extracted from the simulations . in section",
    " [ discussion ] , we discuss our results and finally in  [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we used the amr code ramses @xcite with a modified non - equilibrium cooling module @xcite in order to study the main physical properties of both dm and gas components of 19 achs in the mass range @xmath26m@xmath27 to @xmath28m@xmath29 .",
    "we assumed the gas has primordial composition , and switched off all molecular cooling processes , allowing the gas to cool down only due to atomic hydrogen and helium lines .",
    "we worked in a concordance @xmath30cdm cosmological model : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the dynamical initial conditions were taken from _",
    "mpgrafic _ @xcite and the initial abundances of h , h@xmath37 , he , he@xmath37 and he@xmath38 , d , d@xmath37 and @xmath39 from @xcite at @xmath40 ( the initial redshift of the simulations ) .",
    "first , we performed a number of dm - only simulations with 256@xmath5 particles inside ( 3 mpc)@xmath5 , ( 5 mpc)@xmath5 , ( 5.5 mpc)@xmath5 and ( 8 mpc)@xmath5 boxes in order to look for achs , i.e. , haloes with virial temperatures t@xmath41k , which corresponds to a @xmath42m@xmath29 at @xmath0 .",
    "the relation @xmath43 was taken from @xcite and @xmath44 refers to the mass for a dm overdensity with a density contrast @xmath45 . in this study , we focus on @xmath0 , which corresponds to the epoch when achs are `` 2-@xmath46 '' objects and begin to have a significant abundance ( a few per mpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "using the hop algorithm @xcite we identified dm haloes in the dm simulations outputs at this redshift .",
    "our goal was to study the simplest , relatively isolated first protogalaxy , and we therefore avoided haloes that are undergoing an obvious merger at @xmath0 . we have found that mergers are very common at high redshift , and we have rejected many simulations ( containing @xmath47 pre - selected haloes ) in which no such isolated dm halo was found , before arriving at a sample of 19 suitable , non - merging dm haloes .",
    "we then performed a new set of gas+dm simulations for these 19 haloes , in 19 different runs .",
    "each of these re - simulation runs were performed with @xmath48 dm particles inside the corresponding original simulation volume . from @xmath40",
    "to @xmath0 in order to follow the main process of gas collapse into the achs at higher resolution . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we summarize the properties of our 19 haloes , and the simulations in which they were identified .",
    "the virial quantities are computed from the halo mass taking the expressions of @xcite .",
    "each of our simulations used @xmath49 cpu hours ( for a total of @xmath50 total cpu hours for the whole simulation suite ) on a cluster with @xmath51 cores and @xmath52 tb of distributed memory .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ mergertable ]",
    "by definition , the achs have a virial temperature @xmath53 . these haloes lose part of the thermal energy generated through the gravitational collapse process by h ( and he near @xmath54 ) emission line cooling , and reach a temperature floor of @xmath55 .",
    "this fact can be seen in the temperature profiles in figure  [ t_radial ] , which show a constant @xmath55 inside @xmath56 .",
    "the gas density profiles approximately follow a power ",
    "law @xmath57 , in - between the profiles expected from pressureless cosmological infall @xmath58 and infall of non - radiating gas through shocks @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivation for this work was indeed to look for large ( @xmath60 ) , rotationally supported gaseous disks inside the achs .",
    "this is expected in the simplest toy models ( e.g.@xcite ) , in which efficient cooling allows the gas to collapse preferentially in the direction parallel to its angular momentum vector , while acquiring increasing rotational support in the plane perpendicular to this direction  eventually settling to a rotationally supported disk .",
    "interestingly , we find that collapse indeed occurs preferentially along specific directions , and the gas has a less spherical shape than the host dm haloes .",
    "haloes with masses above @xmath61 , @xmath62 present a flattened gas distribution , with @xmath63 .",
    "this is in agreement with the earlier results by @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the minor axis of the gas distribution is _ not _ aligned with its angular momentum vector - the offset is between 30 - 90 degrees .",
    "this invalidates the above simple picture .",
    "furthermore , we find that none of these flattened gas distributions are rotationally supported ; their spin parameters are well below unity .",
    "interestingly , in 3 of our haloes the gas in the core does reach @xmath64 , but these rotationally supported cores are found in the lowest - mass haloes , and are closer to spherical blobs than to geometrical disks . in summary , we have proposed the following requirements for the gas distribution to qualify as a conventional `` disk '' :    * a low @xmath65 and a high @xmath66 , * a high gas spin parameter @xmath67 and * an alignment ( to within @xmath68 ) of the angular momentum vector of the gas with the minor axis of the associated ellipsoid .",
    "we find _ no _ disks in our sample of 19 atomic cooling haloes that satisfy this set of intuitive criteria .",
    "another interesting result from our study is that the directions of the angular momentum vectors of the gas and dm components are significantly misaligned .",
    "the misalignment angle @xmath69 for most of the haloes ; in fact , for a third of the haloes in our sample , we find @xmath70 , i.e. the gas and the dm components counter - rotate .    following the simple scenario in which the baryonic matter acquires an average sam @xmath71 , as assumed in @xcite and @xcite , we should expect a negligible misalignment angle .",
    "three of our haloes present alignment to within @xmath72 .",
    "as mentioned above , these haloes have a high spin parameter and a high @xmath73 , suggesting that they are in a more advanced state of collapse compared with the rest of the haloes .",
    "one reason for the high misalignment angles in most of the haloes could be that the gas in these haloes have not yet fully collapsed , and the dm and gas components have not had enough time to interact and reach a stable , aligned state . as mentioned above , @xcite have recently studied the relative angular momenta of gas and dm in haloes at lower redshifts , and also found significant differences , due to the very different dynamics of the gas and the dm once they cross the central region of the halo .",
    "it has also been pointed out by angles - alcazar & dav ( in preparation ) .     and @xmath74 order @xmath75 .",
    "this ratio is expected to be @xmath76 for fully developed , highly supersonic turbulence , and higher for less - developed , weaker turbulence ( see text ) .",
    "halo type ( i.e. haloes with cobs or rscs ) correlate with both this value and mass of the dm halo , hinting at turbulence as a possible explanation of the different morphologies of these objects .",
    "the error bars correspond to the r.m.s among the different haloes for each class of objects . ]",
    "the haloes forming cobs are among the most massive at @xmath0 and are the first to cool . ]",
    "our simulations show evidence for the formation of rscs and cobs .",
    "the haloes in which these two different gas configurations are found have very different physical features , in terms of turbulence , merger history and larger - scale environment .",
    "these difference can help us understand the reason for having such different primordial objects .",
    "the radial profiles of the specific angular momenta and the spin parameters show that in the 3 haloes where the gas component reaches a rotational support at small radius , @xmath77 and a @xmath78 inside @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "the haloes forming cobs have low gas spin parameters , and much flatter spin parameter profiles , indicating that the gas could efficiently transport its angular momentum . as described above",
    ", the two types of haloes have very different merger histories : table [ mergertable ] shows that the cob haloes have suffered many more mergers than the rsc haloes and that they have cooled their gas earlier ( fig .  [ z_cool ] ) .",
    "the early cooling and the multitude of mergers can explain the fact that the gas in the cob haloes have a much more clumpy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ pdf_rho ] ) , which may explain the efficient transfer of angular momentum , and the rapid and narrowly collimated gas inflows ( fig .",
    "[ map_flux ] ) in these haloes - creating strong shocks and driving strong turbulence in the central regions , eventually forming the cobs .        in order to distinguish haloes with a diagnostic that is explicitly related to turbulence",
    ", we have measured the velocity structure functions of the gas within the inner @xmath80 .",
    "the structure functions of order @xmath81 are defined as : @xmath82 where the velocity component @xmath83 is parallel ( longitudinal structure function ) or perpendicular ( transversal structure function ) to the vector @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and the spatial average is over all values of the position @xmath86 ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the power - law exponents of the longitudinal structure function of @xmath87 and @xmath74 order , @xmath75 , has been shown to depend on the strength of turbulence @xcite .",
    "in particular , for highly developed supersonic turbulence , @xcite finds the general scaling @xmath88 which for @xmath89 yields a value of 0.74 .",
    "we have computed this ratio for each of our 19 halos , and show the average values , with r.m.s .",
    "errors , for the three types of halos separately in figure  [ fig : structure ] .",
    "interestingly , the two types of halos with rscs or cobs have significantly different ratios , @xmath90 versus @xmath91 , which can be attributed to the different turbulent conditions .",
    "the value for the cob - forming halos is close to the boldyrev - type ( i.e. highly supersonic , fully developed ) turbulence . from figure  2 in @xcite",
    ", we see that the higher value of @xmath92 for the halos with rscs corresponds to less supersonic , and less well - developed turbulence ( but still above the value for kolmogorov subsonic turbulence ) .",
    "perhaps most interesting is the clear correlation between the halo mass and structure function ratio , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] . without further simulations and analysis ,",
    "it is unclear what causes this correlation , but we speculate , consistent with our interpretations above , that it is due to the different merger histories , which in turn set the different turbulent conditions , which in turn create different types of objects . we will explore this hypothesis in more detail in a forthcoming publication .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the mergers suffered by the progenitor halo is not the only possible source of turbulence .",
    "a second possible source is rapid gas accretion through filaments , following the underlying dm structures .",
    "these two mechanisms can , in principle , both simultaneously contribute to driving turbulence .",
    "in particular , we found that the gas accretion rate for the cob haloes is @xmath93 times higher than the one presented in the rsc haloes , suggesting that this second mechanism must play an important role .",
    "finally , it is interesting to ask whether the larger - scale environments of the haloes may affect their turbulent properties , and the type of object that forms the haloes .",
    "figure [ map_dm ] shows maps of the projected dm surface density around the location of one of the rsc ( left panel ) and cob ( right panel ) haloes .",
    "the differences are evident : while the rsc halo is located at a typical point in a filamentary region , the cob - forming halo resides at the center of a dense knot in the cosmic web .",
    "these dm density maps support the idea that the more numerous mergers and more rapid accretion flows found in the cob haloes are connected to its larger - scale cosmic environment .",
    "in this study , we have presented the largest statistical cosmological hydro - simulation study of atomic - cooling haloes ( achs ) .",
    "we studied the physical properties of 19 isolated haloes at @xmath0 , covering a total comoving volume of @xmath94 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the simulations reach a spatial resolution of @xmath25 ( proper ) pc .",
    "we presented a comprehensive analysis of the gas and dm physical properties , including baryonic mass fractions , gas and dm shapes , gas and dm spin parameters , as well as the radial profiles , power spectra , and probability distribution functions of various halo and gas properties .",
    "our main goal was to study and understand the formation of any large galactic disks among achs , which may be stable and avoid fragmentation , suitable for forming smbhs .",
    "in particular , our aim was to assess whether disk formation was common among these haloes .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "none of our 19 haloes has formed a rotationally supported geometrical disk .",
    "while haloes with masses above @xmath95 have flattened geometrical shapes , they do not have significant rotational support .",
    "conversely , we find three lower - mass haloes in which a rotationally supported core develops , but the shape of this core is closer to spherical than to a disk .",
    "nevertheless , these cores are candidate sites for smbh formation .",
    "the gas spin parameter @xmath96 is higher than the dm spin parameter @xmath97 for some of our haloes above @xmath98m@xmath27 .",
    "this result is in superficial agreement with the simple picture of galactic disk formation , in which specific angular momentum is conserved , and the gas spin parameter increases , as the gas collapses inside the dm halo .",
    "however , we find that the magnitude of the gas and dm spins have little correlation , and their directions are also significantly misaligned .",
    "this indicates that the gas angular momentum does not follow the above simple picture .",
    "3 .   two of our most massive haloes developed very massive compact over - dense blobs , with masses of @xmath99few@xmath100 .",
    "the cobs form near the center of the haloes by strong shocks at the intersection of converging filamentary flows .",
    "however , unexpectedly , the blobs have large residual velocities , and they migrate to the haloes outskirts .",
    "the blobs are self - gravitating , and accrete rapidly ( @xmath101m@xmath29yr@xmath102 , measured at a distance of @xmath103 pc from their center ) .",
    "these cobs show no sign of fragmentation at our resolution , and are alternative candidate sites for smbh formation by direct collapse .",
    "4 .   the intra - halo medium is turbulent and supersonic ( with mach numbers @xmath104 ) . to demonstrate this",
    "we have computed structure functions and showed that for all haloes they are all consistent with structure functions above the kolmogorov regime .",
    "the cob formation is associated with a highly turbulent , supersonic ( mach numbers @xmath10 ) and lumpy environment due to a high mass accretion rate and an active merger history .",
    "this is likely related to their location at dense knots of the cosmic web . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotationally supported cores are associated with haloes that are less turbulent , undergo mergers much less frequently , and have a lower gas accretion rate .",
    "they are located midway along filaments in the cosmic web .",
    "we conclude that the angular momentum transport and the fate of gas in @xmath0 achs is intimately related to the turbulent conditions , which in turn is determined by the merging history and larger - scale environment of the halo .",
    "we hypothesize that haloes in highly biased regions have more numerous and earlier mergers , more lumpy and turbulent gas distributions , and more efficient transfer of angular momentum .",
    "the gas in such haloes can be accreted rapidly , along narrow streams , into a very dense central object , whose formation involves strong shocks .",
    "on the other hand , haloes in less biased regions have fewer mergers , and a less turbulent intra - halo medium , where gas inflow is more coherent and weaker overall . in such haloes ,",
    "a larger fraction of the angular momentum can be preserved , and thus eventually a rotationally supported configuration can be reached .",
    "our results are based on simplified simulations . since we assume the gas has primordial composition and @xmath2-cooling and prior star - formation in the haloes",
    "have been suppressed , our simulations can be regarded as numerical experiments .",
    "they may nevertheless be an accurate description of a small subset of atomic cooling haloes , exposed to strong enough lyman - werner radiation to prevent prior star - formation .",
    "if verified in a larger sample of haloes and with additional gas physics to account for metals , star - formation and feedback , our results will have implications for observations of the highest - redshift galaxies and quasars with jwst .",

    "<S> we have performed hydrodynamical simulations from cosmological initial conditions using the amr code ramses to study atomic cooling haloes ( achs ) at @xmath0 with masses in the range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the gas has primordial composition and @xmath2-cooling and prior star - formation in the haloes have been suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we present a comprehensive analysis of the gas and dm properties of 19 haloes at a spatial resolution of @xmath3 ( proper ) pc , selected from simulations with a total volume of @xmath4 ( comoving ) mpc@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest statistical hydro - simulation study of achs at @xmath6 to date . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the morphology , angular momentum , thermodynamical state , and turbulent properties of these haloes , in order to assess the prevalence of disks and massive overdensities that may lead to the formation of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find no correlation between either the magnitude or the direction of the angular momentum of the gas and its parent dm halo . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath7 of the haloes form rotationally supported cores . </S>",
    "<S> two of the most massive haloes , however , form massive , compact over - dense blobs , which migrate to the outer region of the halo . </S>",
    "<S> these blobs have an accretion rate @xmath8 ( at a distance of 100 pc from their center ) , and are possible sites of smbh formation . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the degree of rotational support and the fate of the gas in a halo is determined by its large - scale environment and merger history . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the two haloes that form over - dense blobs are located at knots of the cosmic web , cooled their gas early on ( @xmath9 ) , and experienced many mergers . </S>",
    "<S> the gas in these haloes is thus lumpy and highly turbulent , with mach numbers @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the haloes forming rotationally supported cores are relatively more isolated , located midway along filaments of the cosmic web , cooled their gas more recently , and underwent fewer mergers . as a result , the gas in these haloes is less lumpy and less turbulent ( mach numbers @xmath11 ) , and could retain most of its angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 14 haloes have a diverse range of intermediate properties . </S>",
    "<S> if verified in a larger sample of haloes and with additional physics to account for metals and star - formation , our results will have implications for observations of the highest - redshift galaxies and quasars with jwst .    </S>",
    "<S> galaxies : formation  large - scale structure of the universe  stars : formation  turbulence . </S>"
