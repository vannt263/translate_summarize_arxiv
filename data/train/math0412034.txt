    "extensive background and development of results can be found in temam @xcite , doering and gibbon @xcite , foias , manley , rosa and temam @xcite , and lemari - rieusset @xcite .",
    "ladyzhenskaya @xcite provides a recent interesting and accessible review of results .",
    "there are two classes of existence and uniqueness results for solutions to the navier - stokes equations ; existence and uniqueness for all time if the forcing and initial data are small enough in some specified function space , or existence and uniqueness for a short time for larger initial data .",
    "this paper falls into the former camp in giving a probabilistic representation in physical space of the solutions of ( [ ns ] ) when a smallness condition is satisfied by the given forcing and initial velocity .",
    "this results in a method of demonstrating existence and uniqueness of weak solutions ( in the sense of lemari - rieusset @xcite ) for all time under straightforward bounds on forcing and initial data .",
    "the focus is strictly on the navier - stokes equations in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed the method developed relies heavily on an integral formulation of the navier - stokes equations in @xmath0 incorporating leray s projection onto the subspace of divergence free vector fields .",
    "the stochastic representation given here has parallels with the representations given by mckean @xcite for solutions of the kolmogorov - petrovskii - piskunov equation and le jan and sznitman @xcite for solutions of the fourier transformed navier - stokes equations . in the seminal paper @xcite mckean",
    "gives the solution of the kpp equation @xmath7 with initial data @xmath8 , @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a branching brownian motion in @xmath13 with initial value @xmath14 .",
    "roughly here one can think of the laplacian term @xmath15 as producing the brownian motion , the @xmath16 term yielding the binary branching , and the @xmath17 term resulting in the exponential waiting time between branches .",
    "the existence of the solution is a consequence of the bound imposed on the initial data .",
    "lejan and sznitman in @xcite give the solution of the fourier transformed navier - stokes equations in @xmath0 @xmath18 in the form of a scaled expectation @xmath19 if both @xmath20 are uniformly small enough . here",

    "the term @xmath30 yields binary branching in space according to the normalized markovian kernel @xmath31 and the coefficients @xmath32 result in exponential waiting times between branches .",
    "this general framework is elaborated and extended via the introduction of fourier multiplier majorizing kernels in bhattacharya et al @xcite and @xcite . again",
    "the existence of solutions is a consequence of the functional bounds imposed on the forcing and initial data .",
    "the goal of this article is to construct a binary branching process with jumps that corresponds naturally to a formulation of solutions in physical space to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "it is not too surprising that this stochastic representation is more complicated than representations of solutions to the kpp equation or the fourier transformed navier - stokes equations .",
    "majorizing kernel pairs @xmath33 are introduced to be used as scaling multipliers . as such",
    "they both dominate the forcing and velocity and allow the construction of transition densities . additionally , combined with the laplacian term @xmath34 ,",
    "their presence can give rise to a @xmath35-brownian motion .",
    "the binary nature of the branching derives from the term @xmath36 . in this representation ,",
    "the waiting time between branches is related to first passage times for brownian motion rather than being exponential in nature .",
    "this somewhat complicated relationship is in part due to the incompressibility constraint .",
    "this leads to the construction of a markov process indexed by the binary tree rather than a markov process in time .",
    "analogous to the work of lejan and sznitman @xcite and bhattacharya et al @xcite , @xcite , the existence of solutions is a consequence of the bounds imposed on the forcing and initial data via majorizing kernel domination .",
