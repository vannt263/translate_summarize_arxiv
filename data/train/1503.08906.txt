    "in the past decade , ultracold atomic systems are one of the most actively studied fields in physics .",

    "another aim to study ultracold atoms is to search for new quantum phenomena whose existence is theoretically predicted .",
    "one of these example is the supersolid that has both a diagonal solid order and an off - diagonal superfluid order@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall consider a system of two - component bose gas in an artificial magnetic field@xcite .",
    "each component of the boson corresponds to an internal state of single boson .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system , and one component of the boson , which we call @xmath1-atom , is trapped by a harmonic potential , and the other boson , called @xmath2-atom , by an annular trap .",
    "the atoms are coherently transferred by a rabi coupling between two internal states .",
    "it should be remarked that recently closely related atomic system was realized in experiments@xcite . as we show in the present study , interplay of the harmonic and annular traps generates intriguing phenomena .",
    "that is , the system exhibits interesting behavior depending on the strength of the magnetic field , inter and intra - repulsions , and the rabi coupling .",
    "the present study was originally motivated by the findings of co - existing two kinds of superconductivity in the sn / si core - shell clusters@xcite , i.e. , we expected that a phenomenon similar to the double superconductivity of the sn / si core - shell cluster can be realized in a ultracold atomic system .",
    "however in due course , we have realized that the ultracold atomic system has strong versatility and controllability .",
    "much more interesting phenomena are to be observed in that system than we first expected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we explain the system of the two - component bose gas trapped by harmonic and annular potentials , and introduce gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) to study the system .",
    "the bosons are coupled with the artificial magnetic field that is generated , e.g. , by rotating the system .",
    "the rabi coupling that induces coherent transference between the @xmath1 and @xmath2-atoms is also introduced .",
    "rather detailed description of the numerical methods is also given .",
    "in sec.iii , we consider behavior of a single - component bec in the harmonic and annular potentials separately . in particular , we study the ring - shaped bec in the annular trap in detail .",
    "behavior of the bec is strongly depends on width of the annulus and strength of the artificial magnetic field . in the case of the quasi-1d case ,",
    "a phenomenon similar to the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect takes place as recently observed by the experiments@xcite . on the other hand for a relatively wide ring - shaped bec ,",
    "superflows are generated in regions near the boundaries .",
    "the superflows are similar to the surface supercurrents in superconductors in a strong magnetic field . in sec.iv , we study the two - component bose gas in the harmonic and annular traps with the repulsions and the rabi coupling .",
    "we fix the intra and inter - repulsions , and vary the strength of the rabi coupling to observe how the becs change . for a finite but small rabi coupling , vortices start to vibrate around their equilibrium locations . for a moderate rabi coupling , vortices of @xmath1-condensate flow along the boundaries of the @xmath2-atom ring - shaped condensate . as the rabi coupling is increased furthermore ,",

    "first @xmath1 and @xmath2-atom vortices start to correlate and they vibrate around their equilibrium locations of the vortex lattice . as the rabi coupling is increased , vortices of the @xmath1-atom move along the boundary of the ring - shaped @xmath2-condensate .",
    "this phenomenon occurs as a result of the superflow at the boundaries of the @xmath2-atom bec and the rabi coupling .",
    "this observation indicates an interesting possible method to control vortex movement in the condensate .",
    "we found that for a very large rabi coupling becs become unstable as the vortex flow disturbs the @xmath1-atom bec and then it induces instability of the @xmath2-atom bec again via the large rabi coupling .",
    "the results in the present study have been obtained by solving the gpes .",
    "it is desirable to see how the fluctuations , which are not taken into account in the gpes , change the results .",
    "the path - integral monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations are useful for this study , although the time evolution of the system can not be investigated by the mc simulations .",
    "the mc simulations on the present system are under study , and we hope that the results will be reported in the near future .",

    "<S> then we consider the coupled bose gas system in a magnetic field . in a strong magnetic field , vortices form a abrikosov triangular lattice in both bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , and locations of vortices in the becs correlate with each other by the rabi coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the strength of the rabi coupling is increased , vortices start to vibrate around their equilibrium locations . </S>",
    "<S> as the strength is increased further , vortices in the harmonic trap start to move along the boundaries of the annulus . </S>",
    "<S> finally for a large rabi coupling , the becs are destroyed . based on our findings about the bec in the annular trap </S>",
