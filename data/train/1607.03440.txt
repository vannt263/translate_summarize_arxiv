    "we recently expounded the relationship between fragmentation and the orbital properties for two well - known groups of genetically related long - period comets : one was the pair of c/1988 f1 ( levy ) and c/1988 j1 ( shoemaker - holt ) and the other was the trio of c/1988 a1 ( liller ) , c/1996 q1 ( tabur ) , and c/2015 f3 ( swan ) ( & kracht 2016 , referred to hereafter as paper  1 ) . prior to the discovery of the two groups , a genetic relationship as the provenance for close orbital similarity among comets was a subject of controversy , especially in the 1970s and early 1980s . in a contribution to the debate , kresk ( 1982 ) corroborated and extended whipple s ( 1977 ) criticism of pik s ( 1971 ) conclusion on the omnipresence of groups of related comets .",
    "kresk argued that there was no compelling evidence for the existence of a single pair or group of long - period comets that derive from a common parent , other than the kreutz system of sungrazers .",
    "the approach employed in the pre-1988 debate was always statistical in nature .",
    "in particular , kresk ( 1982 ) used a @xmath0-criterion , introduced by southworth & hawkins ( 1963 ) in their investigation of meteor streams . as a function of differences in the five orbital elements",
    " the argument of perihelion @xmath4 , the longitude of the ascending node @xmath5 , the inclination @xmath6 , the perihelion distance @xmath7 , and the eccentricity @xmath8  the @xmath0-criterion allows one to express the degree of similarity between two orbits in one - dimensional phase space .",
    "objects in orbits of the same spatial orientation that are identical in size and shape have .",
    "the @xmath0-values of the genetically related 1988 pair and the 19882015 trio , referred to above , are listed in table 1 .",
    "they never exceed @xmath10.008 , just as the @xmath0-values for the kreutz system s most tightly associated members ( such as c/1882 r1 and c/1965 s1 ) .",
    "the prime subject of kresk s study was a distribution of @xmath0-values among 546 comets [ a majority extracted from marsden ( 1979 ) and several added ] that arrived at perihelion before the end of 1980 and whose orbital periods exceeded 200 years ; the kreutz sungrazers were excluded . after finding 38 pairs ( and several chains ) of comets with and comparing them with three independent distributions of 546 randomly generated orbits ( accounting in part for observational selection effects ) , kresk concluded that the set of long - period comets exhibited no signs of nonrandom distribution .",
    "in particular , he judged orbital similarity of the comet pair with the least @xmath0-value of 0.084  c/1846  o1 ( de vico - hind ) and c/1973  d1 ( kohoutek )  not to be statistically significant on the grounds that comparison with the least @xmath0-values in the random samples , 0.1010.120 , suggested , on the average , a @xmath120% expectation that this was a random pair as well .",
    "unfortunately , kresk s failure to remove from his statistics the grossly inferior orbits of comets observed in early times marred his main results , and he addressed a much more meaningful subset of 438 long - period comets from the period of 18001980 rather inadequately .",
    "our closer examination of this subset shows that the minimum @xmath0-value in the three random samples then moves up to a range of 0.1130.134 and there is only an 11% expectation for c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 being a random pair .",
    "moreover , if this pair is removed from the set , the next pair s @xmath0-value of 0.129 is consistent with an average random sample with an expectation of 60% .",
    "interestingly , in an investigation that extended that  of kresk ( 1982 ) , lindblad ( 1985 ) found that an updated set of long - period comets displayed , at best , only marginally greater orbital similarity than did random samples .    from the statistical standpoint",
    ", the pair of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 appears to be something of an oddball ; at first sight , the orbital differences are not so plainly minute as those of obvious fragments of a common parent ( as , e.g. , c/1988  f1 and c/1988  j1 ; table  2 ) , yet they are not conforming to a random distribution so readily as the other fortuitous pairs on kresk s ( 1982 ) list .",
    "comparison of the 18461973 pair s @xmath0-value of 0.084 with those in table  1 suggests that this pair is orbitally bound together one order of magnitude less tightly than the 19882015 trio and two orders of magnitude less tightly than the 1988 pair . on the other hand",
    ", it should be emphasized that some members of the kreutz system , although genetically related beyond any doubt , have orbits far less similar and their @xmath0-values much larger than the 18461973 pair .",
    "for example , for the pair of c/1963  r1 ( pereyra ) and c/1965  s1 ( ikeya - seki ) , both kreutz sungrazers with very accurately determined orbits , although classified by marsden ( 1967 ) as members of different kreutz subgroups .",
    "in paper 1 we noted that the 1988 pair ( c/1988 f1 and c/1988 j1 ) was with high probability a single comet less than one half the orbital period before discovery , while the parent of the 19882015 trio was likely to have split near the previous perihelion passage .",
    "the process of fragmentation of the kreutz system began at least two ( sekanina & chodas 2004 ) and possibly many more ( marsden 1989 ; pik 1966 ) revolutions about the sun before the 19th and 20th century clusters were observed .",
    "it appears that the @xmath0-criterion , as a measure of orbital similarity , increases with the time elapsed since the fragmentation event , a trend that is by no means surprising .    by the same token",
    ", however , the @xmath0-criterion proves an unreliable tool in an effort to investigate a genetic relationship between two particular comets of unknown histories , and for other than statistical purposes appears to be useless . indeed , in meteor astronomy",
    " for which the @xmath0-criterion was developed  its application is limited to statistical studies only and is therefore fully justified .",
    "this experience suggests that a much more rigorous approach  pursued below  is required in order to gain insight into the fundamental issue of our interest :  _ are comets c/1846",
    "o1 and c/1973  d1 genetically related ? _",
    "comet c/1846 o1 was discovered independently by f.  de vico in rome and by j.  r.  hind in london on 1846 july 29 , some 2 hours apart ( de vico 1846 ; bishop 1852 ) .",
    "the comet was observed astrometrically for about two months , in september until the 26th only by argelander ( 1865 ) in bonn .",
    "the orbit in marsden & williams ( 2008 ) catalog was computed by vogel ( 1868 ) ; although the best in existence at this time , the orbit is only a parabola with no planetary perturbations applied and is clearly inadequate for an in - depth investigation of the comet s motion .",
    "no physical observations were made , and the comet s intrinsic brightness published by vsekhsvyatsky ( 1958 ) , is related to an apparent magnitude @xmath9 according to a formula , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the comet s geocentric and heliocentric distances ; this formula reflects an assumption that the comet s observed brightness varies as @xmath12 .",
    "] , is an estimate based on apparent magntidues assigned depending on the reported type and size of instruments large enough or too small to detect the comet .",
    "magnitude of 6.2 is readily obtained by ascribing a limiting magnitude of 9.5 to a glass of 30  mm aperture diameter and a magnification of 8@xmath13 at the comet s elevation of @xmath14 above the horizon . ]",
    "comet c/1973 d1 was discovered photographically by kohoutek ( 1973a ) in hamburg - bergedorf on 1973 february 28 and observed astrometrically for nearly 7  months , for the last time on september 22 by the discoverer ( kohoutek 1973b ) .",
    "the comet s astrometry is summarized ( including the references ) in the minor planet center s orbits / observations database .",
    "marsden ( 1973 ) noticed orbital similarity with c/1846 o1 from an early parabolic orbit based on a 5.9-days long arc , but it took much more time to rule out the identity of the two comets ( marsden 1974 ) .",
    "the currently available high - quality orbit , computed by marsden , reveals that the comet has last been near the sun some 16500  years ago ( marsden et al .",
    "brightness estimates are the only physical observations that are available : a series obtained visually by bortle ( 1982 ) before perihelion and a number of approximate total and `` nuclear '' photographic magnitudes ( e.g. , kojima 1973 , kohoutek 1973b ) that span almost the entire period of astrometric observations .    to address the issue of which of the two comets is likely to be intrinsically fainter , we now examine the light curve of c/1973  d1 .",
    "based on bortle s ( 1982 ) brightness estimates , spanning more than 70 days , from 1973 march  24 to june 3 , and terminating a few days before perihelion , the light curve is plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the observed magnitudes @xmath9 were first corrected for the aperture of the employed 31.6-cm reflector by subtracting 0.6  mag ( morris 1973 ) and thereby standardized to a photometric scale of the naked eye.0.019  mag cm@xmath2 , applying a correction of @xmath160.47  mag to reduce bortle s 31.6-cm reflector magnitudes to a standard aperture of 6.8  cm ( equivalent to @xmath160.6 mag for the naked eye ) . with reference to their correspondence , morris stated that bortle s own aperture correction was practically identical . ] the corrected magnitudes  @xmath17 were converted to @xmath18 by normalizing to a geocentric distance of with an inverse square power law , i.e. , .",
    "no phase correction was applied , because in the entire period of bortle s observations the phase angle varied only between 25@xmath14 and 38@xmath14 .",
    "however ,  if reduced to a zero phase angle , the data in figure  1 could be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter .",
    "the normalized magnitude variations of c/1973 d1 in figure  1 show no sign of flare - ups , but a polynomial fit of power 4 suggests that the light curve peaked about 20 days before perihelion .",
    "however , the last observation , made 4  days before perihelion , may have been affected by a small elongation from the sun , which was only 36@xmath14 .",
    "there was a marked tendency for the light curve to level off as the comet was approaching perihelion .",
    "down to a heliocentric distance @xmath11 of about 1.5  au , the comet brightened steeply , approximately as @xmath19 .",
    "if this trend continued , the comet s extrapolated normalized magnitude at would have been about  7 .",
    "the rate at which the brightness was increasing at is not at all well determined , but assuming , conservatively , an inverse square power law , the extrapolated normalized magnitude at a unit heliocentric and geocentric distances is ( figure  1 ) .",
    "an average @xmath20 fit implies an absolute magnitude of , 2  mag fainter than c/1846  o1 .",
    "however , such comparison is questionable because c/1846  o1 was discovered nine weeks after perihelion , while the bortle light curve refers to the time before perihelion .",
    "the difference should in fact be still greater , if c/1973  d1 was intrinsically fainter after perihelion .",
    "if hind s remark on the marginal appearance of c/1846  o1 in a sea - glass on 1846 july 30.9 ut , 65 days after perihelion , is indeed interpreted to imply magnitude 9.5 , we find for this comet  neglecting a small aperture correction of perhaps @xmath160.2  mag  that at and a phase angle of 35@xmath14 . on the other hand , c/1973  d1 was photographed by kohoutek ( 1973b ) on 1973 august  1.0 , 55  days after perihelion , as an object of total magnitude 15 , equivalent to at . since photographic observations underestimate the total brightness compared to visual data , we need to correct for this effect by comparing them with bortle s preperihelion observations .",
    "although kohoutek photographed c/1973  d1 several times between march  24 and june  3 , he provided no magnitudes on those occasions .",
    "the only total photographic magnitudes from the critical time span were magnitude  14 by wood at woolston on march 22.8 , magnitude  15 by mrkos at klet on april 4.9 ut , and magnitude  14 by hendrie at woolston on april 6.9 ut .",
    "comparison of the two consistent results with @xmath17 from bortle s data yields a photographic - to - visual correction of @xmath162.6  mag , which  if assumed to be approximately applicable also to kohoutek s magnitude scale  implies for his corrected post - perihelion data point at , that is , 2.8  mag fainter than c/1846  o1 at a slightly larger heliocentric distance .",
    "this essentially 3  mag difference , whose uncertainty is estimated at some @xmath210.5  mag , suggests that if the two comets are genetically related , then c/1846  o1 is likely to be the primary and c/1973  d1 its companion , a conclusion that will serve as a test in our orbit - evolution modeling .",
    "to address our primary objective  the relationship between the two comets  requires a comprehensive examination of the histories of their orbital motion and an in - depth study of their common parent s most probable motion .",
    "this general strategy consists of several consecutive steps , dealt with in the following subsections .      if c/1846 o1 and c/1973 d1 should be fragments of a common parent , their arrival times at perihelion and the other elements must satisfy certain conditions depending on the parent s fragmentation time .",
    "one fundamental property of the groups of genetically related long - period comets ( and nontidally split comets in general ) that c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 appear to satisfy is that the primary ( intrinsically the brightest and presumably the most massive ) fragment should arrive first . based on our experience that we gained from our study of a pair and a trio of genetically related long - period comets in paper  1 , the possible scenarios for the timing of the parent s fragmentation could be divided into three general categories:(a )  relatively recently , a fraction of one revolution about the sun before their recorded perihelion times in the 19th20th centurues ; ( b )  in a general proximity of perihelion in the previous return ; or ( c )  substantially earlier than in the course of the previous return to perihelion .",
    "the first scenario  a relatively recent event  is practically ruled out for two reasons .",
    "one is the unacceptably long period of time  127  years  between the arrival times of the two comets at perihelion , the other is the large differences between their other elements , as illustrated in table  2 . indeed , adopting the original orbital period of c/1973  d1 , computed by marsden ( marsden et al .",
    "1978 ) , as a first approximation to the parent s orbital period and ignoring the planetary perturbations , we find ( from the equations provided in section  2.1.1 of paper  1 ) that the fragmentation event would have taken place at a heliocentric distance of about 127  au , some 110  years after the previous perihelion passage or @xmath116400  years ago .",
    "thus , the assumption of a fragmentation scenario of category  ( a ) results in a scenario of category ( b ) .    on the same premise of the parent moving in an orbit with a period of @xmath116500 years , scenario of category ( b ) is self - consistent . in particular ,",
    "as shown below , it satisfies the basic relationship between the separation velocity and the difference of 127  years in the two comets arrival times , dictated by equation  ( 2 ) of paper  1 . replacing the component of the separation velocity along the orbital - velocity vector , @xmath22 , with the statistically averaged separation velocity , @xmath23 [ see the text in paper  1 near equation  ( 26 ) ] , we find on these assumptions for the presumed pair of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the heliocentric distance at the fragmentation time ( in au ) and is the perihelion distance ; the separation velocity comes out to be in m  s@xmath2 .",
    "this equation suggests a plausible submeter - per - second separation velocity near perihelion and a still acceptable separation velocity of just below 3  m  s@xmath2 at the 127  au from the sun , mentioned above .",
    "it appears that the 127-year gap between c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 is consistent with the same straightforward explanation that accounted for the 1988 - 2015 trio in paper  1 , and that therefore the 1846 - 1973 pair is , too , genetically related .",
    "there are only two potential problems :  ( i )  a major difference of more than 3@xmath14 in the argument of perihelion between the two apparent fragments of the same parent and ( ii )  the premise that the parent  and therefore also c/1846  o1  had an original orbital period of 16000 to 17000  years , close to that of c/1973  d1 ; both points are so critical to the relationship issue that an in - depth investigation of the orbital motion of c/1846  o1 was absolutely indispensable .      because the orbit derived by vogel ( 1868 ) is so highly unsatisfactory , our goal was to compute an improved solution from scratch , using vogel s references to the publications with the original astrometric positions .",
    "we considered it desirable to replace these with new positions based on comparison - star positions from the _ hipparcos _ or _",
    "tycho-2 _ catalogs .",
    "our effort was first directed toward ascertaining , for each published observation , the comet s offsets in right ascension and declination from the comparison star as well as toward identifying the star .",
    "vogel ( 1868 ) collected 40 astrometric observations that were made at nine sites .",
    "consulting the original references , we soon found that of the 11 positions measured by hind at bishop s observatory in the regent s park section of london ( bishop 1852 ) , eight were not obtained by micrometric comparison with a field star , but by reading the circles of the equatorial ( referred to in the publication as `` instrumental positions '' ) .",
    "we excluded these from the data set because of their inherent low accuracy .",
    "in addition , because of incomplete information available , we could neither determine the offsets from the comparison star measured by j.  challis ( hind 1846 ) at cambridge ( u.k . ) on july  30 nor identify the comparison star used by e.  j.  cooper ( graham 1846 ) at markree on august  31 .",
    "for the remaining 30  observations we were able to recover both the comparison stars and the offsets .",
    "in addition , we also were able to identify , in the _",
    "tycho-2 _ catalog , comparison stars for two observations , for which vogel was lacking information and did not include them in his data set .",
    "we thus ended up with a total of 32 re - reduced and updated astrometric positions for our orbit determination .",
    "code , written by a.  vitagliano and in possession of the second author , was employed to carry out the computations .",
    "the code accounts for the perturbations by the eight planets , by pluto , and by the three most massive asteroids ; and it applies a differential least - squares optimization procedure to compute the orbital elements .",
    "we began by fitting all 32 observations , of which three , found to be fundamentally incorrect , leaving residuals in excess of 80@xmath26 , were immediately discarded ; comparison with vogel s ( 1868 ) paper showed that these were the same observations that gave similarly unacceptable residuals from his preliminary orbit .",
    "an elliptical solution was then found that satisfied the remaining 29 positions with a mean residual of @xmath2110@xmath27.9 , but showed that one observation left a residual exceeding 3@xmath28 .",
    "next we applied progressively tighter rejection  cutoffs from 30@xmath26 down to 6@xmath26 , paying particular attention to variations in the osculating orbital period as a function of the rejection cutoff .",
    "the results , exhibited in table  3 , suggest that the osculating orbital period @xmath29 was nominally always between 350  yr and 700  yr , that at 1@xmath28 , and that at 3@xmath28 . this result is significant for two reasons : one , it shows that a parabola , as employed by vogel ( 1868 ) , is an unacceptable approximation ; and , two , indicates that this comet revolves about the sun @xmath110 or more times in the same period of time in which c/1973  d1 makes just a single revolution .",
    "this major discrepancy and its implications will be addressed in greater detail in section  3.4 .",
    "table 4 offers our preferred orbital solution for comet c/1846 o1 , computed for a standard 40-day epoch of osculation at a rejection cutoff of 6@xmath26 .",
    "relative to vogel s ( 1868 ) orbit , we note  besides the major deviation from a parabola  significant differences in the other elements as well , amounting to about 10 times the mean error :  the perihelion time 1.4  days earlier , the argument of perihelion 1@xmath30.3 lower , the longitude of the ascending node and the inclination ( reckoned relative to the normal to the ecliptic plane ) both more than 0@xmath30.2 higher , and the perihelion distance more than 0.02 au smaller . the distribution of residuals from all 32 observations is presented in table 5 ; the rejected observations are parenthesized .",
    "although we considered taking marsden s definitive orbit based on 38 observations ( marsden et al .",
    "1978 ; also marsden & williams 2008 ) as a starting set of elements for further computations , we eventually decided to recompute the orbit for two reasons .",
    "one , we preferred a very tight rejection cutoff for the residuals and were uncertain of what cutoff was applied by marsden in his solution .",
    "more importantly , we were bent on estimating and/or constraining the magnitude of the nongravitational effects on the motion of the comet , given its feeble intrinsic brightness ( figure 1 ) , for which we had to get involved with fitting the observations anyway .",
    "we collected 42  astrometric observations from the minor planet center s database ( section  2 ) and from the first orbital run we established that the residuals from four observations exceeded 3@xmath26 , which thus was the rejection cutoff chosen by marsden .",
    "we tested solutions at the rejection cutoffs of 2@xmath27.5 ( with 34  observations surviving ) and at 2@xmath26 ( with 31  observations ) , and adopted the latter solution for further investigation of the comet s orbital evolution .",
    "this set of elements is presented in table  4 , while the residuals from all 42  observations are in table  6 , the rejected ones again parenthesized .",
    "a high degree of similarity between this orbit and that by marsden is apparent from the small differences in the individual elements , but thanks to the tighter rejection cutoff , the mean errors of our orbital elements are nearly a factor of two lower than marsden s ( marsden et al .  1978 ) .",
    "the differences in the sense `` marsden orbit minus orbit in table  4 '' and the mean errors of the marsden orbit are :  + 0.00079@xmath310.00065  day in the perihelion time , + 0@xmath30.00045@xmath310@xmath30.00040 in the argument of perihelion , + 0@xmath30.00001@xmath310@xmath30.00007 in the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath32.00010@xmath310@xmath30.00017 in the inclination , + 0.0000030@xmath310.0000045 au in the perihelion distance , and + 0.0000192@xmath310.0000182 in the eccentricity . these differences appear to be comparable to the mean errors of the marsden set of elements . on the other hand , for five of the six elements the differences are clearly larger than the mean errors of our set of elements in table  4 ; on the average the ratio of the difference to the mean error is 1.55 .",
    "we also investigated the distribution of residuals from the solutions with the rejection cutoffs of 3@xmath26 and 2@xmath26 and found that the residuals differed systematically by up to 0@xmath27.6 in right ascension and by up to 0@xmath27.3 in declination . since these residuals reflect differences of 1.55 times the mean error of the elements , we considered as acceptable only systematic residuals between the two sets of up to 0@xmath27.2 in right ascension and up to 0@xmath27.1 in declination , equivalent , on the average , to deviations in the orbital elements of up to 0.5 their mean errors .",
    "we were now ready to investigate the effects of the nongravitational acceleration , employing the standard style ii formalism introduced by marsden et al .",
    "we examined separately the effects due to a radial component ( with an amplitude of @xmath33 at 1  au from the sun ) , a transverse component ( with an amplitude @xmath34 ) , and a normal component ( an amplitude @xmath35 ) .",
    "we obtained specific orbital solutions by forcing two different magnitudes of the nongravitational accelerelation , found that the peak residuals varied in proportion to the acceleration s amplitude , and concluded that each of the three components made the fit unacceptable by increasing the systematic residuals beyond the allowed levels unless @xmath36      perfunctory inspection of table 4 reveals immediately that c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 arrived at their perihelia at nearly the same time of the year ; while this fact implies that their paths over the sky must have been rather similar ( given that the other elements are also very much alike ) , this coincidence is from the standpoint of the two comets potential relationship inconsequential .",
    "our orbital solution for c/1973 d1 in table 4 confirms that the comet s previous return to perihelion occurred some 16000 to 17000 years ago .",
    "even though the mean error in our solution is almost a factor of two lower than in marsden et al.s ( 1978 )  @xmath21420  yr vs @xmath21750  yr  the difference in the nominal original orbital period is only 220  yr . on the other hand , the discrepancy between our and vogel s ( 1868 ) sets of orbital elements for c/1846  o1 is quite significant , as already pointed out in section 3.2 .",
    "it should be noted that while the worrisome difference between c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 of 3@xmath30.9 in the argument of perihelion now dropped to merely 2@xmath30.6 , the difference in the perihelion distance increased from 0.006  au to 0.027  au .",
    "the most striking finding in table  4 is the orbital period for c/1846  o1 .",
    "although the quality of the set of elements for this comet is markedly inferior to that of c/1973  d1 , it is extremely unlikely that the orbital period of c/1846  o1 exceeded @xmath11600  yr regardless of the adopted rejection cutoff for the residuals , as is documented by table  3 .",
    "this upper limit on the orbital period is still one order of magnitude shorter than the original orbital period of c/1973  d1 .",
    "the poorly determined nominal orbital period of c/1846  o1 in table  4 is more than 30 times shorter than that of c/1973  d1 .    under these circumstances ,",
    "a temporal gap of 127  yr between the two comets is inconsequential and the promisingly looking straightforward explanation of their genetic relationship , expounded in section 3.1 , is invalidated , as it is trivial to show that the effects of splitting can not alone insert fragments into orbits as different as to have the orbital periods of , respectively , 500  yr and 16300  yr . indeed , a differential velocity along the orbital - velocity vector at perihelion 1.38  au from the sun ( the only part of the parent s orbit presumably shared by such fragments before splitting ) comes out in this case to be about 180  m  s@xmath2 and it would not drop below 70  m  s@xmath2 even in an extreme case of c/1846  o1 s orbital period of 1600  yr . since , in addition , a statistically averaged   separation velocity is @xmath37 times higher than its orbital - velocity component ( section 2.2.1 of paper  1 ) , the typical separation velocities implied , some  m  s@xmath2 , are fully two to three orders of magnitude higher than the known separation velocities of the split comets ( which are submeter- to meter - per - second ; e.g. , sekanina 1982 ) . accordingly , c/1846",
    "o1 and c/1973  d1 must already have been separate objects in the previous return to perihelion 1600017000  years ago , and if they are fragments of a common parent comet at all , it must have broken up substantially earlier than in the course of the previous return to perihelion  invoking the fragmentation category c in section 3.1 .",
    "another noteworthy property of the two orbits in table  4 , especially of the orbit of c/1973  d1 , is the position of the line of nodes .",
    "the comet s passage through its ascending node 122 days before perihelion at a heliocentric distance of 2.19  au is of no particular interest , but the passage through its descending node 274  days after perihelion at a heliocentric distance of 3.74  au is significant because the comet is then not too far from the jovian orbit , whose heliocentric distance at that longitude is 4.98  au .",
    "close encounters of the comet with the planet , down to @xmath10.6  au , are in fact possible especially around 100  days past the passage through the descending node , when the comet is south of the planet s orbit plane and moving away from it .",
    "if the planet is in that part of its orbit at the time , its gravity is pulling the comet in the direction opposite the motion into an orbit of shorter period , as schematically depicted in figure  2 ( a configuration ) .",
    "the jovian gravity can also pull the comet into an orbit of longer period ( a configuration ) , but the magnitude of such an effect is generally smaller because of a larger jovicentric distance of the comet .    the uncertainties in the orbital motions of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 , especially in their orbital periods , prevent us from investigating any particular scenario of a potential genetic relationship between the two comets .",
    "instead , we examine whether _ such a relationship could in principle be possible_.    the orbit of c/1973  d1 in table  4 is suitable as a starting point to undertake this task because it is of adequate quality for this purpose and supplies credible evidence that the potential fragmentation did not occur more recently than 1600017000  years ago .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the fact that , if related , c/1973  d1 would be a companion to c/1846  o1 .",
    "in addition , the tight limits on the magnitude of the nongravitational acceleration in the orbital motion of c/1973  d1 [ relations ( 2 ) ] rule out its major effect on the results ; accordingly , we will be working with the gravitational orbit in table  4 .",
    "the next step in our investigation was the integration of the motion of c/1973 d1 back in time to the previous passage through perihelion , employing an extended version of the standard jpl de421 ephemeris .",
    "since we dealt with time intervals of up to @xmath120000  years , we first conducted thorough tests of truncation errors by comparing results of integration to 15 decimal places with those to 17 decimal places  the actual precision employed in our computations . in the absence of close encounters with jupiter the truncation errors remained in a subsecond range over the entire period of time . in the presence of four encounters , the differences between the two precision limits amounted to about 2  seconds after integration over 10000  yr , 30  minutes after 15000  yr , and 1.5  days after 20000  yr , so the precision to 17  decimal places assured us that errors did not exceed 0.02  second after 10000  yr , 20  seconds after 15000  yr , and 1300  seconds after 20000  yr . we were confident that truncation should not affect our results appreciably , except when at least four encounters and integration over @xmath120  millennia were involved ; we return to this issue in section 6 .",
    "the reciprocal original semimajor axis of c/1973  d1 derived from the orbital elements in table  4 comes out to be  ( au)@xmath2 .",
    "direct integration of the nominal orbit from 1973 back in time resulted in a perihelion time of april  18 of the year @xmath1614321 or 14322  bce .",
    "since perihelion was also the osculation epoch of the orbital set , the solution includes the post - perihelion planetary perturbations of the comet s motion in that return .",
    "the comet did not get closer to jupiter than 4.556  au ( 10  days after perihelion ) . because the mean error in the orbital period is @xmath21420  yr , the probability that the nominal case represents the real situation is very close to zero , which justifies the search for a range of plausible solutions , primarily those that involve an encounter with jupter ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "we addressed this issue by varying slightly the 1973 orbit eccentricity of c/1973  d1 and by examining  the changing circumstances during the comet s previous return to perihelion , including its motion relative to jupiter .",
    "we discovered that the most significant orbital changes occurred in a range of adopted eccentricities from to , which differ from the nominal value by 2.7% to 4% of its mean error and are perfectly tolerable deviations .",
    "the major results , presented in figure  3 , include three orbital elements with the planetary perturbations integrated down to perihelion  the argument of perihelion @xmath4 , the perihelion distance @xmath7 , and the reciprocal semimajor axis @xmath3 ( all at the osculation epoch of perihelion )  and two jovian - encounter parameters  the time of closest approach reckoned from the comet s perihelion time , @xmath38 , and the minimum distance from the planet , @xmath39 .",
    "they are plotted against the comet s perihelion time , which ranges from @xmath1614326  june  1 to @xmath1614324  april  1 , thus covering a period of 22  months .    inspecting three of the curves in figure 3",
    " those for @xmath3 , @xmath40 , and @xmath39 , we note the prominent variations in @xmath3 that show two distinct extremes referring to the perihelion times 264  days , or nearly 9  months , apart .",

    "the comet s motion was integrated back in time ; when reckoning the @xmath3 variations in the forward direction , the @xmath3 maximum refers to the case of a peak acceleration of the comet s orbital motion ( a maximum increase in the orbital period ) , while the @xmath3 minimum to that of a peak deceleration ( a maximum decrease in the orbital period ) .",
    "we may perceive the two extremes as belonging to two hypothetical objects , h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 , and formulate our findings as follows : + ( 1a ) a hypothetical object h@xmath41 , moving in the post - encounter orbit of comet c/1973  d1 and having closest approach to jupiter 341 days after perihelion ( which took place on @xmath1614325  june  27 ) , had at perihelion  a  pre - encounter .",

    "thus , h@xmath42 passed through its perihelion 264  days earlier than h@xmath41 and reached the point of closest approach to jupiter  days earlier than h@xmath41 .",
    "before the encounters , h@xmath42 was moving ahead of h@xmath41 in an orbit that was very similar to , but slightly more elongated than , the orbit of h@xmath41 .",
    "the difference between the two objects in the pre - encounter value of @xmath3 equals  ( au)@xmath2 near perihelion , in the sense h@xmath43h@xmath42 .",
    "+ next we propose a scenario : + ( 2a ) let object h@xmath41 be identical with comet c/1973  d1 ; its pre - encounter at perihelion , whereas its post - encounter @xmath3 far from the sun   eventually equal to .",
    "+ ( 2b ) let a third object , h@xmath44 , have its jovian encounter at the same time as h@xmath42 , but before the encounter it was moving in the orbit of h@xmath41 rather than h@xmath42 .",

    "o1 , so that both comets were moving along the same pre - encounter orbit . + ( 2d ) let the gap of 264 days between c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 be a product of their parent s fragmentation some time before they reached perihelion in the course of the 15th millennium bce .",
    "+ this scenario allows us to arrive at the following three conclusions : + ( 3a ) near perihelion , the pre - encounter @xmath3 of both c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 equaled + 0.002095  ( au)@xmath2 and their orbital period @xmath110400  yr .",
    "due to the separation velocity of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 , a product of their parent s fragmentation ; its magnitude is estimated at @xmath10.000001  ( au)@xmath2 . ] far from the sun on the way to perihelion the comets orbital period was equal to @xmath17160  yr .",
    "the leading position of c/1846  o1 suggests that it was the primary fragment , c/1973  d1 was the companion ( cf .",
    "the comet groups in paper  1 ) .",
    "+ ( 3b ) proximately equal to 0.002046  ( au)@xmath2 , the difference be-  @xmath3  of c/1973  d1 eventually equaled + 0.0015555  ( au)@xmath2  ( with the orbital period of 16300  yr ) , it follows that the post - encounter @xmath3 of c/1846  o1 should have amounted to about and its orbital period to a little less than 5000  yr . + ( 3c ) accordingly , the motions of the two comets were perturbed during their jovian encounters very  unevenly , as their times of closest approach differed by 165  days , a gap that was the product of their increasing separation following the parent s earlier fragmentation event . and",
    "while the motion of c/1973  d1 was  accelerated by the perturbations into an orbit with  a  period of @xmath116300  yr , the motion of c/1846  o1 was slowed down so profoundly that this comet ended up in an orbit whose period was shorter by a factor of more than 3 .",
    "+ although the contrast between the orbital periods of the two fragments is rather astonishing , there are two problems that still remain to be settled .",
    "one is the conditions at the time of the parent s fragmentation needed to explain the 264-day gap between the two comets , and the second is the process of shortening the orbital period of c/1846  o1 from the nearly 5000  yr down to @xmath11000  yr or less to make the scenario consistent with the range of periods derived from the observations ( tables  3 and 4 ) .",
    "a solution to the first of the two issues is straightforward , because there exists a precedent :  the pair of long - period comets c/1988  f1 and c/1988  j1 was shown in paper  1 to split off from the parent comet , which was on its way to perihelion , hundreds of au from the sun . an assumed separation velocity of about 1  m  s@xmath2 in the radial direction was all that was needed to explain a gap of 76  days between the two comets , measured by the gap between their times of perihelion passage .",
    "the most probable heliocentric distance of the birth of c/1988  f1 and c/1988  j1 was @xmath1400  au after aphelion , which is equivalent to a time of nearly 700  yr before the next perihelion . given that the orbital period of the 1988 comets was just about 14000  yr ( paper  1 ) , timewise the event took place about 10 times closer to perihelion than aphelion .    because the required post - fragmentation gap of 264 days between the modeled perihelion times of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 was nearly 3.5  times wider and because the comets were moving in an orbit with a period of 7160  yr far from the sun , a separation velocity of 1  m  s@xmath2 in the radial direction",
    " a representative value based on the arguments presented in paper  1  would require the fragmentation event to have occurred @xmath1600  au from the sun some 1650  yr before perihelion .",
    "the perturbation effect by jupiter on c/1846  o1 was found to increase by a fair amount after we introduced , in addition , a normal component of the separation velocity of 0.5  m  s@xmath2 , since the comet was brought a little closer to the planet at the critical time .",
    "the normal component could not be increased any further in order to keep the velocity s magnitude from exceeding @xmath11  m  s@xmath2 by a wide margin .",
    "the details of this phase of our work are in section  4 .    in subsequent runs",
    "we tested the dependence of the results on the location of the fragmentation event in the orbit , at earlier times .",
    "as the required radial component of the separation velocity was then lower , we could increase the normal component beyond 0.5 m s@xmath2 and further boost the jovian perturbations on the comet without violating the total - velocity magnitude constraint .",
    "for example , moving the fragmentation event to 700  au from the sun along the incoming leg of the parent s orbit , some 2500  yr before perihelion , required a separation velocity of about 0.4  m  s@xmath2 in the radial direction to accomodate the 264  days gap between c/1836  o1 and c/1973  d1 at perihelion in the 17th millennium bce , thus allowing us to increase the velocity s normal component to at least 0.8  m  s@xmath2 .",
    "timewise the event now took place closer to aphelion than to the next perihelion .",
    "similarly , we investigated a few additional scenarios , in which the fragmentation event was assumed to have taken place , respectively , at aphelion and at 700  au and 500  au from the sun before aphelion .",
    "the radial component required to accommodate the 264-day gap was only a small fraction of 1  m  s@xmath2 , and the normal component could be increased up to 1  m  s@xmath2 . as a special case",
    ", we also considered a scenario with the fragmentation event having occurred shortly after the previous perihelion .",
    "the gap between the two comets at the next perihelion was now increased by exactly 8 jupiter s orbital periods ( to preserve the required geometry ) , allowed by a radial separation velocity slightly exceeding 1  m  s@xmath2 .",
    "rigorous orbital computations confirmed both our conclusion ( 3b ) in section  3.5 concerning the post - encounter orbit of c/1846  o1 and the correlation between the orbital location of the fragmentation event and the radial component of the separation velocity .",
    "consistent with expectation , all 264-day - gap solutions showed that the comet s initial post - fragmentation perihelion ought to have taken place in late september through october of @xmath1614326 in order that the jovian encounter in december of @xmath1614325 could shorten the orbital period substantially .    in all scenarios that were run , the first post - encounter orbital period of c/1846  o1 was below 5000  yr , close to 400 jovian sidereal periods , and more than a factor of two shorter than the post - fragmentation , pre - encounter orbital period of 10400  yr at perihelion .",
    "this result is a corollary of the verified conclusion ( 3b ) of section 3.5 . the first post - encounter orbital period correlated rather indistinctly with the normal component of the separation velocity , a higher velocity leading generally to a slightly shorter period .",
    "the length of the period did vary to a degree with the orbital location of the fragmentation event , the shortest period taking place when it occurred near but prior to the aphelion passage .",

    "figure  4 further shows that , statistically , the pattern of perturbations , dominated by the encounter with jupiter , slightly favors outward diffusion , toward larger orbits and longer orbital periods .",

    "it is invariably assumed that the diffusion process is governed by the gaussian law .",
    "zhou et al .  ( 2002 ) pointed out , however , that the gaussian approximation is appropriate only for small perturbations of @xmath3 accumulating over a number of revolutions .",
    "when an average perturbation per revolution is not small in comparison with the final change in @xmath3 , zhou et al .",
    "proposed that the orbital evolution is governed by the lvy ( 1937 ) random walk because of a disproportionately large contribution by the significant perturbation events due to close approaches to jupiter .",
    "the lvy walk appears to better fit enhanced ( or anomalous ) diffusion and has a number of applications in physics ( e.g. , shlesinger et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the paradigm of random walk , applicable to a statistical sample , has no prognosticative merit in an individual case .",
    "in fact , the best known triggers of dramatically enhanced rates of diffusion in the orbital evolution of comets are the occasional very close encounters with jupiter ( ) , during which an orbit can be transformed beyond a shade of recognition .",
    "they happen in spite of their extremely low _ a priori _ probabilities of occurrence .",
    "an example is c/1770  l1 ( lexell ) , observed at a single apparition as a short - period  comet  with a period of 5.60  yr and approaching the earth to a record minimum distance of 0.0151  au on 1770 july  1 ( sekanina  & yeomans 1984 ) .",
    "the comet s orbital history was investigated more than once ( e.g. , lexell 1778 ; le verrier 1857 ; callandreau 1892 ; kazimirchak - polonskaya 1967 , 1972 ; carusi et al .  1985 ) .",
    "there is a general consensus that the comet had very close encounters with jupiter shortly before discovery and again a dozen years later .",
    "the results of the computations by kazimirchak - polonskaya ( 1967 ) show that the first encounter took place in march 1767 ( ) and the second one in july 1779 ( ) . the total perturbation effect of the first event was about , of the second event at least .",
    "these energy jumps are two orders of magnitude greater than the peak integrated perturbation effect for c/1973  d1 in figure  4",
    ".      isolated close encounters with jupiter , ruled out in the case of c/1846  o1 , are not the only means to distinctly disrupt a comet s evolution of slow , random orbital diffusion .",
    "another well - known example of a strongly nonradom pattern of cometary motions is orbital ( mean - motion ) resonance , defined classically as a periodic gravitational influence of a perturbing planet ( usually jupiter ) due to the two bodies orbital periods having a ratio of two small integers",
    ". the result can be either a destabilization of the comet s orbit or a pattern of a recurring configuration ( libration ) over a certain period of time , depending on whether relatively close encounters keep occurring or are systematically avoided and on how close to being perfect the resonance is .",
    "we already pointed out in section 3.7 that in our early computer runs the initial post - fragmentation orbital period for c/1846  o1  near 400  jovian sidereal periods following the comet s approach to the planet some 440  days after perihelion ( for details , see section  4 )  was followed by a still shorter period by the next return .",
    "since this particular timing of the encounter was instrumental in a significant reduction of the orbital period , a repetitive , long - term trend of this kind should warrant a scenario in which the comet kept encountering jupiter @xmath1440  days after perihelion at as many consecutive returns as possible . and",
    "since , on the other hand , a continuing recurrence of this configuration required that the comet s perihelion passages followed each other after an integral number of jovian revolutions about the sun , this replicate mean - motion commensurability  capable to systematically reduce the orbital period of c/1846  o1 quite dramatically over a relatively short period of time  locked the comet s motion temporarily in what we refer to as a _ high - order orbital - cascade resonance _ with jupiter s orbital motion .",
    "an _ a priori _ probability of this lock is low , but so is the probability of close encounters with jupiter ( sec .",
    "the term high - order orbital - cascade resonance requires an explanation , because two fundamental properties of orbital resonance , as usually understood in celestial mechanics , are missing .",
    "one , the comet s and jovian orbital periods are _ not _ related by a ratio of two _ small _ integers ( whence _ high - order _ ) and the integers decrease from return to next return ; and , two , the result of the resonance is neither a stabilization ( libration ) nor a destabilization of the orbit , but its period s rapid and profound shortening that proceeds in successive discrete steps ( whence _ cascade _ ) over a span of time that is only a factor of two or so longer than the pre - fragmentation orbital period .    the repetition , from return to next return , of nearly identical encounter geometry is demanded in order to preserve a recurrence of nearly constant integrated perturbations , @xmath72 .",
    "athough our reason is now different , we nonetheless require a formal modification of equations  ( 3 ) that is the same as in equations  ( 5 ) , @xmath73 except that we solve this equation for @xmath72 rather than for @xmath58 and , consequently , there are multiple solutions that depend on the choice of @xmath58 . in addition , since we try to fit the initial conditions related to the arrival of c/1846  o1 , @xmath57 is the comet s observed perihelion time , , and therefore a constraint rather than an unknown . equation  ( 8) has no solution for , where @xmath74 is a minimum number of returns needed in order that .",
    "introduction of another condition , ( analogous to that used in section  3.8 ) , may restrict the number of returns more severely , to .    calling and isolating the known parameters @xmath46 , @xmath57 , and @xmath71 on one side , we rewrite equation  ( 8) in terms of dimensionless quantities @xmath75 , @xmath76 : @xmath77 where @xmath75 is an allowed normalized orbit - evolution time .",
    "the solutions were derived by a method of successive approximations for a wide range of @xmath58 , the number of returns to perihelion .",
    "first , however , we needed information from orbit - integration runs aimed at the evolutionary scenario proposed in section  3.5 .",
    "in compliance with the proposed scenario , the set of elements for c/1973  d1 with a minimum osculating orbital period of 10430  yr at perihelion , on @xmath1614325  june  27 , was chosen as the starting orbit ( table 7 ) , whose formal errors are those in table  4 .",
    "its choice , as a product of integration of the comet s 1973 orbit back in time with an extremely slight correction to the nominal value of the eccentricity , assures us that the 1973 orbit of c/1973  d1 should satisfy any fragmentation scenario , provided that the separation velocity is added to c/1846  o1 . since c/1973",
    "d1 was a companion ( section  2 ) , the presumed parent of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 had been moving in an orbit of slightly shorter period than c/1973  d1 and required that a separation velocity of the primary be formally referred to the companion rather than the other way around , as is customary when determining the conditions at fragmentation .    in compliance with the proposed scenario ,",
    "the next step was the choice of the fragmentation time that would assure c/1846  o1 to arrive at perihelion about 264  days before c/1973  d1 , that is , around @xmath1614326 october 6 ; and , more importantly , to accomplish a close approach to jupiter 165  days before c/1973  d1 , that is , on or around @xmath1614325 december 20 . in the early runs",
    ", we searched for a solution that would satisfy the premise of a separation velocity between c/1973  d1 and c/1846  o1 of 1  m  s@xmath2 in the radial direction ( c/1846  o1 sunward ) , because this component has by far the most significant effect on the subsequent perihelion time .",
    "the first solution we tested was for a fragmentation event at a heliocentric distance of 569  au , about 1470  yr before perihelion , that is , in approximately 15800  bce .",
    "this solution satisfied the perihelion - time constraint to within two weeks , but fitted the jovian - encounter condition very well .",
    "the results of integration are presented in the upper half of table  8 .",
    "while , as expected [ cf .",
    "condition ( 3b ) in section  3.5 ] , the comet returned to perihelion in less than 5000  yr , the successive orbital periods grew progressively longer , contrary to our expectation .",
    "this solution was obviously unacceptable .",
    "since figure 2 shows that the semimajor axis is most perturbed outside the node ( that is , when jupiter is out of the comet s orbit plane ) , we considered it desirable to introduce , in addition , an out - of - plane component of the separation velocity .",
    "rather arbitrarily , we chose 0.5  m  s@xmath2 and found that the direction above the plane is the one that decreases the encounter s miss distance .",
    "integration of this solution  the small normal component of the separation velocity being the _ only _ difference  offered dramatically different results , as shown in the lower half of table  8 . while the effects on the initial perihelion time and the jovian - encounter time are only 3 days and on the initial orbital period merely 27  yr ( less than 0.6% ) , the times of the next return to perihelion already differed by @xmath11500  yr , a major trend that continued . by the year 1073 , the comet completed four revolutions about the sun in the second orbit , but less than three revolutions when in the first orbit .",
    "the enormous discrepancy in the orbital motion of the comet in the two tested orbits was caused not only by the slightly smaller encounter distance , but primarily by the fact that the encounter times in the first three passages were  contrary to the random - walk rule  always on the `` correct '' side of the node , @xmath1400  days or more after perihelion , which warranted that the integrated perturbation @xmath78 was positive , as table  8 plainly indicates .",
    "only in the fourth return the closest approach to jupiter occurred less than 300  days after perihelion and the gradual shortening of the orbital period came to an end .",
    "another useful purpose served by this exercise was a determination of the magnitudes of the integrated perturbation of the semimajor axis in these scenarios . for the positive changes of @xmath79 table  8",
    "suggests a range of 0.0005 to 0.0006  ( au)@xmath2 , which is close to an average ( e.g. , van woerkom 1948 ; teins & kronkalne 1964 ; fernndez & gallardo 1994 ) .",
    "a practical impact of this result on our further investigation had to do with the solution to equation  ( 9 ) , as the unknown @xmath76 depends critically on an integrated perturbation of the reciprocal semimajor axis in the case of orbital - cascade resonance . in figure  5",
    "we plot the allowed normalized orbit - evolution time @xmath75 and the ratio as a function of the normalized perturbation @xmath76 . to determine @xmath75",
    ", we use for any @xmath58 and employ the constants from the second scenario in table  8 , and ; we find , which gives us six different solutions for .",
    "we read the values of @xmath76 on the axis of abscissae and compute the integrated resonance perturbation .",
    "we also read the ratio on the right - hand side of the axis of ordinates and compute the final orbital period , .",
    "the caption to figure  5 describes the individual solutions in detail .",
    "the end result is that the final period allows only , whereas ( cf .",
    "table  8) allows only ; the two conditions are not satisfied simultaneously for any @xmath58 .    at this point of our experimentation",
    ", the conclusion was that if c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 are genetically related , then , in the least , it is dynamically extremely unlikely in the presence of orbital - cascade resonance that a fragmentation event occurring at @xmath1569  au before a perihelion passage in the 15th millennium bce could `` launch '' c/1846  o1 into an orbit that should eventually ( in the 19th century ) have an orbital period much shorter than about 2000  yr .",
    "we show in section  5 that , fortunately , the motion of c/1846  o1 could be subjected to greater integrated perturbations of the semimajor axis , if the fragmentation event took place earlier , nearer the aphelion of the parent orbit .",
    "that option has another significant advantage :  it needs a lower radial component of the separation velocity to keep c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 apart at the required @xmath1264  days at perihelion . as a result",
    ", it is possible to increase the magnitude of the normal component and still hold the total separation velocity at a realistic level near 1  m  s@xmath2 .",
    "in deriving the two solutions presented in table 8 , no attempt was made to bring the orbital periods closer to a commensurability with the orbital period of jupiter .",
    "yet , the second solution shows that , of the four periods listed , the best is commensurable within 0.043 and the worst within 0.120 the jovian period .",
    "the same computer code that was used to generate figure  5 was also employed to investigate the commensurability and thus the chances of high - order orbital - cascade resonance to more significantly affect the rate of the orbital - period s reduction , as was discussed in section  3.9 .",
    "for a given heliocentric distance at fragmentation , the timing of the comet s subsequent arrival to perihelion could always be adjusted by slightly varying the separation velocity s radial component , so that the initial orbital period , @xmath71 , be minimized .",
    "a very minor additional adjustment would be needed to assure that the period @xmath71 be , in addition , nearly perfectly commensurable with the jovian period .",
    "it was this experimentation that prompted us to investigate , by trial and error , the most consistent sequences of orbital periods as a function of the allowed orbital - evolution time , @xmath75 , and the number of returns , @xmath58 , with @xmath75 from equation  ( 9 ) now expressed in terms of the 1:@xmath80 commensurability of the initial orbital period , with the jovian period , @xmath61 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an integer . the nature of changes in the orbital period  especially in cases considered here , when a perturbation of the reciprocal semimajor axis integrated over a revolution about the sun , @xmath72 , is essentially constant from orbit to orbit  is such that the period drops most substantially over the first several returns after the fragmentation event .",
    "these early returns are accordingly the primary target of our interest , so much so in fact that they are the only ones over which the orbital period needs to be locked in a temporary cascade resonance to make the period @xmath83 broadly consistent with the observations .",
    "the degree of solutions compliance with such an evolution of the orbital period could be tested by the computer code via an averaged deviation of the first @xmath84 periods from strict commensurablity : @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 mod is the _ modulo operation _",

    "we already said that the initial orbital period can always be made perfectly consistent with an appropriately chosen commensurability 1:@xmath82 ; the nearest commensurabilities of the successive orbital periods , 1:@xmath89 , 1:@xmath90 , etc .",
    ", are @xmath91 when , but @xmath92 when .",
    "their averaged deviation @xmath93 from strict cascade resonance is given by equation  ( 11 ) .",
    "for , three among the orbital - period sequences that were found to be most consistent with cascade resonance ( lowest values of @xmath93 ) are presented in table  9 ; their purpose was to guide us in our effort to come up with solutions that best mimicked the orbital period of c/1846  o1 , estimated from the observations . for each sequence",
    "the numbers in the column `` resonance '' are derived from equation  ( 13 ) or ( 14 ) , and the individual deviations from the exact resonance , in the last column , from @xmath94 where it always holds that because of the condition ( 10 ) .",
    "we note that , by a fifth return to perihelion , the orbital period drops to near or below 1000  yr , in fair agreement with the period of c/1846  o1 derived from the observations in section  3.2 .",
    "accordingly , in cases like these we do not need to have cascade resonance locked for longer than five returns to the sun , with random walk variations from a sixth return on making little difference except for the condition of the perihelion date in 1846 .",
    "indeed , table 9 shows that a presumed continuation of the pattern of systematic reduction after the fifth revolution would lead to an orbital period of  yr in 1846 , far shorter than dictated by the observations .    it would seem that because of our interest in the conditions at only the several early returns to the sun",
    ", the total number , @xmath58 , of chosen returns is irrelevant .",
    "this unfortunately is not so , because the integrated perturbation @xmath72 increases with @xmath58 .",
    "the three solutions in table  9 , whose @xmath58 is , respectively , 18 , 19 , and 17 , were selected from a total of about 800 solutions with .",
    "their perturbation @xmath72 always exceeds + 0.0015  ( au)@xmath2 and is about three times as high as the relevant integrated perturbations @xmath79 in table  8 .    judging from the unrealistically short orbital periods",
    "@xmath83 , the solutions in table  9 appear to be too powerful . to correct this problem and simultaneously reduce the magnitude of the integrated perturbation @xmath95 , we next restricted our search only to solutions with , which imply generally .",
    "selected from a total of about 300 solutions , the three that fit best the conditions of cascade resonance are presented in table  10 , whose format is identical with that of table  9 .",
    "an interesting , but apparently entirely fortuitous property of each of the three solutions in table  10 is that an averaged deviation from a strict commensurability of the first five orbital periods , @xmath96 , is lower than that of the first four ones , @xmath97 .",
    "this indicates that the fifth period fits an integral multiple of the jovian orbital period better than the average of the first four . in table  9 ,",
    "the opposite was true in each case .",
    "by the time of the sixth return , when the resonance lock has been lost , the comet s orbital period is already near 1000  yr , so in this sense the solutions in table  10 are almost as openly disposed to resonance as those in table  9 .",
    "the implied perturbation @xmath98 in table  10 is by about 300 units of 10@xmath99(au)@xmath2 lower compared to table  9 , which is still a little more than twice as high as the relevant @xmath79 in table  8 .    in the context of comparing these universal schemes with the actual orbit integrations of the modeled motion for c/1846  o1",
    ", it should be recognized that the schemes serve only to guide us toward assessing our chances for achieving successful solutions to the problem of rapid systematic inward drifting of aphelion by orbital - cascade resonance .",
    "the schemes ignore the dependence on the heliocentric distance at fragmentation , disregard effects of the indirect planetary perturbations ( unrelated to the jovian encounter some 440  days after perihelion ) , and require that the integrated perturbation @xmath72 be strictly invariable from orbit to orbit . in practical integrations ,",
    "these conditions are of course not satisfied , so that the schemes are of only limited assistance .    nonetheless , the schemes were quite helpful in demonstrating that near - perfect cascade resonance conditions , produced by the constant integrated perturbations of the reciprocal semimajor axis , are compatible with a broader random - walk pattern",
    ". they can in fact extend over at least four to five consecutive revolutions about the sun , during which the rate of systematic inward drifting of aphelion is high enough to lead , at the time the resonance lock brakes down , to an orbital period that is about equal to , or shorter than , 1000  yr and thus comparable to the orbital period of c/1846  o1 dictated by the observations ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "our experimentation confirmed that the integrated perturbation effect @xmath72 was a function of the location of the fragmentation event in the parent comet s orbit , so that the significance of the apparent discordance between the values of @xmath72 in table  8 on the one hand and tables  9 and 10 on the other hand , had to be appraised by examining the event s timing .    to accommodate cascade resonance , we next optimized the integration runs by stepwise modifying the radial component of the separation velocity ( and thereby the perihelion and encounter times ) .",
    "we continued to involve , in addition , the normal , but not the transverse , component .",
    "however , solutions were not optimized to fit the comet s 1846 perihelion time .",
    "our aim was limited to investigating the number of consecutive revolutions about the sun over which the resonance lock was in effect , and to find out whether the final orbital period , at the time the lock broke down , fared well in comparison with the observed orbital period of c/1846  o1 ( section  3.2 ) .",
    "we began by assuming that the fragmentation event took place 569  au from the sun after aphelion , as in the early runs described in section  4 . by extensively varying the other parameters within tight limits , we tested the sensitivity of the solutions to conditions of cascade resonance , a process that consisted of hundreds of integration runs . at the end of this stage of experimentation",
    "we were able to bring the final orbital period down to 1819  yr , which is inconsistent with a 3@xmath28 limit ( @xmath11600  yr ) , obtained in section  3.2 from the comet s observations , by rather a narrow margin .",
    "this solution , the first entry in table  11 , indicates that cascade resonance unraveled after five returns to perihelion .",
    "the integrated perturbations @xmath72 were found to be confined to a range from + 0.000631 to + 0.000859  ( au)@xmath2 , with a mean of + 0.000796@xmath310.000110  ( au)@xmath2 .",
    "we next moved the parent comet s breakup to earlier times :  first to a heliocentric distance of 700  au after aphelion , then to aphelion itself , and then to three  preaphelion locations .",
    "these solutions , listed in table  11 , offered steeper rates of inward drifting of aphelion than did the 569  au case .",
    "the final orbital periods dropped below the 3@xmath28 limit of @xmath11600  yr to 1464  yr in the 700  au post - aphelion case ; to 1445  yr in the aphelion case ; to 1414  yr in the 500 au preaphelion case ; and to the shortest achieved period of 1353  yr in the 700 au preaphelion case , in which the integrated perturbations @xmath72 ranged from  + 0.000797 to + 0.000969 ( au)@xmath100 ,  with  an  average of .",
    "the resonance unraveled after 56 returns to perihelion in all scenarios except when the fragmentation event occurred at 569 au preaphelion and near the previous perihelion .    besides the orbits in table 11 , all derived for a total separation velocity of @xmath11  m  s@xmath2 , further solutions were obtained for fragmentation at 700  au preaphelion with a separation velocity of @xmath12  m  s@xmath2 , essentially in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "one of these runs resulted in a final orbital period of 1231  yr , the shortest we found .",
    "presented as the second entry in table  12 , its comparison with the first entry ( copied from table  11 ) confirms a modest effect of the normal separation velocity on the rate of inward drifting .",
    "as long as the resonance lock holds , the integrated perturbations @xmath98 in this high - velocity case range from + 0.000841 to + 0.000995  ( au)@xmath2 , averaging . even though this is only slightly higher than in the respective low - velocity case , the corresponding difference in the final orbital period is seen to be more than 120  yr , or about 10%",
    "to assess the significance of rapid inward drifting of aphelion for the evolution of comets , it is desirable to address the proposed orbital - cascade resonance process in terms of its orbit - changing power as well as from the standpoint of its likelihood of occurrence among comets .",
    "the most obvious limitation of the process is that only jupiter qualifies as a sufficiently effective perturber to allow this process to proceed .",
    "because of jupiter s position in the solar system , the process applies only to comets of orbital periods long enough that their aphelia are much more than an order of magnitude greater than the jovian distance from the sun .",
    "crudely , a significant effect of this kind can be expected to manifest itself only with comets whose initial orbital period substantially exceeds @xmath11000  yr .",
    "such comets can experience resonances with jupiter of 1:@xmath101 , where .",
    "however , because the effect per encounter is approximately constant in terms of the reciprocal semimajor axis , @xmath72 , the respective rate of drop in the orbital period , @xmath102 , per encounter depends strongly on the period @xmath103 itself , @xmath104 accordingly , the process is most effective for comets in extremely elongated orbits and , for a given comet , in the course of the first few revolutions about the sun after the initial encounter .",
    "this circumstance immediately leads to a notion that the process should be most effective for dynamically new comets . indeed ,",
    "if in the case we investigated in detail the comet were initially arriving from the oort cloud and had an orbital period of @xmath14  million yr , its period after the first jovian encounter would be a mere 30,000  yr , or less than 1% of the original period .",
    "this is truly remarkable , given the encounters at rather common jovicentric distances of @xmath11  au . at the other extreme",
    ", comets with periods much shorter than 1000  yr could in the same situation drift inward at rates much lower than 150  yr per encounter . among known comets with periods shorter than 1000",
    "yr there is a group of about 20 , whose tisserand invariant with respect to jupiter is , most of them with periods between 60 and 200  yr , that are sometimes referred to as halley - type comets ( carusi et al .",
    "several of them were found to avoid close encounters with jupiter , their motions subject to libration patterns ( carusi et al .  1987a , 1987b ) .",
    "the librating comets were found to be in resonances of 1:5 to 1:7 with jupiter , but because of the range of the orbital periods , there is a potential for resonances of up to 1:16 , when investigated over a sufficiently long span of time .",
    "returning now to our modeling of the inward drifting of c/1846  o1 , we started from the time of fragmentation event of the parent comet of the presumed pair of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 , assumed to have occurred at some point of its orbit between the perihelion time in @xmath1614326 and the previous perihelion passage , in @xmath1621481 .",
    "the solutions that led to the shortest final orbital periods , listed in table  12 , were based on the sets of osculation elements for c/1846  o1 at a selected location of the fragmentation event , 700  au before aphelion , in the year @xmath1618970 .",
    "for the two choices of the normal component of the separation velocity , these elements are presented in table  13 .",
    "notable are the large perihelion distances that dropped back to @xmath11.4  au by the time of next perihelion , as shown in table  14 , in which we summarize the results of orbit integration over 2021 millennia",
    ".    the orbital solutions in tables  13 and 14 do unfortunately include effects of chaotic motion owing to truncation in the computations . in section  3.5",
    "we mentioned that after four encounters with jupiter , a truncation error accumulating over 20000  yr is no longer negligible even in high - precision computations ( 17  digits ) , amounting to 1300  seconds .",
    "in addition , truncation errors increase exponentially with the number of encounters of approximately equal perturbation effects . given that the error accumulated over 20000",
    "yr with encounters absent is in a subsecond range , an expected truncation error amounts to 0.12  days after five encounters , 1  day after six encounters , and 8  days after seven encounters .",
    "it therefore appears that the resonance lock broken after  returns to perihelion was not a product of orbital nature , but was brought on computationally by truncation errors .",
    "if so , one could expect that cascading resonance might have continued .",
    "should this be the case , the results in tables  1114 suggest that the orbital period of the modeled comet c/1846  o1 could eventually get below 1000  yr , but certainly not by 1846 .",
    "we thus arrive at a conclusion that it was the _ much too slow rate of inward aphelion drifting _ caused by the inadequate jovian perturbations , _ not _ the _ broken lock of cascade resonance _ , that prevented the final orbital period to drop below @xmath11200  yr in our orbit integrations .",
    "this explanation is supported by comparison with the computational schemes listed in tables  910 . while the genuine perturbations obtained by integrating the motion of c/1846  o1 always remained , however slightly , below per revolution , the schematic sequences of perturbations that fitted the required rate of inward drifting necessitated , in the least , the rates of per revolution , but preferably per revolution , in order for the orbital period to drop , by 1846 , below @xmath11000  yr after the first four returns . if , as noted in section  3.2 , a 1@xmath28 final orbital period of c/1846  o1 is less than this limit , the examined scenario fails to explain this comet s evolution .",
    "in addition , table 14 shows that the long - term trends in the comet s other elements are likewise unfavorable to the modeled scenario .",
    "this is particularly true  about the argument of perihelion , in which c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 differ most significantly . whereas the observed value of this angular element is by 2@xmath30.5 greater for c/1846  o1 , the model in table  14 requires that it actually be smaller than that for c/1973  d1 , deviating from the expected value by about 4@xmath14 .",
    "the results are also rather disappointing in the other two angular elements , with only the perihelion distance being in fair agreement with expectation .",
    "overall , these findings support a conclusion that c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 either are _ not genetically related _ or otherwise followed an evolutionary path _ different _ from the one we proposed and examined ; in section  7 we briefly offer some speculations .      to estimate the likelihood of a long - period comet getting locked into orbital - cascade resonance , we employ a model of constant integrated perturbation @xmath72 introduced in section  3.9 .",
    "this is permissible because , on the one hand , the orbital computations leading to tables  11 and 12 show that the condition is approximately satisfied in the course of the cascade - resonance process and , on the other hand , comparison of tables  9 and 10 with tables  11 and 12 , suggests common similarities in terms of the deviations @xmath105 [ defined by equation ( 15 ) ] from exact resonance .",
    "we employed these resonance deviations from the 1:370 through 1:430 commensurabilities , that is 61 sets of model scenarios , for each of which we considered resonance spanning 10 through 19 returns to perihelion .",
    "although these numbers of returns are excessive , it turns out that there is no correlation between the distribution of the deviations and the number of returns .",
    "besides , we were interested only in the deviations @xmath97 and @xmath96 , averaged , respectively , over the first four and five returns to perihelion , as defined by equation ( 11 ) .    a cumulative distribution of the averaged deviations @xmath97 is presented in figure  6 . the plot shows clearly that in the range of small deviations , which we are interested in , the cumulative distribution increases with the square  of @xmath97 . from the definition it follows that no deviation @xmath105 can exceed @xmath106 , so that @xmath107 , the cumulative distribution of @xmath97 , may be written in the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a constant , while @xmath110 is a normalizing function that has to satisfy a constraint @xmath111 and two convergence conditions @xmath112 and , in order that for any , @xmath113 it turns out that the slope @xmath114 must be systematically decreasing with @xmath97 in order to satisfy these conditions , given the data plotted in figure 6 .",
    "we find that a gaussian , @xmath115 satisfies these conditions very well .",
    "the condition that @xmath116 be an increasing function requires a constraint , while the normalization , , imposes the following relation between the constants @xmath117 and @xmath109 : @xmath118 a satisfactory fit to the data points in figure  6 is provided by a formula @xmath119 & & \\mbox{\\llap{$\\pm$ } } 0.83 \\hspace{1.015 cm } \\pm \\ ! 0.34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also investigated the cumulative distribution @xmath120 of an averaged deviation from exact commensurability at the first five returns , @xmath96 , and found that the data obeyed the same type of law , namely , @xmath121 & & \\mbox{\\llap{$\\pm$ } } 0.51 \\hspace{1.015 cm } \\pm \\ ! 0.41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] somewhat surprisingly , at the same level of @xmath93 , the probablility of five consecutive near - resonance returns to perihelion is as high as @xmath122 the probability of four such consecutive returns .",
    "we emphasize that the sequence of solutions introduced by equation  ( 8) is quite general , not limited to the circumstances of the modeled evolution of c/1846  o1 .",
    "numerically , we find from the eight runs listed in tables  11 and 12 that an average @xmath97 is near 0.01 , so once a comet gets perturbed into a commensurable orbit upon its approach to jupiter , the probability of its motion getting locked into cascade resonance over four successive returns to perihelion is about 10@xmath123 and over five successive returns about .",
    "the probability of a temporary resonance lock is fairly low , but the likelihood of detecting a comet subjected to this process is in fact higher , because  as its orbital period gets progressively shorter  it enters , per unit time , the perihelion region ever more often than a comet whose motion does not get locked into cascade resonance .      in section 6.1",
    "we expressed a conviction that , as a driver of rapid inward drifting of aphelion , the process of high - order orbital resonance should  in the presence of regularly recurring fairly close encounters with jupiter  be responsible for the existence of long - period comets with a short post - oort - cloud history .",
    "to place the rigorously determined jovian perturbations integrated over one revolution about the sun in the context of the basic variables of the perturbation theory , we write @xmath78 , a perturbation of the reciprocal semimajor axis integrated over a revolution and representing a total energy change , as a function of the orbital elements ( the eccentricity @xmath8 , the parameter @xmath124 , and the orbital period @xmath103 ) and the radial and transverse components of the perturbation acceleration , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , ( e.g. , danby  1988 ) : @xmath127 \\ ! , { \\vspace*{0.2cm}}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the gaussian gravitational constant , and the comet s orbital position at time @xmath128 is defined by a heliocentric distance @xmath129 and a true anomaly @xmath130 .",
    "although the integration is carried out over an entire revolution about the sun , much of the total effect in the case of a fairly close encounter comes from the perturbations along a rather short arc centered on the point of closest approach .",
    "everhart ( 1969 ) investigated the problem of orbital perturbations as a result of close encounters of comets , initially in parabolic orbits , with the planets and showed that insight into the problem of an energy change is provided by a matched - conic approximation , which uses analytic expressions and offers results that agree with the results based on the exact , numerical solution fairly satisfactorily .",
    "this approximation is shown schematically in figure  7 .",
    "everhart wrote the energy perturbation in dimensionless units ; using the absolute units , his expression for the @xmath3 perturbation integrated over an encounter with jupiter , which is assumed to move about the sun in a circular orbit of radius @xmath131 , has the form  as follows : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the magnitude of the asymptotic velocity of the comet relative to jupiter before the encounter ( as well as after encounter , except for the direction ) , @xmath134 is the vector of jupiter s orbital velocity , whose magnitude is @xmath135 , @xmath136 is a unit vector from jupiter to the comet at the time of closest approach , the dot signifying a scalar product , and @xmath137 is the angle by which the direction of the departing branch of the comet s trajectory deviates from that of the approaching trajectory ( figure 7 ) .",
    "angle @xmath138 is related to the jovian mass , @xmath139 , by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the sun s mass and @xmath142 is the distance of the unperturbed approach trajectory from jupiter , which everhart calls an impact parameter . as the quantity of primary interest to us is the comet s distance from jupiter at the time of closest approach , @xmath39",
    ", we note that it is related to @xmath142 by @xmath143 after inserting for @xmath142 from equation ( 28 ) to ( 27 ) and then for @xmath138 from equation  ( 27 ) to ( 26 ) , we find that @xmath144 where @xmath145 in the limiting case , .    as an example of the degree of accuracy provided by equation ( 29 ) , we compare the approximate values of @xmath78 with the numbers computed rigorously ; the latter of course include all perturbing bodies , not just jupiter .",
    "the results , in table  15 , suggest that the approximation , expressed by equation  ( 29 ) , yields @xmath78 values that are , on the average , % higher than are the @xmath72 values from the rigorous computations .    the value of @xmath146 in equation ( 29 )",
    "can be perceived  as  a correction term , for which we find ( and ) when , that is , for nearly all encounters .",
    "equation  ( 29 ) then indicates that , excluding cases of exceptionally close encounters , @xmath78 varies inversely as a product of the distance at closest approach and the relative velocity , , confirming the well - known facts that the integrated perturbation is the greater the closer the approach is and the slower the comet moves relative to jupiter .    during jovian encounters of comets ,",
    "whose perihelion distances are much smaller than the distance of jupiter from the sun , their motion is nearly perpendicular to the planet s motion and their heliocentric velocities @xmath147 times higher , resulting in relative velocities that can reasonably be approximated by .",
    "taking now , inserting the numerical values of the constants , and recognizing that , the perturbation from equation  ( 29 ) becomes in absolute value @xmath148 given further that the averaging of the angle between  @xmath134 and @xmath136 that is randomly distributed over @xmath149 results in , we find @xmath150\\ ] ] jovicentric velocities of comets whose perihelion distances are comparable to the heliocentric distance of jupiter , depend critically on the orbital inclination .",
    "the relations ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) apply approximately when the inclination is near 90@xmath14 , but deviate from them increasingly as the inclination approaches 0@xmath14 ( prograde orbits ) or 180@xmath14 ( retrograde orbits ) , when the relative velocity converges to , respectively , and .",
    "relation ( 31 ) should for comets in essentialy coplanar orbits with perihelion distances near jupiter be replaced with @xmath151 for prograde motions , and with @xmath152 for retrograde motions .",
    "for perihelia near jupiter , the numerical coefficient in relation ( 32 ) should likewise be higher for prograde orbits but lower for retrograde orbits , compared to its value for small perihelion distances .",
    "the retrograde - to - prograde ratio of 0.17 for cometary perihelia close to jupiter compares rather favorably with the respective results of two independent investigations of 20000 hypothetical comets in randomly distributed parabolic orbits , published by teins & kronkalne ( 1964 ) and by fernndez ( 1981 ) .",
    "likewise , the above relations are generally consistent with the conclusion reached on the basis of more than 180000 hypothetical long - period comets by everhart ( 1968 ) , who found that the @xmath78 perturbation as a function of perihelion distance depends on the comet s inclination :  in prograde orbits and orbits moderately exceeding 90@xmath14 a peak effect is attained at a perihelion distance comparable with the orbital radius of the perturbing planet , whereas for retrograde orbits an inconspicuously pronounced maximum takes place at perihelion distances near zero .",
    "everhart s ( 1968 ) result averaged over all inclinations shows a slight drop in the perturbations only at perihelion distances smaller than @xmath10.4  au , but a systematic increase with increasing perihelion distance by a factor of about 1.4 between 1 and 3  au .",
    "the peak is reached at 5  au , with a steep drop ensuing at .    in the context of the process of comet diffusion ,",
    "the role of high - order orbital - cascade resonance is reminiscent of very close encounters with jupiter  the integrated perturbations in both cases trigger major changes in the total orbital energy , except that the latter mode requires no orbital - period commensurability .",
    "our computations for c/1846  o1 illustrate how dramatic the similarity really is .",
    "the peak total energy change , integrated over all returns to perihelion ( starting with those during which the orbital motion was in the cascade - resonance lock ) , is represented by the second solution in tables  12 ( referred to as the best - case scenario in footnote e ) and 14 :  the reduction of the orbital period from 7159.4  yr ( table 13 ) at the fragmentation time to the final period of 1231.36  yr ( table  12 ) signifies an integrated effect of  , which  with the values for the various parameters  averaged from the data listed in table  15  is equivalent  to an effect of a single close encounter with a minimum jovicentric distance of . from sitarski s ( 1968 )",
    "results it follows that only one long - period comet observed between 1800 and the end of 1967 approached jupiter to a similarly small distance , namely , c/1932",
    "p1 to 0.198  au before perihelion .",
    "the next three ones were c/1840  e1 , approaching the planet to 0.308  au ( before perihelion ) ; c/1823  y1 to 0.448  au ( after perihelion);0.005  au and @xmath161  day , respectively . ] and c/1917  h1 to 0.489  au ( before perihelion ) .",
    "the rate of inward aphelion drifting in this best - case scenario is depicted in figure  8 .",
    "it shows this rate to decrease gradually from nearly 200  au per revolution after the initial perihelion passage in the year @xmath1614326 to merely 10  au per revolution between returns 6 and 7 at the beginning of the 14th century ad .",
    "expanding now on the point discussed in section 6.1 , we confirm that , over an interval of not more than a few dozen millenia , the process of high - order orbital - cascade resonance could , under recurring jovian approaches to @xmath11  au , bring about changes in the orbital periods of the oort - cloud comets as prominent as a single approach to about 0.2 au of jupiter could over a span of weeks or months :  for a comet with its perihelion much closer to the sun than jupiter , the period could be reduced from @xmath14  million  yr to @xmath11700  yr , while in the case of a near - perihelion encounter , to as little as @xmath1200  yr !",
    "a statistical investigation of pairs and groups of long - period comets , undertaken in terms of the southworth - hawkins @xmath0-criterion by kresk ( 1982 ) , resulted in a 20% expectation for comets c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 making up a random pair .",
    "the expectation drops to  11% when the highly inaccurate orbits of the pre-19th - century comets are removed from the sample .",
    "the degree of expectation that would indicate the presence , in a random sample , of a nonrandom event is essentially a matter of convention .",
    "however , as a rule of thumb , a lower - than-5% random - event expectation is usually interpreted to mean that the pair s members are genetically related , while a higher - than-25% random - event expectation suggests that their relationship is highly doubtful .",
    "the degree of expectation for the comet pair c/1846",
    "o1 and c/1973  d1 is in a `` grey '' zone between the two limits , so their genetic relationship is uncertain",
    ". similarly , lindblad ( 1985 ) found that the number of groups of long - period comets varied with the @xmath0-criterion approximately as the upper 2@xmath28 confidence limit of the number of comet groups determined from searches in 20 random samples .",
    "as a statistical tool , the @xmath0-criterion appears to be unfit for testing the common origin of any specific comets .",
    "accordingly , we felt that it was desirable to explore the potential relationship of the pair of c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 by more rigorous techniques .",
    "the first step was to reexamine the orbital motions of the two comets .",
    "the outcome , in table  4 , shows that our orbit for c/1973  d1 was remarkably similar to that determined by marsden et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , implying an original orbital period of  yr . on  the other hand , the currently cataloged orbit for c/1846  o1",
    " vogel s ( 1868 ) set of parabolic elements with the planetary perturbations unaccounted for  was found to be unacceptable and in need of major revision .",
    "our work revealed for the first time that the comet s significant orbital property was a strong deviation from parabolic motion , with a probable orbital period of @xmath1500  yr and not longer than @xmath11600  yr ( 3@xmath28 ; table  3 ) .",
    "this result unexpectedly complicated the problem of common origin of the two comets by introducing a fundamental and previously unrecognized stumbling block  an enormous mismatch in their orbital periods .",
    "however , assuming a genetical relationship , the intrinsic brightness suggested that c/1973  d1 should be a companion to c/1846  o1 , while the orbital period of c/1973  d1 implied that the parent s splitting should have occurred more than @xmath116000  yr ago .",
    "integration of the orbital motion of c/1973 d1 back  in time showed that because of an encounter with jupiter , the planet s perturbations could either accelerate the comet into an orbit of larger dimensions or decelerate it into an orbit of smaller dimensions relative to those prior to the encounter , depending on the comet s position with respect to the planet at the previous return in the year @xmath1614326 .",
    "a full range of orbital change achieved during one complete jovian orbital period ( which equals merely 0.013 the rms uncertainty of the comet s orbital period ) , amounts to 0.00196  ( au)@xmath2 in the barycentric recipriocal semimajor axis , @xmath153 .",
    "the motions of the two comets would have been subjected to this differential effect if , in the year @xmath1614326 , they passed perihelion about 264  days , or almost 9  months , apart .",
    "the perturbation curve was far from symmetric , the maximum acceleration reaching @xmath160.00113  ( au)@xmath2 and the maximum deceleration + 0.00083  ( au)@xmath2 . if the pre - encounter orbital periods were alike , c/1846",
    "o1 must have been decelerated during the jovian encounter and the trailing c/1973  d1 accelerated .",
    "indeed , the pre - encounter ( original ) orbital period of c/1973  d1 equaled 7160  yr ( table  7 ) , equivalent to  ( au)@xmath2 and the approximate post - encounter ( future ) orbital period of the modeled c/1846  o1 was near 4800  yr , equivalent to  ( au)@xmath2 , in excellent agreement with the initial results of our rigorous computations ( table  8) .",
    "these initial computations were based on a condition that the radial component of the separation velocity between c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 , which is the dominant parameter determining the magnitude of the gap between the two objects at the time of the @xmath1614326 perihelion , be exactly 1  m  s@xmath2 . in order for comet c/1846  o1 to pass through perihelion first , it was required that the companion ( c/1973  d1 ) be released from the parent comet in the antisolar direction relative to the primary fragment ( c/1846  o1 ) .",
    "the 1  m  s@xmath2 constraint was satisfied by assigning the fragmentation event a time some 1470  yr before the @xmath1614326 perihelion , when the parent was at a heliocentric distance of 569  au along the incoming leg of the orbit ( i.e. , post - aphelion ) .",
    "in this scenario , the modeled c/1846  o1 approached jupiter to 0.99  au about 430  days after perihelion , in @xmath1614325 december ( table  8) , while c/1973  d1 approached the planet to 0.87  au about 600  days after perihelion , in @xmath1614324 early june .    the early forward - integration runs for the modeled motion of c/1846 o1 beyond the year @xmath1614326 showed that the initial post - fragmentation orbital period of this object was equal to slightly less than 4800  yr ( table  8) . even though this is dramatically ( by a factor of more than 3 ) shorter than the orbital period of c/1973  d1 ( 4800",
    "yr vs 16300  yr ) , it was deemed requisite that the period of c/1846  o1 be further reduced by a factor of to bring it to at least a modest agreement with the orbital period of c/1846  o1 derived from the observations ( sec .",
    "3.2 ) ; a near - perfect correspondence would require a factor of close to 10 .    in an effort to slash the comet",
    "s consumed orbital time as much as possible , we examined the dependence of the initial post - fragmentation orbital period ( between the year @xmath1614326 and return  1 ) on the normal component of the separation velocity and on the fragmentation time .",
    "as shown in tables  8 and 12 , a normal component of the separation velocity of  m  s@xmath2 led to a slightly shorter initial post - fragmentation orbital period ( by % ) .",
    "the shortest initial periods were obtained for a fragmentation event taking place @xmath1700  au from the sun before aphelion , in the year @xmath1618970 ( or 4644  yr before the @xmath1614326 perihelion ) , the minimum initial post - fragmentation period amounting then to @xmath1544600  yr ( table  12 ) , when the unlikely solution for fragmentation near the previous perihelion in the 22st millennium bce ( table  11 ) is ignored .",
    "the described rationale not only resulted in a substantial reduction in the initial post - fragmentation orbital period of the modeled motion of c/1846  o1 , but it also accentuated the merit of the applied numerical experiment , which aimed  by exploiting the perturbation effects during the recurring moderate encounters with jupiter  at repetitively slashing the orbital period over several consecutive revolutions about the sun .",
    "the urgent need for an additional reduction of the orbital period of c/1846  o1 was illustrated by the factor of more than 9 between the shortest initial post - fragmentation period of @xmath14600  yr and the ultimate target of @xmath1500  yr ( table  4 ) .",
    "the clue to this experiment s success was to temporarily lock the comet s motion into high - order orbital - cascade resonance , a process in which the aphelion was rapidly drifting inward over several consecutive revolutions about the sun , while the orbital period was successively equal to gradually decreasing integral multiples of the jovian orbital period .",
    "the solution that we refer to as the best - case scenario offered for c/1846  o1 an initial post - fragmentation orbital period of 4567  yr ( table  12 ) and resulted  after seven returns to perihelion ( even though over only first five returns was the orbital period in a resonance lock with jupiter s period in a ratio of , respectively , 1:385 , 1:274 , 1:205 , 1:161 , and 1:130 )  in the comet s final orbital period of 1231  yr , the shortest final period that we were able to come up with . this period is shorter than the estimated 3@xmath28 upper limit ( table  3 ) to , but still nearly 2.5 times longer than , the most probable period for c/1846  o1 listed in table  4 . because of the additional problems ( such as a discrepancy of about 4@xmath14 in the comet s argument of perihelion )",
    ", we concluded that c/1846  o1 and c/1973  d1 were either genetically unrelated or related in a different manner . in any case , the process of high - order orbital - cascade resonance did not explain the required rate of inward aphelion drifting to complete satisfaction .",
    "our computations showed that in the modeled motion of c/1846  o1 the peak perturbation rate , integrated over one revolution , of the reciprocal semimajor axis was close to 0.0010  ( au)@xmath2 , whereas the rate , needed to explain the final orbital period in a general range of , say ,  yr after not more than five returns to perihelion , was near 0.0017  ( au)@xmath2 ; such a rate would require [ equation  ( 27 ) ] a minimum distance of unachievable @xmath10.50.6  au rather than @xmath10.91.0  au ( tables  1112 ) some 440 days after perihelion , at the critical time during the recurring encounters with jupiter .",
    "comets c/1846 o1 and c/1973 d1 still could be genetically related , but their evolutionary paths must have differed from the examined scenario in one way or another ( e.g. , the parent s fragmentation event might have taken place one or more revolutions earlier ) . in a speculative example one may suggest a similar process , but accompanied in addition by a series of fragmentation events involving c/1846  o1 between the perihelion passages in the years @xmath1614326 and 1846 .",
    "while the resulting companions would probably fail to survive , the orbital motion of the primary would  in each such event be affected by a momentum change , arriving at jupiter at a slightly different time . as jovian encounter - driven perturbations are highly time - sensitive and capable of magnifying the slight positional changes into more significant orbital - energy changes , the rate of inward aphelion drifting might increase appreciably and the orbital period shorten accordingly .",
    "a similar outcome may also be triggered by a nongravitational acceleration that could affect the comet s orbital motion .",
    "other than that , we do not see a competing tractable interpretation  of  the  two long - period comets as a genetically related pair .",
    "our comprehensive investigation of high - order orbital - cascade resonance has ramifications for the evolution of some comets .",
    "we remark in passing that the general problem of orbital perturbations in the presence of multiple encounters with a planet was touched upon  but dismissed as hardly tractable  by everhart ( 1969 ) in connection with the now - solved problem of capturing comets into short - period orbits .",
    "although the likelihood of orbital - cascade resonance among comets is relatively low , the process represents an attractive mechanism for a rapid rate of inward drifting of aphelia of long - period comets in general and of aphelia of the dynamically new , oort - cloud comets in particular . in the context of the process of comet diffusion , the ultimate changes in the total orbital energy of comets subjected to jovian - driven high - order cascade resonance exemplify effects that in terms of orbit - transformation severity compare favorably to effects triggered in the course of very close encounters with jupiter , except that the latter do not require the orbital - period commensurability and happen instantly .",
