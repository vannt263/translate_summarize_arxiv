    "the formation of stars is tightly correlated with the presence of molecular hydrogen h@xmath0 . in the local universe , for example",

    "direct detections of h@xmath0 beyond @xmath15 are , however , challenging from the ground , and its presence and state at high redshift are most commonly inferred indirectly via tracers such as co or hcn .",
    "the fact that these molecules have dipole moments makes them much more amenable to detection via mm / sub - mm spectroscopy , but inferences about h@xmath0 then rely on poorly - known conversion factors .    because the absorption signatures of h@xmath0 , the lyman - werner bands , are located bluewards of the lyman@xmath13 transition , h@xmath0 is most directly probed at @xmath16 through high - resolution spectroscopy features from the ly@xmath13 forest . ] of damped lyman@xmath13 ( dla ) systems infront of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) or @xmath17-ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but even when probed in very high detail with qso - dlas , detections of molecular gas are scarce : h@xmath0 , for example , was detected only along 13 out of 77 qso sightlines in the sample of , while observations of other molecules like hd or co remain limited to very few systems at high redshift .    a noteworthy difference between the dlas of long ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath18 is the time during which 90% of the grb s @xmath17-ray photons are emitted . ]",
    "grbs and qsos lies within their different physical nature and selection methods .",
    "qso - dlas are intervening systems discovered in optical spectra of e.g. , color - selected qsos because of their large  cross section .",
    "in contrast , grb - dlas are located inside the star - forming host galaxy and are initially localized via the grb s @xmath17-ray and/or x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the grb s high energy emission is virtually unaffected by dust obscuration .",
    "afterglows can further be , albeit for a short time , much more luminous in the optical wavelength range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than qsos before they fade rapidly on timescales of hours or days .",
    "a proxy for the environments which grb - dlas probe is the distribution of visual extinctions derived from afterglow data for an unbiased sample of _ swift _ grbs : @xmath19 of all grbs are located behind a dust column with @xmath20 , @xmath21 30% show @xmath22 , and 20% of all _ swift _ grb have an @xmath23  mag .",
    "grbs offer thus the potential to probe environments from diffuse to translucent gas clouds .",
    "molecular gas remained elusive for a long time in grb - dlas , and has now been unequivocally detected only in the low - resolution spectra of the afterglows of one ( grb  080607 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and possibly a second grb - dla . given the very high column densities of gas regularly detected in grb afterglow spectra and their direct link to star - formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this low detection rate of h@xmath0 was initially quite surprising .",
    "because the material probed by grb - dlas is in many cases located at distances of several hundred parsecs or more from the @xmath17-ray burst , the afterglow s uv flux itself will not photo - dissociate the h@xmath0 of the grb - dla .",
    "a genuine deficit of molecular hydrogen in grb - dlas as compared to qso - dlas for example , would instead indicate that h@xmath0 is absent already prior to the burst .",
    "this could be caused by substantial background uv - radiation fields in their host galaxies , which are capable of dissociating hydrogen molecules efficiently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the incidence of h@xmath0 along qso sightlines is positively correlated with metallicity and dust depletion .",
    "dust absorbs photons in the rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) very efficiently .",
    "in uv - steep reddening laws similar to the one observed towards the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and often along grb sightlines , for example , the ratio between the extinction in the lyman - werner bands and visual extinction @xmath24 exceeds a factor of 6 .",
    "even small values of @xmath25 thus provide considerable suppression of the observed flux in the rest - frame uv .",
    "the small sample ( @xmath261015 events ) of grb afterglows observed with echelle spectrographs with a very high resolving power ( @xmath27 ) is thus restricted to the most luminous and least obscured end of the afterglow brightness distribution .",
    "consequently , the best studied grb - selected absorbers are typically those with comparatively low dust and metal content .",
    "given their low metal abundance and dust depletion , the previous non - detections of h@xmath0 in grb - dlas observed at high spectral resolution are thus consistent with qso - dla number statistics .",
    "the full sample of grb afterglows , including those observed with lower spectral resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , is diverse and includes direct evidence for metal - rich gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition significant dust - depletion factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , large amounts of reddening and strong metal lines are regularly detected towards grbs .",
    "most grb - dlas indeed show @xmath28 @xcite , which is the critical value above which molecular hydrogen has been observed towards qso .",
    "grb - dlas are thus promising sight - lines to detect and analyze molecules and their associated gas at high redshift .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0 , however , has proven to be difficult for grb - dlas : observationally , it is much easier to disentangle h@xmath0 transitions from the ly@xmath13 forest with high spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the rest - frame uv , favoring bright targets .",
    "physically , however , a significant column density of h@xmath0 is present in environments that are likely metal - rich and dust - depleted ( and are thus probed by more obscured , uv - faint afterglows ) .",
    "in fact , it required the exceptional event of grb  080607 to clearly detect both h@xmath0 and co along a grb sightline .",
    "grb  080607 had one of the intrinsically most luminous afterglows ever discovered @xcite , and was observed spectroscopically only minutes after the initial trigger when the transient was still bright @xcite .",
    "the grb  080607 afterglow spectrum is characterized by large amounts of neutral gas ( @xmath29 ) around solar metallicity , a very high dust content of @xmath30  mag and evidence for a 2175    feature @xcite .",
    "it further exhibits molecular absorption of h@xmath0 and co @xcite including vibrationally - excited h@xmath12 @xcite at @xmath31 , the first report of h@xmath12 absorption at high redshift .",
    "excited h@xmath0 absorption lines are rarely detected towards bright stars in the galaxy @xcite , but more commonly in emission in ir spectra of the central galaxies of galaxy ( proto)-clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , we detect vibrationally - excited states of h@xmath0 , which opens a second route for positive searches of molecular gas in grb afterglow spectra .    our measurements of dla metallicity ( @xmath8 } = -1.15 \\pm 0.12 $ ] ) , relative abundance ( @xmath10 } = 1.01 \\pm 0.10 $ ] ) and visual extinction ( @xmath252 ) are common among grb - dlas , and likely typical for the population of grb - dlas in general .",
    "grb  120815a thus stands in marked contrast to the metal - rich , h@xmath0-bearing dla of grb  080607 .",
    "this illustrates that h@xmath0 is present in at least a fraction of the average grb - dlas systems .",
    "the detection rate of molecular gas in grb - dlas could increase once similar afterglows are observed routinely at higher spectral resolution .",
    "similar to many other physical properties probed by grbs or their hosts , such as the distributions of galaxy brightness , mass , star - formation rate @xcite , galaxy color , ly@xmath13 emission @xcite , dust - reddening , soft x - ray absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or metallicity @xcite , selection effects play an important role when studying h@xmath0 in grb - dlas .    a larger sample of afterglows observed in a similar way as presented in this work ( fynbo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) will enable further progress in this field and deeper insights with respect to the statistical presence and properties of molecules along grb sightlines .",
    "additional detections of molecules in grb - dlas would allow detailed individual as well as statistical studies , and , coupled with host follow - up and sub - mm spectroscopy , provide unprecedented insights into the properties of molecular gas and the process and conditions of star - formation at @xmath253 and above .",
