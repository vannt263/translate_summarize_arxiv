    "much interest has been devoted to the spin degree of freedom in novel one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors , both of linear shape ( carbon nanotubes,@xcite semiconductor nanowires,@xcite conducting molecules@xcite ) and recently , of a circular one ( quantum rings@xcite ) .",
    "parameters of these systems , e.g. , average distance between the electrons @xmath0 , their total number @xmath1 , their effective mass @xmath2 , dielectric constant @xmath3 , effective bohr radius @xmath4 , _ etc .",
    "_ , can vary over a broad range or can be tuned experimentally .",
    "this creates an intriguing opportunity of reaching the wigner - crystal ( wc ) limit,@xcite @xmath5 , where electrons arrange themselves into a nearly regular lattice . according to numerical simulations,@xcite the 1d wc",
    "is well formed already at @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding electron densities are easily achievable but the presence of disorder has so far hindered experimental investigations of the 1d wc regime.@xcite remarkably , the unwanted disorder can apparently be substantially suppressed in the case of carbon nanotubes _ suspended _ above a substrate . in such devices",
    "very large @xmath7 with no immediately obvious disorder effects have been recently demonstrated.@xcite due to a finite length of the nanotubes used , they contained only a few electrons ( @xmath8 ) in the @xmath9 regime .",
    "( such systems are commonly referred to as wigner molecules . )",
    "these encouraging progress on the experimental side and a recent revival of interest to the 1d wc on the theoretical side@xcite have motivated us to undertake in the present paper a careful investigation of the fundamental energy scales that govern the spin dynamics in 1d wigner crystals and molecules .    in a strict academic sense ,",
    "the term `` crystal '' should not be used in 1d because the phonon - like vibrations of the putative lattice are infrared divergent .",
    "it is nevertheless true that at @xmath10 the pair correlation function ( pcf ) @xmath11 is sharply peaked at integer multiples of @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath12 are electron coordinates .",
    "thus , for the study of electron correlations in wigner molecules or in a group of few nearby electrons in an infinite wire the wc concept is fully adequate",
    ". once adopted , this concept implies@xcite that the low - energy dynamics of electron spins is dominated by the nearest - neighbor heisenberg interaction of strength @xmath13 proportional to an exponentially small probability of quantum tunneling under the coulomb barriers that separate the adjacent electrons .",
    "exchanges of more distant neighbors are penalized with a much stronger tunneling suppression and can therefore be neglected .        as a result of the exponential smallness of the exchange coupling @xmath13 ,",
    "the energy scales for orbital and spin dynamics are drastically different .",
    "strong _ spin - charge separation is expected to cause anomalies in many essential electron properties , e.g. , ballistic conductance@xcite of quantum wires and persistent current of quantum rings.@xcite to systematically explore such phenomena a reliable estimate of the exchange coupling @xmath13 is needed .",
    "this has been an important open problem however .",
    "the smallness of @xmath13 makes it difficult to compute even by rather advanced computer simulations.@xcite attempts to derive @xmath13 analytically ( for the nontrivial case @xmath14 ) have so far been based on the approximation that neglects all degrees of freedom in the problem except the distance between the two interchanging electrons.@xcite we call this a frozen lattice approximation ( fla ) .",
    "the accuracy of the fla is unclear because it is not justified by any small parameter . when a given pair does its exchange , it sets all other electrons in motion , too ( fig .",

    "it is accomplished in this paper , where we treat the spin exchange in a wigner molecule ( or a wc ) as a true many - body process and compute @xmath13 to the leading order in the large parameter @xmath7 .",

    "<S> these results are applicable to the case of one - dimensional wires of intermediate width as well . </S>",
    "<S> our method can be easily generalized to other interaction laws , such as the inverse distance squared one of the calogero - sutherland - moser model . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate excellent agreement with the known exact results for the latter model and show that they are relevant for a realistic experimental setup in which the bare coulomb interaction is screened by an edge of a two - dimensional electron gas . </S>"
