    "the nuclear force , a residual strong force between colorless nucleons , lies at the very heart of nuclear physics .",
    "enormous progress has been made towards its quantitative understanding since the seminal work by yukawa on the one - pion - exchange mechanism , which has been published more than eight decades ago  @xcite .",
    "already in the fifties of the last century , taketani _ et al .",
    "_ have pointed out that the range of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) potential can be divided into three distinct regions  @xcite . while the long - distance interaction is dominated by one - pion exchange",
    ", the two - pion exchange mechanism plays an important role in the intermediate region of @xmath1fm .",
    "multi - pion exchange interactions are most essential in the core region . after the discovery of heavy mesons ,",
    "the @xmath0 potential was successfully modeled using the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) picture  @xcite with multi - pion exchange potentials being effectively parametrized by single exchanges of heavy mesons like @xmath2- , @xmath3- and , @xmath4-mesons . with a fairly modest number of adjustable parameters ,",
    "the obe potential models such as the bonn  @xcite and nijmegen 93  @xcite models were able to achieve a semi - quantitative description of @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "furthermore , based on the general operator structure of the two - nucleon interaction in coordinate space , a phenomenological @xmath0 potential model was also developed by the argonne group  @xcite . in the 1990s ,",
    "high - precision charge - dependent @xmath0 potential models such as e.g.  the reid93 and nijmegen i , ii  @xcite , av18  @xcite and the cd bonn  @xcite potentials have been developed , which describe the available proton - proton and neutron - proton elastic scattering data with @xmath5datum@xmath6 .    while phenomenologically successful , the above mentioned high - precision @xmath0 potentials have no clear relation to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the underlying theory of the strong interactions .",
    "further , they do not provide a straightforward way to generate consistent and systematically improvable many - body forces and exchange currents and do not allow to estimate the theoretical uncertainty . in this sense , a more promising and systematic approach to nuclear forces and current operators has been proposed by weinberg in the framework of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) based on the most general effective chiral lagrangian constructed in harmony with the symmetries of qcd @xcite .",
    "the first quantitative studies of @xmath0 scattering up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath7lo ) in the chiral expansion have been carried out by ordez _",
    "_ @xcite using time - ordered perturbation theory , see also @xcite where the calculations were done using the method of unitary transformations . in the early 2000s , the @xmath0 potential has been worked out to fourth order in the chiral expansion ( n@xmath8lo ) by epelbaum , glckle and meiner @xcite and by entem and machleidt @xcite based on the expressions for the pion exchange contributions derived by kaiser @xcite .",
    "the corresponding three- and four - nucleon forces have also been worked out to n@xmath8lo @xcite , see @xcite for review articles and @xcite for calculations beyond n@xmath8lo .",
    "recently , fifth- ( n@xmath9lo ) and even some of the sixth - order contributions to the two - nucleon force have been worked out in @xcite , and a new generation of chiral @xmath0 potentials up to n@xmath9lo utilizing a local coordinate - space regulator for the long - range terms has been introduced in @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "a novel simple approach for estimating the theoretical uncertainty from the truncation of the chiral expansion has been proposed in @xcite and successfully validated for two - nucleon observables @xcite .",
    "the algorithm makes use of the explicit knowledge of the contributions to an observable of interest at various orders in the chiral expansion without relying on cutoff variation .",
    "the new state - of - the - art @xmath0 potentials confirm a good convergence of the chiral expansion for nuclear forces and lead to accurate description of nijmegen phase shifts @xcite .",
    "for related recent developments see refs .",
    "@xcite .    currently , work is in progress by the recently established low energy nuclear physics international collaboration ( lenpic )  @xcite towards including the consistently regularized three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) at n@xmath8lo in ab initio calculations of light- and medium - mass nuclei . in parallel ,",
    "the novel chiral @xmath0 potentials have been tested in nucleon - deuteron elastic scattering and properties of @xmath8h , @xmath9he , and @xmath10li @xcite and selected electroweak processes @xcite , where special focus has been put on estimating the theoretical uncertainty at each order of the expansion .",
    "these studies have revealed the important role of the 3nf , whose expected contributions to various bound and scattering state observables appear to be in good agreement with the expectation based on the power counting .",
    "light- and medium - mass nuclei can nowadays be studied using various ab initio methods such as the green s function monte carlo method  @xcite , the self - consistent green s function method  @xcite , the coupled - cluster approach  @xcite , nuclear lattice simulations  @xcite or the no - core - shell model  @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a first application of the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock theory to finite nuclei .",
    "infinite nuclear matter has also been widely studied based on various versions of the chiral potentials using e.g. the quantum monte carlo approach @xcite , self - consistent green s function method  @xcite , the coupled - cluster method  @xcite , many - body perturbation theory  @xcite , functional renormalization group ( frg ) method @xcite and the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , sammarruca _ et al .",

    "fairly large deviations between the results at different chiral orders as compared with the spread in predictions due to the employed cutoff variation have been reported in that paper .",
    "this suggests that cutoff variation does not represent a reliable approach to uncertainty quantification , which is fully in line with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "regulator artifacts in uniform matter have also been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this letter",
    "we calculate , for the first time , the properties of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) and pure neutron matter ( pnm ) based the latest generation of chiral @xmath0 potentials up to n@xmath9lo of refs .  @xcite using the bhf theory .",
    "the purpose of our study is twofold .",
    "first , we explore the suitability of the most recent generation of the chiral forces for microscopic description of the equation of state ( eos ) of snm and pnm .",
    "second , by performing an error analysis along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite without relying on cutoff variation , we estimate the theoretical accuracy in the description of the nuclear eos achievable at various orders of the chiral expansion .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : bhf ] we briefly outline our calculation approach based on the bhf theory .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented in section [ sec : results ] for all available cutoff values , while the theoretical uncertainty from the truncation of the chiral expansion is quantified in section [ sec : errors ] .",
    "finally , the main conclusions of our paper are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the bhf theory of nuclear matter , the underlying @xmath0 potential , determined by the @xmath0 scattering data , is replaced by an effective @xmath0 interaction , i.e. the @xmath12-matrix , which can be calculated by solving the bethe - goldstone equation  @xcite , g[,]=v+_k_a , k_b > k_fvg [ , ] , where @xmath13 is the underlying @xmath0 potential provided by chiral eft , @xmath4 is the nucleon number density , and @xmath3 the starting energy .",
    "the single - particle energy is e(k)=e(k;)=+u(k , ) .",
    "the continuous choice for the single - particle potential @xmath14 used in the present bhf theory  @xcite has the form u(k;)=re _ k<k_fkk|g[e(k)+e(k);]|kk_a , where the subscript @xmath15 indicates antisymmetrization of the matrix elements .",
    "these coupled equations are solved in a self - consistent way .",
    "finally , in the bhf theory , we obtain the energy per nucleon as [ et ] = + _ k , k<k_fkk|g[e(k)+e(k);]|kk_a .",
    "in fig .  [ snm ] , we show our results for the density dependence of the energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter for all available chiral orders and cutoff values , where the @xmath16matrices are solved up to the partial waves @xmath17 . we remind the reader that the long - range contributions are regularized in the newest chiral @xmath0 potentials by multiplying the corresponding coordinate - space expressions with the function @xmath18^n\\ , , \\quad n=6\\ , , \\quad r = 0.8 \\ldots 1.2~\\mbox{fm}.\\ ] ] for contact interactions , a non - local gaussian regulator in momentum space is employed with the cutoff @xmath19 being related to @xmath20 via @xmath21 .",
    "we emphasize that the calculations reported in this paper do not include the contributions of three- and four - nucleon forces and are thus incomplete starting from n@xmath7lo .    for snm , the lo ( i.e.  @xmath22 ) , nlo ( i.e.  @xmath23 ) and n@xmath9lo @xmath0 potentials yield lager binding energies for softer interactions ( i.e.  for larger cutoffs @xmath20 ) , while the situation is opposite at n@xmath7lo and n@xmath8lo . for pnm ,",
    "the harder ( softer ) interactions yield more ( less ) attraction at lo@xmath24n@xmath8lo ( n@xmath9lo ) .",
    "this complicated pattern suggests that the eos is rather sensitive to the details of the nuclear force and especially to the interplay between its intermediate and short - range components which is expected to be strongly regulator dependent .",
    "our results at nlo agree well with the ones reported in  @xcite both for snm and pnmlo and n@xmath8lo predictions with those of  @xcite since no results based on @xmath0 interactions only are provided in that work . ] and with the quantum monte carlos calculation of @xcite for pnm .",
    "interestingly , the cutoff dependence of the energy per particle of pnm at nlo is qualitatively different from the one found in @xcite which demonstrates that the form of the regulator does significantly affect the properties of the resulting potentials .",
    "generally , our results for both snm and pnm show an increasing attraction in the @xmath0 force when going from lo to n@xmath7lo , that can probably be traced back to the two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) , which has a very strong attractive central isoscalar piece . at n@xmath8lo",
    ", the chiral tpep receives further attractive contributions but also develops a repulsive short - range core .",
    "the additional repulsion at n@xmath9lo comes from the contributions to the tpep at this order .",
    "the eoss based on the n@xmath8lo and n@xmath9lo potentials alone show saturation points below @xmath25@xmath26 except for n@xmath8lo at @xmath27fm and @xmath28fm .",

    "<S> we discuss in detail the convergence pattern of the chiral expansion and the regulator dependence of the calculated equations of state and provide an estimation of the truncation uncertainty . for all employed values of the regulator , the fifth - order chiral two - nucleon potential is found to generate nuclear saturation properties similar to the available phenomenological high precision potentials . </S>",
