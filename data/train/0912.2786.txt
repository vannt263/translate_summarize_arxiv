    "it is well known that properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with environment in the sense that galaxies in high - density environment tend to be red and have early - type morphology .",
    "this is first quantitatively noted by @xcite in nearby clusters , and many other studies have confirmed such correlations as well as extended them in redshift space ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent large , intensive spectroscopic surveys for the local universe show that star - forming activity is also a strong function of environment ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in the sense that star - forming activity is weaker in the higher - density environment .",
    "cluster galaxies are in fact mostly red early - types with little on - going star formation at least in the local universe .",
    "however , if we look at distant clusters , we can find many blue star - forming galaxies in cluster environment ( the so - called butcher - oemler effect : @xcite ) .",
    "therefore by observing distant clusters at various redshifts ( i.e. clusters in the past universe at various epochs ) we should be able to identify when and how the activities of cluster galaxies are changed from blue star - forming populations to red quiescent ones .",
    "the hidden star forming galaxies in clusters are also key population to characterize the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "recent mid - infrared ( mir ) observations of distant clusters with space telescopes such as spitzer and akari discovered many dusty galaxies in @xmath8 clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the number of clusters studied in mir is still small , @xcite showed the trend that the dusty star - forming population is more commonly seen in the more distant clusters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed the possibility of environmental dependence in the fraction of dusty star - forming galaxies at @xmath9 , and suggested that the mir activity is enhanced in the medium - density environment such as cluster outskirts , groups and filaments , where galaxy colours sharply change from blue to red .",
    "another good tracer of star formation is optical emission lines from galaxies .",
    "in particular , h@xmath0  line ( 6563 ) is considered to be one of the best star formation indicators , since it directly reflects the emission from hii region in the star - forming sites . moreover ,",
    "h@xmath0 line is less affected by dust extinction or metallicity , compared to [ oii ] line which has been commonly used in the studies of distant galaxies . however , since h@xmath0  line shifts to near - infrared ( nir ) regime at @xmath10 , it has been difficult to conduct a large h@xmath0study for @xmath10 clusters until recently .",
    "there are some h@xmath0  studies for low-@xmath11 clusters with optical spectroscopy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and with narrow - band imaging ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the number of known clusters studied in h@xmath0  is really small . for distant clusters ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite conducted narrow - band h@xmath0   imaging surveys for several @xmath120.70.8 clusters in nir .",
    "however , their field coverage is limited to the central regions of the clusters . as suggested in @xcite , cluster surrounding",
    "environment is likely to be the key environment for galaxy evolution , but such spatially extended regions have been much less explored mainly due to the limited field of view of nir instruments .",
    "it is thus ideal to observe distant clusters in both of the two major , but independent indicators of star formation , namely , h@xmath0  and mir , over a wide area from cluster cores to surrounding environments .",
    "it is also important to quantify any different views of star forming activities seen by the two different indicators .",
    "mapping out dusty and non - dusty star formation activities in distant clusters may give us a clue to understand what is actually happening in the transition environments .",
    "in this paper , we present the first such wide - field h@xmath0  imaging survey over the known structures including the central cluster rxj1716.4 + 6708 at @xmath9 . combining with the similarly wide - field mir data of this cluster taken with akari",
    ", we also attempt to compare the h@xmath0  and mir views of the @xmath13 cluster .",
    "the rxj1716.4 + 6708 cluster ( hereafter rxj1716 ) that we target in this paper is a rich and probably unvirialized cluster at @xmath1 .",
    "the cluster was first discovered in the rosat north ecliptic pole survey ( nep : @xcite ) .",
    "optical spectroscopy was performed by @xcite and 37 cluster members were identified .",
    "using this spectroscopic sample , @xcite determined the cluster redshift @xmath14 and the velocity dispersion @xmath15  km s@xmath16 .",
    "this velocity dispersion is relatively large for its rest - frame x - ray luminosity of @xmath17erg s@xmath16 and the temperature @xmath18  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that this cluster is not virialized yet and in the process of active assembly .",
    "in fact , this cluster has a small subcluster or group to the northeast of the main cluster .",
    "the morphology of this cluster in a x - ray image elongates towards the direction of the subcluster ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite performed a wide - field , multi - colour optical imaging of this cluster and discovered prominent large - scale structures penetrating the cluster core and the second group of this cluster towards the southwest of the cluster core , based on the photometric redshift technique .",
    "the weak - lensing mass of this cluster is estimated to be @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the estimated mass based on the x - ray data in @xcite ; @xmath20 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we summarize our optical , nir and mir data . in section  3 ,",
    "we show the selection technique of h@xmath0  emitters from cluster members . the derivation of h@xmath0-derived star - formation rates is shown in section  4 .",
    "we show the results and discussions from section  5 to section  8 , and summarize our results in section  9 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 km s@xmath16mpc@xmath16 .",
    "magnitudes are all given in the ab system .",
    "we use the optical data in @xcite .",
    "we performed deep and wide - field @xmath24 imaging of the rxj1716 cluster with suprime - cam ( @xcite ) on the subaru telescope ( @xcite ) , as a part of the pisces project ( panoramic imaging and spectroscopy of cluster evolution with subaru ; @xcite ) .",
    "a summary of the data and the method of data reduction is described in @xcite , and we just repeat some important points here .",
    "we reduced the data using a pipeline software sdfred ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "source detection and photometry were done using sextractor software ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use 2@xmath25 aperture magnitudes ( mag_aper ) for measuring galaxy colours and mag_auto are used as total magnitudes of galaxies .",
    "our optical catalogue was constructed for objects brighter than @xmath26 which corresponds to the 5@xmath27 detection limit in @xmath28-band . for our use in this paper",
    ", we applied a small aperture correction to the aperture magnitudes .",
    "this is because the seeing size of our near - infrared ( nir ) data is slightly larger ( 0.89@xmath25 , see section  2.2.1 ) than that of the optical images ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we smoothed our optical images to @xmath30 and determined the correction value , but the correction is small ( @xmath20.02 mag ) .",
    "we estimated photometric redshifts ( phot-@xmath11 ) for all the galaxies using the phot-@xmath11 code of @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath31% of spectroscopically confirmed members listed in @xcite fall within the redshift range of @xmath32 ( see fig.2 of @xcite ) , and used this range to select member candidates .",
    "we observed the rxj1716 cluster in @xmath33 and nb119 filter with moircs on the subaru telescope ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nb119 filter perfectly matches to h@xmath0  lines at @xmath1 ( i.e. , the redshift of our target cluster ) . in fig .",
    "1 we compare the velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed members listed in @xcite with the nb119 filter response function .",
    "it clearly shows that we can detect more than @xmath280% of h@xmath0 emitting members within the fwhm of the nb119 filter if they have the same velocity distribution as that of the spectroscopic members in @xcite and if their h@xmath0  ews are larger than the threshold of our observation .",
    "the @xmath33-band filter samples mainly continuum flux . therefore , with a combination of @xmath33 and nb119 filters",
    ", we can conduct an unbiased , deep h@xmath0  imaging survey of this cluster . to neatly cover the large - scale structures discovered by @xcite",
    ", we set eight fields of view of moircs as shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that f1 , f2 , f7 and f8 have the full instrument coverage of 4@xmath347@xmath35 ( i.e. the original fov of moircs ) , and all the other fields , f3 , f4 , f5 and f6 , have only a half size .",
    "unfortunately , at the time of observation , one of the two moircs chips was replaced with an engineering - grade one due to the instrumental failure .",
    "we should still stress , however , that this is the first h@xmath0   imaging survey covering such a wide range in environment at @xmath36 .",
    "the data is reduced in a standard manner primarily using a pipeline software mcsred ( tanaka et al . in prep ) .",
    "some frames taken with nb119 show a strong fringe pattern , and we used a self - made fringe subtraction software .",
    "after matching the source positions on individual frames , we coadded to make a final image for each field , and then mosaiced all the images together . a summary of the @xmath33 and the nb119 data is shown in table  1 .",
    "we match the seeing size of all the images to 0.89@xmath25 , which is the worst seeing size in the @xmath33-band .",
    "the photometric zero - points are derived using some standard stars observed on 27th may 2007 .",
    "we properly scale f3f8 data to f1 or f2 using the photometry of the same objects in the overlapping regions , although the amount of such scaling is small ( @xmath370.1 mag ) .",
    "we finally check that there is no significant difference in the zero - points between our fovs using stars in the 2mass catalogue ( @xcite ) that fall within our observed fields .",
    "the galactic extinction is corrected using the dust map by @xcite .",
    "limiting magnitudes are estimated by measuring the scatter in fluxes in randomly distributed 2@xmath25 apertures for each fov .",

    "we use mag_aper ( 2@xmath25 aperture magnitude ) for colours of galaxies and mag_auto for total magnitudes . as shown in table .  1 , the depths of the data vary from field to field . we include objects with nb119 @xmath38 , which is @xmath39 detection in all the fields .",
    "we also require @xmath40 mag ( @xmath413@xmath27 in @xmath33-band ) for our sample to avoid spurious detection in nb119 .",
    "after matching to the optical catalogue constructed by @xcite , we construct a @xmath33- and nb119-detected catalogue of the rxj1716 cluster .",
    "stars and objects around very bright stars are rejected through this process .",
    "the catalogue contains a full range of information of the nb119-detected galaxies , including photometries in @xmath42 and nb119 bands as well as the phot-@xmath11 values from @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed this cluster at 15@xmath43 m ( l15 filter ) with infrared camera ( irc ) onboard the akari satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fovs of our mir observations are shown with dashed - line squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : fovs ] .",
    "it is notable that the areas of our nir observations are mostly covered by those of mir observations .",
    "our 15@xmath43 m filter captures the peaks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah : @xcite ) emissions at rest - frame 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath43 m at @xmath9 , which are considered to be a good indicator of dusty star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed 15  @xmath43 m flux ( flux_auto value from sextractor ) is first converted to the total ir luminosity , @xmath44(ir ) , using a relation between @xmath45 and @xmath44(ir ) derived from the starburst seds in @xcite ( see fig.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus derived @xmath44(ir ) is then converted to sfr using the conversion factor between sfr and @xmath44(ir ) from @xcite , i.e. , @xmath46   =   4.5 \\times 10^{-44 } l{\\textrm{(ir ) } } [ \\textrm{erg / s}]$ ] .",

    "we adopt a 50% uncertainty in sfr(ir ) , which is larger than simple photometric errors , to take into account the reported uncertainty in the conversion from @xmath47 to @xmath44(ir ) ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . using the mir catalogue constructed by @xcite",
    ", we made a catalogue of mir - detected galaxies within the fields covered by our moircs observation .",
    "@xcite constructed two types of catalogues ; one for the 15@xmath43m - resolved members ( single objects ) and the other for the 15@xmath43m - unresolved members ( blended objects ) .",
    "likewise , we make such two types of mir - detected catalogues in this paper as well .",
    "we derive star formation rates in ir , sfr(ir ) , for the 15@xmath43m - resolved members only , since there are large uncertainty in the mir photometries of the blended sources .",
    "if a line emission comes into the nb119 filter , it can be identified as an object with a flux excess in nb119 compared to the @xmath33-band flux .",
    "therefore the @xmath48nb119 colour is a good indicator to search for emitters .",
    "however , we should take into account the fact that the nb119 filter ( @xmath49 ) is located near the lower - wavelength end of @xmath33-band ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "therefore , we can not simply use the @xmath33-band magnitude as the continuum flux because the continuum flux at 1.19  @xmath43 m and the @xmath33-band flux can be different depending on the sed slope around that wavelength regime of each galaxy .",
    "therefore , we estimate the continuum flux level at 1.19@xmath43 m of each galaxy by linearly interpolating the magnitudes in @xmath28 and @xmath33 bands .",
    "this correction substantially reduces the scatter in @xmath33@xmath51nb119 colours around the zero value which is expected for non - emitters in nb119 at various redshifts .",
    "we refer to such flux corrected @xmath33-band magnitude as @xmath52 , and @xmath52@xmath51 nb119 colours of our sample are plotted against nb119 magnitudes in fig .",
    "the solid curves show @xmath53 errors in @xmath48nb119 colours .",
    "we define nb119 emitters as those having colour excesses of @xmath54nb119 @xmath55 and above the upper curve at the same time .",
    "the nb119 emitters thus selected are not necessarily h@xmath0  emitters at @xmath1 because other line emitters at other redshifts are also included in the nb119 emitters .",
    "for example , h@xmath56/[oiii ] emitters at @xmath57@xmath58 and [ oii ] emitters at @xmath59 are the major contaminants .",
    "we eliminate these galaxies using broad - band colours .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : member_selection ] a colour  colour diagram .",
    "we plot phot-@xmath11 selected galaxies ( i.e. 0.76@xmath600.83 ) as small filled circles and all the nb119 emitters as crosses .",
    "we also show the predicted colour tracks of model galaxies at @xmath61 , respectively , along which the contribution of bulge component is changed from 0.0 to 1.0 at each redshift @xcite .",
    "we can see that some emitters have very different colours from the model track of @xmath62 galaxies or the distribution of the phot-@xmath11 selected galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are likely to be contaminants .",
    "we set a boundary shown by a closed box in fig .",
    "[ fig : member_selection ] , and define the h@xmath0  emitters at @xmath1 as the nb119 emitters that satisfy these criteria .",
    "we may miss a few real members near the boundary , but their effect to our conclusion is negligible .",
    "we summarize our definitions of cluster members in the following .",
    "firstly , we select all galaxies with @xmath63 as members .",
    "this criterion recovers more than 90 % of spectroscopically confirmed members listed in @xcite ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the same criterion is actually used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the number of these phot-@xmath11 selected members is 447 .",
    "secondly , we include all the h@xmath0  emitters at @xmath1 selected above .",
    "we have 114 h@xmath0  emitters in total .",
    "note that 32 of them have been missed out by our phot-@xmath11 selection , although many of them have @xmath64 0.700.75 , only slightly lower than our phot-@xmath11 selection criterion .",
    "this is inevitable since the phot-@xmath11 tends to give lower redshift estimation for star - forming galaxies due to the lack of prominent features in their sed , while redshift estimation for passively evolving galaxies are relatively more accurate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the combined approach that we take in this paper , namely the phot-@xmath11 selection and the narrow - band emitter survey , is quite effective to increase the completeness of true cluster members .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to examine environmental dependence of h@xmath0-derived star formation activity at @xmath62 .",
    "to quantify the environment , we estimate the local density of each member galaxy using its five nearest neighbours .",
    "we already defined the local density ( @xmath65 in mpc@xmath66 unit ) in @xcite , but we recalculated it since we added 32 new members in this paper as shown in the previous section .",
    "when we calculate @xmath65 , we use all the member galaxies used in @xcite ( i.e. all the @xmath67 galaxies throughout the suprime - cam field in the optical catalogue with @xmath68 to the depth of @xmath28=24.9 ) and the 32 newly selected members .",
    "therefore , it makes almost no change for the estimation of @xmath69 from that of @xcite , but the main purpose here is to define environment with @xmath65 in the same way for the newly added members .    following the definition in @xcite",
    ", we classify galaxies into three environmental bins , namely , low - density , medium - density and high - density regions which correspond to @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the high - density region corresponds to the cluster core .",
    "the medium - density region corresponds to cluster outskirts , groups , and filaments .",
    "the low - density region corresponds to outer fields .",
    "we note that as shown in @xcite the optical colour distribution starts to change dramatically from blue to red in the medium - density environment thus defined ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "0.47 0.47    in this subsection , we calculate some basic physical quantities to characterize the star formation activity , such as star - formation rates ( sfrs ) and specific star - formation rates ( ssfrs ) , for all the h@xmath0  emitters .",
    "firstly , we derive h@xmath0  line flux , continuum flux and rest - frame equivalent width by the following equations : @xmath73}}=\\delta_{\\textrm{nb}}\\frac { f_{\\textrm{nb } } -   f_j } { 1-\\delta_{\\textrm{nb}}/\\delta_{j}}\\ ] ] @xmath74 @xmath75 } } ) = ( 1+z)^{-1 } \\frac{f_{\\rm{h\\alpha}}}{f_c}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the widths in wavelength of the @xmath33 and nb119 filters , @xmath78 is the flux density at 1.19  @xmath43 m derived from the @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the flux density for nb119 .",
    "we then multiply 4@xmath81@xmath82 to @xmath83}}$ ] to derive the luminosity @xmath44(h@xmath0 + [ nii ] ) , where @xmath84 is the luminosity distance @xmath85mpc at @xmath1 . finally , we compute the h@xmath0-based star formation rates , sfr(h@xmath0 ) , using the relation of @xcite , sfr(h@xmath0)[@xmath3/yr]@xmath86[erg / s ] .",
    "we note that our selection criteria of h@xmath0  emitters shown in section  3.1 correspond to ew@xmath87(h@xmath0+[nii ] ) @xmath530 and sfr(h@xmath0)@xmath51@xmath3/yr before extinction correction .",
    "we correct for 30% [ nii ] line contribution ( e.g. @xcite ) and consider 1 mag extinction of h@xmath0  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we should note that these assumptions adopted here are somewhat uncertain and can only be applied to discuss statistical behaviours .",
    "in particular , the amount of extinction can be much larger for very actively star - forming galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and this will be discussed in section  7 of this paper .",
    "we also note that we do not correct for the contamination of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in our h@xmath0  emitters sample . in reality",
    ", some h@xmath0  emission lines may be originated from agns rather than star - forming hii regions .",
    "however , it is reported that the fraction of agns in distant clusters is very small ( only @xmath88% ) from optical spectroscopic surveys ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". the fraction of x - ray selected agns could be higher by a factor of @xmath89 than that of optically selected ones ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but in any case , agn contamination is not a major concern and has little effect on our statistical discussion on the h@xmath0  emitters ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one of the best indicators to quantify the status of galaxy activity is the specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) , which is sfr divided by stellar mass of galaxies ( i.e. sfr per unit stellar mass ) .",
    "we derive stellar mass ( @xmath90 ) of galaxies in the following way .",
    "we use the relation between @xmath90/@xmath91 of galaxies and @xmath92 at @xmath62 for the model galaxies with different contribution of bulge component from @xcite .",
    "note that the stellar mass in the model is re - scaled using the salpeter imf for consistency with the derivation of sfr .",
    "based on the observed @xmath92 colour of each galaxy , we derive @xmath90/@xmath91 which is then multiplied to the observed @xmath33-band luminosity to get @xmath90 .",
    "ssfr is derived by dividing sfr by @xmath90 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ha_lf ] , we show the h@xmath0  luminosity function ( lf ) using h@xmath0  emitters within 2.5 mpc from the cluster centre .",
    "we here slightly modify the selection criteria of h@xmath0  emitters to make a fair comparison with @xcite , who constructed a field h@xmath0  lf at @xmath9 . assuming that all h@xmath0  emitters are associated with the cluster",
    ", we do not apply field subtraction .",
    "our cluster lf is arbitrarily scaled to match the field h@xmath0  lf from @xcite ( filled circles with their best - fitted lf ) .",
    "therefore , we can only compare the shape of the cluster and field h@xmath0  lfs .",
    "it is apparent that there is no significant difference in the shape of the h@xmath0  lf .",
    "this is similar to the result from @xcite .",
    "they showed that the h@xmath0  luminosity function shows little sensitivity to local density , using their very wide h@xmath0  imaging around cl0024 cluster at @xmath93 . in the local universe , this is also true ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite limit their sample for star - forming galaxies and showed that the strength of h@xmath0  lines does not depend on environment .",
    "thus , although the fraction of star - forming galaxies may change as a function of environment , star - forming activity of star - forming galaxies seems not strongly dependent on environment .",
    "our new h@xmath0  study for the @xmath1 cluster extends this idea up to @xmath9 . as will be discussed in section  7",
    ", there are some exceptionally active galaxies in the cluster surrounding environment .",
    "however , it would be difficult to find such excess of activity in this h@xmath0  lf .",
    "at least , our comparison suggests that we will need much larger sample to detect the environmental difference of star - forming activity _ among _ the star - forming galaxies , if any .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_vs_env ] , we plot ew@xmath87(h@xmath0+[nii ] ) , sfr(h@xmath0 ) and ssfr(h@xmath0 ) of h@xmath0  emitters as a function of local density and stellar mass .",
    "it is apparent that very strong h@xmath0  emitters with ew@xmath5100 are seen only in the medium- and the low - density environments , and no such galaxy is found in the high - density environment ( see the top - left panel of fig .",
    "6 ) , although this may be due to small number statistics of the h@xmath0 emitters in the high - density region .",
    "other than that , we see no significant environmental trends in these quantities of the h@xmath0  emitters . rather , they show modest correlations with stellar mass of galaxies ( right panels ) .",
    "strong h@xmath0  emitters with ew@xmath5100 are found only among low mass galaxies with @xmath94 .",

    "we find that high - mass galaxies tend to have low ssfr ( ssfr@xmath97@xmath98 ) compared to low - mass galaxies in all environment .",
    "the lack of low ssfr galaxies in low - mass galaxies might be partly due to the selection effect , since the selection criteria of nb emitters is more strict for fainter galaxies as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : emitter_selection ] .",
    "however , the lack of high mass galaxies with high ssfr should be reliable .",
    "we show the median value of ssfr(h@xmath0 ) in each panel as an arrow .",
    "we find that the median values do not strongly correlated with environment if we fix the stellar mass of galaxies , although the number of low - mass h@xmath0  emitters in high - density environment is really small .",
    "we should note that this suggestion is valid only when we limit the sample to the h@xmath0  emitters , and we should keep in mind that there are many h@xmath0-undetected galaxies in particular in higher - density environments ( see section  5 ) .",

    "one may claim that mir - detected galaxies tend to be biased to more massive galaxies with larger sfr .",

    "this is the first wide - field h@xmath0  emitter survey for @xmath36 clusters to date , and we neatly covered the pre - defined filamentary large - scale structures in and around this cluster . combining with the wide - field mir imaging data taken with akari satellite , we mapped out not only normal star - forming galaxies but also dusty starbursting galaxies across a wide range in environment .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows :    1 .   the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0  emitters are very similar to that of the mir galaxies .",
    "we find that the h@xmath0  emitters avoid cluster central region ( @xmath1450.25mpc ) just as the mir galaxies do , and that the fraction of h@xmath0  emitters is higher in the lower - density environment .",
    "emission lines are detected mainly from blue galaxies , while the mir galaxies tend to be redder .",
    "there are some mir galaxies on the red sequence , and interestingly , such red mir galaxies are most commonly seen in the medium - density environment such as cluster outskirts , groups and filaments .",
    "we also find that the mir galaxies are _ not _ strong h@xmath0  emitters . also , there are some mir galaxies without detectable h@xmath0  emission lines ( ew@xmath9730 ) .",
    "these suggest the existence of large amount of highly obscured galaxies in the distant cluster environment . however , we still need spectroscopic confirmation of membership of the individual mir and h@xmath0  sources to prove this interesting result .",
    "we find some h@xmath0  emitters on the red sequence .",
    "although such population is rare ( only 6 in total ) , these red h@xmath0  emitters are concentrated in the medium - density environment , similar to the spatial distribution of mir sources .",
    "we also find that many of the red h@xmath0  emitters ( 4 out of 6 ) are detected in mir .",
    "this suggests that such red emitters are not just gradually truncating their star - forming activity but actively star - forming with heavy dust obscuration .",
    "we examined the amount of hidden star formation based on the ratio of sfr(ir)/sfr(h@xmath0 ) for the mir galaxies .",
    "we find that for moderately star - forming galaxies with sfr(ir)@xmath97 10@xmath3/yr the amount of extinction for h@xmath0  is @xmath21 mag , in excellent agreement with local spirals .",
    "however , for actively star - forming galaxies with sfr(ir)@xmath520@xmath3/yr , h@xmath0 lines are more heavily attenuated and the extinction can exceed @xmath4@xmath23 in the extreme cases .",
    "interestingly , most of such very dusty galaxies are located in the medium - density environment , suggesting the enhancement of star formation activity in such environment , most likely triggered by galaxy - galaxy interactions and/or mergers .",
    "5 .   combining our unique h@xmath0  and mir data ,",
    "we derive total sfr in the cluster down to @xmath22@xmath3/yr within 0.5@xmath122@xmath133 from the cluster centre .",
    "we find that the cluster total sfr based on h@xmath0  alone can be underestimated about factor @xmath52 even after 1-mag extinction correction .",
    "we suggest that the mass - normalized cluster sfr evolves with redshift following @xmath7 , although the number of clusters studied so far is still small .",
    "we need a much larger sample of clusters studied in mir and should go back to more distant clusters at the same time , to fully understand the evolution of star - forming activity in clusters .",
    "overall , we have stressed the importance of cluster outskirts as a key environment for galaxy transition .",
    "our results also imply that we need to be very careful when studying star formation activity in distant clusters .",
    "we may miss a significant amount of star formation if we have only optical information ( even with the h@xmath0  line ) , in particular in the cluster outskirts where starbursting populations are seen . in order to trace the true star formation activity in distant clusters",
    ", mir - fir observations will be essential on top of the optical - nir observations .",
