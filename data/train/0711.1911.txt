    "recently there has been considerable interest and activity related to the construction and the computations of parametrized torsion invariants .",
    "the goal here is the development of a generalization of reidemeister torsion  which is a classical secondary invariant of cw - complexes  to bundles of manifolds .",
    "one approach to this problem was proposed by bismut and lott @xcite .",
    "another , using parametrized morse functions resulted from the work of igusa @xcite and klein @xcite .    in @xcite dwyer , weiss , and williams presented yet another definition of torsion of bundles whose main feature is that it is described entirely in terms of algebraic topology . as a result",
    "their construction is quite intuitive . given a smooth bundle @xmath0 we can consider the becker - gottlieb transfer map @xmath1 . if @xmath2 is a locally constant sheaf of @xmath3-modules we can construct a map @xmath4 which assigns to a point @xmath5 the point of @xmath6 represented by the singular chain complex @xmath7 of the fiber of @xmath8 over @xmath9 with coefficient in @xmath10 .",
    "one of the results of @xcite implies that there exists a map @xmath11 such that the diagram @xmath12^{\\lambda } \\\\ b\\ar[ur]^{p^{!}}\\ar[r]_{c_{\\rho } } & k(r )   \\\\ } \\ ] ] commutes up to a preferred homotopy . if the sheaf @xmath10 is such that all chain complexes @xmath7 are acyclic , then the map @xmath13 is canonically homotopic to the constant map .",
    "thus we obtain a lift of @xmath14 to the space @xmath15 which is the homotopy fiber of @xmath16 over the trivial element of @xmath6 .",
    "this lift @xmath17 is the smooth torsion of the bundle @xmath8 .    in order to see what kind of information about a bundle",
    "is carried by its torsion lets assume first that we are given two smooth bundles @xmath18 , @xmath19 and a map of bundles @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the waldhausen @xmath22-theory of the space @xmath23 .",
    "we have the assembly maps @xmath24 ( see section [ assembly ] ) which fit into a commutative square @xmath25^{f_{\\ast}}\\ar[d]_{a } & q(e_{2+})\\ar[d]^{a } \\cr a(e_{1 } ) \\ar[r]_{f_{\\ast } }   & a(e_{2 } ) \\cr } \\ ] ] let @xmath26 be the composition @xmath27 .",
    "one of the implications of @xcite is that if @xmath28 is a fiberwise homotopy equivalence then we can construct a homotopy @xmath29 joining @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , this homotopy can be lifted to a homotopy joining @xmath32 with @xmath33 in @xmath34 provided that @xmath28 is homotopic to a diffeomorphism of bundles .",
    "the problem of lifting @xmath35 defines then an obstruction to replacing @xmath28 by a diffeomorphism .",
    "this obstruction closely resembles the classical whitehead torsion of a homotopy equivalence of finite cw - complexes .    lets return now to the case of a single bundle @xmath0 with fiber @xmath36 .",
    "the map @xmath37 factors though the assembly map so we get a commutative diagram @xmath38^{a } \\\\    & a(e ) \\ar[d ] \\\\ b\\ar@(u , u)[uur]^{p^{!}}\\ar[ru]^{p^{a}}\\ar[r]_{c_{\\rho } } & k(r )   \\\\ } \\ ] ] if we would have a homotopy equivalence @xmath39 from the product bundle over @xmath40 to @xmath8 then the homotopy @xmath35 would give us a contraction of @xmath41 ( and thus also a contraction of @xmath13 ) to a constant map .",
    "the construction of the smooth torsion takes advantage the fact that under some homological conditions the map @xmath13 is contractible even if we do not have a homotopy equivalence @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the contraction of @xmath13 can be still interpreted as a way of relating the bundle @xmath8 to the product bundle on the level of the @xmath42-theory . viewed from this perspective",
    "the smooth torsion @xmath17 is an obstruction to the existence of a diffeomorphism between @xmath8 and the product bundle . in effect",
    "we can think of it as a linearized whitehead torsion .",
    "this parallels the way the classical reidemeister torsion is interpreted in the setting of cw - complexes .    while the idea of the construction of smooth torsion is simple to explain the technical details are rather involved .",
    "one of the main problems is that the target of the transfer @xmath14 and the domain of the map @xmath16 as described in @xcite are different and are only linked by a zigzag of weak equivalences . as a result",
    "the torsion of a bundle is not really defined uniquely but rather up to a contractible space of choices .",
    "this makes this construction of torsion rather inaccessible to direct computations .",
    "in fact , at present there are no examples of bundles for which the smooth torsion does not vanish , even though such examples abound for bismut - lott and igusa - klein torsions , and intuitively the smooth torsion of dwyer - weiss - williams should be a more delicate invariant .",
    "the last sentence points out another problem with the dwyer - weiss - williams construction : at present there are no known results relating it to the other definitions of torsion of smooth bundles .",
    "an additional difficulty with the construction of torsion as described above is that it depends on existence of the local system of coefficients @xmath10 yielding acyclicity of fibers of @xmath8 .",
    "such systems of coefficient are not easy to construct .",
    "one the goals of this note is to show how these problems can be resolved .",
    "first , we substantially simplify the construction of smooth torsion using waldhausen s manifold approach to the @xmath43-construction @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this idea is not entirely original  in @xcite the authors sketch it briefly at the very end of the paper and attribute it to waldhausen . our aim , however , is to develop it to the extent which would permit us to study properties of the smooth torsion .",
    "in addition we show that smooth torsion can be defined even if the fibers of @xmath8 are not acyclic , as long as the fundamental group of the base space acts trivially ( or even unipotently  see [ unipotent ] ) on the homology groups of the fibers .",
    "this demonstrates that smooth torsion exists for a broad class of bundles .",
    "we also aim to bring the smooth torsion of dwyer - weiss - williams closer to the bismut - lott and the igusa - klein constructions .",
    "the starting point here is the paper @xcite of igusa which describes a set of axioms for torsion of smooth bundles .",
    "igusa shows that any notion of torsion satisfying these axioms must coincide with the igusa - klein torsion up to some scalar constants . in igusa s setting",
    ", torsion is an invariant defined for all smooth unipotent bundles  the condition which as we mentioned above turns out to be satisfied by the smooth torsion .",
    "this invariant is supposed to take its values in the cohomology groups @xmath44 of the base space of the bundle .",
    "we show that the smooth torsion can be reduced to such a cohomological invariant .",
    "what remains to be verified is that the cohomology classes we produce satisfy igusa s axioms .",
    "this is the goal which the present authors in collaboration with john klein plan to complete in a future paper .",
    "* organization of the paper .",
    "* as we have mentioned above our main tool in this paper is the construction of the space @xmath45 using the language of `` partitions '' given by waldhausen in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we start by summarizing this construction in section [ manifold ] . in  [ assembly ] we describe ",
    "again following waldhausen  the assembly map from @xmath45 to waldhausen s @xmath22-theory of the space @xmath46 .",
    "while this map is not our main interest here , we will use it in section [ transfer ] to show that a certain map we construct there coincides with the becker - gottlieb transfer @xmath1 of a bundle @xmath47 in section [ linearization ] the assembly map is used again to construct the linearization map @xmath48 . in ",
    "[ torsion ] we describe the construction of torsion for bundles with acyclic fibers and for unipotent bundles .",
    "finally , in  [ ch classes ] we show how the torsion of a bundle @xmath49 defines certain cohomology classes in @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "* partitions . *",
    "let @xmath52 denote the closed interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "for a smooth manifold @xmath46 with boundary @xmath54 a partition of @xmath55 is a triple @xmath56 where @xmath36 and @xmath57 are codimension @xmath58 submanifolds of @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a submanifold of codimension @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath36 contains @xmath63 and is disjoint from @xmath64 , and finally , that for some open neighborhood @xmath65 of @xmath54 in @xmath46 the intersection of @xmath66 with @xmath67 coincides with @xmath68 for some @xmath69 .",
    "while this description reflects the basic properties of partitions we will make some further technical assumptions which will make it easier to work with them :    * we will assume that the value of @xmath70 if fixed once for all partitions ( say , @xmath71 ) ; * we will assume that @xmath72\\subseteq m$ ] for any partition @xmath73 .    in the language of @xcite partitions satisfying the last two conditions",
    "are called lower partitions .",
    "while the idea is all components - @xmath74 - of a partition should be smooth    3.5 cm     this condition is too rigid for the constructions we will want to perform . following waldhausen ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) we will assume that these are just topological manifolds but we also assume that there is a preferred smooth vector field @xmath75 on @xmath59 which is normal to @xmath66 in the following sense . given any smooth chart of @xmath59 containing @xmath76 there are constants @xmath77 such that for all @xmath78 the distance function satisfies the inequality @xmath79 this just means that the line passing through @xmath80 and going in the direction of @xmath81 stays well away from @xmath66 .",
    "0pt    the existence of such a vector field @xmath75 implies that the manifold @xmath66 admits a smoothing which is obtained by sliding points of @xmath66 along the integral curves of @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , the space of smoothings of @xmath66 which can be obtained in this way is contractible , so we can think of the quadruple @xmath82 as describing an essentially unique smooth partition .",
    "we again list some additional technical assumptions :    * we will assume that on @xmath67 the vectors of @xmath75 are the unit vectors pointing upward , in the direction of @xmath52 ; * we will also assume that for @xmath83 the component of @xmath81 tangent to the interval @xmath52 is a non - zero vector pointing upward .",
    "clearly a partition @xmath82 is determined by the manifold @xmath36 and the vector field @xmath75 . in order to simplify notation",
    "we will write @xmath84 instead of @xmath82 .    for a manifold y",
    "we have the notion of a locally trivial family of partitions of @xmath59 parametrized by @xmath85 . by this",
    "we mean a pair @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath75 is a smooth vector field on @xmath88 such that    * for each @xmath89 the pair @xmath90 is a partition of @xmath91 * for every @xmath89 there is an open neighborhood @xmath92 , a partition @xmath84 of @xmath59 , and a diffeomorphism @xmath93 such that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the projection map , @xmath96 is the identity map on an appropriate neighborhood of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath86 is a partition of @xmath59 parametrized by @xmath85 and @xmath100 is a smooth function then we obtain the induced partition @xmath101 parametrized by @xmath102 .",

    "we then set @xmath126    we note that the vector field @xmath119 does not really satisfy all assumptions of our definition of a partition since it is not a unit vector field pointing in the direction of @xmath52 when restricted to a neighborhood of @xmath127 .",
