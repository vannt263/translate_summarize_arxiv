    "the problem of restoration of rotational invariance was the focus of much work in the early days of numerical simulations of lattice gauge theories , which were performed on very small lattices .",
    "most noteworthy were the attempts to find alternative discretizations which would approach the continuum limit more rapidly than the simple hypercubic lattice .",
    "one line of attack @xcite was to discretize gauge theories on the most symmetric of all four - dimensional lattices , the four - dimensional body - centered hypercubic lattice , whose point symmetry group is three times as large as the hypercubic group .",
    "another angle of investigation worth mentioning was to formulate gauge theories on random lattices @xcite .",
    "the interest in these alternate formulations faded away in subsequent years , first because of their inherent complications , but mainly when it was realized that rotational invariance was in fact restored within statistical errors at larger distances on the hypercubic lattice .",
    "however , the treatment of discretization errors in numerical simulations of a lattice gauge theory can remain a vexing problem in some data analyses .",
    "indeed , the signal of some lattice observables , such as the two - point green functions in momentum space , has become so good that the systematic errors become very much larger than the statistical errors .",
    "a general method , which we call the h4 method , has been devised quite some time ago @xcite to eliminate hypercubic artifacts from the gluon two - point functions and extrapolate the lattice data towards the continuum .",
    "this extrapolation is crucial to succeed in a quantitative description , at least in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "such a method , despite its success in describing other two - point functions as well , as the fermion @xcite or the ghost @xcite propagators , has not been widely adopted .",
    "indeed , most other studies of the lattice two - point functions are still using phenomenological recipes @xcite which only allow for a qualitative description of the data , since it is usually not possible to make quantitative fits with a reasonable chisquare .",
    "the purpose of this note is threefold .",
    "first we want to gather some pieces about the h4 technique which are scattered in various sections of previous publications and which may have been overlooked .",
    "our second objective is to stress , on a simple controllable model , that the h4 method can be systematically improved , contrarily to the empirical methods , when the statistical errors decrease .",
    "our last goal is to point out the general applicability of the method , not only to those scalar form factors in momentum space which depend on a single invariant , but also to various other lattice observables .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section we recall the general technique of hypercubic extrapolations towards the continuum of any lattice scalar form factor depending upon a single momentum . in the following section",
    "we show that a simple model , a free real scalar field in four dimensions , can be used as a testbed for the hypercubic extrapolations",
    ". then we make a detailed comparison of the different strategies to eliminate the hypercubic lattice artifacts .",
    "the concluding section is devoted to recommendations about the best usage of the h4 extrapolation method .",
    "we also outline some straightforward generalizations .",
    "any form factor @xmath4 which is a scalar invariant on the lattice , is invariant along the orbit @xmath5 generated by the action of the isometry group @xmath6 of hypercubic lattices on the discrete momentum @xmath7 where the @xmath8 s are integers , @xmath9 is the lattice size and @xmath10 the lattice spacing .",
    "the general structure of polynomial invariants under a finite group is known from group - invariant theory @xcite . in particular",
    ", it can be shown that any polynomial function of @xmath11 which is invariant under the action of @xmath6 is a polynomial function of the 4 invariants @xmath12 } \\equiv \\sum_{\\mu}p_{\\mu}^{n},\\quad n = 2 , 4 , 6 , 8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which index the set of orbits .",
    "the appendix contains an elementary derivation .",
    "it is thus possible to use these 4 invariants to average the form factor over the orbits of @xmath6 to increase the statistical accuracy : @xmath13},p^{[4]},p^{[6]},p^{[8 ] } ) =    \\frac{1}{\\|o(p)\\| } \\sum_{p\\in o(p ) } f_l(p)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the cardinal number of the orbit @xmath5 .",
    "the orbits of the continuum isometry group @xmath0 are of course labeled by the single invariant @xmath15}\\equiv p^2 $ ] , and lattice momenta which belong to the same orbit of @xmath0 do not belong in general to the same orbit of @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , as soon as @xmath16 in integer lattice units , the @xmath0 orbit splits into two distinct h(4 ) orbits , those of the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively . therefore we can distinguish two kinds of lattice artifacts , those which depend only upon the invariant @xmath19 , and which produce the scaling violations , and those which depend also upon the higher - order invariants @xmath20}$ ] ( @xmath21 ) and which we call hypercubic artifacts .",
    "when the difference between the values of @xmath4 along one orbit of @xmath0 become larger than the statistical errors , one needs at least to reduce the hypercubic artifacts from the lattice data before attempting any quantitative analysis .",
    "the treatment of these discretization artifacts can be inferred from lattice perturbation theory , as green functions will depend on some lattice momentum   or @xmath22 , etc . ]",
    "@xmath23 instead of the continuum one , @xmath24 . by developing the lattice momentum @xmath25 in terms of the lattice spacing @xmath10 ,",
    "one gets : @xmath26 } + \\frac{a^4}{360 } p^{[6 ] } - \\frac{a^6}{20160 } p^{[8 ] } + \\cdots \\label{hatkdev}\\ ] ] and thus , the lattice momentum differs from the `` continuum '' one by discretization artifacts that are proportional to the invariants @xmath27}$ ] ( of order @xmath28 ) , @xmath29}$ ] ( order @xmath30 ) , etc .",
    "the strategies to minimize the hypercubic artifacts are based on the fact these artifacts depend on the non o(4 ) invariants , @xmath27}$ ] , @xmath29}$ ] , etc . and thus reducing @xmath27}$ ] would also reduce the artifacts .",
    "for example , the improved restoration of the rotational symmetry on the four - dimensional body - centered hypercubic lattice can be analyzed in terms of the primitive invariant @xmath27}$ ] @xcite .",
    "these strategies fall into three general groups :    * the simplest one is just to keep only the h(4 ) orbits which minimizes @xmath27}$ ] along each o(4 ) orbit .",
    "as they lay near the diagonal , a more efficient prescription @xcite is to impose a `` cylindrical '' cut on the values of @xmath11 , keeping only those that are within a prescribed distance of the diagonal .",
    "this completely empirical recipe has been widely adopted in the literature and we shall refer to it in the sequel as the `` democratic '' method .",
    "the main drawbacks are that the information for most of the momenta is lost ( for moderate lattices only a small fraction of the momenta is kept ) and that although @xmath27}$ ] is small for the orbits kept , it is not null , and therefore the systematic errors are still present . * the other methods try to fully eliminate the contribution of @xmath27}$ ] , etc . and we will generically refer to them as the h4 methods . by analogy with the free lattice propagators ,",
    "it is natural to make the hypothesis that the lattice form factor is a smooth function of the discrete invariants @xmath20}$ ] , @xmath31 , near the continuum limit , @xmath32},p^{[6]},p^{[8 ] } ) & \\approx    f_{l}(p^{2},0,0,0 ) + p^{[4]}\\frac{\\partial f_{l } }    { \\partial p^{[4]}}(p^{2},0,0,0 ) + \\\\    & \\quad p^{[6]}\\frac{\\partial f_{l}}{\\partial p^{[6]}}(p^{2},0,0,0 )    + ( p^{[4]})^2\\frac{\\partial^2 f_{l}}{\\partial^2 p^{[4]}}(p^{2},0,0,0 )    + \\cdots    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath33 is nothing but the form factor of the continuum in a finite volume , up to lattice artifacts which do not break @xmath0 invariance and which are true scaling violations .",
    "we emphasize that we are merely conjecturing that the restoration of rotational invariance is smooth when taking the continuum limit at fixed @xmath34 .",
    "when several orbits exist with the same @xmath34 , the simplest method @xcite to reduce the hypercubic artifacts is to extrapolate the lattice data towards @xmath33 by making a linear regression at fixed @xmath19 with respect to the invariant @xmath27}$ ] ( note that the contributions of other invariants are of higher order in the lattice spacing ) .",
    "+ obviously this method only applies to the o(4 ) orbits with more than one h(4 ) orbit .",
    "if one wants to include in the data analysis the values of @xmath34 with a single h(4 ) orbit , one must interpolate the slopes extracted from .",
    "this interpolation can be done either numerically or by assuming a functional dependence of the slope with respect to @xmath19 based , for example , on dimensional arguments @xcite .",
    "for instance , for a massive scalar lattice two - point function , the simplest ansatz would be to assume that the slope has the same leading behavior as for a free lattice propagator : @xmath35}}(p^{2},0,0,0 ) & =   \\frac{a^2}{\\left(p^{2}+m^2\\right)^{2}}\\left ( c_{1}+ c_{2}a^2p^{2}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the range of validity of the method can be checked a posteriori from the smoothness of the extrapolated data with respect to @xmath34 . the quality of the two - parameter fit to the slopes , and the extension of the fitting window in @xmath19 , supplies still another independent check of the validity of the extrapolations , although the inclusion of @xmath0-invariant lattice spacing corrections is usually required to get fits with a reasonable @xmath36 .",
    "+ this strategy based on independent extrapolations for each value of @xmath34 will be referred to as the local h4 method . *",
    "the number of distinct orbits at each @xmath19 in physical units increases with the lattice size and , eventually , a linear extrapolation limited to the single invariant @xmath27}$ ] breaks down .",
    "but , by the same token , it becomes possible to improve the local h4 method by performing a linear regression at fixed @xmath34 in the higher - order invariants as well .",
    "therefore , when the lattice size increases , the h4 technique provides a systematic way to include higher - order invariants and to extend the range of validity of the extrapolation towards the continuum . for those @xmath34 which do not have enough orbits to perform the extrapolation ,",
    "it is still possible to make use of all available physical information in the modelling of the functional derivatives appearing in and to perform an interpolation .",
    "+ an alternative strategy is based on the fact that the functional derivatives which appear in are functions of @xmath34 only .",
    "these functions can be represented by a taylor development in their domain of analyticity , or , more conveniently , by a laurent series , as it does not assume analyticity and makes appear all the terms allowed by dimensional arguments .",
    "moreover , it is always possible to use polynomial approximation theory and expand the functional derivatives in terms of , e.g. , chebyshev polynomials or in a fourier series , etc .",
    "+ in any case , these linear expansions allow to perform the continuum extrapolation through a global linear fit of the parameters for all values of @xmath34 inside a window at once . such a strategy has been developed for the analysis of the quark propagator @xcite and we shall refer to it as the global h4 method .",
    "the global h4 extrapolation is simple to implement since the numerical task amounts to solving a linear system .",
    "it provides a systematic way to extend the range of validity of the extrapolation towards the continuum , not only for large lattices ( where the inclusion of @xmath37 and even @xmath38 discretization errors becomes possible ) but also for small lattices ( where the local h4 method for @xmath39 errors is inefficient due to the small number of orbits ) , by using in the fit all available lattice data points .",
    "in order to analyze a model simple enough to provide a complete control of the hypercubic errors in four dimensions , we have chosen a free real scalar field , whose dynamics is given by the lagrangian : @xmath40 the naive discretization of leads to the lattice action : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the forward lattice derivative , or in momentum space , @xmath43 can be produced by means of a gaussian sampling with standard deviation @xmath44 .",
    "as this is a cheap lattice calculation , we can go to rather big volumes , up to @xmath45 in this work , and we can generate a high number of fully decorrelated configurations . in order to study the effect of statistics over the results , averages will be made over ensembles of @xmath46 till @xmath47 configurations .",
    "this lattice model is of course solvable , and the propagator reads : @xmath48 the lattice artifacts are exactly computable by expanding @xmath49 in terms of the @xmath6 invariants introduced in the previous section and plugging the development ( [ hatkdev ] ) into , @xmath50},p^{[6]},p^{[8 ] } ) & \\approx \\frac{1}{p^2+m^2 } \\ + \\",

    "but as long as we are working at finite lattice spacing , there will be corrections in @xmath28 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    "that are not at all negligible , as can be appreciated in figure [ bonefish ] which plots the ratio @xmath53 for a @xmath54 lattice .",
    "one could wonder whether such a model is really useful since the lattice artifacts are exactly known .",
    "for instance one can recover the continuum propagator from the lattice propagator by merely plotting the lattice data as a function of @xmath49 rather than @xmath34 !",
    "however this simple recipe is no longer applicable to an interacting theory where the lattice two - point functions upon the independent variables @xmath55 } = \\sum_{\\mu}(\\widehat{p}_{\\mu})^{n},\\ n=4,6,8 $ ] ( as illustrated in figure 1 of reference @xcite ) . and",
    "there is no systematic way to separate out cleanly the effect of these additional variables because @xmath49 is not an @xmath0 invariant . indeed , because @xmath49 takes on different values on every @xmath6 orbit , there is only one data point per value of @xmath49 and the h4 method , either local or global , is not appropriate for the choice of momentum variable @xmath56 .",
    "however one should exercise special attention at using this model without the information provided by expression ( except of course the smoothness assumption in the @xmath6 invariants @xmath20}$ ] ) . under this proviso ,",
    "the model can serve as a bench test of the different approaches to eliminate hypercubic artifacts .",
    "in particular _ we will not use _ eq ..    the model has one mass parameter @xmath57 which fixes the scale .",
    "we will study the worst - case scenario where @xmath57 can not be neglected with respect to @xmath11 when the lattice artifacts are large , with @xmath58 , a suitable value is @xmath59 . ] .    _",
    "the case of qcd is , in fact , simpler , as long as @xmath60 and quark masses are negligible in comparison to the momentum scale , which would correspond to the case @xmath61 .",
    "then , by dimensional arguments , the artifacts can be modeled at least in the ultraviolet regime , as proposed in @xcite and @xcite . _",
    "we will now use a free scalar field with @xmath59 to compare the different strategies to extract the continuum behavior from the lattice data .",
    "we will use lattice units and set @xmath62 throughout this section .",
    "we restrict ourselves to one or two representative methods within each strategy :    * the democratic method with a cylindrical cut selecting out the orbits that are within a distance of 2 lattice units from the diagonal @xmath18 . * the local h4 method with independent extrapolations up to @xmath63 artifacts for every @xmath34 with several orbits within the window @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) up to some @xmath66 : @xmath67},p^{[6]},p^{[8 ] } ) = \\delta_l(p^2,0,0,0,0 ) +    c(p^2)p^{[4]}\\ ] ] the slopes @xmath68 are then fitted with the following functional form @xmath69 which is used to extrapolate the points with only one orbit inside the window @xmath705,n^2_{max}]$ ] . * the global h4 methods with the coefficients of the artifacts up to @xmath63 or up to @xmath71 chosen as a laurent series : @xmath72},p^{[6]},p^{[8 ] } ) & = \\delta_l(p^2,0,0,0,0 ) +    f_1(p^2)p^{[4 ] } + f_2(p^2)p^{[6 ] } + f_3(p^2)(p^{[4]})^2 \\\\",

    "it can be seen that the dressing function of the democratic method deviates very early from unity whereas the dressing function of the local h4 method is pretty consistent with unity within statistical errors for @xmath34 up to @xmath79 .",

    "the criterion is exact for the democratic and local h4 methods which produce independent extrapolated values .",
    "extrapolations by the global h4 method are correlated and one must include the full covariance matrix of the fit in the definition of the chisquare : @xmath82 and @xmath83 is related to the covariance matrix @xmath84 .    with these considerations , we compute the @xmath85 of a zero - parameter fit of the extrapolated form factor to its known value @xmath86 for all @xmath34 .",

    "although noticeable , are not large enough to be separated from the statistical errors .",
    "three - point functions depend on two momenta .",
    "it can be shown that there are now 14 independent symmetric invariants @xmath96 under the action of the hypercubic group h(4 ) , and among them , we have the three @xmath0 invariants @xmath97 and 5 algebraically , and functionnally , independent invariants of order @xmath28 which can be chosen as @xmath98 three - point form factors are usually measured only at special kinematical configurations .",
    "assuming again smoothness of the lattice form factor with respect to these @xmath63 invariants , the global h4 extrapolation method could still be attempted provided that enough lattice momenta and enough h4 orbits are included in the analysis .    a more straightforward application of the ( hyper)cubic extrapolation method is to asymmetric lattices @xmath99 with spatial cubic symmetry .",
    "lattices with @xmath100 are produced in large scale simulations of qcd with dynamical quarks at zero temperature , whereas simulations of qcd at finite temperature require lattices with @xmath101 .",
