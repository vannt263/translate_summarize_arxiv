    "cosmological observations have become very precise . especially for the analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data one has to take into account not only first - order perturbations but also second - order effects like lensing  @xcite . for other perturbed quantities like supernova distances and redshifts as a function of observed direction  @xcite , cosmic shear  @xcite and galaxy number counts  @xcite , second - order perturbative expressions have recently been published and demonstrated to be possibly non - negligible .",
    "we need to include these second - order effects if we want to compare theory with very precise observations .",
    "their measurement is also an opportunity to test general relativity since most of these effects are different in theories which modify gravity .    in this paper",
    "we show that special attention has to be given when comparing a second - order calculation to observations . in cosmology , since we have only one universe at our disposition , we often replace ensemble averages by averages over directions . here",
    "we show that at second order , directional and ensemble average do not commute .",
    "this means that the ergodic assumption is broken by observation on the observer s past light - cone : due to gravitational lensing , observing the same thing in many directions over the sky is not the same as taking an ensemble average .",
    "the existence of different kinds of averages has already been discussed by kibble and lieu  @xcite , for the particular case of the magnification @xmath0 .",
    "they argued that the average over random directions in the sky is not the same as the average over a random distribution of sources .",
    "they showed that the ` random - source average ' of the magnification @xmath0 is exactly given by its background value  a result previously demonstrated by weinberg  @xcite  but that the ` random - direction average ' of the magnification is affected by perturbations .",
    "they found that the quantity that is invariant under random - direction average is the reciprocal magnification @xmath1 .",
    "here we extend this distinction to arbitrary observables .",
    "we argue that theoretically , we can only calculate ensemble averages , whereas observationally we usually average over directions . to compare theory with observation",
    ", we need therefore to first take the directional average of the observable and then the ensemble average .",
    "we give an explicit expression for the difference between this procedure and the ensemble average in a single line of sight .",
    "our calculation is valid up to second order in perturbation theory and in the regime of weak lensing .",
    "we apply our formalism to various observables .",
    "in particular we discuss the case of the distance , showing that the directional average of the distance ( followed by an ensemble average ) is _ smaller _ than its background value , whereas the ensemble average of the distance along a single line of sight is _ larger _ than its background value .",
    "we also discuss the case of isolated standard candles and standard rulers for which it is not so clear which averaging procedure to consider , since we do not usually have many sources at a given redshift .",
    "we illustrate the different biases in different variables and we discuss how to construct observables which minimise the bias from second - order perturbations .",
    "finally we apply our formalism to the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "we show that in multipole - space , the average over directions is automatically taken before the ensemble average .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ s : gen ] we show that ensemble average and directional average do not commute .",
    "we derive a general relation between the two types of averages , valid at second order in perturbation theory . in section  [",
    "s : ex ] , we discuss various examples and in section  [ s : con ] we conclude .",
    "we consider a cosmological experiment , i.e. an observation where we detect photons coming in at direction @xmath2 from a source situated at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "our observable can be the density of galaxies in a certain direction , the temperature of the cmb , the luminosity of a supernova , etc .",
    "we usually repeat the measurement over various directions in the sky , and we measure the mean of the observable and/or the correlation functions ( averaged over all directions at a fixed angular separation ) .    to compare these measurements with theoretical predictions we have to perform ensemble averages .",
    "cosmological perturbations are stochastic fields and only their ensemble average and their variance ( or other higher - order correlation functions ) can be calculated .",
    "the usual procedure is to assume that due to stochastic isotropy and the ergodic principle , the ( measured ) directional average of our observable is equal to its ensemble average .",
    "here we show that this procedure is correct only at first order in perturbation theory . at second order , ensemble averages and averaging over directions",
    "are two distinct procedures , which do not commute .",
    "we consider an arbitrary function of direction @xmath4 in the sky . here",
    "@xmath2 is the ( lensed ) observed direction . in an unperturbed universe , @xmath5 does not depend on directions : @xmath6 . in a perturbed universe , we expand @xmath5 around @xmath7 , in perturbations of order @xmath8 [ fno ] f(_o ) = f_0 .",
    "taking the expectation value of   and assuming gaussianity ( so that the expectation value of third - order perturbations vanishes ) we get f(_o ) = f_0 .",
    "naively we would set @xmath9 .",
    "however , at second order in perturbation theory this is not correct .",
    "when we go to second order , we have to take into account that the observed photon direction @xmath2 is lensed from the unperturbed source direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : positions ] ) , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the deflection angle , which we assume to be small . as a consequence ,",
    "the distribution of images is not statistically homogeneous and isotropic , meaning that @xmath12 .",
    "more precisely we have _",
    "1(_o)=_1(-)= _ 1 ( ) -^2_1_1()+ o(3)= -^2_1_1(_o)+o(3 ) . in the last equality ,",
    "we have used the fact that the distribution of the sources is statistically homogeneous and isotropic ( a consequence of the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the primordial fluctuations ) , so that @xmath13 . note that in expressions which are already second order , we do not need to distinguish between @xmath14 and @xmath2 .",
    "we measure the value of the observable @xmath5 at the true comoving position of the source @xmath15 .",
    "this position is observed by photons coming in at the direction @xmath16 , corresponding to an unperturbed position in the sky @xmath17 .",
    "the deflection vector @xmath18 relates @xmath19 to @xmath15 and the deflection angle is defined through @xmath20.,scaledwidth=15.0% ]    the expectation value of the second - order expression for @xmath5 is therefore of the form [ e : ff1 ] f(_o ) = f_0 .",
    "the second term in   directly follows from the non - random distribution of the images generated by gravitational lensing .",
    "this term can be simplified using [ correction ] _",
    "1_1(_o ) = ( _ 1 _ 1 ) ( _ o ) -_1(_o ) _ 1 = 2 _ 1 _ 1 , where the second equality follows since a total divergence does not contribute to the average and since the first - order convergence is given by @xmath21 ( see  @xcite for details ) . with this , the expectation value of @xmath5 becomes [ fav ] f(_o)=f_0 .",
    "let us now see what happens if instead of calculating the expectation value of @xmath5 , we first average over observed directions , and then take the ensemble average . from   we",
    "have [ avdf ] d__of ( _ o)= f_0 .",

    "[ d1av ] the second and third terms can be combined into a total derivative . since @xmath14 is unperturbed , the directional average over @xmath14 commutes with the ensemble average , and we obtain d _ = 0 .",
    "this result holds also at next order in perturbation theory .",
    "it relies only on the fact that the expectation value of total derivatives vanishes in a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe is not one to one .",
    "however , the regions where this happens contribute a negligible area for most purposes . ] .    for the second - order term in",
    ", we may neglect the perturbations of the direction ( which contribute at third order only ) so that @xmath22 , and directional and ensemble average of @xmath23 commute = _",

    "we obtain [ e : fbar ] = f_0= f ( ) . comparing   with   we see that [ e : fcomp ] f ( )  = = f(_o)+ 2f_0 ^ 2_1_1 + o(4 ) .",
    "this equation provides a general relation between the ensemble and the directional average of any observable , valid at second order in perturbation theory , in the weak lensing regime .",
    "in particular , it shows that ensemble and directional averages commute only if the variable under consideration has vanishing correlation with the convergence ( or similarly with the deflection angle ) .",
    "an important consequence is that an observable whose ensemble average is invariant under second - order perturbations ( like for example the magnification @xmath0 , see  @xcite ) will automatically receive corrections when we take its directional average ( and vice - versa ) .    in practice ,",
    "if we measure a directional average , @xmath24 , the ensemble average which we have to compare our measurements with is @xmath25 .",
    "however , if we measure just one realisation @xmath4 in a fixed observed direction @xmath2 , we should compare our measurements with @xmath26 .    before we discuss important examples ,",
    "let us also note the following : if we observe a power of @xmath5 , say @xmath27 , a taylor expansion up to second order yields f^p ( ) = & = & f_0^p , [ e : p2 ] + f^p ( _ o)&= & f_0^p .[e : p1 ] it follows that , choosing @xmath28 , we can avoid second - order corrections to @xmath29 , while choosing @xmath30 we can avoid second - order corrections to @xmath31 .",
    "hence there is an optimal power of a given variable which removes corrections to the mean at second order .",
    "more generally , for an arbitrary function @xmath32 we obtain [ e : fmean ] f(f ( ) ) = & = & f(f_0 ) + + o(4 ) , + [ e : fens ] f(f ( _ o ) ) & = & f(f_0 ) + + o(4 ) . hence choosing @xmath33 avoids contributions from second - order perturbations to the mean over directions , @xmath34 , while choosing @xmath35 avoids second - order contributions to @xmath36 .",
    "we consider various examples and show explicitly how the two averaging procedures lead to different contributions from second - order perturbations .      the angular diameter distance up to",
    "second - order has been fully calculated in  @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the dominant second - order terms : we want to know what is the maximum impact that second - order contributions can have on the mean distance .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , this means that we need to take into account only the terms with the maximal number of transverse derivatives .",
    "we can neglect contributions proportional to the gravitational potential and its time and radial derivatives , relative to transverse derivative of the gravitational potential : , _ t , _",
    "r_a , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are orthogonal to the photon propagation @xmath2 .",
    "we calculate the angular diameter distance up to second order with these simplifications .",
    "here we just present the result , the detailed calculation is given in  @xcite .",
    "the angular diameter distance is given by the determinant of the 2x2 magnification matrix @xmath39 , defined as can be calculated in a non - expanding universe .",
    "for an expanding universe , we multiply @xmath40 by the scale factor @xmath41 ( see appendix a of  @xcite ) , which we rewrite as @xmath42 since perturbations in the redshift are negligible relative to the terms with four transverse derivatives . ] [ e : dab ] d_ab= _ a_b= (    cc1 - -^(1)&-^(2)- + -^(2)+ & 1-+^(1 )    ) , where @xmath43 is a curl component which vanishes at first order , @xmath44 is the convergence and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the shear components ( from now on , we absorb the smallness parameter @xmath8 in the perturbation variables ) .",
    "the magnification matrix obeys a second - order differential equation , which can be solved order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "the angular diameter distance is given by [ e : da2 ] d_a^2 , where @xmath47 and we have neglected @xmath48 which is of order 4 in perturbation theory . we have also set @xmath49 , i.e. we neglect the perturbations of the affine parameter which contain less transverse derivatives than the deflection angle ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote respectively the conformal time today and at the source position .",
    "expanding @xmath52 to second order , @xmath53 , and taking the square root of ( [ e : da2 ] ) , [ e : dagen ] d_a = d_0= d_0 , where @xmath54 is the background distance ( recall that we neglect perturbations in the redshift , which contain less transverse derivatives and are therefore subdominant ) . as @xmath55 enters squared , we need it only to first order , @xmath56 .",
    "we are interested in the average of @xmath57 .",
    "as demonstrated in  @xcite , the second - order convergence @xmath58 can be written as a total divergence , so it does not contribute : both the ensemble average and the directional average of @xmath58 vanish : _",
    "2 = = 0 . furthermore ,",
    "as we show in  @xcite , the combination @xmath59 is also a total divergence , so that _ 1 ^ 2-|_1|^2 = = 0 .",
    "if we take the ensemble average of the directional average , we obtain therefore [ dadir ] = d_a ( ) = d_0(1 -_1 ^ 2 ) .",
    "this shows that lensing _ decreases the directional average _ of the distance with respect to the background value  @xmath60 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we calculate the ensemble average of the distance , we have a remaining second - order term given by  . combining this second - order term with the first - order square , we obtain [ daexp ] d_a(_o)=d_0(1+_1 ^ 2 ) .",
    "this is the result discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it shows that lensing _ increases the ensemble average _ of the distance with respect to the background value @xmath60 .",
    "the difference between and   can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "if we consider many realisations of a random but fixed line of sight , the fact that there are structures between the source and the observer will , on average , increase the distance .",
    "this means that structures generate with higher probability a de - focusing on a random line of sight .",
    "however , if we average the distance over directions , under - densities which lead to de - focusing are competing with over - densities which lead to focusing .",
    "since lensing also changes the distribution of lines of sight within a given solid angle , the contribution from under - densities does not exactly cancel the contribution from over - densities . on average",
    ", the latter dominates , leading to a decrease of the distance .    taking an arbitrary power of @xmath57 to second order and making use of ( [ e : p2 ] ) and ( [ e : p1 ] ) , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 divergence",
    ", we obtain d_a^p()= & = & d_0^p , [ dadirp ] + d_a^p(_o ) & = & d_0^p .",
    "this shows that the ensemble average of @xmath63 experiences no second - order corrections for @xmath64 , while the ensemble average of the mean over directions of @xmath63 experiences no second - order corrections for @xmath65 .",
    "these results are completely consistent with  @xcite , noting that @xmath66",
    ". the background distance is then given by d_0==^1/p .",
    "from these results we can also calculate the observed angular sizes of standard objects on the sky determined via @xmath67 here @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the standard area and standard length , and we have used ( [ e : fbar ] ) , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "only one of these is invariant : the expectation value of the angular size of a ` standard area ' .",
    "any standard _ ruler _ , whether averaged over directions or not , will receive corrections .",
    "the observables discussed here are all affected by the square of the convergence @xmath71 . the main contribution to @xmath71",
    "can be calculated using the limber approximation : _ 1 ^ 2&=&^24_=0^^2_0^d g^2( ) ( p_0 t^2)(k= ) , where @xmath72 is the angular laplacian , @xmath73 is the transfer function , @xmath74 is the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational potential and @xmath75 is the growth factor ( see  @xcite for more detail ) . figure  [ fig : kappasquare ] shows @xmath71 as a function of redshift for different values of cosmological parameters . at the last scattering surface , @xmath76",
    ", @xmath71 reaches 0.6 percent .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath77 comes from terms with 4 transverse derivatives , shown here for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "higher @xmath81 damps small - scale power below 100mpc through silk damping , resulting in a smaller @xmath77 .",
    "at @xmath76 an approximate dependence on model parameters is @xmath82 .",
    "note that here we have used the linear power spectrum to calculate @xmath71 . at high redshift ,",
    "this is a good approximation , but at low redshift the linear expression underestimates the effect.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the discussion above , we have considered only the perturbations with four transverse derivatives of the gravitational potential .",
    "a crucial consequence is that in this case , the second - order convergence @xmath58 can be written as a total divergence , which vanishes on average .",
    "the only remaining contribution is therefore the square of the first - order convergence @xmath71 .",
    "however , the full relativistic expression for the distance contains also second - order terms with two transverse derivatives of the gravitational potential and second - order terms with no transverse derivatives  @xcite .",
    "the terms with no transverse derivatives are for example due to the integrated sachs - wolfe or the shapiro time delay .",
    "these terms change the physical length of the photon geodesic between the source and the observer .",
    "they do not vanish on average and they affect therefore the mean distance to the source .",
    "their amplitude is however of the order of the square of the gravitational potential , @xmath83 , i.e. much smaller than the first - order convergence square in and .",
    "in addition to the isw and the shapiro time delay , the distance receives also corrections from the doppler terms .",
    "the square of the velocity is of the order @xmath84 and the doppler terms are therefore relevant only at very low redshift @xmath85 .",
    "the terms with two transverse derivatives describe a coupling between the longitudinal and transverse deflections . for example , some of these terms are due to the fact that we average the distance over directions @xmath2 at a fixed value of the redshift . since the redshift is itself perturbed , @xmath86 , we obtain contributions proportional to d_a(z_0+z,_o)~d_a(z_0,_o)z ~d_0 _ 1 , i.e. contributions due to the fact that the distance is integrated on a perturbed surface , at a fixed redshift from the observer . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : kappasquare ] , @xmath71 reaches @xmath87 at very large redshift .",
    "the terms with two transverse derivatives are therefore roughly of the order @xmath88 .",
    "it is therefore also justified to neglect these types of terms relative to the square of the convergence .",
    "finally , let us mention that the distance contains also first - order contributions proportional to the gravitational potential at the observer , @xmath89 , and to the peculiar velocity at the observer , @xmath90 .",
    "whereas the velocity term vanishes under directional average , the potential term remains and contributes at the order of @xmath91 .",
    "this contribution is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath71 at high redshift .",
    "below redshift 1 however , where @xmath71 is much smaller , this contribution may be relevant ( see  @xcite for a detailed analysis of the impact of this term on supernovae measurements ) .      for a standard(-izable ) candle such as a type ia supernova ,",
    "the relevant quantities are not the geometrical variables angle and area distance , but rather the flux of photons at the observer and the luminosity distance .",
    "observers typically plot the distance modulus @xmath92 to a supernova at redshift @xmath3 of observed magnitude @xmath93 and true magnitude @xmath94 , inferred via the observed flux @xmath95 and defined as follows , should not be confused with the lensing magnification @xmath0 .",

    "[ e : mu ] here @xmath3 is the redshift of the supernova ( we neglect its perturbation which is justified only for @xmath96 , see  @xcite ) , and @xmath97 is its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "observers usually do not have many supernovae with the same redshift in different directions .",
    "therefore , they directly fit the observed curve @xmath98 to the corresponding curve for some background cosmology , without taking into account perturbations .",
    "first - order perturbations to the distance have been discussed and taken into account as a systematic error  @xcite . here",
    "we discuss a shift of the mean value due to second - order fluctuations .",
    "we concentrate on redshifts @xmath99 .",
    "the effect on the hubble constant from close - by supernovae with @xmath100 is discussed in  @xcite .",

    "m(z)&=&_m0(z)-5_1-(_2+_1 ^ 2 + |_1|^2 ) .",
    "the impact of second - order lensing on supernovae measurements then really depends on how observations are performed .",
    "if the observed flux of each supernova is directly compared with the intrinsic luminosity to extract the luminosity distance , then the relevant quantity is the expectation value of the flux .",
    "this is unaffected by second - order lensing , since @xmath102 and @xmath103 : f(_o)=f_0 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the distance modulus @xmath104 is used directly to extract the luminosity distance , then second - order lensing will systematically increase the expectation value _ m(z,_o)= _ m0(z ) + 5_1 ^ 2 , leading to an overestimate of the distance @xmath105 .",
    "considering fig .",
    "[ fig : kappasquare ] , we find that for @xmath106 the shift in @xmath104 is less than 0.003 and therefore will produce a shift in the dark energy equation of state around the percent level .",
    "however , since it is a shift with a definite sign leading to a slight overestimation of @xmath104 and hence of supernovae distances , this can bias parameter estimation if not taken into account .",
    "the discussion above assumes that the luminosity distance is extracted individually from each supernova .",
    "if the sample is large enough , one can instead split the supernovae into @xmath107 bins of redshift and average the observed flux over all supernovae in the same bin .",
    "this average can be considered as an approximate angular average , or equivalently expectation over true source positions ( per redshift bin ) for fixed size angular patches : [ eq : flux ] _",
    "i=1^nf_i(z,_o^i)=_i=1^nf_i(z,_o^i)__o = f(z,)=f_0(z)(1 + 4_1 ^ 2 ) , where we used .",
    "we see that in this case the observed flux is increased by second - order lensing , leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance .",
    "hence even though averaging over supernovae in the same redshift bin has the advantage of decreasing the statistically uncertainty in the measurement of the flux , it has the disadvantage of introducing a systematic bias in the luminosity distance .",
    "this bias is also present if we average the distance modulus & = & _ m0(z ) -5_1 ^ 2 , and the distance is also underestimated in this case . from we see that to fully exploit the potential of averaging over bins of redshift , without introducing any additional bias , we need to first extract the square of the luminosity distance for each supernova in the bin , and then take an average = d^2_l0 .    finally , let us note that in practice , since supernovae are not perfect standard candles , their intrinsic luminosity is calibrated on a training subset , for which both the flux and the distance are known . from this subset",
    "a relation between the intrinsic ( peak ) luminosity and the shape of the light - curve ( for example its width ) is derived  @xcite .",
    "this relation is then used to determine the intrinsic luminosity of the other supernovae .",
    "one can then wonder whether this relation is affected by second - order lensing , leading to a systematic bias in the determination of the intrinsic luminosity and consequently to an error in the distance measurements .",
    "this is fortunately not the case . indeed , in the training subset , both the distance and the flux are affected in a consistent way by lensing ( following and ) , leaving the intrinsic luminosity unchanged l=4d_l^2",
    "f=4d_l0 ^ 2f_0=l_0 .",
    "the shape of the light - curve is also unaffected , since lensing is not expected to vary during the time - scale of the supernova explosion . as a consequence ,",
    "lensing can induce a constant shift in the amplitude of the light - curve , but it can not generate a change in the shape .",
    "therefore the relation between the shape of the light - curve and the intrinsic luminosity inferred from the training subset is not biased by second - order lensing .      as a last example , we discuss what happens with the cmb . in  @xcite , we calculated the contribution of the shear and the convergence to the angular power spectrum of the cmb , up to second order in perturbation theory .",
    "we found that the lensed power spectrum @xmath108 , calculated for a constant magnification matrix , is related to the unlensed power spectrum @xmath109 through [ dl ] d()=d()+d ( ) + ^2 d ",
    "if we take a directional average of , as we do in  @xcite , i.e. we average the shear and convergence over different parts of the sky , we obtain [ dlavfin ] = d()+_1 ^ 2d ( ) + _ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 d  ( ) . if instead we take an ensemble average , i.e. we average over all possible realisations of the shear and convergence fields , we obtain [ dlavexp ] d ( ) = d()-_1 ^ 2d()+_1 ^ 2 ^ 2 d  ( ) . the smoothing term @xmath110 is the same in the two cases : it shows that lensing decreases the amplitude of the peaks .",
    "the pure displacement term @xmath111 on the other hand is different : it is positive if we take a directional average but negative if we take an ensemble average .",
    "this is completely equivalent to the effect on the distance described in section  [ sec : distance ] : the ensemble average of the distance is increased whereas the directional average is decreased . since the cmb is averaged over directions , the correct averaging procedure is given by , leading to a shift of the peaks to lower multipoles . as discussed in detail in  @xcite , this shift is consistently included in standard boltzmann codes ( such as camb  @xcite or class  @xcite ) , since it is due to the square of the first - order convergence .",
    "the only term in neglected by current cmb analyses is the contribution from the second - order convergence @xmath58 .",
    "however , as already mentioned before , the dominant terms in @xmath58 ( those with 4 transverse derivatives ) vanish on average , and the subdominant terms are negligible , roughly @xmath112 times smaller than the first - order convergence square ( see discussion at the end of section  [ sec : distance ] ) .",
    "finally , let us mention that the standard way of calculating the cmb angular power spectrum is not through   but rather through a calculation of the lensed multipoles @xmath113 .",
    "this calculation automatically selects the correct averaging procedure since the @xmath113 are defined through a ( weighted ) average over directions a_m",
    "= d__oy_m(_o)t(_o ) .",
    "the angular power spectrum is given by a_ma_",
    "m = c___mm .",
    "the ensemble average is therefore automatically taken _",
    "after _ the integral over directions .",
    "in this paper we have shown that at second order in perturbation theory , averaging over the observed directions and taking an ensemble average are two distinct procedures , which do not commute .",
    "this comes from the fact that the observed direction is lensed  hence it is itself perturbed  and its perturbation may well be correlated with the observable under consideration .",
    "this is especially relevant for distance measurements , the perturbations of which are intimately related to lensing . in particular , we have shown that the distance to the last scattering surface is decreased by lensing if one takes an average over directions , whereas it is increased if one takes an ensemble average . in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we argue that the directional average is relevant for cmb observations and that consequently second - order lensing shifts the position of the peaks to lower multipoles .",
    "however , as we showed there , the change in the distance captures the essence of the change to the peaks but does not accurately capture the shift or damping of the peaks .",
    "consequently , the cmb sound horizon does not act as a standard ruler when lensing is present .    for the analysis of diffuse observables like the cmb ( actually also the bao s ) , correlation functions are calculated and fitted to the model . moreover , in multipole space , the average over directions is always taken before the ensemble average , and no ambiguity arises concerning the averaging procedure . for standard rulers and candles which are point sources",
    ", it is much more subtle to remove the bias arising from lensing in going from the observable to the model , and the distance measure chosen must be carefully understood . in particular , the notion of standard ruler should be extended to a standard area as the expectation value of an observed solid angle is preserved under lensing , which is not the case for an observed linear angle .",
    "we have also shown that for specific observables there exist functions which do not acquire corrections from second - order perturbations .",
    "it is therefore a good observational strategy to consider these functions of the observables in order to avoid systematic errors from second - order perturbations .",

    "<S> we show that at second order , ensemble averages of observables and directional averages do not commute due to gravitational lensing  observing the same thing in many directions over the sky is not the same as taking an ensemble average . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this non - commutativity is significant for a variety of quantities that we often use as observables and can lead to a bias in parameter estimation . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the relation between the ensemble average and the directional average of an observable , at second order in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance of these two types of averages for making predictions of cosmological observables , focusing on observables related to distances and magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the ensemble average of the distance in a given observed direction is increased by gravitational lensing , whereas the directional average of the distance is decreased . for a generic observable , there exists a particular function of the observable that is not affected by second - order lensing perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that standard areas have an advantage over standard rulers , and we discuss the subtleties involved in averaging in the case of supernova observations . </S>"
