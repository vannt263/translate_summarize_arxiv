    "<S> \\1 ) the electronic transport through coupled quantum dots became a topic of interest once the basic phenomena in single dots were satisfactorily understood . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb oscillations at vanishing magnetic field were investigated and the role of the inter - dot coupling for the multiple peak structure of the conductance was shown @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next step was accomplished by livermore _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. @xcite who measured the conductance through coupled dots in the quantum hall regime . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the conductance peaks undergo shifts and also modulation as the magnetic field is varied continuously . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dot arrays are promising systems of investigation because of the analogy with `` artificial molecules '' and possibility of physical realizations of quantum bits ( qubits ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theoretical approach of the tunneling problem through arrays of quantum dots in strong magnetic field with the aim to elucidate several aspects : the mechanism of the multiplet formation , the effects of the intra- and inter - dot coulomb interaction and effects of the strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on a non - hermitian tight - binding hamiltonian used in the landauer - bttiker formalism with many terminals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - hermiticity of the hamiltonian arises by including the contribution of the terminals in the hamiltonian of the dot system in all powers of the perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that in our approach the dot array is considered as a quantum - mechanical coherent system . </S>",
    "<S> each quantum dot is modelled as a 2d rectangular plaquette and the coupling between them is ensured by tunneling terms ( see fig.1 ) . in what concerns the electron - electron interaction we go beyond the usual _ constant capacitance model _ and describe both the intra- and inter - dot electron - electron interaction by a coulomb - type term .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.4 cm 2 ) the formalism is presented shortly in what follows and represents the generalization of the method which was used in ref.4 for describing the transport properties of a single dot . for an array composed of @xmath0 dots , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian contains the following terms : @xmath1 the index @xmath2 counts the dots in the array , @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of an individual dot which includes the intra - dot electron - electron interaction , @xmath4 describes the tunnel - coupling of consecutive dots , while @xmath5 is the coulomb interaction between electrons located in different dots ( i.e. , the last term represents the so - called electrostatic inter - dot coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d spinless hamiltonian @xmath3 is considered in the hartree approximation , while the perpendicular magnetic field is taken in the peierls representation :    @xmath6    here @xmath7 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators in localized states indexed by @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the nearest - neighbour hopping integral in the dots . </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath10 comes from the peierls substitution and accounts for the magnetic flux through the unit cell of the lattice measured in quantum flux units @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> now we have to built up the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath12 which takes into account the coupling of the multiple dot system with the leads carrying the external current ; we note that @xmath12 depends on the energy @xmath13 of the incident electron : @xmath14 where the index @xmath15 denotes the sites where the leads are stuck to the dots .    finally , one has to calculate the retarded green function @xmath16 which is to be used in the landauer- bttiker formula in order to obtain the conductance @xmath17 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us enumerate the parameters of the problem : i ) the tunnel - coupling between the dot - system and the leads described by the parameter @xmath18 , ii ) the tunnel - coupling between dots in the array @xmath19 , iii ) the strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath20 and iv ) the gate voltage @xmath21 which can be applied on any dot @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the hopping integral in the dots is taken as @xmath22 , and with this choice all the other energies @xmath23 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are measured in units of @xmath24 .    for our two - dimensional problem </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath25 has to be done numerically , and the mean occupation number of each site @xmath26 in eq.(2 ) has to be calculated self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical effort depends on the number of dots in the array and on the dimension of each dot . </S>",
    "<S> when the electrostatic inter - dot coupling is neglected , this effort can be much reduced by using an iterative procedure , which allows the calculation of transmittance through any number of dots in the array , if the one - dot problem is solved .    </S>",
    "<S> we mention that the tight - binding model has already been used for the study of transmittance of quantum dot arrays in the work of kirczenow @xcite where each dot is associated with a single atom in the lattice , omitting thus the internal structure of the dots . </S>",
    "<S> we perform here an important step forward by describing each dot as a finite two - dimensional plaquette .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ox_spec ]    0.4 cm 3 ) in small quantum dots , which is the topic of our interest , the size quantization compete with the charging effects produced by the electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> so , we discuss first the case of non - interacting electrons in order to distinguish afterwards the effects due to the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum system has a specific energy spectrum depending on the number of dots in the array and on the coupling constant between them which shows similarities to the hofstadter spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however two main differences appear : the spectrum of the array exhibits a multiplet structure due to the tunnel - coupling between dots which lifts the degeneracy of the energy levels and , on the other hand , the spectrum contains edge states which are induced by the vanishing boundary conditions imposed to the wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the case of many coupled dots the difference between edge and bulk states is difficult to be realized in geometrical terms so that , essentially , they differ by their chirality . </S>",
    "<S> this is even more stringent in the presence of the electron - electron interaction , when geometrical deformations of the eigenstates occur . </S>",
    "<S> since the array is a coherent quantum system the eigenfunctions have the character of molecular states . </S>",
    "<S> when one of the dots in the array is detuned ( by applying a gate potential on it ) the molecular states are scrambled with important effects on the longitudinal and transverse ( hall ) conductances .    evidently , the transmittance spectrum as a function of fermi energy ( @xmath27 ) has to correspond to the structure of the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , this depends on the strength of the coupling between the system of dots and the external leads , expressed by the parameter @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , a multiplet can be put into evidence only if the imaginary part of @xmath28 is less than the interlevel distance and such a situation occurs only for small @xmath18 . for a double dot this </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig.2a and b where the correspondence between the energy levels and the peaks of the transmittance is evident indicating the resonance tunneling process of the electron through the coherent double dot structure . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , a large value of this parameter , as it is considered in fig.2c , spoils the resonant aspect and the one - to - one correspondence between the energy levels of the isolated quantum system and the transmittance peaks . in this case , other aspects like the fano profile of the transmittance peaks or the fano zeros are the topics of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.4 cm 4 ) we now look for the effects of the interaction on the transmittance spectrum of multiple dots . from the single dot problem we have learned that , at least in the self - consistent hartree approximation , the electron - electron interaction gives rise to an increase in the level spacing and of the width of transmission peaks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the same thing occurs also for coherent multiple dots and fig.3 confirms these expectations when compared with fig.2b . </S>",
    "<S> the same fig.3 also shows the increase of the splitting with increasing tunneling between dots and in fact fig.3b indicates already the saturation of the splitting effect . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation is non - linear in the coupling parameter @xmath19 and can be put into evidence in a theoretical calculation only by taking into account all order of the perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the sake of clarity of the drawings we show the results for @xmath29 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in fig.3 are obtained by taking into account the total coulomb interaction . however </S>",
    "<S> , one asks usually how important the inter - dot interaction is . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution represents an additional term compared to the intra - dot electron - electron interaction , and it is generally accepted that the strength @xmath20 of the inter - dot interaction is smaller than in the intra - dot case because of the screening produced by the metallic gates which exist between neighbouring dots @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the inter - dot term should accentuate the interaction effects known for the transmission through a single dot . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the interaction energy is positive , in the presence of the additional inter - dot coupling the whole transmittance spectrum should be pushed upwards on the energy scale , as it can be noticed by comparing fig.4a and b. however , the comparison indicates a rather messy behaviour in the domain @xmath30 ; this is because here the spectrum is occupied mainly by bulk states which are more sensitive to the interaction , meaning that they undergo easily geometrical deformations and , in addition , edge states are intercalated among them @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ox_trans ]    0.4 cm 5 ) our approach helps in understanding the recent experiments by livermore et al @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fig.3a - c in ref.3 reveal that , in strong magnetic field , the transmittance of a double dot behaves as follows : i ) at a given magnetic field but increasing inter - dot coupling , one starts with single peaks ( figure a ) , then twin peaks appear ( figure b ) and finally , at large inter - dot coupling , the saturation consisting again in individual peaks occurs ( figure c ) . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) with increasing magnetic field the position of each peak shifts linearly ( in spite of a zig - zag appearance ) versus larger gate voltages . both these features can be described by our model even without considering the interaction . our results shown in fig.5 indicate a striking similarity to the experimental situation . </S>",
    "<S> they indicate both the increase of the distance between the twin peaks with the increasing inter - dot tunneling @xmath19 and the drift of the peaks at the variation of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the blurred , quasi - zig - zag behaviour of this drift is not however much evident in our calculations which are performed for non - interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> so , the idea expressed in ref.3 that this behaviour is due to interaction effects turns out to be correct ; our calculations for the interacting case are in progress . </S>",
    "<S> our approach puts however into evidence that such a regular behaviour , as observed in the experiment , can not occur in any range of the energy spectrum , but only if the fermi level lies in a region covered by edge states . </S>",
    "<S> fig.2a shows also that only the edge states are regularly distributed and well separated on the energy scale .    ,  b ) @xmath31.,width=604 ]    -14 cm    0.4 cm 6 ) the properties of the transmittance matrix impose specific behaviour to the hall resistance . in the presence of a constriction between the mesoscopic system and the external leads , even in strong magnetic field , the hall resistance @xmath32 exhibits oscillations instead of the usual quantum hall plateaus . since any minimum in transmittance give rise to a maximum in @xmath32 , the minima of the multiple dot transmittance produced by splitting result in small maxima of the hall resistance located in - between two large maxima . for a double dot with the configuration of leads shown in the sketch below ( fig.6 ) </S>",
    "<S> the hall resistance @xmath32 is given in terms of the conductance matrix elements by the following expression : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a positive @xmath35 subdeterminant of the @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 and the result is shown in fig.6 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that as the saturation is installed all maxima of @xmath32 become equivalent . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> such a property was not yet observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> -3 cm    -4.5 cm    in conclusion , an appropriate form of the landauer - bttiker approach has been used to describe the electronic transport through an array of coupled quantum dots placed in a strong perpendicular magnetic field . within the tight - binding model and the self - consistent hartree approximation for both intra- and inter - dot coulomb interaction , we have shown that the multiplet structure is determined by the tunnel - coupling between dots , while the coulomb interaction gives rise to a significant width of the peaks and increase of the splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the peak splitting shows saturation at the perfect tunnel - coupling of the dots . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum states of the edge - type are much more robust to the electron - electron interaction then the bulk - type states which undergo strong deformations with consequences for the transmittance spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the regular drift of the sub - peaks with the variation of the magnetic field , which has been observed experimentally @xcite , occurs only if the fermi level lies in a domain of the energy spectrum filled with edge - states . </S>",
    "<S> the multiplet structure of the transmittance yields small oscillations of the hall resistance in the quantum regime .    </S>",
    "<S> further interesting problems such as the magnetic drift in the presence of the electron - electron interaction , the detuning effects on the hall resistance , and the coherence properties of the array ( as given by the phase of the transmittance ) will be the subjects of future work which is under way </S>",
