    "labeled transition systems constitute a widely used model of concurrent computation .",

    "semantics @xcite .",
    "the reason for this lack of results on finite bases , apart from the inherent difficulties arising with weak semantics , may be that it is usually not so straightforward to define a notion of unique normal form for _ open _ terms in a _",
    "weak _ semantics . here",
    "we will employ a saturation technique , in which normal forms are saturated with subterms .    in this paper , we focus on two closely related weak semantics , based on failures and impossible futures . a _ weak failure _ consists of a trace @xmath3 and a set @xmath4 , both of concrete actions .",
    "a state exhibits this weak failure pair if it can perform the trace @xmath3 ( possibly intertwined with @xmath1 s ) to a state that can not perform any action in @xmath4 ( even after performing @xmath1 s ) . in a _ weak impossible future _ , @xmath4 can be a set of traces .",
    "weak failures semantics plays an essential role for the process algebra csp @xcite . for convergent processes",

    "weak impossible futures semantics @xcite is a natural variant of possible futures semantics @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that weak impossible futures semantics , with an additional root condition , is the coarsest congruence containing weak bisimilarity with explicit divergence that respects deadlock / livelock traces ( or fair testing , or any liveness property under a global fairness assumption ) and assigns unique solutions to recursive equations .",
    "the heart of our paper is a finite basis for the inequational theory of bccs modulo the weak failures _ preorder_.",
    "the axiomatization consists of the standard axioms a1 - 4 for bisimulation , three extra axioms wf1 - 3 for failures semantics , and in case of a finite alphabet @xmath4 , an extra axiom wf@xmath5 .",

    "our proof has the same general structure as the beautiful proof for testing equivalences given in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "pivotal to this is the construction of `` saturated '' sets of actions within a term @xcite .",
    "since here we want to obtain an @xmath0-completeness result , we extend this notion to variables .",

    "furthermore , we apply an algorithm from @xcite to obtain a finite basis for bccs modulo weak failures _",

    "this shows a remarkable difference with weak failures semantics , in spite of the strong similarity between the definitions of these semantics ( and between their ground - complete axiomatizations ) . as said , in case of an infinite alphabet , bccs modulo the weak impossible futures preorder has a finite basis @xcite .",
    "however , we show that in case of a finite alphabet , such a finite basis does not exist",
    ". moreover , in case of weak impossible futures _ equivalence _ , there is no finite ground - complete axiomatization , regardless of the cardinality of the alphabet .    a finite basis for the equational theory of bccsp modulo ( concrete ) failures semantics was given in @xcite .",
    "the equational theory of bccsp modulo ( concrete ) impossible futures semantics is studied in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that our results for weak semantics agree with their concrete counterparts , with very similar proofs .",
