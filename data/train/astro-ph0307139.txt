    "supernovae ( sne ) come in two main varieties ( see filippenko 1997b for a review ) .",
    "those whose optical spectra exhibit hydrogen are classified as type ii , while hydrogen - deficient sne are designated type i. sne  i are further subdivided according to the appearance of the early - time spectrum : sne  ia are characterized by strong absorption near 6150    ( now attributed to si  ii ) , sne  ib lack this feature but instead show prominent he  i lines , and sne  ic have neither the si  ii nor the he  i lines .",
    "sne  ia are believed to result from the thermonuclear disruption of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs , while sne  ii come from core collapse in massive supergiant stars .",
    "the latter mechanism probably produces most sne  ib / ic as well , but the progenitor stars previously lost their outer layers of hydrogen or even helium .    it has long been recognized that sne  ia may be very useful distance indicators for a number of reasons ; see branch & tammann ( 1992 ) , branch ( 1998 ) , and references therein .",
    "( 1 ) they are exceedingly luminous , with peak @xmath15 averaging @xmath16 mag if @xmath17 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 . ( 2 ) `` normal '' sne  ia have small dispersion among their peak absolute magnitudes ( @xmath18 mag ) .",
    "( 3 ) our understanding of the progenitors and explosion mechanism of sne  ia is on a reasonably firm physical basis . ( 4 ) little cosmic evolution is expected in the peak luminosities of sne  ia , and it can be modeled .",
    "this makes sne  ia superior to galaxies as distance indicators .",
    "( 5 ) one can perform _ local _ tests of various possible complications and evolutionary effects by comparing nearby sne  ia in different environments .",
    "research on sne  ia in the 1990s has demonstrated their enormous potential as cosmological distance indicators .",
    "although there are subtle effects that must indeed be taken into account , it appears that sne  ia provide among the most accurate values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( the deceleration parameter ) , @xmath6 ( the matter density ) , and @xmath7 [ the cosmological constant , @xmath21 .",
    "there have been two major teams involved in the systematic investigation of high - redshift sne  ia for cosmological purposes .",
    "the `` supernova cosmology project '' ( scp ) is led by saul perlmutter of the lawrence berkeley laboratory , while the `` high - z supernova search team '' ( hzt ) is led by brian schmidt of the mt .",
    "stromlo and siding springs observatories .",
    "i have been privileged to work with both teams ( see filippenko 2001 for a personal account ) , but my primary allegiance is now with the hzt .      until the mid-1990s , the traditional way in which sne  ia were used for cosmological distance determinations was to assume that they are perfect `` standard candles '' and to compare their observed peak brightness with those of sne  ia in galaxies whose distances had been independently determined ( e.g. , with cepheid variables ) .",
    "the rationale was that sne  ia exhibit relatively little scatter in their peak blue luminosity ( @xmath220.5 mag ; branch & miller 1993 ) , and even less if `` peculiar '' or highly reddened objects were eliminated from consideration by using a color cut .",
    "moreover , the optical spectra of sne  ia are usually rather homogeneous , if care is taken to compare objects at similar times relative to maximum brightness ( riess et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "over 80% of all sne  ia discovered through the early 1990s were `` normal '' ( branch , fisher , & nugent 1993 ) .    from a hubble diagram constructed with unreddened , moderately distant sne  ia ( @xmath0 ) for which peculiar motions should be small and relative distances ( as given by ratios of redshifts )",
    "are accurate , vaughan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that @xmath23 in a series of papers , sandage et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and saha et al .",
    "( 1997 ) combine similar relations with _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ cepheid distances to the host galaxies of seven sne  ia to derive @xmath24 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .    over the past two decades",
    "it has become clear , however , that sne  ia do _ not _ constitute a perfectly homogeneous subclass ( e.g. , filippenko 1997a , b ) .",
    "in retrospect this should have been obvious : the hubble diagram for sne  ia exhibits scatter larger than the photometric errors , the dispersion actually _ rises _ when reddening corrections are applied ( under the assumption that all sne  ia have uniform , very blue intrinsic colors at maximum ; van den bergh & pazder 1992 ; sandage & tammann 1993 ) , and there are some significant outliers whose anomalous magnitudes can not possibly be explained by extinction alone .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric peculiarities have been noted with increasing frequency in well - observed sne  ia .",
    "a striking case is sn 1991 t ; its pre - maximum spectrum did not exhibit si  ii or ca  ii absorption lines , yet two months past maximum brightness the spectrum was nearly indistinguishable from that of a classical sn  ia ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992b ; phillips et al .",
    "the light curves of sn 1991 t were slightly broader than the sn  ia template curves , and the object was probably somewhat more luminous than average at maximum .",
    "another well - observed , peculiar sne  ia is sn 1991bg ( filippenko et al . 1992a",
    "; leibundgut et al . 1993 ; turatto et al . 1996 ) . at maximum brightness",
    "it was subluminous by 1.6 mag in @xmath25 and 2.5 mag in @xmath26 , its colors were intrinsically red , and its spectrum was peculiar ( with a deep absorption trough due to ti  ii ) .",
    "moreover , the decline from maximum was very steep , the @xmath27-band light curve did not exhibit a secondary maximum like normal sne  ia , and the velocity of the ejecta was unusually low .",
    "the photometric heterogeneity among sne  ia is well demonstrated by suntzeff ( 1996 ) with objects having excellent @xmath28 light curves .",
    "although sne  ia can no longer be considered perfect `` standard candles , '' they are still exceptionally useful for cosmological distance determinations . excluding those of low luminosity ( which are hard to find , especially at large distances ) ,",
    "most of the nearby sne  ia that had been discovered through the early 1990s were _ nearly _ standard ( branch et al .",
    "1993 ; but see li et al .",
    "2001b for more recent evidence of a higher intrinsic peculiarity rate ) . also , after many tenuous suggestions ( e.g. , pskovskii 1977 , 1984 ; branch 1981 ) , phillips ( 1993 ) found convincing evidence for a correlation between light curve shape and the luminosity at maximum brightness by quantifying the photometric differences among a set of nine well - observed sne  ia , using a parameter [ @xmath29 that measures the total drop ( in @xmath26 magnitudes ) from @xmath26-band maximum to @xmath30 days after @xmath26 maximum .",
    "in all cases the host galaxies of his sne  ia have accurate relative distances from surface brightness fluctuations or from the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the intrinsically bright sne  ia clearly decline more slowly than dim ones , but the correlation is stronger in @xmath26 than in @xmath25 or @xmath27 .    using sne",
    "ia discovered during the caln / tololo survey ( @xmath0 ) , hamuy et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996b ) confirm and refine the phillips ( 1993 ) correlation between peak luminosity and @xmath31 .",
    "apparently the slope is steep only at low luminosities ; thus , objects such as sn 1991bg skew the slope of the best - fitting single straight line .",
    "hamuy et al .",
    "reduce the scatter in the hubble diagram of normal , unreddened sne  ia to only 0.17 mag in @xmath26 and 0.14 mag in @xmath25 ; see also tripp ( 1997 ) .",
    "yet another parameterization is the `` stretch '' method of perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and goldhaber et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : the @xmath26-band light curves of sne  ia appear nearly identical when expanded or contracted temporally by a factor @xmath32 , where the value of @xmath33 varies among objects . in a similar but distinct effort , riess , press , & kirshner ( 1995 ) show that the luminosity of sne  ia correlates with the detailed _ shape _ of the overall light curve .    by using light curve shapes measured through several different filters , riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996a )",
    "extend their analysis and objectively eliminate the effects of interstellar extinction : a sn  ia that has an unusually red @xmath34 color at maximum brightness is assumed to be _ intrinsically _ subluminous if its light curves rise and decline quickly , or of normal luminosity but significantly _ reddened _ if its light curves rise and decline more slowly . with a set of 20 sne  ia consisting of the caln / tololo sample and their own objects , they show that the dispersion decreases from 0.52 mag to 0.12 mag after application of this `` multi - color light curve shape '' ( mlcs ) method .",
    "the results from a recent , expanded set of nearly 50 sne  ia indicate that the dispersion decreases from 0.44 mag to 0.15 mag ( fig",
    "the resulting hubble constant is @xmath35 ( statistical ) km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , with an additional systematic and zeropoint uncertainty of @xmath36 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "riess et al . ( 1996a ) also show that the hubble flow is remarkably linear ; indeed , sne  ia now constitute the best evidence for linearity .",
    "finally , they argue that the dust affecting sne  ia is _ not _ of circumstellar origin , and show quantitatively that the extinction curve in external galaxies typically does not differ from that in the milky way ( cf . branch & tammann 1992 , but see tripp 1998 ) .",
    "the advantage of systematically correcting the luminosities of sne  ia at high redshifts rather than trying to isolate `` normal '' ones seems clear in view of evidence that the luminosity of sne  ia may be a function of stellar population . if the most luminous sne  ia occur in young stellar populations ( e.g. , hamuy et al .",
    "1996a , 2000 ; branch , baron , & romanishin 1996 ; ivanov , hamuy , & pinto 2000 ) , then we might expect the mean peak luminosity of high-@xmath37 sne  ia to differ from that of a local sample .",
    "alternatively , the use of cepheids ( population i objects ) to calibrate local sne  ia can lead to a zeropoint that is too luminous . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as the physics of sne  ia is essentially the same in young stellar populations locally and at high redshift , we should be able to adopt the luminosity correction methods ( photometric and spectroscopic ) found from detailed studies of low-@xmath37 sne  ia .",
    "large numbers of nearby sne  ia are now being found by my team s lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) conducted with the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; li et al .",
    "2000 ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ; see http://astro.berkeley.edu/@xmath38bait/kait.html ) .",
    "ccd images are taken of @xmath39 galaxies per night and compared with kait `` template images '' obtained earlier ; the templates are automatically subtracted from the new images and analyzed with computer software .",
    "the system reobserves the best candidates the same night , to eliminate star - like cosmic rays , asteroids , and other sources of false alarms .",
    "the next day , undergraduate students at uc berkeley examine all candidates , including weak ones , and they glance at all subtracted images to locate sne that might be near bright , poorly subtracted stars or galactic nuclei .",
    "loss discovered 20 sne ( of all types ) in 1998 , 40 in 1999 , 38 in 2000 , 69 in 2001 , and 82 in 2002 , making it by far the world s most successful search for nearby sne .",
    "the most important objects were photometrically monitored through @xmath28 ( and sometimes @xmath40 ) filters ( e.g. , li et al . 2001a , 2003 ; modjaz et al .",
    "2001 ; leonard et al . 2002a , b ) , and unfiltered follow - up observations ( e.g. , matheson et al .",
    "2001 ) were made of most of them during the course of the sn search .",
    "this growing sample of well - observed sne  ia should allow us to more precisely calibrate the mlcs method , as well as to look for correlations between the observed properties of the sne and their environment ( hubble type of host galaxy , metallicity , stellar population , etc . ) .",
    "these same techniques can be applied to construct a hubble diagram with high - redshift sne  ia , from which the value of @xmath41 can be determined . with enough objects spanning a range of redshifts",
    ", we can determine @xmath6 and @xmath7 independently ( e.g. , goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) .",
    "contours of peak apparent @xmath42-band magnitude for sne  ia at two redshifts have different slopes in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane , and the regions of intersection provide the answers we seek .",
    "based on the pioneering work of norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , whose goal was to find sne in moderate - redshift clusters of galaxies , the scp ( perlmutter et al . 1995a , 1997 ) and the hzt ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998 ) devised a strategy that almost guarantees the discovery of many faint , distant sne  ia `` on demand , '' during a predetermined set of nights .",
    "this `` batch '' approach to studying distant sne allows follow - up spectroscopy and photometry to be scheduled in advance , resulting in a systematic study not possible with random discoveries .",
    "most of the searched fields are equatorial , permitting follow - up from both hemispheres .",
    "the scp was the first group to convincingly demonstrate the ability to find sne in batches .",
    "our approach is simple in principle .",
    "pairs of first - epoch images are obtained with wide - field cameras on large telescopes ( e.g. , the big throughput camera on the ctio 4-m blanco telescope ) during the nights around new moon , followed by second - epoch images 34 weeks later .",
    "( pairs of images permit removal of cosmic rays , asteroids , and distant kuiper - belt objects . )",
    "these are compared immediately using well - tested software , and new sn candidates are identified in the second - epoch images ( fig .",
    "spectra are obtained as soon as possible after discovery to verify that the objects are sne  ia and determine their redshifts .",
    "each team has already found over 150 sne in concentrated batches , as reported in numerous _ iau circulars _",
    "( e.g. , perlmutter et al . 1995b ,",
    "11 sne with @xmath43 ; suntzeff et al .",
    "1996 , 17 sne with @xmath44 ) .",
    "the observed sn  ia rate at @xmath45 is consistent with the low-@xmath37 sn  ia rate together with plausible star - formation histories ( pain et al .",
    "2002 ; tonry et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the error bars on the high-@xmath37 rate are still quite large .",
    "intensive photometry of the sne  ia commences within a few days after procurement of the second - epoch images ; it is continued throughout the ensuing and subsequent dark runs . in a few cases _ hst _ images are obtained .",
    "as expected , most of the discoveries are _ on the rise or near maximum brightness_. when possible , the sne are observed in filters that closely match the redshifted @xmath26 and @xmath25 bands ; this way , the k - corrections become only a second - order effect ( kim , goobar , & perlmutter 1996 ; nugent , kim , & perlmutter 2002 ) .",
    "we try to obtain excellent multi - color light curves , so that reddening and luminosity corrections can be applied ( riess et al .",
    "1996a ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996a , b ) .",
    "although sne in the magnitude range 2222.5 can sometimes be spectroscopically confirmed with 4-m class telescopes , the signal - to - noise ratios are low , even after several hours of integration .",
    "certainly keck or the vlt are required for the fainter objects ( 22.524.5 mag ) . with the largest telescopes , not only",
    "can we rapidly confirm a substantial number of candidate sne , but we can search for peculiarities in the spectra that might indicate evolution of sne  ia with redshift . moreover , high - quality spectra allow us to measure the age of a sn : we have developed a method for automatically comparing the spectrum of a sn  ia with a library of spectra corresponding to many different epochs in the development of sne  ia ( riess et al .",
    "our technique also has great practical utility at the telescope : we can determine the age of a sn `` on the fly , '' within half an hour after obtaining its spectrum .",
    "this allows us to decide rapidly which sne are best for subsequent photometric follow - up , and we immediately alert our collaborators on other telescopes .      first , we note that the light curves of high - redshift sne  ia are broader than those of nearby sne  ia ; the initial indications ( leibundgut et al . 1996 ;",
    "goldhaber et al .",
    "1997 ) , based on small numbers of sne  ia , are amply confirmed with the larger samples ( goldhaber et al .",
    "quantitatively , the amount by which the light curves are `` stretched '' is consistent with a factor of @xmath46 , as expected if redshifts are produced by the expansion of space rather than by `` tired light '' and other non - expansion hypotheses for the redshifts of objects at cosmological distances .",
    "[ for non - standard cosmological interpretations of the sn  ia data , see narlikar & arp ( 1997 ) and hoyle , burbidge , & narlikar ( 2000 ) .",
    "] we also demonstrate this _ spectroscopically _ at the @xmath47 confidence level for a single object : the spectrum of sn 1996bj ( @xmath48 ) evolved more slowly than those of nearby sne  ia , by a factor consistent with @xmath4 ( riess et al .",
    "although one might be able to argue that something other than universal expansion could be the cause of the apparent stretching of sn  ia light curves at high redshifts , it is much more difficult to attribute apparently slower evolution of spectral details to an unknown effect .    the formal value of @xmath6 derived from sne  ia has changed with time .",
    "the scp published the first result ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1995a ) , based on a single object , sn 1992bi at @xmath49 : @xmath50 ( assuming that @xmath51 ) . the scp s analysis of their first seven objects ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ) suggested a much larger value of @xmath52 ( if @xmath51 ) or @xmath53 ( if @xmath54 ) .",
    "such a high - density universe seemed at odds with other , independent measurements of @xmath6 .",
    "however , with the subsequent inclusion of just one more object , sn 1997ap at @xmath55 ( the highest known for a sn  ia at the time ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ) , their estimates were revised back down to @xmath56 if @xmath51 , and @xmath57 if @xmath58 ; the apparent brightness of sn 1997ap had been precisely measured with _",
    "hst _ , so it substantially affected the best fits .",
    "meanwhile , the hzt published ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998a ) an analysis of four objects ( three of them observed with _",
    "hst _ ) , including sn 1997ck at @xmath59 , at that time a redshift record , although they can not be absolutely certain that the object was a sn  ia because the spectrum is too poor .",
    "from these data , the hzt derived that @xmath60 ( assuming @xmath51 ) and @xmath61 ( assuming @xmath58 ) , inconsistent with the high @xmath6 initially found by perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) but consistent with the revised estimate in perlmutter et al .",
    "an independent analysis of 10 sne  ia using the `` snapshot '' distance method ( with which conclusions are drawn from sparsely observed sne  ia ) gave quantitatively similar conclusions ( riess et al .",
    "however , none of these early data sets carried the statistical discriminating power to detect cosmic acceleration .",
    "the scp s next results were announced at the 1998 january aas meeting in washington , dc . a press conference was scheduled , with the stated purpose of presenting and discussing the then - current evidence for a low-@xmath6 universe as published by perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1998 ; scp ) and garnavich et al .",
    "( 1998a ; hzt ) .",
    "when showing the scp s hubble diagram for sne  ia , however , perlmutter also pointed out tentative evidence for _ acceleration _ !",
    "he stated that the conclusion was uncertain , and that the data were equally consistent with no acceleration ; the systematic errors had not yet been adequately assessed .",
    "essentially the same conclusion was given by the scp in their talks at a conference on dark matter , near los angeles , in february 1998 ( goldhaber & perlmutter 1998 ) .",
    "although it chose not to reveal them at the same 1998 january aas meeting , the hzt already had similar , tentative evidence for acceleration in their own sn  ia data set .",
    "the hzt continued to perform numerous checks of their data analysis and interpretation , including fairly thorough consideration of various possible systematic effects .",
    "unable to find any significant problems , even with the possible systematic effects , the hzt reported detection of a _ nonzero _ value for @xmath7 ( based on 16 high-@xmath37 sne  ia ) at the los angeles dark matter conference in february 1998 ( filippenko & riess 1998 ) , and soon thereafter submitted a formal paper that was published in september 1998 ( riess et al .",
    "their original hubble diagram for the 10 best - observed high-@xmath37 sne  ia is given in figure 1.3 ( _ left _ ) . with the mlcs method applied to the full set of 16 sne  ia , the hzt s formal results were @xmath62 if @xmath58 , or @xmath63 ( unphysical ) if @xmath51 . if one demanded that @xmath64 , then the best value for @xmath7 was @xmath65 .",
    "these conclusions did not change significantly when only the 10 best - observed sne  ia were used ( fig .",
    "1.3 , _ left _ ; @xmath66 if @xmath58 ) .",
    "another important constraint on the cosmological parameters could be obtained from measurements of the angular scale of the first acoustic peak of the cmb ( e.g. , zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ; eisenstein , hu , & tegmark 1998 ) ; the sn  ia and cmb techniques provide nearly complementary information .",
    "a stunning result was already available by mid-1998 from existing measurements ( e.g. , hancock et al .",
    "1998 ; lineweaver & barbosa 1998 ) : the hzt s analysis of the sn  ia data in riess et al .",
    "( 1998b ) demonstrated that @xmath67 ( fig .",

    "1999 , and others ) .    somewhat later",
    "( june 1999 ) , the scp published almost identical results , implying an accelerating expansion of the universe , based on an essentially independent set of 42 high-@xmath37 sne  ia ( perlmutter et al .",
    "their data , together with those of the hzt , are shown in figure 1.4 ( _ left _ ) , and the corresponding confidence contours in the @xmath7 vs. @xmath6 plane are given in figure 1.4 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "this incredible agreement suggested that neither group had made a large , simple blunder ; if the result was wrong , the reason must be subtle .",
    "had there been only one team working in this area , it is likely that far fewer astronomers and physicists throughout the world would have taken the result seriously .",
    "moreover , already in 19981999 there was tentative evidence that the `` dark energy '' driving the accelerated expansion was indeed consistent with the cosmological constant , @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 dominates , then the equation of state of the dark energy should have an index @xmath68 , where the pressure ( @xmath69 ) and density ( @xmath70 ) are related according to @xmath14 .",
    "garnavich et al .",
    "( 1998b ) and perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) already set an interesting limit , @xmath71 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "however , more high - quality data at @xmath72 are needed to narrow the allowed range , in order to test other proposed candidates for dark energy such as various forms of `` quintessence '' ( e.g. , caldwell , dav , & steinhardt 1998 ) .    although the cmb results appeared reasonably persuasive in 19981999",
    ", one could argue that fluctuations on different scales had been measured with different instruments , and that suble systematic effects might lead to erroneous conclusions .",
    "these fears were dispelled only 12 years later , when the more accurate and precise results of the boomerang collaboration were announced ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "shortly thereafter the maxima collaboration distributed their very similar findings ( hanany et al .",
    "2000 ; balbi et al .",
    "2000 ; netterfield et al .",
    "2002 ; see also the toco , dasi , and many other measurements ) .",
    "figure 1.4 ( _ right _ ) illustrates that the cmb measurements tightly constrain @xmath73 to be close to unity ; we appear to live in a flat universe , in agreement with most inflationary models for the early universe ! combined with the sn  ia results , the evidence for nonzero @xmath7 was fairly strong . making the argument even more compelling was the fact that various studies of clusters of galaxies ( see summary by bahcall et al . 1999 ) showed that @xmath74 , consistent with the results in figures 1.3 and 1.4 .",
    "thus , a `` concordance cosmology '' had emerged : @xmath74 , @xmath75  consistent with what had been suspected some years earlier by ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ; see also carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) .",
    "yet another piece of evidence for a nonzero value of @xmath5 was provided by the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; peacock et al .",
    "2001 ; percival et al . 2001 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "combined with the cmb maps , their results are inconsistent with a universe dominated by gravitating dark matter .",
    "again , the implication is that about 70% of the mass - energy density of the universe consists of some sort of dark energy whose gravitational effect is repulsive .",
    "just as this review was going to press , results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy prove ( wmap ) _  appeared ; together with the 2dfgrs constraints , they confirm and refine the concordance cosmology ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the dynamical age of the universe can be calculated from the cosmological parameters . in an empty universe with no cosmological constant ,",

    "again , the scp s result was very similar ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) , since it was based on nearly the same derived values for the cosmological parameters .",

    ", the ages of the oldest stars no longer seemed to exceed the expansion age of the universe ; the long - standing `` age crisis '' had evidently been resolved .",
    "although the convergence of different methods on the same answer is reassuring , and suggests that the concordance cosmology is correct , it is important to vigorously test each method to make sure it is not leading us astray .",
    "moreover , only through such detailed studies will the accuracy and precision of the methods improve , allowing us to eventually set better constraints on the equation of state parameter , @xmath88 . here",
    "i discuss the systematic effects that could adversely affect the sn  ia results .",
    "high - redshift sne  ia are observed to be dimmer than expected in an empty universe ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) with no cosmological constant . at @xmath90 , where the sn  ia observations have their greatest leverage on @xmath5 , the difference in apparent magnitude between an @xmath91 ( @xmath51 ) universe and a flat universe with @xmath92 is only about 0.25 mag .",
    "thus , we need to find out if chemical abundances , stellar populations , selection bias , gravitational lensing , or grey dust can have an effect this large .",
    "although both the hzt and scp had considered many of these potential systematic effects in their original discovery papers ( riess et al .",
    "1998b ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) , and had shown with reasonable confidence that obvious ones were not greatly affecting their conclusions , if was of course possible that they were wrong , and that the data were being misinterpreted .      perhaps the most obvious possible culprit is _ evolution _ of sne  ia over cosmic time , due to changes in metallicity , progenitor mass , or some other factor . if the peak luminosity of sne  ia were lower at high redshift , then the case for @xmath93 would weaken .",
    "conversely , if the distant explosions are more powerful , then the case for acceleration strengthens .",
    "theorists are not yet sure what the sign of the effect will be , if it is present at all ; different assumptions lead to different conclusions ( hflich et al .",
    "1998 ; umeda et al . 1999 ; nomoto et al .",
    "2000 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ) .    of course",
    ", it is extremely difficult , if not effectively impossible , to obtain an accurate , independent measure of the peak luminosity of high-@xmath37 sne  ia , and hence to directly test for luminosity evolution .",
    "however , we can more easily determine whether _ other _ observable properties of low-@xmath37 and high-@xmath37 sne  ia differ . if they are all the same , it is more probable that the peak luminosity is constant as well  but if they differ , then the peak luminosity might also be affected ( e.g. , hflich et al .",
    "drell , loredo , & wasserman ( 2000 ) , for example , argue that there are reasons to suspect evolution , because the average properties of existing samples of high-@xmath37 and low-@xmath37 sne  ia seem to differ ( e.g. , the high-@xmath37 sne  ia are more uniform ) .    the local sample of sne  ia displays a weak correlation between light curve shape ( or peak luminosity ) and host galaxy type , in the sense that the most luminous sne  ia with the broadest light curves only occur in late - type galaxies . both early - type and late - type galaxies provide hosts for dimmer sne  ia with narrower light curves ( hamuy et al .",
    "the mean luminosity difference for sne  ia in late - type and early - type galaxies is @xmath94 mag .",
    "in addition , the sn  ia rate per unit luminosity is almost twice as high in late - type galaxies as in early - type galaxies at the present epoch ( cappellaro et al .",
    "these results may indicate an evolution of sne  ia with progenitor age .",
    "possibly relevant physical parameters are the mass , metallicity , and c / o ratio of the progenitor ( hflich et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we expect that the relation between light curve shape and peak luminosity that applies to the range of stellar populations and progenitor ages encountered in the late - type and early - type hosts in our nearby sample should also be applicable to the range we encounter in our distant sample .",
    "in fact , the range of age for sn  ia progenitors in the nearby sample is likely to be _ larger _ than the change in mean progenitor age over the 46 gyr lookback time to the high-@xmath37 sample .",
    "thus , to first order at least , our local sample should correct the distances for progenitor or age effects .",
    "we can place empirical constraints on the effect that a change in the progenitor age would have on our sn  ia distances by comparing subsamples of low - redshift sne  ia believed to arise from old and young progenitors . in the nearby sample ,",
    "the mean difference between the distances for the early - type hosts ( 8 sne  ia ) and late - type hosts ( 19 sne  ia ) , at a given redshift , is 0.04 @xmath95 0.07 mag from the mlcs method .",
    "this difference is consistent with zero .",
    "even if the sn  ia progenitors evolved from one population at low redshift to the other at high redshift , we still would not explain the surplus in mean distance of 0.25 mag over the @xmath96 prediction .",
    "moreover , in a major study of high - redshift sne  ia as a function of galaxy morphology , the scp found no clear differences ( except for the amount of scatter ; see  1.5.2 ) between the cosmological results obtained with sne  ia in late - type and early - type galaxies ( sullivan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it is also reassuring that initial comparisons of high-@xmath37 sn  ia spectra appear remarkably similar to those observed at low redshift .",
    "for example , the spectral characteristics of sn 1998ai ( @xmath97 ) appear to be essentially indistinguishable from those of normal low-@xmath37 sne  ia ; see figure 1.5 ( _ left _ ) .",
    "in fact , the most obviously discrepant spectrum in this figure is the second one from the top , that of sn 1994b ( @xmath98 ) ; it is intentionally included as a `` decoy '' that illustrates the degree to which even the spectra of nearby , relatively normal sne  ia can vary .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that a dispersion in luminosity ( perhaps 0.2 mag ) exists even among the other , more normal sne  ia shown in figure 1.5 ( _ left _ ) ; thus , our spectra of sn 1998ai and other high-@xmath37 sne  ia are not yet sufficiently good for independent , _ precise _ determinations of peak luminosity from spectral features ( nugent et al .",
    "many of them , however , are sufficient for ruling out other sn types ( fig . 1.5 , _ right _ ) , or for identifying gross peculiarities such as those shown by sne 1991 t and 1991bg ; see coil et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we can help verify that the sne at @xmath72 being used for cosmology do not belong to a subluminous population of sne  ia by examining restframe @xmath27-band light curves .",
    "normal , nearby sne  ia show a pronounced second maximum in the @xmath27 band about a month after the first maximum and typically about 0.5 mag fainter ( e.g. , ford et al .",
    "1993 ; suntzeff 1996 ) .",
    "subluminous sne  ia , in contrast , do not show this second maximum , but rather follow a linear decline or show a muted second maximum ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992a ) . as discussed by riess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , tentative evidence for the second maximum is seen from the hzt s existing @xmath99-band ( restframe @xmath27-band ) data on sn 1999q ( @xmath100 ) ; see figure 1.6 ( _ left _ ) .",
    "additional tests with spectra and near - infrared light curves are currently being conducted .",
    "another way of using light curves to test for possible evolution of sne  ia is to see whether the rise time ( from explosion to maximum brightness ) is the same for high - redshift and low - redshift sne  ia ; a difference might indicate that the peak luminosities are also different ( hflich et al .",
    "riess et al . ( 1999c ) measured the risetime of nearby sne  ia , using data from kait , the beijing astronomical observatory ( bao ) sn search , and a few amateur astronomers .",
    "though the exact value of the risetime is a function of peak luminosity , for typical low - redshift sne  ia it is @xmath101 days .",
    "riess et al . ( 1999b ) pointed out that this differs by @xmath102 from the _ preliminary _ risetime of @xmath103 days reported in conferences by the scp ( goldhaber et al .",
    "1998a , b ; groom 1998 ) .",
    "however , more thorough analyses of the scp data ( aldering , knop , & nugent 2000 ; goldhaber et al . 2001 ) show that the high - redshift uncertainty of @xmath104 days that the scp originally reported was much too small because it did not account for systematic effects .",
    "the revised discrepancy with the low - redshift risetime is about @xmath47 or less .",
    "thus , the apparent difference in risetimes might be insignificant .",
    "even if the difference is real , however , its relevance to the peak luminosity is unclear ; the light curves may differ only in the first few days after the explosion , and this could be caused by small variations in conditions near the outer part of the exploding white dwarf that are inconsequential at the peak .",
    "our sn  ia distances have the important advantage of including corrections for interstellar extinction occurring in the host galaxy and the milky way .",
    "extinction corrections based on the relation between sn  ia colors and luminosity improve distance precision for a sample of nearby sne  ia that includes objects with substantial extinction ( riess et al .",
    "1996a ) ; the scatter in the hubble diagram is much reduced . moreover",
    ", the consistency of the measured hubble flow from sne  ia with late - type and early - type hosts ( see  1.5.1 ) shows that the extinction corrections applied to dusty sne  ia at low redshift do not alter the expansion rate from its value measured from sne  ia in low - dust environments .    in practice ,",
    "the high - redshift sne  ia generally appear to suffer very little extinction ; their @xmath34 colors at maximum brightness are normal , suggesting little color excess due to reddening .",
    "the most detailed available study is that of the scp ( sullivan et al .",
    "2003 ) : they found that the scatter in the hubble diagram is minimal for sne  ia in early - type host galaxies , but increases for sne  ia in late - type galaxies .",
    "moreover , on average the sne in late - type galaxies are slightly fainter ( by @xmath105 mag ) than those in early - type galaxies .",
    "finally , at peak brightness the colors of sne  ia in late - type galaxies are marginally redder than those in early - type galaxies .",
    "sullivan et al . ( 2003 ) conclude that extinction by dust in the host galaxies of sne  ia is one of the major sources of scatter in the high - redshift hubble diagram . by restricting their sample to sne  ia in early - type host galaxies ( presumably with minimal extinction )",
    ", they obtain a very tight hubble diagram that suggests a nonzero value for @xmath7 at the @xmath106 confidence level , under the assumption that @xmath58 . in the absence of this assumption , sne  ia in early - type hosts",
    "still imply that @xmath93 at nearly the 98% confidence level .",
    "the results for @xmath7 with sne  ia in late - type galaxies are quantitatively similar , but statistically less secure because of the larger scatter .",
    "riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996b ) found indications that the galactic ratios between selective absorption and color excess are similar for host galaxies in the nearby ( @xmath107 ) hubble flow . yet , what if these ratios changed with lookback time ( e.g. , aguirre 1999a ) ?",
    "could an evolution in dust - grain size descending from ancestral interstellar `` pebbles '' at higher redshifts cause us to underestimate the extinction ?",
    "large dust grains would not imprint the reddening signature of typical interstellar extinction upon which our corrections rely .",
    "however , viewing our sne through such gray interstellar grains would also induce a _",
    "dispersion _ in the derived distances . using the results of hatano , branch , & deaton ( 1998 ) , riess et al .",
    "( 1998b ) estimate that the expected dispersion would be 0.40 mag if the mean gray extinction were 0.25 mag ( the value required to explain the measured mlcs distances without a cosmological constant ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than the 0.21 mag dispersion observed in the high - redshift mlcs distances .",
    "furthermore , most of the observed scatter is already consistent with the estimated _ statistical _ errors , leaving little to be caused by gray extinction .",
    "nevertheless , if we assumed that _ all _ of the observed scatter were due to gray extinction , the mean shift in the sn  ia distances would be only 0.05 mag . with the existing observations , it is difficult to rule out this modest amount of gray interstellar extinction .",
    "gray _ intergalactic _ extinction could dim the sne without either telltale reddening or dispersion , if all lines of sight to a given redshift had a similar column density of absorbing material .",
    "the component of the intergalactic medium with such uniform coverage corresponds to the gas clouds producing lyman-@xmath108 forest absorption at low redshifts .",
    "these clouds have individual h  i column densities less than about @xmath109 ( bahcall et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , they display low metallicities , typically less than 10% of solar .",
    "gray extinction would require larger dust grains which would need a larger mass in heavy elements than typical interstellar grain size distributions to achieve a given extinction .",
    "it is possible that large dust grains are blown out of galaxies by radiation pressure , and are therefore not associated with lyman-@xmath108 clouds ( aguirre 1999b ) .    but even the dust postulated by aguirre ( 1999a , b ) and aguirre & haiman ( 1999 ) is not _",
    "completely _ gray , having a size of about 0.1  @xmath110 m .",
    "we can test for such nearly gray dust by observing high - redshift sne  ia over a wide wavelength range to measure the color excess it would introduce . if @xmath111 mag , then @xmath112 and @xmath113 should be 0.120.16 mag ( aguirre 1999a , b ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the 0.25 mag faintness is due to @xmath5 , then no such reddening should be seen .",
    "this effect is measurable using proven techniques ; so far , with just one sn  ia ( sn 1999q ; fig .",
    "1.6 , _ right _ ) , our results favor the no - dust hypothesis to better than 2@xmath114 ( riess et al . 2000 ) .",
    "more work along these lines is in progress .",
    "suppose , however , that for some reason the dust is _ very _ gray , or our color measurements are not sufficiently precise to rule out aguirre s ( or other ) dust . or , perhaps some other astrophysical systematic effect is fooling us , such as possible evolution of the white dwarf progenitors ( e.g. , hflich et al . 1998 ; umeda et al . 1999 ) , or gravitational lensing ( wambsganss , cen , & ostriker 1998 ) .",
    "the most decisive test to distinguish between @xmath5 and cumulative systematic effects is to examine the _ deviation _ of the observed peak magnitude of sne  ia from the magnitude expected in the low-@xmath6 , zero-@xmath5 model .",
    "if @xmath5 is positive , the deviation should actually begin to _ decrease _ at @xmath115 ; we will be looking so far back in time that the @xmath5 effect becomes small compared with @xmath6 , and the universe is decelerating at that epoch . if , on the other hand , a systematic bias such as gray dust or evolution of the white dwarf progenitors is the culprit , we expect that the deviation of the apparent magnitude will continue growing , unless the systematic bias is set up in such an unlikely way as to mimic the effects of @xmath5 ( drell et al .",
    "a turnover , or decrease of the deviation of apparent magnitude at high redshift , can be considered the `` smoking gun '' of @xmath5 .    in a wonderful demonstration of good luck and",
    "hard work , riess et al .",
    "( 2001 ) report on _ hst _ observations of a probable sn  ia at @xmath116 ( sn 1997ff , the most distant sn ever observed ) that suggest the expected turnover is indeed present , providing a tantalizing glimpse of the epoch of deceleration .",
    "( see also bentez et al .",
    "2002 , which corrects the observed magnitude of sn 1997ff for gravitational lensing . )",
    "sn 1997ff was discovered by gilliland & phillips ( 1998 ) in a repeat _ hst _ observation of the hubble deep field  north , and serendipitously monitored in the infrared with _ hst_/nicmos .",
    "the peak apparent sn brightness is consistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the concordance cosmological model , @xmath8 , @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "it is inconsistent with gray dust or simple luminosity evolution , when combined with the data for sne  ia at @xmath72 . on the other hand , it is wise to remain cautious : the error bars are large , and it is always possible that we are being fooled by this one object .",
    "the hzt and scp currently have programs to find and measure more sne  ia at such high redshifts .",
    "for example , sn candidates at very high redshifts ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "2002 ) have been found by `` piggybacking '' on the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) being conducted with the advanced camera for surveys aboard _",

    "( 3 ) adopting a prior based on the 2dfgrs constraint on @xmath6 ( percival et al . 2001 ) and assuming a flat universe , they derive that @xmath121 at 95% confidence .",

    "complete details on the sn  ia results , as well as figures , can be found in tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "every energy component in the universe can be parameterized by the way its density varies as the universe expands ( scale factor @xmath122 ) , with @xmath123 , and @xmath88 reflects the component s equation of state , @xmath124 , where @xmath69 is the pressure exerted by the component .",
    "so for matter , @xmath125 , while an energy component that does not vary with scale factor has @xmath126 , as in the cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "some really strange energies may have @xmath127 : their density increases with time ( carroll , hoffman , & trodden 2003 ) ! clearly , a good estimate of @xmath88 becomes the key to differentiating between models .",
    "the cmb observations imply that the geometry of the universe is close to flat , so the energy density of the dark component is simply related to the matter density by @xmath128 .",
    "this allows the luminosity distance as a function of redshift to be written as @xmath129 ^{-{1/2}}\\over(1+{\\rm z})^{{3/2}}}\\ ;   { \\rm dz } \\ ; , \\ ] ] showing that the dark energy density and equation of state directly influence the apparent brightness of standard candles .",
    "as demonstrated graphically in figure 1.8 ( _ left _ ) , sne  ia observed over a wide range of redshifts can constrain the dark energy parameters to a cosmologically interesting accuracy .",
    "but there are two major problems with using sne  ia to measure @xmath88 .",
    "first , systematic uncertainties in sn  ia peak luminosity limit how well @xmath130 can be measured .",
    "while statistical uncertainty can be arbitrarily reduced by finding thousands of sne  ia , intrinsic sn properties such as evolution and progenitor metallicity , and observational limits like photometric calibrations and k - corrections , create a systematic floor that can not be decreased by sheer force of numbers .",
    "we expect that systematics can be controlled to at best 3% .",
    "second , sne at @xmath131 are very hard to discover and study from the ground . as discussed above , both the hzt and the scp",
    "have found a few sne  ia at @xmath131 , but the numbers and quality of these light curves are insufficient for a @xmath88 measurement .",

    "the current values of @xmath6 from many methods ( most recently _ wmap _ : 0.27 ; spergel et al . 2003 ) make an excellent substitute for those expensive sne at @xmath132 .",
    "figure 1.8 ( _ left _ ) shows that a sn  ia sample with a maximum redshift of @xmath133 , combined with the current 10%  error on @xmath6 , will do as well as a sn  ia sample at much higher redshifts . within a few years",
