    "the problem of time relaxation around a local minimum of a free - energy landscape is ubiquitous in chemical physics .",
    "in fact , the landscape picture @xcite assumes a natural separation of low - temperature molecular motion sampling distinct potential energy minima , and vibration within a minimum .",
    "the manner in which a disordered material samples its landscape as a function of temperature thus provides information on its long - time relaxation properties .",
    "the energy landscape paradigm has been successfully applied to protein folding @xcite , the mechanical properties of glasses @xcite , and the dynamics of supercooled liquids @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "adam - gibbs formula @xcite suggests a phenomenological connection between kinetics and thermodynamics in disordered systems , that is , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a relaxation time , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two phenomenological constants , and @xmath4 is a configurational entropy factor related to the number of minima of the system s multidimensional energy surface .",
    "for instance , at low enough temperatures the system becomes stuck in a single minimum , the depth of which increases as the cooling rate decreases : this describes a glass transition . in this context , of prominent interest",
    "is the case of relaxation between two degenerate free - energy minima separated by an ( almost ) symmetric activation barrier . in the current literature this is referred to as the kramers problem @xcite . in calculating the average transition time between two such states ,",
    "one typically ignores the presence of other possible less stable ( more energetic ) states in the free - energy landscape @xcite .",
    "we show that statistically rare trajectories that connect two such degenerate states only after entering another neighboring state , are responsible for an increase of the relevant mean transition time , sometimes by orders of magnitude .",
    "the consequence is that in order to ignore the contribution of slowly meandering trajectories and keep using the results of standard kramers theory , one has to restrict the system s phase - space volume defining the free - energy stable states .",
    "our conclusion has an immediate counterpart and , hopefully , application in the strategies of path sampling for the numerical investigation of complex systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , an unfolded protein can explore thousands of intermediate structures ( conformations ) before reaching a long - lived ( stable ) folded conformation . the most numerically efficient approach to investigate",
    "this process involves simulating protein folding with molecular dynamics for a relatively short time , and then analyzing the resulting trajectories to extract a coarse - grained markov state model ( msm ) .",
    "an msm consists of an appropriate choice of long - lived clustered conformational states and the transition rates between them . to create an msm , one runs molecular dynamics simulations to determine how frequently a protein changes from one state to another , and clusters intermediate structures based on kinetic proximity ( e.g.",
    ", how energetically easy is switching from one structure to another ) .",
    "the transition rates are typically determined by averaging the time the protein takes to switch between any two states encoded in the msm .",
    "due to the coarse - grained nature of the msm , a continuous trajectory connecting a pair of sampled states might well enter first the phase - space basin belonging to another state without being trapped there .",
    "this occurrence , though unlikely , may dramatically affect the corresponding transition time .",
    "how to correctly generate the reactive trajectories representing a specific transition of interest for the msm is an issue of ongoing research .",
    "the contents of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ bistable ] we first simulate the relaxation of an overdamped brownian particle in a 1d potential well .",
    "we determine both numerically and analytically the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) for the particle to reach the bottom of the well from an injection point inside it .",
    "we show that when the injection point rests inside the well , but higher than the bottom of another adjacent well , then the rare trajectories crossing the barrier separating the two wells become dominant and , on lowering the noise level , the mfpt increases exponentially .",

    "[ multiwell ] we extend our analysis to the case of multiwell potentials and conclude that the mfpt inside a well is dominated by barrier - crossing anytime the particle s injection point rests above the level of the lowest lying among all adjacent wells ( sec . [ threewellnondeg ] ) .",

    "many systems in condensed matter are described by an overdamped particle that diffuses on a disordered energy landscape of appropriate dimensionality , without ever reaching a proper equilibrium state ( glassy materials are a good example ) .",

    "this difficulty can be circumvented by a more restrictive definition of locally stable state .",
    "our analysis clearly shows that in 1d the relaxation times within a single potential well or between degenerate wells can be determined by ignoring additional potential wells only under the condition that the energy of what we call the injection point is sufficiently close to the energy of the well bottom .",
    "how close , it depends on the actual distribution of the wells along the potential landscape .",
    "indeed , the critical threshold is determined by the lowest lying well , an information usually unavailable to the investigator .",
    "therefore , above a certain ( but unknown ) threshold of the injection energy , the measured relaxation times exhibit a marked _ nonlocal _ dependence on the global potential profile .",
    "such a nonlocal effect is due to the contribution from slower , though rare , relaxation trajectories , which explore the potential landscape surrounding the well(s ) of interest .",

    "<S> we investigate both analytically and by numerical simulation the relaxation of an overdamped brownian particle in a 1d multiwell potential . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mean relaxation time from an injection point inside the well down to its bottom is dominated by statistically rare trajectories that sample the potential profile outside the well . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> also the hopping time between two degenerate wells can depend on the detailed multiwell structure of the entire potential . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal nature of the transitions between two states of a disordered landscape is important for the correct interpretation of the relaxation rates in complex chemical - physical systems , measured either through numerical simulations or experimental techniques . </S>"
