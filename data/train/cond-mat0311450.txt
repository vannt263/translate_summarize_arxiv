    "recent years have seen a strong development of numerical and theoretical studies of simple liquid models , attempting to develop a thermodynamic description based on formalisms which could be extended to deal also with out - of - equilibrium ( glassy ) states  @xcite .",
    "hard spheres , soft spheres , lennard jones mixtures and simple molecular liquids  @xcite have been extensively studied . within the potential energy landscape ( pel )  @xcite thermodynamic approach , detailed comparisons between numerical data and theoretical predictions have been performed .",
    "estimates of the number @xmath0 of local minima basins as a function of the basin depth and of their shape have been recently evaluated for a few models  @xcite and from the analysis of experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the pel approach , which is particularly well suited for describing supercooled liquids , provides a controlled way to extrapolate the thermodynamic properties of the liquid state below the lowest temperature at which equilibrated data can be collected .",
    "for example , estimates of the locus where the configurational entropy vanishes , the so - called kauzmann locus , can be given  @xcite ; the kauzmann locus provides a theoretical limit to the metastable liquid state at low temperatures .",
    "another limit to the liquid state is met on superheating and stretching the liquid , when the nucleation of the gas phase takes place . in this case a convenient way to define the limit of stability of the liquid state against gas nucleation is provided by the spinodal line , i.e. , the locus of point where the compressibility diverges  @xcite .",
    "the kauzmann line and the spinodal line define the region of phase space where the liquid can exist in stable or metastable thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "recent theoretical and numerical work has focused on the thermodynamic relation between these two curves  @xcite .",
    "a recent thermodynamic analysis  @xcite suggests that the spinodal and the kauzmann loci meet in the @xmath1 plane with the same slope at a point corresponding to the maximum tension that the supercooled liquid can sustain .",
    "simple models which can be solved analytically , as hard  @xcite or soft  @xcite spheres complemented by a mean field attractive potential , support such prediction .",
    "a numerical study of a lennard jones mixture is also consistent  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the lewis and wahnstrm rigid model for the fragile glass former ortho - terphenyl ( otp )  @xcite , whose dynamic  @xcite and thermodynamic features  @xcite have been studied in detail .",
    "our aim is to calculate the spinodal and the kauzmann lines to estimate the region of stability of the liquid , and study the relation between these two loci .",
    "we improve the data base of phase state points of previous studies  @xcite , extending to both lower and higher densities and to higher temperatures . performing analysis of the pressure - volume relation along several isotherms",
    ", we estimate the homogeneous nucleation line and the spinodal curve ; we also report upgraded estimates of the statistical properties of the landscape sampled by the liquid .",
    "we confirm that at all densities a gaussian landscape properly models the thermodynamics of the system in the supercooled state . such agreement gives us confidence in the evaluation of the locus along which the configurational entropy vanishes .",
    "we finally discuss the limits and possibilities of an analysis based on the inherent structures thermodynamic formalism .",
    "the description of our results is preceded by a short review of the potential energy landscape approach to the thermodynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "an expression for the liquid free energy in the range of temperatures where the liquid is supercooled can be given within the pel formalism .",
    "in supercooled states , i.e. , when the correlation functions show the two steps behavior typical of the cage effect  @xcite , the system s properties are controlled by the statistical properties of the pel  @xcite . in the pel formalism , the potential energy hyper - surface fixed at constant volume is partitioned into basins ; each basin is defined as the set of points such that a steepest descent path originating from them ends in the same local minimum .",
    "the configuration corresponding to the minimum is called inherent structure ( is ) , of energy @xmath2 and pressure @xmath3 .",
    "the partition function can be expressed as the sum over all the basins , weighted by the appropriate boltzmann factor , i.e. , as a sum over the single basin s partition functions . as a result ,",
    "the helmholtz liquid free energy @xmath4 , at temperature @xmath5 and volume @xmath6 , can be written as  @xcite : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the average energy of the is explored at the given @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the vibrational free energy , i.e. , the average free energy of the system when constrained in a basin of depth @xmath2 , and @xmath11 is the configurational entropy , that counts the number of explored basins .",
    "@xmath11 is a quantity of crucial interest , both for comparing numerical results with the recent theoretical calculations  @xcite , and to examine some of the proposed relations between dynamics and thermodynamics  @xcite .",

    "numerically , @xmath10 is evaluated as sum of two contributions : _",
    "i ) _ a harmonic contribution , which depends on the curvature of the accessed basins corresponding to the minimum at the given @xmath2 ; _ ii ) _ an anharmonic contribution , usually approximated as a function of @xmath5 only . in the case of a rigid molecule model ,",
    "the harmonic contribution is the free energy associated with a system of @xmath16 independent oscillators of frequency @xmath17 , where the @xmath17 are the square root of the eigenvalues of the system hessian matrix the matrix of the second derivatives of the potential energy evaluated at the basin minimum ( see ref .",

    "finally , @xmath22 can be calculated as the difference of the ( total ) entropic part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeenergy ] ) and the vibrational contribution to the entropy : @xmath23",
    "in order to evaluate analitically the free energy in the pel formalism , it is necessary to provide a model for the probability distribution of @xmath2 , i.e. , the number @xmath24 of basins whose depth lies between @xmath2 and @xmath25 . among several possibilities , the gaussian distribution  @xcite seems to provide a satisfactory description of the numerical simulations of refs .",
    "the `` gaussian landscape '' is defined by : @xmath26 here , the amplitude @xmath27 accounts for the total number of basins , @xmath28 plays the role of energy scale and @xmath29 , measures the width of the distribution .",
    "one can grasp the origin of such distribution invoking the central limit theorem .",

    "<S> we estimate the location of the homogeneous liquid - gas nucleation line and of the spinodal locus . within the potential energy landscape formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the distributions of depth , number , and shape of the potential energy minima and show that the statistical properties of the landscape are consistent with a gaussian distribution of minima over a wide range of volumes . </S>",
    "<S> we report the volume dependence of the parameters entering in the gaussian distribution ( amplitude , average energy , variance ) . </S>",
