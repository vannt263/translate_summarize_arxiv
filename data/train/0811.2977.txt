    "the general view of the physics of the quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is that their energy output is due to accretion of matter on to a massive black hole ( e.g. , blandford 1991 ; antonucci 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "analysis of the spectrum is very important in understanding the physical nature of the underlying flow .",
    "the observed spectral and timing properties of galactic black holes indicate that the accretion flow around a black hole may have two components ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al .",
    "2002 ; choudhury & rao 2004 ; pottschmidt et al . 2006 ; smith et al . 2007 ) : an optically thick and geometrically thin keplerian accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) on the equatorial plane and an optically thin sub - keplerian flow ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ; chakrabarti & mandal 2006 ) sandwiching the keplerian disk .",
    "the keplerian disk produces a multi - colour black body spectrum and the soft photons from the keplerian disk are inverse comptonized by a hot electron cloud close to the black hole . in the literature",
    "many proposals have been put forward for the comptonizing region ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1985 ; haardt 1994 ; poutanen & svensson 1996 ) which are ranging from hot compton cloud to corona above accretion keplerian disks . in a departure from this approach , chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 )",
    "proposed that both the so - called compton cloud and soft - photon supplier are in fact dynamically important components .",
    "this model has a hot region produced due to a shock transition in presence of the centrifugal force in the sub - keplerian flow and is known as the cenbol ( centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ) . in the present model , the cenbol is responsible for producing the high - energy spectrum from an accretion disk .",
    "this two - component nature of the accretion disk can be treated as a general model where the accretion rates of both the components can be varied independently and the model should be applicable for all the black hole candidates ( belonging to the usual quasars and agns to nano - quasars or stellar mass black holes ) .",
    "it is well known that the big - blue bump in an agn spectrum is the signature of the keplerian disk and a number of spectra from the core of agns have been successfully fitted ( sun & malkan 1989 ) by a standard disk model . on the other hand ,",
    "an object such as m87 does not seem to have the big - blue bump in its spectrum and one should require only a hot electron component , such as a sub - keplerian flow , to interpret the observed spectrum . fortunately , the same cenbol component is capable of launching an outflow ( chakrabarti , 1999 ) which manifests itself as a strong jet coming out of a region from within a few tens of schwarzschild radii ( junor , biretta & livio , 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted profiles of the lines emitted from the sub - keplerian component also seem to agree with observed profiles from hst ( chakrabarti , 1995 ) .    in this _",
    ", we calculate the spectra of two - component accretion disks around stellar mass to super - massive black holes .",
    "this helps us to understand the basic functions of the components of the flow from an unifying view by varying only the mass .",
    "we then apply our model to the case of m87 by considering a purely sub - keplerian disk around it .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in  2 , we describe the model properties and the general nature of the spectrum . in  3 , we explain the spectrum of m87 and finally , in  4 , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a vertically averaged two - component flow around a schwarzschild black hole . the black hole geometry is described by a pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) and the vertical height of the accretion disk at any radial distance has been calculated by balancing the vertical component of gravitational force with the gas pressure ( chakrabarti 1989 ) .",
    "the radial distance is measured in units of the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath0 ) , where @xmath1 is gravitational constant , @xmath2 is mass of the black hole and @xmath3 is speed of light .",
    "the parameters of our model are : the shock location ( @xmath4 ) , the compression ratio ( @xmath5 ) of the shock ( i.e. , the ratio of the post - shock to pre - shock densities ) , the fraction of electrons having non - thermal distribution of energy ( @xmath6 ) and the accretion rates of the keplerian ( @xmath7 ) and the sub - keplerian halo ( @xmath8 ) components .",
    "the accretion rates are measured in units of the eddington rates ( @xmath9 for @xmath10 black hole ) . in the absence of a satisfactory description of magnetic fields inside the accretion disk",
    ", we consider the presence of only stochastic fields and use the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the gravitational energy density to be a parameter ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath12 throughout this paper .",
    "the condition of the plasma at the outer boundary of the accretion disk is uncertain because the processes of feeding a black hole are not well - known .",
    "it depends on the type of the donor star ( bath & shaviv 1976 ) supplying matter in a compact binary or the condition of the ism for agn .",
    "we have fixed the outer boundary at @xmath13 .",
    "the injection temperatures of the electron and proton for stellar - mass black hole are given by the adiabatic bondi ( 1952 ) solution i.e. , @xmath14 which is consistent with the value found in the literature ( tavani & brookshaw 1995 ) .",
    "however , for agns , the outer boundary of the accretion disk could be cooler than that around a stellar - mass black hole as it contains the molecular or partially ionized gas . the temperature of the ionized gas lies in the range @xmath15 ( wilson & storchi - bergmann 1997 ) . as a example",
    ", we have taken the temperature at the outer boundary for a super - massive black hole as @xmath16 . in the case of m87",
    ", the existence of an ionized disk has been discussed in the literature ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ; harms et al .",
    "1994 ) . in our model",
    ", we consider all the radiation processes , namely bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and compton scattering .",
    "since the shocks are the natural outcome of a sub - keplerian flow , we consider that the pre - shock electrons follow a pure thermal distribution while the post - shock flow is a mixture of thermal and non - thermal electrons .",
    "this is because some electrons would be accelerated due to usual back and forth diffusion and compression across the shock ( see , mandal & chakrabarti 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the slope ( @xmath17 of the non - thermal distribution depends on the compression ratio ( @xmath5 ) and it produces a synchrotron spectrum of power - law index [ @xmath18 with a sharp cut - off determined by the lorentz factor ( @xmath19 ) of the accelerated electrons .",
    "we have taken this effect also in calculating the spectrum from the accretion disk .",
    "agns are known to have very strong jets and in the core / nuclear region these jets are not separable from the accretion disk .",
    "so , the spectrum from the core will always have some contribution from the jet .",
    "there could be several hot regions which emit radio , optical and x - ray radiation along the jet but these regions are separable from the nucleus .",
    "understanding these high energy emissions require separate physical processes which are outside the scope of the present work . in our present calculation",
    "we are mainly interested the spectrum from the nucleus and have used a simplified model for the jet and added this contribution to the spectrum from the accretion disk .",
    "we have assumed that 10% of matter from the accretion disk is launched from the location of the cenbol as jet with the same temperature as that of cenbol .",
    "we have taken a cylindrical jet and solve the energy equations along the jet .",
    "the jet is assumed to cool down due to synchrotron emission .    in fig .",
    "1 we show a typical accretion disk spectrum for a stellar mass black hole ( the so - called nano - quasar ) to a super - massive black hole ( quasar ) with all the components computed from our model .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath20 .",
    "the contribution from the bremsstrahlung radiation is negligible for a stellar - mass black hole but it is significant for a super - massive black hole due to a lower temperature and larger emitting volume of the accretion disk .",
    "the pre - shock synchrotron radiation is huge for a stellar - mass black hole due to the large injection temperature whereas it is insignificant for a super - massive black hole .",
    "the comptonized spectrum of the black body photons gets harder as the black hole mass increases .",
    "this is due to fact that for the same value of accretion rate ( in eddington unit ) the density of the flow goes down with the mass and hence the optical depth of the flow decreases .",
    "but the comptonized spectrum of the synchrotron photons becomes softer with the increase of the black hole mass .",
    "the ratio ( @xmath21 ) of the photon energy density to the magnetic energy density represents the relative contribution of the inverse - compton process .",
    "we find that for the stellar mass black hole @xmath22 whereas for the super - massive case @xmath23 only .",
    "the jet , which is emitted from cenbol , can have a big contribution in the radio range for the super - massive case due to its large volume .",
    "so , the radio emission from the nucleus of the agn will be contributed by the jets .",
    "we also note a frequency shift towards the lower end as the potential energy release itself decreases with increasing mass .",
    "though generally speaking , the spectrum of a super - massive black hole will have all the components of that of a stellar mass black hole , we show below that m87 could be fitted by considering a pure sub - keplerian flow as it does not seem to have a so - called big blue bump .",
    "this was also noted by perlman et al .",
    "the elliptical galaxy m87 contains a super - massive black hole of mass @xmath24 ( macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ) at the centre and the inclination angle of the accretion disk with the line of sight is @xmath25 ( ford et al . 1994 ; chakrabarti , 1995 ) .",
    "it is a low luminosity agn located in the virgo cluster at a distance of @xmath26 ( tonry et al .",
    "2001 ) having a prominent one - sided jet .",
    "the central luminosity of the accretion disk is @xmath27 ergs / s ( biretta , stern & harris , 1991 ) which is at least two orders of magnitude below the luminosity expected for a standard thin accretion disk accreting at the bondi rate @xmath28 ( di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the literature ,",
    "different explanations for the low luminosity of m87 have been given .",
    "the wave - particle resonance can efficiently couple the electrons and ions ( begelman & chiueh 1988 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2000 ; quataert 1998 ; quataert & gruzinov 1999 ; blackman 1999 ) to produce a geometrically thin cool disk .",
    "jolley & kuncic ( 2007 ) argued that this low luminosity is due to a thin cool disk accreting matter in a very low rate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the coupling between electrons and ions are unable to equilibrate them within the infall time - scale and if the ions are preferentially heated by viscous dissipation , the accreting matter can not radiate its internal energy before reaching the black hole .",
    "this leads to a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "according to this model the low luminosity is due to low radiative efficiency ( di matteo et al .",
    "2000 ) rather than a low mass accretion rate .",
    "but our approach is different from the above two in the sense that our accretion disk is neither a cool keplerian disk because the observation data shows a flat spectrum rather than a blue bump nor a riaf .",
    "ours is simply a sub - keplerian transonic flow ( chakrabarti , 1990 ) which is equipped with a standing shock wave .",
    "this is fundamentally inefficient as the infall time is too short .",
    "the observed luminosity from the nucleus is likely to be less than the total accretion power because most of the energy is carried inside the black hole ( in fact , a perfectly stable solution will exist even if the energy loss is zero . ) and rest is used to power the jet . in the case of m87 the total kinetic power of the jet",
    "is estimated to be @xmath29 ergs / s ( reynolds et al .",
    "also , the jet is produced from a central region not more than a few tens of @xmath30 ( junor , biretta & livio 1999 ) which is expected from our cenbol paradigm for the origin of jet ( chakrabarti , 1999 ) .",
    "there are several works in the literature which favor the sub - keplerian flow scenario .",
    "for example , it is believed that the low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liner ) of m87 are produced due to the shock excitation in a dissipative accretion ( dopita et al .",
    "chakrabarti ( 1995 ) calculated the velocity field of the ionized disk using a spiral shock solution and comparing the shapes of the line profiles expected from various regions of the ionized disk with the hst observation data , the mass of the central object of m87 was found to be @xmath31 which is consistent with the presently accepted value .",
    "we have collected the broadband ( radio , optical to x - ray ) data from several previous works ( ho , 1999 ; reimer et al . 2004 ) in the literature .",
    "the details are given in table 1 . in fig .",
    "2 , we fitted these data by our model .",
    "we chose the parameters to be @xmath32 to fit the data .",
    "the upper limit of the keplerian disk rate is found to be @xmath33 for any decent fit .",
    "this indicates that the keplerian disk is not important for m87 and the bulk motion comptonization effect is negligible due to the small accretion rate required .",
    "the jet has a large contribution in the radio range due to high electron temperature and large volume .",
    "the low energy data are well fitted by the thermal synchrotron radiation from the jet and the synchrotron emission produced by the cool pre - shock flow is insignificant .",
    "but the radio data ( open triangles ) which have a very high spatial resolution are very close to the pre - shock synchrotron spectrum",
    ". this radio contribution may be due to the accretion disk or it may be due the different observation epoch when the radio activity in the jet is very dim .",
    "the bremsstrahlung radiation has a small contribution only in the soft x - ray range . a shock of compression ratio @xmath34 produces a non - thermal synchrotron spectrum of slope ( @xmath35 ) which explains the flat part ( @xmath36 for @xmath34 ) of the observed spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with the previous finding that at this @xmath5 , the outflow rate is also most significant ( chakrabarti , 1999 ) .",
    "the sharp cut - off in the synchrotron spectrum is due to cut - off in the non - thermal distribution of electrons and it is determined by the value of @xmath19 mentioned above .",
    "the synchrotron self - comptonized spectrum due to non - thermal electrons matches with the chandra data which measures the core luminosity very accurately .",
    "we find the total bolometric luminosity of the nucleus as @xmath37 ergs / sec .",
    "most of the model of m87 are based on the emission from the jet only but we have shown that the spectrum from the nucleus can be understood by an accretion disk model with a contribution from the jet in the radio range .",
    "the acceleration of electrons to a relativistic energy and the role of the relativistic electrons in producing the high energy emission from the jet may be important to study the spectra from the knots .",
    "in the _ letter _ , we calculated the spectra from generalized two - component advective accretion disks located around stellar mass and super - massive black holes .",
    "specifically , we applied our method for the agn m87 , perhaps the most massive black hole candidate known .",
    "we find that only the sub - keplerian component is enough to describe the black hole spectrum very satisfactorily . in a sub - keplerian disk ,",
    "the flow is almost freely falling and the infall time scale for m87 in the cenbol region ( @xmath38 tens of @xmath30 ) is order of few months . not surprisingly , the observed variability of the core of m87 in optical / x - ray wavelength is reported to be of the order of a few months ( perlman et al .",
    "2003 ; harris , biretta & junor 1997 ) , supporting our view . for a keplerian disk",
    "the viscous time scale would be a few orders of magnitude higher .",
    "out fit with a sub - keplerian flow alone is excellent .",
    "what is more , since the shocks are produced in sub - keplerian flows , the shock - acceleration provides a natural explanation for the flat spectrum .",
    "the jets which are produced from cenbol also contribute to the radio emission .",
    "the non - thermal tail due to comptonization of the synchrotron photons fits the chandra data and we believe that it extends at least a few tens of mev . at higher energies , one may have to consider the hadronic interactions which is beyond the scope of the present _ letter_.      antonucci , r. 1993 , arabia , 31 , 473 bath , g.t .",
