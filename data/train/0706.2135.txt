    "aging has become one of the main paradigms to describe the long - time behavior of complex and/or disordered systems .",
    "systems that have strongly motivated this research are _ spin glasses _ , where aging was first observed experimentally in the anomalous relaxation patterns of the magnetization @xcite .",
    "the theoretical modeling of aging phenomena took a major leap with the introduction of so - called _ trap models _ by bouchaud and dean in the early 1990ies @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these models reproduce the characteristic power law behavior seen experimentally while being sufficiently simple to allow for detailed analytical treatment .",
    "while trap models are heuristically motivated to capture the behavior of the dynamics of spin glass models , there is no clear theoretical , let alone mathematical derivation of these from an underlying spin - glass dynamics . the first attempt to establish such a connection was made in @xcite where it was shown that starting from a particular glauber dynamics of the random energy model ( rem ) , at low temperatures and at the time scale slightly shorter than the equilibration time of the dynamics , the aging of the time - time correlation function of the dynamics converged to that given by bouchaud s rem - like trap model .    on the other hand , in a series of papers @xcite a systematic investigation of a variety of trap models",
    "was initiated . in this process",
    ", it emerged that there appears to be an almost universal aging mechanism based on @xmath7-stable subordinators that governs aging in most of the trap models .",
    "it was also shown that the same feature holds for the dynamics of the rem at shorter time scales than those considered in @xcite , and that this also happens at high temperature provided appropriate time scales are considered @xcite .",
    "for a general review on trap models see @xcite .    in all models considered so far ,",
    "however , the random variables describing the quenched disorder were considered to be independent , be it in the rem or in the trap models . aging in correlated spin glass models",
    "was investigated rigorously only in some cases of spherical sk models and at very short time scales @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show for the first time that the same type of aging mechanism is relevant also in correlated spin glasses , at least on time scales that are short compared to equilibration time ( but exponentially large in the volume of the system ) .",
    "let us first describe the class of models we are considering .",
    "our state spaces will be the @xmath1-dimensional hypercube , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 $ ] denotes as usual the normalized overlap , @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-spin sk - model is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the centered normal process indexed by @xmath15 with covariance @xmath16=r_n(\\sigma , \\tau ) ^p,\\ ] ] and @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath19 the @xmath20-algebra generated by the random variables @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding gibbs measure is then given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the normalizing partition function .    we define the classical trap - model dynamics as a nearest neighbor continuous time markov chain @xmath24 on @xmath15 with transition rates @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the graph distance on the hypercube , @xmath27 a simple way to construct this dynamics is as a time change of a simple random walk on @xmath15 : we denote by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the simple unbiased random walk ( srw ) on @xmath15 started at some fixed point of @xmath15 , say at @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath3 we define the _ clock - process _ by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a sequence of mean - one i.i.d .  exponential random variables .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the @xmath20-algebra generated by the srw random variables @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath37-algebra generated by the random variables @xmath38 will be denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "then the process @xmath24 can be written as @xmath40 obviously , @xmath41 is reversible with respect to the measure @xmath42 .",
    "we will consider all random processes to be defined on an abstract probability space @xmath43 .",
    "note that the three @xmath20-algebras @xmath19 , @xmath33 , and @xmath39 are all independent under @xmath44 .",
    "we will systematically use the definition of the dynamics given by or .",
    "this is the same as was used in the analysis of the rem and in most work on trap models .",
    "it differs substantially from more popular dynamics such as the metropolis or the heat - bath algorithm .",
    "the main difference is that in these dynamics the trajectories are not independent of the environment and are biased against going up in energy .",
    "this may have a substantial effect on the dynamics , and we do not know whether our results will apply also ( with some modifications ) in these cases .",
    "the fact is that we currently do not have the tools to analyze these dynamics even in the case of the rem !",
    "let @xmath45 be the @xmath46-stable subordinator with the laplace transform given by @xmath47=\\exp(-t\\lambda^\\alpha ) .\\ ] ] the main technical result on the dynamics will be the following theorem that provides the asymptotic behavior of the clock process .",
    "[ t : main ] there exists a function @xmath48 such that for all @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 under the conditional distribution @xmath52 $ ] the law of the stochastic process @xmath53 defined on the the space of cdlg functions equipped with the skorokhod @xmath54-topology , converges , @xmath33-a.s .",
    ", to the law of @xmath55-stable subordinator @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a positive constant depending on @xmath50 , @xmath58 and @xmath0",
    ".    moreover , the function @xmath48 is increasing and it satisfies @xmath59    we will explain in section  [ s : clock ] what the @xmath54-topology is .",
    "roughly , it is a weak topology that does not convey much information at the jumps of the limiting process : it can be the case that the approximating processes jumps several times at rather short distances to produce one bigger jump of the limit process .",
    "this will actually be the case in our models for @xmath60 , while it is not the case in the rem .",
    "therefore we can not replace the @xmath54 topology with the stronger @xmath61-topology in theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "to control the behavior of spin - spin correlation functions that are commonly used to characterize aging , we need to know more on how these jumps occur at finite @xmath1 . what we will show , is that if we the slightly coarse - grain the process @xmath62 over blocks of size @xmath63 , the rescaled process does converge in the @xmath61-topology .",
    "what this says , is that the jumps of the limiting process are compounded by smaller jumps that are made over @xmath64 steps of the srw . in other words , the jumps of the limiting process come from waiting times accumulated in one slightly extended trap , and during this entire time only a negligible fraction of the spins are flipped .",
    "that will imply the following aging result .",

    "@xmath72 is the time - scale at which we want to observe the process . according to theorem  [ t : main ] ,",
    "at this time the random walk will make of the order of @xmath73 steps . since this number is also much smaller than @xmath74 ( as follows from )",
    ", the random walk will essentially visit that number of sites .    if the random process @xmath75 was i.i.d .",
    ",  then the maximum of @xmath75 along the trajectory would be @xmath76 , and the time spent in that site would be of order @xmath77 .",
    "since theorem  [ t : main ] holds also in the i.i.d .  case , that is in the rem ( see @xcite ) , the time spent in the maximum is comparable to the total time and the convergence to the @xmath46-stable subordinator implies that the total accumulated time is composed of pieces of order @xmath72 that are collected along the trajectory . in fact , each jump of the subordinator corresponds to one visit to a site that has waiting times of that order . in a common metaphor , the sites",
    "are referred to as traps and the mean waiting times as their depths .",
    "the theorem in the general case states that in the @xmath0-spin model , the same is essentially true .",
    "the difference will be that the traps here will not consist of a single site , but consist of a deep valley ( along the trajectory ) whose bottom that has approximately the same energy as in the i.i.d .",
    "case and whose shape and width we will be able to describe quite precisely . remarkably , the number of sites contributing significantly to the residence time in the valley is essentially finite , and different valleys are statistically independent .    the fact that traps are finite may appear quite surprising to those familiar with the statics of @xmath0-spin models . from the results there ( see @xcite ) , it is known that the gibbs measure concentrates on `` lumps '' whose diameter is of order @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the mystery is however solved easily : the process @xmath80 does indeed decreases essentially linearly with speed @xmath81 from a local maximum .",
    "thus , the residence times in such sites decrease geometrically , so that the contributions of a neighborhood of size @xmath57 of a local maximum amounts to a fraction of @xmath82 of the total time spend in that valley ; for the support of the gibbs measure , one needs however to take into account the entropy , that is that the volumes of the balls of radius @xmath83 increases like @xmath84 . for the dynamics , at least at our time - scales , this is , however , irrelevant , since the srw leaves a local minimum essentially ballistically .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : main ] relies on the combination of detailed information on the properties of simple random walk on the hypercube , which is provided in section  [ s : rwprop ] ( but see also @xcite ) , and comparison of the process @xmath75 on the trajectory of the srw to a simpler gaussian process using interpolation techniques  la slepian , familiar from extreme value theory of gaussian processes .",
    "let us explain this in more detail .",
    "on the time scales we are considering , the srw makes @xmath85 steps . in this regime",
    "the srw is extremely `` transient '' , in the sense that ( i ) starting from a given point @xmath86 , for a times @xmath87 , the distance from @xmath86 grows essentially linearly with speed one , that is there are no backtrackings with high probability ; ( ii ) the srw will _ never _ return to a neighborhood of size @xmath88 of the starting point @xmath86 , with high probability .",
    "the upshot is that we can think of the trajectory of the srw essentially as of a straight line .",
    "next we consider the gaussian process restricted to the srw trajectory .",
    "we expect that the main contributions to the sums @xmath89 come from places where @xmath90 is maximal ( on the trajectory ) .",
    "we expect that the distribution of these extremes do not feel the correlation between points farther than @xmath88 apart . on the other hand , for points closer than @xmath88",
    ", the correlation function @xmath91 can be well approximated by a linear function @xmath92 ( using that @xmath93 ) .",
    "this is convenient since this process has an explicit representation in terms of i.i.d .",
    "random variables that allow for explicit computations ( in fact , this is one of the famous slepian processes for which the extremal distribution can be computed explicitly @xcite ) .",
    "thus the idea is to cut the srw trajectory into blocks of length @xmath88 and to replace the original process @xmath94 by a new one @xmath95 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are independent , if @xmath97 are not in the same block , and @xmath98=1 - 2p|i - j|/n$ ] if they are .",
    "for the new process , theorem [ t : main ] is relatively straightforward .",
    "the main step is the computation of laplace transforms in section  [ s : oneblock ] .",
    "comparing the real process with the auxiliary one is the bulk of the work and is done in section  [ s : compar ] .",
    "the properties of srw needed are established in section  [ s : rwprop ] . in section  [",
    "s : clock ] we present the proofs of the main theorems .",
    "our results here show some universality of the rem for dynamics of @xmath0-spin models with @xmath49 .",
    "this dynamic universality is close to the static universality of the rem , which shows that various features of the landscape of energies ( that is of the hamiltonian @xmath75 ) are insensitive to correlations .",
    "this static universality in a microcanonical context has been introduced by @xcite ( see @xcite for rigorous results on spin - glasses ) .",
    "the static results closest to our dynamics question are given in @xcite where it is shown that the statistics of extreme values for the restriction of @xmath75 to a random sets @xmath99 are universal , for @xmath49 and @xmath100 , for @xmath101 small enough .",
