    "homoclinic tangencies , i.e. tangencies between stable and unstable invariant manifolds of the same saddle periodic orbit , play a very important role in the theory of dynamical chaos . starting with the works by smale and shilnikov  @xcite ( and in the ideological sense as far back as with the memoirs by poincar and birkhoff  @xcite ) ,",
    "the existence of transversal homoclinic intersections is considered as the universal criterium of the complexity of dynamical systems . at the same time , the presence of non - transversal homoclinic orbits ( homoclinic tangencies ) indicates an extraordinary richness of bifurcations of such systems and , what is very important , the principal impossibility of providing of a complete description of bifurcations of such systems within framework of finite parameter families ,  @xcite .",
    "therefore , when studying homoclinic bifurcations , the main problems are related to the analysis of their principal bifurcations and characteristic properties of dynamics as a whole .",
    "one of the important properties of homoclinic tangencies is that they can freely produce homoclinic and heteroclinic tangencies of higher orders  @xcite . in particular , in a two parameter family which unfolds generally a quadratic homoclinic tangency , cubic homoclinic tangencies appear unavoidably .",
    "this means that the study of bifurcations of cubic homoclinic tangencies itself becomes an important problem .",
    "moreover , cubic homoclinic tangencies can play an independent role when studying global bifurcations in many dynamical models . for example , such tangencies appear naturally in the problem on periodically perturbed two - dimensional flows with a homoclinic figure - eight of a saddle equilibrium  @xcite , where the corresponding bifurcation points of codimension two give rise to the curves of quadratic homoclinic tangencies forming ( non - smooth ) boundaries of homoclinic zones .",
    "moreover , bifurcations of cubic tangencies lead to the appearance of specific windows of stability ( i.e. parameter domains corresponding to the existence of stable periodic orbits ) which are well observable during numerical explorations ,  @xcite , unlike the windows produced by quadratic homoclinic tangencies .",
    "in fact , bifurcations of cubic homoclinic tangencies were studied first in  @xcite for the sectionally dissipative case ( when a saddle periodic orbit has eigenvalues @xmath0 such that @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , see also  @xcite .",
    "note that in  @xcite the two main cases were considered when the leading stable eigenvalue is real ( i.e. @xmath3 ) and the two leading eigenvalues are complex conjugate ( i.e. @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the main attention in  @xcite was focused on the study of bifurcations of _ single - round periodic orbits _ ,",
    "i.e. periodic orbits which pass a neighborhood of the homoclinic orbit only once .",
    "we note that the study of such orbits can be reduced to an analysis of fixed points of the corresponding first return maps defined near some point of the homoclinic tangency . in the case of cubic tangencies",
    ", such maps can be brought to the maps close to the two - dimensional cubic hnon maps of the form @xmath7 being @xmath8 and @xmath9 parameters and @xmath10 the jacobian",
    ". moreover , map  @xmath11 appears in the case of cubic tangency incoming from below ( figure  [ fig2type](a ) ) and map  @xmath12 arises in the case of cubic tangency incoming from above ( figure  [ fig2type](b ) ) . in the dissipative case @xmath13 , maps  ( [ cubhm ] ) with @xmath14 were derived ( using the rescaling method ,  @xcite ) in  @xcite , where the corresponding formulas for the rescaled first return maps near homoclinic tangencies of arbitrary finite orders were obtained .",
    "it is worth mentioning that maps  @xmath12 and  @xmath11 were studied in  @xcite for the dissipative case  @xmath15 , where bifurcation diagrams for fixed points and 2-periodic orbits were constructed analytically as well as strange attractors were analyzed numerically .",
    "also maps  ( [ cubhm ] ) are good approximations of the corresponding rescaling first return maps  @xmath16 when the return time  @xmath17 is sufficiently large ( in fact ,  @xmath17 is the period of a single - round periodic orbit under consideration ) .",
    "then @xmath18 and @xmath19 are rescaled coordinates and parameters , respectively , which are defined in domains @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 as  @xmath23 , the jacobian @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath14 in the dissipative case and  @xmath25 in the conservative case ) , and the error terms are of order  @xmath26 .        in the present paper",
    "we study bifurcations of single - round periodic orbits in the case of two - dimensional symplectic maps with cubic homoclinic tangencies .",
    "we put emphasis on bifurcations leading to the birth of elliptic periodic orbits .",
    "the main results can be briefly formulated as follows    let @xmath27 , @xmath28 , be a two parameter family of symplectic maps unfolding generally the cubic homoclinic tangency to the saddle fixed point @xmath29 with eigenvalues @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a small neighborhood of the origin in the @xmath34-plane .",
    "then the following holds    1 .   in @xmath33 , there exists a bifurcation curve ( semicubical parabola )  @xmath35 with the cusp - point @xmath36 such that for @xmath37 , map  @xmath27 has a quadratic homoclinic tangency branched from the initial cubic tangency .",
    "2 .   in @xmath33",
    ", there exists an infinite sequence of elliptic zones @xmath38 accumulated to @xmath35 as @xmath23 such that for @xmath39 , map  @xmath27 has an elliptic single - round orbit of period @xmath17 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath38 consists of curves @xmath40 and @xmath41 corresponding to the appearance of single - round periodic orbits with double eigenvalues @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the elliptic orbit is generic for all values of @xmath44 , except for those belonging to the strong 1:3 and 1:4 resonance curves @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( the orbit has eigenvalues @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and the non - twist curve @xmath49 ( the first birkhoff coefficient equals zero ) .",
    "[ thm : main ]    an illustration to theorem  [ thm : main ] is shown in figure  [ fig : bdiagr2 ] .",
    "we see that the bifurcation diagrams for single - round periodic orbits are different in the cases ( a )  @xmath50 and the tangency is incoming from below ; ( b )  @xmath50 and the tangency is incoming from above ; ( c )  @xmath51 .",
    "correspondingly , we label zones  @xmath38 as  @xmath52 ( squids ) in the case ( a ) and  @xmath53 ( cockroaches ) in the case ( b ) .",
    "notice that in the case @xmath51 zones  @xmath38 of different types alternate depending on the parity of  @xmath17 , and , therefore , for more definiteness , we enumerate these zones as @xmath54 .",
    "-plane , where curve  @xmath35 and elliptic zones  @xmath52 ( a ) and  @xmath55 ( b ) are shown .",
    "these zones alternate for @xmath51 ( c ) .",
    "curves  @xmath40 correspond to nondegenerate conservative fold bifurcations except for cusp - points  @xmath56 of conservative pitch - fork bifurcations .",
    "curves  @xmath41 correspond to nondegenerate conservative period doubling bifurcations except for points  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 of curve  @xmath41 of zone  @xmath53 where the first lyapunov value  @xmath59 vanishes . points  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 are the endpoints of bifurcation curves  @xmath60 and  @xmath61 that correspond to conservative fold bifurcations of double - round periodic orbits ( 2-periodic orbits in the first return maps).,height=264 ]    we prove theorem  [ thm : main ] at the end of section  [ sec : stateprob ] ( item  1 ) and section  [ sect : bifcub ] ( item  2 ) .",
    "the proof of item  2 of theorem  [ thm : main ] is mainly based on the rescaling results of lemma  [ henmain - c ] which show that the corresponding first return map  @xmath16 can be brought , by linear changes of coordinates and parameters , to a regular map asymptotically close as  @xmath23 to the conservative cubic hnon map of the form  ( [ cubhm ] ) with  @xmath25 . moreover , we obtain map  @xmath62 in the case of incoming from below tangency and map  @xmath63 in the case of incoming from above tangency ( in the case @xmath51 , maps  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 appear , respectively , for even and odd numbers  @xmath17 )",
    ". bifurcations of fixed points and accompanied bifurcations of 2-periodic orbits for these conservative cubic hnon maps are described in section  [ sect : cubichenon ] .",
    "the corresponding bifurcation diagrams are shown in figures  [ gk88-+2 ] and  [ gk882 ] for the maps  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we also give the analytical expressions for the corresponding bifurcation curves , see formulas  ( [ eq : criv ] ) .",
    "after this , the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] becomes quite straightforward , see section  [ sec : endofproof ] .",
    "note that in the symplectic case , one of the main questions when studying elliptic points is related to their generic properties . in the case of the conservative hnon map @xmath64",
    ", the problem of genericity ( stability ) of elliptic fixed points was completely solved in  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "concerning the conservative cubic hnon maps , the problem of genericity ( stability ) of fixed elliptic points has been ( almost completely ) solved in  @xcite , where conditions for the kam - stability of these points were obtained .",
    "note also that bifurcations of lower - periodic orbits ( of period 1 , 2 , 3 ) were also studied in  @xcite .    concerning 4-periodic orbits , in section  [ sec:14rez ] we carry out the corresponding bifurcation analysis paying main attention to those phenomena which are connected with the peculiarities of bifurcations of fixed points with eigenvalues @xmath65 , i.e. 1:4 resonance .",
    "we perform this study separately for map @xmath62 in section  [ sec:14rez+ ] and for map @xmath63 in section  [ sec:14rez- ] .",
    "note that the main complex local normal form of a map having a fixed point with eigenvalues @xmath48 can be written as follows ,  @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a parameter characterizing deviation of the angle argument @xmath68 of eigenvalues of the fixed point from  @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 are real and smoothly depend on  @xmath67 .",
    "then the following conditions ,  @xcite , @xmath73 imply that bifurcations of the fixed point in  ( [ hecomplnew13 ] ) are nondegenerate .",
    "we show that conditions  ( [ d21d03 ] ) can be violated for both maps  @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "namely , the case  @xmath74 occurs for map  @xmath62 and the equality  @xmath75 can hold for map  @xmath63 .",
    "this means that the structure of 1:4 resonance is different in these maps and we study the accompanied bifurcation phenomena in the present paper .",
    "as far as we know , the case @xmath76 , when the fixed point in the normal form  ( [ hecomplnew13 ] ) is a nonlinear center ( map  ( [ hecomplnew13 ] ) without  @xmath77 terms is a nonlinear rotation ) was not considered before .",
    "nevertheless , this case is very interesting from various points of view . in particular",
    ", the problem of the existence of quasi - central elliptic points in reversible analytical maps is very important . here , bifurcations of such points ( when the map is not conservative ) lead to the birth of pairs of periodic orbits sink - source and , as a consequence , to the break - down of conservativity and appearance of the so - called mixed dynamics  @xcite even inside symmetric elliptic islands  @xcite .",
    "[ rem01 ]    the case  @xmath75 of 1:4 resonance was considered in @xcite for the conservative hnon map , see also  @xcite . however , for the cubic hnon map  @xmath63 , the case  @xmath75 is of another ( more complicated ) structure .",
    "in particular , proper bifurcations of a fixed point with eigenvalues  @xmath48 are replaced here by extrinsic bifurcations of some 4-periodic orbits ( thus , 1:4 resonance demonstrates certain non - twist properties ) .",
    "[ rem02 ]    in the present paper we only study the most interesting and principal peculiarities of 1:4 resonance in maps  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to the analytical considerations , we also display certain numerical results in figures  [ pi2plusres ] and  [ fig_pi2-a1 ] .",
    "we plan to continue to study this in more detail in the nearest future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : stateprob ] we start with the statement of the problem and also present the results on the normal forms of symplectic saddle maps ( lemmas  [ lem : nfgen ] and  [ lem : tknfgen ] ) and the normal form of global map  @xmath78 defined near a homoclinic point ( lemma  [ nft1 ] ) .",
    "we also prove item 1 of theorem  [ thm : main ] in section  [ sec : stateprob ] , see proposition  [ th1g85 ] .",

    "the main technical result there is the rescaling lemma , lemma  [ henmain - c ] , which shows that the first return maps can be written , in some rescaling coordinates , as maps asymptotically close to the conservative cubic hnon maps  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 .",
    "once we know the structure of bifurcations of fixed points in these maps we can easily recover bifurcations of single - round periodic orbits and , hence , prove the theorem .",
    "in section  [ sec:14rez ] we consider the problem on the structure of 1:4 resonance in maps  @xmath62 and  @xmath63 .",
