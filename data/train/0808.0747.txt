    "electron anti - neutrinos from large commercial nuclear reactors are playing an important role in the exploration of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the choice of distance between source and detector allows one to conveniently tune an experiment s sensitivity to either the atmospheric or solar neutrino mass splitting .",
    "kamland  @xcite has established a connection between the msw effect in the sun  @xcite and vacuum oscillations with anti - neutrinos , and has provided the most accurate measurement of @xmath2 to date .",
    "earlier , chooz  @xcite and palo verde  @xcite provided what are still the best upper limits on the mixing angle @xmath3 .",
    "a variety of new experiments are being constructed to perform more sensitive measurements of the mixing angle @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "anti - neutrino detectors at very short distance are being explored with the purpose of detecting coherent neutrino - nucleon scattering ( c@xmath4ns )  @xcite , and for testing plutonium diversion at commercial reactors  @xcite .",
    "a proper understanding of the systematic effects involved in the modeling of the reactor anti - neutrino flux and energy spectrum is essential for these experiments .",
    "moreover , as most experiments measure @xmath0s from more than one reactor , it is important to understand not only the magnitude of these effects , but also the correlations between uncertainties from different sources .    except for the case of c@xmath4ns , which will not be addressed further here , reactor anti -",
    "neutrinos are usually detected using the inverse-@xmath5 reaction @xmath6 whose correlated signature helps reduce backgrounds but is only sensitive to @xmath1s with energy above 1.8 mev .",
    "the kinetic energy of the positron gives a measure of the incoming @xmath1 energy .",
    "neutrino oscillation parameters may be extracted from the data by fitting the observed @xmath0 spectrum @xmath7 to the following equation : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the number of target protons , @xmath10 is the energy - dependent detection efficiency , @xmath11 is the detection cross - section , @xmath12 is the oscillation survival probability for @xmath1s traveling a distance @xmath13 from reactor @xmath14 to the detector , and @xmath15 is the @xmath1 spectrum emitted by reactor @xmath14 .",
    "the time variation of the flux may be included in the fit to discriminate the time - varying reactor signal from constant backgrounds .",
    "equation  [ eq : nuebarspeccalc ] should technically be multiplied by the detector resolution function and integrated over @xmath16 , but this detail is inconsequential for our analysis .",
    "nuclear power reactors operate on the principle that the fission of u and pu isotopes and the subsequent decays of their daughter fragments release energy , generating heat .",
    "large q - value @xmath5-decays of unstable fission fragments are primarily responsible for the @xmath1 emission of nuclear reactors .",
    "decays of long - lived isotopes in the nuclear fuel and in spent fuel elements stored at the reactor site contribute at the sub - percent level to the detected @xmath1 flux ; this contribution has been treated elsewhere  @xcite and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "considering only fission reactions , the final term in equation  [ eq : nuebarspeccalc ] may be expanded as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath1 emission spectrum per fission of isotope @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the number of fissions of isotope @xmath19 during the data taking period . since @xmath2199.9% of the energy- and @xmath1-producing fissions are from @xmath22u , @xmath23u , @xmath24pu , and @xmath25pu  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : pv_fission_rates ] ) , the summation in equation  [ eq : reactoremissionspec ] is performed over just these 4 isotopes . for @xmath22u , @xmath24pu , and @xmath25pu ,",
    "the emitted @xmath1 spectra @xmath26 are derived from @xmath5-spectrum measurements of the fissioning of the isotopes by thermal neutrons  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath1 spectral shape derived from these measurements was investigated recently in  @xcite . for @xmath23u ,",
    "no measurements are available , so theoretical calculations of its @xmath1 emission must be used  @xcite .    the @xmath20 can be obtained from detailed simulations of the reactor core throughout the data taking period .",
    "the output @xmath20 must obey the thermal energy constraint @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total thermal energy produced by the reactor during the time period considered , and @xmath29 denotes the energy released per fission of isotope @xmath19 . to reduce sensitivity to errors in the simulation codes ,",
    "the codes are typically used to obtain not the @xmath20 directly but the fission fractions @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "measurements of the total generated thermal power taken regularly during reactor operation may then be used to obtain the total numbers of fissions of each isotope using equation  [ eq : powersum ] .",
    "the appropriate simulation codes are cumbersome to run , and are often proprietary , and therefore are not always available for direct use by scientific collaborations . obtaining the @xmath32 therefore requires special agreements with reactor operators . depending on the terms of the agreement , fine grained time - dependent fission fractions may be obtained .",
    "fine - grained data for @xmath28 are commonly available , since such information must be made available to nuclear regulatory bodies .",
    "reactor @xmath1 experiments then use this information to calculate the @xmath1 signal using an equation of the following form : @xmath33 where for simplicity we have assumed a single reactor , and have integrated over @xmath16 .",
    "the terms in equations  [ eq : nuebarspeccalc ] and  [ eq : reactoremissionspec ] not appearing in equation  [ eq : nuebarspeccalcmod ] have been grouped into the @xmath34 , the number of detected @xmath1 per fission of isotope @xmath19 .",
    "most recent reactor @xmath1 experiments , including kamland  @xcite , chooz  @xcite , palo verde  @xcite and bugey  @xcite , have used equation  [ eq : nuebarspeccalcmod ] , or variations on it , to perform their signal calculations . in the first two experiments , the systematic uncertainty in the signal calculation",
    "was taken to be the quadratic sum of the uncertainty in the reactor power measurements which yield @xmath28 and some estimate of the error due to the uncertainty in the fission fractions @xmath32 . in the case of palo verde",
    "this latter component was estimated from comparisons between calculated and measured isotopic concentrations in spent fuel elements  @xcite . in the case of kamland",
    "this component was taken from comparisons of a simplified reactor model to detailed simulations  @xcite , which assumes that the uncertainty of the simplified reactor model significantly exceeds that of the detailed simulations .",
    "however , no systematic uncertainty was assigned to the detailed reactor simulations . the chooz experiment  @xcite leveraged the short baseline bugey observation to limit the reaction cross section uncertainty , scaling their result to agree with the bugey - measured cross section per fission .",
    "this treatment allowed chooz to significantly reduce the error associated with the @xmath1 emission spectra ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , their method is legitimate only to the extent that the reactor simulations employed by the chooz and bugey reactor operators reliably model the different reactors with their specific fuel compositions and operation histories . in all cases ,",
    "the combined systematic error was estimated to be within 2 - 3% . at this level ,",
    "the different methods employed by each experiment are likely not overly aggressive .    with detector - based uncertainties in current and next - generation reactor",
    "@xmath1 experiments approaching the @xmath361% scale , a more careful treatment of these reactor - specific uncertainties is necessary , particularly for experiments with multiple reactor sources in which correlations become important . in this paper",
    "we outline such a detailed treatment of these uncertainties and demonstrate its application to a counting analysis of @xmath1 s from single and multiple commercial reactor sources . in section  [ power_ch ] we discuss in detail the uncertainty in reactor thermal power measurements . in section  [ compo_ch ] we examine the monte - carlo estimation of the @xmath20 and , expanding on the treatment in  @xcite and  @xcite , derive uncertainties for these based on a large body of spent fuel isotopic concentration comparisons used to verify the codes . in section  [ analysis_ch ] we combine the uncertainties from @xmath28 and the @xmath20 to estimate their contribution to the uncertainty in the anti - neutrino yield .",
    "we also discuss the applications of our calculation to specific experimental configurations , including multiple reactor sources .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "our analysis addresses issues common to large commercial power reactors , especially pressurized - water - reactors ( pwrs ) and boiling - water - reactors ( bwrs ) , using low - enrichment fuel .",
    "explanation of the operation of pwrs and bwrs may be found in  @xcite .",
    "modern neutrino experiments are almost exclusively using @xmath1 from such reactors .",
    "minor contributions from other reactor types are not considered here .",
    "all uncertainties are given at the 68.3% confidence level .",
    "the most accurate measurement of a reactor s thermal power is given by a calculation of the energy balance around the reactor vessel ( bwr ) or steam generator ( pwr ) .",
    "this requires accurate measurements of feed - water mass flow and temperature , steam enthalpy and moisture content , and reactor coolant - cycle heat gains and losses  @xcite . for the pwrs at diablo canyon power plant ( dcpp ) ( california , usa ) ,",
    "the thermal balance is written as @xmath37 @xmath38 is the core thermal output , the time - integral of which gives @xmath28 .",
    "the largest component of it , @xmath39 , is the power extracted from the steam produced directly in the steam generator .",
    "smaller corrections are represented by : @xmath40 , the power lost in the water clean - up system ; @xmath41 , the power losses to the external environment due to radiation and convection ; @xmath42 , the contribution to @xmath43 from heating of the working fluid by the circulation pumps ; and @xmath44 , the contribution to @xmath43 from heating of the working fluid by the pressurizers .",
    "the correction terms together account for 0.3 - 0.4% of the total @xmath38 .",
    "a similar thermal balance may be written for other pwrs as well as for bwrs . in the case of bwrs ,",
    "the main component is also in the form of steam produced by the reactor . for both reactor types",
    ", @xmath43 is evaluated according to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass flow rate of the feed - water to the steam generator ( pwr ) or reactor vessel ( bwr ) , and @xmath47 is the specific enthalpy rise in the steam generation .",
    "we will discuss the uncertainties in these terms below .",
    "the uncertainties on the terms other than @xmath39 in the thermal balance equation ( equation  [ eq : eq_4 ] ) contribute negligibly to the uncertainty of the core thermal power and will not be addressed further here .",
    "the enthalpy rise is calculated , using steam tables  @xcite , from inlet and outlet values of the pressure and temperature , and from the moisture content on the secondary side of the steam generator or reactor vessel .",
    "the enthalpy uncertainty has several contributions deriving from measured and calculated quantities .",
    "the errors in the temperature and pressure measurements are assumed to be random after correction for known systematic contributions .",
    "the moisture content of the steam is generally known to grow during the operation cycle because of reduced moisture removal efficiency of the steam separators due to a slow deposition of eroded metal particles .",
    "the moisture content uncertainty of the steam may be treated as a systematic uncertainty since all reactors undergo this aging process .",
    "the calculation of the enthalpy rise from these inputs using steam tables contributes an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath480.2%  @xcite .    as an example",
    ", table  [ tab : table3 ] shows the uncertainties of the quantities relevant to the enthalpy calculation for dcpp .",
    "the moisture content at dcpp s steam generators grows with time , as mentioned above ; the number in table  [ tab : table3 ] is an average over the period of operation . over longer periods",
    "the moisture content may grow , as explained above , by a factor of two over the level represented in table  [ tab : table3 ] , but even then it will comprise a sub - dominant contribution to the error budget . a similar analysis for beaver valley unit 2 yielded enthalpy - related contributions to the thermal power uncertainty totaling 0.16%  @xcite .",
    "a more general discussion in  @xcite uses an enthalpy uncertainty of 0.24% . for a generic reactor or when",
    "a more detailed analysis is unavailable , we suggest conservatively assuming 0.15% random uncertainty ( for the @xmath49 and @xmath50 measurements ) and 0.2% systematic uncertainty ( due to the moisture content and use of steam tables ) for the enthalpy rise .",
    ".[tab : table3 ] uncertainty contribution to the enthalpy from measured input quantities at dcpp .",
    "the change of the enthalpy vs given quantity , ( @xmath51enthalpy/@xmath51quantity ) , is calculated using steam tables  @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the inlet pressure , the inlet temperature , and the outlet pressure , respectively .",
    "the present moisture carryover value at dcpp is assumed in the table .",
    "the quadratic sum conservatively assumes a full 0.2% error related to the use of steam tables to calculate the enthalpy rise . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the actual situation in the japanese reactor industry is probably somewhere in between the all - venturi case and the ideal case of all ufms .",
    "many reactors may already be equipped with ufms , but some may not , and those that are may simply use them to calibrate their venturi meters . however , the total uncertainty , @xmath55 , does not change much between these two cases . thus for kamland ,",
    "a reduced error of 0.6 - 0.8% may be more appropriate .",
    "a better understanding of the nature of the japanese instrumentation and reactor simulations may result in yet smaller overall uncertainties for kamland .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimated anti - neutrino interaction rate at reactor experiments has contributions from the thermal power and the fission calculation uncertainties .",
    "the dominant contributions to the thermal power uncertainty come from the enthalpy rise and mass flow rate in the steam generator ( pwr ) or reactor vessel ( bwr ) .",
    "the former has a systematic uncertainty of 0.2% and a random uncertainty of typically 0.15% .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass flow rate depends on the instrumentation used to perform the measurement .",
    "traditional venturi flow meters exhibit significant fluctuations of 1.4% and a systematic uncertainty of 0.6% due to fouling .",
    "more precise ultrasonic flow meters have been evaluated to have systematic uncertainties below 0.5% and typically show random fluctuations below this level .",
    "we estimated , for the first time to our knowledge , the contribution to the @xmath1 signal uncertainty from errors in the fission rate calculations .",
    "these errors were extracted from comparisons of heavy element concentration measurements in spent fuel elements with calculations of those concentrations by the same simulations that reactor @xmath1 experiments rely on to obtain the fraction of fissions from each of four main heavy isotopes .",
    "error propagation accounting for correlations between the four isotopes yielded a 0.1% systematic uncertainty on the @xmath1 signal rate , and a 0.9% random uncertainty .",
    "we also estimated a 0.2% contribution due to the uncertainty in the measured energy release per fission of each isotope .",
    "we demonstrated how these errors can be combined for typical reactor experiment configurations , and highlighted situations in which cancellations occur between different reactor sites . with this methodology",
    ", we found that these contributions to the signal rate uncertainty in the kamland experiment may be reduced from 2.3% to 0.76% , or even 0.59% , pending better understanding of reactor instrumentation .",
    "as we move deeper into the phase of precision reactor neutrino oscillation experiments , and in particular multi - reactor @xmath3 experiments , such sub - percent understanding of these errors and their systematic and random components will become more and more important . as reactor engineering , flow rate metrology , and core",
    "modeling continue to improve , further reductions may be achievable in these uncertainties . toward this end , closer relationships between neutrino scientists and reactor operators should be encouraged .",
    "we are grateful to harry miley for providing some of the references used here and to palo verde nuclear generating station for providing data used in the analysis .",
    "we thank petr vogel and patrick decowski for their careful reading and useful comments .",
