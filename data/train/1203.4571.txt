    "the modeling and interpretation of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of stellar populations via stellar population synthesis ( sps ) is a fundamental tool to understand galaxy properties and their evolution .",
    "yet we are far from a complete comprehension and a reliable modeling of some stellar evolutionary phases which strongly affect the energy output of stellar populations . among them , the so - called thermally pulsing - asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb for short ) phase has been the focus of debate among modelists for several years ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maraston 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bruzual 2007 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* marigo  2008 ) ) .",
    "tp - agb stars are believed to be major contributors to the nir flux of stellar populations with age between 0.5 and 1.5 gyr",
    ". however , quantitative predictions of the lifetimes , luminosities and emission continuum shapes and spectral features of these stars and of their influence on the integrated spectra of even `` simple '' stellar populations , are still very uncertain and strongly model - dependent .",
    "different treatments of tp - agb stars ( i.e. prescriptions to model their lifetimes and luminosities , different stellar spectral libraries ) in popular sps codes can yield significant differences , in particular concerning _",
    "i ) _ the flux ratios in different nir bands and in nir vs optical bands and _ ii ) _ the presence ( or absence ) of sharp spectral features due to molecules in the atmospheres of those stars .",
    "the age and spectral ranges affected by tp - agb stars are of particular interest for two main applications . _",
    "a ) _ at low redshift , the nir is often used as tracer of stellar mass in galaxies , both unresolved ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bell  2003 ) ) and resolved ones ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * zibetti , charlot & rix , 2009 ) ) , because of the ( supposed ) lower sensitivity to the young stellar components that often dominate the visible part of the spectrum and because of lower dust extinction . however , different treatments of tp - agb stars in sps models result in systematic differences in global stellar mass estimates of several tens of percent and in substantially different estimates of the stellar mass density contrast of structures like spiral arms within galaxies ( see zibetti , charlot & rix , 2009 ) .",
    "_ b ) _ at @xmath1 , the bulk of stellar populations has mean ages in the range 0.51.5 gyr that is ( allegedly ) mostly affected by tp - agb stars . as demonstrated by , e.g. , (",
    "* maraston et al . ( 2006 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kannappan & gawiser ( 2007 ) ) , uncertainties on tp - agb models severely affect stellar mass and age determinations for galaxies at those redshifts ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conroy , gunn & white , 2009 ) ) .",
    "we directly test the impact of tp - agb stars on the integrated sed of galaxies by obtaining spectra in h and k bands , which we combine with available optical spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "such an sed can be confronted with sps predictions and used to constrain model templates for galaxies at low and high redshifts . in order to maximize the impact of tp - agb stars , we target `` post - starburst '' galaxies , whose star formation an intense burst 0.5 - 1.5 gyr back in the past , followed by negligible activity",
    ". they can be relatively easily selected from the large sdss spectral database by requiring no emission in h@xmath3 or in [ oii ] and equivalent width of h@xmath4   in absorption ( following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* goto 2005 ) ) .",
    "in addition we require light - weighted mean stellar age between 0.5 and 1.5 gyr as determined from optical spectral indexes ( little sensitive to tp - agb modeling ) according to the bayesian method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gallazzi  ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "as the most prominent nir features of tp - agb stars are located at 1.41 and 1.77@xmath5 m  and , thus , fall in the atmospheric gaps between j and h , and h and k bands for @xmath0 galaxies , we selected galaxies at @xmath60.2 , so that those two features move to the middle of the h and k atmospheric windows , respectively .",
    "the resulting sample of 16 galaxies provides a good coverage of the age - metallicity domain that is most strongly affected by tp - agb stars .",
    "nir spectra in h and k bands have been obtained with isaac at the eso - vlt during p86 and assembled with the sdss spectra to provide flux - calibrated seds ranging from @xmath73000  to @xmath721000   with a rest - frame resolution of 3  in the optical and 40   in the nir and typical s / n@xmath830 per resolution element ( see examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs9pan ] ) .",
    "spectra have been rescaled to match the broad - band `` total '' fluxes derived from sdss , ukidss and isaac imaging in matched apertures corresponding to the sdss petrosian aperture .",
    "the h- and k - band spectra of all 16 galaxies in the sample appear smooth and featureless .",
    "in particular we do not detect either of the two sharp features at 1.41@xmath5 m  and 1.77@xmath5 m  ( c@xmath9 ) rest - frame , in clear contrast with the maraston ( 2005 ) models predicting extremely strong and abrupt flux drops of 10 to 30% at those wavelengths .",
    "our observations are the first ones to prove this _ directly _ thanks to the nir spectroscopy and the choice of a suitable redshift range .",
    "nine examples out of our 16 observed galaxies are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : obs9pan ] to demonstrate the lack of such nir spectral features . spanning the full range of metallicities over the age range where tp - agb stars are expected to peak ,",
    "there is no sign of sharp nir spectral features .    over the last few years a general consensus has grown among sps modelists about the need for a boosted nir flux due to tp - agb stars with respect to earlier generation models ( e.g. bc03 ) , although with strong differences concerning its exact amount .",
    "* kriek  ( 2010 ) ) have recently challenged this , by showing that the composite ( medium - band nir ) sed of 62 post - starburst galaxies at @xmath10 is fully consistent with bc03 and inconsistent with maraston ( 2005 ) .",
    "although very careful analysis is needed to compare our new observations with different models ( in prep . ) , preliminary analysis shows that the majority of our spectra is extremely well reproduced by bc03 simple stellar populations ( ssp ) with no need for further tweaking / fitting or inclusion of dust .",
    "this suggests that predictions from early models might not require very substantial correction in terms of nir output .",
    "0.8 gyr ( top ) , to @xmath71 gyr ( middle ) to @xmath71.4 gyr ( bottom ) . in each row",
    "light - weighted mean metallicity increases from left to right , from sub - solar to super - solar values .",
    "the spectra in each panel are cross - calibrated based on sdss , ukidss and isaac photometry normalized to the flux at 0.5@xmath5m(rest ) and shown as a function of rest - frame wavelength .",
