    "gro j165540 is a well studied soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) with an orbital period of @xmath6d ( van der hooft et al.1997 , hereafter vdh ) .",
    "it contains a f35 giant or sub - giant with an effective temperature of approximately 6500k ( orosz & bailyn 1997 , hereafter ob ) .",
    "shahbaz et al .",
    "1999 ( hereafter s99 ) obtained the radial - velocity curve of the system during quiescence using high - resolution spectroscopy and found a mass function of @xmath7m@xmath5 .",
    "this value is significantly lower than the previous estimates by bailyn et al .",
    "( 1995b , @xmath8m@xmath5 ) and ob ( @xmath9m@xmath5 ) , most likely because their radial - velocity determination relied on some data that were obtained during outburst ( see phillips , shahbaz & podsiadlowski 1999 ) . from the rotational",
    "broadening of the spectral lines , they also obtained a constraint on the mass ratio of 2.293.06 .    in their original study ,",
    "ob modelled the ellipsoidal light curve during quiescence assuming a polar temperature of 6500  k for the secondary and found an inclination of @xmath10 and a mass ratio of @xmath11 .",
    "these values imply masses of @xmath12m@xmath5 and @xmath13m@xmath5 for the black hole and secondary star , respectively .",
    "vdh also modelled the ellipsoidal light curve during quiescence and obtained an inclination of @xmath14 and a secondary mass in the range of 1.603.10m@xmath5 , which implies a mass ratio of 2.433.99 .",
    "vdh s estimates have larger uncertainties since , unlike ob , they considered models with three different luminosities ( 31 , 41 and 54l@xmath5 ) taking into account uncertainties in the distance ( @xmath15kpc , obtained from the kinematics of the observed radio jet ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) and in the colour excess ( @xmath16 , based on various previous estimates ; see vdh ) . combining a value for @xmath17 of 1.3 with the observed @xmath18 colour of approximately 1.55 implies an intrinsic @xmath19 of less than 0.25 ( this is an upper limit , since any disc contribution tends to be redder than this ) .",
    "a @xmath19 of less than 0.25 corresponds to a sub - giant of spectral type a8 or earlier ( fitzgerald 1970 ) whilst the @xmath19 of a f35 giant or sub - giant is 0.390.44 .",
    "this immediately demonstrates that a value for @xmath17 of 1.3 is not consistent with the observed spectral type .",
    "an overestimate of @xmath17 leads to an overestimate of the bolometric luminosity of the secondary , which in turn requires a larger and more massive secondary .",
    "more recent estimates of the ultraviolet extinction ( hynes et al .",
    "1998 ) yielded an @xmath17 of @xmath20 .",
    "this implies a secondary of lower luminosity than considered by vdh .",
    "both ob and vdh allowed an arbitrary magnitude offset for each passband ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath21 ) when they modelled the ellipsoidal light curves .",
    "this has the same effect as allowing the distance and the colour excess to vary independently for different passbands .",
    "it also means that they were not using all the available information .",
    "in particular , this did not allow them to check whether their best - fitting models were actually consistent with the observed spectral type .",
    "in the present study we avoid these problems by fitting the ellipsoidal light curves for all passbands simultaneously ( without arbitrary offsets ) , but allowing the distance and the colour excess to vary freely . as a consequence , the distance and",
    "the colour excess are determined self - consistently from the best - fitting models instead of being taken as input parameters .",
    "in section  [ modeldescript ] we outline the basic model used in this study . in section  [ lcmodel ]",
    "we apply it to fit the quiescent light - curve data of ob for different disc structures and obtain a new model for all parameters of gro j165540 and examine their uncertainties . in section  [ sectemp ]",
    "we show how the variation in temperature across the surface of the secondary limits the accuracy to which the spectral type of the secondary can be determined .",
    "finally , in section  [ discuss ] we compare our results to previous studies and discuss the implications of our new model for the evolutionary state of the system .",
    "our method to model the ellipsoidal light curve of nova sco is similar in many respects to the methods used previously by ob and vdh .",
    "it consists of a roche - lobe filling secondary and a simple model for the accretion disc .    for a given value of the polar temperature , the temperature across the secondary",
    "is determined using a standard linear limb - darkening law , where the coefficients for each surface element are calculated by interpolating the tables of wade & rucinski ( 1985 ) .",
    "similar to ob and vdh , we model the accretion disc as a flat cylindrical disc with an opening angle of 2 . for the inner disc radius",
    "we follow ob and take , at least initially , a small value of 0.005 of the effective roche - lobe radius ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we varied the outer disc radius , which is limited by the tidal disruption radius , considering outer disc radii of 0.7 , 0.8 and 0.9 @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "for the temperature profile we adopted a simple power - law profile , @xmath23 , where we considered both a flat temperature profile with @xmath24 and a standard steady - disc profile with @xmath25 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the constant of proportionality in the temperature power - law profile depends on both the outer disc temperature and the outer disc radius . in order to make the temperature structure independent of @xmath26",
    ", we scaled the disc rim temperature to correspond to the same temperature at @xmath27 ( i.e. discs with different outer radii will all have the same temperature at @xmath28 = 0.7 @xmath22 ) .    to model the emission from the secondary and the disc ,",
    "we divide the secondary and the surface of the accretion disc into discrete elements and determine the local gravity and temperature for each element .",
    "unlike previous studies , we do not assume that the emission on the secondary is that of a blackbody ; instead we calculate it from the model atmospheres by kurucz ( 1992 ) . for this purpose",
    ", we have constructed a table , which gives the emission in different passbands ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath21 ) as a function of temperature , surface gravity and @xmath17 . to calculate the emission",
    ", we first corrected the kurucz model atmospheres for interstellar extinction for a specified value of @xmath17 using a mean galactic extinction curve ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) and calculated the extinction at each wavelength .",
    "it is important to correct for the extinction first since there is a large variation in extinction across the broadband passbands : for example in the @xmath1 band , @xmath29 varies from 3.8 to 2.1 .",
    "we then folded the extinction - corrected atmospheres through standard filter response curves ( bessell 1990 ) to obtain the emission in each passband .",
    "standard vega fluxes",
    "( t \" ug , white & lockwood 1977 ) were used to calculate the zero point corrections to the magnitudes .",
    "the emission from the disc was calculated similarly except that extinction - corrected blackbody spectra were folded through the passbands rather than model atmospheres . recently",
    "greene , bailyn & orosz ( 2001 ) have also modelled the ellipsoidal light curves using model atmosphere fluxes and their analysis is discussed further in section  [ greenecomp ] .",
    "the model atmospheres we used in this analysis were of solar abundance .",
    "the metal abundances of the secondary in gro j165540 have been measured by israelian et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who found [ fe / h]@xmath30 , but with an overabundance of @xmath31-elements compared to solar values .",
    "their @xmath31-element abundances are [ o / h]@xmath32 , [ s / h]@xmath33 , [ mg / h]@xmath34 , [ si / h]@xmath35 , [ ti / h]@xmath36 and [ n / h]@xmath37 . a solar fe abundance is supported by buxton & vennes ( 2001 ) who find [ fe / h]@xmath380.00 . as detailed @xmath31-element - enhanced model atmospheres are not freely available we are unable to use @xmath31-element - enhanced model atmospheres in our calculations . the majority of the spectral lines , however , are due to fe and so the use of the correct fe abundance is the most important factor in choosing the metallicity and reassures us that this is the correct metallicity to choose .    in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] we demonstrate how important it is to use model atmospheres rather than blackbody spectra .",
    "it shows the difference between a 6500 k blackbody and a model atmosphere of the same temperature with a gravity of 3.0 dex .",
    "this temperature corresponds to a star with a spectral type similar to gro j165540 .",
    "the spectra are significantly different , especially in the @xmath0 band region . for the @xmath21 band region ,",
    "the model atmosphere is similar to the rayleigh - jeans tail of a blackbody ; hence the blackbody assumption would be valid in this passband .",
    "orosz & hauschildt ( 2000 ) have investigated the difference between blackbodies and model atmosphere calculations and found that , with the inclusion of model atmospheres , the minima of the light curve tend to be deeper for the visible and infrared passbands , since at the minima the coolest parts of the secondary are visible ( e.g. the l1 point at phase 0.5 ) and for cool temperatures the differences between model atmospheres and blackbodies are largest .    for a particular disc model , our ellipsoidal light - curve model has five free model parameters : the mass ratio , system inclination , colour excess , distance to nova sco and polar temperature ( @xmath39 ) of the secondary star .",
    "the individual component masses ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) are calculated from the mass function , where we use the value of @xmath42m@xmath5 ( s99 ) .",
    "we determine these five free parameters by comparing our model ellipsoidal light curves to the quiescent @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 band data ( ob ) , kindly provided by j. a. orosz , using a standard chi - squared test .",
    "the quiescent data are much better sampled in the @xmath1 and @xmath21 bands than the in @xmath0 and @xmath43 bands ( there are 6 - 7 times as many data points in @xmath1 and @xmath21 compared to @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "this has the consequence of giving more weight to the @xmath1 and @xmath21 data points and hence produces a better fit in these passbands than in @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "ob tried to compensate for this by giving each point in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 passbands seven times the weight in their fitting procedure than in the other passbands .",
    "however , this gives too much weight to any outlying points the data contains as the number of @xmath44 25 points in each of these two passbands is not large enough to eliminate small number statistical effects ( e.g. the different @xmath2 magnitudes at phases 0.25 and 0.75 of the data can not be modelled properly ) .",
    "we therefore chose to give each point equal weight .",
    "a grid search was used to find the best - fitting model as this is the most reliable way of finding the global minimum . since the measurement errors are not normally distributed , it is not valid to establish quantitative relationships between @xmath45 and the confidence limits .",
    "the @xmath46 test therefore provides a merit function not a maximum likelihood estimator . because of this",
    ", the hessian matrix ( the inverse of the covariance matrix ) was not used for error estimation , but a constant @xmath45 was chosen as the boundary to define confidence regions .",
    "the parameters of the model are highly correlated with each other .",
    "for example , an increase in distance ( which makes the object fainter ) can be compensated , at least to some degree , in several different ways : ( 1 ) by a decrease in mass ratio , which increases the secondary s roche - lobe radius and hence increases its surface area ; ( 2 ) a decrease in @xmath17 , which reduces the extinction ; or ( 3 ) an increase in temperature , which makes the object more luminous .",
    "the distance to nova sco is relatively well determined from the kinematics of the radio jet ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) , and we use this as an additional constraint in the modelling , in order to obtain tighter limits on the various model parameters .",
    "the colour excess and temperature of the secondary can be used to estimate the spectral type .",
    "this allows us to check whether the best - fitting parameters are consistent with the observed spectral type of nova sco .",
    "this is preferable to the previous analyses , which allowed an arbitrary shift in the light curves , thereby losing information on the distance and extinction . shifting the light curves",
    "also has the effect of making the light - curve amplitudes strongly dependent on the proportion of disc flux .",
    "the present method avoids this problem as altering the proportion of disc flux shifts the light curves while also altering their amplitudes .",
    "therefore , an overestimate of the disk flux will be seen as a shift in the light curves toward brighter magnitudes . if the light curves were arbitrarily offset , this would only appear as a change in amplitude which could be compensated by a change in inclination , mass ratio or temperature .    the treatment of the distance and the colour excess as free parameters , and the inclusion of model atmosphere fluxes , are the only significant differences between our model and those of ob and vdh .",
    "indeed , we have checked that , using the same assumptions as ob and vdh , we obtain light - curve fits that are essentially identical to those in these respective studies .",
    "in our initial modelling we assumed a steady - state disc where the temperature profile follows a @xmath47 power law ( i.e. @xmath48 ) .",
    "this corresponds to an optically thick disc where each element emits like a blackbody ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in such a disc ,",
    "most of the contribution to the observed disc flux comes from the inner parts of the disc .",
    "we systematically varied the temperature at the disc rim , but did not find any model that produced a good fit to the observed light curves since all models produced too much blue light in the inner parts of the disc .",
    "the best fit was obtained for a cool accretion disc with a rim temperature of 1000k , which had a @xmath49 of 2.1 . however , in this model the fitted distance was much closer than the distance of @xmath50 kpc found by hjellming & rupen ( 1995 ) ; hence this model also had to be discarded .",
    "we then considered two alternative types of disc model : ( 1 ) an accretion disc with a central hole and ( 2 ) a disc with a flat temperature profile .    a central hole in the accretion disc of gro",
    "j165540 has previously been proposed by hameury et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to explain the time delay between the optical and the x - ray outbursts .",
    "models for discs with central holes have also been suggested by various authors for a variety of systems ( e.g. meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer - hofmeister & meyer 2000 ; narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ) . in these models",
    "the hole is caused by evaporation of the inner parts of the disc .",
    "here , we assumed that the temperature at the inner edge of the disc did not exceed 7000k ( a higher temperature would produce too much blue light ) .",
    "the 7000 k cutoff corresponds to @xmath51 and @xmath52 for rim temperatures of 1000 and 2000k , respectively .    in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ,",
    "maximum entropy eclipse mapping ( mem ) has been used to determine the radial temperature profile of the discs ( horne 1993 ) . in outburst ,",
    "the disc temperature profile is generally found to be consistent with a @xmath47 power law , whilst in quiescence the profile is significantly less steep , occasionally even flat ( wood et al .",
    "1986 , 1989 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the temperature profile in sxts will also be flat during quiescence ( janet wood , private communication ) . in their study , ob let the power - law index of the disc temperature profile be a free parameter and found a value of @xmath53 for their best - fitting model . based on this finding",
    ", we adopted a power - law index of @xmath54 for our model with a flat temperature profile .",
    "since for such a profile , most of the flux comes from the outer parts of the disc , this model is not sensitive to the chosen inner disc radius .    in models with a disc rim temperature of 1000k , the disc does not contribute much flux to the system .",
    "its principle effect is in eclipsing the secondary and thereby increasing the depth of the minimum at phase 0.5 .",
    "therefore , the addition of a central hole did not improve the fit .",
    "the best - fitting model for the disc with the central hole was obtained for a rim temperature of 2000k .",
    "this model has a reduced @xmath49 of 1.7 for 370 degrees of freedom .",
    "the 2000k disc contributes a greater proportion of the system s flux than the cooler 1000k disc .",
    "the disc with the flat temperature profile was modelled so that it produced the same amount of flux as the 2000k disc with the central hole ( @xmath55 per cent in @xmath1 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a rim temperature of 3500k at 0.9 @xmath22 .",
    "this model produced the overall best fit with a @xmath49 of 1.65 .    to improve the fits",
    "further , we then used a finer grid with spacings of 0.1 in the mass ratio , 0.1  in inclination , 0.001 in @xmath17 , 0.002 kpc in distance and 25 k in polar temperature for the two disc models .",
    "the results of the best fits are shown in table  [ bfvalues ] for the two types of disc models .",
    "the light - curve fits for the best - fitting model with a flat disc profile and outer disc radius of @xmath56 are shown in fig .",

    "this was done by calculating the @xmath18 for the best - fitting models when the disc flux was not included .",
    "this resulted in a decrease in @xmath18 of 0.010.02 .",
    "the @xmath17 of the best - fitting models then leads to a @xmath19 of 0.420.61 for the secondary , which corresponds to a spectral - type range of f4g0 ( fitzgerald 1970 ) .",
    "this is a somewhat later spectral type than found in previous estimates but is consistent with the analysis using quiescent data ( s99 ) .",
    "the spectral type can also be determined from the effective temperature ( @xmath62k ) .",
    "this temperature range corresponds to the spectral - type range f5g2 ( strai@xmath63ys & kuriliene 1981 ) .",
    "the two measurements are consistent with each other , implying a spectral type for the secondary of f5g0 .",
    "we note , however , that due to the highly anomalous chemical composition of the secondary ( israelian et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is not clear how well these standard relations apply .",
    "in our model we have assumed that the temperature distribution of the secondary star is described by a gravity - darkening law appropriate for a radiative atmosphere ( von zeipel 1924 ) , for which the local temperature is proportional to the local value of gravity to the 0.25 power .",
    "if the atmosphere were convective , we would expect a gravity - darkening coefficient of 0.08 ( lucy 1967 ) .",
    "the deduced spectral type of the secondary ( f5g0 ) is on the boundary between hot stars with radiative atmospheres and cool stars with convective atmospheres .",
    "if the atmosphere were convective ( with a coefficient of 0.08 ) , then the temperature variation over the surface would be smaller than in the radiative case , and the system would require a higher inclination to give the same light - curve amplitude .",
    "however , a larger inclination would produce deeper , sharper eclipses which are not observed .",
    "this suggests that the steeper gravity - darkening coefficient for radiative atmospheres is indeed the most appropriate to use .",
    "near the l1 point , the star s temperature ( @xmath64k ) is cooler than the polar temperature because of the lower surface gravity ( 2.5 vs.  3.5 dex ) .",
    "this implies that the l1 point may be convective rather than radiative .",
    "however , this would only affect the light curve near phase 0.5 , when the accretion disc is in front of the secondary .",
    "thus , any difference could be represented by a variation in the amount of eclipsing , i.e. the size of the disc . as we have considered three different disc sizes",
    ", we can be confident that this effect does not significantly add to the uncertainties .",
    "unlike the previous studies , we considered a large range of temperatures and colour excesses ( and hence luminosities ) , both of which have been consistent with the spectral type .",
    "we have , however , assumed a mean galactic extinction curve in calculating the extinction .",
    "the model is very dependent on the extinction curve as this affects the relative offsets of the light curves in different passbands .",
    "if the extinction curve were incorrect , then the fitting procedure would compensate for this by choosing different values for the distance , temperature and @xmath17 .",
    "our temperature and @xmath17 are in good agreement with the ` observed ' spectral type , which implies that the actual extinction can not significantly deviate from the mean galactic curve .",
    "the greatest variations in galactic extinction occur in the uv ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "since our fits do not rely on uv data , we suspect that deviations from the galactic mean are unlikely to be important .",
    "the alternative to using the mean galactic extinction curve would have been to shift the light curves in the modelling .",
    "however , as discussed previously , shifting the light curves arbitrarily is not desirable ( since this leads to the loss of information ) and so using the mean galactic extinction curve is preferable , especially as the modelling proves to be fully self - consistent .",
    "our disc model is rather simple .",
    "for example , we assumed a flat cylindrical disc ; this is unrealistic as the disc will almost certainly be more complicated with well defined structure .",
    "possible evidence of structure can be seen in the @xmath21 band data near phase 0.85 where there is a systematic offset between the data points and the light curve .",
    "the data points are dimmer with flux variations of up to 2.5 per cent .",
    "even though the disc in our model contributes only a small fraction of the total flux ( @xmath65per cent in @xmath1 ) , the model is sensitive to its contribution ( as can be seen from the comparison of the best - fitting models for different disc structures in tables  [ bfhole ] and [ bfflat ] ) . in our modelling , we varied the size , temperature and power - law index of the disc .",
    "the size of the disc determines the depth of the grazing eclipse and hence the inclination .",
    "since we varied these key disc parameters over a wide range of plausible values , we expect our estimates of the model parameters ( e.g. the inclination and the component masses ) and their uncertainties to be reasonably realistic .",
    "the proportion of flux , the cool accretion discs in our models contribute to the total flux , increases with wavelength i.e. the minimum contamination is in @xmath0 .",
    "this is different from models for the sxt a062000 ( v616 mon ) where the disc contribution appears to decrease from @xmath66 per cent in @xmath1 ( oke 1977 ; mcclintock & remillard 1986 ) to less than 27 per cent in the infrared ( shahbaz , bandyopadhyay & charles 1999 ) .",
    "this shows that even in a062000 , which has a much shorter orbital period ( 7.75 hr ; mcclintock & remillard 1986 ) and has been in quiescence for much longer , the disc contributes appreciably to the total flux of the system .    on the other hand , greene et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have justified the use of a model without a disc by claiming that an accretion - disc model does not fit the data well and that the flux contribution from it will be negligible . the disc model they consider",
    ", however , contributes a large proportion of the @xmath67 flux , as evidenced by the eclipses in their accretion - disc model at phase 0.0 as opposed to phase 0.5 for eclipses of the secondary .",
    "a model with a smaller proportion of @xmath67 flux would have a larger amplitude than their accretion - disc model .",
    "this would better fit the data , decreasing the requirement for a model without an accretion disc .",
    "in the next section we will show that models without an accretion disc affect other model parameters , in particular the inferred distance , and that no fully self - consistent models can be obtained without a disc .",
    "our model can also be used to make predictions for other passbands . using our best - fitting models , we calculated the expected @xmath68 and @xmath67 band light curves . for the @xmath68 and @xmath67 bands",
    "we find mean magnitudes of 13.8 and 13.0 , respectively , with the disc contributing between 10 and 20 per cent of the total flux depending on the model .",
    "greene et al .  (",
    "2001 ) have recently presented @xmath69 photometry of gro j165540 in quiescence .",
    "they find mean @xmath68 and @xmath67 magnitudes of 13.85 and 13.25 , respectively .",
    "our @xmath68 band prediction is in good agreement with their photometry apart from the depth of the minima , which is somewhat too low ( possibly because the inclination is slightly too low ) .",
    "however , the general agreement in the @xmath68 band provides some direct confirmation that the luminosity and colour excess found in our modelling are accurate .",
    "the amplitude of our @xmath67 band light curve is also in good agreement with their photometry .",
    "we find a slightly larger amplitude than their best - fitting model but entirely consistent with their data .",
    "the reason for the @xmath70 band mean magnitude discrepancy is not clear , although we have only calculated the best - fitting models and so do not know what range of @xmath67 magnitudes is represented by our range of parameters .",
    "johnson ( 1966 ) provides intrinsic infrared colours for luminosity classes iii and v. we may compare these to the colour implied by the photometry of greene et al .",
    "their @xmath71 colour is 0.6 . assuming the standard @xmath68 and @xmath67 extinction coefficients of fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) , i.e. @xmath72 , and our @xmath17 of @xmath73",
    ", we obtain a @xmath74 of @xmath75",
    ". for luminosity class iii , johnson ( 1966 ) only lists the infrared colours for spectral type g5 and later . for luminosity class",
    "v , johnson ( 1966 ) gives @xmath74 colours of 0.28 and 0.32 for spectral type f5 and g0 , respectively ",
    "a @xmath74 colour of 0.1 would correspond to an a star .",
    "the @xmath74 colour appropriate for a f5 or g0 star would require a @xmath71 of 0.8 , similar to the value in our model . hence there appears to be a deficit of @xmath67 flux in the system , the cause of which is not clear .",
    "we can easily check whether a similar discrepancy exists in the modelling of greene et al .",

    "this variation would be large enough to change the observed spectral sub - type with phase if there was not such a large range of temperatures across the observable part of the secondary at each phase .",

    "this range corresponds to stars of spectral sub - type f5g5 ( strai@xmath63ys & kuriliene 1981 ) .",
    "the effect this variation in temperature has on the observed line profiles is unknown and is worth further investigation .",

    "vdh found that , for a steady - state disc , there were no reasonable solutions with rim temperatures greater than 1000k .",
    "this is consistent with our results as the models with a 2000k disc do not provide good fits to the data unless the inner disc is removed .",
    "ob allowed the power - law exponent for the temperature profile , the rim temperature and the size of the disc to be free parameters .",
    "they obtained a best - fitting power - law exponent of @xmath87 , a rim temperature of @xmath88k and an outer disc radius of @xmath89 . with an exponent of @xmath54 ,",
    "we fit the data with a disc rim temperature of 3500k at @xmath90 , which at the radius @xmath89 has a temperature of 3580k .",
    "hence the disc in this model is 750k cooler than that found by ob .",
    "the accretion disc model with a central hole contributes predominantly red light as it has a low average temperature , similar to the disc with the flat temperature profile .",
    "hence we can conclude that the disc in gro j165540 , when it is in quiescence , is predominantly red and cool .",
    "although the flatter temperature profile is preferred in the modelling , the actual disc will almost certainly be more complicated .",
    "ob only considered one accretion disc structure in their model , although their accretion - disc parameters were free to vary .",
    "our analysis shows that the system parameters vary with the accretion - disc model .",
    "hence , a range of accretion - disc models need to be considered in order to avoid underestimating the systematic errors . relying on the minimization of @xmath46",
    "is insufficient as the modelling is not sufficiently accurate to enable a reliable determination of the precise accretion - disc structure .",
    "this is because , as mentioned earlier , the actual accretion - disc will be more complicated than the simple model assumed in these analyses .",
    "indeed , from our analysis , it is clear that a large range of mass ratios and hence masses will fit the light - curve amplitudes .",
    "these amplitudes are strongly dependent on the accretion - disc model and the proportion of flux for each model in each band .",
    "gro j165540 has a secondary of earlier spectral type and hence higher luminosity than most other sxts .",
    "this means that accretion - disc contamination is less important than in other systems , although it still strongly affects the inferred system paramaters .",
    "we therefore used the independent distance determination from the kinematics of the radio jet ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) , as used previously to model the jets in ss433 ( hjellming & johnston 1988 ) to further constrain the allowed disc models .",
    "there are , however , a number of possible systematic errors in this measurement .",
    "the inclination of the jet axis of @xmath91 is significantly different from the system inclination of @xmath92 , implying a more complicated geometry than the simple model they use .",
    "this model also does not describe all the structure observed in the jet , and there are deviations from simple linear expansion which they assume .",
    "in addition there is motion over the length of an observation which would result in smearing . on the other hand , they chose a beam - width larger than the proper motion during each six - hour vlba observation to minimize this effect .",
    "these observations did not have absolute positional information resulting in the central source being used for reference .",
    "this is undesirable as it makes the alignment of the different images in their analysis a free parameter .",
    "if this distance measurement were incorrect , this could somewhat alter our best - fitting parameters .",
    "distance estimates by other authors are , however , consistent with their determination : @xmath93kpc ( bailyn et al .",

    "1995 ) . hence , using their distance determination of @xmath97kpc as additional constraint is reasonable .    a lower value for the colour excess than used previously is needed to provide good fits to the data in all passbands simultaneously .",

    "this @xmath17 along with the effective temperature implies a spectral type range for the secondary of f5g0 , consistent with previous estimates ( s99 ) .",
    "vdh used a value for the colour excess of 1.3 in their study and hence had to assume a significantly larger luminosity of the secondary ( 3154l@xmath5 as compared to @xmath100l@xmath5 found here ) .",

    "a lower luminosity , which alters gro j165540 s position in the hr diagram , along with the lower masses implied by our model has implications for the interpretation of the system s evolutionary state ( see section  [ evolsec ] ) .",

    "a larger mass ratio implies a smaller and hence less luminous secondary , as required by our lower value for the colour excess .",
    "s99 found a mass ratio of 2.293.06 ( 95 per cent confidence ) based on their estimate of the rotational broadening of the spectral lines .",
    "they assumed that the secondary was spherical and that all the observed broadening was a consequence of rotation . fitting a broadening profile to template star spectra and minimizing the residuals",
    ", they found a rotational velocity , @xmath105 , of 82.994.9kms@xmath106 .",
    "our mass ratio range corresponds to a @xmath105 of 68.379.1kms@xmath106 , using their broadening to mass ratio relation . in their determination of the average spectrum ,",
    "s99 did not correct for the orbital smearing of the spectra due to the length of the exposure time of the observations .",
    "most of their spectra were taken near the quadrature phases when orbital smearing would be at its greatest .",
    "this results in the apparent broadening of the lines by 7kms@xmath106 ( at the orbital phase when the spectra were taken ) .",
    "since this broadening should be added linearly to the rotational broadening ( rather than in quadrature ) , it introduces an additional , but spurious rotational broadening of 3.5kms@xmath106 ( about half of the change of the radial velocity during the observations ) .",
    "s99 took the radius of a spherical star in their model to be the effective roche - lobe radius . in reality",
    ", a roche - lobe filling object can be described by an ellipsoid to first approximation .",
    "this implies that the light contributing to a spectral line will come from a larger range of radii ( and hence velocities ) than for a spherical star of the same volume and that the assumption of sphericity will lead to an overestimate of the rotational velocity .",
    "the dependence of @xmath105 on the mass ratio for a realistic model containing a roche - lobe filling star is consequently non - trivial and requires detailed modelling .",
    "orosz & hauschildt ( 2000 ) have investigated the difference in rotational broadening kernels between roche - lobe filling models and analytical models .",
    "they found that , for a roche - lobe filling star , the broadening kernel changes with phase and is significantly different near the quadrature phases where it is wider and asymmetric .",
    "the calculation using the analytical kernel then provides an upper limit to @xmath105 .",
    "since an upper limit on the rotational broadening provides a lower limit to the mass ratio , we conclude that our estimates are likely to be consistent with the findings of s99 , once all of these effects are properly taken into account .",

    ", they predict a @xmath105 of 28.6kms@xmath106 .",

    "modelling the binary evolution of gro j165540 with a present secondary mass of 2.35m@xmath5 ( ob ) leads to an average ( secular ) mass - transfer rate that tend to be much larger than is consistent with its x - ray transient behaviour ( van paradijs 1996 ; king , kolb & szuskiewicz 1997 ) .",
    "kolb et al .  ( 1997 ) and kolb ( 1998 ) showed that this problem could be solved if the secondary were in a special position in the hertzsprung gap ; this , however , required a somewhat cooler secondary than is consistent with its spectral type .",
    "regs , tout & wickramasinghe ( 1998 ) suggested as an alternative solution that the secondary is still on the main sequence .",
    "this also requires some fine - tuning and significant convective overshooting ( but is consistent with recent findings ; pols et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the lower mass found in this re - analysis largely removes this problem , irrespective of whether the secondary is still on the main sequence or in the hertzsprung gap . to illustrate this we present a case a binary calculation ( similar to the model of regs et al .",

    "the mass - transfer rate is well below the critical rate until the end of the main sequence .",
    "we have also performed some early case b binary calculations ( i.e. where the secondary has just evolved off the main sequence ) and also find that , with the lower mass of the secondary , the present mass - transfer rate is below the critical rate for transient behaviour , although case b models generally do not fit as well as late case a models .    in our case a model , the initial masses , i.e. immediately after the supernova in which the black hole was formed , were 4.1 and 2.5m@xmath5 for the black hole and secondary , respectively .",
    "these masses are very similar to the post - supernova masses required to explain the pollution of the secondary with @xmath31-process material ( israelian et al .",

    "a complete picture starts to emerge for the evolutionary history of nova sco .",
    "the pollution of the secondary with supernova material proves that the black hole formed in a supernova ( or a hypernova ) .",
    "some material that was produced in the supernova had to be captured by the secondary ; this requires both fallback of material and mixing in the supernova ejecta ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2001b ) . in a typical model , the orbital period after the binary has re - circularized after the supernova is about 20hr ( see the mixing models in table  3 of podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2001b ) , very close to the period needed for a late case a scenario as shown in fig .  [ evol ] .",
    "since then the secondary has transferred some 1m@xmath5 , increasing the orbital period to its present value .",
    "self - consistent models also require that the black hole received a significant kick at birth in order to produce the high observed system space velocity , consistent with the fallback suggestion by brandt , podsiadlowski & sigurdsson ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have obtained self - consistent fits to the ellipsoidal light curves of gro j165540 for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath21 passbands simultaneously without making _ a priori _ assumptions about the distance and the colour excess . using the distance estimate of @xmath97kpc , based on the kinematics of the radio jet , as additional constraint",

    "this is consistent with the spectral type found by s99 .",
    "our mass ratio , larger than found previously , of @xmath104 , along with our inclination of 6865@xmath114 implies lower masses of @xmath115m@xmath5 and @xmath116m@xmath5 for the black hole and the companion , respectively . the mass ratio along with the @xmath17 also implies a lower luminosity of the secondary of @xmath100l@xmath5 .",
    "these results are , however , rather sensitive to the assumptions about the disc structure ( even though in @xmath1 the disc only contributes some 5 per cent of the light ) .",
    "our best - fitting models have a disc temperature profile that is much flatter than that of a steady - state disc .",
