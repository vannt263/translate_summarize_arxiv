    "this plot assumes that if one or more cores form , at least one will result in a gas giant . for comparison to current observations",
    ", it also assumes that as they accrete gas , cores generally migrate or scatter a stellar - mass independent fraction to observable distances , where the 6% normalisation applies . like our baseline model , different @xmath95 , @xmath103 , and @xmath66 have lines of approximately constant slope ( @xmath147 ) up to @xmath23@xmath0 .",
    "our baseline model has @xmath148 and @xmath149 ; very few gas giants form by core accretion below 0.3@xmath0 .    with the normalisation ,",
    "our baseline model predicts 1% of 0.4@xmath0 stars , and 10% of 1.5@xmath0 stars will harbour at least one gas giant .",
    "increasing @xmath150 decreases the range of probabilities , because disk masses come from a less strongly varying section of the overall distribution .",
    "for example , @xmath151 yields 4% and 8% for 0.4@xmath0 and 1.5@xmath0 stars respectively .    our result is robust to changes in our assumed model parameters ( in the range 0.41.5@xmath0 ) , because the range of core forming disk masses generally remains the same , and the 6% normalisation removes absolute differences for different model parameters .    despite its simplicity ,",
    "our model modified to have a constant snow line at @xmath152au produces a similar result to @xcite : that less gas giants form above a solar mass .",
    "the difference arises from the stronger dependence of snow line distance with stellar mass . for stars @xmath53@xmath0 in our model ,",

    "these effects have the potential to increase the frequency of giant planets as stellar mass increases .",
    "we describe a model for the evolution of the snow line in a planet forming disk , and apply it over a range of stellar masses to derive the probability distribution of gas giants as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the two main ingredients for our model are a prescription for movement of the snow line due to accretion and pms evolution , and rules that determine whether protoplanets are massive enough , and form early enough , to become gas giants .",

    "the transition is at a few myr for @xmath22@xmath0 stars . over the wide range of",
    "observed accretion rates for any fixed stellar mass , the snow line in some disks may be set entirely by irradiation .",
    "the snow line generally sets where the innermost gas giant cores form . in relatively massive disks around intermediate mass stars ,",
    "rocky cores form interior to the snow line .",
    "the location of the outermost core is always set by the gas dissipation timescale .",
    "the range of disk masses that form cores , and the radial width of the region in the disk where they form , increase with stellar mass .",
    "lower mass disks produce failed icy cores , which are probably similar to uranus , neptune , and the observed `` super - earths . ''",
    "the outward movement of the snow line as stars more massive than the sun reach the main - sequence , and as the disk becomes optically thin , allows the ocean planets suggested by @xcite to form _ in situ_. the change in disk temperature is only large enough for these planets to harbour oceans around stars @xmath12.5@xmath0 .",
    "our model includes several poorly determined parameters , which current and future facilities will investigate . while there are current resolved studies of gaseous disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the next generation of telescopes such as gmt and alma will provide more information on surface density profiles , and how disk properties change with stellar mass and age .",

    "we have shown that the time dependence of the snow line in part determines where gas giant cores form .",
    "this result should motivate future studies of planet formation in disks whose properties change with time .",
    "the subsequent evolution of isolated cores is beyond the scope of this paper , but further work that investigates the growth and dynamical evolution of these objects can investigate the diversity of resulting system structures .    given an initial distribution of disk masses , the probability that a star has at least one gas giant increases linearly with stellar mass from 0.4@xmath0 to 3@xmath0 .",
    "if the frequency of gas giants around solar - mass stars is 6% , we predict an occurrence rate of 1% ( 10% ) for 0.4@xmath0 ( 1.5@xmath0 ) stars .",
    "this result is largely insensitive to changes in our model parameters .",
    "in contrast to the @xcite model , where it is hard to form observable gas giants above 1@xmath0 , our model predicts a peak at @xmath23@xmath0 because we include disk and pms evolution in our snow line derivation . however , our model does not include migration , so our prediction applies to observable and currently undetectable gas giants .",
