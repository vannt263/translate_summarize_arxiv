    "a general feature of gauge theories on non - commutative ( nc ) space - time is the appearance of many new interactions which can lead to standard model ( sm ) forbidden processes . in this paper",
    "we use the non - commutative standard model ( ncsm ) to estimate decay of heavy quarkonia ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , i.e. quarkonia annihilation into two photons , which is strictly forbidden in the sm by angular momentum conservation and bose statistics , known as landau - pomeranchuk - yang ( lpy ) theorem .",
    "since the violation of the lpy theorem represents in fact the violation of lorentz invariance , which is intrinsically embedded in non - commutative theories , such decays can in principle serve as an signature of space - time non - commutativity .",
    "this proposal represents an attempt to obtain the bound on the nc scale @xmath5 from hadronic physics .",
    "a method for implementing non - abelian @xmath6 yang - mills theories on non - commutative space - time was proposed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this method was applied to the full sm of particle physics resulting in a minimal non - commutative extension of the sm with the same structure group @xmath7 and with the same fields and number of coupling parameters as in the original sm .",
    "it is the only known approach that allows to build models of the electroweak sector directly based on the structure group @xmath8 in a non - commutative background .",
    "we call this model ncsm and it represents an effective , anomaly free @xcite , non - commutative field theory .",
    "space - time non - commutativity can be parameterized by the constant antisymmetric matrix @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the product of non - commutative structure , while @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being dimensionless coefficients presumably of order unity .",
    "violation of lorentz symmetry is introduced by virtue of nonzero @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of discrete symmetry properties of the ncsm @xcite shows that @xmath15 transforms under c , p , t in such a way that it preserves these symmetries in the action .",
    "however , considering @xmath15 as a fixed spectator field , there will be spontaneous breaking of c , p and/or cp ( relative to the spectator ) . in the process of interest",
    "the c symmetry is violated .",
    "an alternative proposal for the construction of non - commutative generalizations of the standard model has been put forward in @xcite .",
    "signatures of non - commutativity have been discussed from the point of view of collider physics  @xcite , including sm forbidden @xmath16 decays @xcite , neutrino astrophysics @xcite and neutrino physics @xcite , as well as low - energy non - accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "note that the lorentz violating operators considered in @xcite and @xcite do not appear in the ncsm @xcite considered in this article .",
    "furthermore , the rather high bound on non - commutativity obtained in @xcite is based on a particular operator contribution appearing in nc qcd that , as discussed in @xcite , is canceled by the contribution of other terms in this model . in the ncsm",
    "@xcite the existing bound of @xmath17 comes from a rather crude model estimate obtained in @xcite .",
    "finally , research of bound state decays in the framework of noncommutative qed / qcd @xcite were performed by computating the lifetimes of ortho and para positronium @xcite as well as the corrections to gluonic decays of heavy quarkonia @xcite . for reviews ,",
    ".    experimental discovery of the kinematically allowed decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as well as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , would certainly prove a violation of the lpy theorem and could serve as a possible indication / signal for space - time non - commutativity .",
    "in section 2 we briefly review the ingredients of the ncsm relevant to this work . in section 3 the amplitudes for the @xmath22 process",
    "are worked out , while in section 4 the decay rates are determined .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion of numerical results and concluding remarks .",
    "the general action of the ncsm is @xmath23 where for explicit expressions of particular contributions we refer to @xcite .    for the simple case of quark qed interactions , which is relevant to sm forbidden decays of quarkonia into two photons , the expansion up to the first order in the nc parameter @xmath15 reads @xmath24 \\ , , \\label{eq : hatpsidpsim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the photon field strength tensor . the kinetic part in ( [ eq : hatpsidpsim ] ) comes from @xmath27 , while the mass contribution originates from @xmath28 which , in the case of qed , interactions takes this simple form @xcite",
    "at the order @xmath15 , the electroweak interactions have additional , much more involved mass contributions , but only the sm electroweak quark interactions are relevant to our calculation .    in the gauge sector of the action ( [ eq : sncsm ] ) , we have freedom in the choice of traces in kinetic terms for gauge fields .",
    "two different choices were under consideration in @xcite producing two different actions in the gauge sector , corresponding to the so - called minimal ( mncsm ) and the non - minimal ( nmncsm ) model , respectively .",
    "the matter sector of the action is not affected by the change of the gauge part ; the quark - gauge boson interactions remain the same in both models .",
    "the mncsm adopts the following choice for the traces in @xmath29 : a sum of three traces over the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 sectors with @xmath33 in the definition of @xmath34 and the fundamental representation for @xmath31 and @xmath32 generators in @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . up to the first order in the @xmath15 expansion ,",
    "the following gauge terms in the mncsm are obtained : @xmath37 \\;. \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 field strengths , respectively . at order @xmath15",
    "there are no corrections nor new interactions involving electroweak fields .",
    "one can pick up the other representation of the gauge sector , such that the trace is chosen over all particle multiplets on which covariant derivatives act and which have different quantum numbers . in the sm , these are five multiplets for each generation of fermions and one higgs multiplet .",
    "new triple neutral gauge boson interactions , usually forbidden by lorentz invariance , angular moment conservation and the lpy theorem , arise quite naturally in the framework of nmncsm model @xcite .    in the case of quarkonia",
    "decays into two photons , the gauge sector in the nmncsm gives important contributions through the appearances of novel triple gauge boson @xmath41 and @xmath42 couplings .",

    "parameters in the nmncsm can be restricted by considering guts on non - commutative space - time @xcite .",
    "in our model , for computations of relevant matrix elements , i.e. for computations of the diagrams from figures [ f:1 ] and [ f:2 ] , we employ feynman rules derived in @xcite",
    ". a helpful property of the action , important for check of calculations , is its symmetry under ordinary gauge transformations in addition to non - commutative ones .",
    "furthermore , in the computations of the diagrams from figures [ f:1 ] and [ f:2 ] , applying the following prescription for quarkonia to the vacuum transition matrix element of the operator @xmath47 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 are color indices ) @xmath50^{\\alpha\\beta } \\ , \\delta_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we actually hadronize free quarks into a quarkonium bound state and calculate the amplitude for the quarkonia decay into two photons . here",

    "]    while only the quark exchange diagrams from figure [ f:1 ] contribute to the mncsm amplitude @xmath66 , the nmncsm amplitude for the quarkonia decay into two photons amounts to the sum of contributions from the diagrams in figures [ f:1 ] and [ f:2 ] , @xmath67 .    at the end of this section ,",
    "note that the ncsm free quark amplitude obtained from the sum of diagrams in figure [ f:1 ] is invariant under the electromagnetic gauge transformation , as it should be .",
    "each of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 exchange diagrams from figure [ f:2 ] is also electromagnetically gauge invariant , as expected .",

    "it corresponds to setting @xmath73 in ( [ pdw ] ) .    in the above computations we have used the following identities : @xmath74    to maximize the rates ( [ pdw ] ) we can assume that the dimensionless quantities @xmath75 and @xmath76 are of order one .",
    "matrix elements used here is taken from @xcite . ] normalizing the obtained decay rate to the decay of @xmath77 into lepton pairs , by using ( [ wfo ] ) we find @xmath78 ^ 2 \\ , .",
    "\\label{pdwr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , in the case of mncsm couplings , we obtain the following ratios for @xmath79 and @xmath80 decays : @xmath81 and @xmath82 note here that choosing @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as it is favored by the string theory , would produce result ( [ pdwr ] ) multiplied by 3/10 , which does not change the final conclusion in a serious way .",
    "the range of the scale of non - commutativity , @xmath85 , was choosen because it produces experimentally reachable quarkonia decay to two photons rates .",
    "since the rate ( [ pdwr ] ) depends on @xmath86 it is quite clear that any larger @xmath5 would dramatically decrease possibility to see the signal for the non - commutativity of space - time via quarkonia to two photons decay at present and near - future experiments .    the choosen range of the scale of non - commutativity then gives @xmath87 and @xmath88    from the experiment one has @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite , which then leads to @xmath91    for the @xmath80 case , @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite , which , with @xmath5 in the above range , gives the following range for the @xmath80 branching ratio : @xmath94    for the nmncsm , with the choice of the triple gauge boson couplings @xmath95 and @xmath96 the rates for the @xmath97 and @xmath98 decays reach maximal values . in the same range of the scale of non - commutativity as above , @xmath99",
    ", we then have @xmath100 and @xmath101 using the aforementioned experimental values for @xmath4 and @xmath80 we obtain the following ranges for relevant branching ratios : @xmath102",
    "as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 coupling constants , at the scale of non - commutativity @xmath103 tev . the horizontal plane at the value of @xmath104 indicates the @xmath105 , which one obtains by setting @xmath106 in ( ) . ]     as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 coupling constants , at the scale of non - commutativity @xmath103 tev .",
    "the horizontal plane at the value of @xmath107 indicates the @xmath108 , which one obtains by setting @xmath106 in ( ) . ]      theoretically , in the @xmath4 case , the addition of triple neutral gauge boson couplings via a photon and a z - boson exchange diagram in figure [ f:2 ] , contributes to the nmncsm amplitude both constructively and destructively , depending on the specific values of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 coupling constants from the area in figure [ f:3 ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the branching ratio for the @xmath2 decay increases or decreases with respect to the values obtained in the mncsm .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ f:4 ] which shows the branching ratio @xmath110 as a function of the triple neutral gauge boson constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "since the constructive  destructive contributions are spread approximatively equally within the allowed range of the @xmath44 , @xmath45 constants , we conclude that additional uncertainty in the prediction of the @xmath111 branching ratio , due to the ncsm model building , makes the @xmath111 decay a less favorite candidate for distinguishing the mncsm from the nmncsm .",
    "however , for the @xmath80 decay , because of the positive charm quark charge , the addition of the photon and z - boson exchange diagrams ( figure [ f:2 ] ) to the quark exchange diagrams in figure [ f:1 ] contributes constructively to the dominant part of the @xmath112 area , producing rates larger by a factor of @xmath113 with respect to those gained in the mncsm .",
    "destructive contributions are small , covering about a few % of the @xmath112 area .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ f:5 ] showing that the nmncsm contributions to the @xmath114 decay are almost always constructive , thus effectively enhancing its branching ratio .",
    "experimentally @xcite , concerning the @xmath115 decay , at cleo - iii there is the largest sample of @xmath115 resonances produced in @xmath116 collisions , about 21 million .",
    "however , it will be very difficult to observe the @xmath117 decay because of the larger qed background from the non - resonant @xmath118 process .",
    "the resonant cross - section for @xmath119 is of the same order of magnitude as the background cross - section .",
    "thus it seems that the detection of @xmath120 below @xmath121 will be hopeless with the present data .",
    "considering the @xmath98 decay , there are much better chances since the resonant cross - section is much higher .",
    "the existing limit , which comes from a very old experiment @xmath122 @xcite , can be improved but probably the nc limits given in ( [ mbr2 ] ) and ( [ nmbr2 ] ) are unreachable today .",
    "unfortunately , the above experimental limits are too weak to set any reliable bound on the non - commutative scale from our model estimate .",
    "finally , note that quarkonia and the z - boson to two photon decay processes are related in the nmncsm , via the @xmath42 interaction @xcite of the strength @xmath123 determined in @xcite .",
    "we have found that the @xmath46 decay rates become maximal for the values @xmath95 and @xmath124 .",
    "the same value @xmath124 , produces the minimal value of @xmath125 via eq .",
    "( 17 ) from @xcite and table 1 from @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the value of @xmath126 , for any @xmath127 ( see table 1 in @xcite ) , maximizes the @xmath128 decay rate and , at the same time , minimizes the @xmath46 branching ratios ( see figures [ f:4 ] and [ f:5 ] ) .",
    "the combination of all three decays would certainly narrow the parameter space of unknown constants of our model , like @xmath129 , @xmath45 , etc .    in conclusion , if the future experiments measure any of the @xmath128 , @xmath114 and @xmath111 branching ratios , the appearances of the physics beyond the sm would then be strongly indicated .",
    "we hope that the importance of a possible discovery of space - time non - commutativity will convince experimentalists to look for sm forbidden decays in hadronic physics .",
