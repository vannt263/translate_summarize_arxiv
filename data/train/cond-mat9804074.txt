    "the mechanism of the photon localization _ via _ the resonant coupling between photons and the local excitations inside the polariton gap was for the first time proposed in refs.@xcite . considering a dipole - active impurity atom in an isotropic frequency - dispersive medium",
    ", the authors discovered the photon - atom bound states .",
    "they showed that when the atom transition frequencies fall inside the polariton gap , the radiative relaxation of the bound states is suppressed , and the field is localized around the impurity .    in the recent papers @xcite",
    ", we considered another type of the impurity - induced polariton states associated with the phonon _  _ local states in polar crystals .",
    "it was shown that near the bottom of the polariton gap , the local states are predominated by the long - wavelength modes and have the macroscopic localization and coherence radiuses .",
    "we attributed these features to the singularity of the density of states at the gap bottom , which also causes the absence of the lower threshold for the impurity strength .",
    "the singularity is provided by the long - wavelength polaritons and is generic for any isotropic dipole - active phonon mode with the negative dispersion .",
    "the long - wavelength nature of the polariton states allowed us to analyze the crossover between the polariton and phonon local states within the continuum approximation .",
    "our results show that the crossover takes place in a relativistically narrow interval near the bottom of the polariton gap @xcite . a small width of the crossover region and a strong suppression of the photon content of the polariton local states are caused by the fact that the typical momentum of the modes dominating in these states",
    ", @xmath3 is much greater than the cross - resonance momentum , @xmath4 where @xmath2 is the lattice parameter , and @xmath5is the ratio between the phonon velocity and the speed of light . to eliminate this disproportion , one needs to lower the group velocity of electromagnetic waves in the active medium .",
    "it can be achieved if the medium is placed inside a waveguide .",
    "for instance , in the parallel - plate waveguide , the dispersion law of the propagating modes , @xmath6 provides the reduction of their group velocity in the long - wavelength region .",
    "the phonon and photon velocities become comparable in the cross - resonance region if the spacing between plates , @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "however , as long as the waveguide spectrum contains the activationless mode @xmath8 , there is a guarantee that @xmath9 is far away from the cross - resonance point .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the polarization waves in an atomically thin dielectric layer ( ionic 2d - crystal ) placed in a narrow parallel - plate waveguide .",
    "the srtuctural stability of 2d - crystal is provided by a strong confining potential , which also eliminates the activationless mode from the waveguide spectrum .",
    "a sub - micron crystal film grown on a substrate can be a physical realization of this model .",
    "the coherent interaction between the waveguide modes and the polarization waves gives rise to new exitations - 2d - polaritons .",
    "they form two polariton bands , and the position of the maximum in the lower polariton branch depends on the waveguide width .",
    "we show that @xmath10  for @xmath11 and @xmath9 tends to @xmath12 when@xmath13 .  in the latter case ,",
    "the frequency region of the polariton local states is enlarged by the factor of @xmath14 comparing to the 3d - case",
    ". the electric field in these states is always delocalized across the 2d - crystal within the distance of the order of @xmath15 from the defect due to the contribution from the upper polariton band . upon increase of the impurity strength ,",
    "the localization length decreases and contributions to the field from the lower and upper branches begin to compete everywhere in the waveguide .",
    "when the localization length becomes comparable with the waveguide width , the field is no longer confined near the dielectric layer and the polariton local state transforms into the localized waveguide mode .",
    "we estimate the corresponding value of the impurity strength , and@xmath16 show that , in the waveguide with @xmath17 the localized mode can be provided by a single impurity or a structural defect .",
    "let us consider an atomically thin dielectric layer between two perfectly conducting sheets [ fig.1 ] .",
    "the layer presents a regular ionic 2d - crystal , which is stabilized in @xmath18 plane by a strong restraining potential .",
    "this increases the activation energy of the off - layer lattice vibrations and shifts the corresponding phonon modes much higher than the modes with the in - plane polarization . assuming an infinitely strong confining potential we eliminate the off - plane phonons from our model . among the remaining in - plane phonons , for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider only a single transverse dipole - active mode with the isotropic spectrum and negative dispersion . in the long - wavelength region",
    ", we can use the standard approximation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 sets the range of the typical phonon velocities .",
    "the dipole - active excitations in a thin layer have a high decay rate , unless induced electromagnetic radiation from the layer is compensated . in our model",
    "it is provided by the coherent coupling between the lattice excitations and the eigen modes of the waveguide . in the parallel plate waveguide , there are two types of propagating modes [ fig.1 ] .",
    "tm - modes ( transverse - magnetic ) involve electric field directed across the dielectric layer and , therefore , they can not be activated in our model . electric field in te - modes ( transverse - electric ) is directed along the layer and , therefore , these modes can be excited along with the the transverse - optical phonons . introducing the surface polarization @xmath21 associated with these 2d - phonons and considering its dynamics together with the corresponding te - modes of the waveguide , we obtain the following system of equations : @xmath22    @xmath23\\,{q\\,}\\!_{{\\bf k}}=-\\frac{ad^{2}}{4\\pi   } \\!{e}_{{\\bf k}}{\\bf ( } 0{\\bf ) } ,   \\label{2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the 2d - fourier amplitudes of the polarization and electric fields , @xmath26 is a 2d - wave vector , @xmath27 is the phonon - photon coupling parameter ( ion plasma frequency ) . for",
