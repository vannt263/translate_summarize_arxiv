    "we study a reaction - diffusion equation with a nonlocal reaction term : @xmath0 this problem , introduced by bnichou , calvez , meunier , and voituriez @xcite , models a population structured by a space variable @xmath1 and a motility trait @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis is focused on the case where the trait space @xmath3 is a bounded subset of @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive and represent , respectively , the rate of mutation and the net reproduction rate in the absence of competition .",
    "the problem ( [ n ] ) is of fisher - kpp type . the classical fisher - kpp equation",
    ", @xmath7 describes the growth and spread of a population structured by a space variable @xmath1 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 is a positive constant .",
    "the behavior of solutions to ( [ kpp ] ) has been widely studied , starting from its introduction in @xcite . the most important difference between (",
    "[ n ] ) and the fisher - kpp equation is that the reaction term in ( [ n ] ) is nonlocal in the trait variable .",
    "this is because competition for resources , which is represented by the reaction term , occurs between individuals of _ all _ traits that are present in a certain location .",
    "another key feature of ( [ n ] ) is that the trait @xmath9 affects how fast an individual moves  this is why the coefficient of the spacial diffusion in ( [ n ] ) depends on @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the trait is subject to mutation , which is modeled by the diffusion term in @xmath9 .",
    "thus , ( [ n ] ) describes the interaction between dispersion of a population and the evolution of the motility trait .",
    "we further discuss the biological motivation for ( [ n ] ) and review the relevant literature in more detail later on in the introduction .      throughout our paper , we assume that the trait space @xmath3 is a bounded interval @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive constants .",
    "we study classical solutions of ( [ n ] ) with initial condition that is non - negative and  regular enough . \" we state these assumptions precisely as ( a[asump c2 ] ) , ( a[asm n0 ] ) and ( a[asm theta ] ) in section [ sec : asm ] .",
    "a significant challenge for us is that ( [ n ] ) does not enjoy the maximum principle .",
    "this is due to the presence of the nonlocal reaction term .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to establish a global upper bound for solutions of ( [ n ] ) .",
    "we prove :    [ sup bd intro ] suppose @xmath13 is nonnegative , twice differentiable on @xmath14 and satisfies ( [ n ] ) in the classical sense , with initial condition @xmath15 that satisfies ( a[asm n0 ] ) .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath16 such that @xmath17    theorem [ sup bd intro ] is a key element in the proof of our second main result .",
    "previous work on the fisher - kpp equation @xcite and formal computations concerning ( [ n ] ) @xcite suggest that solutions to ( [ n ] ) should converge to a travelling front in @xmath1 and @xmath18 . in order to study the motion of the front",
    ", we perform the rescaling @xmath19 .",
    "this rescaling leads us to consider solutions @xmath20 of the @xmath21-dependent problem , @xmath22 ( we point out that ( [ nep ] ) is _ not _ the rescaled version of the @xmath21-independent problem ( [ n ] ) , as we consider initial data @xmath23 , instead of @xmath24 , in ( [ nep ] ) .",
    "please see remark [ remark : relationship ] for more about this . )",
    "we study the limit of the @xmath20 as @xmath25 .",
    "we find that there exists a set on which the sequence @xmath20 converges locally uniformly to zero , and another set on which a certain limit of @xmath26 stays strictly positive .",
    "these sets are determined by two viscosity solutions of the hamilton - jacobi equation , @xmath27 the function @xmath28 arises from the eigenvalue problem ( [ spectral ] ) and is determined by @xmath29 , @xmath11 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 ( see proposition [ prop : spectral ] ) .",
    "one may view the function @xmath30 as encoding the effect of the motility trait on the limiting behavior of the @xmath20 .",
    "our main result , theorem ( [ result on n ] ) , says that the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hj ] ) describes the motion of an interface which separates areas with and without individuals .",
    "viscosity solutions of ( [ hj ] ) with infinite initial data play a key role in our analysis and we provide a short appendix where we discuss the relevant known results . for the purposes of the introduction",
    ", we state the following lemma :    [ lem intro ] for any @xmath31 , there exists a unique continuous function @xmath32 that is a viscosity solution of ( [ hj ] ) in @xmath33 and satisfies the initial condition @xmath34 in addition , we have @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    we are interested in @xmath38 for two sets @xmath39 determined by the initial data @xmath15 .",
    "we define these two sets , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , by @xmath42 we see that @xmath1 belongs to @xmath40 if initially there is at least _ some _ individual living at @xmath40 , and @xmath1 belongs to @xmath41 if individuals with _ all _ traits are present at @xmath1 .",
    "our main result says that the limiting behavior of the @xmath20 is determined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 :    [ result on n ] assume ( a[asump c2 ] ) , ( a[asm n0 ] ) and ( a[asm theta ] ) .",
    "let @xmath43 and @xmath44 be the functions given by lemma [ lem intro ] .",
    "then , @xmath45 and @xmath46    let us remark on a special case of theorem [ result on n ] .",
    "suppose the initial data @xmath15 is such that the two sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 are equal ( this occurs if , for example , @xmath15 is independent of @xmath9 ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath47 and so @xmath48 , which means that theorem [ result on n ] gives information about the limiting behavior of @xmath20 _ almost everywhere _ on @xmath49 , for all times @xmath18 .",
    "we present the following corollary :    [ corc*informal ] assume ( a[asump c2 ] ) , ( a[asm n0 ] ) and ( a[asm theta ] ) .",
    "let us also suppose that each of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a bounded interval",
    ". there exists a positive constant @xmath50 , which depends only on @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath29 and @xmath11 , such that    * if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 for all @xmath2 ; and , * if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 .",
    "the proof of corollary [ corc*informal ] is in subsection [ subsect : pf of cors ] .",
    "it uses the work of majda and souganidis @xcite concerning a class of equations of the form ( [ hj ] ) but with more general hamiltonians .",
    "[ remarkbc ] corollary [ corc*informal ] directly connects our result to the main result of bouin and calvez @xcite .",
    "indeed , theorem 3 of @xcite says that there exists a travelling wave solution of ( [ n ] ) of speed @xmath50 , for the same @xmath50 as in corollary [ corc*informal ] . while it is not known whether solutions of ( [ n ] ) converge to a travelling wave , corollary [ corc*informal ] is a result in this direction  it says that , in the limit as @xmath25 , the regions where the @xmath20 is positive and zero travel with speed @xmath50 .",
    "the biological question is , as time goes on , which territory will be occupied by the species and which will be left empty ? to answer this question , it is enough to determine where the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are zero . in fact , corollary [ corc*informal ] gives information about the limit of the @xmath20 simply in terms of the sets @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and a constant @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , we see that at time @xmath18 , if we stand a point that is  far \" from @xmath40 , then there are no individuals at @xmath1 . on the other hand , if we stand at a point @xmath1 that is  pretty close \" to @xmath41 , then there are some individuals living near @xmath1 .",
    "we formulate another corollary :    [ cor : onn ] assume ( a[asump c2 ] ) , ( a[asm n0 ] ) , ( a[asm theta ] ) and that @xmath40 and @xmath41 are bounded intervals . then :    * if @xmath55 , then @xmath52 for all @xmath2 ; and , * if @xmath56 , then @xmath54 .",
    "we remind the reader of the fact , due to aronson and weinberger @xcite , that @xmath57 is the asymptotic speed of propagation of fronts for ( [ kpp ] ) .",
    "thus , a consequence of corollary [ cor : onn ] is that , in the limit , the population we re considering spreads slower than one with constant motility @xmath11 and faster than one with constant motility @xmath29 .",
    "we give the proof of corollary [ cor : onn ] in subsection [ subsect : pf of cors ] .",
    "in addition , please see remark [ rem : interpret ] for further comments on the biological implications of our results .",
    "biologists are interested in the interplay between traits present in a species and how the species interacts with its environment  in other words , between evolution and ecology @xcite .",
    "it has been observed , for example in butterflies in britain @xcite , that an expansion of the territory that a species occupies may coincide with changes in a certain trait  the butterflies that spread to new territory were able to lay eggs on a larger variety of plants than the butterflies in previous generations .",
    "the phenotypical trait in this case is related to adaptation to a fragmented habitat .",
    "some biologists have focused specifically on the interaction between ecology and traits that affect motility .",
    "phillips et al @xcite recently discovered a species of cane toads whose territory has , over the past 70 years , spread with a speed that _ increases _ in time .",
    "this is very interesting because this is contrary to what is predicted by the fisher - kpp equation @xcite and has previously been observed empirically @xcite .",
    "spacial sorting was also observed  the toads that arrive first in the new areas have longer legs than those in the areas that have been occupied for a long time .",
    "in addition , it was discovered that toads with longer legs are able to travel further than toads with shorter legs .",
    "it is hypothesised that the presence of this trait  length of legs  is responsible for both the front acceleration and the spacial sorting .",
    "similar phenomena were observed in crickets in britain over a shorter time period @xcite . in that case , the motility trait was wingspan .",
    "the cases we describe demonstrate the need to understand the influence of a trait  in particular , a motility trait  on the dynamics of a population .",
    "the fisher - kpp equation has been extensively studied , and we refer the reader to @xcite for an introduction .",
    "hamilton - jacobi equations similar to ( [ hj ] ) are known to arise in the analysis of the long - time and long - range behavior of ( [ kpp ] ) , other reaction - diffusion pde , and systems of such equations ",
    "see , for example , friedlin @xcite , evans and souganidis @xcite and barles , evans and souganidis @xcite and fleming and souganidis @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite are a key part of our analysis of ( [ nep ] ) .",
    "as we previously mentioned , ( [ kpp ] ) describes populations structured by space alone , while there is a need to study the interaction of dispersion and phenotypical traits ( in particular , motility traits ) .",
    "most models of populations structured by space and trait either consider a trait that does not affect motility or do not consider the effect of mutations .",
    "champagnat and mlard @xcite start with an individual - based model of such a population and derive a pde that describes its dynamics .",
    "in the case that the trait affects only the growth rate and not the motility , alfaro , coville and raoul @xcite study this pde , which is a reaction - diffusion equation with constant diffusion coefficient : @xmath58 the population modeled by ( [ acr ] ) has a preferred trait that varies in space .",
    "berestycki , jin and silvestre @xcite analyze an equation similar to ( [ acr ] ) , but with a different kernel @xmath41 and growth term @xmath6 that represent the existence of a trait that is favorable for all individuals .",
    "the aims and methods of @xcite are quite different from those in this paper .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the existence of traveling wave solutions of ( [ acr ] ) for speeds above a critical threshold . in @xcite",
    ", the authors establish the existence and uniqueness of travelling wave solutions and prove an asymptotic speed of propagation result for the equation that they consider .",
    "we also mention that a local version of ( [ acr ] ) was investigated by berestycki and chapuisat @xcite .",
    "desvillettes , ferriere and prvost @xcite and arnold , desvillettes and prvost @xcite study a model in which the dispersal rate does depend on the trait and the trait is subject to mutation , but the mutations are represented by a nonlocal linear term , not a diffusive term .",
    "there has also been analysis of traveling waves and steady states for equations of the form @xmath59 where the reaction term @xmath60 is the convolution of @xmath61 with some kernel @xmath62 .",
    "we refer the reader to berestycki , nadin , perthame and ryzhik @xcite , hamel and ryzhik @xcite , fang and zhao @xcite , alfaro and coville @xcite and the references therein .",
    "an important difference between ( [ kernel ] ) and ( [ n ] ) is that the reaction term of ( [ n ] ) is local in the space variable and nonlocal in the trait variable , while the reaction term in ( [ kernel ] ) is fully nonlocal .",
    "the long time behavior of solutions to ( [ kernel ] ) is studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.2 ) establishes a supremum bound for solutions of ( [ kernel ] ) .",
    "bouin and mirrahimi @xcite analyze the reaction - diffusion equation @xmath63 with neumann conditions on @xmath61 on the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "the main difference between ( [ eqnbm ] ) and ( [ n ] ) is that the coefficient of spacial diffusion in ( [ eqnbm ] ) is constant , which means that ( [ eqnbm ] ) models a population where the trait does not affect motility .",
    "the methods we use here are similar to those of @xcite ( and , in turn , both ours and those of @xcite are similar to those used in @xcite to study ( [ kpp ] ) ) .",
    "however , in general it is easier to obtain certain bounds for solutions of ( [ eqnbm ] ) than for solutions of ( [ n ] ) .",
    "for example , because the coefficient of @xmath64 in ( [ eqnbm ] ) is constant , integrating ( [ eqnbm ] ) in @xmath9 implies that @xmath65 is a subsolution of a local equation in @xmath1 and @xmath18 that enjoys the maximum principle .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath65 is globally bounded ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) .",
    "this strategy does not work for ( [ n ] ) .",
    "indeed , a serious challenge in studying ( [ n ] ) , as opposed to ( [ kpp ] ) or nonlocal reaction diffusion equations with constant diffusion coefficient such as ( [ eqnbm ] ) , is obtaining a global supremum bound for solutions of ( [ n ] ) .",
    "another challenge that arises in our situation but not in @xcite is in establishing certain gradient estimates in @xmath9 ( see remark [ rem : gradbdbm ] ) . in addition",
    ", we compare our main result , theorem [ result on n ] , with that of @xcite in remark [ remrho ] .",
    "let us discuss the literature that directly concerns ( [ n ] ) and ( [ nep ] ) .",
    "the problem ( [ n ] ) was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the rescaling leading to ( [ nep ] ) was suggested by bouin , calvez , meunier , mirrahimi , perthame , raoul , and voituriez in @xcite .",
    "in addition , formal results about the asymptotic behavior of solutions to ( [ n ] ) were obtained in @xcite . in particular , part ( i ) of proposition [ main result ] of our paper was predicted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "( we briefly remark on the term  motility . \"",
    "it was used heavily in @xcite , which is where we first learned of the problem ( [ n ] ) . however , one of the referees of our paper pointed out that this term applies mainly to unicellular organisms . )",
    "bouin and calvez @xcite also study ( [ n ] ) .",
    "they prove that there exist traveling wave solutions to ( [ n ] ) but do not analyze whether solutions converge to a traveling wave .",
    "in fact , to our knowledge , there are no previous rigorous results about the asymptotic behavior of solutions of ( [ n ] ) or the limiting behavior of solutions to ( [ nep ] ) .",
    "the main difficulty is the lack of comparison principle for ( [ n ] )",
    ". please see corollary [ corc*informal ] , remark [ remarkbc ] , as well as the fourth point below , for further discussion of the connections between the results of our paper and those of @xcite .",
    "* to the best of our knowledge , theorem [ sup bd intro ] is the first global supremum bound for a fisher - kpp type equation with a nonlocal reaction term and non - constant diffusion . *",
    "theorem [ result on n ] completes the program that was proposed in @xcite for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the model ( [ n ] ) in the case where the trait space @xmath3 is bounded .",
    "* we view our main result , theorem [ result on n ] , as evidence that the presence of a motility trait does affect the limiting behavior of populations .",

    "* we hope that our work is a step towards analyzing ( [ n ] ) in the case where the trait space @xmath3 is unbounded .",
    "it is in this case that the phenomena of accelerating fronts is predicted to occur @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem [ sup bd intro ] is quite involved .",
    "the difficulty comes from the combination of the nonlocal reaction term and non - constant diffusion .",
    "our proof of theorem [ sup bd intro ] uses regularity estimates for solutions of elliptic pde , a heat kernel estimate , and an averaging technique similar to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) .",
    "we believe this combination of methods is new and may be useful in other contexts .",
    "we include a detailed outline in subsection [ subsec : outline ] .",
    "to analyze the limit of the @xmath20 , we preform the transformation @xmath66 such a transformation is used in @xcite .",
    "we prove locally uniform estimates on @xmath67 :    [ bd on utheta ] assume ( a[asump c2 ] ) , ( a[asm n0 ] ) and ( a[asm theta ] ) and let @xmath67 be given by ( [ def : up ] ) .",

    "moreover , the gradient estimate of proposition [ bd on utheta ] implies @xmath67 becomes independent of @xmath9 as @xmath21 approaches zero .",
    "thus , it is natural that @xmath75 and @xmath76 should be independent of @xmath9 .",
    "there is also a connection to homogenization theory  we can think of @xmath9 as the  fast \" variable , which disappears in the limit .",
    "it is the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hj ] ) , which arises in the @xmath25 limit , that captures the effect of the  fast \" variable .",
