    "mixing between the strange meson states of two axial - vector octets was established through their decay modes , mass splitting , and production in the @xmath7 decay @xcite . in the zeroth order approximation ,",
    "the mixing is maximal within large uncertainties according to the current experimental information .",
    "the bes collaboration recently reported on the @xmath6 decays of the orthocharmonia @xcite . in their measurement , the branching fraction br@xmath8 is far dominant over br@xmath9 , while it is in the other way in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "if one ignores one - photon annihilation and assumes the maximal mixing , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 branching fractions would be equal to each other both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "we study here implications of the bes data on the @xmath2 mixing .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first to show that the bes measurement of the @xmath12 @xcite is perfectly consistent with the @xmath2 mixing when one - photon annihilation is properly added to three - gluon annihilation , and second to show that the cleanest determination of the mixing angle from the @xmath6 decay of orthcharmonia is to measure the neutral modes of @xmath13 .",
    "our analysis is based on flavor su(3 ) symmetry with the following standard assumptions .",
    "\\(1 ) the decay occurs through three - gluon annihilation and also through one - photon annihilation . while the former is dominant over the latter , their relative magnitude is left as a parameter .",
    "\\(2 ) the strange meson components of the axial - vector octets mix with each other .",
    "the mixing angle is roughly @xmath14 , but with large uncertainties .",
    "\\(3 ) flavor su(3 ) invariance is valid for strong interactions apart from the meson mixing .",
    "the electromagnetic current of the light quarks is an octet with negative charge conjugation .",
    "two axial - vector meson octets have been known .",
    "they form approximate nonets like the vector mesons though one state is still missing : @xmath15 @xmath16 where the numbers in boldface are su(3 ) representations . @xmath17 and @xmath18 mix through su(3 ) breaking to form mass eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath20 as @xmath21 similarly for @xmath22 with @xmath23 . the mixing coefficients in eq.([mixing ] )",
    "are real provided that the dispersive part dominates over the absorptive part in the mass matrix .",
    "it should be noted that the signs of @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be absorbed into the phases of particle states or fields .",
    "hereafter we shall choose the phase convention of states such that @xmath26    since @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 plus a pseudoscalar octet @xmath30 can not form an su(3 ) singlet of negative charge conjugation , the three - gluon annihilation allows only @xmath31 in contrast , the one - photon annihilation allows most of @xmath6 : @xmath32 let us denote the decay amplitude of eq.([m0 ] ) by @xmath33 , and the amplitudes for the first and second processes of eq.([mv ] ) by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively",
    ". then we can describe the decay branching fractions of @xmath0 or @xmath1 into @xmath36 by three parameters , @xmath37 we distinguish the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath1 from those for @xmath0 by attaching them primes ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the standard su(3 ) analysis gives the decay amplitudes as shown in table 1 .",
    "for the channels involving @xmath42 or @xmath43 , the @xmath44 coupling has been related to the @xmath45 coupling by the ideally mixed nonet scheme @xcite or simply the naive quark model .",
    "since the processes are two - body decays on mass shell , the amplitude ratios are actually coupling ratios . therefore @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 can be chosen to be real numbers .",
    "we have only sign ambiguity instead of continuous phase ambiguity , when different terms interfere in squared matrix elements .",
    "a few parameter - independent relations can be read off from table 1 .",
    "@xmath48 this relation is actually a consequence of charge conjugation invariance and the isospin property of electromagnetic current alone , not of su(3 ) symmetry : since @xmath49 is g odd , only the isoscalar part of electromagnetic current is capable of producing @xmath49 in one - photon annihilation",
    ". then the relation ( [ isospinrule ] ) follows immediately .",
    "only photon - loop corrections on the light quarks can violate it .",
    "this is one of the special cases where even the photon interaction can not violate isospin nor g parity invariance . despite the very robust nature of the relation ,",
    "the current data are only marginally consistent with it : br@xmath50 _ vs _ br@xmath51@xcite .",
    "it has been known that the similar equality br@xmath52 br@xmath53 is not well satisfied @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 mixing is probably responsible for the violation .",
    "the other parameter - independent relation from table 1 is : @xmath55 to test this sum rule , we need measurement of the @xmath56 mode .",
    "more interesting is the relation , @xmath57 it will be able to determine @xmath58 directly without referring to other parameters . in this paper",
    "we focus on @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 on which bes collaboration shed a light .",
    "the decay pattern of the @xmath61 mesons first alerted theorists of the @xmath2 mixing .",
    "earlier theoretical works @xcite pointed to the maximal mixing of @xmath62 .",
    "the maximal mixing occurs if the diagonal elements of the @xmath2 mass matrix are exactly equal .",
    "phenomenologically , however , the latest decay data still allow for sizable uncertainty @xcite : @xmath63 since the masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not directly measurable , they must be computed by theory",
    ". therefore determination of the @xmath2 diagonal mass difference is subject to uncertainties of theoretical assumptions , some kinematical and others dynamical . in our analysis below , we treat the entire range of eq.([thetarange ] ) as allowed .",
    "we can make a crude estimate of magnitude of ( @xmath64 ) and ( @xmath65 ) by comparing the integrated decay rates of three - gluon and one - photon annihilation . from measurement @xcite we know @xmath66 the square roots of the right - hand sides give us an indication of the amplitude ratios .",
    "there is no compelling reason to equate these numbers to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , or @xmath46 and @xmath47 of exclusive channels . with no better clue at hand ,",
    "however , we use eq.([ratio ] ) to set the ballpark ranges in which the parameter values are found .",
    "our parameters are so normalized in table 1 that the ratio of sum of the one - photon rates over all @xmath67 channels to sum of the three - gluon rates is equal to @xmath68 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath38 is chosen in parallel to that of @xmath39 . if we equate @xmath68 to the number in the first line of eq.([ratio ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that @xmath70 is in a range similar to that of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore our very crude estimate or guess is : @xmath72 by the same assumption we obtain for @xmath1 @xmath73 in terms of amplitudes , the one - photon process is by no means a small correction . in fact , it is known that in some exclusive decay channels g parity and/or su(3 ) violating amplitudes are comparable to corresponding conserved ones . for instance , we find in the review of particle physics @xcite the wrong - to - right g parity amplitude ratio @xmath74 ^{1/2}\\approx 0.8 $ ] .",
    "we shall keep eqs.([xieta ] ) and , ( [ xieta ] ) in mind in the following analysis .",
    "for @xmath0 the average of two measurements on the decay @xmath75 is @xcite : @xmath76 the new bes measurements are : @xmath77 @xmath78 in addition , the bes collaboration measured three @xmath6 decay modes of @xmath1 : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81    the most conspicuous is the pattern that @xmath82 is suppressed in the @xmath0 decay while @xmath83 is suppressed in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "this is incompatible with the zeroth order picture of the maximally mixed @xmath2 combined with three - gluon annihilation dominance .",
    "we ask whether inclusion of one - photon annihilation and possibly a deviation of @xmath58 from @xmath14 can explain this pattern or not .",
    "the ratio of the two @xmath3 amplitudes can be expressed in our parametrization as @xmath84 the amplitude ratio of @xmath85 to @xmath86 is subject to the experimental constraint from eqs.([psib ] ) and ( [ psik1 ] ) : @xmath87 the number in the last line has been extracted with the s - wave decay assumption .",
    "mixture of d - wave tends to raise the magnitude of the central value , for instance , from @xmath88 to @xmath89 for @xmath90 mixture of d - wave . in order to suppress br@xmath91 relative to br@xmath92",
    ", the three - gluon and one - photon terms must interfere destructively in the former and constructively in the latter",
    ". therefore @xmath38 must be negative according to eq.([psikk ] ) .",
    "since @xmath38 and @xmath39 enter eqs.([psikk ] ) and ( [ btok ] ) only through the ratio @xmath93 , we can eliminate this ratio and express eq.([psikk ] ) in terms of @xmath58 and the experimental value of eq.([btokexp ] ) . in fig.1",
    "we have plotted the ratio @xmath94 as a function of @xmath95 .",
    "we see that any value of @xmath58 between @xmath96 and @xmath97 produces a number much smaller than the experimental upper bound , @xmath98 we must make sure that we can find values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the acceptable range of eq.([xieta ] ) under the constraint of eq.([btok ] ) .",
    "it happens that this constraint is insensitive to @xmath58 ( @xmath99 ) . for illustration",
    "we have shown in fig.2 the range of ( @xmath64 ) that correctly produces eq.([btokexp ] ) for @xmath62 .    irrespective of values of @xmath58 , preferred values for @xmath38 and @xmath39 are always near one of the boundary corners ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) of eq.([xieta ] ) .",
    "if we allow for an upward experimental error ( making smaller in absolute value ) in eq.([btokexp ] ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be made smaller in magnitude .",
    "an upward shift of one standard deviation of eq.([btokexp ] ) would raise the prediction in fig.1 to the thin broken curve .",
    "therefore the bes measurement of the decay @xmath102 can be accommodated with theory once a right amount of the one - photon annihilation contribution is added .",
    "we want to be consistent with the measurement @xmath103 with the matrix element ratio , @xmath104 positive @xmath46 suppresses the numerator by destructive interference .",
    "we have the experimental information on the ratio of @xmath105 to @xmath86 : @xmath106 again expressing the ratio eq.([psikk ] ) as a function of @xmath58 alone , we have plotted the ratio @xmath107 in fig.3 .",
    "we obtain the solid curve for @xmath107 when we take the central value in eq.([btok ] ) . as in the case of @xmath0 , any value of @xmath58 between @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "is consistent with the experimental upper bound on @xmath107 .",
    "values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constrained by the ratio of @xmath105 to @xmath86 of eq.([btok ] ) .",
    "fig.4 depicts the allowed ranges for @xmath46 and @xmath47 when @xmath108 , and @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 must be on the solid straight line when the central value is taken in eq.([btok ] ) .",
    "this time the constraint on @xmath46 and @xmath47 are mildly dependent on @xmath58 . though we can find @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the acceptable range ( [ xieta ] ) for any value of @xmath58 , @xmath46 can be smaller when @xmath109 than when @xmath110 .",
    "if we make a downward shift of the number in eq.([btok ] ) , even smaller values would be allowed for @xmath46 .",
    "however we can make such a shift only by a half standard deviation or less , depending on @xmath58 , in order to be compatible with the upper bound on @xmath107 .",
    "the situation is shown in fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "let us summarize our numerical analysis : after a reasonable amount of the one - photon annihilation amplitudes is included , any value of @xmath58 between @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be consistent with the @xmath6 decay modes of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 that have been so far measured .",
    "no stringent constraint is imposed on the one - photon annihilation amplitudes of those decay modes either .",
    "therefore the characteristic of the bes measurement that may look surprising at the first sight is not a surprise at all .",
    "when future experiment measures the neutral modes of @xmath13 and @xmath111 , they will allow us to restrict the ranges of parameters more stringently .",
    "our su(3 ) parametrization gives us @xmath112 as parameters sweep in the currently allowed region , these ratios change over a wide range both above and below unity . for the purpose of fixing the mixing angle ,",
    "the ratio @xmath113 is by far the cleanest source ( cf .",
    "eq.([k10 ] ) ) . as for the @xmath49 modes , @xmath114 is a robust prediction which follows from the isospin and charge conjugation property of the electromagnetic current .",
    "violation of this equality would mean that emission and reabsorption of a photon somewhere inside the light quark sector is enhanced .",
    "if @xmath54 mixing should cause a substantial misidentification of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , we would have to modify our analysis by including this @xmath117 mixing .    to draw a definite conclusion on the @xmath2 mixing from the @xmath6 decays of orthocharmonia",
    ", we shall have to wait until the neutral modes @xmath118 , @xmath119 @xcite and @xmath120 are measured .",
    "in addition , a more accurate measurement of the @xmath121 ratio in the @xmath0 decay is desired .    * acknowledgements * 0.5 cm i thank s. olsen for calling my attention to the new measurement of the bes collaboration and for the subsequent communications that prompted me to go through this analysis .",
