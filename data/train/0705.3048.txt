    "we note that the dynamics of the sn remnant are governed mainly by the explosion energy , together with the igm density distribution , and that the composition and metal content of the stellar ejecta become important only at very late times when the enriched gas recollapses ( see  5.1 ) .      during the early evolution of the sn remnant , i.e. , typically less than @xmath22 after the explosion",

    "throughout its lifetime , the remnant goes through four evolutionary stages , each of which is characterized by a different physical mechanism becoming dominant . based on this chronological sequence ,",

    "according to  2.2 , the simulation begins when the shock undergoes a transition to the st phase .",
    "since we have already discussed the properties of the st solution in  2.3 , we can apply these results to understand the early behavior of the sn remnant . with the knowledge that the previous photoheating has created an average density profile of @xmath86 in the vicinity of the progenitor ( fig . 8_a _ ) , we find with the help of equation ( 5 ) that the shock approaches @xmath66 after about @xmath87 . at this point",
    "it catches up with the previously established photoheating shock , where the outlying density profile becomes isothermal .",
    "the simulation results ( fig . 8_b _ ) agree with this analytic prediction , yet the profiles do not quite resemble the st solution , partly because not enough time has passed , but also because cooling in the dense shell becomes important , violating energy conservation . consequently , the st phase ends and the remnant undergoes a second transition .    to understand the origin of this transition , we elaborate on the cooling mechanisms responsible for radiating away the thermal energy of the remnant . at the high temperatures behind the shock , these are h and he resonance processes ( rps ) , bremsstrahlung ( bs ) , and ic scattering , with the former consisting of collisional ionization , excitation , and recombination cooling .",

    "figure 6 shows this analytic relation for the initial conditions of the simulation , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath29 . confirming the simulation results",
    ", this prediction yields that rps efficiently cool the dense shell to @xmath54 after about @xmath87 . at this point",
    "the shocked gas separates into a hot , interior bubble with temperatures above @xmath88 and a dense shell at @xmath54 bounded by a high - pressure gradient .",

    "valid , the st phase ends before the shock has relaxed to the asymptotic solution , yet we nevertheless find that @xmath93 fits the temporal scaling of the mass - weighted mean shock radius relatively well ( see fig . 7 ) .    .",

    "since @xmath97 in an @xmath98 density profile and @xmath99 in the adiabatically expanding interior , one can solve the above equation with a power law of the form @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly , this procedure yields the same temporal scaling as the st solution , and we therefore do not expect a change in slopes after @xmath87 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the transition to the pds phase once the shock approaches the isothermal density profile in the outskirts of the halo .",
    "figure 7 confirms this result , as the simulation shows only a slight deviation from the analytically derived @xmath100 slope .    using the above model",
    ", we can further determine when the pds phase ends .",
    "the pressure directly behind the shock after @xmath87 can be estimated with equation ( 3 ) as @xmath101 , in agreement with the simulation ( see fig .",
    "8_b _ ) . with @xmath99 and @xmath93 , we further find @xmath102 , implying that after roughly @xmath38 the interior pressure has dropped to @xmath103 . at this point pressure equilibrium between the hot interior and the dense shell",
    "has been established , and the shock is driven solely by its accumulated inertia .",
    "figure 8_c _ confirms this prediction , showing that the interior pressure has indeed dropped to that of the dense shell .",
    "in contrast , the temperature only drops proportional to @xmath104 and remains high .      with the pressure gradient",
    "no longer dominant , the sn remnant is driven by the accumulated inertia of the dense shell and becomes a momentum - conserving snowplow ( mcs ) . in analogy to the derivation performed in  3.3 , the position of the shock as a function of time can be obtained by solving equation ( 8) in the absence of a pressure term . since the shock has not yet propagated beyond the surrounding @xmath98 density profile , this yields an initial scaling of @xmath105 .    at later times , the shock finally leaves the host halo and encounters neighboring minihalos in the y - z plane , but underdense voids perpendicular to the y - z plane ( see fig .",
    "this increases its radial dispersion , while at the same time the hubble expansion becomes important and serves to expand the medium on which the sn remnant propagates , thus raising its physical shock velocity .",

    "we find a final swept - up mass of @xmath3.,width=302,height=188 ]",
    "so far we have concentrated on the propagation of the sn remnant into the igm and treated neighboring minihalos as disturbances to the radial density profile . in the following , we explicitly investigate the mechanical feedback of the sn on nearby minihalos and discuss possible consequences for star formation .",
    "for this purpose we have carried out two additional simulations , one without feedback and another with radiative feedback , which enable us to disentangle the effects of photoheating and the sn shock .",
    "combining the so - obtained results , figure 11 shows the distances of all star - forming halos from the initial sn progenitor as a function of expansion time , when they have reached the threshold density @xmath57 .",
    "following our argumentation in  2.4 , the halo irreversibly collapses at this point and forms a star .",
    "the shades of the symbols in figure 11 indicate their affiliation to the different simulations ( i.e. black , dark gray , and light gray symbols represent the no - feedback , photoheating - only , and main simulation runs ) , while the shapes of the symbols represent individual halos . for orientation , we show the mass - weighted mean shock radius at late times according to figure 7 .      in the photoheating - only case , we find that the collapse of all three star - forming halos is delayed ( see fig .",
    "while we do not properly resolve d - type ionization fronts that may develop within shielded minihalos , we find that ionizing radiation can penetrate deep into their cores and suppress cooling and the accretion of gas .",
    "the distance , mass , and maximum density of the halo at the onset of photoheating are all crucial for the extent of the delay . the most massive halo in our simulation , halo a , experiences a delay of only @xmath114 , while halos b and c are less dense at the time of photoheating and experience delays in excess of @xmath115 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the results of @xcite who argue that radiative feedback on neighboring minihalos strongly depends on their evolutionary stage ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for more quantitative results , one must perform self - consistent radiation - hydrodynamics simulations that include the effects of photodissociating radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    due to the inaccuracies mentioned above",
    ", we can not draw robust conclusions on the subsequent mode of primordial star formation , i.e. , pop  iii or pop  ii.5 , but we anticipate this to be a function of the state of the collapse and the ionizing flux ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to feedback by ionizing radiation , we find that in our case the shock of the sn remnant acts to enhance halo collapse and promote star formation .",
    "this behavior is evident from figure 11 , as halos a and b collapse about @xmath116 earlier with respect to the photoheating - only run . in both cases , the shock compresses the dense cores of each of the halos , which serves to enhance cooling and accretion .",
    "although our resolution is too crude for quantitative conclusions , we find that the mechanical impact of the sn remnant mitigates the delay caused by photoheating and leads to a slightly increased star formation rate",
    ". this situation might be different for star - forming halos much closer to the sn explosion , where ram pressure stripping could be sufficient to dispel a large fraction of the gas .",
    "however , in the present simulation we find that most halos massive enough to form stars are at sufficient distances from the sn progenitor .",
    "we note that we neglect the possible effects of photodissociating radiation emanating from the relic h  ii region , as it has been shown that recombination radiation can only produce a relatively weak photodissociating flux , which quickly dies away as the gas in the relic h  ii region recombines on timescales of the order of @xmath38 ( e.g. , johnson & bromm 2007 ; yoshida et al . 2007 ; see also glover 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , we are able to neglect the radiation generated by the supernova - shocked gas as a source of photodissociating radiation concerning neighboring minihalos , since the shock is only moving at velocities @xmath117 when it arrives at the star - forming minihalos mentioned above .",
    "this implies a photodissociating flux of @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is in units of @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "such a low level of flux will not have a substantial impact on the evolution of gas in collapsing minihalos , as it implies a timescale for photodissociation of h@xmath121 of the order of @xmath122 , much longer than the hubble time at the redshifts we consider ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a minihalo within @xmath123 of the sn explosion may be subject to a significant photodissociating flux , owing to the higher shock velocity at small distances .",
    "an important question is whether a large fraction of metals can penetrate neighboring halos and efficiently mix with their cores , thus changing the mode of star formation from pop  iii / pop  ii.5 to pop  ii .",
    "although a detailed quantitative analysis would require dedicated high - resolution simulations that are unavailable here , we can nevertheless estimate the mixing efficiency by applying the criterion for the operation of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities given by murray et al .",
    "( 1993 ; see also wyithe & cen 2007 ; cen & riquelme 2007 ) : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the gravitational acceleration at the virial radius , and @xmath126 the density ratio of gas in the halo compared to the dense shell . for the nearest star - forming halo with about @xmath127 and @xmath56 , we find @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the left - hand side of equation ( 9 ) is thus of order @xmath130 , suggesting that the gas at the outer edge of the halo will be disrupted and mix with the enriched material in the dense shell , while the core of the halo will remain pristine and stable .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the detailed simulations conducted by @xcite , and by the same arguments we find that halos b and c remain pristine as well .",
    "once again , we note that massive minihalos very close to the sn progenitor might experience a different behavior , as expansion velocities are of the order @xmath131 when the sn remnant leaves the host halo ( see fig .",
    "in such cases , the shock could disrupt the dense cores and trigger efficient mixing , leading to pop  ii star formation once the gas recollapses .",
    "various authors have suggested that cooling in the dense shell might lead to gravitational fragmentation and trigger secondary star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to the previous photoheating , the density of the surrounding medium is sufficiently lowered such that molecule formation is initially inefficient . even though we do not fully resolve the radiative shock front , we thus find that the continuous adiabatic expansion of the dense shell renders molecular cooling unimportant and does not trigger gravitational instabilities ( see  3.4 and fig .",
    "we note that the potential mixing of metals into the dense shell and the associated additional cooling might affect these results but postpone a more detailed discussion of this issue to future work .",
    "another scenario for secondary star formation is at the interface of colliding sn remnants .",
    "if such encounters take place in significantly overdense regions and occur relatively early in the evolution of individual sn remnants , densities might become high enough for gravitational fragmentation to occur .",
    "we have previously argued that mixing of enriched material with gas in existing star - forming halos is generally inefficient ( see  4.3 ) , indicating that the dispersal of metals can only occur via expulsion into the igm . in ",
    "3.5 we have shown that the bulk of the shock propagates into the voids surrounding the host halo , and we expect that chemical enrichment proceeds via the same channel ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this realization is crucial , as the detailed distribution of metals not only governs the transition to secondary star formation , but also the properties of the first galaxies , when the enriched material recollapses into larger potential wells .",
    "we shed some light on these issues by determining the influence of metal cooling on the evolution of the sn remnant and by discussing the transport of metals into the igm .",
    "although our resolution is too crude for a detailed analysis , we can nevertheless discuss the mixing efficiency in a qualitative manner and draw some preliminary conclusions on the ultimate fate of the expelled metals .    , but consisting solely of c , o , fe , and si ( in equal parts ) , while the dashed line represents ic cooling .",
    "the long - dashed line indicates when cooling becomes efficient , implying that metal cooling becomes momentarily important after @xmath91 , when the interior temperatures have dropped to @xmath132 and cooling rates peak .",
    "however , ic scattering becomes efficient at the same time and rapidly cools the enriched regions to below @xmath54 , where metal cooling rates drop by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently , the presence of metals does not effect the dynamical evolution of the sn remnant.,width=302,height=188 ]      during the first @xmath91 , the initial stellar ejecta expand adiabatically and apparently do not mix with the surrounding material ( see fig .",
    "in reality , however , the high electron mean free path behind the shock leads to heat conduction and gas from the dense shell evaporates into the hot , interior bubble ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "this effect is not included in the simulation , as it would only marginally affect the dynamics of the sn remnant , but the onset of rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and kh instabilities is predicted to efficiently mix the metals with primordial material evaporated from the dense shell , reducing the metallicity of the interior by a factor of a few to at most one order of magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the following , we assume that the overall metallicity has dropped by a factor of @xmath133 , to @xmath134 , in the course of the first million years .    to determine the importance of metal cooling , we proceed analogously to  3.2 and compare the expansion and cooling timescales of the interior bubble . for this purpose",
    "we adopt the cooling rates provided in @xcite for gas in collisional ionization equilibrium enriched to @xmath134 but consisting solely of c , o , fe , and si ( in equal parts ) .",
    "although this does not represent the specific yield of a pisn or a hypernova , we here only intend to give an approximate argument and defer a more precise treatment to future work .    assuming the time - dependent properties of the simulation , we find that metal cooling is only briefly important after @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "12 ) , when the interior has adiabatically cooled to @xmath132 and metal cooling is most efficient . at the same time , however , ic scattering becomes important and temperatures quickly fall to @xmath54 , where cooling rates drop by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "due to the low densities in the interior , the onset of fine structure cooling below @xmath54 also proves inefficient , and we conclude that even for initial metal yields as high as @xmath21 , metal cooling is unimportant for the entire dynamical evolution of the sn remnant .",
    "we emphasize that the presence of metals will become crucially important once the enriched gas has recollapsed into a sufficiently massive halo later on , thereby reaching high densities again .",
    "due to inefficient cooling , the evolution of the metal - enriched , interior bubble is governed by adiabatic expansion and preferentially propagates into the cavities created by the shock ( see figs . 8 and 14 ) .",
    "once the shock leaves the host halo and becomes highly anisotropic , the interior adopts the same behavior and expands into the voids surrounding the y - z plane in the shape of an hourglass , with a maximum extent similar to the final mass - weighted mean shock radius .",
    "this behavior is evident in figure 14 , where we plot the hydrogen number density and distribution of metal particles at various times after the sn explosion .",
    "furthermore , since the radius of each metal particle is determined by the smoothing length , we find that at late times the interior becomes substantially mixed with the initial stellar ejecta .",
    "when the shock finally stalls , the interior bubble is in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings , but it stays confined within the dense shell . to investigate the importance of rt instabilities in this configuration",
    ", we estimate the mixing length @xmath135 for large density contrasts between two media according to ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath136 where @xmath125 is the gravitational acceleration of the host halo .",
    "estimating the distance of the dense shell from the host halo with the final mass - weighted mean shock radius , we find that mixing between the dense shell and the interior bubble takes place on scales @xmath137 in the course of a few times @xmath91 . in light of the substantial extent of the interior , we conclude that such mixing is generally inefficient and that much larger potential wells must be assembled to recollect and mix all components of the shocked gas .",
    "specifically , turbulence arising in the virialization of the first galaxies could be an agent for this process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , mixing could be important in the y - z plane , where , due to the progression of structure formation , material falls in along filaments toward the metal - enriched gas near the host halo . since this mechanism will only affect a limited volume , while most metals are expelled into the voids ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , we again conclude that a fundamental transition in star formation from pop  iii / pop  ii.5 to pop  ii requires the assembly of a dm halo with a sufficiently deep potential well .    to find the minimum mass necessary to recollect the hot and underdense post - shock gas residing at @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( see  3.4 ) , we estimate by means of the cosmological jeans criterion that a dm halo of at least @xmath5 must be assembled .",
    "assuming that in the course of its virialization the initial stellar ejecta mix with the entire swept - up mass , we find a final , average metallicity of @xmath138 .",
    "although this value is well above @xmath139 , we emphasize that the final topology of metal enrichment could be highly inhomogeneous , with pockets of highly enriched material on the one hand , but regions with a largely primordial composition on the other hand .",
    "we have investigated the explosion of a @xmath0 pisn in the high - redshift universe by means of three - dimensional , cosmological simulations , taking into account all necessary chemistry and cooling . using a ray - tracing algorithm to determine the size and structure of the h  ii region around the progenitor star ,",
    "we have followed the evolution of the sn remnant until it effectively dissolves into the igm , and discussed its expansion and cooling properties in great physical detail .",
    "specifically , we have found that a chronological sequence in its evolution , based on various physical mechanisms becoming dominant , allows the introduction of a simple analytic model summarizing its expansion properties .",
    "the sn remnant propagates for a hubble time at @xmath1 to a final mass - weighted mean shock radius of @xmath2 , roughly half the size of the h  ii region , and in this process sweeps up a total gas mass of @xmath3 .",
    "we have found that its morphology becomes highly anisotropic due to encounters with filaments and neighboring minihalos in the y - z plane , but underdense voids perpendicular to the y - z plane .",
    "based on the high explosion energy , the host halo is entirely evacuated , while in our case shock compression of neighboring minihalos partially offsets the delay in star formation due to negative feedback from photoionization heating .",
    "in contrast , we do not observe gravitational fragmentation triggered by efficient cooling behind the sn shock , which could in principle lead to secondary star formation .",
    "we have found that the metal - enriched , interior bubble expands adiabatically into the cavities created by the shock and preferentially propagates into the voids of the igm with a maximum extent similar to the final mass - weighted mean shock radius .",
    "we have estimated that rt instabilities do not efficiently mix the dense shell with the interior , but that material falling in along filaments could mix with metal - enriched gas near the host halo . finally , we have concluded that a dm halo of at least @xmath5 must be assembled to recollect and mix all components of the shocked gas .",
    "based on the simulation , we find that a single pisn can enrich the local igm to a substantial degree .",
    "if energetic sne were indeed a common fate for the first stars , they might have deposited metals on large scales before massive galaxies formed and outflows were suppressed by their increasingly deep potential wells .",
    "hints on ubiquitous metal enrichment have recently been found in the low column density ly@xmath140 forest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way @xcite , where the presence of a `` bedrock '' metallicity was inferred . based on these observations ,",

    "although the frequency of pisne is debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have found that the overall dynamics of the sn remnant and the distribution of metals are largely independent of the progenitor and are governed mainly by the explosion energy .",
    "our simulations would therefore also approximately describe a hypernova explosion , where a rotating , massive star undergoes core collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such scenarios might better explain the peculiar yields found in extremely metal - poor stars in the galactic halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in light of the tentative identification of sn  2006gy as a pisn @xcite , we find that the plausibility of the pisn scenario is enhanced and that it provides a viable possibility for the ultimate fate of a very massive , metal - free star .",
    "when and where do the first pop  ii stars form ?",
    "based on the progression of structure formation , we expect that the first low - mass stars will form at the centers of the first galaxies , where primordial material streams in along filaments and mixes with the metal - enriched gas of the host halo . on the other hand , metals expelled into the voids are not so readily available , as the associated gas resides at too low densities and high temperatures . because of this diversity , secondary star formation in the virialization of the first galaxies will likely be a highly complicated and multi - faceted process . to understand the relevant mechanisms in detail",
    ", one must perform numerical simulations that include metal cooling as well as an efficient model for their mixing .",
    "furthermore , one must take into account the effects of multiple star - forming regions , including the expansion of additional h  ii regions and sn remnants .",
    "in future work , we hope to shed some light on these issues by performing detailed numerical simulations incorporating all the necessary physics and evolving them to sufficiently late times .",
