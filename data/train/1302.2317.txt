    "it is since the days of arnold sommerfeld , back to 1899 , that plasmonic effects in materials and gratings are investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "free electron plasma related phenomena in metallic gratings were investigated as early as 1902 by wood @xcite .",
    "an attempt to a theoretical interpretation of wood s results was first made by lord rayleigh @xcite , followed , three decades latter , by fano @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of plasmonic effects became possible with the work of kretschmann @xcite and otto @xcite , who devised two different methods , using prisms @xcite on top of or beneath a thin metallic film , of exciting surface plasmon  polaritons ( spps ) .",
    "spps are evanescent electromagnetic waves coupled to the free electron plasma oscillations , propagating along the surface of a conductor .",
    "meanwhile , reliable theoretical methods for studying scattering of electromagnetic radiation ( er ) by metallic gratings have been developed by several authors @xcite .",
    "modern plasmonics gained a renewed interest with the discovery of the anomalously high transmittance through a periodic array of holes with a size smaller than the diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "the effect was explained invoking surface plasmons ( sps ) @xcite .",
    "another impressive sp - related effect is the surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) @xcite . beyond the fundamental physics ,",
    "the plasmonics encompass a wide range of applications @xcite , such as spectroscopy and sensing @xcite , photovoltaics @xcite , optical tweezers @xcite , nano - photonics @xcite , radiation guiding @xcite , transformation and fourier optics @xcite , etc .",
    "these applications rely on the short wavelength of spps ( compared propagating photons of the same energy ) , strong dependence of their dispersion relation on the environment dielectric constant , and high local field intensity associated with localised sps .",
    "doped graphene sustains surface plasmons @xcite whose frequency is proportional to the 1/4 power of the electronic density , a result specific to single - layer graphene , and to the 1/2 power of the wave number , a behavior shared with the 2d electron gas @xcite",
    ". moreover , the carrier density in graphene can be varied continuously from nearly zero to @xmath0 for either type of majority carriers ( electrons or holes ) by the application of an external voltage .",
    "this important ambipolar doping effect has opened the tantalizing prospect of real time control of spps by using a gate .",
    "in addition , the transfer of graphene films to a range of substrates is routine nowadays and has inspired the design of graphene - based structures with unique plasmonic signatures , such as quantum dots ( or anti - dots ) @xcite and nanoribbons @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the question of whether the classical description of sps still holds for finite - size systems , such as quantum dots , is particularly relevant @xcite .",
    "the robustness of graphene spps with respect to external perturbations , as well as the interaction of spps with individual quantum systems , are active topics of research : the effect of applied stress in the graphene plasmon dispersion @xcite , and the role of spps in graphene on the decay rate of nano - emitters @xcite are now well established .",
    "plasmons in bilayer graphene have also attracted attention @xcite and the transverse electric ( te ) mode spectrum has recently been obtained @xcite .",
    "the plasmon dispersion relation of a graphene double - layer , two closely separated graphene sheets , has also been addressed @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of the study of propagation of spps in monolayer graphene is the investigation of the same effect in graphene double - layers . in this case , the two degenerate dispersion relations of each of the layers hybridize , giving rise to optical and acoustic branches @xcite .    a series of recent experimental works @xcite triggered a revival of interest to the plasmonic effects in graphene @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that graphene has a strong plasmonic response in the thz frequency range at room temperature @xcite .",
    "thz photonics is emerging as an active field of research @xcite and graphene may play a key role in thz metamaterials in the near future .",
    "_ have shown @xcite that er impinging on a grid of graphene microribbons can excite spps in graphene , leading to prominent absorption peaks , whose position can be tuned by doping .",
    "_ mapped the plasmon dispersion relation of graphene , and demonstrated the plasmonic tunability of graphene @xcite . in agreement with the theory,@xcite infrared spps in graphene",
    "have been shown to possess remarkably large propagation lengths when gauged against more conventional structures @xcite .",
    "a similar experiment was performed by chen _",
    "@xcite , where excitation and subsequent detection of spps were achieved .",
    "@xcite have shown that graphene / insulator stacks can be used as tunable infrared plasmonic devices , able to work both as a filter and as a polarizer , having the potential for far - infrared ( fir ) and thz photonic devices . as a proof of principle experiment ,",
    "it has been shown that this type of devices can shield 97.5% of er at frequencies below 1.2 thz @xcite .",
    "last , the possibility of transforming graphene into a mantle cloak , working in the thz spectral range , has also been addressed @xcite .    in general , spps",
    "can not be excited by directly shining light on a homogeneous system due to kinematic reasons : the momentum of a surface polariton is much larger than that of the incoming light having the same frequency .",
    "therefore , some type of mechanism is necessary to promote the excitation of spps .",
    "the most common mechanisms for spps excitation are : ( i ) attenuated total reflection ( atr ) @xcite , ( ii ) scattering from a topological defect at the conductor surface @xcite , and ( iii ) bragg scattering using diffraction gratings @xcite or a periodic corrugation of the surface of the conductor @xcite . the method of ju _",
    "is similar ( but not identical ) to the patterning of a metallic grating @xcite on top of graphene . a theoretical account of the experiment by ju _",
    "@xcite was given in a recent work @xcite .",
    "a novel method of spp excitation consists in using the apex of an illuminated nanoscale tip @xcite ; this method provides a two - orders of magnitude enhancement of the in - plane momentum relatively to that of the impinging er in free space bypassing the referred kinematic limitation .",
    "it has also been shown that modulation of the optical conductivity gives rise to efficient er coupling to spps in graphene @xcite without the need of a grating .",
    "the same principle works with split @xcite or modulated @xcite gates .",
    "free space excitation of spps using non - linear optics effects has been proposed @xcite and effectively put in action @xcite .",
    "the reason why a periodic corrugation allows for the excitation of spps can be understood in analogy with the theory of electrons in a periodic potential . here",
    "the periodic corrugation plays for spps the same role as the periodic atomic potential plays for electrons , that is , the spp momentum is conserved up to a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the periodic corrugation provides the missing momentum needed to excite the polariton .",
    "another way of understanding the effect is to note that the grating gives rise to a spp band structure .",
    "then the folding of the spp dispersion curve , forming bands in the first brillouin zone , makes it possible for an incident electromagnetic wave to excite a spp mode associated with the upper bands for the same wavevector .",
    "the excitation of spp modes in the first band still is not possible in the grating configuration unless the atr technique is used .",

    "the central idea of the emerging area of nanoplasmonics is the use of spps , coupled charge - radiation excitations existing at a dielectric / conductor interface , for applications ranging from chemical sensors and surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( able to detect a single molecule ) to solar cell s optimization .",
    "one of the most attractive features of spps is that they concentrate and guide er at subwavelength scales .",
    "this is appealing since one can conceive circuitry using metals embedded in dielectrics , which is able to propagate both electric signals and spps @xcite . in graphene",
    ", the spp wavelength can be about 40 times shorter than the wavelength of the impinging radiation in free space @xcite .",

    "graphene can be seen as the ultimate conductive thin film able to support spps @xcite . as in any other conductor ,",
    "the free charges in graphene couple to er . we seek solutions of maxwell s equations in the form of surface waves propagating along the graphene sheet .",
    "as we will see , graphene supports two different types of surface waves , the tm ( or @xmath4polarized ) and te ( or @xmath5polarized ) spps .      in the mks system of units ,",
    "the macroscopic maxwell s equations read @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the relative dielectric permittivity , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the vacuum dielectric and magnetic permeability , @xmath12 is the charge density ( charge per unit volume ) , and @xmath13 is the current density ( current per unit area ) .    in the case of a 2d metal , such as graphene , and assuming that it lies in the @xmath14plane , we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the surface current density ( current per unit length ) , @xmath17 is the surface charge density ( charge per unit area ) . for a 2d metal with a frequency  dependent ( optical ) conductivity @xmath1 , we have @xmath18 , where @xmath19 lies in the @xmath14plane as well .",

    "[ fig_bc ] ) : @xmath20 since graphene is a two - dimensional system , it enters in the calculation of the surface wave dispersion relation only through the boundary conditions .",
