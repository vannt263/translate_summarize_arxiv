    "<S> in a recent article [ arxiv:1108.5127 ] park has shown that the four - state predator - prey model studied earlier in _ j. stat . </S>",
    "<S> mech , l05001 ( 2011 ) _ belongs to directed percolation ( dp ) universality class . </S>",
    "<S> it was claimed that predator density is not a reasonable order parameter , as there are many absorbing states ; a suitably chosen order parameter shows dp critical behaviour . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the configuration that does not have any predator is the only dynamically accessible absorbing configuration , and the predator density too settles to dp critical exponents after a long transient .    </S>",
    "<S> ^s__a    systems having absorbing configurations may undergo a non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite from an active to an absorbing state . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior of these absorbing state phase transitions ( apts ) @xcite depends on the the symmetry of the order parameter and presence of additional conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> it has been conjectured @xcite that in absence of any special symmetry the apt belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class as long as the system has a single absorbing state .    </S>",
    "<S> since the coarse grained microscopic theory of dp , which is a birth - death - diffusion process , is based on a single component reggeon field theory@xcite , critical behavior in presence of additional field is expected to alter the critical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the additional field may bring in multiple absorbing states and/or additional conservation laws . </S>",
    "<S> presence of multiple absorbing states may @xcite or may not @xcite affect the universality . </S>",
    "<S> coupling of order parameter to a conserved field too lead to dp @xcite or non - dp @xcite critical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the models of directed percolation with more than one species @xcite , which brings in additional coarse grained fields , has also been studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predator - prey cellular automaton models @xcite in higher dimension too shows an apt to an absorbing ( extinct ) state which belongs to dp - class . </S>",
    "<S> the role of additional fields in these models are not quite well understood .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we studied a predator - prey model@xcite on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , where each lattice site is either vacant , occupied by a predator @xmath1 , a prey @xmath2 or both ( one @xmath1 and one @xmath2 ) . in these four state predator - prey ( 4spp ) model growth of preys and death of predators occurs independently , whereas death of a prey is always followed by instant birth of a predator . </S>",
    "<S> based on the numerical simulations and estimated critical exponents , we have suggested the possibility of a new universality class . in particular , the decay of clusters at the critical point was found to be distinctly different from those of dp . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a recent article park @xcite has suggested a different scenario . </S>",
    "<S> it was claimed that the predator density @xmath3 can not be taken as a order parameter as there are infinitely many absorbing states . </S>",
    "<S> the transition is found to be in dp class , when order parameter is chosen suitably . in this article , we show that although there are many absorbing states , only one of them @xmath4 is dynamically accessible . in fact </S>",
    "<S> the order parameter @xmath3 which was showing an apparently new critical behavior , slowly crosses over to dp .    for completeness , first let us define the model . on a one dimensional periodic lattice , </S>",
    "<S> each site is either vacant , or occupied by a single particle @xmath1 ( prey ) , or occupied by a single particle @xmath2 ( predator ) or by both particles ( co - existing @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) ; correspondingly at each site @xmath5 we have @xmath6 alternatively one may describe the 4-state predator - prey ( 4spp ) model considering two separate branches , one for @xmath1 and the other for @xmath2 particles , where particles living in one branch can not move to the other . </S>",
    "<S> we consider only the asymmetric case of the model which evolves according to the following dynamics , where @xmath7 denotes both presence and absence of particles in respective branches .    </S>",

    "<S> clearly these bond variables @xmath14 follow a dynamical rules , @xmath15 the neighbors are updated along with @xmath16 as follows . </S>",
    "<S> for dynamics ( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath17 is increased by @xmath18 whereas for dynamics ( [ eq:2 ] ) @xmath17 and @xmath19 are decreased by @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . clearly a bond @xmath5 is active when @xmath16 is either @xmath18 or @xmath22 , or it is greater than @xmath23 it was argued by park @xcite that the density of active bonds @xmath24 , the correct order parameter ( as there are infinitely many absorbing states ) of the system , vanishes at the critical point @xmath25 when @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the same parameter values , we had estimated earlier that predator density @xmath3 vanishes at @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this raises a question that possibly in the region @xmath29 , the system falls into an absorbing state which has isolated @xmath2s . </S>",
    "<S> however a configuration with one or more isolated @xmath2 can be absorbing only when there are no @xmath1s . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : pc](a ) it is evident that @xmath46 shows a saturation at @xmath47 for @xmath48 figure [ fig : pc](b ) shows log - scale plot of @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath49 it is evident that after a long transient @xmath42 decays as @xmath50 with @xmath51 , similar to @xmath52 such a change in @xmath53 to a lower value was appearing as a saturation in @xmath3 , leading to a lower estimate of the critical point .     </S>",
    "<S> vs @xmath35 at criticality ( @xmath54 @xmath37 and @xmath38)for @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the initial slope @xmath57 crosses over to @xmath58 as system size is increased . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : rhot_l ] ) by using dp critical exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60,width=491 ]    with this correct estimation of critical point , we proceed to calculate other critical exponents taking @xmath3 as the order parameter . as for finite system of size </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 , starting from a high density of predators , @xmath62 decays as @xmath50 , indicating a scaling form @xmath63 at the critical point , where @xmath64 is the dynamical critical exponent . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig : z_nu](a ) shows decay of @xmath67 for different @xmath61 starting from the configuration @xmath68 ; clearly small systems show an effective exponent @xmath57 which crosses over to @xmath69 as the system size is increased . </S>",
