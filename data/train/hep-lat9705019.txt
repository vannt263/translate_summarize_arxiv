    "most of the obtained results are expected to hold also in non - abelian gauge theories , at least qualitatively @xcite .",
    "the data accumulated so far , however , for larger flux tube lengths are not of sufficient accuracy to perform a quantitative analysis in terms of effective models for the formation of a gluonic flux tube .",

    "we will use the duality relation for expectation values in the presence of external charges to clarify the connection between dually transformed @xmath0 theory and the dual superconductor model . besides this support for the interpretation of the results , the dual theory provides a very efficient tool for simulating flux tubes .",

    "the constraint @xmath21 describes the absence of electric charges , @xmath22 .",
    "we solve this constraint by introducing an integer valued 3-form @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xmath25 where we have finally switched to the dual link variables @xmath26 , representing an integer valued dual potential .",
    "the product in the partition function extends over the links of the dual lattice .",
    "the next step is the inclusion of external charges into the @xmath0 path integral . @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the world - lines of a static charge pair .",
    "starting from @xmath29 one arrives at an expression equivalent to ( [ ztp ] ) , with a modified constraint @xmath30 for links belonging to @xmath31 ( equivalent to @xmath32 ) .",
    "this constraint is solved by an additional integer 2-form @xmath33 : @xmath34 external electric currents are represented by the boundaries of a dual dirac sheet in the dual theory .",
    "the dually transformed path integral therefore reads @xmath35 where the product is performed over all links of the dual lattice .",
    "the dual dirac sheet @xmath36 can be fixed as the minimal straight area between the two polyakov loops , while the integer gauge field @xmath26 is kept as dynamical variable and updated in simulations .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath26 result in fluctuations of the flux string @xmath37 .",
    "further , we will perform the duality transformation for the correlation function ( [ correlation ] ) . for the determination of the flux @xmath38 through a given plaquette @xmath39",

    "for the @xmath0 gauge theory , it is even possible to establish an exact connection at the level of the path integral .",

    "( [ higgs ] ) is zero , we realize that the integral over @xmath51 for each dual link reduces to a sum over an integer @xmath26 , according to the constraint @xmath80 .",

    "a @xmath0 flux tube looks rather like an infinitely thin fluctuating string than like a flux tube in a classical dual superconductor .",
    "this correspondence to the higgs model does not hold for energy densities .",
    "the dually transformed expectation value of the squared field strength , eq .",
    "( [ cos ] ) , obviously disagrees with the corresponding result in the @xmath79 limit of the dual higgs model .",
    "this is not astonishing , since the expectation values of the squared fields are connected to the vacuum fluctuations which show the opposite behaviour in the dual theory , where the confinement phase is the weakly coupled phase and fluctuations become more important with increasing @xmath81 .",
    "hence , a direct interpretation of the @xmath0 energy density in the dual higgs model is not possible , which makes it difficult to distinguish by analytical considerations between dual type - i and type - ii superconductivity .",
    "as has been pointed out above , one has to be careful when comparing @xmath0 lattice gauge theory to a dual higgs model on a `` microscopic '' level .",
    "nevertheless , simulating the dual @xmath0 gauge theory gives us the possibility to calculate any expectation value in the presence of static charges with significantly higher precision .",
    "this has several reasons : the confinement phase is the weakly coupled one in the dual theory , therefore we have less quantum fluctuations in the region of interest . simulating the dually transformed path integral ( [ sin ] ) resp .",
    "( [ cos ] ) is also much faster because of the integer valued gauge fields . most important ,",
    "however , is the fact that it is not necessary to project the charge  anticharge state out of the vacuum : charge pairs with arbitrary distance can be simulated with equal accuracy , as well as multiply charged systems @xcite .",
    "the updating procedure itself is very simple : as already discussed in the previous section , the dual dirac string sheet @xmath36 connecting the two polyakov lines is held fixed , while the integer gauge field @xmath26 , located on the dual links , is changed by @xmath85 during the updates .",
    "we have to mention that this is essentially the same procedure as the `` change - a - cube '' algorithm used in ref .",
    "the only difference for the three - dimensional model used there is that the dual potential is located on the dual sites instead of the dual links . in ref .",
    "@xcite the electromagnetic energy distribution was calculated to extract the string tension in a range of weaker couplings as total field energy per length . however",
    ", this quantity must not be confused with the string tension calculated from usual correlation functions .",
    "recently , a detailed analysis of simulating dual @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in three dimensions was performed in ref .",
    "the authors found that at weak coupling the advantages are outweighed by large autocorrelation times as the dual model becomes disordered .",
    "we also observed the increase of the autocorrelation time and correspondingly of the error for increasing values of @xmath81  with a peak at the phase transition of the four - dimensional theory . in the deconfinement phase",
    "there are large fluctuations , but the autocorrelation time is smaller than around the phase transition . since our goal is the investigation of the confinement mechanism , we take the main advantage from simulations in the confinement phase , anyhow . in this context",
    "we want to mention that we used a duality transformation exactly valid for the whole @xmath81 range , not only in the weak coupling limit as in ref .",
    "further , as stated above , the power of dual simulations lies in the inclusion of the sources in the action , which already has been realized in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for each charge distance",
    "@xmath2 a separate simulation has to be performed , and of course for the subtraction of the vacuum expectation value in ( [ correlation ] ) a distinct run is needed .",
    "therefore one gets a good estimate of the reliability of the errorbars . for smaller distances on a @xmath86 lattice",
    "an accurate comparison was performed between expectation values from ordinary and from dual simulations @xcite .",
    "the only difference in the observed results is the effect of the periodic boundary conditions which is absent in the dual model : there can be no electric flux over the period per construction . for @xmath87",
    "the dual simulation is clearly more efficient , because in ordinary simulations the signal decreases exponentially with the charge distance @xmath2 , while in the dual simulation it stays constant ( the necessary amount of computer time still depends of course on the lattice size used ) .    for the updating procedure we use a standard metropolis algorithm , which has proven sufficient for the investigated range of couplings , although a nonlocal cluster algorithm would certainly lead to a further increase in performance .",
    "our typical measurements are taken from @xmath88 configurations , where each 10th configuration is evaluated .",
    "for determining the errorbars we took blocks of 100 evaluated configurations .",
    "for the results shown in the next sections we used the coupling @xmath89 , where the system is clearly in the confinement phase . on the other hand the fluctuations in the dual theory are already large enough to produce a flux tube of the desired transverse extent .",
    "if one likes to compare with the qcd flux tube , we can require that our string tension equals the physical value , which gives a lattice spacing @xmath90 of roughly @xmath91 .",
    "we present now our numerical results for the electric field and magnetic current distribution in the presence of a static charge pair . the great advantage compared to the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is that we are now able to investigate much larger charge distances and much lower temperatures .    before discussing the temperature dependence of the flux tube profile ,",
    "let us comment on the necessary spatial size of the lattice .",
    "there is the simple condition that the spatial extent of the lattice has to be greater than the extent of the considered flux tube both in longitudinal and in transverse direction in order to prevent strong finite size effects . for our simulations we used a spatial extent of @xmath92 for charge distances @xmath93 , @xmath94 for simulating @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "further we performed some simulations on larger lattices ; the largest investigated charge distance was @xmath98 ( on a @xmath99 lattice ) .",
    "results for this distance are displayed in a 3d - plot in fig .",
    "[ plot3d ] .",
    "we focus on the longitudinal component of the electric field strength and on the azimuthal component of the magnetic current which encircles the flux tube like a coil .",
    "it can already be seen in these plots that a flux tube of constant thickness is not observed even for this large charge distance .",
    "the increase of the flux tube width with the distance between charges may be explained by roughening effects and will be discussed in section [ wsq ] .",
    "the right figure demonstrates that the signal for the magnetic current drops in the middle between charges , its radial dependence in the symmetry plane exhibits a maximum at finite @xmath100 .",
    "this behaviour is interesting for the dual superconductor interpretation as will be discussed in the next section .    in all our simulations",
    "we represent static charges by polyakov loops and therefore have to deal with finite temperature effects due to the finite time extent of the lattice .",
    "it is therefore important to separate the occuring thermal fluctuations from quantum fluctuations which are essential for the extended flux tube .",
    "this is achieved by analyzing the dependence of the results on the time extent nt , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ e_nt ] for the electric field profile and in fig .",
    "[ j_nt ] for the magnetic current profile in the symmetry plane between charges for various charge distances @xmath2 . from the results",
    "we conclude that if the time extent nt of the lattice exceeds the charge distance @xmath2 finite temperature effects can safely be neglected . for smaller",
    "nt , however , we realize a significant widening of the flux tube , connected with a decreasing magnetic current . from the point of view of the dual simulation , this widening can easily be explained .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the world sheet of the string correspond to cube - like excitations on the original lattice . at finite temperature",
    "there also appear time - independent excitations which wrap around the lattice in time direction and therefore increase the effective flux tube width .",
    "these excitations vanish if nt is large compared to the length of the flux tube .",
    "after the discussion of the techniques used for the simulation of long flux tubes and the dependence of the results on the temperature , we will now turn again to the dual superconductor interpretation .",
    "in the presence of a pair of static charges , the classical solution of the higgs model ( [ higgs ] ) yields an electric field and a magnetic current distribution according to @xmath101where the ( straight ) string @xmath102 connects the point charges , carrying a quantum of electric flux @xmath103 . integrating eq .",

    "for an infinitely long string eq .",

    "( [ fluxoid ] ) yield an electric field profile of the form @xmath104 .",
    "these classical equations were used in ref .",
    "@xcite for comparison with the results of @xmath0 lattice simulations .",
    "the free parameter @xmath105 ( the london penetration length ) could be fitted by comparing @xmath106 and @xmath107 off axis , and also the fluxoid quantisation was verified .",
    "an extension of this analysis was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by including fluctuations of the string @xmath102 in the above model .",
    "further the effective model was solved numerically on a lattice of same size , to avoid being misled by lattice artifacts . due to the exponential falloff of the signal , however , the @xmath0 data analyzed so far contain only charge distances up to @xmath108 .",
    "we will now consider the data obtained in the dual simulations , in order to see if the above interpretation holds for longer flux tubes .    in the classical model with a straight string @xmath102 one would expect that    * the flux tube width as a function of @xmath2 soon approaches a constant , this means that the fitted parameter @xmath105 should not depend on @xmath2 , * @xmath65 is constant everywhere off axis , * the azimuthal magnetic current encircling the axis should exhibit a maximum in the symmetry plane between the charges , and not near the charges . the radial dependence should exhibit an exponential falloff .",
    "it was shown that these requirements are not even fulfilled for a charge distance @xmath108 @xcite , nevertheless the flux tube profile in the symmetry plane may be described well by the effective model with a static string @xcite . considering larger charge distances",
    "confirms the discrepancy to the items mentioned above . in a comparison of electric field profiles for @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( see fig .",
    "[ e_mod ] ) it can be seen that the fitted values for @xmath105 not only differ very much , but it is already impossible to describe the field distribution for larger charge distances by the numerical solution of coupled maxwell and london equation .    for the magnetic current distribution we already see in fig .",
    "[ plot3d ] and in fig .",
    "[ j_nt ] that its behaviour can not be explained in the above effective model .",
    "[ jm_mod ] shows the corresponding classical solutions , again for @xmath108 and @xmath109 . for larger distances ,",
    "there is not even qualitative agreement : the azimuthal component of the magnetic current as a function of the transverse distance first increases and takes its maximum value at @xmath110 .",
    "this phenomenon together with the other described observations may be explained within the dual superconductor picture by two different approaches : first , it can be regarded as evidence for the importance of string fluctuations .",
    "this way was chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the intrinsic thickness of the flux tube @xmath105 turned out to be much smaller than the effective flux tube width which increases with charge distance .",
    "the extreme scenario ( @xmath111 ) leads us again to the exact correspondence of @xmath0 to the @xmath79 limit of a dual higgs model .",
    "the second possibility for arguing is to stay in the classical model of a dual superconductor , but leave the london ( extreme type ii ) limit described so far .",
    "a strong suppression of the higgs condensate in the region of electric fields may also lead to the behaviour of the current observed in fig .",
    "[ jm_mod ] .",
    "a similar current distribution measured in abelian projection of @xmath112 was interpreted in this way in ref .",
    "hence , one may conclude that @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in this respect behaves like a dual type - i superconductor .",
    "stronger evidence for such a statement is expected of course from an investigation of the interaction between flux tubes ( which also can be performed very efficiently in a dual simulation ) .",
    "indeed preliminary results @xcite show an attraction between @xmath0 flux tubes for the regarded value of @xmath81 .",
    "we may conclude that interpreting the flux tube results in terms of the dual superconductor picture still makes sense , but @xmath0 lattice gauge theory certainly can not be regarded as a classical dual superconductor in the london limit if one examines larger charge distances . on the other hand",
    "the effective string description of flux tubes represents an independent feature of the lattice gauge system , and from the point of view of dual simulations this looks somehow easier to argue .",
    "we will use this approach in the next section for a closer look at the flux tube width in dependence of the charge distance .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the string model approximation to wilson loop correlation functions was used to study the behaviour of the flux tube width for large charge distances .",
    "this model assumes a very thin bare flux tube subjected to quantum mechanical fluctuations . a convenient measure for the transverse extent of the flux tube is the squared width @xmath113 where @xmath114 represents a quantity characteristic of the flux tube , for example the ( chromo-)electric field energy density .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the squared width @xmath115 diverges logarithmically for @xmath116 , @xmath117 with some constants @xmath118 and @xmath119 . a numerical test of this hypothesis could not be performed up to now for @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . in the three - dimensional @xmath120 gauge model",
    "this prediction was verified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors also exploited the duality relation to a three - dimensional ising model and combined their data with high precision data on the interface physics of the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "they also achieved agreement with the prediction @xmath121 ( where @xmath122 is the string tension ) for the two - dimensional free gaussian model .",
    "there is the conjecture that this behaviour of the flux tube width should be observed in all gauge theories .",
    "it is therefore interesting to test this prediction in dual @xmath0 simulations where large flux tubes become accessible .",
    "we determine the flux tube width by means of the parallel component of the electric field strength @xmath123 .",
    "our defintion on the lattice reads : @xmath124 this slightly reduces the estimated error compared to the definition via the electric field energy , in all other aspects the results roughly agree .",
    "the sum extends over a transverse plane of the lattice with @xmath125 : for @xmath126 we evaluate the sum until a transverse distance @xmath127 , for larger distances we use @xmath128 . in fig .",
    "[ w_nt ] one can see again the influence of finite temperature effects on the flux tube width .",
    "the calculation with time extent 16 can be taken as acceptable approximation to the zero temperature case for the regarded charge distances and is analyzed according to the prediction ( [ wlog ] ) in fig .",

    "there are no string fluctuations , and therefore only the parallel component of the electric field contributes . if we consider single cube - like excitations in transverse directions , we get also contributions from transverse electric and transverse magnetic fields . in this case",
    "they cancel each other exactly and therefore do not change the total energy . for stronger fluctuations , i.  e.  increasing roughening of the string , these components differ , and also the parallel magnetic component gets nonzero .",
    "the results for @xmath89 are plotted in fig .",
    "one can argue that for charge distances @xmath135 the string fluctuations are not fully developped .",
    "the `` coulomb '' behaviour of the total field energy observed in fig .",
    "[ en_16_4 ] is mainly due to the parallel component of the magnetic field which gives the smallest contribution to the linear increase of the energy .",
    "this demonstrates that the behaviour of the flux tube can not be explained easily within a classical static model .",
    "our motivation was a detailed quantitative analysis of the dual superconductor picture in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . by considering the duality transformation of correlation functions we improved the understanding of the behaviour of expectation values of fields and currents in the presence of a charge pair , as well as the significance of string fluctuations .",
    "moreover , simulating the dually transformed theory provided numerical flux tube data for low temperatures and large charge distances not obtained before in four - dimensional @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "we found that finite temperature effects may be neglected for time extents exceeding the charge distance , while for smaller time extents the flux tube widens significantly .",
    "further we examined the electric field and magnetic current distribution and found that its description by the classical solution of maxwell and london equation fails for large charge distances .",
    "the observed effects may be explained by fluctuations of the flux tube , on the other hand the current profile resembles that of a dual type - i superconductor .",
    "roughening effects which become important for large distances are described well by the effective string picture of confinement which predicts a logarithmic increase of the flux tube width .",
    "finally , the analysis of the total field energy revealed the responsibility of the parallel magnetic field for the coulomb behaviour at small distances .    at this time , no final statement should be made which effective model is really able to describe strongly coupled @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "certain aspects of the flux tube may be explained by a `` classical '' dual superconductor picture , while others can not .",
    "further studies considering periodically closed flux tubes ( torelons ) are in progress and promise to answer some of the remaining questions .",
    "we want to thank richard w.  haymaker for interesting discussions on the description of confinement in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory by effective models .",
    "further we thank jeff greensite for making us aware of an article ( formerly not known to us ) , where the energy density in three - dimensional @xmath0 was calculated in an analogous way .",
    "finally we acknowledge critical comments from andrei ivanov and tefan olejnk .",
