    "it has been already studied that results from the canonical and grand canonical models converge more as the fragmenting system becomes more symmetric as the particle fluctuation in grand canonical model becomes less in such cases .",

    "results from the canonical ensemble ( which is more suitable for describing finite nculei with conserved mass and charge ) deviate from these equations and this deviation is more pronounced for smaller source size and more asymmtetric nuclei .",
