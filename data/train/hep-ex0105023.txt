    "atmospheric neutrino are produced as decay products in hadronic showers resulting from collisions of cosmic - rays with nuclei in the upper atmosphere .",
    "production of electron and muon neutrino is dominated by the processes @xmath3 followed by @xmath4 that gives an expected ratio of the flux of @xmath5 to the flux of @xmath6 of about 2 .",
    "vertically downward - going neutrinos travel about 15 km while vertically upward - going neutrinos travel about 13,000 km before interacting in the detector .",

    "the oscillation probability between two neutrino flavors is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mixing angle , @xmath9 is the flight length of the neutrino , @xmath10 is the neutrino energy , @xmath11 is the mass squared difference . the range of energy of observable atmospheric neutrino is from a few hundred mev to the order of 100gev . the broad energy spectrum and flight distances makes measurement of atmospheric neutrino sensitive to neutrino oscillation with @xmath12 down to the order of @xmath13 .",

    "the fiducial mass of the detector for atmospheric neutrino analysis is 22.5 kiloton .",
    "neutrino events interacting with the water are observed as fully - contained ( fc ) or partially - contained ( pc ) events according to the amount of anti - counter activity .",
