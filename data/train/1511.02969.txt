    "it is often useful in the visual arts to depict a scene composed within a very wide angle of view . for scenes that are wide but not tall ( lanscapes ) one can project on a cylinder and then unfold this developable surface isometrically onto a plane to get the so - called cylindrical or panoramic perspective .",
    "when the scene is wide all around an axis , it can be projected onto a half - sphere and then deformed onto a disc on the plane .",
    "this is the so - called spherical perspective , and has been described thoroughly in @xcite in the 1960s .",
    "it is in fact a hemi - spherical perspective , that allows a depiction of up to 180 degrees around an axis , wherein images of lines can be easily constructed with ruler and compass within a reasonable approximation .",
    "it is often useful , however , to depict an even wider scene .",
    "the author , having taught a course in art and mathematics for a few years to a varied audience ( urban sketchers , architects , school teachers , programmers ) has often received requests from students regarding two questions : how to plot ( either freehand or with minimal instruments ) a view wider than the @xmath0 allowed by ( hemi)spherical perspective , and how to draw a sphere reflection .",
    "this paper solves the former question and relates it to the latter .",
    "it also hopes to help clarify some concepts of anamorphosis and perspective .",
    "in their 1968 work , barre and flocon @xcite described a ruler and compass method to plot a 180 degrees spherical perspective .",
    "this was a work with a focus on the artistic practice of actual freehand drawing . since then several works of a computational nature have proposed various types of wide angle perspectives , by expanding the angle of view up to 360 degrees or by generalizing the shapes of the projection surfaces ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these works are of a computational nature and not concerned with the artistic practice of freehand or ruler and compass drawing . as far as this author",
    "can tell , there has been no publication wherein a system is proposed to allow a depiction of a 360 degree spherical perspective in a way adequate for drawing from observation or from orthogonal plans with the use of minimal equipment such as ruler and compass .",
    "regarding contributions by artists themselves , dick thermes is well - known for his paintings on spherical surfaces .",
    "he has published a book @xcite on the subject .",
    "his approach is based on gridding in the manner that follows from @xcite . his solution to go beyong the 180 degrees",
    "is simply to draw the two complementary 180 degree views separately and place them adjacently to each other .",
    "when drawing on a sphere he can put each view on on its hemisphere , but that is a work of anamorphosis and not of perspective proper .    the most common artistic device for representating views beyond 180 degrees",
    "is that of drawing sphere reflections from observation , and we will consider the relation of these with spherical perspective .    in @xcite sphere reflections have been proposed as way to obtain a wide field of view ( with difficulties that we will discuss ahead ) .",
    "again this is a work of a computational nature .",
    "perspectives are ways of representing spatial scenes on a plane , with relation to an observer .    we take a _ scene _ to mean any subset of the euclidean 3-dimensional space .",
    "we represent an _ observer _ by a point in 3-space , usually denoted by @xmath1 . _ _ _ _    our purpose is to map each point of a scene in 3-space onto a point on a plane , the latter point being called the perspective image of the former .",
    "mostly we will be concerned with sets of points , lines , planes , or circles , and will use these to approximate more complicated objects .",
    "a map from @xmath2 to @xmath3 that fails to project these elementary objects with simplicity is not adequate for the purposes of a perspective to be used `` by hand '' .",
    "all the maps that are usually called perspectives ( plane , cylindrical , spherical ) can be constructed as particular cases of a same scheme that we will now describe .",
    "let @xmath1 be an observer and @xmath4 a point in a scene .",
    "we call the ray @xmath5 the _ ray of sight _ from @xmath1 to @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the unit sphere centered at @xmath1 .",
    "we call @xmath7 the _ direction of sight _ from @xmath1 to @xmath4 .",
    "points will be equivalent if they are radial from @xmath1 .",
    "these equivalence classes are naturally formalized into points of the projective space in classical perspective . for more general perspectives",
    ", however we have to take into account the need to represent both a direction and its diametrically opposite , hence the sphere is the natural manifold of directions . ] _ _ _ _    a point @xmath4 in a scene will define a vector @xmath5 and a ray with the same notation",
    ". we will let the ambiguity stand and let context distinguish them .",
    "the unit vector @xmath8 on the sphere can be seen as the equivalence class of all the points that have it s direction of sight from @xmath1 , i.e. , all the points in the ray of sight @xmath5 .",
    "now recall a few generalities about circles on spheres :    a _ great circle _ is a circle on a sphere , defined by the intersection of the sphere with a plane through the origin . _ _    given a point p on the sphere we call _ antipode point _ of p to the its diametrically opposite point on the sphere .",
    "_ _    each point @xmath4 on the sphere defines a family of great circles that covers the sphere , all of those circles crossing both @xmath4 and its antipode .",
    "each two non - antipodal points @xmath4 and @xmath9 on the sphere define a unique great circle , the intersection of the sphere with the plane @xmath10 .",
    "a _ meridian _ is one contiguous half of a great circle .",
    "given a point @xmath4 and its antipode @xmath11 we will call @xmath4-meridian or @xmath12-meridian to a meridian that is an arc of a great circle whose endpoints are at @xmath4 and at its antipode . _ _",
    "we are now ready to consider the problem of vanishing points .    [ missing ]",
    "let @xmath13 be a line not crossing @xmath1 .",
    "there is a single plane @xmath14 through @xmath1 containing @xmath13 .",
    "this plane projects radially into a great circle @xmath15 on the sphere .",
    "the set of rays of sight of @xmath13 will form a cone , the set @xmath16 which is a half - plane contained in @xmath14 .",
    "the boundary of this half - plane is the line @xmath17 , the translation of @xmath13 to the origin .",
    "this line corresponds to two rays from @xmath1 none of which is a ray of sight of an actual point of @xmath13 but correspond to the limit of the directions of sight of an observer that follows the line to infinity in both directions .",
    "the intersection of @xmath18 with the sphere is the set of directions of sight of @xmath13 .",
    "it is half of the great circle @xmath15 , and it does not contain the two antipodal endpoints , which are the intersection of @xmath17 with the sphere .    the two missing directions in example [ missing ] correspond to the intuitive notion of vanishing point .",
    "as the eye follows a line @xmath19 to infinity , the ray of sight will in the limit become parallel to the line it follows .",
    "this will happen at both ends of the line @xmath19 .",
    "but since this happens for no actual point on the line , the projection of the line @xmath19 on the sphere of directions will be missing two points at its end .",
    "such missing points , for lines or more complex sets , can be added to the cone of directions by taking the topological closure .",
    "let @xmath20 be a scene .",
    "let @xmath1 be an observer .",
    "let @xmath21 be the topological closure of @xmath20 .",
    "the rays of sight of the points of @xmath21 define a cone @xmath22 with vertex at @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the closure of the intersection of this cone with the unit sphere @xmath6 .",
    "we call @xmath24 the _ cone of sight _ of @xmath20 relative to @xmath1",
    ". we will abuse the term to also mean the corresponding cone of rays in 3-space stemming from @xmath1 that project radially to @xmath24 , and we will denote that cone of rays by @xmath25 .",
    "_ _    taking the topological closure of the cone of sight allows us to obtain its vanishing points in the following definition .",
    "note that we took the closure of @xmath20 in order to avoid the appearance of `` false '' vanishing points . in what follows",
    "we will always assume the scenes to be closed sets , so this step may be ignored .",
    "we call _ vanishing points _ of a scene @xmath20 to the set @xmath26 . _",
    "_    that is , vanishing points are the frontier points of the cone of directions that are not directions of actual points in ( the closure of ) the scene .",
    "going back to example [ missing ] we take the closure of the half circle and obtain its two endpoints .",
    "we see that the set of vanishing points of a line @xmath13 is the intersection of its translation to the origin , @xmath17 , with the sphere of directions .",
    "the cone of sight of @xmath13 is one half of the great circle of @xmath14 , including its end points .",
    "the corresponding cone of rays is the half - plane of h plus the set of two diametrically opposite rays passing through the vanishing points .",
    "let @xmath14 be a plane not passing through @xmath1 .",
    "the cone of rays of the individual points of @xmath14 forms a half - space whose frontier is a plane parallel to @xmath14 passing through @xmath1 .",
    "this frontier is not contained in the set of rays of sight of individual points of @xmath14 .",
    "it is however contained in the closure of that set . on the sphere ,",
    "the cone of sight will be a hemisphere and the set of vanishing points will be the great circle that forms its boundary .",
    "( in classical perspective the visible part of this circle will form a line , called a vanishing line . )",
    "we say that a surface @xmath27 is radial with respect to a point @xmath1 if any ray stemming from @xmath1 will hit the surface on at most on point .",
    "we will say that a surface is radial if the point @xmath1 is obvious from context .    a _ perspective",
    "_ is a map from euclidean 3-space to a region of the plane , that is achieved by the composition of two maps .",
    "the first we call an _ anamorphism _ and the second a _ flattening _ . _ _ _ _ _ _    given an observer @xmath1 , a surface @xmath27 that is radial for @xmath1 , and a scene @xmath28 , we say that @xmath29 is the _ anamorphosis _ ( or _ anamorphic image _ ) of @xmath28 on @xmath27 relative to @xmath1 . to the map that takes each point to its anamorphic image we call the anamorphism onto @xmath27 relative to @xmath1 . is an image painted on @xmath27 such that the observer at @xmath1 would mistake that image for the spatial scene itself .",
    "we should notice here that we are using the word in two senses : there is `` anamorphosis '' as the problem of tromp loeil , and there is anamorphosis as the mathematical construction we just defined .",
    "that the latter is the solution of the former can not be demonstrated mathematically ; it is an empirical fact that depends on the approximate validity of linear optics and on the physiology vision . ] . _ _ _ _    a _ flattening _ is a map from @xmath27 to a region of the plane @xmath3 .",
    "it takes the anamorphosis of a scene to its perspective image . _ _",
    "a perspective is a map @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an anamorphosis and @xmath32 is a flattening .",
    "we note that the anamorphism is fully defined by the choice of surface @xmath27 and observer @xmath1 .",
    "the map itself is just the conical projection from @xmath1 onto that surface .    in classical perspective",
    "the anamorphic surface is a plane and the flattening can be seen as the identity map up to scaling .",
    "lines will project onto lines , but for each line only at most one of the vanishing points will be present in the perspective image .",
    "lines that are parallel to the anamorphic plane will have no vanishing points at all in their perspective image .",
    "in cilyndrical perspective , @xmath27 is a cylinder with @xmath1 on the axis , and the flattening consists in unrolling the cylinder over a plane .",
    "the anamorphic images of straight lines will be arcs of ellipses and the flattening will unroll them onto sinusoids .",
    "the pairs of vanishing points of lines on the sphere of directions will project onto the cylinder except if their directions are along the axis of the cylinder",
    ".    in the the so - called spherical perspective of @xcite @xmath27 is a hemisphere of a sphere around @xmath1 and the flattening is a restriction to a hemisphere of the azimuthal equidistant projection .",
    "lines will project onto arcs of great circle on the hemisphere , and will have one vanishing point on both the anamorphic image and the perspective image ; or two points if these are on the equator .    in the the full spherical perspective considered ahead",
    "@xmath27 is a sphere around @xmath1 and the flattening is the azimuthal equidistant projection .",
    "lines will project onto halves of great circle on the sphere , and will have always two vanishing points on the anamorphic image . because the anamorphic surface is a sphere , just like the sphere of directions , the anamorphism is a homothety , and can be identified with the identity map .",
    "we note an interesting symmetry between spherical and plane perspective . in classical perspective",
    "the flattening is trivial but the anamorphosis is not .",
    "in spherical perspective the reverse is true .",
    "this is because in classical perspective the plane of the anamorphosis can be identified with the plane of the perspective , while in the spherical perspective the anamorphic sphere can be identified with the sphere of directions , so the flattening in the former case and the anamorphosis in the latter can be identified with the identity map .",
    "we have not placed any constraints on the nature of @xmath27 or on the maps .",
    "the fact is that in artistic practice there are examples where the surface @xmath27 in anything from a set of disconnected planes to a myriad of dust - like particles in suspension .",
    "@xmath27 is certainly not a necessarily a smooth , nor a connected surface , although it is so in all the usual perspectives such as the one we treat here .",
    "we will now define our spherical perspective , within the general scheme outlined above .",
    "first we must define the anamorphic surface and the place of our observer .",
    "we will take @xmath27 to be a spherical surface of arbitrary positive radius @xmath33 , with the observer @xmath1 at its center .",
    "choosing these elements fully defines our anamorphism .",
    "what can we say about it ?    as we already discussed , the anamorphic sphere being a surface , the anamorphic image coincides with the cone of sight in the sphere of directions .",
    "hence the anamorphosis of a line @xmath13 onto a sphere relative to its center is an arc of a great circle : the rays of sight from @xmath1 to the points of the line @xmath13 define ( half of ) a plane that crosses @xmath1 .",
    "the anamorphic image of that plane is a great circle , and the image of the line is a half of the great circle , delimited by two vanishing points , determined thus :    if @xmath19 is a line , and @xmath34 is the translation of line @xmath19 that passes through @xmath1 , then the vanishing points of @xmath19 are the intersection of @xmath34 with @xmath27 .",
    "we will now define our flattening map .",
    "we must first define a system of coordinates .",
    "we consider a ray stemming from @xmath1 , representing a privileged direction of sight .",
    "we call it the _ central ray of sight _ and to its axis we call the _ central axis of sight _ .",
    "we place an orthonormal reference frame @xmath35 in @xmath1 , such that the positive side of the @xmath36 axis coincides with the central ray of sight . for quick reference",
    "we name the points where the three axes cut the sphere : we call * * n**orth to the intersection of the central ray of sight with the sphere and * * s**outh to its antipode point ; * * e**ast to the point where the @xmath37 axis touches the sphere and * * w**est to it s antipode ; * * z**enith to the point where the positive @xmath38 axis touches the sphere and na**d**ir to its antipode , and we represent these points by the letters that we wrote in bold . _ _ _ _    we call the plane orthogonal to the central axis of sight ( the xz - plane ) the _ observer s plane _ ; we call the @xmath39-plane the _ sagital plane _ .",
    "the observer s plane intersects the sphere in a great circle we call the _ equator _ . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _    we call the half - space @xmath40 the anterior half - space ( representing everything in front of the observer ) and to the half - space @xmath41 we call the posterior half - space ( representing all that is behind the observer ) .",
    "we construct a flattening map that will project all the points of the sphere onto a disc on a plane , with the exception of the south pole .",
    "this map composed with the anamorphosis will result in a perspective that images all points of 3-space except those points located on the @xmath42 ray .",
    "we define the flattening thus :    we map the sphere minus its south pole one - to - one to a disc on the plane in such a way that each north - south meridian goes to a line segment and    \\i ) distances are preserved along each meridian .",

    "condition i ) means that the map is an isometry for each meridian separately .",
    "since distances measured along great circles of the sphere are proportional to angles from the center , this means that if @xmath44 are points on the same meridian and if @xmath45 are their images , then @xmath46 up to multiplication by a scale factor to mean that these equalities are valid modulo product by the adequate scale factors . ] .",
    "condition i ) also implies that @xmath43 will be mapped to the center of the disc with the segments corresponding to the meridians radiating from it .",
    "the lines stemming from the image of @xmath43 we will call measuring lines , because angular distances are preserved along them",
    ". they will be the essential tool for our plotting of points .",
    "condition ii ) means that the angles between measuring lines at the image of @xmath43 will be equal to the angles of their meridians at @xmath43 ( which are the angles between the planes that define them ) .",
    "it ensures the meridians will be distributed radially preserving their tangents on @xmath43 , that is , they will look as if orthogonally dropped onto the tangent plane to the sphere at @xmath43 .",
    "we call _ longitude _ of an n - meridian to the angle between its tangent and that of the east meridian at point @xmath43",
    ". the longitude of a meridian will equal the angle of its measuring line with the @xmath47 measuring line .",
    "_ _    condition i ) and ii ) together imply that the two meridians of each great circle through @xmath43 form a diameter of the perspective disc and that distances are preserved along interior points of these diameters .    in intuitive terms , we look at the north - south meridians as inextensible threads , connected to the sphere on the north and south poles .",
    "we cut them free at the south pole only , and , pulling them straight along their tangents at @xmath43 , make from them a disc on the plane tangent to the sphere at @xmath43 .",
    "at the end , the threads are radiating from @xmath43 , each under the orthogonal shadow of its former position , so that the angles their tangents make at @xmath43 are the same as before .",
    "distances have not changed between points on the same thread .",
    "the threads together form a disc of radius @xmath48 , where @xmath33 is the radius of the sphere , with @xmath43 at the center and each point of the sphere corresponds to a single point on the disc , except for the south pole , that was blown - up and is missing from the outer edge of each thread , hence making the disc open at its boundary .",
    "we take the closure of the disc and get a frontier circle which we call the south circle , or the blow - up of the south pole , each of whose points corresponds to one of the directions that the original pole could be apporached from ( each of them can be identified with one of the meridians , or with a ray of the tangent plane at @xmath27 ) .",
    "when context is clear we will use the same letters for the @xmath49 points and their images , and will call equator to the perspective image of the equator . see fig .",
    "[ disc360 ] for a picture of the perspective image of these points and lines .",
    "points in the anterior half - space will be projected by the anamorphosis into the hemisphere in front of the equator , and these will be flattened in turn onto the inner part of the perspective disc that is contained within the image of the equator .",
    "this inner disc will have half of the radius of the perspective disc .",
    "the posterior half space will be projected onto the outer ring between the image of the equator and the circle of the blow - up of the south pole @xmath27",

    "the natural set of spherical coordinates for this map is @xmath57 where    @xmath58    that is , @xmath59 is the latitude and @xmath60 is the longitude with respect to the north pole . in these coordinates    @xmath61    we see that the perspective map does not in fact depend on the norm @xmath62 of the point , which is to be expected since the anamorphosis is a central projection .    , height=340 ]",
    "_ solving a scene _ in perspective means finding the perspective images of all points on the scene - classically , and in the interest of solving a scene with simple instruments , we are concerned with the images of points grouped into lines , and especially with their vanishing points .",
    "we will now show how to solve a scene in our 360 degree spherical perspective using ruler and compass . _ _    a common technique to solve scenes in classical perspective is to make the plane of the perspective image do double or triple duty by superposing on various orthogonal projections .",

    "note that this is exactly the same construction as in classical perspective , though with a different interpretation .    to plot the frontal lines we first trace a line @xmath19 on the plane of the grid , such that it makes a 45 degree angle to the right of the observer and crosses the nadir point .",
    "this line will cross each row of squares , touching a vertex of each row .",
    "we plot the great circle @xmath15 of the plane defined by @xmath1 and @xmath19 .",
    "first we plot the anterior part by drawing the arc @xmath156 where @xmath119 is the 45 degree vanishing point on the horizontal axis .",
    "then we note that each of the receding lines @xmath155 crosses a vertex of the grid where it touches the anterior part of the 45-degree line . to find these points we intersect each @xmath155 with the upper half of @xmath15 on the anterior disc and take the antipodal point of that intersection .",
    "since this point will be on the posterior space and will belong to @xmath19 and to @xmath155 , then it will be the required vertex .",
    "so we can plot a posterior horizontal line through it to get a posterior planar line of the grid .",
    "note that we have used the receding lines of the grid as the natural measuring lines to construct the posterior fat line of @xmath19 . in this fashion we can plot the full 360 degree grid to any required precision and extension .    in fig .",
    "[ room45 ] we represent a tiled cubic room drawn from the point of view of an observer at its center , looking straight into the center of one of the walls .",
    "the whole setup is drawn very simply from a judicious use of vertical and horizontal frontal lines at 45 degrees to the observer ; these lines do double duty , as , for instance , the frontal vertical at 45 degrees to the right of the observer has the same projection as the line on the plane of the horizon that goes from the nadir to the 45 degree mark on the @xmath153 measuring line .",

    "we find the perspective images of the points @xmath162 . from this square",
    "we can plot a grid by an adaptation of the previous methods .",
    "it is apparent from the plot of the 45 degree room in fig [ room45 ] that our perspective bears striking resemblances to a reflection on a sphere .",
    "it is natural to ask if it is indeed a reflection .",
    "recall how a reflection works ( see fig [ obstruction ] ) : an observer at point @xmath163 will see a point @xmath4 reflected at a point @xmath33 on the sphere according to these rules : @xmath33 will be on the intersection of the sphere with the plane @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( angle of incidence equals angle of reflection ) .",
    "we notice several difficulties . given @xmath33 , it is easy to find the incident and reflected rays , but the inverse problem of obtaining @xmath33 from @xmath4 is non - trivial . in general",
    "it requires solving an algebraic equation of order four ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also , obstructions are non - trivial . in fig .",
    "[ obstruction ] we can see that points @xmath4 and @xmath9 will have the same reflection @xmath33 even though they are not in the same ray from either the center @xmath1 or the observer @xmath163 . by contrast , obstructions are always radial for perspectives , being fully determined before the flattening , at the step of the anamorphosis .    finally , our spherical perspective has an angle of view of @xmath77 .",
    "the angle of view captured by a reflection depends on the distance of the observer to the sphere .",
    "the points of the sphere define a cone with the observer @xmath163 at the vertex , the cone of shadow , and every point outside of this cone of shadow will be viewable on the sphere . in angular terms , the field of view will be @xmath166 with @xmath167 , where @xmath19 is the radius of the sphere and @xmath168 the distance of the observer from the center of the sphere .",
    "there is however a limiting case wherein these problems disappear .",
    "there are two ways of making @xmath169 go to zero : you can move away from the sphere ( and look at it from a telescope to compensate ) or stay put and shrink it ( and look at it with a microscope ) , or some combination of the two that will make the @xmath19 negligible small compared to @xmath168 .",
    "either way will , in the limit , make for a @xmath77 angle of view ( the first option will leave a tubular shadow of finite section , however , while the second will reduce the shadow to a ray ) .    in any case , in the limit @xmath170 , the rays coming from the observer @xmath163 to the sphere with center @xmath1 become parallel to @xmath171 , and the angle of reflexion @xmath172 becomes equal to the angle @xmath173 .",
    "hence @xmath174 ( see fig . [ parallelreflection ] ) .",
    "still , the position of @xmath4 is not determined by @xmath175 but by the angle @xmath59 of fig .",
    "[ obstruction ] .",
    "we can however make these angles equal by either restricting the reflection to objects at infinte distance ( say , plotting a reflection of the celestial sphere ) or by making @xmath19 go to zero .",
    "when @xmath19 goes to zero , @xmath33 goes to @xmath1 and @xmath59 becomes @xmath176 .",
    "in that limit , the projection becomes radial ( therefore making obstructions trivial ) , and the whole space of directions is mapped onto the hemisphere visible from @xmath163 .",
    "this can be seen as a sphere anamorphosis followed by a linear contraction onto a hemisphere by halving the angle @xmath59 of each point on the sphere .",
    "seen from point @xmath163 , since all rays are parallel to the axis @xmath177 , the reflection will look like the orthogonal projection along @xmath177 of the image on the sphere .",
    "hence the reflection , seen from @xmath163 , is anamorphically equivalent to a perspective obtained by the trivial anamorphism onto the sphere composed with a flattening which is the composition of a linear compression onto a hemisphere followed by an orthogonal projection . in the spherical coordinates of [ natcoords ] ( with the @xmath36 axis on @xmath178 and @xmath179 in the perpendicular plane through @xmath1 ) and rescaling the sphere to @xmath180 ,",
    "this perspective is the map    @xmath181    where the first map is the trivial anamorphosis , the second is the crunching into the hemisphere and the last step is the orthogonal projection .",
    "this is a 360 degree perspective , but different from our spherical perspective .",
    "it is not linear along @xmath59 , squashing the outer angles more , and can not be easily used for drawing by hand without the help of pre - computed grids ( since we lose the isometry along measuring lines ) .",
    "but we can see why there is a qualitative similarity between the two",
    ".     becomes equal to @xmath172 .",
    "if p goes to infinity then @xmath59 goes to @xmath172.,width=264 ]    it has been noted in @xcite that reflections on a sphere could be used as a form of wide angle `` perspective '' .",
    "this is well inspired in art history , in fact , as reflections drawn from observation have been the time honoured tool of the artist to represent a wide angle of view , escher s self portrait being a well known example .",
    "we have already seen the difficulties in this approach .",
    "first , reflections are hard to calculate .",
    "second , they are not perspectives in our sense of the word ( i.e. , `` radial '' perspectives ) , and they have non - trivial obstructions .",
    "as noted in @xcite this causes difficulties for hidden - face removal algorithms .",
    "if the purpose is to represent a wide angle view , spherical perspective is a much more natural proposal .",
    "it allows for ( up to ) a 360 degree view ; it is a perspective in the sense we defined above and therefore , like all such perspectives , has trivial obstructions , with hidden - face algorithms working exactly as in the classical case , being calculated at the anamorphosis step .",
    "furthermore , spherical perspective is easy to calculate by map [ exactxyz ] and , unlike the limiting case of reflections mentioned above , it can actually be used by an artist armed only with ruler and compass or even , after some practice , in freehand drawing from nature .",
