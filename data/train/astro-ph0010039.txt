    "in theories of hierarchical structure formation the class of objects most recently formed holds a special significance .",
    "observationally this class of objects is clusters of galaxies  the largest virialized structures in the present day universe .",
    "the local abundance of rich clusters of galaxies provides a strong constraint on the fluctuations in the matter density on scales of order 10mpc @xcite .",
    "consistency with this constraint is one of the most important tests a model can pass , since the constraint is directly on the linear theory power spectrum , at a scale where there is an abundance of data . by fixing the normalization at wavelengths much smaller than those probed by _ cobe _",
    "one obtains an accurate local normalization on scales relevant to much of structure formation , a long lever arm for constraining the shape of the power spectrum , and a normalization to matter fluctuations which is independent of galaxy bias .",
    "there have been several recent and detailed studies of the cluster abundance , including bond & myers , eke , cole & frenk  , viana & liddle , colafrancesco , mazzotta & vittorio , kitayama & suto , eke et al .  , pen , wang & steinhardt , donahue & voit and henry .",
    "however , even more recently , there have been several developments in terms of both theory and observation which suggest it would be useful to revisit this constraint .",
    "firstly the addition of _ asca _  temperatures @xcite means that there is now a well defined local temperature function for clusters , with relatively small errors in temperature .",
    "secondly a number of large n - body simulations have accurately determined the mass function of virialized haloes ( e.g.  governato et al .",
    "1999 ) , finding non - negligible deviations from the old press - schechter  ( 1974 ; hereafter ps ) theory .",
    "for example the extremely large n - body simulations of the virgo consortium have highlighted systematic departures from the ps predicted mass functions @xcite , which alter the constraints on the power spectrum normalization coming from the cluster abundance .",
    "thirdly , more ambitious hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation ( e.g.  frenk et al .  1999 , and references therein )",
    "have resulted in improvements in the relationship between mass and temperature and a better estimate of its scatter .",
    "finally , the increased sophistication of multi - parameter cosmological studies ( in particular driven by recent cmb anisotropy measurements ) requires that cosmological models with general curvature be considered ( see e.g.  white & scott 1996 ) .    with these refinements",
    "our results are an improvement over other studies of the past few years .",
    "we point out explicitly where we differ from other work , and also where we think things could be further improved in the future .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we review some of the appropriate theory in  [",
    "sec : theory ] ; our local sample of clusters is presented in  [",
    "sec : data ] ; we describe our statistical method in  [ sec : stats ] ; and we present our results and conclusions in  [ sec : results ] and  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the abundance of rich clusters is tied to the normalization of the power spectrum ( extrapolated to the present using linear theory ) through the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) theory and its extensions ( see sheth , mo & tormen  2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the theory has always had a somewhat weak analytic justification , its widespread adoption arising from the dual facts that it is easy to use and provides a remarkably good fit to more computationally expensive simulations .",
    "although galaxy velocity dispersion and gravitational lensing mass estimates exist for many clusters @xcite , the direct estimation of mass through determination of the x - ray temperature is far more reliable  although the situation is certainly improving , allowing for estimates of the mass function @xcite . in the x - ray band",
    "there is considerably more high quality data on luminosity than on temperature , but there is enormous uncertainty in deriving mass @xmath8 from luminosity @xmath9 .",
    "hence our point of comparison between theory and observation will be the temperature function of rich clusters , i.e.  the number density of clusters within a temperature range @xmath10 about @xmath11 .",
    "this needs to be observationally determined over some range of @xmath11 sufficiently high that gravitational physics dominates .",
    "observational and theoretical considerations place this limit at @xmath12kev ( e.g.  finoguenov et al .",
    "2000 ; nevalainen , markevitch & forman  2000 ) .",
    "ideally we could compare the data with a temperature function estimated directly from a series of large cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( see e.g.  pen  1998 ) , which included all of the physics relevant to determining the emission weighted inter - galactic medium ( igm ) temperature of clusters .",
    "this however is currently computationally infeasible .",
    "instead we shall make use of the fact that rich clusters are large virialized structures dominated by gravity , and thus we can factorize the problem and proceed in two steps .",
    "first we shall use the abundance of dark matter haloes of a given mass drawn from extremely large n - body simulations .",
    "any dark matter halo large enough to host a cluster is unambiguously seen in such simulations .",
    "next we shall use a mass - temperature relation , calibrated from hydrodynamical simulations , to convert from the ( unobservable ) virial mass to the igm temperature , effectively using the larger volume of the n - body simulations to improve the statistics of the hydro simulations .",
    "unfortunately the mass functions determined from the n - body simulations are somewhat dependent on the method used to define haloes and their masses , and the precise definition of mass used there is not exactly what is used in the hydrodynamic simulations which calibrate the @xmath13 relation ; the difference is expected to be small however @xcite .",
    "we discuss further details of the @xmath13 relation in   [ sec : halomass ] and [ sec : mt ]",
    ".      our constraint will be on the variance of the density field , smoothed on some ( comoving ) scale @xmath14 corresponding to a mass @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the background density . in terms of the power spectrum @xmath17",
    "where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the matter power spectrum and @xmath20 is the window function corresponding to the smoothing of the density field ( see e.g.  peebles 1993 ) .",
    "our mass functions are fitted assuming a spherical top - hat smoothing , so @xmath21\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the spherical bessel function of order 1 .",
    "we are interested in both the normalization of the power spectrum , for which we shall use @xmath23 , and its shape .",
    "we use the cold dark matter family of power spectra and parameterize the shape by @xmath5 in the fitting formula of bardeen et al .",
    "while the form of eisenstein & hu  ( 1999 ) provides a slightly better fit to the shape , we will mostly quote the results in a @xmath5 independent way , rendering this distinction unimportant .",
    "we write @xmath24 where the growth factor @xmath25 can be computed numerically @xcite : @xmath26 where the scale factor @xmath27 , and the dimensionless time @xmath28 .",
    "the friedmann equation gives @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hubble constant .",
    "the usual symbols @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the density parameters ( @xmath34 , with @xmath35 ) in matter , cosmological constant and curvature , respectively .",
    "photons and other relativistic species can be safely ignored .      within the ps theory and its extensions the ( comoving ) number density of objects of ( virial )",
    "mass @xmath8 is a function only of @xmath36 . using the scaled variable @xmath37 with @xmath38 , we write the mass function in terms of the ` multiplicity function ' @xmath39 as @xmath40 in the spirit of using ps as a fitting function to n - body simulations we do not imbue @xmath41 with a cosmology dependence ( see next section ) but rather keep it constant . the press - schechter model for @xmath39",
    "is @xmath42 and this formula has been extensively used to make predictions of cluster abundances in different cosmologies . recently",
    "sheth & tormen  ( 1999 ) have proposed a correction to the press - schechter formula , motivated by a model of non - spherical collapse , that better fits large n - body simulations : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the normalization is fixed by the requirement that all of the mass be in haloes , i.e. @xmath46 for the above choice of parameters the normalization factor is 0.2162 .",
    "jenkins et al .   have shown that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fnu ] ) is in very good agreement with the simulations of the virgo consortium , except for very rare objects which shall not be of interest in this work .",
    "we compare the multiplicity functions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnu ] . note that press - schechter systematically overestimates the abundance of objects of cluster mass having @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and underestimates the abundance of objects corresponding to a higher @xmath49 .",
    "the spherical top - hat ansatz @xcite models the formation of an object by the evolution of a spherical overdense region embedded in a homogeneous ` background ' of mean density @xmath16 .",
    "this region begins by expanding at the same rate as the background , but since it is positively curved the expansion slows , comes to a halt and the region collapses .",
    "mathematically the evolution proceeds to a point of zero radius , however physically we assume that virialization occurs at twice the turn - around time , resulting in a sphere of half the turn - around radius .",
    "the overdensity ( relative to the background ) at turn - around is @xmath50 for an einstein - de sitter model . at virialization",
    "the background has become less dense and the sphere s density grown by a further factor of 8  we then denote the overdensity relative to the critical density by @xmath51 .",
    "this parameter has the value @xmath52 in an einstein - de sitter model , and will in general be a function of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the extrapolation from linear theory of this overdensity is normally denoted @xmath41 .",
    "it is @xmath55 for einstein - de sitter and varies by a few percent in other cosmologies .",
    "this density is used as a threshold in ps theory and its extensions .",
    "we shall neglect the small cosmology dependence and simply take @xmath41 fixed throughout .",
    "the value of the density contrast at collapse , @xmath51 , on the other hand , should be calculated for each model , since it will be important for the @xmath13 relation .",
    "we computed @xmath56 by numerically integrating the equations of motion for the spherical top - hat collapse , including the correction to the virial theorem from the @xmath57 potential ( lahav et al .",
    "1991 ;  4.2 ) .",
    "our results can be fit to 2 per cent over the range @xmath58 and @xmath59 by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the coefficients @xmath63 are reported in table  [ tab : coef ] . as an example we plot @xmath51 vs @xmath53 for flat models , where the dashed line shows our fit and the solid line is the exact relation .",
    "we also checked this fit with the one provided by eke , navarro & frenk .",
    "( 1998b ) and found an agreement at the 1 per cent level .",
    "note that some authors use a different convention in which @xmath56 is specified relative to the background matter density ",
    "our @xmath56 is @xmath31 times theirs .",
    "the local abundance of rich clusters of galaxies currently provides one of the strongest constraints on the normalization of the present day dark matter power spectrum on a scale of @xmath64mpc .",
    "while there have been numerous detailed studies of this constraint in the past , recent developments in both theory and observation have made it worthwhile to revisit this quantity .",
    "we have calculated the constraint on @xmath0 arising from a new local sample of x - ray clusters with _",
    "asca _  temperatures .",
    "we have incorporated the universal mass function determined from recent large n - body simulations , which is sufficiently different from the ps theory that the cosmological constraints inferred from cluster abundances change .",
    "we tried to carefully define the relation between mass and x - ray temperature for galaxy clusters , based on the results of many different hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "another major difference with previous work was that we performed all the comparisons at the ` observed epoch ' rather than carrying out an integration over ` formation times ' .",
    "we also considered general combinations of @xmath53 and @xmath65 , including closed models .",
    "our results are best presented in terms of a normalization at the characteristic scale for our sample , @xmath3 , where the normalization is largely independent of the power spectrum shape .    in the near future",
    "we anticipate a dramatic increase in our knowledge of the cosmological parameters from cmb anisotropy missions .",
    "in particular it has been forecast @xcite that _ map _  will be able to determine @xmath0 to 14 per cent , at the same time as constraining a suite of other parameters .",
    "the cluster abundance constraint is currently uncertain only at the @xmath66 per cent level , and so certainly is a pivotal limit on models  it is also an entirely independent constraint ( at low @xmath67 , in the mildly non - linear regime ) compared with the cmb determinations ( derived from the purely linear regime at @xmath68 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived @xmath0 could be dramatically reduced with improvement in the @xmath13 relation , as well as through new x - ray data coming from _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_.    future x - ray surveys , which go much fainter will lead to an increase in the size and quality of the x - ray data .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vt ] that there is lots of volume that was not probed at , say , @xmath69kev .",
    "for example the _ rosat _  bright survey @xcite contains an approximately complete flux - limited sample of 302 clusters at @xmath70 , most of them lying at low redshift , which would be an excellent data - base if they all had good temperature estimates .",
    "more important than just increasing the precision of the x - ray temperature measurements is an increase in the quality of data , for the purposes of more fully understanding the comparison with models .",
    "better spatial and spectral information from x - ray clusters should allow more reliable estimates for the value of @xmath71 which is most appropriate for comparing with the simulations . in a similar vein ,",
    "improved optical studies of lensing and velocity dispersions could improve mass determinations for individual clusters .",
    "the major improvement will come through a more precise mass - temperature relation for x - ray clusters .",
    "this will require both the improved data which we can foresee from _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ , _ and _ improvements in modelling the gas physics relevant for understanding the x - ray properties of clusters .",
    "eventually we imagine that the data will be fit more directly to much more ambitious simulations  this will be extremely difficult in practice , since a wide range of scales needs to be modelled simultaneously . in the meantime",
    "the piece - meal approach we have taken here will continue to be useful . with each of the ingredients , particularly the mass - temperature relation , improving with time",
    ", the cluster abundance will continue to be a strong constraint on the normalization of dark matter fluctuations on the @xmath64mpc scale .",
