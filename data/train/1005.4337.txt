    "understanding the statistical behavior of computer network traffic has been an important and challenging problem for the past 15 years , because of its impact on network performance and provisioning @xcite and on the potential for development of more suitable protocols @xcite . since the early 1990s",
    "it has been well established that the traffic over a _ single link _ exhibits intricate temporal dependence , known as _ burstiness _ , which could not be explained by traffic models developed for telephone networks @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon could be understood and described by using the notions of long  range dependence and self ",
    "similarity @xcite , which in turn are affected by the presence of heavy tails in the distribution of file sizes @xcite . a bottom - up _ mechanistic _ model for single link network traffic that is in agreement with the empirical features observed in real network traces was presented in @xcite .",
    "a competing model based on queuing ideas was studied in @xcite .",
    "these works lead to many further developments ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "advances in technology that allowed the acquisition of direct , through sampling @xcite , and indirect @xcite measurements have allowed researchers to examine the characteristics of traffic in entire networks @xcite , based on statistical modeling analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "an analogue of the mechanistic models available for single link network traffic is not available .",
    "such a model would allow better understanding of network performance @xcite and detection of anomalous behavior @xcite .",
    "further , it would manage to capture and explain statistical relationships between flows traversing the network at all time scales ( time ) and across all links ( space ) ; the latter represents a fairly tall requirement , which may also prove rather impractical given the underlying complexity ( protocols , applications ) and heterogeneity ( physical infrastructure , diverse users ) of modern networks .",
    "our objective in this paper is to propose a mechanistic model that captures several fundamental characteristics of network - wide traffic and thus constitutes a partial solution for this challenging problem .",
    "the model is based on modeling user behavior on source  destination paths across the network and then aggregate over users and over time , thus developing a _ joint _",
    "space  time probability model for the traffic fluctuations over _ all links _ in the network .",
    "this model reflects the statistical dependence of the traffic across different links , observed at the same or different points in time .",
    "we demonstrate the success of our modeling strategy in the context of _ network traffic prediction _  a problem with important implications on network performance , provisioning , and management .",
    "_ the remainder of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "_ in section [ s : single - link ] , we review briefly the existing and relatively well  understood theory of single  flow ( link ) models for the temporal dependence in network traffic . long  range dependence and heavy tails play a central role . in section [ s : network - wide ] , we postulate our network  wide model based on combining single ",
    "flow models through the routing equation .",
    "we show that the scaling limit of such a model is a combination of fractional brownian motions and infinite variance stable lvy motions .",
    "a succinct representation of these processes is given in section [ s : f - fbm , f - lsm ] via the _ functional fractional brownian motion _ and _ functional lvy stable motion_. the resulting model is then used in section [ s : kriging ] to solve the _ network kriging _ problem , i.e.  to predict the traffic fluctuations on a unobserved link from a limited set of measurements of observed links . in section [ s :",
    "netflow ] , we use extensive netflow data of sampled network traffic to obtain approximations of the flow ",
    "level traffic @xmath0 .",
    "these data are then used to validate our model and demonstrate the success of the network kriging methodology .",
    "we conclude in section [ s : discussion ] with some remarks on future applications , statistical problems on networks , and further extensions of the network  wide probabilistic model .",
    "consider a computer network of @xmath1 links and @xmath2 nodes .",
    "the network typically carries traffic _ flows _",
    "( via groups of packets ) from any node ( source ) to any other node ( destination ) over a predetermined set of links ( route )",
    ". this can be formally described by the _ routing matrix _ @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and where @xmath5 is the total number of routes ( typically , @xmath6 ) .",
    "_ we describe next the physical premises of our modeling framework .",
    "_ we assume , for simplicity , that the traffic is _",
    "fluid_. that is , the amount of data ( bytes ) transmitted over link @xmath7 during the time interval @xmath8 is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the _ traffic intensity _ ( bytes per unit time ) over link @xmath7 .",
    "let also @xmath0 denote the traffic intensity at time @xmath11 over route @xmath12 .",
    "then , assuming that traffic propagates instantaneously over the network , we obtain the following _ routing equation _ : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this relationship is valid only to the extent that traffic propagates _ instantaneously _ along the routes .",
    "thus , can not be adopted over the finest , high  frequency time scales where packet delay plays a central role . on the other hand , for all practical purposes",
    ", the routing equation holds over a wide range of time scales greater than the rtt ( round trip time ) for packets in the network @xcite .",
    "this equation captures the fundamental relationship between the traffic intensity over different routes in the network and the resulting load , incurred on the links .    from a physical perspective",
    ", the computer network is merely used to transport information from source nodes to destination nodes . in normal ( uncongested ) operating regime ,",
    "the traffic is carried seamlessly and the traffic intensities @xmath0 are driven solely by the _ demand _ along the routes @xmath16 thus , as a first approximation one may view the @xmath0 s as statistically independent in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in view of , the statistical dependence between @xmath17 and @xmath18 for two links @xmath19 and @xmath20 , is governed by the set of routes @xmath0 that use both @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in view of the above discussion , guided by the routing equation , we obtain a global model for the traffic intensity @xmath21 .",
    "the temporal dependence of the flow ",
    "level traffic @xmath0 can be described well by the existing mechanistic models exhibiting long  range dependence and heavy tails ( see section [ s : single - link ] ) .",
    "the independence of the @xmath0 s in @xmath22 is a questionable assumption when the network is not in equilibrium or it is congested . indeed ,",
    "if two routes share a congested node , then the feedback mechanism of tcp clearly induces dependence between the two flows .",
    "further , since every tcp session involves ack ( acknowledgment ) packets traversing along the _ reverse _ route , then in practice one expects dependence between the _ forward _ and _ reverse _ flows for a given pair of a source and destination .",
    "our experience with netflow data for the internet2 backbone network suggests however that for the present utilization levels of the network ( about 10% to 20% ) the @xmath0 s are nearly uncorrelated in @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : x - corr ] in section [ s : netflow ] ) .",
    "the correlation is strongest but still rather weak among the forward and reverse flows ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , as a first attempt to model globally the dependence structure of the network across all links and in time , we advocate adopting the simple assumption of independence of the flow  level traffic .",
    "our methodology can be extended to cover more complex scenarios of dependence between forward and reverse flows , as well as second ",
    "order effects of dependence between flows triggered by congestion .",
    "this should be done with caution however since the chaotic behavior induced by the tcp feedback is not well  understood on network  wide level .",
    "we start with a brief review of single  link traffic models , since a number of their features are incorporated into our network  wide model .",
    "such models are built on the paradigm of multiple users sharing a link .",
    "depending on the regimes prevalent in the network , one obtains two qualitatively different asymptotic models for the cumulative traffic fluctuations .",
    "one regime leads to finite  variance , gaussian models that exhibit long  range dependence and self  similarity .",
    "the other regime yields infinite variance processes with independent increments .",
    "consider a fixed route on the network and suppose that @xmath23 independent users share this route .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the traffic intensity of one such user in bytes per unit time .",
    "thus @xmath25 is the total traffic ( bytes ) generated by the user during the time interval @xmath8 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath24 is a strictly stationary stochastic process with finite mean .    following the framework in @xcite ,",
    "let @xmath26 be a stationary marked point process of arrival times @xmath27 s in @xmath28 with marks @xmath29 s . at time @xmath27",
    ", the user initiates a transmission at constant unit rate , which lasts time @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the traffic intensity at time @xmath11 equals : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "one can recover the following two popular traffic models as special cases :    * _ @xmath32 model : _ if the @xmath27 s are arrival times of a poisson point process with constant intensity , independent of the marks @xmath29 s , then @xmath24 becomes the @xmath32 model . *",
    "_ on / off model : _ on the other hand , if the @xmath29 s and the @xmath27 s are _ dependent _ and such that : @xmath33 then @xmath34 follows the _ on / off model _ ,",
    "i.e.  a period of activity ( on ) is followed by an idle period ( off ) .",
    "it is further assumed that the _ on _ periods : @xmath35 and the _ off _ periods @xmath36 , are mutually independent and identically distributed with laws @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the initial _ on _ period @xmath39 has such a distribution as to ensure that @xmath40 is stationary .",
    "this can happen only if the _ on _ and _ off _ periods have finite means . the work @xcite addresses the case of activity rates with very heavy tails , which can have infinite means .    in the context of network traffic ,",
    "the _ durations _ of the user activity @xmath29 s are modeled with heavy tailed distributions with finite mean but infinite variance , since they can be linked to the ubiquitous presence of heavy tails in computer networks ( file sizes , web pages , etc .",
    "see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the heavy tailed nature of the durations , implies that the process @xmath34 of user activity is long  range dependent ( lrd ) .",
    "the intimate connection between the long  range dependence phenomenon and self  similarity provides an appealing mechanistic ( physical ) explanation of the cause of burstiness in network traffic ( see e.g.@xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .    for brevity , we focus on the _ on / off model _ and suppose that the tails of the on and off durations are heavy , i.e.  as @xmath41 : @xmath42 for some constants @xmath43 and tail exponents , such that @xmath44 relation then implies that @xmath34 is lrd with hurst exponent @xmath45 that is , for some constant @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let now @xmath48 ,  @xmath49 be independent and identically distributed stationary processes modeling the traffic intensities of @xmath23 users sharing a given route .",
    "then , the cumulative traffic over the route generated by the users is : @xmath50 we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the cumulative traffic fluctuations about the mean : @xmath51    as shown in the seminal work of @xcite , if the @xmath52 s are _ on / off processes _ , then @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) with self  similarity parameter @xmath55 as in and where @xmath56 denotes finite  dimensional distributions convergence .",
    "recall that the fbm @xmath57 is a zero mean gaussian process with stationary increments , which is self  similar , i.e.   for all @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 .",
    "one necessarily has that @xmath60 and , for some @xmath61 : @xmath62 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "relation shows that the fluctuations of the cumulative traffic about its mean behave asymptotically like the fractional brownian motion , as the number of users @xmath23 and the time scale @xmath63 are sufficiently large .",
    "the increments @xmath64 of fbm then can then serve as a model for the traffic traces of the number of bytes transmitted over the network over certain , sufficiently large time scales .",
    "the order of the limits in is important .",
    "if one takes @xmath65 first and then @xmath66 , as shown in @xcite , one obtains : @xmath67 now the limit process @xmath68 has _ independent _ and stationary increments with @xmath69stable distributions , with @xmath70 being as in .",
    "it is the lvy stable motion ",
    "the infinite variance counterpart to the brownian motion .",
    "relations and show two different regimes for the network .",
    "the first involves many users relative to the time scale and the second , just a few users relative to the time scale . as shown in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , one can consider the limit when the number of users @xmath71 grows to infinity , as a function of the time scale @xmath63 . then :    * _ ( fast growth ) _ if @xmath72 as @xmath65 , then @xmath73 * _ ( slow growth ) _ if @xmath74 as @xmath65 , then @xmath75    the _ fast growth _",
    "scenario shows that if the number of users @xmath76 grows relatively fast , then the same limit as in is achieved . the _ slow growth _",
    "regime on the other hand , yields the stable lvy motion in the limit , when there are relatively few users sharing the link .",
    "the intermediate regime when @xmath77 is considered in @xcite .",
    "this abundant theory offers a multitude of tools for modeling the temporal dependence of traffic traces in various regimes . for example",
    ", the users need not be of the same type . as in @xcite one may consider @xmath78 classes of users @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 as @xmath82 the users within a given class are of the same type with parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 . by balancing the rates of the @xmath85",
    "s one can obtain in the limit @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are independent fbm s and lvy stable motions , respectively . here",
    "@xmath89 is the partition of the groups of users into subsets of _ fast _ and _ slow _ growth regimes , respectively .",
    "similar results were shown to hold for the @xmath32 and other activity rate models ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    1 .",
    "if the individual user behavior is modeled by @xmath32 processes with heavy  tailed , infinite variance durations @xmath29 s , then similar asymptotic results hold for the cumulative traffic fluctuations .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite , this is so for the general activity rate model in . 2 .",
    "as argued above , by balancing the rates of multiple groups of users , one can obtain complex hybrid models , composed of fbm s and lvy stable motions . in practice , however , typically one component dominates .",
    "in fact , as shown in @xcite , the fbm limit is more robust than the lvy stable motion with respect to the type and the regimes of the activity rate models considered .",
    "+ in fact , the fundamental theorem of lamperti ( see eg theorem 2.1.1 in @xcite ) implies an interesting _ robustness _ and _ homogeneity _ property .",
    "namely , suppose that @xmath52 s are all _ stationary _ in @xmath11 . if the the time ",
    "scale limit @xmath90 is non  trivial , then it is necessarily _ self ",
    "similar_. that is , @xmath91 for all @xmath58 with some @xmath92 .",
    "+ this implies that if the number of users @xmath23 is either fixed or already large enough for the gaussian asymptotics to hold , then the time ",
    "scaling limit is necessarily either a single lvy stable motion , or a single fractional brownian motion . +",
    "thus the complex hybrid models involving sums of multiple fbm s and lvy stable motions are rather fragile .",
    "that is , they may occur only if a careful balance between the rate of growth of the users and the time ",
    "scale is imposed . in reality , the single  fbm and single ",
    "lvy stable motion provide good , first ",
    "order limit approximations of traffic fluctuations that remain valid under changes of time  scales . +",
    "this observation is the reason why we advocate studying first the simpler , self  similar models involving either a single fbm or a single lvy stable motion .",
    "accounting for the hybrid models involves careful considerations of time  scales , which presents formidable statistical challenges .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we assume that traffic is _ fluid _ and it propagates instantaneously through the network so that the _ routing equation _ holds . as in section",
    "[ s : single - link ] , we model the traffic intensity @xmath0 over route @xmath22 as a composition of @xmath93 independent users .",
    "we suppose , in addition that the @xmath0 s are independent in @xmath22 and composed of @xmath93 independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) _ on / off _ sources : @xmath94 we then obtain the following results :    [ t : fast - regime ] let @xmath0 s be as in , where the _ on / off components _ have common parameter @xmath70 as in .",

    "their proofs follow readily from the well  known single  flow results with an application of the continuous mapping theorem .      in this section , we introduce two classes of stochastic processes , indexed by functions , which can be used to succinctly represent the limit processes arising in theorems [ t : fast - regime ] and [ t : slow - regime ] . the purpose of this more abstract treatment is to develop tools and insight that can be used in statistical inference for the network models .",
