    "ly@xmath0 absorption line forests in qso spectra come from intervening absorbers , or clouds , with neutral hydrogen column densities ranging from about @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xmath4 at high red - shifts .",
    "since the size of the ly@xmath0 clouds at high red - shift is as large as 100 - 200 h@xmath1 kpc , and their velocity dispersion is as low as @xmath5 100 km s@xmath1 ( bechtold et al .",
    "1994 , dinshaw et al .",
    "1995 , fang et al . 1996 ) , it is generally believed that the ly@xmath0 forests are due to the absorption of pre - collapsed clouds in the density field of the universe .",
    "ly@xmath0 clouds are probably fair tracers of the cosmic density field on large scales and therefore , the clustering behavior of the ly@xmath0 clouds should be useful for testing models of structure formation of the universe .    more importantly , unlike other high redshift objects , ly@xmath0 forests do not show significant power in their two - point correlation functions . aside from very small scales",
    "@xmath6 km / s , all results drawn from the two - point correlation function of the ly@xmath0 absorption lines have failed to detect clustering ( webb , 1987 , weymann 1993 , hu et al .",
    "1995 , cristiani et al .",
    "the power spectrum of the 1-d spatial distribution of the ly@xmath0 absorbers is found to be flat on scales in velocity space of @xmath5 600 to 30,000 km s@xmath1 ( pando & fang 1998 ) .",
    "this result indicates that the distribution of the ly@xmath0 clouds may still be in the linear or quasilinear evolutionary stages on scales larger than a few h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "indeed , it is found that simulations of popular models using the linear or log - normal approximation fit well with the second order statistical properties of ly@xmath0 forests ( bi , ge & fang 1995 , bi & davidson 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , the ly@xmath0 clouds may contain information of cosmic clustering in the linear or quasilinear evolutionary stages .",
    "it is known that even though the evolution of the power spectrum during the quasi - linear regime does not significantly differ from the linear regime , the density perturbations on different scales will no longer evolve mutually independently because of the power transfer of perturbations via mode coupling . for popular models , like the cold dark matter model , the mode - mode coupling of the quasi - linear evolution leads to a power transfer from large scales to small ones ( suto & sasaki 1991 ) .",
    "numerical studies show that the power transfer is already significant on scales of about 50 h@xmath1 mpc at redshift @xmath7 ( jing et al .",
    "thus , there should exist non - gaussianity on scales of a few 10 h@xmath1 mpc which is the `` remnant '' of the mode - mode coupling of the quasi - linear evolution .",
    "this theory is supported by works based on methods other than the two - point correlation function .",
    "for instance , the distribution of nearest neighbor ly@xmath0 line intervals is found to be definitely different from a poisson process ( duncan , ostriker , & bajtlik 1989 ; liu and jones 1990 ) .",
    "a study using the kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) statistic , finds that ly@xmath0 absorbers show a deviation from a uniform random distribution at the @xmath8 significance level ( fang , 1991 ) .",
    "some observations also indicate the existence of @xmath9 mpc void ( dobrzycki & bechtold 1991 ) , and deviation from uniform distribution on larger scales ( crotts 1987 , 1989 . ) however , this individual structure can not be used for a statistical analysis . using a method based on cluster identification ,",
    "many structures have been systematically identified and formed into an ensemble .",
    "it is found that the abundance of the identified  clusters \" with respect to the richness are significantly different from a gaussian process ( pando & fang 1996 , hereafter pf ) .",
    "recently , we have also found that the ly@xmath0 forest line distribution shows significant scale - scale correlations . as a consequence models which predict a gaussian process for the evolution of the ly@xmath0 clouds",
    "are ruled out , and the halos hosting the clouds must have gone through a `` history '' dependent merging process during their formation ( pando et al . 1998 . )    in this paper , we will continue to develop the description of the non - gaussianity of the ly@xmath0 line distribution .",
    "the emphasis of this paper will be to detect the non - gaussian spectrum , and to show its ability to discriminate among models of ly@xmath0 cloud formation which are degenerate at second order .",
    "in  2 , we will describe the observed and simulated samples of ly@xmath0 forests , and the problems related to their large scale structure detection . in  3 , the dwt technique of non - gaussian spectrum detection will be discussed .",
    "the results of this analysis for real and simulated samples are discussed in  4 .",
    "we will show that the distributions of ly@xmath0 forest lines are significantly different from gaussian distributions .",
    "additionally , we show that the non - gaussian spectrum is a powerful tool for distinguishing between models .",
    "in pf , we looked at two popular data sets of ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the first compiled by lu , wolfe and turnshek ( 1991 , hereafter lwt ) contains @xmath5 950 lines from the spectra of 38 qso that exhibit neither broad absorption lines nor metal line systems .",
    "the second set is from bechtold ( 1994 , hereafter jb ) , which contains @xmath5 2800 lines from 78 qso s spectra , in which 34 high red - shift qsos were observed at moderate resolution . in this paper",
    ", we augment those data sets with two observations using the keck telescope : 1 ) hu et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter hkcsr ) observed 4 qso s with a total of 1056 lines and column density in the range @xmath10 @xmath4 at extremely high s / n ; 2 ) kirkman and tytler ( 1997 , hereafter kt ) obtained the highest quality spectra published to date from qso hs 1946 + 7658 with 466 ly@xmath0 forest lines .",
    "a typical sample is shown in figure 1 , which is a 1-d histogram of the spatial distribution of ly@xmath0 absorption lines of qso-0142 .",
    "it is well known that the number density of the ly@xmath0 absorption lines increases with red - shift .",
    "the number density of lines with rest equivalent width @xmath11 greater than a threshold @xmath12 can approximately be described as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number density extrapolated to zero red - shift , and @xmath15 the index of evolution .",
    "lwt finds that @xmath16 and @xmath17 for lines with @xmath18 .",
    "kt finds @xmath19 while jb finds that @xmath20 for @xmath21@xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .    like other ly@xmath0 forest data , these data sets have failed to reveal structures in their distribution on scales @xmath25 km / s when subjected to a two point correlation analysis ( hu et al",
    "using the discrete wavelet transform spectrum estimator , the fourier power spectrum of the 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) spatial distribution of these data is found to be almost flat on scales from 2 to about 100 h@xmath1 mpc ( pando & fang 1998 ) . for comparison ,",
    "figure 1 also shows a randomized sample which is produced by a random shifting of the lines of qso-0142 .",
    "obviously , one can not simply distinguish the real sample and its random counterpart by inspection .",
    "in fact , when analyzed by second order statistics , the real data are still indistinguishable from randomized samples .",
    "these results indicate that 2nd order statistical techniques , i.e. the two - point correlation function and the power spectrum , are not even qualitatively sufficient to describe the clustering features of these samples .",
    "higher order measures are not a correction to lower order descriptions , but crucial in describing the ly@xmath0 forest traced matter field .    this conclusion is strengthened by studying simulated samples .",
    "typically , simulated density fields for pre - collapsed clouds are generated as perturbations with a linear or linear log - normal spectrum given by models such as the cold dark matter model ( scdm ) , the cold plus hot dark matter model ( chdm ) , and the low density flat cold dark matter model ( lcdm ) .",
    "the baryonic matter distribution is then produced by assuming that the baryonic matter traces the dark matter distribution on scales larger than the jeans length of the baryonic gas , but is smooth over structures on scales less than the jeans length . the simulated ly@xmath0 absorption spectrum can be calculated as the absorption of neutral hydrogen in the baryonic gas .",
    "the effects of the observational instrumental point - spread - function , along with poisson and background noises can also be simulated properly ( bi , ge & fang 1995 , hereafter bgf ; bi & davidson 1997 ) .    within a reasonable set of parameters ,",
    "the simulated samples are found to fit with observational measurements such as the number density of ly@xmath0 clouds , the distribution of equivalent widths , the red - shift - dependence of the width distributions and clustering .",
    "regardless the details of the simulation , these samples should contain structures because the effects of gravitational collapse have been considered , and baryonic matter does not distribute uniformly random , but traces the structure of dark matter .",
    "however , as is the case with observations , the simulated samples show no power in their two - point correlations ( see figure.11 of bgf ) , and their 1-d spectra are rather flat on scales less than 100 h@xmath1mpc .",
    "these results clearly show that higher order measures are necessary in describing the statistical features of the 1-d distributions of the ly@xmath0 clouds .",
    "it is generally believed that the cosmic mass ( or number ) density distribution @xmath26 can be mathematically treated as a homogeneous random field .",
    "it is often more convenient to express @xmath26 in terms of its fourier transform , @xmath27 , which is the fourier coefficient of @xmath28 .",
    "one reason for expressing the density distribution in terms of its fourier transform is that for gaussian random fields all the statistical features of @xmath28 can be completely described by the amplitude of the fourier coefficients . in this case , the phase of @xmath27 is not important and the power spectrum of the perturbations , @xmath29 , or equivalently , the two - point correlation function , are all that is necessary to describe the statistical behavior of the density distribution .",
    "however , if the field @xmath28 is non - gaussian , then in order to have a full statistical description of the field the phases of the fourier coefficients @xmath27 are essential .    as is well known , it is difficult , even practically impossible , to find information about the phases of the fourier coefficient as soon as there is some computational noise .",
    "the lack of information about the phases makes the @xmath27 description incomplete : we might know the scales @xmath30 of the structures , but nothing about the positions of the considered structures .",
    "a possible way of simultaneously describing the scale and position of structures is provided by the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) ( daubechies 1992 , meyer 1993 . )",
    "the dwt analysis has successfully been applied to the problems of turbulence ( yamada & ohkitani 1991 ; farge 1992 ) and high energy physics ( huang et al . 1996 . )",
    "our previous studies also show that the dwt analysis is useful for large scale structure study ( pando & fang 1996 , fang & pando 1997 , 1998 ; pando et al .",
    "1998 , fang , deng & xia , 1998 , xu , fang & wu , 1998 . )",
    "let s consider a 1-d mass density contrast @xmath31/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] , which covers a spatial range @xmath32 .",
    "the expansion of the field @xmath28 in terms of the dwt basis is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the basis of the dwt .",
    "the dwt basis are orthogonal and complete .",
    "the wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) , @xmath37 , is computed by @xmath38    the wavelet transform basis functions @xmath34 are generated from the basic wavelet @xmath39 by a dilation , @xmath40 , and a translation @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 the basic wavelet @xmath43 is designed to be continuous , admissible and localized . unlike the fourier basis @xmath44 , which are non - local in physical space , the wavelet basis @xmath34 are localized in both physical space and fourier ( scale ) space . in physical space , @xmath34 is centered at position @xmath45 , and in fourier space , it is centered at wavenumber @xmath46 . therefore , the wfcs , @xmath37 , have two subscripts @xmath47 and @xmath41 , which describe , respectively , the scale and position of the density perturbations .    a clearer picture of how the transforms work can be seen in the phase space @xmath48 . a complete",
    ", orthogonal basis set resolves the whole phase space into  elements \" of size @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "each mode corresponds to elements in the phase space . for the fourier transform",
    ", this corresponds to elements of size @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the wavelet transform ,",
    "both @xmath50 and @xmath49 are finite , and the corresponding area of the element is as small as @xmath53 .",
    "that is , the dwt is able to resolve an arbitrary function simultaneously in terms of @xmath54 and @xmath30 up to the limit of the uncertainty principle .",
    "the dwt decomposes the density fluctuation field @xmath55 into domains @xmath56 in phase space , and for each mode , the corresponding area in the phase space is as small as that allowed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "the wfc @xmath37 and its intensity @xmath57 describe , respectively , the fluctuation of the density and its power on scale @xmath58 at position @xmath45 . as with the fourier basis ,",
    "parseval s theorem holds for the dwt basis .",
    "it is ( fang & pando 1997 , pando & fang , 1998 ) @xmath59 it is possible to define the power spectrum of the density perturbation on scale @xmath47 by the variance of the wfcs as @xmath60 where @xmath61 it has been shown that the dwt power spectrum eq.(6 ) can be converted to the fourier power spectrum , i.e. in terms of second order statistical description the dwt and fourier transform are equivalent .",
    "the cosmic density field is usually assumed to be ergodic : the average over an ensemble is equal to the spatial average taken over one realization .",
    "this is the so - called ",
    "fair sample hypothesis \" ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "a homogeneous gaussian field with continuous spectrum is certainly ergodic ( adler 1981 ) . in some non - gaussian cases , such as homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ( vanmarke , 1983 ) , ergodicity also approximately holds .",
    "roughly , the ergodic hypothesis is reasonable if spatial correlations are decreasing sufficiently rapidly with increasing separation . in this case , the volumes separated by large distances are approximately statistically independent , and can be treated as independent realizations . note that the @xmath34 are orthogonal with respect to the position index @xmath41 , and therefore , for an ergodic field , the @xmath40 wfcs , @xmath37 , @xmath62 , at a given @xmath47 should be statistically independent .",
    "thus the wfcs @xmath37 at fixed @xmath47 and different @xmath41 can be treated as independent measures of the density fluctuation field .",
    "the @xmath40 wfcs , @xmath37 , from _",
    "one _ realization of @xmath55 can be employed as a statistical ensemble . in this way ,",
    "when the fair sample hypothesis holds , an average of the ensemble can be well estimated by averaging over @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "consequently , the distribution of the @xmath37 is actually the one - point distribution of the wfcs at a given scale @xmath47 .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the density field @xmath55 can directly be measured by the deviation of the one - point distribution from a gaussian distribution .",
    "for this purpose , we can calculate the cumulant moments defined by ( carruthers 1991 ; carruthers , eggers & sarcevic 1991 ) @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 from eqs.(6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) , one sees that the second order cumulant moment is the dwt power spectrum on the scale @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath70    for gaussian fields all the cumulant moments higher than order 2 are zero .",
    "thus one can measure the non - gaussianity of the density field @xmath55 by @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "analogous to @xmath73 being called the dwt power spectrum , we will call @xmath71 the dwt spectrum of @xmath74-th cumulant . the cumulant measures @xmath75 and @xmath76 are related to the better known skewness and kurtosis , respectively .",
    "thus , the non - gaussianity of @xmath55 can be detected by the dwt skewness and kurtosis spectra defined as @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 are basic statistical measures employed in this paper .    for comparison ,",
    "the definitions of the `` standard '' skewness @xmath81 and kurtosis @xmath82 for a 1-d distribution @xmath55 covering on @xmath83 bins are given as follows @xmath84 and @xmath85 - 3,\\ ] ] where the variance @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 obviously , no scale information is given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is well known that not all one - point distributions can detect non - gaussianities .",
    "this is due to the constraints imposed by the central limit theorem .",
    "for instance , if the universe consists of a large number of dense clumps with a non - gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) , the one - point distributions of the real and imaginary components of each individual fourier mode are still gaussian due to the central limit theorem ( ivanonv & leonenko 1989 ) .",
    "further , even when the non - gaussian clumps are correlated the central limit theorem still holds if the two - point correlation function of the clumps approaches zero sufficiently fast ( fan & bardeen 1995 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the one - point distribution function of fourier modes is not sensitive enough to detect deviations from gaussian behavior . even for samples with strong non - linear evolution",
    ", the one point distribution function of fourier modes is found to be consistent with a gaussian distribution ( suginohara & suto 1991 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the inefficiency of the fourier mode one - point distribution in detecting non - gaussianity is not because fourier transform loses information about the distribution @xmath88 .",
    "the fourier coefficients contain all the information on non - gaussianity , but the information is mainly contained in the phases of the fourier coefficients . as mentioned in  3.1 , it is very difficult to detect the distribution of the phases of fourier coefficients .    on the other hand ,",
    "the wavelet coefficients are not subject to the central limit theorem . in this respect ,",
    "the dwt analysis is similar to the count in cell ( cic ) method ( hamilton 1985 ; alimi , blanchard & schaeffer 1990 ; gaztaaga & yokoyama 1993 ; bouchet et al .",
    "1993 ; kofman et al .",
    "1994 ; gaztaaga & frieman 1994 ) .",
    "the cic is not subject to the central limit theorem as it based on spatially localized window functions ( adler 1981 ) .",
    "the dwt s basis are also localized .",
    "if the scale of a clump in the universe is @xmath89 , eq.(3 ) shows that the wfcs , @xmath37 , with @xmath90 , is determined only by the density field in a range containing no more than one clump .",
    "that is , for scale @xmath47 the wavelet coefficients are not given by a superposition of a large number of clumps , but are determined by at most one of them .",
    "therefore , it avoids the constraints imposed by the central limit theorem .",
    "this point can also be shown from the orthonormal basis being used for the expansion of the distribution @xmath55 .",
    "a basic condition of the central limit theorem is that the modulus of the basis be less than @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a constant ( ivanonv & leonenko 1989 ) .",
    "obviously , all fourier - related orthonormal basis satisfy this condition because @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where @xmath92 is independent of coordinates in both physical space @xmath54 and scale space @xmath30 . on the other hand ,",
    "the normalized wavelets functions have [ eq.(4 ) ] @xmath95 because the magnitude of the basic wavelet @xmath96 is of order 1 .",
    "the condition @xmath97 will no longer hold for a constant @xmath92 independent of scale variable @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the one - point - distribution of wavelet coefficients on scale @xmath47 should be a good estimator for the pdf of a distribution .",
    "the observational qso ly@xmath0 forests data have a complex geometry . by this",
    "we mean that different forests cover different spatial ranges , and no one of the forests distributes on the entire range @xmath98 . at the very least , a complicated weighting scheme is needed in order to form an ensemble .",
    "the dwt provides a way around this problem . because wavelets are localized , the wavelet coefficients are only determined by the local distribution .",
    "if a forest sample lies in range @xmath99 , one can extend it to @xmath100 by adding zeros to the data in ranges @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the wavelet coefficients in the interval @xmath99 will not be affected by the addition of zero in @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "any statistics can then be computed by the ensemble of wavelet coefficients , @xmath105 , by simply dropping all wavelet coefficients with @xmath41 in the added zero ranges .",
    "more precisely , the effect of zero padding on the wavelet coefficients is described by the so - called  influence cone \" which consists of the spatial support of all dilated wavelet functions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath106 is localized in the space interval @xmath49 for @xmath107 , the influence cone centered at @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 $ ] ( farge 1992 ) .",
    "wavelet coefficients corresponding to positions outside @xmath110 will not corrupt information within the influence cone .",
    "the lwt and jb samples cover a red - shift range of 1.7 to 4.1 , i.e. the spatial range in comoving distance is from about @xmath111=2,300 @xmath112mpc to @xmath1133,300 @xmath114mpc , if @xmath115 and h@xmath116 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 . to eliminate the proximity effect ,",
    "all lines with @xmath117 are deleted from our samples .",
    "these two samples are extended to @xmath98 as described above , and binned into in 512 bins with comoving size @xmath5 2.5 h@xmath1 mpc , which is about the scale where the effect of line blending occurs .",
    "if a line is not located at the center of a bin , it is separated into the two neighboring bins , weighted according to the distance to each of the centers .",
    "the hkcsr and kt samples ( hkcsr+kt ) , can be treated the same way . since hkcsr and kt",
    "cover a smaller red - shift range from about 2.4 to 3.1 , the forests of hkcsr+kt are extended to 128 bins of comoving size @xmath5 2.5 h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "thus it is possible to compare all 3 sets for scales down to @xmath118 .      as opposed to @xmath55 discussed in  3 , real data provide only histograms of ly@xmath0 line distributions , i.e. the data are not a continuous function of @xmath54 , but a point process in @xmath54 space . in this case , the wfcs @xmath37 will not be calculated by an integral like eq.(3 ) , but by the wavelet transformation matrix ( press et al .",
    "1992 . )",
    "it is well known that point processes generally are non - gaussian .",
    "for instance , if the ly@xmath0 clouds do not distribute structurally , then @xmath55 should be a 1-d poisson process",
    ". however , poisson processes are non - gaussian .",
    "obviously , this non - gaussianity is not what we are seeking to measure because it is not the result of non - linear evolution or physical processes related to structure formation .",
    "therefore , we should carefully distinguish the clustering related non - gaussianity with that from sampling and binning . for this purpose ,",
    "we generate 5000 random realizations in which the mean number density follows eq.(1 ) .",
    "each realization is treated in the same way as the real data sets . from these random samples",
    "we can produce frequency distributions for each statistic , say @xmath119 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these frequency distributions are fair estimators of the underlying probability distribution .",
    "it can clearly be seen from figure 2 that the random data are non - gaussian .",
    "using these frequency distributions , the confidence levels for the mean values of the random data can be estimated .",
    "these are then to be compared with the real data .",
    "the skewness and kurtosis spectra of the lwt ( w@xmath120  ) , jb ( w@xmath121  ) and hkcst+kt ( b @xmath122 km s@xmath1 ) data are shown in figures 3 and 4 , respectively . the skewness and kurtosis spectra of random data and the 95% confidence levels are also shown in these figures .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show that the skewness and the kurtosis spectra of the lwt ( w@xmath123 ) and jb ( w@xmath124 ) are almost the same .",
    "the kurtosis spectra are @xmath125 , significantly different from the random samples on all scales , and , on scales @xmath47= 5 , the skewness spectra are also @xmath125 and significantly different from the random samples . the keck data , i.e. hkcsr+kt , have qualitatively the same non - gaussian behavior , especially at @xmath126 and @xmath119 , where the hkcsr+kt data are the same as that of lwt and jb .",
    "the hkcsr+kt gives lower values for @xmath127 and @xmath128 than the lwt and jb , while it gives higher @xmath129 and @xmath130 than lwt and jb . with the current data it is not possible to determine whether these differences are due to the higher resolution of the hkcsr+kt data",
    "it is important to realize that these observational data sets were compiled by different groups , on different instruments , and as much as 6 years apart .",
    "these data sets are very independent and makes more convincing the case for the existence of the non - gaussianity at least on scales of 5 - 10 h@xmath1 mpc , and confirms that the features shown in the non - gaussian spectrum are intrinsic features of the density field traced by ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "we can directly describe the non - gaussianity by the one - point distributions of the wfcs .",
    "figure 5 plots the one - point distributions of @xmath37 for the jb sample with @xmath124 . for each scale @xmath47 ,",
    "the corresponding gaussian distribution is plotted such that it has the same normalization and variance as the one - point distribution .",
    "this figure clearly shows that all the distributions on scales @xmath131 ( or less than about 80 h@xmath1 mpc ) are significantly non - gaussian .",
    "these distributions are also asymmetric , with fewer positive wavelet coefficients .",
    "this asymmetry is at least partially due to the red - shift - dependence of the ly@xmath0 clouds .",
    "the wavelet coefficient @xmath132 is mainly determined by the difference of ( positive ) densities at @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( pf ) . for a clump in red - shift space , the density change on the lower red - shift or lower",
    "@xmath41 side contributes negative wavelet coefficients , while the higher red - shift side gives positive wavelet coefficients .",
    "if as shown in pf , the number of ly@xmath0 clumps decreases with increasing red - shift , the change in clustering amplitudes ( wavelet coefficients ) on the higher red - shift side ( positive wavelet coefficients ) should be less than the lower side ( negative wavelet coefficients ) .",
    "that is , the number of positive wavelet coefficients will be less than negative wavelet coefficients .",
    "this is consistent with a small , but positive skewness .",
    "we have shown that cluster identification by a wavelet decomposition is a useful tool for discriminating among models of ly@xmath0 clouds ( pf ) .",
    "the spectrum of non - gaussianity can play the same role .",
    "namely , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are effective measures for removing the degeneracy that exists at second order among models .    as an example",
    ", we examined the bgf simulated ly@xmath0 forest samples .",
    "this simulation shows that two models , scdm and lcdm , are degenerate if only the first ( number density ) and second ( variance , or power spectrum ) order statistics are considered .",
    "that is , both scdm and lcdm give about the same predictions for the following features of the ly@xmath0 forests : a. ) the number density of ly@xmath0 lines and its dependencies on red - shift and equivalent width ; b. ) the distribution of equivalent widths and its red - shift dependence ; c. ) the two - point correlation function .",
    "this degeneracy can be removed by the non - gaussian spectrum .",
    "figure 6 plots the kurtosis spectra for the lcdm , scdm , and chdm models , in which the ly@xmath0 lines are chosen with width @xmath135 .",
    "the error bars in figure 6 are given by the distribution of 20 realizations for each model .",
    "figure 6 shows that even though the bgf simulation is based on the linear power spectrum of the density perturbations , the ly@xmath0 distribution is non - gaussian .",
    "this is because the selection of peaks from the density field is a non - gaussian processes .",
    "more important , figure 7 clearly shows the significant difference among the three models . with 95% confidence ,",
    "the @xmath80 amplitudes of all three models are different on all scales .",
    "the @xmath80 of the scdm model is significantly larger than zero for all scales @xmath47 .",
    "yet , the lcdm model gives much lower @xmath80 for all scales @xmath47 .",
    "the non - gaussian spectrum provides a extremely effective method for removing the degeneracy among models .",
    "the dwt skewness and kurtosis spectra of real and simulated samples of ly@xmath0 forests has been calculated .",
    "deviations from a gaussian state in these samples are detected for all data on scales of 5 to 10 h@xmath1 mpc with confidence level larger than 95% .",
    "for the two sets which are available on large scales , the non - gaussianity is significant even on scales as large as about 80 h@xmath1 mpc . the scale - dependence ( or spectrum ) for a the higher order dwt cumulant is especially effective in distinguishing the real samples from random data , and in discriminating among models .",
    "it is possible for non - gaussianity to result from systematic errors hiding in the original data reduction .",
    "for instance , discrete sampling or binning of a continuous distribution into a histogram with bin size @xmath136 leads to non - gaussianity at least on scale @xmath136 .",
    "many selection effects actually are some kind of sampling , and therefore , they will also give rise to non - gaussianity .",
    "all these non - gaussianities are  spurious \" .",
    "fortunately , in most cases these spurious non - gaussian signals are significant only at one special scale . for a poisson process , it is the scale of the mean distance of nearest neighbor clouds . for binning ,",
    "it is @xmath136 . on scales larger than @xmath136",
    ", the spurious non - gaussianities will decay out .",
    "that is , the scale - dependent behavior of sampling and binning is useful in recognizing spurious non - gaussianity . in the case of the ly@xmath0 forests ,",
    "the mean nearest neighbor distance along with the binning scale @xmath136 are much less than the scales of the detected non - gaussianities , and therefore , the detected non - gaussianities are inherent to the distributions .",
    "there is also evidence for intrinsic scales in the ly@xmath0 spectra of magnitude @xmath5 25 h@xmath1 mpc ( rauch 1998 ) .",
    "however this contamination can be reduced by studying @xmath80 and @xmath79 on scales different from 25 h@xmath1 mpc .",
    "nevertheless , high - resolution samples which can cover the spatial range as l arge as 80 h@xmath1 mpc are needed before a final determination can be made . recently",
    "a scale - scale correlation analysis also shows a non - gaussianity in the ly@xmath0 line distribution on such large scales ( pando et al .",
    "it seems to support our conclusion that cosmic matter underwent a non - gaussian process on quite large scales at quite early times .",
    "last but not least , the numerical work of calculating dwt higher order moment spectrum is not any more difficult than calculating the second order moments . generally , the calculation of third and higher order correlation functions of large scale structure samples is very strenuous work .",
    "but the numerical work involved in calculating the dwt is about the same as the fft , and can even be faster .",
    "the fft requires @xmath5 n log n calculations , while the dwt , using a  pyramid \" scheme , requires only order n calculations ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "this method can easily be generalized to 2- and 3-dimensions .",
    "the kurtosis and skewness spectrum opens a new window for looking at the statistical features of large scale structures .",
    "it is an important and necessary addition to the existing methods of describing the clustering and correlation of the cosmic density field , and for discriminating among models of structure formation .",
    "both authors wish to acknowledge the debt owed to the late professor p. carruthers who initiated the dwt study in our group .",
    "he will be sorely missed by us both .",
    "we also thank to drs .",
