    "since its discovery in 1998 @xcite , the cosmic acceleration has become one of the central problems in theoretical physics and cosmology . the most common approach to explain the cosmic acceleration is modifying the right hand side of einstein equation , i.e. , introducing a mysterious composition called dark energy ( de ) @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical de models have been proposed in the last decade @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , while it is still as daunting as ever to understand the nature of the cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "in addition to the introduction of the de component , another popular route to explain the cosmic acceleration , i.e. , modifying the left hand side of einstein equation , has also drawn a lot of attentions .",
    "they are the so - called modified gravity ( mg ) models @xcite .",
    "so far , a lot of mg models have been proposed , providing various interesting mechanisms for the cosmic acceleration . for example , in the dgp braneworld model @xcite , gravity is altered at immense distances by slow leakage of gravity off from our three - dimensional universe , leading to the apparent acceleration in the cosmological scale . in the @xmath0 gravity @xcite ,",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath4 is generalized to a function @xmath0 , providing another possible mechanism for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "a similar idea is the @xmath1 gravity @xcite , where the torsion @xmath5 is replaced by a function @xmath1 .",
    "other popular mg models include mond @xcite , teves @xcite , brans - dicke gravity @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , and so on @xcite . for recent reviews about mg models ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two ways to constrain the cosmological models by using the observational data .",
    "first , they can be tested through their effects in the cosmic expansion history , which can be measured through type ia supernoave ( snia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , and so on .",
    "second , they can be tested through their effects in the cosmic growth history , which can be measured through the integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite , weak lensing , galaxy clusters , and so on . so far , many studies have been performed @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will mainly test the mg models against the observations of the cosmic expansion history .",
    "recently , a high - quality joint sample of 472 supernovae ( sn ) , the snls3 snia dataset @xcite , was released .",
    "moreover , the systematic uncertainties of the snia data were nicely handled in work @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the performance of mg models when confronted with this newly released snia dataset .",
    "thus , in this paper we will adopt snls3 dataset and systematically study 5 representative mg models , including dgp model , two @xmath0 models , and two @xmath1 models . to perform a comprehensive analysis",
    ", we also include the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-yr ( wmap7 ) observations @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) @xcite , and the latest hubble constant measurement from the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hst @xcite . utilizing these data",
    ", we constrain the parameter space of these mg models , and compare them with the @xmath2cdm model by using the aic @xcite and bic @xcite criterion .    an important tool to study the cosmic growth history is growth factor @xcite .",
    "however , compared with the cosmic expansion history data , the current growth factor observations have larger errors ( their redshifts are also not well determined ) . moreover , some data points of growth factor observations are obtained by assuming @xmath2cdm , and therefore their use to test models different from @xmath2cdm may not be reliable .",
    "so in this work we will not include the growth factor data when performing observational constraints on the mg models . instead",
    ", making use of the constraints on the mg models obtained from the observations of the cosmic expansion history , we reconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor along with the redshift @xmath6 in these models and compare the results with the growth factor data . in this way",
    ", we can see whether it is possible to distinguish these mg models from the growth factor data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give a brief and overall description on the models considered here , as well as the analysis methods used . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce in detail the current observational data of the cosmic expansion history and the cosmic growth history , respectively . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the cosmological interpretations of the mg models considered here and give a summary of these models by making a comparison among them . in sec .",
    "v , we give a short discussion .",
    "in addition , we present two appendixes about the initial condition of evolution equation of growth factor and the effects of the parameter @xmath7 in @xmath0 model . in this work , we assume today s scale factor @xmath8 , so the redshift @xmath9 ; the subscript `` 0 '' always indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity , and the unit with @xmath10 is used .",
    "in this work , we will investigate 5 representative mg models , including    \\1 .",
    "the dgp model    \\2 .",
    "a power - law type @xmath1 model ( @xmath11 )    \\3 .",
    "an exponential type @xmath1 model ( @xmath12 )    \\4 .",
    "the @xmath0 model proposed by starobinsky ( @xmath13 )    \\5 . the @xmath0 model proposed by hu and sawicki ( @xmath14 )",
    "the dgp model is a braneworld model @xcite , where gravity is altered at immense distances by slow leakage of gravity off from our three - dimensional universe . in the @xmath1 models , the torsion @xmath5 in the lagrangian density",
    "is replaced by a generalized function @xmath15 . in this work ,",
    "we consider two @xmath1 models , in which the functions @xmath1 are of power - law type @xcite ( hereafter @xmath11 model ) and exponential type @xcite ( hereafter @xmath12 model ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath0 models , the ricci scalar @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath16 , and we will investigate the two popular @xmath0 models proposed by starobinsky @xcite ( hereafter @xmath13 model ) and by hu and sawicki @xcite ( hereafter @xmath14 model ) , respectively",
    ". we will give a detailed introduction about the formulas of these models in sec .",
    "iv .      to study the cosmological interpretations of the models listed in the previous subsection",
    ", we have to make use of the data from the recent cosmological observations . in practice",
    ", theoretical models and observational data can be related through the @xmath17 statistic . for a physical quantity",
    "@xmath18 with experimentally measured value @xmath19 , standard deviation @xmath20 and theoretically predicted value @xmath21 , the @xmath17 takes the form @xmath22 in case that there are more than one independent physical quantities , one can construct total @xmath17 by simply summing up all the @xmath23s , i.e. , @xmath24 in the following subsections , we will present the detailed forms of the @xmath17 function of the cosmological observations considered in this work .",
    "once having got the @xmath17 function , one can determine not only the best - fit model parameters but also the 1@xmath25 and the 2@xmath25 confidence level ( cl ) ranges of the model considered by minimizing the total @xmath17 and calculating @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "this need a thorough exploration of the parameter space of the @xmath17 function .",
    "this procedure is commonly accomplished through the monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) technique . in this work ,",
    "we make use of the publicly available cosmomc package @xcite and generate @xmath27 samples for each set of results presented in this paper .",
    "a statistical variable must be chosen to enforce a comparison between different models .",
    "the @xmath28 may be the simplest one , but it is difficult to compare models with different number of parameters .",
    "thus , in this work we use the commonly used aic and bic as model selection criterions .",
    "the information criteria ( ic ) is the most frequently used method to assess different models .",
    "it is also based on a likelihood method . in this paper",
    ", we use the akaike information criterion ( aic ) @xcite and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite as model selection criteria .",
    "these criteria favor models that have fewer parameters while giving a same fit , and have been applied frequently in the cosmological contexts @xcite .",
    "the aic @xcite is defined as @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the maximum likelihood and @xmath31 denote the number of free model parameters .",
    "note that for gaussian errors , @xmath30 is related to the @xmath32 by @xmath33 so the difference in aic can be simplified to @xmath34 . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a version of the aic corrected for small sample sizes , @xmath35 , which is important for @xmath36 . in our case",
    ", this correction is negligible .",
    "the bic , also known as the schwarz information criterion @xcite , is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of data .",
    "also , in this case , the absolute value of the criterion is not of interest , only the relative value between different models , @xmath39 , is useful .",
    "it should be mentioned that the aic is more lenient than bic on models with extra parameters for any likely data set @xmath40",
    ". generally speaking , a difference of 2 in bic ( @xmath41 ) is considered as positive evidence against the model with the higher bic , while a @xmath41 of 6 is considered as strong evidence .",
    "it should be noted that the ic alone can only imply that a more complex model is not necessary to explain the data , since a poor information criterion result might arise from the fact that the current data are too limited to constrain the extra parameters in this complex model , and it might become preferred with the future data .",
    "thus , this only reflects the _ current situation _ for the theoretical models .",
    "in this section , firstly , we will introduce in detail the observational data of the cosmic expansion history , and then we will present the observational data of the cosmic growth history .      in this paper , we will constrain the mg models by using the observational data of the cosmic expansion history , including the recently released snls3 snia sample @xcite , the cmb anisotropy data from the wmap7 observations @xcite , the bao results from the sdss dr7 @xcite , and the latest hubble constant measurement utilizing the wfc3 on the hst @xcite . in the following , we will include these observations into the @xmath17 analysis .",
    "a most powerful probe of the cosmic acceleration is type ia supernovae ( snia ) , which are used as cosmological standard candles to directly measure the cosmic expansion .",
    "recently , a high - quality joint sample of 472 supernovae ( sn ) , the snls3 snia dataset @xcite , was released .",
    "this sample includes 242 sn at @xmath42 from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) 3-yr observations @xcite , 123 sn at low redshifts @xcite@xcite , 93 sn at intermediate redshifts from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)-ii sn search @xcite , and 14 sn at @xmath43 from hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "this snia sample has been used to probe properties of de @xcite@xcite@xcite , to constrain the cosmological parameters @xcite , and to test the cosmological models @xcite .",
    "here , we briefly discuss the @xmath17 function of the snls3 snia data , which can be downloaded from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 function of the snls3 snia dataset takes the form @xmath44 where * c * is a @xmath45 covariance matrix capturing the statistic and systematic uncertainties of the snia sample , and @xmath46 is a vector of model residuals of the snia sample . here",
    "@xmath47 is the rest - frame peak @xmath48 band magnitude of the snia , and @xmath49 is the predicted magnitude of the snia given by the cosmological model and two other quantities ( stretch and color ) describing the light - curve of the particular snia .",
    "the model magnitude @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the hubble - constant free luminosity distance . in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ( the assumption of flatness",
    "is motivated by the inflation scenario ) , it takes the form @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the cmb frame and heliocentric redshifts of the sn , @xmath55 is the stretch measure for the sn , and @xmath56 is the color measure for the sn .",
    "@xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the hubble parameter . notice that different model will give different @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are nuisance parameters which characterize the stretch - luminosity and color - luminosity relationships , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we treat @xmath60 and @xmath61 as free parameters and let them run freely .    the quantity @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ snchisq ] ) is a nuisance parameter representing some combination of the absolute magnitude of a fiducial snia and the hubble constant . in this work ,",
    "we marginalize @xmath62 following the complicated formula in appendix c of @xcite .",
    "this procedure includes the host - galaxy information @xcite in the cosmological fits by splitting the samples into two parts and allowing the absolute magnitude to be different between these two parts .    the total covariance matrix * c * in eq .",
    "( [ snchisq ] ) captures both the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the snia data .",
    "one can decompose it as @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the purely diagonal part of the statistical uncertainties , @xmath65 is the off - diagonal part of the statistical uncertainties , and @xmath66 is the part capturing the systematic uncertainties . it should be mentioned that , for different @xmath60 and @xmath61 , these covariance matrices are also different .",
    "therefore , in practice one has to reconstruct the covariance matrix @xmath67 for the corresponding values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and calculate its inversion . for simplicity",
    ", we do not describe these covariance matrices one by one .",
    "one can refer to the original paper @xcite and the public code @xcite for more details about the explicit forms of the covariance matrices and the details of the calculation of @xmath68 .",
    "then we turn to the cmb observational data .",
    "we use the `` wmap distance priors '' given by the 7-yr wmap observations @xcite .",
    "the distance priors include the `` acoustic scale '' @xmath69 , the `` shift parameter '' @xmath4 , and the redshift of the decoupling epoch of photons @xmath70 .",
    "the acoustic scale @xmath69 , which represents the cmb multipole corresponding to the location of the acoustic peak , is defined as @xcite @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the proper angular diameter distance , given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the comoving sound horizon size , given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the present baryon and photon density parameters , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the best - fit values , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( for @xmath80 k ) , given by the 7-yr wmap observations @xcite . here",
    "@xmath81 is the reduced hubble parameter satisfying @xmath82 .",
    "the fitting function of @xmath70 was proposed by hu and sugiyama @xcite : @xmath83[1+g_1(\\omega_{m0 } h^2)^{g_2}],\\ ] ] where @xmath84 in addition , the shift parameter @xmath4 is defined as @xcite @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the present fractional matter density .    as shown in @xcite , the @xmath17 of the cmb data",
    "is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a vector , and @xmath89 is the inverse covariance matrix .",
    "the 7-yr wmap observations @xcite had given the maximum likelihood values : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . the inverse covariance matrix was also given in @xcite @xmath93      next we consider the bao observational data .",
    "we use the distance measures from the sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "one effective distance measure is the @xmath94 , which can be obtained from the spherical average @xcite @xmath95^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the proper angular diameter distance . in this work",
    "we use two quantities @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the expression of @xmath98 is given in eq.([eq : rs ] ) , and @xmath99 denotes the redshift of the drag epoch , whose fitting formula is proposed by eisenstein and hu @xcite @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 , \\\\ b_2 & = & 0.238(\\omega_{m0}h^2)^{0.223}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following @xcite , we write the @xmath17 for the bao data as , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and the inverse covariance matrix takes the form @xmath104      we also use the prior on the hubble constant @xmath105 .",
    "the precise measurements of @xmath105 will be helpful to break the degeneracy between it and the de parameters @xcite . when combined with the cmb measurement",
    ", it can lead to precise measurement of the de eos @xmath106 @xcite . recently , using the wfc3 on the hst , riess _",
    "_ obtained an accurate determination of the hubble constant @xcite @xmath107 corresponding to a @xmath108 uncertainty .",
    "so the @xmath17 of the hubble constant data is @xmath109      since the snia , cmb , bao and @xmath105 are effectively independent measurements , we can combine them by simply adding together the @xmath17 functions , i.e. , @xmath110      as mentioned above , growth factor is an important tool to study the cosmic growth history . in the following , we will give a brief introduction to the growth factor .",
    "as shown in @xcite , in the subhorizon limit , the evolution equation of the matter density perturbation of mg theory has the following form , @xmath111 where@xmath112 , @xmath113 is the matter energy density and @xmath114 is the effective newton s constant .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath114 for the mg models considered in this paper will be given in sec.[modelsresults ] .",
    "the growth factor @xmath115 is defined as @xmath116 thus , eq.([eq : deltarho ] ) becomes @xmath117 to solve eq.([eq : deltagf ] ) numerically , the initial condition is taken as @xmath118 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "notice that different models correspond to different @xmath58 and @xmath114 , and thus give different @xmath119 .",
    "we will make use of this equation to determine the predicted evolution history of the growth factor in mg models .    to test the theoretical prediction of growth factor obtained from eq.([eq : deltagf ] ) , it may be helpful to consider the current growth factor data @xcite , which are summarized and listed in the table [ gfdata ] .",
    "compared with the cosmic expansion history data , the current growth factor observations have larger errors , and their redshifts are also not well determined . moreover , as pointed out in @xcite , some data points of table [ gfdata ] are obtained by assuming @xmath2cdm when converting redshifts to distances for the power spectra , and therefore it may be unreliable to use them in the models different from @xmath2cdm .",
    "so in this work , we will not include the growth factor data in our @xmath17 analysis . instead , by using the constraints obtained from the cosmic expansion history data",
    ", we will explore the evolutions of these models growth factor along with redshift @xmath6 , and compare the results with the growth factor data .",
    ".the combined observational data on the growth factor @xmath115 . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     note : the nuisance parameters @xmath81 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 used in the analysis are actually not model parameters with significant meanings , so we do not list them in this table .    to make a comparison , we also list the case of the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "as shown in the table [ sumofresults ] , the values of @xmath120aic and the @xmath120bic of dgp model are both quite lager than 6 .",
    "this means that the dgp model is strongly disfavored by the data .",
    "other mg models do not yield to remarkable reductions of the @xmath3 , and give slightly larger aic and bic values compared with the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath2cdm model is still more favored by the current data .",
    "this result is consistent with some previous works @xcite .",
    "in this work , we test 5 mg models by using the current cosmological observations . utilizing the observational data of the cosmic expansion history , including the recently released snls3 type ia supernovae sample , the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the wmap7 observations , the baryon acoustic oscillation results from the sdss dr7 and the latest hubble constant measurement utilizing the wfc3 on the hst , we constrain the parameter spaces of these models .",
    "then , by plotting the evolutions of these models growth factor , we further compare the theoretical predictions of these mg models with the current growth factor data .",
    "it is found that these mg models do not lead to appreciable reductions of the @xmath3 , and give larger aic and bic values compared with the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "in addition , based on the current growth factor data , these mg models are difficult to be distinguished from the @xmath2cdm model , so further growth factor data is needed .",
    "this work was supported by the nsfc grant no.10535060/a050207 , a nsfc group grant no.10821504 .",
    "qgh was also supported by the project of knowledge innovation program of chinese academy of science and a grant from nsfc ( grant no .",
    "10975167 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we explain the reason of taking initial conditions @xmath118 when solving the eq([eq : deltagf ] ) numerically .    starting from eq.([eq : deltarho ] ) and changing variables from @xmath121 to @xmath122",
    ", one can obtain @xmath123 to solve this equation numerically , we take the initial condition at high-@xmath6 era , e.g. @xmath124 here , since @xmath125 is satisfied precisely at high-@xmath6 era for all models considered in this paper .    in addition , in the high-@xmath6 regime , the universe is at the matter - dominated stage , thus we have the friedmann equation : @xmath126    then , eq.([eq : delt - rho - a ] ) becomes @xmath127    assuming the solution of the above equation takes the form @xmath128 , and then substituting this form into eq.([eq : delt - rho - a2 ] ) , one finally gets the function s general solution @xmath129    since @xmath130 is quite small in high-@xmath6 regime , the acceptable solution is @xmath131    thus , we finally obtain the initial condition of eq.([eq : deltagf ] ) @xmath132 at redshift @xmath124 .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the effects of @xmath7 on the cosmological interpretations of the @xmath0 models are rather small .",
    "let us consider the @xmath14 model .",
    "the best - fit values of the cosmological parameters @xmath86 and @xmath81 , their @xmath133 and @xmath134 confidence region , and the corresponding @xmath135 can be obtained from the joint analysis of the snls3+cmb+bao+@xmath105 data . when we take @xmath136 , we find the following results , @xmath137 while @xmath138 yields to @xmath139 clearly , the above two sets of results are very close to each other .     the evolutions of @xmath119 predicted by the @xmath2cdm and @xmath14 models in the cases of @xmath136 and @xmath138 respectively .",

    "that is , the effects of @xmath7 on the cosmological interpretations of the @xmath14 model are rather small . in the @xmath13 model ,",
    "the result is similar .",

    "<S> we explore the cosmological implications of five modified gravity ( mg ) models by using the recent cosmological observational data , including the recently released snls3 type ia supernovae sample , the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7-yr observations , the baryon acoustic oscillation results from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 , and the latest hubble constant measurement utilizing the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the mg models considered include the dvali - gabadadze - porrati(dgp ) model , two @xmath0 models , and two @xmath1 models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that compared with the @xmath2cdm model , mg models can not lead to a appreciable reduction of the @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of aic and bic shows that the simplest cosmological constant model ( @xmath2cdm ) is still most preferred by the current data , and the dgp model is strongly disfavored . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from the observational constraints , we also reconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor in these models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the current available growth factor data are not enough to distinguish these mg models from the @xmath2cdm model .    </S>",
    "<S> * keywords : * modified gravity , cosmic acceleration , dark energy experiment , growth factor . </S>"
