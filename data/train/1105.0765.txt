    "recently , hoava proposed a renormalizable field theoretical model which can be interpreted as a complete theory of gravity horava:2008ih , horava:2009uw . in the infrared ( ir ) energy scales ,",
    "the theory reduces to einstein gravity with a nonvanishing cosmological constant .",
    "however , in the ultraviolet ( uv ) energy scales , the theory exhibits an anisotropic lifshitz scaling between time and space given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scaling exponent . due to the latter anisotropic scaling the model",
    "is denoted hoava - lifshitz gravity in the literature .",
    "taking into account these novel features , hoava - lifshitz gravity has received a tremendous amount of attention . as the literature is rather extensive ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a recent status of the theory .",
    "in addition to the formal issues , applications have been extensively explored , ranging from cosmology , dark energy , dark matter to spherically symmetric or rotating solutions .",
    "in fact , several versions of hoava gravity have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the relevant version for cosmology was the introduction of an ir modification term containing an arbitrary cosmological constant , representing the analogs of the standard schwarzschild-(anti ) de sitter solutions , which were absent in the original hoava model . in this context",
    ", ir - modified hoava gravity seems to be consistent with the current observational data @xcite , but in order to test its viability more observational constraints are necessary .    in this work",
    ", we discuss the position of images formed in gravitational lensing by the kehagias - sfetsos asymptotically flat space - time kehagias:2009is in the framework of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "note that gravitational lensing has become a useful tool in measuring certain properties of gravitational fields and it has now been employed to study the large scale structure of the universe , to determine behavior of compact stellar objects and to search for dark matter candidates . in what follows we advocate the idea that gravitational lensing might also be used to discriminate which of the various gravitational theories is correct .",
    "indeed , this approach was followed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of 5-dimensional brane - world theories .",
    "in particular , by computing the bending angles and image brightness changes that occur due to the passage of photons past lensing object were determined to distinguish a general relativistic black hole from the black holes predicted by an alternative theory .",
    "we follow the approach proposed in @xcite , where under some physically realistic assumptions , a simple lens equation was obtained that allows arbitrary small as well as large light deflection angles .",
    "this lens equation has been widely used in the literature for studying strong field gravitational lensing .",
    "in fact , in the last few years there has been a growing interest in studying weak as well as strong field lensing by a wide plethora of compact objects ( we refer the reader to ref .",
