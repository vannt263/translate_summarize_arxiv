    "statistical mechanics models with short range interactions have a free energy per unit volume which is independent of boundary conditions .",
    "the six - vertex model seems to be an exception , at first glance . if one imposes domain wall boundary conditions ( dwbc ) , the free energy differs from the one with periodic boundary conditions even in the infinite volume limit @xcite .    to explain more precisely we recall the six allowed vertices and their weight , see figure  [ figweights ] . for better visualization only ne and se",
    "oriented lines are drawn .",
    "the reason for the rotation by @xmath0 , as compared to the usual arrows on @xmath1 , will become apparent later .",
    "we want to think of the vertices in figure  [ figweights ] as tiles and the equilibrium statistical mechanics as a tiling problem .",
    "let us then consider a domain @xmath2 and prescribe the tiles along its boundary @xmath3 , for an example see figure  [ figdwbcaztec](a ) .",
    "an admissible tiling is such that the lines are never broken and start , resp .",
    "end , only at the boundary @xmath3 . in this language ,",
    "dwbc correspond to a square - shaped domain such that the lines start regularly spaced at the sw edge and end regularly spaced at the se edge , as in figure  [ figdwbcaztec](a ) .",
    "the corresponding free energy is computed in @xcite , for finite size corrections see @xcite .",
    "[ c]@xmath4 [ c]@xmath5 [ c]@xmath6 [ c]@xmath7 [ c]@xmath8 [ c]@xmath9     in the context of dwbc it has been noted that the six - vertex model maps to another , very widely studied tiling problem , namely the aztec diamond , see figure  [ figdwbcaztec](b ) .",
    "there one has given a diamond shaped domain in @xmath1 of size @xmath10 , which has to be tiled with @xmath11 , resp .",
    "@xmath12 , dominos .",
    "if every allowed tiling has equal weight , for large @xmath13 there is a central disordered zone of linear size @xmath13 , which is bordered by four regular zones also of linear size @xmath13 and located at the four corners  @xcite .",
    "thus the limit state for @xmath14 `` phase '' segregates .",
    "in contrast , for periodic boundary conditions the system is homogeneously disordered , which physically is the reason behind the boundary dependent free energies .    the aztec diamond has been analyzed in great detail by means of determinantal processes .",
    "in particular one knows the precise statistics of the line dividing the ordered from the disordered zone @xcite .",
    "the determinantal property suggests that equal weight in the domino tiling corresponds to the dwbc six - vertex model at its free fermion point .",
    "the aim of our contribution is to study the correspondence between domino tilings and the six - vertex model for general domains and boundary conditions , of course including dwbc , on the level of the complete statistics . with this information one",
    "readily translates the known statistical properties of the aztec diamond to the dwbc six - vertex model at its free fermion point .    to give an outline",
    ": we introduce the domino tiling and the general six - vertex model for arbitrary domains and boundary conditions .",
    "we explain the lindstrm - gessel - viennot ( lgv ) scheme for nonintersecting paths on directed graphs and show in which sense the six - vertex model at the free fermion point is a special case of the general lgv set - up .",
    "thereby we achieve directly the one - to - many mapping from six - vertex tilings to domino tilings .",
    "in the usual set - up , at every vertex there are two incoming and two outgoing arrows ( the so - called _ ice rule _ ) .",
    "thereby one obtains six distinct vertices with boltzmann weights @xmath15 , see figure  [ figweights ] .",
    "equivalently , one may think of a tiling problem with six distinct tiles by drawing only the north - east and the south - east arrows .",
    "a six - vertex configuration consists in a tiling such that the arrows of the vertices match amongst themselves and with the arrows prescribed at the boundary of the domain . in terms of the lines of figure  [ figweights ] , each configuration of the six - vertex model can be represented by a set of continuous lines which necessarily end at the boundary of the domain .    in this paper",
    "we mainly consider the case where the boundary is a rectangle .",
    "later , we also discuss more general boundary conditions .",
    "so , let the border of the region we want to tile be a rectangle @xmath16 composed by segments @xmath17 between sites of @xmath1 , see figure  [ figdwbcaztec](a ) .",
    "the tiled region @xmath2 is the one enclosed by the rectangle @xmath16 .",
    "define the set @xmath18 , i.e. , the mid - points of the basic segments forming the rectangle @xmath16 .",
    "_ fixed boundary conditions _ means to define the points of @xmath3 which are start- , resp .",
    "end - points of a line . in figure",
    "[ figdwbcaztec](a ) the start points are the white dots , the end points the black ones .",
    "these points are on sides which can be oriented in four different directions as defined by the direction of the outer normal vector .",
    "the white dots lie on the sw or nw sides of @xmath2 , the black ones on the se or ne sides .",
    "the six - vertex model with fixed boundary conditions has _ two free parameters_. every elementary tile contains up to 2 line segments of length @xmath19 in either the ne ( @xmath20 ) or se ( @xmath21 ) direction .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the number of vertices of type @xmath23 ( the ones with weight @xmath24 ) in a given configuration .",

    "@xmath27 , 3 .",
    "@xmath28 , 4 .",
    "@xmath29 .",
    "the first equation says that the total number of vertices is fixed by @xmath2 .",
    "the second and third equation are a direct consequence of the fact that the start- and end - points are fixed .",
    "finally , the fourth equation holds because given a possible set of lines , one can find any other set of lines by a subsequent shift of the corners @xmath30 and @xmath31 . during this procedure",
    "it is not possible to increase ( or decrease ) the number of @xmath31 by one without forcing the same change to the number of @xmath30 .",
    "the weight of a configuration is @xmath32 and by using the above relations it can be rewritten as @xmath33 with @xmath34 , , and .",
    "therefore , w.l.o.g . , we can set @xmath35 and keep @xmath5 , @xmath8 as _ free internal parameters_. this choice turns out to be convenient for the mapping .    to a tiling",
    "one can associate a height function on @xmath2 as follows . fix a reference height equal to zero at some point on @xmath36 .",
    "the height along the loop @xmath16 is increased ( resp .",
    "decreased ) by one unit when a white or black dot on @xmath3 is crossed while going to ne or nw direction ( resp .",
    "se or sw ) . inside @xmath2",
    "the lines of the tiling are the boundaries of domains with the same height . in computing the surface free - energy , there are four free parameters since two are internal parameters and two correspond to chemical potentials determining the average slope , in accordance with our previous argument .    in the parameter space of the six - vertex model",
    "there is a codimension one manifold which is determined by the equation @xmath37 and is called _ free - fermion point_. therefore , in case of fixed boundary conditions , there is only a single internal free parameter . let us set @xmath38    the terminology `` free - fermion '' refers to a transfer matrix which is the exponential of a quadratic fermion hamiltonian .",
    "this roughly corresponds to line ensembles on a graph conditioned to be non - intersecting ( no points in common ) .",
    "if we set @xmath39 , thus @xmath40 , then the free - fermion condition ( [ eqfreefermion ] ) is automatically satisfied , and the corresponding line ensemble fits straightforwardly into the so - called lindstrm - gessel - viennot ( lgv ) scheme to be explained below . for the case",
    "@xmath41 this is no longer the case and brak and owczarek  @xcite approach the problem by introducing `` osculating paths '' .",
    "actually , this is not needed and , as we will explain , the general free - fermion case can still be represented in a simple lgv scheme .",
    "a graph closely related to the one presented here appears also in the domino tiling of a checkerboard region .",
    "a particular example is the aztec diamond  @xcite .",
    "the aztec diamond consists in a diamond - shaped region @xmath42 , see figure  [ figdwbcaztec](b ) .",

    "let @xmath62 be the number of dominos of type @xmath63 in a configuration of the aztec diamond .",
    "then there are 3 equations reducing the free parameters from 4 to 1 , namely @xmath64 therefore the aztec diamond has only one free - parameter . for easy comparison with the 6-vertex model , we set the weights of the dominos as follows @xmath65    to each configuration of the aztec diamond one can associate a non - intersecting set of lines .",
    "this is obtained by replacing the 4 types of dominos in the first row of figure  [ figdominos ] with the lines as in the second row of the same illustration . as we will see in the next section , such line ensembles",
    "can also be associated to the 6-vertex model at its free - fermion point .",
    "let us first recall the lindstrm - gessel - viennot scheme , see  @xcite for details , and then apply it to the free - fermion six - vertex model .",
    "gessel and viennot start with a graph @xmath66 consisting of vertices @xmath67 and directed edges @xmath55 .",

    "thereby , the weights @xmath24 s are as required , see also figure  [ figlgvmap ] .",
    "in fact , the only correspondence which is not one - to - one is for the weight @xmath86 because there are two possible paths , one passing by the center of the cell of weight @xmath46 and the second following the edge with weight @xmath61 .",

    "more precisely , to 6-vertex configurations with @xmath92 vertices of type 5 , there are @xmath93 different lgv line configurations",
    ". however , these are only local modifications of each other and any observable not distinguishing the precise path inside an elementary cell remains unaffected .",
    "the connection between the six - vertex model and domino tilings can be seen most directly in terms of line ensembles .",

    "fixed boundary condition _ for the six - vertex model on @xmath3 , we associate the fixed boundary conditions for domino tiling , i.e. , we define the domain @xmath42 to be tiled with dominos and the height along the boundary @xmath43 .",
    "the idea is that the graph lgv supporting the non - intersecting lines remains , up to _ deterministic _ local modifications , unchanged by the mapping to domino tilings .",
    "the lgv graph on the black and white sites of the domino tiling are        the region tiled by the six - vertex model and the one of the domino tiling can not be identical .",
    "we have to decide whether the squares centered at the boundary @xmath3 are to be tiled or not .",

    "the start and end points of the line ensembles are moved accordingly .",
    "the lgv graph constructed in this way differs from the 6-vertex one by extra half - diagonal pieces added ( @xmath108 ) or removed ( @xmath109 ) which have unit weight .",
    "the other differences between the lgv graphs consists only in edges which , due to the boundary conditions , can not be visited by the lines ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "therefore the allowed line configurations are in one - to - one correspondence and have the same weight .",

    "this mapping between line ensembles can be easily inverted .      above",
    "we only established the mapping from the six - vertex model in a rectangular region @xmath2 to a domino tiling .",
    "however the construction holds for general domains provided the following four boundary configurations do not appear .",
    "the reason is that the above configurations are mapped into        and the natural boundary of the tiling no longer coincides with the dashed line .",
    "the top lgv line of the aztec diamond borders , up to errors of size @xmath46 , the north polar region , i.e. , the region containing only north - type dominos which is connected with the north border of the aztec diamond . for size @xmath13 , let us denote the top lgv line by @xmath111 , @xmath112 $ ] ( with the axis origin as in figure  [ figdwbcaztec](b ) ) .",
    "it follows immediately from the results by johansson  @xcite that @xmath111 properly rescaled has limit as a random function .",

    "of course , the scaling coefficients will change , but the scaling exponent and scaling function remain the same .    the result ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) transcribes to the six - vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions . in the geometry of figure  [ figdwbcazteclines ]",
    "we may consider the outermost six - vertex line denoted by @xmath118 .",
    "it borders the region tiled errorless with tiles of type @xmath46 . clearly , for all @xmath119 and @xmath13 , one has @xmath120 therefore the limit ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) holds also for the free - fermion six - vertex model",
    ".    the reader might be curious to know about the properties of the outermost line once the free fermion condition is no longer satisfied .",
    "for easier comparison with the literature , we switch to the standard parametrization @xmath121 with @xmath122 and exploiting the normalization of the weight we can set @xmath123 . if figure  [ figphasediag ] we display the bulk phase diagram for periodic boundary conditions and zero electric fields  @xcite . for dwbc one",

    "there are then the perfectly ordered zones at the four corners with tiles @xmath133 counted clockwise starting from the top and a random zone which touches the border of the quadrant at four points .",
    "presumably the macroscopic height profile satisfies the pokrovsky - talapov law , which is a strong indication that the outermost line is still governed by the airy process ( see  @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "as one crosses to the anti - ferroelectric phase , @xmath128 , the structure of the outer configurations does not change qualitatively .",
    "however , the macroscopic height profile develops a facet at the center which consists of a regular arrangements of tiles @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the ordered zones at the corner , this facet allows for small statistical errors in the tiling .",
