    "the next decade promises to be a very exciting time for strong interaction physics . with ever increasing computer power and impressive progress in developing new techniques to simulate quantum field theories",
    ", one hopes that lattice simulations of simple hadronic systems will provide rigorous and reliable predictions of qcd for strong interaction observables . while one looks forward to fully - unquenched qcd simulations performed with the physical values of the light - quark masses , @xmath0 , such simulations are presently prohibitively time - consuming . at present , and for the foreseeable future , unphysical theories will be simulated because , in contrast with qcd , the simulations can be performed in a reasonable time frame  @xcite .",
    "a second motivation for simulating unphysical theories is particular to nuclear physics , and is related to the unnaturally large values of the s - wave scattering lengths .",
    "we will discuss this point in the final section of the paper .",
    "a commonly simulated unphysical theory is quenched qcd ( qqcd ) where disconnected quark - loop diagrams ( the quark determinant ) are omitted .",
    "while qqcd simulations of strong interaction observables can be performed with small @xmath0 , they have the distinct disadvantage of not being related to qcd except in the large-@xmath1 limit  @xcite .",
    "a more interesting unphysical theory is partially - quenched qcd ( pqqcd )  @xcite in which the quark masses , @xmath2 ( the `` @xmath3 '' stands for `` sea '' ) , used in evaluating the disconnected quark - loops are larger than the masses of the quarks connected to external sources , @xmath4 ( the `` v '' stands for `` valence '' ) . by computing strong interaction observables in pqqcd and performing the extrapolation @xmath5",
    "one recovers the qcd observables that one is interested in .",
    "it is for this last step the extrapolation to the physical values of @xmath0 that effective field theory ( eft ) is required .",
    "the eft s describing qcd in the low - momentum regime in the pseudo - goldstone boson sector ( chiral perturbation theory , @xmath6pt ) , and in the single baryon sector ( heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , hb@xmath6pt ) , are well established , and their extension to pqqcd in the form of pq@xmath6pt  @xcite and pqhb@xmath6pt  @xcite have been accomplished relatively recently .",
    "the construction of an eft to describe the low - momentum dynamics of multi - nucleon systems has proven to be extremely challenging . in the very low - momentum regime , where the typical momentum of the external particles involved in a given process is much less than the mass of the pion , @xmath7 , and hadronic production is therefore kinematically forbidden , an eft , @xmath8  @xcite , can be constructed from nucleons and photons ( and any other low - momentum transfer probes ) quite simply .",
    "the fact that there is a bound state near threshold in the @xmath9 coupled - channels , and a pole on the second - sheet near threshold in the @xmath10 channel means that at least one operator in the @xmath8 lagrange density must be treated non - perturbatively in these channels .",
    "the choice of operators to be resummed and details of the perturbative expansion are defined by the power - counting in @xmath8 . despite chiral symmetry not being a good symmetry for @xmath11 , isospin remains a good symmetry .",
    "the only input into the construction of @xmath8 is lorentz invariance , electromagnetic gauge invariance , baryon number conservation and the approximate isospin symmetry , the breaking of which can be included perturbatively . in the kinematic regime where the momenta involved in a given process",
    "are larger than @xmath12 , the pion must be included as a dynamical field .",
    "it was weinberg s pioneering efforts  @xcite in the early 1990 s in this kinematic regime that initiated interest in developing eft for nuclear physics .",
    "weinberg attempted to construct an eft for nuclear processes and nuclei involving momenta all the way up to the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath13 , and necessarily included the pion as a dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "the power - counting that he developed , known as weinberg power - counting ( w ) , involves a chiral expansion of the nucleon - nucleon potential using the same power - counting rules that are used in the meson and single nucleon sectors .",
    "the chirally expanded potential is inserted into the schrdinger equation to determine observables , such as phase shifts .",
    "unfortunately , there is a formal problem with this power counting  @xcite in some of the scattering channels , particularly the @xmath10 channel . however , extensive phenomenological studies with w power - counting appear to be in good agreement with data  @xcite , where such comparisons are possible , and the formal problems appear to have little impact when a massive regulator is used with a mass scale that is not radically different from a few hundred mev .",
    "the formal problems with w power - counting led kaplan , savage and wise ( ksw ) to develop a power - counting  @xcite in which the momentum - independent four - nucleon operator is promoted to one lower order in the chiral expansion , and consequently pion exchanges are subleading and treated in perturbation theory .",
    "this power - counting is formally consistent and gives renormalization group invariant amplitudes order - by - order in the eft expansion . however , fleming",
    ", mehen and stewart  @xcite ( fms ) showed that the scattering amplitude in the @xmath9 coupled channels diverges at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) at relatively small momenta and ksw power - counting fails .",
    "fms found that a contribution that remains large in the chiral limit destroys the convergence : it is the chiral limit of the tensor force that `` does the damage '' .",
    "recently , it was suggested that one should expand observables about the chiral limit  @xcite ( bbsvk power - counting ) .",
    "bbsvk power - counting has all the nice features of w and ksw counting : the chiral limit of the tensor force is resummed at leading order ( lo ) along with the momentum- and @xmath0-independent four - nucleon operator in the @xmath9 coupled channels , while pions are perturbative in the @xmath10 channel , and in higher partial waves , where analytic calculations are possible .    in recent work  @xcite",
    ", we showed that hairpin diagrams in pqqcd give rise to a component of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential that falls exponentially at long - distance and therefore does not have the yukawa behavior found in qcd .",
    "thus , measuring the long - distance behavior of the nn potential  @xcite does not provide information about qcd unless the hairpin contribution can be removed in a rigorous way . while the presence of this behavior is quite discouraging",
    ", one might focus on the behavior of s - matrix elements rather than on the nn potential itself ( for a recent survey of the status of lattice calculations of the nn potential see ref.@xcite ) . in this work",
    "we develop the partially - quenched eft that describes the two - nucleon sector using bbsvk power - counting . in channels with higher partial waves ,",
    "we give analytic expressions for scattering amplitudes and a few characteristic scattering volumes to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the partially - quenched eft . in the @xmath10-channel we give analytic expressions for the scattering amplitude , scattering length and effective range to nlo in terms of the valence and sea quark masses . as in qcd ,",
    "the @xmath9 coupled channels in the partially - quenched eft are somewhat more complicated ; we provide the nn potential at nlo that is required to generate the nn phase - shifts , @xmath14 and mixing - parameter , @xmath15 , by solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "in bbsvk power - counting s - matrix elements are an expansion about the chiral limit , where the expansion parameter , @xmath16 , is @xmath17 , where the constant @xmath18 is determined by the relative size of pion exchange , and @xmath12 is the physical value of the pion mass . in the two s - wave channels , the momentum and @xmath0-independent four - nucleon operators , along with the chiral limit of one - pseudo - goldstone - boson - exchange ( opgbe ) ,",
    "are resummed to all orders ( each iteration is the same order in @xmath16 ) and this sum constitutes the lo scattering amplitude . in the @xmath10-channel",
    "this corresponds to ksw power - counting and the scattering amplitude can be computed analytically , while in the @xmath9 coupled channels , the scattering amplitude must be determined numerically . in the higher partial waves ,",
    "the chiral limit of opgbe provides the lo contribution to the scattering amplitude as the four - nucleon operators are suppressed by additional powers of momentum .",
    "it is the ultra - violet ( uv ) behavior of the theory that requires an expansion about the chiral limit , and in particular allows control of the very singular diagrams as @xmath19 in coordinate - space .",
    "the deviations from the chiral limit in opgbe that formally occur at higher orders in bbsvk power - counting are uv safe and can therefore be included at nlo without compromising the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "the price for not including them is that the long - distance behavior of the theory must be recovered order - by - order in perturbation theory and convergence is somewhat slow  @xcite . by contrast , the two - pseudo - goldstone - boson - exchange ( tpgbe ) diagrams are singular away from the chiral limit , and therefore only the chiral limit can be retained at nlo ; keeping the full tpgbe introduces divergences that can not be renormalized at nlo . in this work we compute to nlo in the eft with bbsvk power - counting . in the s - wave channels at nlo",
    "there are contributions from opgbe ( the full meson mass dependence is retained ) , from momentum- and @xmath0-independent four - nucleon operators , from the leading momentum - dependent four - nucleon operators ( @xmath20 ) and from the four - nucleon operators with a single insertion of @xmath0 . in the higher partial waves ,",
    "the four - nucleon operators contribute beyond nlo and thus only opgbe contributes at nlo .",
    "we will work in the isospin limit of the @xmath21 pq@xmath6pt .",
    "this means that the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks in the valence and ghost sectors are degenerate and the @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks in the sea sector are degenerate .",

    "= 2.5 in    0.15 in    .2 in    at nlo in the partially - quenched eft there are potentially additional contributions from tpgbe . however , it is only the chiral limit of tpgbe that contributes at nlo and the chiral limit of pqqcd is the same as the chiral limit of qcd , by construction , and thus the tpgbe potentials are those given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpepots ] )  .",
    "thus , the additional contributions at nlo have the same form as in the @xmath10 channel : a single insertion of @xmath0 and the exchange of a single @xmath33 , as shown in fig .  [ fig:3s1pq ] , which generates the potentials given in eq  ( [ eq : pqpot ] ) .",
    "the additional contribution from a single insertion of @xmath0 leads to a modification of the short - distance potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potin ] ) .",
    "the short distance potential in the partially - quenched theory is @xmath161    this completes the construction of a partially - quenched eft describing the @xmath9 coupled channels .",
    "the potential defined above is inserted into the schrdinger equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) to generate observables . due to the lack of partially - quenched lattice data in this channel",
    "we have not generated phase - shifts or scattering lengths .",
    "however , this is a straightforward procedure and requires only limited numerical work  @xcite .",
    "in this work we have formulated the effective field theory required to describe the low - energy behavior of partially - quenched qcd in the two - nucleon sector .",
    "in fact , it is quite simple to construct the partially - quenched effective field theory from the known qcd results and it is gratifying to see that one can obtain analytic results for many observables in the @xmath10 channel and in the higher partial waves . while a numerical solution is required in the @xmath9 coupled channels , it amounts to a simple problem in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "one should be concerned about the range of sea and valence quark masses for which this theory converges . in qcd",
    "it is found that the nn eft converges for @xmath12 and momenta less than of order @xmath162 , and one suspects that the same radius of convergence will exist in the partially - quenched theory .",
    "if this is indeed the case , lattice calculations will be required with meson masses of less than @xmath163 in order to match to the eft and use it to make predictions about nature .",
    "this is somewhat more restrictive than in the meson and single nucleon sectors and therefore one would like to see convergent results in those sectors before being confident in results obtained in the multi - nucleon sectors .",
    "it is very encouraging to see that partially - quenched calculations of quantities in pq@xmath6pt describing the dynamics of the pgb s are presently being performed  @xcite , and linear combinations of the gasser - leutwyler coefficients appearing at @xmath164 in @xmath6pt are being determined as a result .",
    "the situation is far less advanced in the two - nucleon sector . at present",
    ", nn scattering lengths must be extracted at finite volume using lscher s formula , which expresses the energy of a two - particle state as a perturbative expansion in the scattering length divided by the size of the box  @xcite .",
    "there are ( at least ) two potential problems with this approach .",
    "first , one may worry that lack of unitarity in pqqcd may invalidate lscher s formula for the nn scattering lengths .",
    "however , lscher s formula is easily obtained in @xmath8  @xcite , and one can convince oneself using the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite that , while the pionful nn eft described above is not unitary in pqqcd , @xmath8 is unitary in pqqcd ; all the effects of partial - quenching in @xmath8 are in the coefficients of the contact operators .",
    "it follows by continuity that the nn scattering lengths can be extracted in a lattice simulation of pqqcd by using lscher s formula and extrapolating to the physical quark masses using the formalism presented in this paper .",
    "a second worry is truly cause for concern : the s - wave nn scattering lengths are extremely large ( which is understood as proximity to an infrared fixed point  @xcite ) as compared to the sizes of state - of - the - art lattices : @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "a recent study  @xcite of the pion - mass dependence of the nn scattering lengths in qcd suggest that the @xmath167 scattering length relaxes to        natural values of @xmath168 as the pion mass is increased beyond @xmath169 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1mqa ] ) .",
    "one anticipates similar behavior in the partially - quenched theory .",
    "given current uncertainties in strong interaction parameters , particularly @xmath170 , it is at present unclear whether the same is true in the @xmath10 channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0mq ] ) .    to our knowledge ,",
    "a single lattice determination of the @xmath10 and @xmath167 nn scattering lengths in qqcd exists  @xcite at a pion mass of @xmath171 .",
    "this pion mass is beyond the range of applicability of the eft described in this paper , or of an analogous eft that one can easily construct to describe qqcd . given the unknown @xmath172 coefficients that encode the short - distance quark - mass dependence in the s - wave channels one may question the motivation for an improved , partially - quenched simulation of the nn scattering lengths with pion masses within the nn eft , since such simulation will , at best , simply determine the @xmath172 operators .",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that to leading order in the nn eft , and assuming perfect knowledge of the single - nucleon sector , the @xmath172 operators determine the quark - mass dependence of the deuteron and , more generally , of dinucleon binding . since small changes in @xmath0",
    "can in principle lead to drastic changes in the positions of nuclear energy levels , much attention has been given to light - element abundances predicted by big - bang nucleonsynthesis and to the abundance of isotopes produced by the oklo `` natural reactor '' in the hope that these abundances can be used to constrain high - energy physics  @xcite .",
    "this is powerful motivation indeed for improved lattice simulations of nn scattering lengths .",
    "we look forward to a significant lattice effort in the multi - nucleon sector .",
