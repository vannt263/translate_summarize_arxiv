    "the study of the interactions between ultra cold atoms and surfaces is of major interest in the context of bose - einstein condensation on microchips  @xcite .",
    "one motivation is to understand the limitations on integrated matter wave devices due to imperfect surface fabrication or finite temperature .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the quality of the wires used in microfabricated chips is directly linked to the fragmentation effects observed in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped near a metallic wire @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations of the current in a metallic surface induce spin flip losses in an atomic cloud when the distance to the surface is smaller than @xmath0 m typically @xcite .",
    "dielectric surfaces and evanescent waves have also been explored for producing strong confinement .",
    "they have the advantage of a strong suppression of the spin flip loss mechanism compared to metallic structures @xcite .",
    "with such a system , one can realize mirrors @xcite , diffraction gratings @xcite , 2d traps @xcite or waveguides @xcite .",
    "experiments involving ultra cold atoms from a bec at the vicinity of a dielectric surface have recently made significant progress , leading for instance to the realization of a two dimensional bec @xcite , to the study of atom - surface reflection in the quantum regime @xcite , and to sensitive measurements of adsorbate - induced surface polarization @xcite and of the van der waals / casimir - polder surface interaction @xcite .    in this paper , we present experimental results and a related theoretical analysis of bose condensed rubidium atoms interacting with the light field of an evanescent wave above a dielectric slab .",
    "the evanescent wave is detuned to the blue of an atomic transition line and provides a mirror for a bec that is released from a trap and falls freely in the gravity field of the earth . after the bounce off the mirror",
    ", we observe a strong scattering of the atomic cloud ( diffuse mirror reflection ) that is due to the roughness of the slab surface where the evanescent wave is formed  @xcite . in our case , the phase front of the reflected matter waves is significantly distorted because the effective corrugation of the mirror is comparable to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the incident de broglie wavelength and @xmath3 the angle of incidence .",
    "this is similar to early experiments with evanescent waves @xcite and with magnetic mirrors @xcite .",
    "we mention that later experiments achived a significantly reduced diffuse reflection ( arnold @xcite ) and were even able to distinguish a specularly reflected matter wave ( savalli @xcite ) .",
    "the key result of our experiment is that we can quantitively confirm the theoretical analysis developed by henkel @xcite , combining independent measurements of the dielectric surface and the bouncing atoms .",
    "the paper starts with a presentation of the experiment and an analysis of the experimental results , following ref.@xcite .",
    "we then outline an improved theoretical analysis based on ref.@xcite and discuss the momentum distribution of the reflected atoms , in particular its diffuse spread and its isotropy .",
    "as the propagation axis of the evanescent wave along the surface , @xmath4 as the other horizontal axis and @xmath5 as the vertical one.,height=75 ]    the evanescent wave is produced by total internal reflection of a gaussian laser beam at the surface of a dielectric prism .",
    "as shown in fig.[prism ] , the surface of the prism is coated by two dielectric layers , a tio@xmath6 layer on top of a sio@xmath6 spacer layer .",
    "this coating forms an optical waveguide that resonantly enhances the evanescent field above the top layer  @xcite ; we have designed this configuration for the study of two - dimensional atom traps  @xcite .",
    "the incident angle of the laser beam is fixed by the resonance condition for a waveguide mode ; for the transverse electric ( or s ) polarization we use , the incident angle is @xmath7 ( at the tio@xmath6/vacuum interface , index @xmath8 ) .",
    "the resulting exponential decay length of the light field is @xmath9  nm , and @xmath10 is the light intensity .",
    "the mirror light is produced by a laser diode of power 40  mw detuned 1.5  ghz above the atomic d2 line ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) .",
    "the gaussian beam is elliptical and produces on the surface a spot with @xmath13 waist diameters of @xmath14 m along @xmath15 and @xmath16 m along @xmath4 ( see coordinate axes in fig.[prism ] ) .",
    "a measurement of the reflection threshold for the atom beam , taking into account the van der waals attraction toward the surface  ( landragin _ et al .",
    "_ in ref.@xcite ) , gives access to the light intensity at the surface in the spot center : @xmath17 .",
    "this value is lower than expected from the design of the dielectric coating ; we attribute this to the losses due to the roughness of the deposited tio@xmath6 layer ( see figure  [ afmpicture ] below and the discussion there ) .",
    "the experiment proceeds as follows : approximately @xmath18 atoms are confined in the hyperfine ground state @xmath19 in a ioffe pritchard ( ip ) type magnetic trap , 3.6  mm above the evanescent mirror @xcite .",
    "the magnetic trap is cigar shaped , @xmath15 being its long axis .",
    "oscillation frequencies are , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the radial directions ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the atoms are evaporatively cooled to below the condensation threshold and about @xmath22 atoms are released at @xmath23 by switching off the magnetic trapping fields .",
    "these atoms reach the mirror after free fall at @xmath24  ms and bounce on it with a velocity @xmath25 ( normal incidence @xmath26 , de broglie wavelength @xmath27 ) . around the bouncing time @xmath28 ,",
    "the mirror laser is switched on for @xmath29  ms .",
    "limiting this time window @xmath30 prevents near - resonant photon scattering during free fall or after reflection .",
    "the atoms are detected by absorption imaging either before or after reflection . during free fall",
    ", the cloud expands along the radial directions because potential and interaction energy is released , but its width along @xmath15 remains nearly constant . the analysis of pictures taken before reflection gives access to the following parameters : fraction of condensed atoms @xmath31 , kinetic temperature of thermal cloud @xmath32  nk , initial thomas - fermi size along @xmath15 of the condensed fraction @xmath33 m and thomas - fermi velocity width along @xmath5 : @xmath34 .",
    "the condensate velocity width along @xmath15 is very small , thus non directly measurable .",
    "however , it can be inferred from the knowledge of @xmath35 and the oscillation frequencies in the magnetic trap , using the solution for an expanding bec @xcite ; we get @xmath36",
    ". the observation of the center of mass motion during free fall permits us to calibrate the pixel size knowing gravity s acceleration and to infer the initial position and velocity of the cloud .",
    "the magnetic field switching process communicates a small acceleration to the atoms along @xmath15 , resulting in a horizontal velocity @xmath37 ( see figure  [ bounce ] ) .",
    "atoms for different times of flight after reflection : 2  ms , 7  ms , 12  ms , 17  ms and 22  ms .",
    "the pictures , taken with a 200  @xmath38s long , resonant pulse , are merely superimposed .",
    "the wide black line in the bottom is due to the prism surface , slightly tilted from the imaging axis .",
    "picture dimensions are 5.7  mm @xmath39 4.4  mm.,width=264 ]    after reflection , the absorption images change dramatically ( figure  [ bounce ] ) .",
    "the atoms occupy the surface of a scattering sphere , hence an elastic , but strongly diffuse scattering occurs . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the cloud width along @xmath15 increases from its initial value due to an additional velocity spread @xmath41 .",
    "the velocity gaussian radius at @xmath13 deduced from the pictures is @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account the initial velocity width before reflection , the spread due to diffuse reflection is @xmath43 , that is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the recoil velocity for rb .",
    "this corresponds to an angular ( rms ) spread @xmath46 .",
    "the effect of diffuse reflection along @xmath4 is more subtle to analyze , as this axis is aligned with the direction of observation .",
    "however , it is possible to extract information about @xmath47 from the picture .",
    "if for instance the scattering were totally isotropic , with @xmath48 , the atomic cloud should extend asymmetrically towards @xmath49 at a given position @xmath15 , as the projection of a spherical shell onto a plane extends towards the inner part of the circle ( see figure  [ profiles ] ) .",
    "if on the contrary the scattering would take place only along @xmath15 , the cloud width along @xmath5 at a given position @xmath15 should be very small , with a symmetric shape .",
    "to get some insight into what happens along @xmath4 , we performed a numerical simulation of the atomic reflection .",
    "the simulation calculates @xmath50 individual classical atomic trajectories .",
    "the initial positions and velocities are chosen to mimic the experimentally measured parameters : 40% of the atoms are `` condensed '' and are described by the initial 3d thomas - fermi velocity and position distribution .",
    "( we neglect the position spread along @xmath4 and @xmath5 because its contribution to the cloud size after a few ms of time of flight is very small . )",
    "the remaining 60% of the atoms are distributed according to gaussian profiles for velocity and position , with widths inferred from the knowledge of temperature and trap parameters .",
    "position and velocity of the cloud centre are fixed to the experimental values as well .",
    "atoms for the same times of flight than the experimental ones , figure  [ bounce ] . for this series ,",
    "the velocity spread was chosen to be @xmath51 .",
    "the position of the mirror surface is marked by a grey line.,width=264 ]    the mirror is modelled as an instantaneous diffuse reflector .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as the typical time spent in the evanescent wave is small , @xmath52s .",
    "after reflection , the atomic velocity is modified to describe both specular reflection ( inversion of vertical velocity ) and scattering .",
    "a random horizontal velocity is added to the reflected velocity with a gaussian distribution .",
    "we take a @xmath13 radius @xmath53 , as measured experimentally , and run simulations with varying @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath5 component of the velocity is adjusted in order to preserve kinetic energy ( the scattering process is elastic , total energy is conserved ) .",
    "the simulation also takes into account spontaneous emission . for our parameters ,",
    "the atom spontaneously emits on average 0.13 photons per bounce  @xcite .",
    "we randomly draw the number of photons from a poisson distribution and add a recoil of @xmath55 in a random direction in velocity space for each emission event .",
    "after calculation of all atomic trajectories , the atomic density profile is integrated along @xmath4 as in the experimental pictures .",
    "we finally apply a gaussian blur filter ( width @xmath56 m along @xmath15 and @xmath57 m along @xmath5 ) to mimic the finite resolution of the experimental imaging system that we calibrated independently .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the experimental and simulated pictures is very good as can be seen on figure  [ simul ] . to be more quantitative for the possible values of the velocity",
    "spread @xmath54 , we analyze the central part of the cloud . for each time of flight , a region of size 0.8",
    "mm @xmath39 1.5  mm along @xmath15 and @xmath5 respectively , centred on the maximum density of the cloud and identical for experimental and simulated pictures , is isolated and an integration of the signal is performed along @xmath15 .",
    "we are left with a cut of the cloud along @xmath5 , averaged over 0.8  mm along @xmath15 .",
    "the experimental profile is compared to the simulated one , for different choices of @xmath54 after the bounce .",
    "results are shown on figure  [ profiles ] for a time of flight 59  ms .     and averaged along @xmath15 , after 59  ms total time of flight , _",

    "thin line : totally anisotropic scattering ( @xmath65 ) ; dashed line : anisotropic scattering with @xmath66 ; bold line : isotropic scattering ( @xmath67 ) . all curves are normalized to a maximum value of unity.,width=321 ]    the experimental data clearly exclude an isotropic diffuse reflection ( figure  [ profiles ] , bold line ) .",
    "they also are different from the pure one dimensional scattering case ( thin line ) : what fits best of all is a model intermediate between these two extremes , _",
    "i.e. _ the scattering is only half as strong along @xmath4 compared to @xmath15 .",
    "the atom mirror thus has an angular reflection characteristic that is elongated in the direction parallel to the ( real part of the ) wave vector of the evanescent wave .",
    "spontaneous emission plays only a minor role for our parameters , but we found that the agreement with the experimental density profiles is improved by taking it into account , in particular on the lower left wing of the peak .      for a theoretical prediction of the anisotropic mirror reflection",
    ", we use the theory of ref.@xcite where the diffuse scattering is attributed to the interference between the evanescent wave and light diffusely scattered from the rough glass surface . within this theory",
    ", one can compute the width of the momentum distribution of the reflected atoms provided the power spectrum of the surface roughness is known .",
    "this power spectrum is a quantitative measure of the surface quality and has been measured with an atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "a typical @xmath68m@xmath69 portion of the surface of the coated prism is shown in figure  [ afmpicture ] .",
    "one sees the top face of pillar - like structures which are typical for epitaxially grown tio@xmath6 on a substrate .",
    "the afm data yield a surface roughness @xmath70  nm ( the rms spread of the measured surface profile ) .",

    "( we use capitalized boldface letters for two - dimensional vectors in the mirror plane . )",
    "it is found to be isotropic ( a function of @xmath72 only ) and well fitted in the wave vector range @xmath73 by a power law with a low - frequency cut - off ( see figure  [ psfit ] ) @xmath74    .",
    "the grains are the top facets of pillar - like structures characteristic of an epitaxed tio@xmath6 surface.,width=188 ]    the fit gives access to the parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in terms of this power spectrum ,",
    "the rms surface roughness @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 and the fitted parameters yield @xmath80  nm , in excellent agreement with the value directly deduced from the rms spread of the afm data .",
    "we now show that the diffuse reflection we observe can be understood within the theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "we note first that the cloud is so dilute at the bounce that a single - atom picture is sufficient to capture the physics @xcite .",
    "for a fixed incident momentum @xmath81 near normal incidence , the reflected wave function can be written in the form of a plane wave with a randomly modulated phase front : @xmath82 ,      \\label{eq : refl - psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is a normalization factor and @xmath84 .",
    "( the dependence on the angle of incidence is actually negligible for our parameters  @xcite . )",
    "the phase @xmath85 depends on the ` impact position ' @xmath86 on the mirror , _",
    "i.e. , _ the projection of * r * onto the mirror plane .",
    "we perform an ensemble average over the realizations of the rough surface and compute the atomic momentum distribution @xmath87 from the ( spatial ) fourier transform of the ` atomic coherence function ' ( sec .",
    "6 of ref.@xcite ) @xmath88 \\label{eq : atomic - coh - func } \\\\ & & \\times \\exp\\left [ - \\frac12 \\langle \\left ( \\delta\\phi ( { \\bf r } )   - \\delta\\phi ( { \\bf r } ' ) \\right)^2 \\rangle \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( we take @xmath89 , assuming the roughness to be statistically homogeneous . ) the variance of the phase shift can be found from the following formula ( eqs.(6.15 ) and ( 5.16 ) of ref.@xcite ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the `` atomic response function '' given in eq.(5.15 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "for the parameters of our experiment , we find that the phase shift has a variance @xmath92 large compared to unity . in this regime",
    ", ref.@xcite has shown that the reflected atomic velocity distribution approaches a gaussian shape whose width along the @xmath15-direction , for example , is given by @xmath93 this expression gives the additional broadening of the incident velocity distribution due to the diffuse mirror reflection .",
    "we perform the integration of eq.([eq : dqx - theory ] ) numerically , with the roughness power spectrum determined previously from the afm images ( eq.([eq : ps - model ] ) ) . for simplicity , we calculate the response function @xmath91 using scalar light scattering from the topmost interface only , ignoring the actual layered structure .",
    "we believe that this approximation is sufficient , at least for describing the scattering in the @xmath15-direction : as shown in ref  @xcite , the atom does not change its magnetic sublevel if it scatters in this direction and if the evanescent wave is linearly polarized .",
    "these conditions are met here so that both atom and light can be described by scalar wave fields .    within the theoretical model outlined above , the velocity spread along the propagation direction of the evanescent wave is found to be @xmath94 .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the experimental value @xmath95 .",
    "this is a very satisfying result because the theory only contains , within the approximations we made , parameters that are based on independent measurements .",
    "we believe that this is the first quantitative demonstration of evanescent wave scattering in the diffuse regime .",
    "we also compute the anisotropy of the reflected atoms and find a ratio @xmath96 , in good agreement with the value ( @xmath97 ) extracted from the experimental data .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , this anisotropy arises from the fact that diffuse reflection occurs predominantly by bragg transitions where a photon is absorbed from the evanescent wave ( with wave vector @xmath98 ) and another photon is emitted into a diffusely scattered mode that emerges at grazing incidence into the vacuum half - space ( or the inverse process ) .",
    "if these scattered modes are distributed isotropically in the mirror plane on a circle of radius @xmath99 , the ratio of the rms spreads would be @xmath100 .",
    "taking @xmath101 , which corresponds to scattered modes emerging at grazing incidence , we again find an anisotropy ratio of @xmath102 .",
    "this agreement is not very surprising since the rough surface has a power spectrum much broader than the photon wavenumber @xmath103 ( fig.[psfit ] ) . within this simple calculation ,",
    "however , we can also get a quick estimate of the impact of the dielectric coating .",
    "the choice @xmath104 corresponds to resonant scattering into waveguide modes in the tio@xmath105 layer and leads to a ratio @xmath106 which can not be excluded experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed the diffuse reflection of an ultracold atomic beam from an evanescent wave .",
    "the wave propagates on the rough surface of a dielectric prism , and light scattering leads to an atom mirror showing a significantly nonspecular reflection .",
    "the angular broadening of the reflected atoms , as well as their anisotropic angular distribution in the mirror plane , are in good agreement with a theory developed by henkel _",
    "it is remarkable that this agreement does not imply any free parameters since we independently measured the spectrum of the surface roughness with an afm . in our experiment , using a bec has mainly practical advantages . indeed , as we mentioned above , everything can be understood within a single - atom picture , and after diffuse scattering , spatial coherence is seriously reduced , as is discussed in ref.@xcite and investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the bec provides crucial advantages because we achieve a very clean situation .",
    "apart from a very low velocity spread @xmath107 , a bec has a negligible size when impacting the evanescent wave surface .",
    "this removes the need to take into account the mirror curvature due to the gaussian spot profile ; the contribution of the initial size to the cloud width after reflection is negligible ; and the losses given the finite size of the mirror ( the waist of the reflected laser beam ) are minimal .",
    "in fact , with a freely falling , ultracold , but thermal gas , the finite mirror size would lead to strongly reduced signal .",
