    "interstellar masers from a number of molecular species ( in particular main - line oh , water and methanol ) are known to be associated with high - mass star formation regions .",
    "class  ii methanol masers are unique amongst these in that they are only observed towards high - mass star formation regions @xcite , in contrast to oh and water masers which are also observed towards other astrophysical objects , such as late - type stars .",
    "the strongest methanol masers often show emission in multiple transitions and are projected against ultra - compact hii   regions ( e.g. w3(oh ) , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the majority of methanol masers only show emission in the 6.7 ( and sometimes 12.1  ghz ) transition and are not associated with detectable hii   regions @xcite .",
    "recent observations have shown that those sources which do not show centimeter radio continuum emission are associated with millimeter @xcite and sub - millimeter @xcite sources .",
    "they have a spectral energy distribution consistent with them being deeply embedded @xcite and being associated with a very early phase of the star formation process .",
    "masers are potentially powerful probes of the high - mass star formation process , but an understanding of the environment in which they arise is required before they can be used as such",
    ".    theoretical models of class  ii methanol masers invoke excitation to the second torsional state from the radiative field of warm dust at sub - millimeter and far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths to explain the high brightness temperatures observed @xcite .",
    "many methanol masers have been discovered in searches towards _ iras _ sources which meet the @xcite criteria for being ultra - compact hii   regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in many cases the masers are not directly associated with the _ iras _ sources , but rather with the larger star formation region .",
    "the _ iras _",
    "satellite had relatively poor angular resolution and suffered well documented problems in the galactic plane with saturation and confusion , due to the high density of strong sources .",
    "this does not mean that the masers are not associated with fir sources , but rather that they are not necessarily associated with the strongest source within a given star formation region .",
    "so _ iras _",
    "observations are of little use in determining the properties of the sources responsible for pumping the methanol masers .",
    "there have been a number of subsequent infrared surveys , such as the _ midcourse space experiment _ ( _ msx _ ) and the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "_ msx _ undertook a survey of the galactic plane at mid - infrared wavelengths , with an angular resolution of 18 .",
    "however , this is insufficient angular resolution to be able to resolve individual sources in high - mass star formation regions , which are typically at distances greater than 1  kpc .",
    "hence the _ msx _ sources closest to methanol masers usually have colors consistent with massive young stellar objects @xcite , but are typically not directly associated with the masers @xcite .",
    "it is well established that many stars are in binary or higher order multiple systems , and resolving the individual stars in such systems requires angular resolutions significantly better than 1 .",
    "however , the overall infrared characteristics of a multiple system will be dominated by the most massive star and it is the properties of this star that will have the primary influence on the masers . where reference is made to an infrared `` source '' throughout the paper this includes multiple star systems unresolved at arcsecond resolutions .",
    "2mass has sufficient angular resolution to be able to resolve the source associated with the maser from others within the cluster star forming environment .",
    "however , the longest observing wavelength for 2mass is only 2.2  and the majority of the maser sources are optically thick at near - infrared wavelengths . as for _ iras _ and _ msx _ , typically the closest 2mass sources are significantly offset from the maser location and are likely unrelated objects within the larger star formation region @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of near - infrared observations targeted at methanol maser sites @xcite , many of the masers have no nir counterpart , and in other cases the nir source is offset from the maser location .",
    "typically these nearby sources are extremely red , but , as for the 2mass associations , it is likely that in most cases they are sources unrelated to the masers within the larger star formation region .",
    "targeted mid - infrared observations have been made toward a number of methanol masers at wavelengths as long as 20   @xcite .",
    "these find mid - infrared sources associated with many of the masers that do not have near - infrared counterparts ( 67% in the case of @xcite ) , but also show that sometimes the sources associated with the methanol masers are optically thick to wavelengths longer than 20  , suggesting that they are deeply embedded and very young .",
    "the most significant problems with existing ground - based mid - infrared observations is limited sensitivity ( e.g. of the order of 15  mjy at 10   for * ? ? ?",
    "* and higher in the other cases ) and large astrometric uncertainty , due to the lack of guide stars at these wavelengths .",
    "this makes it impossible to accurately determine the relative location of the masers and mid - infrared sources , which is particularly important in situations where there are extended , or multiple mid - infrared emission regions .",
    "@xcite use a method of cross - correlating the centimeter radio continuum and mid - infrared emission to determine the best registration . however , there are significant differences between the emission at the two wavelengths , which means that the relative registration remains uncertain .",
    "the astrometry is highly dependent on the telescope and more recent ground - based mid - infrared observations targeted towards water maser sites have been able to achieve sub - arcsecond precision @xcite .",
    "further sensitive mid - infrared observations with good astrometric accuracy are highly desirable , as they will yield important information on the nature of the mid - infrared sources associated with methanol masers .",
    "_ glimpse _  ( galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinare ) is a legacy science program of the _ spitzer space telescope _ that surveyed the inner galactic plane ( @xmath1 = 1065 ) in a number of mid - infrared wavelength bands at 1.41.9resolution , using the _ irac _  ( infrared array camera ) instrument @xcite .",
    "the observations were made in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  bands of _ irac _ , and the quoted positional accuracy in the point source catalog is approximately 04 . as such it provides the best opportunity to date to investigate the mid - infrared properties of a large number of methanol masers , and compare them with other sources .",
    "i have used the 15 april 2005 release of the _ glimpse _ point source catalog and mosaicked images from the longest wavelength band ( 8.0  ) to investigate the mid - infrared properties of the fifty - six methanol masers in the galactic longitude range @xmath2 = 325335 .",
    "the positions of the methanol masers are known to an accuracy of 05 from australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations @xcite .",
    "the methanol masers under investigation include a statistically complete sample detected in the mt pleasant survey @xcite .",
    "in contrast , previous ground based mid - infrared observations have been primarily targeted either at _ iras_-associated , or strong maser peak flux density based samples @xcite .",
    "the fifty - six class  ii methanol masers in the region @xmath2",
    "= 325335  are listed in table  [ results ] , along with any _ glimpse _ point sources within 2  of the maser location .",

    "those which are not , are indicated in column 1 of table  [ results ] .",
    "three of the sources not within the statistically complete sample ( g@xmath3 , g@xmath4 , g@xmath5 ) were not detected in the mt pleasant survey , but rather in the survey of @xcite , the remainder were detected at mt pleasant , but lie outside the spatial or velocity range for which the search is complete @xcite .",
    "twenty - nine of the methanol masers in table  [ results ] have a _ glimpse _ point source within 2  ( 52% ) , considering only the statistically complete sources this becomes twenty - three of forty - one masers ( 56% ) .",
    "the magnitudes and flux densities observed in each of the 4 _ irac _ bands for each of the _ glimpse _ sources associated with methanol masers are listed in table  [ glimprop ] .    to cross - check the positional accuracy of the _ glimpse _ catalog and estimate the probablity of confusion , i measured the angular separation between each _ glimpse _ point source and the nearest 2mass point source for sources within a 30  radius of @xmath2 = 326.5 , @xmath6 = 0.0 .",
    "in total there are approximately 109,000 _ glimpse _ and 83,500 2mass point sources in this region .",
    "figure  [ fig : angsep ] shows the distribution of angular separations plotted as a histogram with 0.1  bins for the range 1 - 10 .",
    "the distribution peaks very strongly at 0.3 - 0.4 as predicted with a much smaller secondary peak at around 5which can be used to estimate the probability of chance coincidence as it relates to the source density in the two catalogs .",
    "approximately 34,000 _ glimpse _ sources have a 2mass point source within 1  and extrapolation of the tail of the coincidence distribution implies ( conservatively ) that more than 97% of these are valid associations .",
    "this implies that the probability of any of the associations between _ glimpse _ point sources and methanol masers listed in table  [ results ] being chance coincidences is low , particularly for the sources where the separation is less than 1 .",
    "the minimum requirement for a source to be included in the _ glimpse _ point source catalogue was that it had to be detected with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 5 , twice in one _ irac _ band and once in an adjacent band .",
    "the point source catalog is believed to be 99% reliable .",
    "the _ glimpse _",
    "archive is a more complete second catalog with less stringent conditions , requiring two detections with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 5 in any bands .",
    "the archive contains approximately 50% more sources than the point source catalog .",
    "a search of the _ glimpse _ archive finds sources within 2  of an additional 9 methanol masers that do not have an associated _ glimpse _ point source .",
    "the names of the sources from the _ glimpse _ archive ( where there is no associated _ glimpse _ point source ) are also listed in table  [ results ] . _",
    "glimpse_sources from the point source catalog have the prefix glmc and those from the archive glma , the archive sources are also listed in italics in tables  [ results ] & [ glimprop ] so that they stand out .",
    "considering both _ glimpse _",
    "point sources and archive sources , thirty - eight of the fifty - six methanol masers ( 68% ) have an associated _ glimpse _ source within 2 .",
    "for the forty - one methanol masers in the statistically complete sample there are thirty - two with associated _ glimpse _  sources ( 78% )    for each of the eighteen methanol masers that have no associated _ glimpse _ point or archive source there are two possible explanations , one is that the associated mid - infrared emission is too faint , the other is that the emission in the region is extended and hence not present in the point source catalog .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between these two possibilities by examining the _ glimpse _ mosaics in the region surrounding each maser source .",
    "figures  [ fig : images1]-[fig : images13 ] show the 8.0   _ glimpse _ observations ( grayscale ) and _ msx _ e - band ( 21  ) emission ( contours ) in a 2  square field centered on the location of each maser ( in some cases there are multiple maser sites within one field ) .",

    "comments on selected individual sources are given in section  [ sec : indiv ] .",
    "there are image artifacts present in some of the fields , wherever there are strong 8.0  sources they are accompanied by linear features running from a position angle of approximately 250  through to 70 ( the scanning direction of the observations ) .",
    "for some point sources ( e.g. g@xmath7 ) the point spread function of the _ irac _ instrument is evident , and a few fields ( e.g. g@xmath8 ) have blanked pixels due to saturation . however , these and other minor image artifacts do not have a significant impact on our ability to investigate the mid - infrared emission associated with the methanol masers .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : images1]-[fig : images13 ] that in the majority of cases where there is no _ glimpse _ point source near the masers , they are projected against regions of extended 8.0  emission .",
    "so at the sensitivity of the _ glimpse _ survey only a small percentage ( somewhere in the range of 5 - 10% ) of methanol masers are not associated with mid - infrared emission at wavelengths of 8.0   or shorter .",
    "information on associated water , oh and class  i methanol masers is available for the 6.7  ghz methanol masers from the mt pleasant sample in the region @xmath2=325 - 335  region , and these are listed in the last column of table  [ results ] , along with the relevant references .",
    "the 6.7  ghz methanol and the oh masers have both been observed with the atca and only sources where the two species are coincident to within 1  are listed .",
    "however , the water and class  i methanol maser observations were both made with single dish radio telescopes and were targeted towards the 6.7  ghz maser position , so a definite association between the two different maser species has not been made for these transitions .",

    "in addition , three - dimensional radiative transfer modeling @xcite has shown that for low - mass ( yso ) the seds in the infrared are complex and influenced by many factors including evolutionary status and orientation .",

    "however , it is still possible to make meaningful comparisons of the _ glimpse _ point sources with and without methanol masers , as having been made with the same instrument they all suffer the same effects and limitations .",
    "the modeling of @xcite shows that class  0 objects lie in a distinctive region of the _ glimpse _ [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] vs [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color - color diagram and it is the same area as that occupied by the methanol masers ( as can be seen by comparing fig .",

    "the fact that methanol masers are found in irdc complicates the issue to some degree . @xcite",

    "the distinctive properties of the _ glimpse _ sources associated with methanol masers also provide an opportunity to use them to target future maser searches .",
    "although there have been a number of untargetted searches covering moderately large areas @xcite , there is much of the region covered by _ glimpse _ which has yet to be searched . in developing targeting criteria for methanol masers",
    "it is a matter of compromising between detecting the highest possible percentage of the sources , while keeping a managable number of target locations to be searched .",

    "[ fig : colcol3412 ] & [ fig : colmag124 ] ) . figure  [ fig : colmag124 ] shows that the majority of methanol masers have [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath0 1.3 and an 8.0  magnitude less than 10 , while relatively few sources in the comparison field share these properties .",
    "a search of the _ glimpse _ point source catalog matches 5675 sources on these criteria ( @xmath490.02% of all _ glimpse _ sources ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate the detection rate and efficiency of a methanol maser search targeted towards _ glimpse _",
    "point sources with the criteria outlined above through comparison with one of the untargeted searches .",

    "the mt pleasant 26 m telescope has a fwhm of approximately 7  at 6.7  ghz and this reduces the total number of target positions within the selected region of the galactic plane to 352 .",

    "@xcite performed a similar analysis for various _ iras_-based search criteria and found typical efficiencies in the range 20 - 30% ( with a much smaller number of target sources ) , but in general detection rates were less than 50% with the best being 59% .",

    "point sources which meet certain criteria will detect many sources that similar _ iras_-based searches can not , however , at present 20% or so of sources can only be detected through untargeted searches .",
    "the clustering of high - mass star formation regions artificially enhances the detection rate of the targeting criteria .",
    "i have shown that approximately 50% of 6.7  ghz methanol masers have an associated _ glimpse _ point source , yet targeting criteria based on _ glimpse _ data is able to detect more than 80% of the masers .",

    "point sources that are not directly associated with the masers , but are nearby within the same star formation complex .    applying the same search strategy as outlined above ( consolidating targets within half the fwhm to a single pointing ) to the entire _ glimpse _  catalog reduces the number of target positions from 5675 to 3723 . extrapolating the findings for the @xmath2=325 335 region to the entire _ glimpse _ region suggests that 402 methanol maser sources would be found if all sources matching the above criteria were searched . if the detection rate observed in the @xmath2=325 335  region holds throughout the _ glimpse _  survey region then it predicts that there are approximately 487 methanol masers within this area with peak flux densities of 2 jy ( the sensitivity limit of the mt pleasant survey ) or more .",
    "the catalog of @xcite lists 391 6.7  ghz methanol masers in the _ glimpse _  region , of which 347 have a peak flux density of greater than 2 jy .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the 6.7  ghz methanol masers in this region have been detected by previous searches targeted towards oh masers and _ iras _ sources , but that a search based on the criteria listed above would likely yield of the order of 50 new detections .    a large number _ glimpse _",
    "sources that meet the criteria outlined above are very close to either the color limit or the magnitude limit and the detection efficiency calculated above could be raised relatively easily by making a small increase to the color limit , or a small decrease to the magnitude limit , however , this would naturally come at the cost of a reduced detection rate .",
    "the total number of _ glimpse _ sources that satisfy the criteria means that it must include many objects which are not high - mass young stellar objects ( since it would imply a rate of high - mass star formation approximately an order of magnitude in excess of that predicted from the imf ) .",
    "this contamination is most likely from lower - mass young stellar objects and perhaps some evolved low - mass stars .",
    "for example the models of @xcite show that the colors of the _ glimpse _ sources associated with methanol masers are very similar to those predicted for class  0 yso .",
    "it may be possible to use cross - correlation with other catalogues such as 2mass to reduce this level of contamination and develop more refined criteria for targeting high - mass young stellar objects .",
    "however , although this will increase the efficiency of any surveys , it is clear from the analysis above that the majority of stronger ( @xmath0 2  jy ) 6.7  ghz methanol masers from the _ glimpse _ region have already been detected .",
    "a striking feature of the 8.0  _ glimpse _ mosaics is the diffuse emission present throughout much of the galactic plane , this is due to the pah emission bands at 7.7 & 8.6  that fall within this _ irac _ band .",
    "superimposed upon this diffuse background are dark clouds ( irdc ) , and when examining the _ glimpse _ images on large scales it is clear that the methanol masers are preferentially associated with these .",
    "a brief subjective examination of _ glimpse _  8  images suggests that approximately 10 - 20% percent of irdc have associated methanol masers .",
    "a more robust , objective determination of this percentage is beyond the scope of this paper as the level of extinction , foreground emission , sizes and morphologies of the irdc cover a large range and development and application of consistent criteria to locate irdc in the _ glimpse _  observations is required . at the resolution and sensitivity of the _ glimpse _ observations ,",

    "the sub - millimeter reveals more details of the structure of the clouds , in particular the location of warmer clumps within the cold dust .",
    "the density , temperature and scale of the irdc have lead to speculation that they represent a very early stage in the star formation process , perhaps prior to the existence of young stellar objects .",
    "recent observations have detected `` warm '' ( 40 - 60k ) cores in a number of irdc @xcite and masers or young stellar objects associated with some of these cores @xcite .",
    "the warm cores and presence of masers suggests that some irdc harbor high - mass star formation in its very early stages .",
    "the presence of class  ii methanol masers towards faint emission sources in many irdc shows that in a sizeable fraction , high - mass star formation has commenced .",
    "it also suggests that those irdc which do not show maser emission from either water or methanol may be the best sites to study still earlier evolutionary phases of high - mass star formation .",
    "the comments on individual sources ( section  [ sec : indiv ] ) show that sometimes the methanol masers are associated with mid - infrared emission from the central regions of the dark cloud ( e.g. g@xmath57 ) , while in other cases they are offset from the strongest emission ( e.g. g@xmath58 , g@xmath59 ) . where they are associated with a region that has moderately bright , extended 8.0  emission surrounded by a dark cloud , the masers are typically located at the interface between the two .",
    "this suggests that the methanol masers may be marking regions where the interaction of an earlier epoch of star formation with the parent molecular cloud has triggered further high - mass star formation . that multiple epochs of high - mass star formation occur within an individual giant molecular cloud",
    "is well established for regions such as orion @xcite .",
    "the location of the methanol masers within the _ glimpse _ images suggests that in many cases star formation commences in the central regions of a molecular core and proceeds outwards .",

    "the three clumps of methanol masers are separated by a linear distance of about 6  pc from their nearest neighbouring maser . assuming the 6.7  ghz methanol masers have a lifetime of @xmath62 years it is improbable that any localised event triggered the fragmentation and subsequent star formation occurring along the filament as it would require any disturbance to propagate at speeds in excess of 60  kms@xmath63 .",
    "an important question relating to the common maser species ( oh , methanol and water ) is whether or not we can use them to help identify an evolutionary sequence in high - mass star formation ? previous attempts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been hampered by the limitations of earlier generations of infrared catalogs .",
    "many star forming regions show emission in two or more of these maser species , so clearly there is a large degree of overlap in the evolutionary phases , however , there are also many sources where only one of the common maser species is observed .",
    "@xcite surveyed a large number of star forming regions with the vla , observing main - line oh masers , water masers and radio continuum emission .",
    "they concluded that the water masers are associated with younger regions , with those which show both species being of intermediate age , and those with only oh masers the oldest .",
    "early searches for class ii methanol masers towards oh maser sites were very successful .",
    "however , untargetted searches , and those targetted towards _ iras _ sources detected many in regions with no oh masers and as outlined in the introduction there is good evidence from millimeter and submillimeter observations that some methanol masers trace an early stage of the high - mass star formation process @xcite .",
    "this is interpretted similarly to the water / oh relationship with the methanol masers arising prior to the oh phase , but with a significant degree of overlap .",

    "the water and class  i methanol maser observations were both made with single dish radio telescopes and were targeted towards the 6.7  ghz maser position , so a definite association between the two different maser species has not yet been made for these transitions .",
    "future high resolution observations are likely to show that in some cases the two maser species are associated with independent objects within a larger star - forming complex",
    ". these `` false '' associations will add confusion to attempts to find any evolutionary trend , however , they are unlikely to mask it completely .    to investigate whether there is any evidence for the various maser species tracing different evolutionary phases the 29 _ glimpse _ point sources associated with 6.7  ghz methanol masers were split into two sub - samples on the basis of whether or not they also had an associated oh maser . a number of color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , including those shown in fig .",

    "class  i methanol masers are created at the interface between molecular outflows and the parent cloud @xcite .",
    "such outflows are expected to be most energetic and prevalent during the infall / accretion phase of star formation and hence it has been speculated that sources with associated class  i methanol masers may signpost an earlier phase of high - mass star formation than those without . in general the youngest stellar objects",

    "[ fig : classi ] appears consistent with this picture , with the youngest maser sources with associated class  i methanol masers generally having the redest _ glimpse _  colors .    as outlined above , methanol masers with associated oh masers",
    "are thought to be typically associated with a more advanced evolutionary phase than those without .",
    "figure  [ fig : oh ] shows that methanol masers with associated oh masers are generally brighter at 8.0   than those without .",
    "all of these sources lie in the same region of the galactic plane and so the range of distances for the two sub - samples should be very similar , implying that the sources with associated oh masers really are more luminous at 8.0  and not simply closer .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this :    * the stellar luminosity range traced by oh masers may cutoff at a higher mass than is the case for methanol masers .",
    "* the sources with associated oh masers have less silicate absorption and/or more pah emission in the 8.0  band than those without .    both of the above possibilities are consistent with other observed properties of oh and methanol maser sources .",
    "a greater percentage of oh masers are associated with ultra - compact hii regions than are methanol masers @xcite . the more massive the star , the brighter the hii  region and the easier it will be to detect at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "further , if the methanol masers extend to a lower mass range then we would expect there to be more methanol maser sources than oh maser sources , as is observed @xcite .",
    "however , the 6.7  ghz methanol masers typically have a peak flux density an order of magnitude greater than main - line oh masers from the same source @xcite and so this may partly be due to the sensitivity of searches for the two maser species . alternatively , if oh and methanol masers trace similar stellar mass ranges then the observation that oh masers are more often associated with hii regions implies that they are generally at a later evolutionary phase . as an hii region forms and",
    "evolves it will gradually destroy or clear the surrounding dust reducing silicate absorption and the uv radiation will stimulate pah emission . both of these effects will increase the 8.0  emission .",
    "these two hypotheses can be tested through mid - infrared spectroscopy of the _ glimpse _ sources .",

    "glimpse _ 8.0   images show that the majority of class  ii methanol masers are associated with sources embedded within irdc , and that a significant fraction of irdc contain methanol masers .",
