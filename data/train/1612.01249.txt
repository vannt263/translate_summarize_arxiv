    "the distributed resistive mixing theory meanwhile regards the channel of a transistor as a non - quasi - static rc - ladder , such that each segment of the channel operates as a self - mixing power detector .    assuming the electron mobility @xmath1 for typical silicon cmos , the moment relaxation time @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is effective transport mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 the electron charge @xcite .",

    "from the non - linear behavior of the mos transistor , the small - signal drain - to - source current @xmath24 is a function of the gate - to - source @xmath25 and drain - to - source @xmath26 voltages and can be expressed by the two - dimensional taylor series as    @xmath27    where the taylor series coefficients are obtained from the derivatives of dc drain - to - source current @xmath28 as @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    if @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 represents the amplitude ratio of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 the phase difference between them ) , it can be shown that the even order non - linearity generates a dc component .",
    "all other frequency components ( at integer multiple of @xmath38 ) , being located well beyond the @xmath39 of the transistor , are heavily attenuated . here",
    ", we will restrict the analysis to the second order terms as they are the dominant one and give square law power detection .",
    "then , the dc current response to terahertz signal can be given by @xmath40    we can also assume @xmath41 and @xmath42 without losing the generality .",
    "the coefficients described in equations ( [ eq_gm2]),([eq_gds2 ] ) and ( [ eq_g11 ] ) can be obtained from the transistor model . in this work",
    ", bsim4 is used to extract the taylor series coefficients which were also verified from the measured iv curves .",
    "[ fig_gm2 ] , [ fig_gds2 ] and [ fig_g11 ] presents the behavior of second order non - linear terms : transconductance ` @xmath43 ' , output conductance ` @xmath44 ' and intermodulation ` @xmath45 ' respectively , as a function of dc bias conditions for @xmath46 nmos .    from fig .",
    "[ fig_gm2 ] , [ fig_gds2 ] and [ fig_g11 ] , it can be seen that there are two distinct regions of operation with respect to drain - source bias .",
    "one is unbiased drain - source or cold region where @xmath47 and the other is drain - biased region , especially where @xmath48 . from now on when we refer to drain - biased operation , it means the region where @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that in drain - biased case , @xmath43 is dominant whereas @xmath44 and @xmath45 are prominent in unbiased - drain operation @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig_gds2 ] and [ fig_g11 ] show that @xmath44 and @xmath45 have comparable magnitudes at @xmath50 but @xmath44 is negative while @xmath45 is positive .",
    "thus , they generate current in opposite directions which are then subtracted .",
    "the peaks of @xmath44 and @xmath45 occurs at slightly different values of @xmath17 , therefore , the generated current can be maximized in between these peaks .",
    "when drain - bias @xmath51 is applied , @xmath43 dominates the generated current . it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_gm2 ] that for @xmath52 , @xmath43 continues to increase with the increase in @xmath53 whereas for @xmath54 , it shows a peak at certain @xmath53 and then start to decrease .",
    "hence , the generated current follows the same trend .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitude of @xmath43 is significantly smaller than that of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , but because of opposite polarity of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( assuming @xmath55 ) , those currents tend to cancel each other in cold operation whereas the currents of @xmath43 and @xmath45 tends to add in drain - biased region .",

    "[ fig_rv_3d ] and [ fig_ri_3d ] for the same @xmath70 nmos fet ( assuming @xmath55 ) .",
    "one noticeable difference between the voltage and current responsivities is that the voltage responsivity is an order of magnitude higher in drain - biased region than in cold operation whereas the current responsivity shows little variation .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained by the voltage division between channel resistance and load impedance .    in case of current responsivity , since the load resistance is quite small compare to the channel resistance , the behavior of @xmath71 is essentially determine by the current generated by the second order non - linearities only .",
    "the current responsivity is a little lower in unbiased - drain region than in drain - biased region because of the opposite polarity between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as already explained earlier . in fig .",
    "[ fig_ri_3d ] , the peak current responsivity occurs at @xmath54 because the peaks of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 occur above @xmath16 .",
    "the peak current responsivity also follows the same behavior as that of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath53 in drain - biased region .    for voltage responsivity in cold operation ,",
    "the channel resistance is low and hence little voltage appears across load ( fig .",
    "[ fig_eq_sch ] ) . as drain voltage increases from zero , both the channel resistance and the generated current increases .",
    "hence , the output voltage increases .",
    "it is important to note that the peak voltage responsivity occurs at @xmath72 and moves towards lower @xmath17 with increase in @xmath53 .",
    "this behavior is again because of the voltage division between the channel resistance and load .    from the above analysis",
    ", one can easily find the optimum bias point for the maximum responsivity .",
    "nmos with @xmath73     nmos with @xmath74      the noise - equivalent power ( nep ) is defined as the power at which the signal - to - noise ratio becomes unity for detector time constant of @xmath75 . in this work ,",
    "only the channel thermal noise is considered ( even in the case where the mosfet operates in saturation mode ) for simplicity .",
    "the noise spectral power density of channel thermal noise is given by @xmath76 , where the coefficient @xmath77 and @xmath78 is channel conductance at @xmath79 .",
    "the nep of the detector only , in both the current and voltage read out mode , is essentially the same given by the ratio of channel current noise to the generated current response and can be expressed as @xmath80}{r_i}\\ ] ]    @xmath81    the simulated nep for @xmath82 nmos is shown in the fig . [ nep ] .",
    "the minimum nep of @xmath83 is obtained at @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) which is close to the peak point of voltage responsivity .",
    "the minimum nep in cold operation is higher by more than two times , i.e. @xmath87 , at @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this point is closer to the peak current responsivity .",
    "thus , it can be said that if detector is in cold operation , then the current readout mode should be preferred as it can achieve low nep and high current responsivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ri_3d ] ) simultaneously for the same gate bias .",
    "similarly , the voltage readout mode can provide minimum nep and peak voltage responsivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rv_3d ] ) simultaneously for the same gate bias , when detector is drain - biased .",
    "it is important to note that with dc drain current , @xmath90 noise is also added which can severely degrade nep .",
    "therefore , the drain - biased detector should be used only when thz signal can be modulated above the @xmath90 noise corner frequency and the detector output can be high pass filtered .",
    "in this section , we will compare the response of four possible configurations of the thz detector with respect to the thz signal application , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_topo_sch ] , where the gate - source and drain - source ac voltage are given along with respective circuit schematic . here",
    "we will assume @xmath91 for all cases , and @xmath92 or @xmath93 represents the in - phase and differential application of @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively .    in detector topology ( a )",
    ", the thz signal is applied at the gate side only , so the response will depend on @xmath43 which is very low in unbiased - drain region but high in drain - biased mode ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gm2 ] ) .",
    "topology ( b ) is the most commonly used architecture . in this case ,",
    "thz signal is coupled to both gate and drain through a large capacitor @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , all second order terms become important ( equation ( [ i_thz ] ) ) . the generated current and the effects of load",
    "are already explained in section ii .",
    "the voltage and current responsivities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rv_3d ] and [ fig_ri_3d ] , respectively .    in topology ( c ) ,",
    "thz signal is applied to the drain node only and so transconductance non - linearity @xmath44 matters . in cold operation",
    ", this topology generates higher current than topologies ( a ) and ( b ) , because there is no opposite current generated from @xmath45 . in drain - biased case",
    ", this topology will show the lowest responsivity of all four configurations because @xmath95 .    ,",
    "@xmath96 ,  ( b )  @xmath97 ,  ( c )  @xmath98 ,  @xmath99 ,  ( d )  @xmath100    with topology ( d ) in cold operation , the differential signals at the gate and drain node is beneficial as @xmath44 and @xmath45 will add up instead of being cancelled .",
    "thus , the differential derive of gate and drain nodes would lead the highest responsivity among all four topologies .",
    "this will also improve the nep beyond what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nep ] , since channel thermal noise remains the same .",
    "but in drain - biased case , the responsivity would be low because the currents generated by @xmath43 and @xmath45 have opposite polarity .",
    "the actual implementation of a differential topology poses several challenges ( detector design is discussed in next section ) .",
    "if two mosfets are used with a differential antenna as detector front end , then two separate input matching networks are required for gate and drain sides .",
    "these matching networks can add different losses and delays to the thz signal , thus complicating the design .",
    "the order of responsivities for unbiased - drain case is @xmath101 and for drain - biased case is @xmath102 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rv_topo_0vds ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_rv_topo_1vds ] , respectively .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that in unbiased - drain and drain - biased regions , differential and in - phase signals should be used , respectively , for maximum responsivity .",
    "nmos at @xmath47 and @xmath103 ]     nmos at @xmath104 and @xmath103 ]      all the terms @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are directly proportional to the aspect ratio @xmath105 , so the wider transistors with minimum allowed length should maximize @xmath106 .",
    "the adoption of minimum channel length is also in accordance with the resonant regime @xmath107 of plasmon interference where the channel length approaches the critical decay length of plasma waves @xcite thus increasing responsivity .",
    "however , in non - resonant regime , mosfet dimension should be chosen considering the loading effects and channel thermal noise . to understand this ,",
    "let s consider the equivalent circuit current and voltage readout modes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_eq_sch ] . detector with in - phase gate and drain signals is considered in the following analysis .",
    "the peak values of calculated voltage responsivity at @xmath84 for different dimensions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rv_max ] .",
    "it is important to mention that this result is for @xmath103 ( which is close to the ideal case of infinite load ) .",
    "output voltage is dependent on both the generated current and the channel resistance .",
    "higher @xmath108 increases @xmath106 but decreases channel resistance at a higher rate .",
    "thus , longer channels with narrower widths show better voltage responsivity .",
    "this has been verified up to @xmath109 through on - wafer measurements @xcite .",
    "the variation of current responsivity with device dimensions is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ri_max ] @xmath110 , close to the ideal case of zero ohm load ) . in current readout mode ,",
    "the improvement in responsivity with the aspect ratio is because of the enhancement in @xmath106 , , as long as @xmath111 .",
    "thus , shorter channels with wider widths show better current responsivity .",
    "the voltage and current readout modes show opposite tendency with @xmath108 because of the variation of @xmath112 from zero to infinity .",
    "if an intermediate value is chosen for @xmath112 , then the behavior of voltage and current responsivities tends to become similar .",
    "note that we havent taken into account the effects of parasitic capacitances which may degrade the performance of detector ( especially for high aspect ratios ) by shunting the thz signal .",
    "however , by adopting the matching circuits , the effects of parasitic capacitances can be nullified , leading to similar responsivity behaviors predicted by this work .    as described in section ii , nep is independent of loading effects ( provided that the load adds negligible noise ) and",
    "hence is a better figure of merit for choosing the device dimension .",
    "the minimum calculated nep at @xmath84 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_nep_min ] .",
    "shorter channel lengths and narrower width detectors show better noise performance @xcite .",
    "nep also shows a peak with channel length variation for a fixed width . increasing channel length from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , increases nep because of the more rapid reduction in the generated current compare to the channel thermal noise . from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , the generated current decrease at a slower rate whereas the channel current noise reduces more sharply , hence , nep improves .",
    "reducing the width of the transistors , decreases the current noise at much faster rate than the reduction in generated current and thus narrower width leads to lower nep .",
    "for verifying the analysis , mosfet detectors are implemented in @xmath19 cmos .",
    "[ fig_det_sch ] shows the circuit schematic and cross - sectional view of the detector along with the load impedance . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_det_sch ] , the detector adopts a differential patch antenna implemented in the top aluminum layer and uses m6-m7 as the ground .",
