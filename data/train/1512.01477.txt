    "over the last couple of decades , quantum entanglement @xcite was shown to be an useful resource due to its vast applicability in quantum computational @xcite , and communicational tasks @xcite as well as in other information processing protocols @xcite . in a large number of cases , entangled states turn out to be more advantageous in performing the job than the states without entanglement . on the other hand ,",
