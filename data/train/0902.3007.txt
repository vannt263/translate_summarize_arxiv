    "recent timing studies of central compact objects ( ccos ) in supernova remnants ( snrs ) have found young neutron stars ( nss ) whose spin - down is imperceptible due to a weak dipole magnetic field @xcite . more generally , ccos are defined by their steady , predominantly thermal x - ray emission , lack of optical or radio counterparts , and absence of pulsar wind nebulae ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "of the six firm members of the cco class , two are identified explicitly as pulsars , while searches for pulsations from the other ccos have been unsuccessful . in particular ,",
    "claims have been made for several candidate spin periods of , the cco in  @xcite , but none has been confirmed .    has long been considered the stellar remnant of the supernova explosion that produced , given its central location , lack of an optical counterpart , and hot thermal spectral properties @xcite .",
    "itself is an oxygen - rich snr , similar to cas  a. its age is estimated as @xmath9  kyr from the proper motion of its oxygen knots ( winkler et al .",
    "1998 ) , and its distance @xmath10  kpc is derived from absorption features @xcite .",
    "more recently , an unusually large transverse velocity of @xmath11  km  s@xmath6 was measured for  @xcite , testing proposed mechanisms of natal kick .    in this letter",
    "we present a reanalysis of a pair of timing observation of  acquired with the _ newton x - ray multi - mirror mission _ ( _ xmm - newton _ ) observatory .",
    "we find a highly significant pulsed signal in both data sets that imposes an interesting upper limit on the period derivative .",
    "becomes the third cco pulsar , with timing and spectral properties similar to those of the two other cco pulsars ,  in kes  79 @xcite and  in  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the physical basis for the class of cco pulsars and how their natal properties differ from radio pulsars and magnetars .",
    "two archival _ xmm - newton _  observations of are best suited to search for coherent pulsations .",
    "these were obtained on 2001 april 15 and november 8 using the european photon imaging camera ( epic ; @xcite ) operating in `` small - window '' mode ( @xmath12 field - of - view ) .",
    "this mode provides 5.7  ms time resolution , allowing a search for even the most rapidly rotating young pulsar .",
    "the epic  pn detector is sensitive to x - rays in the nominal @xmath13  kev range with energy resolution @xmath14 .",
    "the medium filter was used with the target placed at the default epic  pn focal plane location for a point source .",
    "the concurrent epic  mos data are not used in this work because of its more limited ( 2.7  s ) time resolution .",

    "both observations were uncontaminated by flare events , providing @xmath15  ks of good epic  pn exposure time during each epoch . after taking into account the ccd readout dead - time ( 29% ) , this translates to 16  ks of live - time per observation in `` small window '' mode .",
    "photon arrival times were converted to the solar system barycenter using source coordinates @xmath16 ( j2000.0 ) derived from a contemporaneous _ chandra _  observation . in the following analysis",
    "we choose a source aperture @xmath17 in radius centered on  to maximize signal over background , except where otherwise noted .",
    "this region encloses @xmath18 of the source flux .",
    "count rates and exposure times are presented in table  [ timetable ] .      to search for a pulsed signal ,",
    "arrival times of photons were initially extracted in the energy band @xmath19  kev under the hypothesis that hard x - rays coming from a smaller area might be more strongly pulsed than soft x - rays from the full stellar surface . a @xmath20-bin",
    "fast fourier transform was used .",
    "the most significant signal detected was @xmath21  ms in both epic  pn data sets , with no higher harmonics .",
    "we constructed a periodogram centered on this signal using the @xmath22 ( rayleigh ) test @xcite and localized the pulsed emission with a peak statistic of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the 2001 april and november observations , respectively .",
    "these statistics correspond to 99.991% and 99.995% confidence , respectively , after allowing for the number of independent trials ( @xmath25 ) in a blind search for @xmath26  ms , the nyquist limit .",
    "the timing results are summarized in table  [ timetable ] .",
    "the periods derived from the @xmath22 test are statistically identical .",
    "the periodogram derived from each data set is shown in figure  [ timeplot ] along with the pulse profile folded at the best period . with a single",
    "coherent fold using both data sets , a total power of @xmath27 is recovered without the need for a period derivative .",
    "this corresponds to a negligible probability of chance occurrence .",
    "the formal result is @xmath28  s  s@xmath6 .",
    "the uncertainty is @xmath29 and is computed by propagating the uncertainties on the individual period measurements . from the @xmath3 upper - limit of @xmath30",
    "s  s@xmath6 we constrain the spin - down power of  to @xmath31  erg  s@xmath6 , the surface dipole magnetic field strength to @xmath32  g , and the characteristic age to @xmath33  kyr .",
    "the background - subtracted pulsed fraction is @xmath34 for both observations .",
    "the pulsed fraction is defined here as @xmath35 , where we choose the minimum of the folded light curves as the unpulsed level .",
    "the pulse shape is evidently unchanged between observations , suggesting a stable underlying emission process .",
    "no other significant signal is detected in either data set .",
    "in particular , we examined the two weaker candidate signals reported by @xcite from these observations .",
    "although we see these peaks , neither is statistically significant or repeatable between the two observations .",
    "we also analyzed all archival x - ray data sets that might yield detections of  and further constrain its timing parameters , but none proved sensitive enough .",
    "a search for the signal in the softer energy band reveals that the pulse is indeed present , below 1.0  kev , but shifted in phase by half a cycle relative to the hard pulse .",
    "figure  [ phaseplot ] shows that the phase shift is remarkably abrupt , with a half cycle step ( @xmath36 ) at an energy of @xmath37  kev .",
    "the location of the shift is unresolved to better than @xmath38  kev , limited by the counting statistics and the epic  pn energy resolution of @xmath39  kev at 1  kev .",
    "this shift effectively cancels the signal in a full - spectrum search .",
    "@xcite performed a comprehensive spectral analysis of the _ xmm - newton _  data on , showing that a two - component fit is necessary .",
    "they preferred a double blackbody model , which is also compatible with our expectation that surface thermal emission dominates over any other source of x - rays from ccos",
    ". we can investigate the cause of the phase shift in the pulse profiles by examining pulse phase - resolved spectra and searching for features that may be phase - dependent .",
    "in particular , we extracted two spectra , one in the phase band centered on the pulse peak found in the harder energy band ( @xmath40 ) , as shown in figure  [ timeplot ] , and the other centered on the phase band found for the softer emission ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "each spectrum covers a phase interval 0.4  cycles and is referred to herein as the hard and soft phase spectra .",
    "we combined data from both observations and grouped the two phase resolved spectra with a minimum of 100 counts per channel .",
    "these were fitted to the double blackbody model in the @xmath42  kev energy range .",
    "we find that both spectra can be fitted with the same component temperatures , with phase - dependent normalization .",
    "the fitted spectra are shown in figure  [ specplot ] and the best fit parameters are listed in table  [ spectab ] . for the soft phase",
    "there is clear evidence of positive residuals from the continuum model in the @xmath43  kev range .",
    "this is well modeled by the addition of a gaussian emission line of @xmath44  kev with an equivalent width of @xmath45  ev . comparing a fit without and with the line feature results in a change from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , for 70 and 67 degrees - of - freedom , respectively .",
    "for the hard - phase spectrum , the continuum model provides a satisfactory fit without the need for an added line component ( @xmath48  ev ) .",

    "as the star rotates , the hard emission dominates over the soft component when the hotter side is facing the viewer , while half a cycle later , the soft emission dominates as the harder emission is now ( partially ) eclipsed by the star . based on their phase relationship , evidently @xmath1 , the two spots are on opposite sides of the ns .",
    "several measurements favor this explanation : 1 ) both the soft and hard phase spectra can be fitted to a double blackbody model with the same component temperatures , but phase dependent normalizations , 2 ) the phase shift energy ( @xmath78  kev ) is in agreement with the cross - over energy between blackbody components for the above best fit model ( @xmath79  kev ; cf .",
    "figure  [ phaseplot ] and figure  [ specplot ] ) , 3 ) for this model fit , the magnitude of the pulse modulation is consistent with the change of the derived areas for both the soft and hard phase spectra ( see table  [ spectab ] ) .    in this picture ,",
    "the geometry is strongly constrained .",
    "the small modulation requires that the spin axis be nearly aligned with the line - of - sight .",
    "furthermore , the hot spot axis must be nearly perpendicular to the spin axis since both temperature components are evident throughout the rotation phase .",
    "future modeling of the observed spectrum and light curves will allow us to test this hypothesis , of opposed thermal hot - spots for , and quantify the hot - spot and viewing geometries ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". this study should also provide important constraints on the previously allowed spectral models @xcite of the pulsar .",
    "in the dipole spin - down formalism , the @xmath3 lower limit of @xmath8  kyr on the characteristic age of , in combination with its true ( snr ) age of @xmath80  kyr , implies that its initial spin period @xmath81 is identical to its current period @xmath21  ms to @xmath82 accuracy .",
    "thus ,  becomes the third cco whose initial spin period is known to be large , and whose surface dipole magnetic field strength , @xmath83  g , is smaller than those of the canonical young radio pulsars . in comparison ,",
    "the upper limits on @xmath84 from timing of  @xcite and  @xcite are @xmath85  g and @xmath86  g , respectively .",
    "is virtually a twin of the 105  ms pulsar  in kes  79 which , however , is @xmath87 pulsed .",
    "in contrast , the weak ( @xmath88 ) pulse of  is more similar to the light curve of the 424  ms pulsar .",
    "the latter is most notable for the prominent cyclotron absorption lines in its soft x - ray spectrum . for",
    ", the likely detection of a weak emission line is reminiscent of the energy dependence of the pulse phase in  @xcite , which suggests that electron cyclotron resonance processes may be affecting its pulse shape .",
    "the surface @xmath89-field strength of  is estimated to be @xmath90  g from its absorption features @xcite , in particular , the cyclotron fundamental at 0.7  kev , and the magnetic field of  may be similar .    the physics of the cco class , evidently characterized by weak magnetic field and slow , original spin , may lie in the turbulent dynamo that generates the magnetic field .",
    "the strength of the dynamo depends on the rotation rate of the proto - neutron star @xcite , so the magnetic field strength is inversely correlated with the initial period .",
    "_ chandra _  proper motion measurements of  reveal an extraordinarily large transverse velocity ( @xmath91 km  s@xmath6 , @xcite ; @xmath92 km  s@xmath6 , @xcite ) . as discussed by @xcite , this high velocity restricts the possible models for ns kicks , of which there are three broad categories ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of the spin parameters of  now allows us to eliminate two of these models : 1 ) the magnetic - induced asymmetric neutrino emission model requires a magnetic field of @xmath93  g @xcite and can only produce velocities @xmath94 km  s@xmath6 , and 2 ) the electromagnetic rocket effect @xcite needs an initial spin period @xmath95  ms to achieve the velocity of .",
    "therefore , the third model , that of hydrodynamic instability during the explosion @xcite , emerges as the most likely explanation for large ns kicks .",
    "this is consistent with a highly asymmetric explosion , as indicated for , wherein the momentum of the oxygen knots match the momentum of , but in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the hydrodynamic mechanism is the one mechanism of the three candidate theories that does _ not _ lead naturally to alignment between the spin axis and the direction of proper motion that is observed in the slowly moving crab ( @xmath96 km  s@xmath6 ) and vela ( @xmath97 km  s@xmath6 ) pulsars , and is statistically evident in larger samples of pulsars @xcite .",
    "if the spin of  were aligned with its velocity , which is nearly in the plane of the sky , then we would have expected to see a large rotational modulation from any surface hot spot . on the contrary , if the slow initial spin period of  is longer than the duration of the kick mechanism , the impulse of the asymmetric kick could have been expended in one direction rather than being averaged out by rotation .",
    "thus , the long spin period of  allows its spin axis and velocity vector to be misaligned .",
    "this is consistent with our model for the weak modulation , where the spin axis is close to the line - of - sight , nearly perpendicular to the velocity vector , as is allowed for a large kick from the hydrodynamic mechanism .",
    "the discovery of  advances the argument , reviewed by @xcite , that slow original spin and weak magnetic field constitute the physical basis of the cco class .",
    "there may even be a causal connection between slow natal spin and weak magnetic field through a turbulent dynamo that creates the magnetic field .",
    "the next step is a dedicated timing study of  to determine whether it is spinning down steadily , and to measure its period derivative and dipole magnetic field .",
    "an alternative possibility that it is accreting from a fallback disk @xcite can also be tested by detailed timing .",
    "similar studies are underway for the other cco pulsars .",
    "we predict that most if not all of the remaining ccos will turn out to be weakly magnetized pulsars with @xmath98  s. these may include the cco in cassiopeia  a , and possibly an as - yet unseen ns in sn 1987a . in the absence of spin parameters , is difficult to discriminate between a low magnetic field cco and a quiescent magnetar on the basis of an x - ray spectrum alone , as these classes have similar spectral properties .",
    "before the cco pulsars were known , both cas  a and sn 1987a were hypothesized to host magnetars . however , the recent retraction @xcite of claimed evidence from the _ spitzer space telescope _ for an historic sgr - like outburst in cas  a @xcite leaves a weakly magnetized ns as the most compelling model for that youngest of known ccos . in the case of cas",
    "a , we must allow for the possibility that an energy - dependent phase shift similar to  makes it difficult to detect pulsations .",
    "we are searching for similar effects in all ccos .",
    "this investigation is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "this work is was made possible by nasa xmm grant nnx08ax67x , which provided critical hardware support ."
