    "with the availability of the first electronic computing machines , fermi , pasta , and ulam @xcite investigated the dynamics of a chain of nonlinear oscillators , in particular , their relaxation to thermal equilibrium .",
    "their work had a , in retrospect surprisingly , strong impact .",
    "we refer to the special issue @xcite which accounts for the first fifty years . in our contribution",
    ", we will study the @xmath0-chain .",
    "this is a linear chain of equal mass particles which are coupled to their nearest neighbors by nonlinear springs with a potential of the form @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , and @xmath6 being the string elongation .",
    "( according to the fpu convention , the @xmath7-chain has a nonlinearity @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 . )",

    "numerically , one common setup is to consider a chain of length @xmath3 , and to couple its left- and rightmost particles to thermal reservoirs at temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively . for long times the chain relaxes to a steady state with a non - zero average energy current @xmath16 , and",
    "the interest lies in the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath3 for large @xmath3 . for a regular transport ,",
    "i.e. , for transport satisfying fourier s law , one has @xmath18 for large @xmath3 .",
    "anomalous transport corresponds to @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . in the @xmath0-chain",
    "more recent molecular dynamics simulations point to an @xmath7 of approximately @xmath21 @xcite , and thus a larger energy transport than expected on the basis of fourier s law . in these simulations",
    "chain lengths of up to @xmath22 are used , and the result seems to be stable for a range of fairly low boundary temperatures . in @xcite",
    "it is claimed that for somewhat higher boundary temperatures , there is a crossover at large @xmath3 to @xmath23 .",
    "hence , even on the numerical level the accurate value of @xmath7 is still being debated .    in this paper , we will adopt a different , but physically equivalent procedure .",
    "one prepares initially ( for @xmath24 ) the infinite @xmath0-chain in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the initial conditions of the hamiltonian dynamics are distributed according to the ( at this stage formal ) gibbs measure @xmath26.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this measure does not change in time .",
    "one now adds some extra energy close to the origin and studies the spreading of this excess energy . to be more precise ,",
    "let us introduce the local energy , @xmath27 , at the site @xmath28 by @xmath29.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also employ the shorthand notation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the solution to the hamiltonian dynamics ( [ eq : hamdyn ] ) for given initial conditions .",
    "then we define the normalized local average excess energy by @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes the thermal average ( [ eq : defgibbs ] ) over the initial conditions , and @xmath34 is a normalization guaranteeing @xmath35 .",
    "one has @xmath36 , and the energy spread at time @xmath37 is defined as the spatial variance @xmath38    fourier s law corresponds to a diffusive spreading , @xmath39 for large @xmath37 , while an exponent @xmath40 corresponds to superdiffusive spreading with @xmath41 .",
    "these properties can be more conveniently reformulated by introducing for each directed bond from @xmath42 to @xmath43 a current @xmath44 , so that the energy continuity equation holds in the following form : @xmath45 for the fpu-@xmath0 model such a current observable is given by @xmath46 obviously , @xmath47 .",
    "we next introduce the energy current - current correlation function @xmath48 then @xmath49 note that @xmath50 . clearly , if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 . on the other hand , if @xmath53 for large @xmath37 with @xmath20 , then @xmath54 , and the spreading is superdiffusive .",
    "the problem of regular versus anomalous energy transport may thus be rephrased as whether @xmath55 decays integrably or not .",
    "unfortunately , such a reformulation is of little help . to estimate the decay of a time correlation in equilibrium , such as @xmath55 ,",
    "is an exceedingly difficult problem .",
    "however , in the limit of small @xmath56 , through methods from kinetic theory , @xmath55 may be expressed in a more accessible form .",
    "for the complete argument we refer to @xcite . here",
    "we only state the small @xmath56 form of @xmath57",
    ". to do so will require some preparation .",
    "but the goal of our contribution is to estimate the decay of @xmath55 for the fpu-@xmath0 chain in the limit of small @xmath56 .    at @xmath58 ,",
    "the system reduces to the harmonic hamiltonian @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has the dispersion relation @xmath60 here we use the convention that the discrete fourier transform yields @xmath61-periodic functions , and also declare that the term `` periodic function '' always refers to a function which is @xmath61-periodic in all of its arguments",
    ". it will be convenient to choose as the basic periodic cell the interval @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , then @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "on @xmath65 the dispersion relation is simply @xmath66 and thus also for all @xmath67 , @xmath68 and we let arbitrarily @xmath69 .",
    "we also introduce @xmath70 for @xmath71 . with these conventions the linearized collision operator of the fpu-@xmath0 lattice in the kinetic limit",
    "is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 periodically extended from @xmath65 to @xmath74 , see @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 describes the collision of two phonons , where @xmath76 label the incoming momenta and @xmath77 , @xmath78 label the outgoing momenta , thus by fiat satisfying momentum conservation modulo @xmath61 . through the @xmath79-function",
    "the collisions are also constrained to conserve energy .",
    "note that at this stage , the definition in ( [ eq : defl ] ) is only formal since no prescription is given of how to deal with the @xmath79-function .",
    "it turns out to be useful to consider @xmath80 as a linear operator on @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being understood as the multiplication operator by the function @xmath82 .",
    "we will prove later that @xmath83 is a bounded positive operator with a decomposition @xmath84 where @xmath85 is compact and @xmath86 is a multiplication operator .",
    "now we are in a position to state the conjectured behavior of @xmath55 for small coupling @xmath56 .    * kinetic conjecture : *  _ for any @xmath87 and temperature @xmath25 @xmath88 \\omega ' \\big\\rangle } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 denotes the scalar product in @xmath81 .",
    "( a more detailed discussion about the scaling factors can be found in @xcite . ) _",
    "thus for small @xmath56 , the decay of @xmath90 is obtained from the spectral properties of @xmath83 , certainly a more accessible item than the full hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "our goal here is to study the behavior of the kinetic correlation function @xmath91    in kinetic theory , it is a common practice to use the relaxation time approximation , which in our case amounts to dropping the operator @xmath85 , that is , to approximate @xmath92 as we will show , @xmath93 , and for @xmath94 , @xmath95 behaves asymptotically as @xmath96 .",
    "thus the relaxation time approximation predicts @xmath97 for large @xmath37 , as has been derived in @xcite .",
    "@xmath83 has the range of @xmath86 as its essential spectrum .",
    "in particular , the essential spectrum starts from @xmath98 .",
    "thus it is not obvious that the asymptotics predicted by the relaxation time approximation is really the correct one . to understand the time decay leads to two distinct mathematical issues .",
    "[ it : collinvar ] the so called collisional invariants , which in essence are zero modes of @xmath75 , could in principle prevent @xmath99 from decaying to @xmath98 . to exclude such a possibility",
    ", we have to characterize all collisional invariants , which involves solving a non - trivial functional equation .",
    "we will use the resolvent expansion to estimate @xmath100 . in our case",
    ", it turns out to be necessary to make the expansion to the second order , yielding @xmath101 the first term is identical to the relaxation time approximation , and behaves as @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "the second and third term will be shown to be @xmath104 for any @xmath105 .",
    "although also this second contribution is divergent , the first term is dominant , and thus we confirm the prediction of the relaxation time approximation in this particular case .",
    "an inherent difficulty in resolvent expansions is the estimation of the remainder term , such as the last term in ( [ eq : resolv1a ] ) .",
    "our method bears some similarity to the birman - schwinger estimates used in quantum mechanics .",
    "it relies on the fact that the resolvent expansion is made up to an even order , as well as on the operator @xmath106 being compact .",
    "in fact , it is likely that similar techniques can be used to study many of the cases where a decomposition @xmath107 , with @xmath108 and a compact @xmath109 , is possible , although we would expect the optimal order for the resolvent expansion to vary from case to case .",
    "the exact order , as well as the exact power of the decay , would naturally depend also on the function @xmath110 .",
    "a reader interested in such generalizations is invited to jump ahead to the proof of the main theorem in section [ sec : resolv ] .",
    "our results imply that , on the kinetic time scale , the energy spread is superdiffusive , with @xmath111 , @xmath112 , for large @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to a heat conduction exponent @xmath113 and is in agreement with the molecular dynamics simulations of @xcite .",
    "as the example of long time tails in classical fluids teaches us , kinetic theory might miss the true asymptotic decay of equilibrium correlation functions . whether this is the case",
    "also for the fpu-@xmath0 chain , remains a challenge for the future .    from the point of view of kinetic theory ,",
    "our result is fairly surprising .",
    "usually linearized collision operators have a spectral gap implying exponential decay of the current - current correlation function , and diffusive spreading for the corresponding conserved quantity .",
    "in fact , we are not aware of any other boltzmann type kinetic model which would exhibit superdiffusive spreading .",
    "we would like to thank walter aschbacher , laurent desvillettes , antti kupiainen , michael loss , clment mouhot , andrey pereverzev , and gennadi vainikko for useful comments and references .",
    "many of these exchanges happened during a stay at the erwin schrdinger international institute for mathematical physics ( esi ) , vienna , austria , whom we thank for their hospitality .",
    "this work has been completed as part of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) project sp  181/19 - 2 .",
    "to define @xmath75 , we first need to find all solutions to the energy constraint .",
    "the solution manifold to @xmath114 , is clearly non - empty , as there are the _ trivial solutions _",
    "@xmath115 we will later prove in corollary [ th : ysols ] that , in addition , there is a solution @xmath116 , and that all other solutions are modulo @xmath61 equal to one of these three . for @xmath117",

    "we extend @xmath118 to @xmath122 by defining @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "this choice makes @xmath118 everywhere continuous while ensuring that for all @xmath125 , we still have @xmath126 .",
    "the energy conservation @xmath79-function can then be formally resolved by integrating over some chosen direction : for instance , choosing the @xmath127-integral for this purpose would yield for any @xmath128 and for any continuous periodic function @xmath129 , @xmath130 however , this procedure is somewhat suspect here , as it will lead to terms of the type @xmath131 , related to the trivial solutions and canceled only due to symmetry properties .",
    "an additional difficulty lies in the application of the definition to functions @xmath129 which are not continuous but merely @xmath132-integrable . to put the definition of @xmath75 on a firmer ground",
    ", we will resort to a different approach in section [ sec : fpuopdef ] : we replace @xmath79 in ( [ eq : defl ] ) by a regularized @xmath79-function @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and then show that there is a unique self - adjoint operator @xmath75 which agrees with these operators in the limit @xmath135 .",
    "our choice of regularization for the @xmath79-function is not completely arbitrary : in the kinetic limit of lattice systems with random mass perturbations the corresponding @xmath79-function also appears via a sequence of @xmath136-functions ( see , for instance , proposition a.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "a somewhat lengthy computation , to be discussed in sections [ sec : fpuopdef ] and [ sec : fpuoperator ] , shows that the formal procedure explained before is essentially correct : the trivial solutions give no contribution , and the unique limit operator @xmath75 is @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are integral operators determined by the integral kernels @xmath140 which are defined for @xmath141 using the auxiliary functions @xmath142 in addition , @xmath143 denotes a multiplication operator by the function @xmath144 @xmath75 was already used as the linearized collision operator in @xcite .",
