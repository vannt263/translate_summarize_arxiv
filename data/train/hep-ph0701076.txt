    "the notion of the intrinsic charm ( ic ) content of the proton has been introduced over 25 years ago in refs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in the light - cone fock space picture @xcite , it is natural to expect a five - quark state contribution to the proton wave function . the probability to find in a nucleon the five - quark component @xmath3 is of higher twist since it scales as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath6-quark mass @xcite .",
    "this component can be generated by @xmath7 fluctuations inside the proton where the gluons are coupled to different valence quarks . since all of the quarks tend to travel coherently at same rapidity in the @xmath8 bound state , the heaviest constituents carry the largest momentum fraction . for this reason , one would expect that the intrinsic charm component to be dominate the @xmath6 -quark production cross sections at sufficiently large bjorken @xmath2 .",
    "so , the original concept of the charm density in the proton @xcite has nonperturbative nature and will be referred to in the present paper as nonperturbative ic .",
    "a decade ago another point of view on the charm content of the proton has been proposed in the framework of the variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) @xcite .",
    "the vfns is an approach alternative to the traditional fixed flavor number scheme ( ffns ) where only light degrees of freedom ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) are considered as active .",
    "it is well known that a heavy quark production cross section contains potentially large logarithms of the type @xmath11 whose contribution dominates at high energies , @xmath12 . within the vfns",
    ", these mass logarithms are resummed through the all orders into a heavy quark density which evolves with @xmath13 according to the standard dglap @xcite evolution equation .",
    "hence the vfn schemes introduce the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the heavy quarks and change the number of active flavors by one unit when a heavy quark threshold is crossed .",
    "we can say that the charm density arises within the vfns perturbatively via the @xmath14 evolution and will call it the perturbative ic .",
    "presently , both perturbative and nonperturbative ic are widely used for a phenomenological description of available data .",
    "( a recent review of the theory and experimental constraints on the charm quark distribution can be found in refs .",
    "see also appendix  [ exp ] in the present paper ) .",
    "in particular , practically all the recent versions of the cteq @xcite and mrst @xcite sets of pdfs are based on the vfn schemes and contain a charm density .",
    "at the same time , the key question remains open : how to measure the intrinsic charm content of the proton ?",
    "the basic theoretical problem is that radiative corrections to the fixed order predictions for the production cross sections are large . in particular , the next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    "corrections increase the leading order ( lo ) results for both charm and bottom production cross sections by approximately a factor of two at energies of the fixed target experiments .",
    "moreover , soft gluon resummation of the threshold sudakov logarithms indicates that higher - order contributions are also essential .",
    "( for a review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbative instability leads to a high sensitivity of the theoretical calculations to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters .",
    "for this reason , it is difficult to compare pqcd results for spin - averaged cross sections with experimental data directly , without additional assumptions . the total uncertainties associated with the unknown values of the heavy quark mass , @xmath5 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the pdfs are so large that one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the pqcd predictions for production cross sections @xcite .",
    "since production cross sections are not perturbatively stable , it is of special interest to study those observables that are well - defined in pqcd .",
    "a nontrivial example of such an observable was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite where the azimuthal @xmath1 asymmetry in heavy quark photo- and leptoproduction has been analyzed  . in particular , the born level results have been considered @xcite and the nlo soft - gluon corrections to the basic mechanism , photon - gluon fusion ( gf ) , have been calculated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the production cross sections , the azimuthal asymmetry in heavy flavor photo- and leptoproduction is quantitatively well defined in pqcd : the contribution of the dominant gf mechanism to the asymmetry is stable , both parametrically and perturbatively .",
    "therefore , measurements of this asymmetry would provide an ideal test of pqcd . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the azimuthal asymmetry in open charm photoproduction could have been measured with an accuracy of about ten percent in the approved e160/e161 experiments at slac @xcite using the inclusive spectra of secondary ( decay ) leptons .    in the present paper",

    "our main result can be formulated as follows :    * contrary to the basic gf component , the ic mechanism is practically @xmath1-independent .",

    "apart from two trivial misprints uncovered in @xcite for @xmath60 , a complete agreement between all the considered results is found .",

    "contrary to the production cross sections , the @xmath61 asymmetry in charm azimuthal distributions is practically insensitive to radiative corrections at @xmath62 .",
    "perturbative stability of the combined gf+qs result for @xmath45 is mainly due to the cancellation of large nlo corrections in eq .",
