    "it is only through understanding the physics of massive stars , their atmospheres , radiation , and evolution , that we will be able to make progress in many aspects of astrophysics . particularly important",
    "is the quantitative study of young starbursts , which are dominated by the effects of o - type and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "wr stars comprise only 10% of the massive stellar content in the galactic mini - starburst , ngc3603 , yet they contribute 20% of the total ionizing flux and 60% of the total kinetic energy injected into the ism ( crowther & dessart 1998 ) . in order",
    "that young starbursts can be properly studied , both nearby , and at high - redshift , it is crucial that the properties and evolution of o - type and wr stars spanning a range of initial metallicities are determined . in this review , i will consider recent theoretical progress in wr analyses that has been made towards this goal , focusing especially on spectroscopic and ionizing properties .",
    "quantitative analysis of w - r stars represents a formidable challenge , since their stellar winds are so dense that their photospheres are invisible , so that the usual assumptions of plane - parallel geometry and local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) are wholly inadequate .",
    "a minimum requirement is to consider non - lte in an extended , expanding atmosphere for multi - level atoms . at present , three independent model atmosphere codes are capable of routinely analysing the spectra of wr stars , considering complex model atoms of hydrogen , helium , nitrogen , carbon and oxygen , developed by w .-",
    "hamann ( potsdam ) , w.  schmutz ( zurich ) and d.j .",
    "hillier ( pittsburgh ) , the latter also implemented by p.a .",
    "crowther ( london ) and f.  najarro ( madrid ) .",
    "each code solves the radiative transfer problem in the co - moving frame , subject to statistical and radiative equilibrium , including the effects of electron scattering and clumping .",
    "overall , consistency between results from these codes is very good .",
    "schmutz and hillier have also accounted for line blanketing by heavy elements .",
    "individual calculations are computationally demanding , so that a large parameter space can not be readily explored .",
    "consequently , computationally quick codes have been developed which solve the transfer problem in the sobolev approximation and assume a wind temperature distribution ( e.g. de koter et al .",
    "1997 ; machado , these proc . )",
    "de marco et al .",
    "( these proc . )",
    "compare the predictions of the code by de koter with that of hamann for wc stars .",
    "in the simplest case , the stellar properties of wr stars are derived from the following diagnostics : two spectral lines from adjacent ionization stages of helium ( heii @xmath15412 and hei @xmath15876 most commonly ) , plus the absolute magnitude in a standard filter ( typically @xmath2 ) and the terminal wind velocity ( @xmath3 ) , often measured from uv resonance lines .",
    "the default number of model parameters available is therefore four , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "stellar temperatures for extended atmospheres are related to the inner boundary of the model atmosphere ( generally around rosseland optical depth @xmath7@xmath820 ) , which often deviates significantly from the ` effective ' temperature , at @xmath7=2/3 ( hamann 1994 ) .",
    "schmutz et al .",
    "( 1989 ) identified the so - called transformed radius ( @xmath9 ) , a measure of wind density , which relates @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 so that almost identical spectra are produced for fixed @xmath9 , reducing the number of free parameters . in this way",
    ", a large number of wr stars in the galaxy and magellanic clouds have been analysed by hamann and co - workers , comparing observed line equivalent widths to interpolations of large model grids ( see hamann , these proc . ) .",
    "however , actual wr stars are not pure helium stars , so that the contribution of other elements is necessary .",
    "it was soon established that the wind properties of wr stars were affected by the presence of metals , notably carbon and nitrogen ( hillier 1988 ; 1989 ) .",
    "for wn stars , metals are trace elements ( @xmath81% in nitrogen by mass ) , so pure he analyses compare relatively well with those additionally including carbon and nitrogen , which control the outer wind properties . in late - type wn ( wnl )",
    "stars hydrogen contributes significantly ( up to @xmath850% in extreme cases ) .",
    "determination of atmospheric contents requires detailed analysis of individual stars through a comparison between theoretical line profiles ( e.g. h@xmath10 for hydrogen ) and spectroscopic observations ( e.g. crowther et al .",
    "in wc stars , it was soon realised that pure he studies were inadequate to obtain reliable stellar properties , since carbon mass fractions are @xmath84050% ( hillier 1989 ) .",
    "wc analyses need to use he and c diagnostics simultaneously in order that the stellar and chemical properties may be determined .",
    "the degree of complexity in atomic data handled for carbon has a great influence on predicted line strengths ( hillier & miller 1999 ) .",
    "= 13.0 cm    this technique has a major disadvantage in that it is time consuming and computationally expensive .",
    "nevertheless , derived stellar properties can be considered robust , while model deficiencies may be readily identified .",
    "studies of individual stars have now been performed for galactic , magellanic cloud and other local group wr stars using 4 m class ground - based telescopes ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "1995 in m33 ) .",
    "source confusion becomes problematic at large distances from ground - based observations ( 0.@xmath118 corresponds to a scale of 3 parsec at the modest distance of m33 ) .",
    "although helium and carbon diagnostics are combined to derive the properties of wc stars , the majority of wn studies use solely helium .",
    "early results for weak - lined , early - type wn ( wne ) stars led to surprisingly low stellar temperatures ( e.g. hamann et al .",
    "1995 ) , which were comparable with wnl stars instead of strong - lined wne stars .",
    "crowther et al .",
    "( 1995b ) demonstrated that the stellar temperatures of weak - lined wne stars are in line with strong - lined examples , if nitrogen diagnostics ( e.g. niv @xmath14058 , nv @xmath1460320 ) are used instead of helium .",
    "results from helium are more straightforward , since the availability and quality of its atomic data is superior to nitrogen .",
    "however , hei lines are typically formed at large radii from the core , and are extremely weak in hot wr stars , with the exception of 10830  that is observationally challenging .",
    "in contrast , niv - v lines originate from the inner wind and are readily observed .",
    "consequently , nitrogen ought to serve as a more sensitive diagnostic of the stellar temperature , and circumvent the problem identified by moffat & marchenko ( 1996 ) .",
    "they noted that stellar radii derived from he analyses were _ greater _ than the orbital radii of some short period wr+o binaries .",
    "discrepancies for wn stars are not restricted to he and nitrogen diagnostics ( see e.g. crowther & dessart 1998 ) .",
    "hamann & koesterke ( 1998a ) have recently re - analysed a large sample of galactic wn stars and arrived at similar conclusions to crowther et al .",
    "( 1995b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the stellar temperatures and luminosities of wn stars obtained by alternative helium and nitrogen diagnostics are compared .",
    "consistent results are obtained for wnl stars , while higher temperatures and luminosities are obtained from nitrogen diagnostics for wne stars , especially weak - lined stars . differences in derived temperatures may be large , increasing by a factor of up to two ( from 36kk to 71kk for the wn5(h ) star wr49 ) .",
    "the change in luminosity is greater still  increasing by a factor of six in this star because of the sensitive dependence of bolometric correction ( b.c . ) with temperature .",
    "parameters derived from helium or nitrogen lines should be fully consistent , so that discrepancies indicate that something is missing in current models .",
    "perhaps clumps in the wind affect the ionization balance in the hei line forming region of wne stars  this may also be relevant to the ( poorly predicted ) strength of hei p  cygni absorption components .",
    "_ whatever the cause , care should be taken when comparing results obtained from different spectral diagnostics_.    detailed analyses of wc - type stars have also been carried out ( e.g. koesterke & hamann 1995 ; grfener et al .",
    "1998 ) using helium , carbon and occasionally oxygen diagnostics . however , the additional number of free parameters ( c / he , o / he ) has restricted the sample analysed to date , and oxygen diagnostics lie in the near - uv , requiring space based observations ( hillier & miller 1999 ) .",
    "since the uv and optical spectra of wc stars are dominated by overlapping broad emission lines , it is difficult to assign suitable continuum windows",
    ". analyses typically consider the continuum and line spectra in isolation , namely that interstellar extinctions are obtained by matching continua to de - reddened observations , while theoretical line profiles are compared to normalized spectra .",
    "a less error - prone approach is the comparison between de - reddened fluxed observations and synthetic spectra , accounting for line overlap . in this way , erroneously defined continuum windows ( e.g. at heii @xmath15412 , hillier & miller 1999 ) , and unusual uv extinction laws , may be identified .",
    "studies discussed above rely exclusively on optical ( or occasionally uv ) spectral diagnostics .",
    "the first infra - red ( ir ) spectroscopy of wr stars was obtained by williams ( 1982 ) , although recent advances mean that this wavelength region can now be used to observe a large sample of wr stars , particularly those obscured at shorter wavelengths .",
    "crowther & smith ( 1996 ) have assessed the reliability of ir analyses of wr stars by studying two wne stars for which uv and optical data sets were also available .",
    "they found that results from exclusively near - ir observations were in good agreement with optical studies , and with later infra - red space observatory ( iso ) spectroscopy for wr136 ( r.  ignace , priv .",
    "bohannan & crowther ( 1999 ) have recently compared optical and ir analyses of of and wnl stars .",
    "quantitative ir studies of wn - like stars at our galactic centre have recently been presented ( e.g. najarro et al .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of these stars are relatively cool , so that the sole k - band heii diagnostic at 2.189@xmath12 m is unavailable . without a second ionization stage , a unique temperature may not be obtained , so that mass - loss rates and abundances are uncertain .",
    "dessart et al .",
    "( these proc . )",
    "attempt to solve this by using the stronger heii 3.09@xmath12 m line in the thermal ir as a temperature diagnostic .",
    "another limitation with the k - band is that the prominent hei line at @xmath12.058@xmath12 m is strongly affected by ( metallicity dependent ) line blanketing effects , as shown by crowther et al .",
    "( 1995a , 1998 ) .",
    "problems with the quantitative analysis of low temperature stars are neatly summarised by hillier et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the galactic early b - type supergiant hde316285 .",
    "they obtained a wide range of possible mass - loss rates and surface h / he abundances for this star , despite the availability of high quality optical and near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "model calculations so far discussed use @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 , plus elemental abundances as free parameters",
    ". however , observational evidence suggests that presently assumed quantities , such as the velocity law and homogeneity may be inappropriate .",
    "in addition , it is well known that line blanketing by thousands of transitions in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) need to be incorporated into calculations .",
    "each additional relaxation adds ( at least ) one new variable parameter to the existing set .",
    "consequently , of the several hundred wr stars thus far analysed quantitatively , to date studies of only two have included assorted elements , a variety of velocity laws , clumping and line blanketing ( schmutz 1997 ; hillier & miller 1999 ) .",
    "generally , a uniform form of the radial velocity field ( @xmath13 ) is assumed , of exponent @xmath14=1 .",
    "tailored analysis are required to test alternative laws .",
    "unfortunately , different velocity forms are frequently able to reproduce the observed spectrum equally well ( hillier 1991a ) .",
    "in some cases , specific exponents produce optimum agreement , provided with a suitably large range of spectroscopic observations . from a careful comparison of the optical and far - red appearance of the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) p  cygni , najarro et al .",
    "( 1997b ) found that a @xmath14=4.5 law provided the best match .",
    "including mid - ir iso observations led to a revision to @xmath14=2.5 ( najarro et al .",
    "unfortunately , a long wavelength observational baseline is rarely available .",
    "schmutz ( 1997 ) went a stage further by _ deriving _ the form of the velocity law in wr6 from hydrodynamics , at least in the outer visible part of the wind , with @xmath14=3 . as a indication of the reliability of this approach ,",
    "the emission profile of hei @xmath110830 was reproduced better than in previous studies .",
    "wr winds are known to be inhomogeneous , from both observational and theoretical arguments ( willis , these proc . ) .",
    "however , homogeneity has been assumed by the majority of atmosphere studies to date .",
    "consideration of electron scattering  causing a frequency redistribution of line photons  provides the key to spectral synthesis ( hillier 1984 ; 1991b ) .",
    "homogeneous models often overestimate the strength of electron scattering wings relative to the overall emission line intensity .",
    "since free - free emission and radiative recombination both scale as the square of the density , whereas the electron scattering opacity scales linearly with density , estimates of wind inhomogenities may be estimated by varying volume filling factors and mass - loss rates so that line profiles and electron scattering wings are simultaneously reproduced . in line transfer calculations performed to date ,",
    "several simplifying assumptions are made , namely that models are composed of radial shells of material , with no inter - clump medium .",
    "the variation of clumping factor with radius taken into consideration in some cases since radiative instabilities are not expected to be important in the inner wind .",
    "schmutz ( 1997 ) and hillier & miller ( 1999 ) have estimated mass - loss rates of wr6 and wr111 which are a factor of 34 lower than those resulting from homogeneous models .",
    "hamann & koesterke ( 1998b ) have also applied an identical approach to a sample of four wr stars , with similar results obtained .",
    "substantially lower mass - loss rates of wr stars has importance in evolutionary model calculations and in reducing the momentum ( alternatively opacity ) problem of driving wr winds ( gayley et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "= 13.0 cm    to date , all spectroscopic studies have assumed spherical symmetry .",
    "evidence from spectropolarimetry indicates that this is appropriate for @xmath885% of cases ( harries et al .",
    "1998 ) . for the remaining stars , density ratios of 23 are implied from observations .",
    "future calculations will need to consider departures from spherical symmetry .",
    "indeed , the wind of the prototypical wne star wr6 is grossly asymmetric .      observations of the forest of iron lines in the uv spectra of wr stars , demonstrate the large influence that line blanketing by fe - group elements has on the emergent spectrum .",
    "the neglect of blanketing reveals itself through inconsistencies of model fits , and results from comparison with ionized nebulae . the principal problem in accounting for line blanketing is being able to handle the effect of tens of thousands of line transitions in the radiative transfer calculations . to date ,",
    "solely schmutz and hillier have made allowance for blanketing , albeit using different techniques , each with their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "monte carlo sampling by schmutz ( 1997 ) allows the opacity of a huge number of lines to be considered , although spectral synthesis of individual features in the uv is not possible , while the reverse is true for hillier & miller ( 1998 ) who use a ` super - level ' approach , treating the transfer problem correctly .    in fig .",
