    "according to the standard model ( sm ) , in @xmath0 collisions at the tevatron top quarks can be created in pairs via the strong force , or singly via the electroweak interaction . due to",
    "its higher cross - section and smaller associated backgrounds , the strong production ( @xmath1 ) represents the main channel used for performing detailed measurements of the properties of the top quark . in terms of its decay",
    ", a top quark is expected to disintegrate into a @xmath2 boson and a @xmath3-quark almost 100% of the time .",
    "thus , the top candidate events can be classified based on the subsequent decays of the @xmath2 daughter into : a ) `` dilepton '' events if both @xmath2 bosons decay leptonically , b ) `` lepton+jets '' events if one @xmath2 decays leptonically and the other one hadronically , and c ) `` all hadronic '' events if both @xmath2 s decay hadronically . the last category of top candidates ( all hadronic ) are typically dominated by multijet background contributions , and will not be used in the results described here . in the following sections , we will present the results from top charge measurement , as well as measurements related to the production and the decay of top quarks .",
    "while the top charge is expected to be @xmath4 , there are models which include an exotic @xmath5 top quark that couples to a right - handed @xmath3 quark @xcite and decays into a negative @xmath2 boson and a @xmath3 quark .",
    "both the cdf and d   experiments have performed measurements to test if the top charge is @xmath6 or @xmath5 .",
    "the challenge is therefore to reconstruct the charges of the @xmath2 bosons and the @xmath3 quarks in the event , and subsequently pair the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 s to reconstruct the top decay chain . in the cdf analysis , dilepton and lepton+jets",
    "top candidate events are selected by first requiring evidence for the leptonic decay of a @xmath2 : an electron ( muon ) with large transverse energy @xmath7(@xmath8)@xmath920 gev and large transverse missing energy from the undetected neutrino : @xmath1020 gev .",
    "for the lepton+jets subsample , three jets with @xmath1120 gev and a fourth jet with @xmath1112 gev are required . to further reduce background contamination , at least two of these jets are required to be identified ( tagged ) as @xmath3-jets using displaced vertex information as measured by the cdf silicon vertex detector . in the case of the dilepton subsample , the presence of another high transverse momentum",
    ", opposite - sign lepton is demanded , along with the presence of at least two jets with @xmath1115 gev .",
    "of the two jets , one or both should have been tagged as @xmath3-jets by the silicon detector . a minimum threshold of 200 gev on the total transverse energy in the event ( scalar - sum including @xmath12 ) is also imposed .",
    "the charge of the @xmath3-jets is determined by performing a @xmath13-weighted is the projection of track s momentum along the jet axis . ]",
    "sum of the charges of the tracks found within a cone of radius @xmath140.4 around the jet axis .",
    "a negative ( positive ) weighted sum indicates a @xmath3 ( @xmath15 ) quark . for real @xmath3-jets present in cdf data",
    "this method have been shown to determine the correct charge roughly 60% of the time .",
    "finally , the pairing of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in dilepton events is performed by computing the invariant mass of the lepton and @xmath3-jet ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this mass can be abnormally high for the wrong combinations ; the cdf pairing exploits this fact , first by requiring one combination over a certain threshold and then choosing the opposite @xmath17 pairing .",
    "this procedure was estimated to have a 95% success rate , with an efficiency of 39% . in lepton+jets events , a kinematic fitter @xmath18 using reconstructed top and @xmath2 mass constraints is calculated and the lowest @xmath18 combination is retained .",
    "the correct pairing is found 86% of the time , with an efficiency of 53% .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in figure [ chgplot ] .",
    "these results favour the sm hypothesis over the @xmath5 top charge hypothesis .",
    "the latter hypothesis is rejected at 87% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "we note that a top charge measurement has previously been performed by the d   collaboration @xcite with similar conclusions .",
    "at the fermilab tevatron , the top pairs are expected to originate predominantly from a @xmath19 initial state : @xmath21% @xmath22 85% , with somewhat large ( @xmath23%))uncertainties .",
    "two cdf measurements @xcite attempt to measure the production cross section ratio .",
    "the first measurement takes advantage of the large correlation between the average number of gluons and the average number of low @xmath8 charged particles present in a given sample .",
    "the @xmath2 + 0jet sample and the dijet ( 80 - 100gev ) sample are then used to extract the distributions of the low-@xmath8 track multiplicity in the  no - gluon `` case , and the ' ' gluon - rich \" case , respectively ( figure [ combo ] ) .",
    "these two templates are used in a simple maximum likelihood fit to derive the fractions of the no - gluon and the gluon - rich events present in the cdf data .",
    "after background subtraction is performed , it is found that @xmath24(stat)@xmath25(syst ) .",
    "the other cdf measurement of the production mechanism relies on an artificial neural network ( ann ) designed to separate events originating from @xmath19 and @xmath20 initial state .",

    "the d  collaboration has recently published the first measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry in top production @xcite . while a small asymmetry of the order of 5% is expected to arise from qcd calculations @xcite",
    ", several new physics phenomena could drastically increase this asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath27 is defined as the count ratio @xmath28 , where an event is counted as forward ( backward ) if the rapidity difference @xmath29 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "this measurement is performed in the reconstructed @xmath1 rest frame .",
    "the results are shown in table [ dtab ] . while the values of the asymmetry are somewhat higher than their expected values ( a few percent , depending on jet channel ) they also have sizable uncertainties , and are therefore in statistical agreement with these expectations .",

    "a 650 gev top - color - assisted signal @xcite is shown by the white contribution stacked on top of the sm expectation ( open histogram ) .",
    "the data are found to agree well with the sm expectation .",

    "one can see that a leptophobic @xmath43 with a width @xmath44%@xmath45 is excluded ( 95% c.l . ) up to a mass of 760 gev .",
    "a similar search at cdf observes no significant evidence for new particles decaying to @xmath1 . using the lepton+@xmath46 jets sample ,",
    "the cdf collaboration has also measured the differential top pair production cross - section in bins of @xmath39 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ alis ] where a good agreement between cdf data ( points ) and expected distribution ( histogram ) is apparent . to quantify this agreement ,",
    "a  p - value \" , defined as the fraction of sm simulated experiments which look as discrepant as the data or worse , is calculated ; the result of 0.45 confirms no excess over sm prediction is observed .",
    "other resonance searches in the top sector at the tevatron include @xmath47 searches and scalar top searches .",
    "the cdf collaboration has performed a search for a hypothetical new quark , @xmath47 , whose decay features the same final state particles as the sm top .",
    "the @xmath47 particle could belong to a fourth quark generation in which the mass of the @xmath48 partner is large enough to satify : @xmath49 ; in this case , @xmath47 would decay predominantly into @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the variables used to discriminate the @xmath47 signal from the associated background ( which includes sm @xmath1 production ) are the @xmath47 reconstructed mass @xmath52 and the total transverse energy in the event @xmath53 .",
    "a simultaneous analysis of these variables excludes the presence of a @xmath47 signal up to a mass of 284 gev ( at 95% c.l . ) .",
    "searches for scalar top quarks ( stop ) have been performed by both the cdf and d  collaborations .",
    "because of the large top mass , the mixing between the stop eigenstates can be substantial , and the lighter stop @xmath54 could be lighter than the top quark @xcite .",
    "the d  search focuses on this scenario in which @xmath55 pairs are produced and subsequently decay as @xmath56 .",
    "the final state therefore resembles that of @xmath1 production , with some additional missing energy from the neutralinos .",
    "multivariate likelihood discriminants are built for six models , defined by @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in all cases , no significant evidence of a signal",
    "is found , and upper limits are set on the cross section of these models , ranging from 7 - 12 times the theoretical calculations ( at 95% c.l . ) .",
    "the cdf analysis @xcite draws similar conclusions .",
    "the v@xmath59a structure of the weak current @xmath60 requires the following helicity fractions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for the longitudinal , left - handed , and right - handed @xmath2 contributions , respectively .",
    "an @xmath64 value significantly different from zero would indicate the presence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the d  collaboration has recently published @xcite results from the measurement of the fractions of @xmath2 helicity contributions using the @xmath65 * variable .",
    "* is the angle between the top quark and the lepton from @xmath2 decay , measured in the @xmath2 boson rest frame . ]",
    "both the dilepton and the lepton+jets subsamples are used for this measurement .",
    "the @xmath66 and @xmath64 fractions are fitted simultaneously , while @xmath67 is constrained to @xmath68 .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in figure [ heli ] : @xmath69(stat)@xmath70(syst ) and @xmath71(stat)@xmath72(syst )    the cdf collaboration has employed a three - prong approach for performing this measurement .",
    "the first two methods rely on the cosine of the decay angle @xmath73 * of the charged lepton in the @xmath2 rest frame measured with respect to the direction of motion of the @xmath2 boson in the top - quark rest - frame .",
    "fitting for both @xmath66 and @xmath64 fractions simultaneously and combining the two analyses , cdf obtains @xmath74(stat+syst ) and @xmath75(stat+syst ) .",
    "the third method relies on the matrix element technique previously developed in run i @xcite . in this measurement",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath67 fractions are fixed to zero and 1-@xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the method yields @xmath76(stat)@xmath77(syst ) .",
    "the results from the three cdf methods are summarized in figure [ heli ] .",
    "to summarize , the d  and cdf results are compatible with each other and with the sm expectations .",
    "more data will be needed for a conclusive determination of the three polarization fractions .          in the sm ,",
    "the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath78 is predicted to occur at a tiny rate @xmath79 ; however , several scenarios involving physics beyond the sm could enhance this branching ratio up to values of the order @xmath80 .",
    "thus , any sign of this rare decay at the tevatron would be an indication of new physics .",
    "a cdf search for @xmath78 decays is based on a template fit to a @xmath81 variable using kinematic constraints present in the top fcnc events ; one of these constraints is that the reconstructed mass of the @xmath82 system approach the top mass , within a small window .",
    "the subsample used for this study is the @xmath834 jets , where the @xmath34 decayed to a pair of oppositely - charged electrons or muons .",
    "the analysis of the kinematic @xmath81 reveals no significant evidence for a signal beyond the sm .",
    "a feldman - cousins approach yields the tightest constraint to date in this top decay channel : @xmath84% at 95% c.l .",
    "charged higgs bosons are predicted in many extensions of the sm , such as supersymmetry or grand unified symmetries if these bosons have massed below that of the top quark , the process @xmath85 would lead to a decrease in the sm branching ratio br(@xmath86 ) assumed to be very close to unity within the sm .",
    "the d  collaboration has considered a purely leptophobic model in which br(@xmath87=100% , and the mass of the charged higgs is close to the @xmath2 boson mass .",
    "such a model would decrease the measured @xmath1 cross - section in the lepton+jets channel , while leaving the dilepton @xmath1 cross section unchanged . using the ratio between the top pair cross section measured in the dilepton and the lepton+jets subsamples , one",
    "can then derive upper bounds on br(@xmath88 . at 95% c.l .",
    "this upper limit is br(@xmath890.35 .",
    "the cdf collaboration has also search for charged higgs bosons from top decays .",
    "as opposed to the d  approach , the cdf analysis seeks to exploit the difference between the dijet mass spectra from the regular @xmath2 decays @xmath90 and the charged higgs decays @xmath91 .",
    "invariant dijet mass templates are built for higgs masses ranging between 90 and 150 gev .",
    "no significant deviation from the sm is observed , and limits are set for the br(@xmath92 as function of the charged higgs mass .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limits on this branching ratio vary between 0.32 ( @xmath93 gev ) and 0.08 ( @xmath94 gev ) .",
    "we presented selected results from the studies of the properties of the top quarks at the tevatron .",
    "both the d  and the cdf collaborations have very mature and diversified top physics programs .",
    "the large amounts of data accumulated by the two experiments allow an unprecedented precision for most sm and beyond the sm measurements in the top sector . for updates of these results and numerous other top - quark - related measurements ,",
