    "recently , goto _ et al . _ have succeeded in the direct observation of the isolated vacancy in high - purity crystalline silicon ( si ) , with extremely low vacancy concentration believed less than @xmath7 @xmath8 , through the ultrasonic measurements at low temperature@xcite .",
    "they have measured the elastic constants of two type samples , non - doped si , and boron ( b)-doped si and observed reciprocal temperature dependence below 20 k down to 20 mk , called elastic softening , without the sign of the local distortion@xcite .",
    "the softening of non - doped si is independent of the external magnetic fields up to 10 t , while that of boron ( b)-doped si is suppressed by the external magnetic fields of the order of 1 t. they have claimed that ( 1 ) the softenings are cause by the isolated vacancy groundstates with 3-fold orbital degeneracy coupled to the ultrasound and ( 2 ) non - doped si has the non - magnetic neutral charge state @xmath9 and b - doped si has the charge state @xmath10 with the valence @xmath2 and the spin 1/2@xcite .",
    "based on the standard theory of vacancy@xcite established in 1980 s , the groundstate degeneracies for both @xmath11 and @xmath1 states are resolved with symmetry lowering due to the jahn - teller distortion in contrast to the newly observed softening .",
    "to understand such anomalous softenings , new approaches focusing on the quantum many - body effect have been performed on the basis of cluster model for the dangling - bond orbitals in a si vacancy in a couple of years@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite have revealed that the effect of couplings between electrons and jahn - teller phonons as well as that of coulomb interaction in the dangling bonds play crucial roles for the electronic states of both @xmath1 and @xmath11 states .",
    "matsuura and miyake@xcite have studied the effects of spin - orbit interaction and the coulomb interaction , and have found that the @xmath12 quartet groundstate , which is responsible for the magnetic suppression of the softening in b - doped si , is realized in the @xmath1 state by assuming a negative value of the spin - orbit coupling on the vacancy state @xmath13 , although the explicit calculation for @xmath14 has not been done so far .    in the cluster model calculations mentioned above , the effect of the spatial extension of the vacancy state , which is important to determine the absolute value of the elastic softening , has not been considered . in our previous paper@xcite",
    ", we have investigated the electronic state around a single vacancy in infinite si crystal on the basis of the green s function approach , and found that the @xmath15 triplet vacancy states are widely extended up to 20  and are responsible for the extreme enhancement of the curie constant of the quadrupole susceptibilities resulting in the elastic softening at low temperature .",
    "the curie constant for the trigonal mode is considerably larger than that for the tetragonal mode as observed in the ultrasonic experiments@xcite .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit interaction , however , has not been considered there .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to elucidate the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on the widely extended vacancy states . for this purpose , we extend our previous study@xcite for the case with the ls coupling @xmath16 on each si atom , and then we calculate the spin - orbit splitting in the vacancy state @xmath17 by using the green s function approach .",
    "we also consider the effect of couplings between electrons and jahn - teller phonons in the dangling bonds within the second order perturbation .",
    "our model hamiltonian consists of the tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian @xmath18 with ls - coupling on each si site and a vacancy potential @xmath19 , and explicitly given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a creation operator for an electron at site @xmath22 and orbital @xmath23 ) with spin @xmath24 , and",
    "@xmath25 is that for wave vector @xmath26 and band @xmath27 ) . in first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : htb ] ) , the tb parameters @xmath28 are written by the slater - koster parameters and determined so as to fit the tb band energies @xmath29 to the lda band energies@xcite for the si crystal , and explicitly given in ref @xcite .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ eq : htb ] ) represents ls - coupling on each si site with ls - coupling constant @xmath16 which is experimentally determined as @xmath30@xcite . here , the spin - orbit matrix @xmath31 is @xmath32 the vacancy potential @xmath19 excludes electrons from the vacancy site by raising the energy levels @xmath33 for the orbitals belong to the vacancy site . for @xmath34 ,",
    "no electron exists at the vacancy site and then an effective vacancy state is realized .    in the absence of the vacancy ( @xmath35 ) , the green s function for the perfect crystal is described as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the eigenvector for the energy band @xmath29 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : htb ] ) and orbital @xmath38 with spin @xmath24 , @xmath39 . in the presence of the vacancy ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the green s function is obtained by solving the dyson s equations which can be written in the @xmath41 matrix representation as @xmath42 , with the vacancy potential matrix @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the green s function for @xmath35 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) and @xmath45 is the corresponding green s function for @xmath40 . in the limit @xmath46 , @xmath47 with @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 , and then @xmath50 . by using this relation ,",
    "@xmath51 is obtained by @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "we calculate @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) by performing the @xmath55 summation with up to @xmath56 mesh points and obtain @xmath51 . when @xmath57 , a remarkable localized level is found in the band gap and the total weight of this state is found to be 6 by summing the contribution to this level from all sites .",
    "therefore , we find that this level corresponds to the @xmath15 states with the 6-fold spin - orbital degeneracy with the energy @xmath58 .",
    "this localized level is occupied by two electrons in the @xmath9 state and by one electron in the @xmath10 state , respectively .    by introducing the ls coupling on each si atom ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "the @xmath15 states split into @xmath4 doublet groundstates and @xmath5 quartet excited states with a spin - orbit splitting on the vacancy states @xmath60 as shown in fig.[fig : so1 ] . in fig.[fig : so2 ] , the energy levels for the vacancy states , @xmath58 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 measured relative to the valence band top , are plotted as functions of the inverse of total number of k - points @xmath63 .",
    "then , we obtain a @xmath64 extrapolated value of the spin - orbit splitting on the vacancy states as @xmath65 which is of order of @xmath66 of the spin - orbit splitting on si atom @xmath67@xcite .",
    "therefore , the spin - orbit coupling on the vacancy states @xmath14 becomes extremely small as compared to @xmath0 but is positive only due to the effect of spatial extension of the vacancy state .",

    "the explicit results will be shown in a subsequent paper@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic state around a single vacancy in infinite si crystal on the basis of the green s function approach . when the ls coupling @xmath0 on each si atom is taken into account ,",
    "the @xmath15 states with the 6-fold spin - orbital degeneracy for the @xmath1 state split into @xmath4 doublet groundstates and @xmath5 quartet excited states with a reduced splitting energy of @xmath70 .",
    "we have also considered the effect of couplings between electrons and jahn - teller phonons in the dangling bonds within the second order perturbation and find that the groundstate becomes @xmath5 quartet which is responsible for the magnetic - field suppression of the softening in b - doped si .    in the present study",
    ", we have assumed that the @xmath71-point symmetry is preserved in a single vacancy in infinite si crystal . even in this case , the lattice relaxation with keeping the @xmath71-point symmetry might take place .",
    "therefore , we have also investigated the effect of symmetry preserving lattice relaxation on the spin - orbit splitting in the vacancy states @xmath17 by using the first - principle calculation with supercell method , and have found that @xmath17 is positive in a single vacancy with an unitcell with 63 si atoms @xcite . to be more conclusive ,",
    "we need further investigation to determine the explicit value of @xmath17 with a larger size of supercell .    the effect of the electron correlation , which is considered to be important to determine the many - body groundstate in a si vacancy as discussed from the cluster model calculations @xcite , has not been considered in this paper .",
    "the effect can be discussed by including the selfenergy corrections on the basis of the present green s function approach and will be discussed in near future .",
