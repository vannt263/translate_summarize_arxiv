    "the nature of the disorder - driven solid - solid vortex phase transition in high temperature superconductors has been an intriguing issue in physics of the vortex matter @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that proper characterization of this transition must take into account effects of transient disordered vortex states ( tdvs ) paltielnature , paltielprl , gillerprl , andrei , gillerjap , vanderbeeksc , konczy , kupfer , dimasc , beenarapid , beenabrief , beenammm .",
    "these transient states are inevitably created by injection of vortices through inhomogeneous surface barriers while the external magnetic field increases @xcite , or by  supercooling  of the disordered vortex phase while the field decreases @xcite .",
    "the existence of such transient states is indicated in time resolved magneto - optical measurements by the appearance of a sharp change ( break ) in the slope of the induction profiles @xcite . when the external field is kept constant ,",
    "the break moves with time towards the sample edges or center , indicating annealing of the injected or supercooled tdvs , respectively gillerprl , beenarapid , beenabrief .",
    "the existence of tdvs near the disorder - driven vortex phase transition , clarifies several long standing puzzles , such as the apparent increase of the transition induction with time konczy , kupfer , beenarapid , beenabrief , beenammm , the apparent termination of the transition line below a certain temperature beenarapid , beenabrief , yesh - bont , wen , yet the appearance of the transition over a longer time beenarapid , beenabrief , beenammm , yesh - bont , tamegai , anders , wen , and smearing of the first order nature of the transition @xcite .",
    "although some aspects of the tdvs have been analyzed dimatheory , indenbom , so far no comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of tdvs , and its influence on the measured transition , has yet been reported . at the experimental front",
    ", research efforts have been mainly directed towards eliminating the transient effects , e.g. by utilizing the corbino disk configuration in transport measurements @xcite and the vortex dithering technique in magnetic measurements avrahamnature .",
    "these sophisticated experiments successfully uncovered the underlying thermodynamic order - disorder vortex phase transition . in this work",
    "we investigate , both experimentally and theoretically , the dynamics of the transient disordered vortex states , and utilize this knowledge to extract the thermodynamic order - disorder vortex phase transition line .",
    "we present comprehensive time resolved magneto - optical measurements in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath2 ( bscco ) , demonstrating continuous injection of transient vortex states while ramping up the external magnetic field , annealing of injected transient states while keeping the external field constant , and annealing of transient supercooled disordered states while ramping down the external field . in all these experiments the tdvs exhibit front - like propagation , or retreat , with a velocity depending on the rate of change of the external field , the creep rate and the annealing time @xmath4 of the transient states .",
    "the dynamic behavior of the front is quantitatively analyzed in terms of competition between two mechanisms , namely generation and annealing of tdvs .",
    "this analysis enables extraction of the annealing time @xmath3 , characterizing the tdvs , as a function of the induction @xmath5 and temperature @xmath6 .",
    "we show that knowledge of @xmath8 enables the extraction of the thermodynamic vortex order - disorder transition line , @xmath9 .",
    "the extracted @xmath9 line is significantly different from the apparent transition lines commonly measured from the onset of the second magnetization peak , ignoring effects of tdvs .",
    "measurements were performed on a 1.55@xmath101.25@xmath100.05 mm@xmath11 bi@xmath1sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath2 single crystal ( @xmath12 92 k ) .",
    "the crystal was grown using the traveling solvent floating zone method motohira .",
    "this crystal was specially selected for its uniformity of flux penetration and was checked by magneto - optical imaging before and after it was cut into a rectangle . in the course of measurements ,",
    "magneto optical ( mo ) snapshots of the induction distribution across the sample surface were recorded at time intervals of typically 40 ms , using iron - garnet mo indicator with in - plane anisotropy @xcite and a high speed ccd camera ( hamamatsu c4880 - 80 ) .",
    "the process of injection of tdvs through the sample edges by sweeping up the external field , was magneto - optically recorded at different sweep rates . in these experiments ,",
    "the sample was cooled down to the measuring temperature in zero field , then the external magnetic field , @xmath13 , was ramped up at a constant rate between 4 and 1600 g / sec , from zero to about 850 g. while the external magnetic field was ramped up , snapshots of the induction distribution across the crystal surface were taken successively at constant field intervals ( usually 10 g ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the induction profiles across the crystal width deduced from the magneto - optical images , taken at @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 , while the external field was ramped up at a rate of 53 g / sec .",
    "when @xmath13 reaches a value of approximately @xmath17 @xmath18 , a sharp change in the slope of the profile (  break  ) appears at @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath18 , indicating coexistence of two distinct vortex states , characterized by high and low persistent current densities : a high persistent current state near the sample edges and a low persistent current state near the center @xcite .",
    "the high persistent current state is identified as a tdvs , because it decays with time when the external field is kept constant ( see sec .",
    "iib below ) . when the external field is continuously increased , the break moves towards the sample center , indicating propagation of the transient disordered state  front deeper into the sample . at the same time , the induction at the break increases monotonically with a rate decreasing with time . as shown below ( see sec .",
    "iiia ) , these results can be explained in terms of competition between injection and annealing processes of tdvs .",
    "while the rate of injection remains approximately constant , the rate of annealing is high for low inductions , and decreases sharply as the induction increases towards @xmath22 .",
    "the first appearance of the break indicates a stage where the injection rate starts to overcome the annealing rate .    increasing the field sweep rate , or decreasing temperature at a constant sweep rate , shifts @xmath19 downwards , indicating that the injection process of tdvs starts to overcome the annealing process at lower inductions .",
    "the effect of increasing sweep rate is demonstrated in figure 2 , which shows the induction profiles measured at @xmath14 25k while ramping up the external field at 4 , 160 , and 800 g / sec . a rate increase from 4 to 160 g / sec , shifts @xmath23 down from @xmath24450 to @xmath24400 g. a further increase of the rate to 800 g / sec shifts",
    "@xmath19 down to @xmath24330 g. the effect of temperature on @xmath19 is demonstrated in figure 3 .",
    "for the same sweep rate of 160 g / sec , lowering temperature from @xmath25 @xmath16 to @xmath15 @xmath16 , shifts @xmath19 down from @xmath26 g to @xmath27 g. as temperature is further lowered to @xmath28 @xmath16 , @xmath19 is shifted down to @xmath29 g. figure 4 shows the velocity of the tdvs front as a function of time for different sweep rates , measured at @xmath30 @xmath16 .",
    "the initial velocity of the front ( the first appearing break ) is zero .",
    "it then accelerates with a decreasing rate , approaching a constant velocity determined by the rate of change of the external field .",
    "the annealing process of injected tdvs was magneto - optically recorded while keeping the external magnetic field at a constant level .",
    "injection of tdvs throughout the sample was accomplished by abruptly raising the external field to a target value between 140 and 850 g ( rise - time 50 ms ) . immediately after reaching the target value of the external field , magneto - optical snapshots of the induction distribution across the sample surface were recorded at time intervals of 40 ms for 4 seconds , and 300 ms for additional 26 seconds .",
    "figure 5 shows the time evolution of the induction profiles at t= 21 k after abruptly increasing the external field from zero to 465 g. initially , the profiles are smooth , without a break , indicating a single vortex phase throughout the sample .",
    "however , after approximately 0.5 second , a break appears in the slope of the induction profiles , progressing with time towards the sample edge .",
    "the break , ( a typical one is marked in the figure by an arrow ) , separates between a high persistent current state near the sample edge and a low persistent current state near the center .",
    "the high persistent current region near the edge shrinks with time , and therefore the vortex state in this region is identified as a transient disordered state .",
    "the vortex state in the expanding , low persistent current region near the center , is identified as the thermodynamic quasi - ordered phase gillerprl .",
    "the front of the growing thermodynamic phase moves initially with a large velocity and decelerates with time to zero velocity as shown in figure 6 , for @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath18 . after reaching zero velocity",
    ", the movement of the front reverses its direction , indicating an end of the annealing process and beginning of injection of tdvs into the sample interior .",
    "one would expect @xcite that this turning point is obtained when the induction at the front reaches the value of the thermodynamic vortex order - disorder transition induction @xmath33 .",
    "however , the data shows that the annealing process ceases at an induction of @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath18 , i.e. below @xmath36 @xmath18 ( see section iv ) .",
    "we show below ( section iiib ) , that the origin of this phenomenon is associated with the fundamental difficulty of realizing a pure annealing experiment ; while the external field is kept constant , disordered vortex states are continuously injected through the sample edges via flux creep . for inductions well below @xmath33",
    "the annealing rate is much larger , thus the thermodynamic quasi - ordered vortex state continuously grows .",
    "however , as the induction at the front approaches @xmath33 , the annealing rate continuously decreases until a point is reached when the rate of injection of tdvs due to flux creep equals the annealing rate . at this point  in time",
    "the growth of the thermodynamic quasi - ordered phase comes to an halt .",
    "after this point , the rate of injection of tdvs due to flux creep becomes larger than the annealing rate , and as a result tdvs are injected into the sample .",
    "this is manifested by the reverse movement of the front towards the sample center .      ",
    "supercooling  of a disordered vortex phase @xcite and annealing of the transient supercooled state were magneto - optically traced in field sweep down experiments . in these experiments , an external field of 850 g",
    "was initially applied for long enough time to ensure establishment of a disordered vortex phase .",
    "the field was then ramped down to zero at a constant rate between 4 and 1600 g / sec .",
    "while the external field was ramped down , snapshots of the induction distribution across the crystal surface were taken successively at constant field intervals ( usually 10 g ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the induction profiles taken at @xmath14 23 k , while the external field was ramped down at a rate of 16 g / sec . for external fields between 420 and 240 g",
    "the profiles exhibit a break , progressing into the sample interior with time .",
    "in contrast to fsu experiments , here the breaks appear at approximately the same induction , @xmath37 = 360 g , almost independent of the location in the sample . as before , the breaks reveal coexistence of a quasi - ordered vortex phase ( characterized by low persistent current density ) near the sample edges , and a tdvs ( characterized by high persistent current density ) , in the sample interior .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is strongly suppressed by increasing the sweep rate at constant temperature or decreasing temperature at a constant sweep rate , as demonstrated in figures 8 and 9 , respectively .",
    "obviously , in these experiments the source of the transient disordered state can not be associated with edge contamination , as flux does not enter the sample through its edges . moreover , the low @xmath38 quasi - ordered phase appears near the edges and propagates with time into the sample interior .",
    "the origin of the tdvs is rather supercooling of the high - field disordered state @xcite . as the field",
    "is rapidly lowered below the transition field , the  initial thermodynamically established disordered state is supercooled to inductions below @xmath33 and consequently the apparent solid - solid transition induction , @xmath37 , shifts below @xmath33 .",
    "as shown in figure 8 , larger sweep - rates induce deeper supercooling , shifting @xmath37 further down @xcite .",
    "figure 10 describes the front velocity as a function of time in fsd experiments at 23 k , for different sweep rates . for low sweep rates , the front moves at an approximately constant velocity , which depends on the rate of change of the external field . for high sweep rates ,",
    "the front movement accelerates with time .",
    "the experiments described above reveal different dynamic behaviors of the tdvs depending on the type of experiment ( fsu , fsd or constant field ) , the rate of change of the external field , the induction at the interface between the tdvs and the quasi - ordered thermodynamic phase , temperature and time . in this section",
    "we analyze these behaviors in terms of a competition between two fundamental processes : creation and annealing of tdvs .",
    "the parameter that plays a key role in our analysis is the annealing time , @xmath3 , of the transient disordered vortex state . in defining @xmath3",
    ", we refer to the annealing experiment described in section iib .",
    "we assume an initial tdvs throughout the whole sample , created , e.g. by a step increase of the external field .",
    "the annealing process begins  at @xmath39 with a nucleation of a quasi - ordered vortex phase at the sample center , and continues with front propagation of this phase towards the sample edges @xcite . in order to distinguish between normal magnetic relaxation and the annealing process of the tdvs",
    ", we assume that the disordered and quasi - ordered vortex states are characterized by _ time independent _ high and low current densities , @xmath40and @xmath41 , respectively . such an idealized annealing process is schematically described in figure 11a .",
    "_  _ let us examine a location @xmath42 in the sample where at @xmath39 the induction is @xmath43 and the current density is @xmath40 .",
    "the annealing time , @xmath7 , is defined as the time that it takes for the current density at @xmath42 to transform from @xmath40to @xmath44while the induction at @xmath42 remains constant and equal to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "formally ,",
    "@xmath45    where , @xmath46 is the nucleation time , @xmath47 is the front velocity under the conditions of constant external field @xmath13 and constant @xmath40and @xmath41 ; @xmath48 denotes the location of the sample center , where the thermodynamic quasi - ordered vortex phase starts to nucleate @xcite . according to eq.[definition of tau ] , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the induction at the sample center .",
    "equation [ definition of tau ] provides insight into the qualitative behavior of @xmath51 : for low induction @xmath5 , far below the transition induction @xmath33 , @xmath52is large @xcite , resulting in a short annealing time @xmath53 as @xmath33 is approached , @xmath52 decreases causing @xmath3 to increase . in a close vicinity of @xmath33 , @xmath54approaches zero , and consequently @xmath3 approaches infinity .    in the following subsections",
    "we analyze the dynamics of the transient vortex states in the three experiments described in section iii and show how @xmath3 can be extracted from each of these experiments .      in these experiments ,",
    "two competing processes take place simultaneously : a tdvs is continuously injected into the sample through its edges by the ramped external field and flux creep , and at the same time the annealing process takes place .",
    "this competition between injection and annealing of the tdvs determines the position , @xmath55 , of the front . in the framework of the critical state model",
    ", one can consider @xmath55 as a function of three independent variables @xcite : the external field , @xmath13 , the current density , @xmath56 , and the induction , @xmath37 , at the front ( see figure 12a ) :    @xmath57    thus ,    @xmath58    according to eq .",
    "[ definition of tau ] ,    @xmath59    thus ,    @xmath60    the meaning of this equation is as follows : the first term on the right hand side describes a continuous injection of tdvs by the change of the external field , pushing the front of the injected tdvs from the sample edge towards the sample center at a rate determined by the rate of change of @xmath13 ( see figure 11b ) . the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ vfupf ] describes slow injection , in the same direction , caused by flux creep ( note that @xmath61 ( see figure 11c)@xmath62the third term describes the annealing process , pushing the front in the _ opposite _ direction , i.e. towards the sample edge ( see figure 11a ) .",
    "the competition between the above three terms determines the dynamics of the front .",
    "initially , when @xmath13 starts to increase from a zero value , the inductions involved are far below @xmath33 , and thus @xmath63 is small ( for a schematic description of @xmath51 see figure 13 ) . as a result , the annealing term ( third term on the right hand side of eq . [ vfupf ] ) dominates , and the tdvs has no chance to propagate into the sample , i.e. the front is stuck at the sample edge . as @xmath13 increases , the induction at the edge increases towards @xmath33 , and the annealing term becomes  less and less significant , because the annealing time @xmath3 , as well as @xmath64 , continuously increase , approaching infinity as @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the front starts its journey from the sample edge towards its center with a zero velocity , and accelerates with time towards a final velocity determined by the rate of change of the external field ( neglect of the flux creep term in eq .",
    "[ vfupf ] is justified for large enough @xmath66 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath55 may reach the sample center , and thus disappear , before this final velocity is obtained .",
    "let us denote by @xmath19 the induction at the first detected front ; since @xmath67 , substitution of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "[ vfupf ] yields :    @xmath69    thus , measurements of @xmath19 for different rates of change of the external field yield @xmath64 as a function of @xmath5 . on the basis of these data",
    "one can calculate @xmath3 as a function of @xmath5 by integration :    @xmath70    since @xmath64 increases monotonically as @xmath33 is approached , eq .",
    "[ dtau / db ] implies that @xmath19 is shifted down to lower inductions as @xmath66 increases , in accordance with the experiment ( see figures 2 and 14 ) .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath37 can be analyzed by considering @xmath37 as a function of @xmath13 , @xmath56 , and @xmath55 ( see figure 12a ) :    @xmath71    thus :    @xmath72    when the front ( indicated by a break in the profile ) just appears : @xmath73 and @xmath74 thus @xmath75 , implying that @xmath76 starts to rise at a rate equal to the rate of change of the external field .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ dbf / dt ] , @xmath77 also contributes to an increase of @xmath78 with time , however for large @xmath66 this contribution is negligible .",
    "the contribution of the third term , @xmath79 @xmath80 is much more significant and it causes a continuous decrease of @xmath81 with time down to zero , which is obtained when @xmath82 reaches its final value @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "[ vfupf ] ) .",
    "thus , the increase of @xmath84 with time is translated into a decrease of @xmath78 with time .",
    "when flux injection due to flux creep is negligible , @xmath85 for @xmath86 as noted before regarding @xmath55 , @xmath37 may disappear before reaching its saturated value @xmath33 . in this case",
    ", the final value of @xmath37 will be @xmath87      for a constant @xmath13 , equations [ vfupf ] and [ dbf / dt ] become    @xmath88    and    @xmath89    in the absence of injection by the change of the external field , injection by flux creep becomes significant .",
    "thus , the terms @xmath90 and @xmath91 in eqs .",
    "[ vfaneal ] and [ bfaneal ] , respectively , may not be neglected .",
    "again , two competing processes may be recognized : injection of a tdvs by flux creep , pushing @xmath55 towards the sample center , and annealing of the tdvs , pushing @xmath55 @xmath92towards the sample edge .",
    "note that regarding @xmath93 , both processes contribute to an increase of @xmath37 with time . assuming that initially @xmath94 and @xmath37 is far below @xmath33 , the second term on the right hand side of eq.[vfaneal ] dominates ( i.e. the annealing process dominates ) , and the front starts its journey towards the sample edge with a maximum velocity given by @xmath95 as @xmath55 moves towards the sample edge , @xmath37 increases , and consequently @xmath96 increases .",
    "thus , the annealing process slows down , and @xmath55 decelerates until @xmath97 in the absence of the creep term in eq .",
    "[ vfaneal ] , @xmath68 would imply @xmath98 obviously , for @xmath37 close to @xmath33 , the injection by creep becomes significant and the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ vfaneal ] must be taken into account .",
    "this implies that @xmath99 at an induction @xmath100 _ smaller _ than @xmath33 satisfying the equation :    @xmath101    when this condition is fulfilled , @xmath37 continues to increase , beyond @xmath102 at a rate @xmath103 due to the flux creep ( see eq .",
    "[ bfaneal]).@xmath92for @xmath37 larger than @xmath104 the motion of",
    "the front reverses direction , i.e. @xmath105 , implying movement of the front towards the sample center .",
    "the key difference between field sweep down ( fsd ) and field sweep up ( fsu ) experiments is the source of the tdvs . unlike fsu experiments , in fsd experiments the tdvs are not injected through the sample edges , but created by  supercooling  of a previously established thermodynamic disordered vortex state .",
    "we assume that the ramping down of the external field begins at @xmath39 , from a large enough value , @xmath106 , so that initially the entire induction profile in the sample is above @xmath33 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath107    and the vortices in the entire sample are in a thermodynamic  disordered phase from @xmath39 up to @xmath108    @xmath109    when the induction at the sample edge equals @xmath33 . for @xmath110 , a supercooled",
    "tdvs begins to appear at the sample edge ; as the external field continues to drop , the front of the supercooled transient states penetrates deeper into the sample . at the same time the annealing process takes place .",
    "note that in contrast to the annealing experiments ( section iiib ) , in fsd experiments the annealing process starts at the sample _ edge ,  _ where the induction is smallest , and thus the lifetime of the supercooled tdvs is shortest .",
    "clearly , it will require infinitely long time to anneal the tdvs generated at the edge immediately after @xmath111 .",
    "however , as the external field is ramped down , the induction at the edge drops , and consequently the annealing time continuously decreases .",
    "thus , at a later time @xmath112 the induction at the edge drops to @xmath113 @xmath114 , and consequently , the annealing time decreases to @xmath115 .",
    "a quasi - ordered vortex state ( and thus the first front ) will appear at the sample edge when    @xmath116    this condition defines @xmath19 at the crossing point of  the  straight line @xmath117 plotted versus @xmath118 and the curve @xmath119 , ( see figure 13 ) .",
    "from the shape of the @xmath51-curve it is clear that as @xmath120 increases , this crossing point is shifted towards lower inductions @xmath5 .",
    "this is in accordance with the experiment , which shows that as the ramping rate increases the induction at the first detected break in the induction profile is shifted down ( see figures 8 and 14 ) .",
    "on the basis of eq .",
    "[ taudown ] , one can generate the @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 curve by measuring @xmath19 for different ramping rates of the external field .",
    "we note , however , that in this case a pre - determination of @xmath33 is required .",
    "once the front appears at the sample edge , its dynamics ( i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath121 versus time ) can be analyzed starting from an equation similar to eq .",
    "[ xfup ] ( see figure 12b ) :    @xmath122    using the same arguments as in the analysis of the fsu experiments , one obtains :    @xmath123    and    @xmath124    it is interesting to note that as far as @xmath55 is concerned , in fsd experiments the three factors involved , namely ramping down of @xmath13 , flux creep , and the annealing , all push @xmath55 in the same direction - towards the sample center .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of @xmath37 is governed by competing processes : both , ramping down of @xmath13 and flux creep push @xmath121 downwards ( @xmath125 , and @xmath126 ) , while the annealing process shifts @xmath37 upwards ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "thus , variations with time of @xmath55 relative to @xmath37 are much larger in fsd as compared to fsu experiments .",
    "this explains the outstanding qualitative difference between the induction profiles measured in fsd and fsu experiments , namely the apparent constancy of @xmath37 in fsd experiments as compared to fsu experiments .",
    "in order to follow the behavior of @xmath55 and @xmath37 with time , let us first ignore the contribution of flux creep ( second term on the right hand sides of eqs . [ vfdown ] and  [ dbf / dtdown ] ) . for relatively slow rate of change of @xmath127",
    "the first front appears at a relatively high induction , thus @xmath128 is large , and the third term on the right hand side of eq .",
