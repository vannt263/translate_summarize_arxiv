    "the eigenvalues obtained from the equation @xmath47 become functions of the flux @xmath0 . for each of them , at any value of the flux @xmath0 , excluding the value @xmath3 , the hopping integral @xmath48 starts flowing into a two - cycle fixed point for @xmath49 .        continuing this argument it is possible to discern a countably infinite number of discrete eigenvalues in the limit @xmath50 , and all corresponding to extended eigenstates in such a non - translationally invariant interferometer arrangement . by tuning the magnetic flux appropriately ,",
    "it is possible to ` place ' such eigenvalues at any desired location in the energy spectrum .",
    "such extended eigenstates can , in principle , lie arbitrarily close to the neighboring localized states .",

    "extended states arising from the other scales of length ( @xmath49 ) as solutions of the equation @xmath53 get densely packed in the energy spectrum , but do not form a continuum .",
    "absence of any kind of translational invariance makes the appearance of localized eigenstates a natural phenomenon .",
    "we highlight below some interesting variations of these localized states .",
    "let s refer back to the set of recursion relations eq .  .",
    "the roots of the equation @xmath54 yield an interesting result in the sense that , for any value of energy extracted out of this equation , the hopping integral @xmath55 remains non - zero upto the @xmath56-th stage of renormalization , and starts to decay beyond the @xmath56-th rsrg step .",
    "this implies that for such energy values the amplitudes of the corresponding wave function have a non - trivial distribution over a cluster of vertices of the spg - ab inteferometer .",
    "the size of the cluster increases with increasing value of the rsrg step @xmath26 from which the roots are extracted .",
    "that such energies indeed belong to the spectrum , has been verified by exhaustive calculation of the density of states . as the spg geometry is scaled by a scale factor of three , the size of the cluster over which the amplitudes of the wave functions have a non - trivial distribution typically gets enlarged in proportion of @xmath57 .",
    "clusters accommodating the non - trivial distribution of wave functions get decoupled from each other ( or , remain very weakly coupled at the most ) beyond a certain scale in such cases .    since the hopping integral @xmath55 starts flowing to zero beyond the @xmath56-th stage ,",
    "such wave functions are indeed localized , but the _ localization - area _ increases with increasing value of @xmath26 . in principle , for all such energy eigenvalues extracted out of the equation @xmath58 in the limit @xmath50 , we encounter a countable infinity of eigenfunctions which _ span _ the infinitely large interferometer and yet retain a localized character .",
    "the choice of the rsrg iteration index @xmath26 thus allows one to ` delay ' ( in space ) the onset of localization .",
    "we name such an effect as _ staggered localization _  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the case of the extended states , the eigenvalues corresponding to the staggered localized states depend on the flux @xmath0 from the beginning ( @xmath44 level ) , and the staggered localization can thus be controlled , at any scale of length , to occupy any desired place in the energy spectrum . in fig .",

    "if one sticks to the shaded branch only , one encounters either a situation where the hopping integral is zero from the very beginning .",
    "this is a trivial situation , except in one case of the so called _ extreme localization _ , as will be discussed immediately after this .",
