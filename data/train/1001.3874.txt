    "how bh seeds form and how they evolve into the supermassive variety has been the subject of many studies ( begelman & rees 1986 ) .",
    "a natural path to bh formation relies on the first generation of stars ( pop  iii ) born in metal free environments ( madau & rees 2001 ; volonteri et al .",

    "gravitational instabilities can indeed lead to a vigorous gas inflow into the very central region of protogalactic discs , supplying the necessary matter for the formation of bh seeds .",
    "the above scenarios have a common fundamental ingredient , i.e. , the gas hosted in the progenitor halo has not been polluted by metals .",

    "gravitationally unstable protogalactic discs whose gas is only mildly polluted by metals , can still produce strong gas inflows into their central regions .",
    "stars start to form in the central few pc where the gaseous mass has been accumulated and the densities are high enough for star formation to set in .",
    "clusters formed in this way are crowded places .",

    "the final fate of this very massive star is to collape into a bh with mass similar to its progenitor  as mass loss at low metallicity is negligible .",
    "one of the factors that regulate the competition , at a given redshift , between different formation scenarios is the metal enrichment history .",

    "this opens the possibility that different modes of bh seed formation co - exist in different regions of the universe at the same redshift , instead of being mutually exclusive . as the mean metallicity increases with cosmic time , growing bubbles of polluted gas where the first ncs and their bh seeds form , co - exist with relatively pristine regions where popiii star formation can still be feasible .",
    "this is the first of a series of papers in which we develop a model aimed at tracing self - consistently metal enrichment , following the hierarchical build - up of halos .",
    "we consider metal enrichment and radiative feedback from the first stars together with feedback of successive generations of stars .",

    "the stability of the disc is described in terms of the toomre parameter @xmath49 ( toomre 1964 ) . as the surface density increases since",
    "more cold gaseous mass is added to the disc , @xmath49 decreases and eventually drops below the critical value for disc stability @xmath50 .",

    "the inner density profile steepens inside a transition radius where a compact nuclear stellar cluster forms . * in those ncs where @xmath192 myr , core collapse anticipates stellar evolution and runaway collisions between the most massive stars build up a very massive star that finally implodes leaving a remnant bh seed .",
    "* the evolution continues and it is driven by the competition between star formation , triggered by prolonged cooling of hot halo gas and sn explosions that evacuate part of it .",

    "we compared our new prescriptions with the results of dv09 .",
    "the mean nc masses are found to decrease with decreasing redshift : higher metallicities usually correspond to larger star formation rates in the extended disc .",
