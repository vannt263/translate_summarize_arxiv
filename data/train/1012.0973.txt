    "graphene is considered to be a promising candidate for the spintronic applications recently,@xcite partly due to the perfect two dimensionality , gate - voltage - tunable charge carrier type and density,@xcite high mobility@xcite as well as the potentially long spin relaxation time limited by the small intrinsic spin - orbit and hyperfine couplings.@xcite from the high mobility and long spin relaxation time , a long spin relaxation length , favorable to the spin information transport and manipulation , is anticipated . however , both the spin relaxation time and transport length were experimentally found to be much smaller than expected.@xcite this suggests that the spin relaxation in the experiments is most likely to be contributed by extrinsic factors such as the possible impurity - enhanced spin relaxation@xcite via the elliot - yafet@xcite mechanism or the enhanced rashba spin - orbit coupling field@xcite from the impurities.@xcite the former case may exist in a highly dirty graphene sample and causes the spin relaxation time @xmath4 to be proportional to the momentum relaxation time @xmath5.@xcite however , for the latter case , the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin relaxation mechanism@xcite dominates and the relation @xmath6 is absent .",
    "in fact , recently pi _",
    "_ reported that @xmath4 increases with decreasing @xmath5 in the surface chemical doping experiment with au atoms on graphene,@xcite indicating that the dp spin relaxation mechanism is important there .",
    "however , the relation @xmath7 , valid when the dp spin relaxation mechanism is dominant and the scattering is strong enough , is not obeyed in their experiment.@xcite nevertheless , we will show that this deviation can be understood by taking account of the strengthening of the rashba spin - orbit coupling with the increasing coverage of au adatoms .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling , referred to as an extrinsic one , is due to the broken of the inversion symmetry which can be caused by either a perpendicular electric field , the interaction with substrate , or the atoms adsorbed on the surface.@xcite the contribution of the electric field to the rashba spin - orbit coupling is small ( @xmath8ev under a perpendicular electric field as large as 1  v / nm ) , @xcite while the adatoms can effectively enhance the rashba spin - orbit coupling to be of order of 10  mev by distorting the graphene lattice from @xmath2 to @xmath3 bonding structure.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the spin diffusion and transport limited by the dp mechanism in a graphene monolayer on sio@xmath0 substrate as presented by pi _",
    "et al._.@xcite to account for the short spin relaxation time ( @xmath970  ps ) before au doping in the experiment,@xcite we assume that the impurities inevitably present in the substrate , as well as the other effects such as the substrate - induced structure distortion , cause a strong rashba spin - orbit coupling . when the surface chemical doping by au atoms@xcite is performed , the rashba spin - orbit coupling coefficient @xmath10 is further strengthened . by fitting the chemical doping dependence of spin relaxation time from the experimental data,@xcite",
    "we obtain the chemical doping dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "it is found that @xmath10 increases approximately linearly with the density of adatoms when the latter is not too high . with",
    "this essential information obtained , we then study the spin diffusion and transport in the graphene layer .",
    "the method utilized in our study is the kinetic spin bloch equation ( ksbe ) approach which has been successfully applied to the study of spin dynamics in semiconductors.@xcite in the framework of this approach , the spatial spin precession frequency during the steady - state scattering - free spin diffusion ( assumed to be along the @xmath11-axis ) is@xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the dp term , @xmath14 is the external magnetic field and @xmath15 is the electron energy spectrum .",

    "this indicates that the inhomogeneous broadening is _ insensitive _ to temperature and electron density as long as @xmath10 is fixed .",
    "therefore the spin diffusion is only possible to be modulated effectively by the scattering.@xcite however , in this work it is revealed that when the scattering is strong enough ( just as in the graphene layer under study ) , the spin diffusion becomes insensitive to the scattering . as a result , the spin diffusion is uniquely determined by @xmath10 . moreover , the mean spin precession frequency @xmath24 shows a strong anisotropy which can also lead to the anisotropy of spin diffusion with respect to the spin polarization direction .",

    "<S> we investigate the spin diffusion and transport in a graphene monolayer on sio@xmath0 substrate by means of the microscopic kinetic spin bloch equation approach . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate causes a strong rashba spin - orbit coupling field @xmath1  mev , which might be accounted for by the impurities initially present in the substrate or even the substrate - induced structure distortion . by surface chemical doping with au atoms , </S>",
    "<S> this rashba spin - orbit coupling is further strengthened as the adatoms can distort the graphene lattice from @xmath2 to @xmath3 bonding structure . by fitting the au doping dependence of spin relaxation from pi _ et al . _ </S>",

    "<S> lett . * 104 * , 187201 ( 2010 ) ] , the rashba spin - orbit coupling coefficient is found to increase approximately linearly from 0.15 to 0.23  mev with the increase of au density . with this strong spin - orbit coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the spin diffusion or transport length is comparable with the experimental values . in the strong scattering limit ( dominated by the electron - impurity scattering in our study ) </S>",
    "<S> , the spin diffusion is uniquely determined by the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength and insensitive to the temperature , electron density as well as scattering . with the presence of an electric field along the spin injection direction </S>",
    "<S> , the spin transport length can be modulated by either the electric field or the electron density . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the spin diffusion and transport show an anisotropy with respect to the polarization direction of injected spins . </S>",
    "<S> the spin diffusion or transport lengths with the injected spins polarized in the plane defined by the spin - injection direction and the direction perpendicular to the graphene are identical , but longer than that with the injected spins polarized vertical to this plane . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy differs from the one given by the two - component drift - diffusion model , which indicates equal spin diffusion or transport lengths when the injected spins are polarized in the graphene plane and relatively shorter lengths when the injected spins are polarized perpendicular to the graphene plane . </S>"
