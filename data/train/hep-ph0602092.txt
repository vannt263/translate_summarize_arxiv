    "we just give a brief discussion on the nambu - goldstone current generation state @xcite , one - plane wave loff state @xcite , as well as the gluon phase @xcite .",
    "if we expand the thermodynamic potential @xmath179 of the non - linear realization form in terms of the nambu - goldstone currents , we will naturally have the nambu - goldstone currents generation in the system with the increase of mismatch , i.e. , @xmath181 and/or @xmath182 at large @xmath183 .",
    "this is an extended version of the nambu - goldstone current generation state proposed in a minimal gapless model in ref .",
    "@xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ lagr - nl ] ) , we can see that @xmath184 contributes to the baryon current .",
    "@xmath182 indicates a baryon current generation or 8-th gluon condensate in the system , it is just the one - plane wave loff state .",
    "this has been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - usloff ] .",
    "the other four nambu - goldstone currents generation @xmath181 indicates other color current generation in the system , and is equivalent to the gluon phase described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we do not argue whether the system will exprience a gluon condensate phase or nambu - goldstone currents generation state .",
    "we simply think they are equivalent .",
    "in fact , the gauge fields and the nambu - goldstone currents share a gauge covariant form as shown in the free propogator . however , we prefer to using nambu - goldstone currents generation than the gluon condensate in the gnjl model . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec - gnjl ] , in the gnjl model , all the information from unkown nonperturbative gluons are hidden in the diquark gap parameter @xmath185 .",
    "the gauge fields in the lagrangian density are just external fields , they only play the role of probing the system , but do not contribute to the property of the color superconducting phase . therefore , there is no gluon free - energy in the gnjl model , it is not clear how to derive the gluon condensate in this model . in order to investigate the problem in a fully self - consistent way",
    ", one has to use the ambitious framework by using the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite including diquark degree of freedom @xcite or in the framework of effective theory of high - density quark matter as in ref .",
    "@xcite .        except the chromomagnetic instability",
    ", the g2sc phase also exhibits a paramagnetic response to the perturbation of an external baryon current .",
    "this suggests a baryon current can be spontaneously generated in the g2sc phase , and the quasiparticles spontaneously obtain a superfluid velocity .",
    "the spontaneously generated baryon current breaks the rotational symmetry of the system , and it resembles the one - plane wave loff state .",
    "we further describe the 2sc phase in the nonlinear realization framework , and show that each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding pseudo nambu - goldstone current .",
    "we show this nambu - goldstone currents generation state can naturally cover the gluon phase as well as the one - plane wave loff state .",
    "we also point out that , when charge neutrality condition is required , there exists a narrow unstable loff ( us - loff ) window , where not only off - diagonal gluons but the diagonal 8-th gluon can not avoid the magnetic instability",
    ". the diagonal gluon s magnetic instability in this us - loff window can not be cured by off - diagonal gluon condensate in color superconducting phase .",
    "more interestingly , this us - loff window will also show up in some constrained abelian asymmetric superfluid system .",
    "the us - loff window brings us a new challenge .",
    "we need new thoughts on understanding how a bcs supercondutor will be eventually destroyed by increasing the mismatch , we also need to develop new methods to really resolve the instability problem",
    ". some methods developed in unconventional superconductor field , e.g. , high-@xmath166 superconductor , might be helpful .",
    "till now , the results on instabilities are based on mean - field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "the bcs theory at mf can describe strongly coherent or rigid superconducting state very well .",
    "however , as we pointed out in @xcite , with the increase of mismatch , the low degrees of freedom in the system have been changed .",
    "for example , the gapless quasi - particle excitations in the gapless phase , and the small meissner mass square of the off - diagonal gluons around @xmath186 .",
    "this indicates that these quasi - quarks and gluons become low degrees of freedom in the system , their fluctuations become more important . in order to correctly describe the system ,",
    "the low degrees of freedom should be taken into account properly .",
    "the work toward this direction is still in progress .",
