    "charmed baryon decays , in particular @xmath1 and @xmath0 decays , are of great interest as they serve as a platform for the study of strong and weak interactions in heavy - to - light baryonic transitions .",
    "they can also provide the essential inputs for the @xmath2 decay modes into a charmed baryon like @xmath1 . on the experimental side , most available results on @xmath1 decays",
    "are obtained using the old data until recently . in 2014 ,",
    "belle collaboration provided an measurement of the branching fraction with a very small uncertainty  @xcite , @xmath3 but the central value is much larger than the previous measurement by the cleo - c collaboration  @xcite : @xmath4 based on the large amount of data , belle collaboration also started to study the doubly cabibbo - suppressed processes  @xcite . making use of the data collected in the @xmath5 collision at the center - of - mass energy of @xmath6 gev and adopting the double - tag technique ,",
    "bes - iii collaboration has reported first measurements of absolute hadronic branching fractions of cabibbo - favored decay modes  @xcite . in total , twelve @xmath1 decay modes were observed with the significant improvement on the branching fraction in particular for the @xmath7 : @xmath8 while the uncertainties are comparable with the belle results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : belle_pkpi ] ) , its central value is much smaller , which is closer to the central value of the cleo results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cleo_pkpi ] ) .",
    "we believe this difference will be clarified in future since the experimental prospect on charmed baryon decays will be very promising  @xcite .    theoretical description of charmed baryon decays is mostly based on the factorization assumption together with the analysis of some non - factorizable contributions in nonperturbative explicit modes  @xcite .",
    "however the factorization scheme does not seem to be supported by experiments , for instance the observed large branching fraction for decays like @xmath9 , which are forbidden in the factorization scheme  @xcite .",
    "an alternative and the model - independent approach is to make use of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , which has been argued to work better in charmed baryon decays  @xcite and bottomed baryon decays  @xcite .",
    "as the experimental precision is gradually increasing , the time is ripe to validate / invalidate the applicability of the su(3 ) symmetry to charmed baryon decays .",
    "the su(3 ) transformation connects the @xmath1 with the @xmath0 .",
    "but at this stage and in the foreseeable future there is no experiment which will focus on the study on @xmath0 decays .",
    "thus the @xmath1 decays into various final states especially the ones into a neutron are of great value since they will be the only source for the test of the su(3 ) symmetry in charmed - baryon decays .",
    "the motivation of this work is to discuss the roles of the @xmath1 decays into a neutron into the test of su(3 ) symmetry and the exploration of final state interactions , including semileptonic decays , two - body and three - body nonleptonic decays .",
    "all these exclusive decay modes have not been experimentally measured yet .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semileptonic ] , the semileptonic @xmath1 decays are studied . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two_nonleptonic ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : three_nonleptonic ] , we will explore the two - body and three - body nonleptonic decays of the @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the last section contains our summary .",
    "we start with the semileptonic @xmath1 decays . in the flavor su(3 )",
    "symmetry limit , the charmed baryons are classified according to the su(3 ) irreducible representation , namely as multiplets of the light - quark system : @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath11 forms the charmed - baryon anti - triplet in the initial state : @xmath12 for the light baryons , we focus on the su(3 ) octet which is represented by the matrix : @xmath13 the operator responsible for the transition @xmath14 is @xmath15[\\bar \\nu_e \\gamma_\\mu(1-\\gamma_5 ) e]$ ] with @xmath16 , which forms an su(3 ) anti - triplet in the final state .",
    "thus the effective hamiltonian at hadron level is constructed as @xmath17 an implication of the above hamiltonian is obtained straightforwardly : @xmath18 measurements of the relevant branching fractions provide a most straightforward test of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry in charmed baryon decays . with the most recent data from the bes - iii collaboration  @xcite @xmath19 we can obtain the following result : @xmath20 which might be accessible for bes - iii and belle - ii collaborations  @xcite .    in semileptonic decays , the neutron can be produced together with a light pseudo - scalar meson .",
    "the lowest - lying pseudo - scalar meson can be written as @xmath21 in this case , the effective hadronic interaction hamiltonian is constructed as @xmath22 ( \\bar b^c_d m^d_c ) \\bar\\nu_{e } e +   b [ t^a \\bar b^b_a m^c_b   h_c(\\bar 3 ) ]    \\bar\\nu_{e } e + c [ t^a m^b_a \\bar b^c_b    h_c(\\bar 3 ) ]    \\bar\\nu_{e } e , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the singlet contribution to @xmath23 has been neglected .",
    "the @xmath24 are nonperturbative coefficients .",
    "the above hamiltonian leads to the expectation : @xmath25 which is testable in the near future .",
    "in fact , the above identity holds in the isospin symmetry , whose breaking effect is much smaller in the charm decays than that of the flavor @xmath26 symmetry . in the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath27 ,",
    "the isospins do not change , @xmath28 .",
    "it should be stressed here that this identity is applicable to both resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "the branching fraction for the inclusive decay of the @xmath1 into an electron has been measured as  @xcite @xmath29 combining the results for the @xmath30 in ( [ eq : lambdaenu ] ) , we may expect:@xmath31",
    "for two - body nonleptonic decays of the @xmath1 , there is no cabibbo allowed decay mode into a neutron .",
    "two - body decays into a neutron are either singly cabibbo suppressed , @xmath32 or doubly cabibbo suppressed , @xmath33    the nonleptonic @xmath1 decays are induced by the operators @xmath34[\\bar ud]$ ] for the cabibbo - allowed mode and @xmath35[\\bar ud]$ ] for the cabibbo - suppressed mode .",
    "these operators can be decomposed into irreducible representations of flavor su(3 ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal o}_{\\overline { 15 } } = \\frac{1}{2 } [ ( \\bar sc ) ( \\bar ud)+(\\bar u c ) ( \\bar s d ) ]",
    ". \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] perturbative qcd corrections give rise to an enhancement of the coefficient for the @xmath38 over the coefficient for the @xmath39 by  @xcite @xmath40^{18/23 }   \\left[\\frac{\\alpha_s(m_c)}{\\alpha_s(m_b)}\\right]^{18/25 }   \\sim 2.5 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if this is valid , then one has @xmath41 with @xmath42 for cabibbo - allowed modes , @xmath43 for singly cabibbo - suppressed modes , and @xmath44 for doubly - cabibbo - suppressed modes , where @xmath45 is the cabibbo angle , and @xmath46 the coefficients @xmath47 are the nonperturbative amplitudes .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil_two_non ] ) , we find that for the doubly - caibbo - suppressed modes : @xmath48 for the singly - cabibbo - suppressed modes , we have the decay amplitudes , @xmath49 which implies the relation : @xmath50    furthermore , we have the amplitudes for cabibbo - allowed modes : @xmath51 thus we can derive the sum rule that can be experimentally examined : @xmath52 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the recent bes - iii data  @xcite implies @xmath53   \\sim 0.9\\times 10^{-3}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] measurements in future by bes - iii will be able to validate / invalidate the dominance of the sextet assumption in the effective operator .",
    "compared to two - body decays , three - body @xmath1 decays are more involved , since first they can proceed via quasi - two - body process and the non - resonant decays and secondly there are a number of independent amplitudes in su(3 ) symmetry . in the following we consider the @xmath54 system in the isospin limit : @xmath55 where the superscripts @xmath56 and @xmath57 are isospin states from @xmath58 and @xmath59 couplings , respectively , which are independent with each other .",
    "since the hamiltonian of the @xmath60 transition has @xmath61 , and the isospin of @xmath62 is zero , we can derive the decay amplitudes from the above decompositions : @xmath63 the above amplitudes lead to the sum rule @xmath64 note that the isospin amplitudes in eq.([eq : isospin12 ] ) can be changed if we firstly couple the @xmath65 states from eq.([eq : isos]-[eq : isos1 ] ) , but the sum rule in eq.([eq : sumrule ] ) still holds .",
    "measurements of branching ratios of the three channels are able to determine the two amplitudes , and in particular investigate the relative strong phases between the two independent decay amplitudes .",
    "these phases arise from the final state interactions since if factorization works , the two independent amplitudes are real with vanishing phases at leading order",
    ". these amplitudes including phases can provide the essential inputs for the analysis of nonleptonic decays into other baryons like @xmath66 .    from eq.([eq : isospin12 ] ) , we define the relative strong phase , @xmath67 , between @xmath68 and @xmath69 : @xmath70 then the branching fractions can be expressed as @xmath71 where we consider the relative strong phase to understand the final state interaction , and neglect the phase spaces which are actually integrated in the three - body decays .",
    "hence @xmath72 defining @xmath73 we have @xmath74 from the recent measurement by besiii @xcite , @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath76 can be obtained once the @xmath77 is measured .",
    "the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is shown in fig.[fig : cosdelta ] . since @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 , and then the branching fraction of @xmath80 is obtained as , @xmath81 as we can see that this constraint is rather loose , thus the experimental measurements are requested .     and",
    "@xmath77 , with @xmath67 as the strong phase difference in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : phase ] ) and @xmath77 as the ratio of branching fractions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) . ]",
    "unlike the bottom hadron decays where the momentum transfer is typically large enough to ensure the perturbation theory in qcd , charmed meson and baryon decays are very difficult to understand . due to the limited energy release ,",
    "the factorization scheme based on the expansion of @xmath82 and @xmath83 is not always valid .",
    "flavor su(3 ) symmetry is a powerful tool to analyze the charmed baryon decays , which has been argued to work better than in charmed meson decays , however its validity has to be experimentally examined .",
    "since there is not much data on @xmath0 decays , exclusive @xmath1 decays into a neutron are essential for the test of flavor symmetry and investigating final state interactions in charmed baryon decays .    in this work , we have discussed the roles of the exclusive @xmath1 decays into a neutron in testing the flavor symmetry and final state interactions .",
    "we found that the semileptonic decays into a neutron provide the most - straightforward way to explore the flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "two - body nonleptonic decays are capable to examine the assumption of the sextet dominance mechanism .",
