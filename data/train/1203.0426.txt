    "1.5 cm     before continuing , some words about the approximation scheme are here in order : since the single  particle boson energy has cylindrical symmetry , @xmath108 , there is no reason to expect that the bosons will condense in only one particular momentum @xmath28 . in principle , the bosons @xmath80 could even condense in more than one mode @xmath77 as long as @xmath109 .",
    "however , such an approximation is the simplest one which allows us to verify whether a finite  momentum bec of magnetic excitons is indeed a stable phase via quite accurate and well controlled calculations .",

[ sec : discussion ] , we will discuss which of the features found here could be displayed by the bilayer qhs and also how the results derived from these two initial considerations could guide us to propose a more elaborated approximation scheme to study such a finite  momentum bec .",

    ", we would like to briefly recall the results from our first analysis of the effective boson model reported in ref .  .",
    "by setting @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the above equations , we recover eqs .",

    "[ fig : nzero](a ) .",
    "indeed , such a behavior of @xmath127 led us to include into the description the quartic terms in boson operators of the hamiltonian neglected in the bogoliubov approximation.@xcite considering these quartic terms in the so  called popov approximation,@xcite we showed that the self ",

    "note that the four configurations lie quite close in energy as @xmath9 increases , but the ground state energy curves never cross each other .",

    "it is clear that a finite  momentum bec is lower in energy than the zero  momentum bec discussed in the previous section for @xmath146 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath147 and @xmath148 curves cross at a ( small ) critical layer separation @xmath149 , indicating that a first ",

    "one important consequence of a finite @xmath134 is that the dispersion relation of the ( neutral ) quasiparticles is now gapped .",
