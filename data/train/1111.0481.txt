    "macromolecules which consist of a `` backbone '' polymer , to which flexible or stiff side chains are grafted , the so - called `` bottle brush polymers '' , find very great interest recently ( see refs  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "varying the chemical nature of both backbone chain and side chains , their chain lengths @xmath6 and the grafting density @xmath1 , the structure of these cylindrical molecular brushes can be widely varied .",
    "i.e. , their local  thickness \" as measured by the cross - sectional radius @xmath7 or linear dimensions of individual side chains can be varied as well as their local `` stiffness '' , traditionally measured by `` the '' persistence length @xmath8  @xcite , and their effective contour length @xmath9 .",
    "we here use quotation marks with respect to `` the '' persistence length , because there is evidence , at least for the case of very good solvent conditions , that a unique persistence length measuring the `` intrinsic '' stiffness of a polymer can not be defined in the standard fashion  @xcite .",
    "now an intriguing observation  @xcite is the sensitivity of the large - scale structure of these bottle brush polymers to solvent quality : one finds a thermally induced collapse of single macromolecules from cylindrical brushes to spheres , in a very small temperature range , and it is speculated that these bottle brushes could be useful as building blocks of `` soft nanomachines ''  @xcite .",
    "we also note that biopolymers with comb - like architecture are ubiquitous in nature ( such as proteoglycans  @xcite , or the aggrecane molecules that play a role in the soft lubricating layers in human joints  @xcite , etc . ) , and probably in this context temperature and/or solvent quality ( or ph value ) are relevant parameters as well .    in view of these facts ,",
    "a comprehensive clarification of how the properties of bottle brush polymers depend on solvent quality clearly would be interesting .",
    "although there are occasional experimental reports , how particular linear dimensions of these polymers scale in various solvents ( e.g.  @xcite ) , we are not aware of a systematic study of this problem . while work based on self - consistent field theory ( scft ) predicted already very early on  @xcite that the side chain gyration radius @xmath10 scales as @xmath11 for good solvents and @xmath12 for theta solvents , there is now evidence from experiment , simulation and theory that these power laws apply if at all only for side chain length @xmath2 of the order of @xmath13 , which are of no practical relevance : experiments have only studied the range @xmath14 , and the range accessible in simulations  @xcite is similarly restricted .",
    "numerical modeling applying the scheutjens - fleer version of scft has given clear evidence  @xcite that even within this mean - field approach @xmath15 is needed to reach the regime where the predicted power laws  @xcite apply . while the investigation of the scaling ( self - similar ) properties of bottle brushes with extremely long backbone chains and very long side chains may be a challenging theoretical problem , it is of little relevance for the experimentally accessible systems , and clearly not in the focus of the present paper .",
    "both scft theories  @xcite and scaling theories  @xcite consider ideal chains aiming to describe the behavior at the theta temperature , while previous simulations have almost exclusively considered the good solvent case only .",
    "notable exceptions are studies of globule formation of bottle brushes with very short side chains ( @xmath16 ) under poor solvent conditions  @xcite and the study of microphase separation of bottle brushes with straight backbones in poor solvent  @xcite .",
    "the present work intends to make a contribution to close this gap , by presenting a simulation study of a coarse - grained bead - spring type model of bottle brush polymers where the solvent quality is varied from very good solvent conditions to the theta point regime . in the next section",
    ", we shall describe the model and simulation technique , while in section iii we present our numerical results . in section iv ,",
    "a summary is given , as well as an outlook on pertinent experiments .",
    "extending our previous work on the simulation of bottle brush polymers with rigid backbones  @xcite , we describe both the backbone chain and the side chains by a bead - spring model  @xcite , where all beads interact with a truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential @xmath17 and nearest neighbors bonded together along a chain also experience the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the distance between the beads .",
    "thus @xmath20+c \\ , , \\qquad   r\\le r_c \\ , , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] while @xmath21 , and where @xmath22 .",
    "the constant @xmath23 is defined such that @xmath24 is continuous at the cutoff .",
    "henceforth units are chosen such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the boltzmann constant @xmath27 , and in addition also the mass @xmath28 of beads is chosen to be unity .",
    "the potential eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) acts between any pair of beads , irrespective of whether they are bonded or not . for bonded beads additionally the potential @xmath18 acts , @xmath29 \\ , , \\qquad   0 < r \\le r_0 \\ , , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] while @xmath30 , and hence @xmath31 is the maximal distance that bonded beads can take .",
    "we use the standard choice  @xcite @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "related models have been used with great success to study the glassification of polymer melts formed from short chains  @xcite and to study the effects of solvent quality of polymer brushes on flat planar substrates  @xcite . for such models of brushes on a planar substrate ,",
    "the implicit solvent model ( eq .  ( 1 ) ) has been compared with models using explicit solvent molecules , and it was found that the results are very similar .    note that in our model there is no difference in interactions , irrespective of whether the considered beads are effective monomers of the backbone or of the side chains , implying that the polymer forming the backbone is either chemically identical to the polymers that are tethered as side chains to the backbone , or at least on coarse - grained length scales as considered here the backbone and side chain polymers are no longer distinct .",
    "there is also no difference between the bond linking the first monomer of a side chain to a monomer of the backbone and bonds between any other pairs of bonded monomers .",
    "of course , our study does not address any effects due to a particular chemistry relating to the synthesis of these bottle brush polymers , but , as usually done  @xcite we address universal features of the conformational properties of these macromolecules .",
    "there is one important distinction relating to our previous work  @xcite on bottle brush polymers with rigid backbones : following grest and murat  @xcite , there the backbone was taken as an infinitely thin straight line in continuous space , thus allowing arbitrary values of the distances between neighboring grafting sites , and hence the grafting density @xmath1 could be continuously varied . for the present model , where we disregard any possible quenched disorder resulting from the grafting process , of course ,",
    "the grafting density @xmath1 is quantized : we denote here by @xmath34 the case that every backbone monomer carries a side chain , @xmath35 means that every second backbone monomer has a side chain , etc .",
    "chain lengths of side chains were chosen as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , while backbone chain lengths were chosen as @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious , of course , that for such short side chain lengths any interpretation of characteristic lengths in terms of power laws , such as @xmath43 , is a delicate matter , @xmath44 being an `` effective exponent '' and characterizes only the specified range of rather small values of @xmath2 , and not the limit @xmath45 considered by most theories  @xcite .",
    "thus , the actual value of @xmath44 is of limited interest , it only gives an indication to which part of an extended crossover region the data belong .",
    "however , we emphasize that ( i ) our range of @xmath2 nicely corresponds to the range available in experiments  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the analysis in terms of power laws with effective exponents is a standard practice of experimentalists in this context ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that for linear chains the theta temperature for the present ( implicit solvent ) model has been roughly estimated  @xcite as @xmath46 ( note , however , that there is still some uncertainty about the precise value of @xmath47 : for a similar model  @xcite the correct value of @xmath47 , @xmath48 in this case , could only be established for chain lengths exceeding @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus , in the present work we have thoroughly studied the temperature range @xmath50 . from previous work  @xcite on rather long chains in polymer brushes on flat surfaces , using the same model ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) ) to describe the interactions , it is known that for @xmath51 one finds a behavior characteristic for ( moderately ) good solvents .",
    "very good solvent conditions could be obtained from a slightly different model that has extensively been studied for standard polymer brushes  @xcite , where in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) the cutoff is chosen to coincide with the minimum of the potential , @xmath52 ( and then also @xmath53 can be chosen for this essentially athermal model ) .",
    "rather than carrying out simulations for bottle brushes using this model , we found it more appropriate to compare to the athermal version of the bond fluctuation model on the simple cubic lattice , which describes very good solvent conditions  @xcite and has been used in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the use of this model has several advantages : ( i ) due to the fact that excluded volume constraints can be monitored via the occupancy of lattice sites , a very efficient implementation of the pivot algorithm in this monte carlo approach has become possible  @xcite .",
    "therefore , very large bottle brush polymers can be equilibrated , up to @xmath54 , a task that is very difficult to achieve by molecular dynamics ( md ) methods ( ii ) the extent to which the bond fluctuation model and md results agree ( for comparable choices of parameters ) yields some insight to what extent the preasymptotic regime that we study is model dependent . of course , a truly universal behavior ( apart from amplitude prefactors ) can only be expected for the asymptotic regime where the side chain length @xmath45 , that is not accessible in simulations or experiments .",
    "one could ask why we do not use versions of the bond fluctuation model where an effective attraction between monomers is included  @xcite to study the effect of variable solvent quality in the framework of this model .",
    "the reason is that for temperatures slightly below the theta temperature already practically frozen configurations of monomers occur , with several monomers next to each other blocking any possibility to move .",
    "thus the convergence towards equilibrium then is extremely slow .",
    "however , since the application of the athermal version of the bond fluctuation model ( bfm ) to the simulation of bottle brush polymers is well documented ( hsu and paul  @xcite have given a careful discussion of the effort needed for the bfm to sample equilibrium properties . ) in the recent literature  @xcite , we do not give any details here .",
    "in the md simulation , the positions @xmath55 of the effective monomers with label @xmath56 evolve in time @xmath57 according to newton s equation of motion , amended by the langevin thermostat  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total potential acting on the @xmath56th bead due to its interactions with the other beads at sites @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath62 the associated random force .",
    "the latter is related to @xmath61 by the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath63 following previous work  @xcite we choose @xmath64 , the md time unit @xmath65 being also unity , for our choice of units .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) was integrated using the leap frog algorithm  @xcite , with a time step @xmath66 , and utilizing the gromacs package  @xcite . for the calculation of properties of the bottle brushes typically @xmath67",
    "statistically independent configurations are averaged over .    of course , for bottle brushes with large @xmath0 equilibration of the polymer conformations is a difficult problem .",
    "since we expect that end - to - end distance @xmath68 and gyration radius @xmath69 of the whole molecule belong to the slowest relaxing quantities , we studied the autocorrelation function of @xmath70 to test for equilibration , @xmath71 note that @xmath72 means an average of @xmath73 over the time @xmath74 in the md trajectory ( and the average @xmath75 is computed by averaging over @xmath67 statistically independent runs ) . despite a substantial investment of computer time",
    ", @xmath76 still exhibits significant fluctuations ( remember that quantities such as @xmath68 and @xmath69 are known to exhibit a `` lack of self - averaging  @xcite '' , irrespective of how large @xmath0 is ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives some examples for @xmath76 .",
    "if the number of samples would be infinite and @xmath77 , we should expect a monotonous decay of @xmath76 towards zero as @xmath57 becomes large .",
    "due to the fact that the number of samples is not extremely large , and @xmath78 not extremely small , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives clear evidence for noise that is still correlated .",
    "we see that for small @xmath2 the noise amplitude starts out at @xmath79 , and the time scale on which the fluctuations of @xmath76 change sign is at @xmath80 in ( a ) , @xmath81 in ( b ) , and @xmath82 in ( c ) . while in cases ( a)(b ) the ( statistically meaningful ) initial decay of @xmath76 occurs so fast that it can only be seen on a magnified abscissa scale ( inserts )",
    ", we see that in ( c ) the initial decay is also much slower , and the associated time scale is of the same order as the time over which fluctuations are correlated .",
    "we have carefully considered @xmath76 for all cases studied , and we have concluded that for our largest system studied ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , with a total number of @xmath83 effective monomers ) the statistical effort is not yet sufficient to allow meaningful conclusions on the overall linear dimensions of the bottle brush , while in all other cases the effort was judged to be sufficient . the damped oscillatory character of the relaxation seen particularly in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) could be a matter of concern ; we attribute this relaxation behavior to particular slow collective motions ( breathing type modes ) of the chain .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a small selection of snapshot pictures of equilibrated bottle brush polymers . from these snapshot pictures it is already clear that the side chains cause a significant stiffening of the backbone , at least on a coarse - grained scale , and that bottle brushes where @xmath0 is not very much larger than @xmath2 look like wormlike chains",
    "this conclusion corroborates pictures generated experimentally ( by atomic force microscopy or electron microscopy techniques , e.g.  @xcite ) , but this observation should not mislead one to claim that the kratky - porod wormlike chain model  @xcite often employed to analyze such micrographs provides an accurate description of bottle brush polymers , as we shall see .     of course , both the bead - spring model and the bfm are idealizations of realistic comb - branched polymers , where also bond - angle potentials and torsional potentials are present and contribute to the local chain stiffness .",
    "thus it is gratifying to note that nevertheless measured structure factors of real bottle brush polymers  @xcite can be mapped almost quantitatively to their simulated bfm counterparts  @xcite , if the lattice spacing is fixed at a length of a few angstroms , and about 3 chemical monomers are mapped onto two effective monomers of the bfm .",
    "residual minor discrepancies may to some extent be due to solvent quality effects  @xcite .",
    "fig .  [ fig3 ] presents log - log plots of the normalized mean square gyration radius of the side chains @xmath84 as a function of side chain length @xmath2 ( @xmath85 is the bond length between successive monomers ) , comparing data for grafting densities @xmath35 and @xmath86 , and two temperatures ( @xmath87 and @xmath51 , respectively ) .",
    "three different backbone lengths ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) are included , but the dependence of the data on backbone length is not visible on the scale of the graph .",
    "such a dependence on @xmath0 would be expected due to effects near the chain ends of the backbone : in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that there is less stretching of the side chains in the direction perpendicular to the backbone near the chain ends of the backbone than in the central part of the backbone . however ,",
    "this effect is almost completely compensated by the fact that side chains near the backbone chain ends are more strongly stretched in the direction of the backbone ( side chains then are oriented away from the backbone chain ends ) .",
    "this fact has already been seen for bottle brushes with rigid backbone but free ends  @xcite .",
    "we have also checked that for the bead spring model average side chain linear dimensions for bottle brushes with rigid and flexible backbones are identical for the bond fluctuation model , at least in the accessible parameter regime . for the bond fluctuation model",
    "a similar equivalence has been found also for the radial density profile of the monomers  @xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows then the temperature dependence of @xmath88 for the different choices of @xmath2 , demonstrating that the side chain extension is independent of @xmath0 and agrees well between rigid and flexible backbones .",
    "the small deviations observable between the rigid and the flexible backbone cases for large @xmath2 are due to residual systematic errors of the simulations for the flexible backbone .",
    "the present work therefore suggests that the equivalence between bottle brushes with rigid and flexible backbones carries over to chains in variable solvent quality , down to the theta point ( but we caution the reader that this equivalence will break down for poor solvents , in the regime of intermediate grafting densities where for rigid backbones pearl - necklace structures occur  @xcite ) .    the straight lines on the log - log plots in fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "illustrate the empirical power law @xmath89 consistent with corresponding experiments ( see  @xcite and references quoted therein ) and we find that @xmath44 decreases with decreasing solvent quality and with decreasing grafting density . in the good solvent regime , @xmath90  @xcite , the established value of the exponent describing the swelling of linear polymers under good solvent conditions , @xmath91 for @xmath45  @xcite . as expected , @xmath44 is still distinctly smaller than the value predicted from scaling  @xcite , @xmath92 or scft  @xcite , @xmath93 .",
    "but the slight enhancement of @xmath44 with respect to its value for free chains ( @xmath94 at the theta point , @xmath87 ; @xmath95 for good solvents ) is evidence that the side chains interact with each other , which is a prerequisite for the expected induced stiffening of the backbone chain .",
    "we now turn to the backbone linear dimensions . here",
    "we first caution the reader that in good solvent conditions we clearly also expect that the mean square end - to - end distance of a bottle - brush polymer satisfies the standard scaling relation @xmath96 but the longer the side chain length the larger @xmath0 must be chosen such that eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) can be verified .",
    "we start the discussion with data from the bond fluctuation model , where ( for @xmath97 ) data up to @xmath54 are available  @xcite .",
    "[ fig5 ] hence shows a log - log plot of @xmath98 ) versus @xmath2 .",
    "the factor @xmath99 in the denominator is arbitrarily chosen , since for gaussian chains ( @xmath94 ) the result would simply be the persistence length @xmath8 in units of the bond length  @xcite .",
    "thus , it was suggested  @xcite that in the excluded volume case one could introduce an effective persistence length @xmath100 via the definition @xmath101 then fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "can be interpreted as a plot of @xmath102 versus @xmath2 in the region where it is basically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the quantity @xmath100 defined in this way is compatible with an effective power law , @xmath103 but the effective exponent @xmath104 clearly depends on @xmath0 , if @xmath0 is not chosen large enough ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] clearly shows that @xmath100 is not a quantity characterizing the intrinsic stiffness of a bottle - brush polymer . for large @xmath0",
    ", the exponent @xmath104 seems to saturate at a value close to @xmath105 and @xmath106 for @xmath35 and @xmath86 , respectively , but for chain lengths @xmath0 in the range from @xmath107 to @xmath108 it is only in the range from @xmath109 to @xmath110 and from @xmath111 to @xmath112 for @xmath35 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "thus , it is no surprise that for the bead - spring model choosing @xmath40 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 values of this effective exponent @xmath104 in a similar range are found ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . of course",
    ", one must be aware that there is no strict one - to - one correspondence  @xcite between the meaning of chain lengths @xmath0 and @xmath2 in different models : actually there may be the need for conversion factors @xmath113 and @xmath114 between the bead spring ( bs ) model and the bond fluctuation model ( bfm ) .",
    "the same fact is true when we compare simulations to experiments ; e.g. , the data of rathgeber et al .",
    "@xcite could be mapped to the bfm  @xcite implying an equivalence between @xmath115 and @xmath116 and between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , for instance .",
    "we also note that with decreasing temperature @xmath119 decreases , irrespective of @xmath2 ( and also @xmath104 decreases ) .",
    "again we remind the reader that this parameterization of our data in terms of effective exponents ( also used in related experimental work  @xcite only can serve to indicate the place in an extended crossover region to which the data belong .    when we analyze the gyration radius of the backbone as a function of backbone chain length for the bs model ( figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) we find that over a restricted range of @xmath0 one can fit the data by effective exponents again , @xmath120 , with @xmath121 , and it is seen that @xmath44 increases systematically with side chain length @xmath2 , and @xmath44 for @xmath51 is larger than for @xmath87 , for the same choice of @xmath2 .",
    "of course , this variation of the effective exponent is just a reflection of a gradual crossover from the rod - like regime ( @xmath122 ) to the self - avoiding walk - like behavior of swollen coils ( @xmath123 , with @xmath124 ) in the good solvent regime @xmath125 or gaussian - like coils ( @xmath126 ) for the theta point ( @xmath87 ) , respectively .",
    "similar plots as in fig .",

    "[ fig9](a)(b ) . due to the availability of equilibrated data for much longer backbone chain lengths",
    "@xmath0 for the bfm , the plot of @xmath127 versus @xmath0 ( fig .  [ fig9](c ) ) indeed shows that the data settle down to a horizontal plateau implying that the asymptotic region where eq .",

    "it is also remarkable that this initial behavior is almost independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; an obvious interpretation is that the stiffening of the backbone caused by the presence of long side chains is effective only on mesoscopic length scales along the backbone , but not on the scale of a few subsequent backbone bonds , which maintain a high local flexibility .",

    "( [ eq16 ] ) for bottle brushes is useful only if the solution is at theta conditions , but not in the good solvent regime . using the data for @xmath44 at @xmath180 from fig .",
    "[ fig8](a)(c ) ( and similar data not shown for @xmath119 ) we hence obtain estimates for the ratios @xmath181 for the various choices of @xmath2 for both @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "in the present paper , a coarse - grained bead - spring model for bottle brush polymers was studied by molecular dynamics methods , varying both the chain length @xmath0 of the backbone and of the side chains ( @xmath2 ) , for two values of the grafting density , under variable solvent conditions .",
    "the main emphasis of the present work was a study of the various characteristic lengths describing the conformation of the macromolecule , contrasting the behavior under theta conditions with the behavior in the good solvent regime .",
    "also a comparison with corresponding results for the bond fluctuation model has been performed ; this athermal model represents very good solvent conditions , and while for corresponding parameters it yields results that are rather similar to the results for the bead spring model in the good solvent regime , it has the advantage that much larger values of @xmath0 can be studied .",
    "among the quantities that have been studied are the end - to - end distances of side chains and of the backbone , as well as the respective gyration radii , but also mesoscopic lengths that are particularly popular when a description in terms of the kratky - porod wormlike chain model is attempted , namely `` the '' persistence length and `` the '' contour length of the wormlike chain .",
    "we have shown that for the range of rather short side chain lengths @xmath2 that is only accessible , either in simulation or experiment , one often finds that a description in terms of power laws with effective exponents is adequate .",
    "specifically , the side chain radii vary as @xmath207 , and @xmath208 ( at the theta temperature @xmath209 ) or @xmath210 to @xmath211 ( in the good solvent regime ) , see fig .",
    "these effective exponents ( for the present models with flexible backbones ) are the same as for otherwise equivalent models with stiff backbones , and also are practically independent of the backbone chain length . while the resulting effective exponents are systematically smaller than the asymptotic values predicted theoretically for the limit @xmath45 , @xmath212 ( good solvents ) or @xmath213 ( theta solvents ) , respectively , they are comparable to the results of pertinent experiments : zhang et al .",
    "@xcite report @xmath214 for a bottle brush where the chemical nature of the main chain and the side chains is identical . for other systems exponents in the range @xmath215",
    "are reported  @xcite , again values comparable to our findings",
    ". some experimental studies also report that somewhat different results occur when different solvents are used  @xcite , but a systematic variation of solvent quality to our knowledge has not yet been performed .",
    "our results have shown that for @xmath216 the side chain radii vary only very weakly with temperature ( which in our model causes the change in solvent quality ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    also the backbone end - to - end distance shows a power law variation with the side chain length , @xmath217 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] - [ fig7 ] ) , reflecting thus the systematic backbone stiffening with increasing side chain length . in this case , however , the effective exponent depends on the backbone chain length @xmath0 , for @xmath218 , before a saturation at @xmath219 ( @xmath35 ) or @xmath220 ( @xmath34 ) occurs , in the case of the bond fluctuation model .",
    "even somewhat larger exponents are observed for the bead - spring model ( up to @xmath221 , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "a further effective exponent describes the variation of the backbone end - to - end distance and gyration radius with backbone chain length ( figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "we have interpreted this variation as a crossover from rod - like behavior at small @xmath0 to self - avoiding walk - like behavior ( under good solvent conditions ) or random walk - like behavior ( under theta conditions ) with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "finally , `` the '' persistence length has been estimated in various ways , and demonstrating that the different estimates are not mutually consistent with each other it was argued that a unique persistence length does not exist . while a regime of exponential decay of the bond autocorrelation function often can be observed over some intermediate range of contour distances ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , [ fig11 ] ) , the resulting estimates for a persistence length do not only depend on side chain length @xmath2 and grafting density @xmath1 , but also on backbone chain length @xmath0 and on temperature @xmath164 ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) . however , when one studies the variation of the end - to - end distance of the backbone for @xmath209 an analysis in terms of the kratky - porod wormlike chain model \\{eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) } becomes feasible ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) .",
    "but one must not identify the contour length @xmath184 implied by this model with the `` chemical '' contour length @xmath222 , where @xmath85 is the actual bond length , but rather one has @xmath193 with @xmath201 distinctly smaller than @xmath85 .",
    "this effect results from the flexibility of the backbone on small scales ; only on the scale of several backbone bonds does the stiffening due to the mutual side chain repulsions come into play .",
    "thus , at the theta point both an effective contour length @xmath184 and a persistence length @xmath223 are well - defined quantities , in terms of a fit of the data to the kratky - porod model , while under good solvent conditions such an analysis is not appropriate .",
    "we hope that the present work stimulates some more systematic experimental work on these issues . of course , for real bottle brushes where the chemical nature of the backbone often differs from the side chains , the interesting possibility arises that the backbone and the side chains have rather different theta temperatures .",
    "another subtle issue concerns the precise location of theta conditions .",
    "while we expect that for the limit @xmath143 at fixed ratio @xmath224 the theta conditions coincide with the theta conditions for simple linear polymers ( @xmath143 , @xmath225 ) , it is not clear whether the location of the theta point for the limit @xmath143 at fixed ( small ) @xmath2 depends significantly on @xmath2 . thus , also more theoretical",

    "<S> we show that even at the theta point the side chains are considerably stretched , their linear dimension depending on the solvent quality only weakly . </S>",
    "<S> effective persistence lengths are extracted both from the orientational correlations and from the backbone end - to - end distance ; it is shown that different measures of the persistence length ( which would all agree for gaussian chains ) are not mutually consistent with each other , and depend distinctly both on @xmath0 and the solvent quality . </S>",
