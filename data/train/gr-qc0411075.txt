    "a fundamental problem in mathematical relativity is to resolve the so - called _ weak cosmic censorship conjecture _ , the statement that for `` reasonable '' einstein - matter systems , generic asymptotically flat data do not lead to singularities visible from infinity .",
    "the notion of `` reasonable '' above is of course not a precise one , and depends very much on the context one has in mind .",
    "a natural matter source for models is provided by kinetic theory .",
    "the simplest example is then a self - gravitating collisionless gas .",
    "the study of the equations describing such a gas , the einstein - vlasov system , was initiated by choquet - bruhat in  @xcite , where the existence of a unique maximal development was proven for the cauchy problem .",
    "the problem of weak cosmic censorship concerns the global behaviour of the maximal development for asymptotically flat initial data .",
    "given the current state of the art in nonlinear evolution equations , symmetry must be imposed on initial data for there to be any hope of making progress .",
    "the global study of the initial value problem for the einstein - vlasov equations for spherically symmetric asymptotically flat initial data was begun in  @xcite , where , in particular , it was proven that for sufficiently small initial data , the maximal development was future causally geodesically complete . the analysis took place in so - called schwarzschild coordinates . in  @xcite ,",
    "an extension principle was proven , again in these coordinates , saying in particular that if the solution stopped existing after finite coordinate time @xmath0 , there was necessarily a singularity at the center .",
    "these results were meant to provide a first step for a _ global _ existence theorem in schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "if this coordinate system could then be shown to cover the domain of outer communications , and if null infinity could moreover be shown to be complete , this would then imply a proof of weak cosmic censorship for this system .",
    "there is another approach to the problem of weak cosmic censorship , due to christodoulou  @xcite , for the problem of a self - gravitating spherically symmetric scalar field .",
    "christodoulou showed that initial data leading to a naked singularity was codimension @xmath1 in the space of all initial data .",
    "this was shown by embedding such exceptional data in a one - dimensional subset of the space of initial data , such that all other initial data in this subset evolved to a spacetime with the following property , which can be expressed in the language of causal sets @xcite . given a terminal indecomposable past ( tip ) with compact intersection with the cauchy surface , then the domain of dependence of any open set containing this intersection contains a trapped surface .",
    "the statement that this latter property is true for generic initial data can be termed the _ trapped surface conjecture_. from this property , the completeness of null infinity was then inferred , proving weak cosmic censorship .",
    "it turns out that the relation between the existence of trapped surfaces and the completeness of null infinity is quite general .",
    "specifically , in  @xcite , it was proven that a weaker version of the trapped surface conjecture is sufficient to prove weak cosmic censorship for a wide variety of matter in spherical symmetry .",
    "in particular , the completeness of null infinity follows from the existence of a _ single _ trapped or marginally trapped surface in the maximal development .",
    "the only really restrictive hypothesis on the matter is that `` first '' singularities necessarily emanate from the center . here ,",
    "the notion of `` first '' is tied to the causal structure and can be formulated in terms of tips .",
    "the goal of this paper is to prove that the above mentioned hypothesis of  @xcite is indeed satisfied by the einstein - vlasov system .",
    "as noted before , extension principles similar in spirit to this one have been proven before ( cf .",
    "these earlier results , however , concern the portion of the development of the einstein - vlasov system covered by particular coordinate systems .",
    "thus , these previous results , as far as they concern the maximal development itself , are weaker than the results presented here , and in particular , are not sufficient to deduce the assumptions of  @xcite .",
    "finally , we make the following remark : in view of  @xcite , there do exist spherically symmetric asymptotically flat initial data for the einstein - vlasov system possessing a trapped surface .",
    "thus , the results of this paper provide in particular the first proof of the existence of solutions for collisionless matter representing the formation of a black hole .",
    "initial data in this paper are always given as follows :    1 .",
    "we have a @xmath2 riemannian manifold @xmath3 , together with an additional symmetric @xmath4-tensor @xmath5 , such that there do not exist closed antitrapped surfaces in the data , and a compactly supported function @xmath6 defined on the tangent bundle of @xmath7 , such that these satisfy @xmath8 here the metric @xmath9 is used to move indices and to define the trace and covariant derivative .",
    "@xmath10 is the scalar curvature of @xmath9 and @xmath11 the square root of its determinant .",
    "2 .   a smooth @xmath12 action on @xmath7 such that @xmath13 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are preserved , and such that @xmath14 inherits naturally the structure of a @xmath1-dimensional manifold .    here and throughout this paper physical units are chosen so that the gravitational constant has the numerical value unity .",
    "we recall the definition of a closed antitrapped surface .",
    "let @xmath15 be a surface in @xmath7 which is closed , i.e. compact without boundary .",
    "suppose that there is a preferred choice @xmath16 of an outward normal to this surface and let @xmath17 be the second fundamental form of @xmath15 in @xmath7 corresponding to the outward normal .",
    "then @xmath15 is said to be antitrapped if @xmath18 .",
    "the theorem of choquet - bruhat  @xcite , applied to the data considered here , together with a standard argument on preservation of symmetry , yields    there exists a unique @xmath2 collection @xmath19 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfy the einstein - vlasov equations 2 .",
    "( @xmath22 , @xmath20 ) is globally hyperbolic , 3 .",
    "@xmath23 induces the initial data @xmath24 and @xmath7 is a cauchy surface 4 .",
    "any other collection @xmath25 with these properties 1 - 3 can be embedded in the given one .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 acts smoothly by isometry on @xmath22 and preserves @xmath21 , and @xmath26 inherits the structure of a time - oriented @xmath4-dimensional lorentzian manifold , with timelike boundary @xmath27 , the center .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the natural projection .",
    "on @xmath29 we can define the so - called area - radius function @xmath30 we have @xmath31 iff @xmath32 . we can always choose global future directed null coordinates on @xmath29 , i.e.  such that the metric takes the from @xmath33 .",
    "the metric of @xmath22 then takes the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the standard metric on @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , are local coordinates on @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be chosen so that @xmath41 points `` inwards '' and @xmath42 `` outwards '' .",
    "such definitions are meaningful in view of the assumption of asymptotic flatness .",
    "we define @xmath43 @xmath44 the assumption of no antitrapped surfaces initially means by definition that @xmath45 holds on the initial hypersurface .",
    "it follows that it holds throughout @xmath29 as a consequence of the einstein equations and the dominant energy condition @xcite .",
    "we shall call the region where @xmath46 , the _ regular region _ , and denote it @xmath47 .",
    "we call the region where @xmath48 the _ marginally trapped region _ , and denote it by @xmath49 , and finally , we shall can the region where @xmath50 the _ trapped region _ , and denote it by @xmath51 .",
    "the extension principle proven in this paper will apply to a region @xmath52 with penrose diagram : @xmath53 ( i.e.  a subset @xmath54\\times[v_1,v_2]\\setminus ( u_2,v_2)$ ] ) such that @xmath55 let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be the parts of the boundary of @xmath58 defined by @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "one can think of @xmath58 as the `` top '' of a non - trapped non - central indecomposable past ( ip ) corresponding to a candidate `` first '' singularity . in this language , the result of this paper is that such an ip can not be a tip , i.e.    [ extension ] if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 for a @xmath63 .",
    "the theorem thus says that there is no singularity of this form after all !    as one might expect , the proof of theorem  [ extension ] proceeds by obtaining _ a priori _ estimates in @xmath58 and then applying an appropriate local existence result .",
    "the _ a priori _ estimates make use of a certain energy flux along null hypersurfaces .",
    "this fact , together with the fact that regular null coordinates can always be chosen , makes it natural to stick to these .",
    "we give the form of the equations in local null coordinates in the next two sections .",
    "then , in section  [ locsec ] , we formulate a local existence theorem ( proposition  [ local ] ) for a double characteristic initial value problem .",
    "the `` time '' of existence , in the sense of null coordinates , will depend only on the @xmath64 norm of the metric and the @xmath65 norm ( and the support ) of @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain energy estimates in section  [ enestsec ] , and use these , together with the structure of the vlasov equation , to derive in sections  [ c1sec][c2sec ] _ a priori _ estimates for the norm of proposition  [ local ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ extension ] will follow immediately in section  [ theproof ]",
    ". finally , in section  [ appli ] , we state two applications of our results , discussed already in the introduction .",
    "the above theorem depends on having a well - behaved matter model and the analogous result must be expected to fail for dust .",
    "this is illustrated by the penrose diagram fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "the reader should consult @xcite for general facts about the initial value problem in spherical symmetry .",
    "when specialized to this case , the einstein equations are : @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 the former two equations can be viewed as wave equations for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while the latter two equations can be viewed as constraint equations on null hypersurfaces . a specific choice of matter model , such as a collisionless gas , leads to expressions for the components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "to describe the vlasov equation in local coordinates , we need a coordinate system on @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denote the functions on @xmath72 , defined by writing an arbitrary @xmath76 as @xmath77 together with the pull - back of the coordinates on spacetime these functions define a local coordinate system on @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath78 be defined by @xmath79 where @xmath80 ranges over future - pointing vectors .",
    "we call @xmath81 the mass shell .",
    "it follows that @xmath82 we use @xmath73 , @xmath75 and the pull - back of the coordinates on spacetime to define coordinates on @xmath81 and @xmath74 is regarded as a function of these coordinates defined by the relation ( [ massshell ] ) .",
    "the vlasov equation is an equation for a non - negative function @xmath83 which , in the case that @xmath21 is spherically symmetric , is given by @xmath84 in deriving this we have used the expressions for the christoffel symbols given in appendix a and the fact that a spherically symmetric function @xmath21 on the mass shell is a function of the variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath73 , and @xmath85 .",
    "this implies the identity @xmath86 which has been used to simplify the vlasov equation .",
    "note that both the expressions @xmath87 and @xmath88 have a meaning independent of the particular choice of coordinates @xmath37 on @xmath36 .",
    "finally , to close the system , we must define the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we first note that for any point @xmath89 , it follows that @xmath90 , as a spacelike hypersurface in @xmath91 , inherits a volume form from the lorentzian metric . in local",
    "coordinates this volume form can be written @xmath92 or alternatively @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the square root of the determinant of @xmath95 .",
    "we then have @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "it follows immediately that this matter model satisfies the energy conditions : @xmath98",
    "to prove our extension theorem , we will certainly need to appeal to some sort of local existence theorem . in particular",
    ", it is the norm in this theorem that will tell us what quantities we must bound _ a priori _ in @xmath58 . in principle , one could try to prove estimates so as to apply the local existence result of  @xcite . for various reasons ,",
    "however , the following local existence theorem for a characteristic initial value problem will be more convenient :    [ local ] let @xmath99 .",
    "let @xmath100 be positive @xmath101-functions defined on @xmath102\\times \\{0\\}\\cup \\{0\\}\\times[0,d]$ ] , and let @xmath21 be a non - negative @xmath103 function defined on the part of the mass shell over @xmath102\\times\\{0\\}\\cup\\{0\\}\\times[0,d]$ ] .",

    "the compatibility conditions referred to in the statement of the proposition are as follows .",

    "all derivatives of @xmath21 tangential to this manifold can be calculated by direct differentiation . by using the field equations transverse derivatives ( and thus all derivatives ) of @xmath21",
    "can be computed up to order @xmath125 . in a similar way ,",
    "all derivatives up to order @xmath125 can be computed on @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "the condition that derivatives determined in these two different ways agree at @xmath110 is what is referred to above as the @xmath101 compatibility condition .",
    "let us add the remark that , defining @xmath20 on @xmath22 by ( [ metric ] ) , the above gives rise to a solution of the einstein - vlasov equations upstairs , with the obvious relation to characteristic data , interpreted upstairs .",
    "a fundamental fact about the analysis of spherically symmetric einstein matter systems in the non - trapped region is the existence of energy estimates .    to describe these ,",
    "let us first settle for a particular null - coordinate description of the set @xmath58 .",
    "we normalize our @xmath39-coordinate such that @xmath127 along @xmath56 .",
