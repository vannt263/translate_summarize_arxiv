    "a quantum communication network based on the distribution and sharing of entangled states is potentially secure to eavesdropping and is therefore of great practical interest @xcite .  a protocol for the realization of such a long distance system , known as the quantum repeater ,",
    "was proposed by briegel",
    "_ et al_. @xcite .  a quantum repeater based on the use of atomic ensembles as memory elements , distributed over the network ,",
    "was subsequently suggested by duan , lukin , cirac and zoller @xcite .",
    "the storage of information in the atomic ensembles involves the raman scattering of an incident light beam from ground state atoms with the emission of a signal photon .",
    "the photon is correlated with the creation of a phased , ground - state , coherent excitation of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the information may be retrieved by a reverse raman scattering process , sending the excitation back to the initial atomic ground state and generating an idler photon directionally correlated with the signal photon @xcite .  in the alkali gases , the signal and the idler field wavelengths are in the near - infrared spectral region .",
    "this presents a wavelength mismatch with telecommunication wavelength optical fiber , which has a transmission window at longer wavelengths  ( 1.1 - 1.6 um ) .",
    "it is this mismatch that motivates the search for alternative processes that can generate telecom wavelength photons correlated with atomic spin waves @xcite .",
    "this motivates the research presented in this article where we study multi - level atomic schemes in which the transition between the excited states is resonant with a telecom wavelength light field @xcite .",
    "the basic problem is to harness the absorption and the emission of telecom photons while preserving quantum correlations between the atoms , which store information and the photons that carry along the optical fiber channel of the network .",
    "it is not common to have a telecom ground state transition in atomic gases except for rare earth elements @xcite or in an erbium - doped crystal @xcite .",
    "however , a telecom wavelength ( signal ) can be generated from transitions between excited levels in the alkali metals @xcite .",
    "the ladder configuration of atomic levels provides a source for telecom photons ( signal ) from the upper atomic transition .  for rubidium and cesium atoms , the signal field has the range around 1.3 - 1.5 @xmath0 m that can be coupled to an optical fiber and transmitted to a remote location .",
    "cascade emission may result in pairs of photons , the signal entangled with the subsequently emitted infrared photon ( idler ) from the lower atomic transition .",
    "entangled signal and idler photons were generated from a phase - matched four - wave mixing configuration in a cold , optically thick @xmath1rb ensemble @xcite .",
    "this correlated two - photon source is potentially useful as the signal field has telecom wavelength .",
    "the temporal emission characteristics of the idler field , generated on the lower arm of the cascade transition , were observed in measurements of the joint signal - idler correlation function .",
    "the idler decay time was shorter than the natural atomic decay time and dependent on optical thickness in a way reminiscent of superradiance @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous emission from an optically dense atomic ensemble is a many - body problem due to the radiative coupling between atoms .",
    "this coupling is responsible for the phenomenon of superradiance firstly discussed by dicke @xcite in 1954 .",
    "since then , this collective emission has been extensively studied in two atom systems indicating a dipole - dipole interaction @xcite , in the totally inverted n atom systems @xcite , and in the extended atomic ensemble @xcite .",
    "the emission intensity has been investigated using the master equation approach @xcite and with maxwell - bloch equations @xcite .",
    "a useful summary and review of superradiance can be found in the reference @xcite .",
    "recent approaches to superradiance include the quantum trajectory method @xcite and the quantum correction method @xcite .     in the limit of single atomic excitation ,",
    "superradiant emission characteristics have been discussed in the reference @xcite and @xcite .  for a singly excited system , the basis set reduces to n rather than @xmath2 states .",
    "radiative phenomena have been investigated using dynamical methods @xcite and by the numerical solution of an eigenvalue problem @xcite .",
    "a collective frequency shift @xcite can be significant at a high atomic density @xcite and has been observed recently in an experiment where atoms are resonant with a planar cavity @xcite .    to account for multiple atomic excitations in the signal - idler emission from a cascade atomic ensemble ,",
    "the schrdinger s equation approach becomes cumbersome .",
    "an alternative theory of c - number langevin equations is suitable for solution by stochastic simulations .",
    "langevin equations were initially derived to describe brownian motion @xcite .",
    "a fluctuating force is used to represent the random impacts of the environment on the brownian particle .",
    "a given realization of the langevin equation involves a trajectory perturbed by the random force .",
    "ensemble averaging such trajectories provides a natural and direct way to investigate the dynamics of the stochastic variables .",
    "an essential element in the stochastic simulations is a proper characterization of the langevin noises .",
    "these represent the quantum fluctuations responsible for the initiation of the spontaneous emission from the inverted @xcite , or pumped atomic system @xcite as in our case .",
    "the positive - p phase space method @xcite is employed to derive the fokker - planck equations that lead directly to the c - number langevin equations .",
    "the classical noise correlation functions , equivalently diffusion coefficients , are alternatively  confirmed by use of the einstein relations @xcite .",
    "the c - number langevin equations correspond to ito - type stochastic differential equations that may be simulated numerically .",
    "the noise correlations can be represented either by using a square @xcite or a non - square `` square root '' diffusion matrix @xcite .",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we show the formalism of positive p - representation , and demonstrate the stochastic differential equations of cascade emission ( signal and idler ) from an atomic ensemble . in section iii",
    "we solve numerically for the dynamics of the atoms and counter - propagating signal and idler fields in a positive p - representation .",
    "we present results of signal and idler field intensities , and the signal - idler second order correlation function for different optical depths of the atomic ensemble .",
    "section iv presents our discussions and conclusions . in the appendix",
    ", we show the details in the derivations of c - number langevin equations that are the foundation for numerical approaches of the cascade emission .  in appendix",
    "a , we formulate the hamiltonian , and derive the fokker - planck equations by characteristic functions @xcite in positive p - representation .",
    "then corresponding c - number langevin equations are derived , and the noise correlations are found from the diffusion coefficients in fokker - planck equations as shown in appendix b.",
    "the phase space methods @xcite that mainly include p- , q- , and wigner ( w ) representations are techniques of using classical analogues to study quantum systems , especially harmonic oscillators .",
    "the eigenstate of harmonic oscillator is a coherent state that provides the basis expansion to construct various representations .",
    "p and q - representation are associated respectively with evaluations of normal and anti - normal order correlations of creation and destruction operators .",
    "w - representation is invented for the purpose of describing symmetrically ordered creation and destruction operators .  since p - representation describes normally ordered quantities that are relevant in experiments , we are interested in investigating one class of generalized p - representations , the positive p - representation that has semi - definite property in the diffusion process , which is important in describing quantum noise systems .",
    "positive - p representation @xcite is an extension to glauber - sudarshan p - representation that uses coherent state ( @xmath3 ) as a basis expansion of density operator @xmath4 .  in terms of diagonal coherent states with a quasi - probability distribution ,",
    "@xmath5 , a density operator in p - representation is @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the integration domain .",
    "the normalization condition of @xmath8 which is tr\\{@xmath4}@xmath9 indicates the normalization for @xmath10 as well , @xmath11 .",

    "when a large number of atoms is considered , which is indeed the case of the actual laser , a macroscopic variable can be defined .",
    "then a generalized fokker - planck equation can be derived from characteristic functions by neglecting higher order terms that are proportional to the inverse of number of atoms .",
    "it is similar to our case when we solve light - matter interactions in an atomic ensemble that the large number cuts off the higher order terms in characteristic functions .",
    "we consider @xmath23 cold atoms that are initially prepared in the ground state interacting with four independent electromagnetic fields .  as shown in fig.[four ] , two driving lasers ( of rabi frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) excite a ladder configuration @xmath26 and idler @xmath27 are generated spontaneously .",
    "we note that the spontaneous emission from the cascade driving scheme is a stochastic process due to the quantum fluctuations , unlike the diamond configuration where quantum noise can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the complete derivation of the c - number langevin equations for cascade emission from the four - level atomic ensemble is described in appendix a and b.  after setting up the hamiltonian , we follow the standard procedure to construct the characteristic functions @xcite in appendix a using the positive - p representation @xcite .  in appendix",
    "b.1 , the fokker - planck equation is found by directly fourier transforming the characteristic functions , and making a @xmath28 expansion .",
    "finally the ito stochastic differential equations are written down from inspection of the first - order derivative ( drift term ) and second - order derivative ( diffusion term ) in the fokker - planck equation .",
    "the equations are then written in dimensionless form by introducing the arecchi - courtens cooperation units @xcite in appendix b.2 .  from eq .",
    "( [ bloch2 ] ) and the field equations that follow , these c - number langevin equations in a co - moving frame are ,    @xmath29    @xmath30    where ( i ) stands for ito type sde .",

    "the remaining equations of motion , which close the set , can be found by replacing the above classical variables , @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "note that the atomic populations satisfy @xmath41  the superscripts , dagger ( @xmath42 ) for atomic variables and ( @xmath43 ) for field variables , denote the independent variables , which is a feature of the positive - p representation : there are double dimension spaces for each variable .",
    "these variables are complex conjugate to each other when ensemble averages are taken , for example @xmath44 and @xmath45  the doubled spaces allow the variables to explore trajectories outside the classical phase space .    before going further to discuss the numerical solution of the sde",
    ", we point out that the diffusion matrix elements have been computed using fokker - planck equations and by the einstein relations discussed in appendix b.2 .",
    "this provides the important check on the lengthy derivations of the diffusion matrix elements we need for the simulations .",
    "the next step is to find expressions for the langevin noises in terms of a non - square matrix @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath46 is used to construct the symmetric diffusion matrix @xmath47 for a ito sde , @xmath48 where @xmath49 ( wiener process ) and @xmath50  note that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an orthogonal matrix ( @xmath53 ) , leaves @xmath7  unchanged , so @xmath46 is not unique .",
    "we could also construct a square matrix representation @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this involves a procedure of matrix decomposition into a product of lower and upper triangular matrix factors .",
    "a cholesky decomposition can be used to determine the @xmath46 matrix elements successively row by row .",
    "the downside of this procedure is that the @xmath46 matrix elements must be differentiated in converting the ito sde to its equivalent stratonovich form for numerical solution .",
    "the stratonovich sde is necessary for the stability and the convergence of semi - implicit methods .  because of the analytic difficulties in transforming to the stratonovich form , we use instead the non - square form of @xmath46 @xcite .     in this case",
    "a typical @xmath46 matrix element is a sum of terms , each one of which is a product of the square root of a diffusion matrix element with a unit strength real ( if the diffusion matrix element is diagonal ) or complex ( if the diffusion matrix element is off - diagonal ) gaussian unit white noise .",
    "it is straightforward to check that a @xmath46 matrix constructed in this way reproduces the required diffusion matrix @xmath54 .",
    "as pointed out in the reference @xcite , the transverse dipole - dipole interaction can be neglected and nonparaxial spontaneous decay rate can be accounted for by a single atom decay rate if the atomic density is not too high .",
    "we are interested here in conditions where the ensemble length @xmath55 is significant and propagation effects are non - negligible , and the average distance between atoms @xmath56{v / n}$ ] is larger than the transition wavelength @xmath57  the length scales satisfy @xmath58 and we consider a pencil - like cylindrical atomic ensemble .",
    "the paraxial or one - dimensional assumption for field propagation is then valid , and the transverse dipole - dipole interaction is not important for the atomic density we focus here .",
    "the theory of cascade emission presented here provides the solid ground for simulations of fluctuations that initiate the radiation process in the atomic ensemble . a proper way of treating fluctuations or noise correlations and formulating sde requires an ito form that is derived from the fokker - planck equation . an alternative but more straightforward approach by making quantum to classical correspondence in the quantum langevin equation does not guarantee an ito type sde .",
    "that is the reason we take the route of fokker - planck equation , and the coupled equations of eq.([bloch3 ] ) are the main results in this section .",
    "there are several possible ways to integrate the differential equation numerically",
    ".  three main categories of algorithm used are forward ( explicit ) , backward ( implicit ) , and mid - point ( semi - implicit ) methods @xcite . the forward difference method , which euler or runge - kutta methods utilizes , is not guaranteed to  converge in stochastic integrations @xcite .  there",
    "it is shown that the semi - implicit method @xcite is more robust in stratonovich type sde simulations @xcite .",
    "more extensive studies of the stability and convergence of sde can be found in the reference @xcite .",
    "the stratonovich type sde equivalent to the ito type equation ( [ ito ] ) , is@xmath59dt\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum\\limits_{j}b_{ij}(t,\\overrightarrow{x_{t}})dw_{t}^{j}\\text { \\ ( stratonovich),}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has the same diffusion terms @xmath60 but with modified drift terms .",
    "this `` correction '' term arises from the different definitions of stochastic integral in the ito and stratonovich calculus .    at the end of appendix c.3",
    ", we derive the `` correction '' terms noted above .",
    "we then have 19 classical variables including atomic populations , coherences , and two counter - propagating cascade fields .  with 64 diffusion matrix elements and an associated 117 random numbers required to represent the instantaneous langevin noises , we are ready to solve the equations numerically using the robust midpoint difference method .",
    "the problem we encounter here involves counter - propagating field equations in the space dimension and initial value type atomic equations in the time dimension .",
    "the counter - propagating field equations have a boundary condition specified at each end of the medium .",
    "this is a two - point boundary value problem , and a numerical approach to its solution , the shooting method @xcite , is used here .",
