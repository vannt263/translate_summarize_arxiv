    "in our current understanding of pulsar magnetospheres and radiation mechanisms , strongly magnetized rotating neutron stars play a central role .",
    "the underlying plasma processes like particle acceleration , pair creation and pulsed emission profiles throughout the whole electromagnetic spectrum strongly depend on the peculiar magnetic field geometry and strength adopted or extracted from numerical simulations of the magnetosphere .",
    "for instance radio emission is believed to emanate from the polar caps , therefore in regions of strong gravity where curvature and frame - dragging effects are considerable due to the high compacity of neutron stars @xmath4 for typical models with its mass  @xmath5 , its radius  @xmath6 and the schwarzschild radius given by @xmath1 , @xmath7 being the gravitational constant and @xmath8 the speed of light .",
    "detailed quantitative analysis of radio pulse polarization and pair cascade dynamics could greatly benefit from a better quantitative description of the electromagnetic field around the polar caps .",
    "although there exists an extensive literature about flat space - time electrodynamics , only little work has been done to include general - relativistic effects .",
    "the first general solution for an oblique rotator in flat vacuum space - time was found by  @xcite with closed analytical formulas .",
    "this solution is often quoted to explain the magnetic dipole radiation losses . to be truly exact , we emphasize that the poynting flux  @xmath9 derived from his solution does not strictly coincide with the point dipole losses  @xmath10 but depends on the ratio  @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the light cylinder radius and @xmath3 the rotation rate of the neutron star .",
    "it is only equal to the textbook equation for dipole losses in the limit of vanishing radius @xmath13 .",
    "the distinction is meaningful at least for checking results emanating from numerical computations . indeed , because of limited computer resources , we are often forced to take ratios  @xmath14 not completely negligible compared to unity .",
    "therefore the computed spin - down luminosity can significantly deviate from the point dipole losses .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed in the case of an aligned rotator that the electric field induced by frame - dragging effects could be as high as the one induced by the stellar rotation itself .",
    "these results were extended to an oblique rotator a few years later by   thanks to a formalism developed earlier by  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial to treat maxwell equations in the general - relativistic framework in order to analyse quantitatively acceleration and radiation in the vicinity of the neutron star .",
    "this led  @xcite to seek for an approximate solution of maxwell equations in a curved space - time either described by the schwarzschild metric or by the kerr metric , using a linearised approach employing the newman - penrose formalism .",
    "he computed the structure of the electromagnetic waves propagating in vacuum and launched by a rotating dipole .",
    "he also gave an expression for the poynting flux  @xmath15 depending on the ratio  @xmath11 .",
    "the exact analytical solution for the static magnetic dipole in schwarzschild space - time was given by @xcite and extended to multipoles by .",
    "@xcite also studied the influence of space - time curvature and frame dragging effects on the electric field around the polar caps of a pulsar and confirmed the earlier claims of an increase in its strength . @xcite",
    "computed the electric field for an aligned rotator in vacuum in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the aligned rotator has also been investigated by @xcite with special emphasize to particle acceleration in vacuum . @xcite and @xcite took a similar approach to study the acceleration of particles around polar caps . @xcite computed the electromagnetic field in the exterior of a slowly rotating neutron star in the slow rotation metric as well as inside the star and investigated the impact of oscillations .",
    "they gave approximate analytical expressions for the external electromagnetic field close to the neutron star .",
    "@xcite extended the previous work by solving numerically the equations for the oblique rotator in vacuum in general relativity .",
    "they retrieve @xcite results close to the surface and the deutsch solution for distances larger than the light cylinder  @xmath16 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to elucidate quantitatively and accurately some aspects of general - relativistic effects on the electrodynamics close to the neutron star .",
    "our goal is to derive a general formalism to compute the solution of maxwell equations in curved space - time for any multipole component of the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , we use a 3 + 1 formalism of electrodynamics in curved space - time as presented in   [ sec : modele ] .",
    "next we show how to solve for the electromagnetic field for an aligned rotator in   [ sec : aligne ] .",
    "this method is easily extended to a perpendicular rotator as explained in   [ sec : orthogonal ] .",
    "because maxwell equations in vacuum are linear , the most general solution for an oblique rotator will be a linear superposition of the weighted aligned and perpendicular rotator .",
    "conclusions and future possible work are drawn in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the covariant form to describe the gravitational and electromagnetic field in general relativity is the natural way to write them down in a frame independent way . nevertheless , it is more intuitive to split space - time into an absolute space and a universal time , similar to our all day three dimensional space , rather than to use the full four dimensional formalism .",
    "another important advantage of a 3 + 1 split is a straightforward transcription of flat space techniques for scalar , vector and tensor fields to curved spaces .",
    "we start with a description of the special foliation used for the metric .",
    "next we derive maxwell equations in this foliation and conclude on some words about force - free electrodynamics which will be treated in another work but for completeness we give the useful expressions already in this paper .",
    "we therefore split the four dimensional space - time into a 3 + 1  foliation such that the metric  @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the time coordinate or universal time and @xmath21 some associated space coordinates .",

    "the three dimensional vector fields are not independent , they are related by two important constitutive relations , namely    [ eq : constitutive ] @xmath68    the curvature of absolute space is taken into account by the lapse function factor  @xmath23 in the first term on the right - hand side and the frame dragging effect is included in the second term , the cross - product between the shift vector  @xmath69 and the fields .",
    "we see that @xmath70 are the fundamental fields , actually those measured by a fido , see below .",
    "the source terms have not yet been specified .",
    "having in mind to apply the above equations to the pulsar magnetosphere , we give the expressions for the current in the limit of a force - free plasma , neglecting inertia and pressure .",
    "the force - free condition in covariant form reads @xmath71 and in the 3 + 1  formalism it becomes    @xmath72    which implies @xmath73 and therefore also @xmath74 . as in the special relativistic case ,",
