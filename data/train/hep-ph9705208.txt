    "the origin of @xmath0 violation is still a mystery in particle physics . unlike in the quark sector",
    "even the very existence of @xmath0 violation is not known in the lepton sector .",
    "recent advances in neutrino observations mainly of astrophysical origins strongly suggest the existence of tiny neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "if this is the case nature would admit the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite type flavor mixing also in the lepton sector which allows us to have @xmath0 violating phases with three ( or more ) generation of leptons .",
    "if revealed , it should give us important insight into our understanding of fundamental structure of matter .",
    "moreover , there is an intriguing suggestion @xcite that @xmath0 violation in the lepton sector might be an indispensable ingredient in producing the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "it has been known since long time ago @xcite that the effect of @xmath0 violating phase can in principle be observable in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the other earlier references include @xcite .",
    "as we will recapitulate below the particle - antiparticle difference between the oscillation probabilities , @xmath3 , in vacuum is characterized @xcite by the leptonic analogue of the jarlskog factor , the unique and phase - convention independent measure for @xmath0 violation @xcite .",
    "recently , measuring leptonic @xmath0 violation in the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite received considerable amount of attention in the literature @xcite .",
    "the potential obstacle in measuring @xmath0 violation in the long - baseline experiment is the matter effect in the earth .",
    "it is well known that the matter effect acts differently in propagation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in matter ; it gives rise to the index of refraction which differs in sign between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath6 difference @xmath7 of the oscillation probabilities is inevitably contaminated by the matter effect @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is known by numerical computation that the matter effect is overwhelming over the genuine @xmath0 violating effect at certain values of the mixing parameters in the @xmath2 channel @xcite .",
    "but it appears to the authors that we still lack understanding of the over - all features of the relationship between the @xmath0 violations due to the matter and to the @xmath0 violating phases .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to illuminate global structure of the interplay between the matter and the genuine @xmath0 violating effects in long - baseline experiments . to this goal",
    "we develop a formalism by which we can derive approximate analytic expressions of oscillation probabilities .",
    "these analytic formulas will allow us to have global view of the features of @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "our formalism is based on the adiabatic approximation and takes into account the matter effect in a perturbative way .",
    "it also enjoys further simplification due to the presumed hierarchy of neutrino masses which will be explained below .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers to investigate the same problem in various neutrino mass hierarchies . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , which is observed by the kamiokande , imb , and the soudan 2 experiments @xcite , can be interpreted as the evidence for neutrino oscillations whose relevant mass scale is @xmath8 ev@xmath9 or larger .",
    "( we note , however , that the two experiments do not observe the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite . )",
    "it is a natural assumption because it is the very motivation for planning the long - baseline experiments .",
    "the restriction leads to the hierarchy between the matter potential and the mass differences , which allows us to treat the matter effect perturbatively .",
    "namely , we derive closed - form analytic expressions of the neutrino - antineutrino difference between oscillation probabilities which is generally valid under the adiabatic approximation and a first - order perturbative treatment of the matter effect .    we restrict ourselves into the case of neutrino mass hierarchy motivated by the cosmological hot dark matter @xcite in our analysis of the features of @xmath0 violation in this paper .",
    "the assumption of the dark matter scale mass difference allows us to utilize the strong constraints on the mixing parameters deduced from the terrestrial experiments @xcite .",
    "it is the reason why we decided to investigate this case first ; because of the constraints we are able to estimate the magnitude of cp violation in a less ambiguous way .",
    "we give a few ward on the problem if the mass hierarchy we examine in this paper can account for the other known hints for the neutrino masses .",
    "they include the solar neutrino deficit @xcite and the lsnd experiments @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the solar neutrinos .",
    "it is well known that for this scheme the capability of explaining the gross deficit of the solar neutrino flux depends upon the parameter regions . in the region ( a ) ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : region ] ) for the definitions of these regions ) the global deficit of the flux can be accommodated in a manner of acker and pakvasa @xcite . in the region ( b )",
    "there is no way of having a gross deficit of the solar neutrino flux within the framework of three - flavor mixing .",
    "therefore , we must introduce some other ingredients such as sterile neutrinos to achieve the deficit in the region ( b ) .",
    "the results of the lsnd experiments can be easily accommodated in the present framework .",
    "the lsnd data allow the mass scales which is consistent with hot dark matter .",
    "if smaller values of @xmath10 is preferred for consistency with other experiments it may be necessary to relax the constraints on the mass scale required by the mixed dark matter cosmology @xcite .",
    "if the simultaneous consistency with the solar neutrino and the lsnd data is demanded there is no solution within our present framework .    within the restrictions to the mass hierarchies hinted by the dark matter and the atmospheric neutrinos , we will try to answer the following questions : + ( 1 ) are there any channels which are much less contaminated by the matter effect ?",
    "+ ( 2 ) in which parameter regions do we expect to have maximal @xmath0 violation and how large is its size ?",
    "it is known that the matter effect in the oscillation probability in long - baseline experiments is not very large , at most a few to several @xmath11 .",
    "one might then feel strange that the matter effect is dominant in certain channel .",
    "the point is that what we are dealing with is not the oscillation probability itself but the difference between the neutrino and the antineutrino oscillation probabilities .",
    "the matter effect can give rise to a dominant effect in such @xmath6 difference .",
    "this investigation was motivated by a question asked by a long - baseline neutrino experimentalist @xcite ; `` is the matter effect contamination small in @xmath12 channel ? ''",
    "this is the interesting question for two reasons , one theoretical and one experimental .",
    "experimentally it is a very relevant question because they are planning to do long - baseline neutrino experiments in the appearance channel , @xmath12 .",
    "it is also of interest from the theoretical point of view ; in the conventional treatment of `` optional '' two - flavor mixing favored by experimentalists the @xmath12 channel might be free from the matter effect because there is no @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s in the earth .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 violation is the genuine three - flavor mixing effect which can not occur in two - flavor mixing framework .",
    "therefore , the question still remains whether the matter effect is small in the @xmath12 channel , as correctly raised by the experimentalist .    in sec .",
    "ii , we review some basic facts on @xmath0 violation in vacuum in the context of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we also summarize the mass patterns of neutrinos which we use in our analysis in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii , we set up our formalism based on the adiabatic approximation . in sec .",
    "iv , we develop a framework for perturbative treatment of the matter effect which is applicable to the long - baseline neutrino experiments . in sec .",
    "v , we derive the approximate analytic formulas for the neutrino - antineutrino difference in oscillation probabilities by taking account of the matter effect to first - order in perturbation theory . in sec .",
    "vi , we use our analytic formula to illuminate global features of the competing two effects producing @xmath0 violation , the genuine effect due to @xmath0 violating phase and a fake one due to the matter effect . in sec .",
    "vii , we give the results of our detailed numerical computation of the @xmath0 violation to confirm the qualitative understanding of the structure of the coexisting two effects obtained in sec .",
    "the last section viii is devoted to the conclusion . in appendix",
    "we confirm that the adiabatic approximation is in fact a very good approximation for matter density profiles relevant for the long - baseline experiments .",
    "in this section we first review briefly the @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "we then describe the neutrino mass spectrum which we consider in this paper .",
    "it is intended for convenience for the readers who are not familiar to the subject and precedes the following three sections in which we develop our analytic framework usable for analyses with more general neutrino mass patterns .",
    "we work with the three - flavor mixing scheme of neutrinos and introduce the flavor mixing matrix @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the gauge and the mass eigenstates , respectively .",
    "then in vacuum the direct measure of @xmath0 violation can be written @xcite as @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the mass of @xmath22-th neutrino , @xmath23 the neutrino energy and @xmath24 the distance from the neutrino source .",

    "let us come to the mass hierarchy which will be used in our analysis presented in secs .",
    "vi and vii .",
    "we work with the mass hierarchy @xmath35 where the first is suggested by the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite , and the second is motivated by the hot and the cold dark matter cosmology @xcite .",
    "the kamiokande , imb , and the soudan 2 experiments observed a 30 - 40 % deficit in the double ratio @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "a natural interpretation of the anomaly is due to the neutrino oscillation . in particular",
    ", the multi - gev data from the kamiokande experiments indicates that the double ratio has a zenith - angle dependence which is quite consistent with the interpretation of the anomaly as the evidence for neutrino oscillations with the mass difference @xmath8 ev@xmath9 .",
    "the hot and the cold dark matter cosmology is one of the viable models of the structure formation in the universe @xcite . the hot dark matter is the indispensable ingredient in the scenario by which the magnitude of density fluctuation normalized by cobe data can be made consistent with that of small scales determined by correlations between galaxies and clusters @xcite .",
    "neutrinos of masses 2 - 20 ev are the natural candidate for the hot dark matter .",
    "in fact , it is the only known particles among the candidates for particle dark matter .",
    "the advantage of the dark matter motivated mass hierarchy ( [ eqn : assdark ] ) is that the mixing parameters are subject to the powerful constraints that comes from the reactor and the accelerator experiments @xcite and we can draw a clear answer to the question on how large is the magnitude of @xmath0 violation .    under the assumption ( [ eqn : assdark ] )",
    "the oscillations due to the larger mass squared difference @xmath37 are averaged out in long - baseline experiments and we have , @xmath38 since @xmath39 can be of order unity in long - baseline experiments , the @xmath0 violation @xmath40 can be approximated as @xmath41 .",

    "we notice from fig .",
    "1 that allowed parameters are restricted into three separate regions . @xmath47",
    "the constraints from the reactor and accelerator experiments are so strong that one neutrino flavor almost decouples with the remaining two .",

    "2 we show the neutrino mass spectrum which is realized in the region ( a ) and ( b ) .",

    "the case ( a-1 ) is theoretically appealing because of the seesaw mechanism @xcite and from the observed mass hierarchy among charged leptons .",
    "we discuss the neutrino propagation in the earth matter within the framework of three - flavor mixing of neutrinos .",
    "it is worth to note that when we discuss the long - baseline experiments whose baseline distances less than 1000 km the adiabatic approximation is a very good approximation , as we demonstrate in appendix .",
    "it is because the neutrino beam only passes through thin layer of the continental structure closest to the earth surface in which the matter density is approximately constant , @xmath56 2.72 g/@xmath57 @xcite . by virtue of this fact we can derive a general closed form expression of @xmath7 , the @xmath58 difference in oscillation probabilities .",

    "<S> , we develop a formalism based on the adiabatic approximation and perturbative treatment of the matter effect which allows us to obtain approximate analytic expressions of the oscillation probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we present an order - of - magnitude estimation and a detailed numerical computation of the absolute and the relative magnitudes of the @xmath0 violations under the mass hierarchy suggested by the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the cosmological dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the genuine @xmath0 violating effect is at most @xmath1 1 % , and the matter effect dominates over the intrinsic @xmath0 violation only in a region of parameters where the oscillation probability of @xmath2 is large .    </S>",
