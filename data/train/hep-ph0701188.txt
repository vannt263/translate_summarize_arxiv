    "the detailed suppression pattern , @xmath6 , and elliptic flow , @xmath5 , of high - transverse - momentum hadrons is an important experimental signature of the quark - gluon plasma creation in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "jet quenching for light mesons , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , at rhic is well explained by radiative energy loss calculations  @xcite .",
    "it also gives the dominant contribution to the azimuthal asymmetry of hard probes  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , models  @xcite with a physically reasonable set of qgp temperatures and densities , predict a qcd heavy - quark energy loss which is too small compared to the measured suppression of single non - photonic electrons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is critical to investigate new interaction mechanisms in the qgp that may be specific to heavy flavor  @xcite .",

    "it has been argued that strong coupling between the @xmath3- and @xmath4-quarks and the qgp medium may be generated via quark - resonance interactions near the qcd - phase transition , @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , important to study the interplay between such non - perturbative effects and the radiative  @xcite and collisional  @xcite heavy - quark energy loss .",

    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we note that the generated @xmath11 for @xmath4-quarks is much smaller than that for @xmath3-quarks .",
    "one of the reasons for the large suppression in our current energy - loss implementation is that the einstein fluctuation - dissipation relation induces minimal gaussian fluctuations .",
    "these are significantly different from the ones in the probabilistic treatment of pqcd - energy loss  @xcite .",
    "future langevin simulations of @xmath3- and @xmath4-quark diffusion should include momentum fluctuations beyond the einstein s relation and the decay of the heavy quark / hadron spectra into @xmath20 for direct comparison to the non - photonic electron observables at rhic  @xcite .",
    "in the perturbative qcd - factorization approach , the cause of the limited single non - photonic electron quenching is identified as the small suppression of @xmath2-mesons , which dominate the high-@xmath18 @xmath21 yields .",
    "such models assume that the hard jet hadronizes in vacuum , having fully traversed the region of hot and dense nuclear matter , @xmath22  fm , and lost energy via radiative and collisional processes  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we examined the validity of this assumption for different species of final - state partons and decay hadrons . for a @xmath23  gev pion at mid - rapidity @xmath24  fm @xmath25 , consistent with the jet - quenching assumptions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath2- and @xmath1-mesons of the same @xmath18 have formation times @xmath26  fm , respectively , @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , at the finite @xmath18 range accessible at rhic and lhc a conceptually different approach to the description of @xmath1- and @xmath2-meson quenching in a+a collisions is required , when compared to light hadrons .    - and @xmath2-meson production via collisional dissociation in the qgp in central au+au and cu+cu reactions at rhic  @xcite for gluon rapidity densities @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively  @xcite .",

    "preliminary results on langevin simulations of heavy quark diffusion , which include radiative energy loss , collisional energy loss and quark - resonance interactions , were shown .",
    "while an improved implementation of momentum fluctuations is required for quantitative comparison between data  @xcite and theory  @xcite , we find normal suppression , @xmath37 , and elliptic flow , @xmath38 , hierarchies as function of the heavy quark mass .",

    "we conclude that robust experimental determination of the dominant mechanism for in - medium modification of open heavy flavor would require direct and separate measurements of the @xmath2- and @xmath1-meson @xmath39 and @xmath11 distributions versus @xmath18 and centrality in collisions of heavy nuclei .",
