    "the purpose of this paper is to address the computation and analysis of one - loop shifts to the masses of semi - local planar topological solitons arising in a natural generalization of the abelian higgs model . seen in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time these solitons become semi - local strings whereas their masses give the string tensions , see @xcite-@xcite . at the critical point that marks the phase transition between type i and type ii superconductivity ,",
    "the set of semi - local self - dual topological solitons is an interesting @xmath3-dimensional moduli space , where @xmath4 is the number of quanta of the magnetic flux , see @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , superconducting semilocal ( non self - dual ) strings with very intriguing properties have been discovered in this model @xcite .",
    "computations of one - loop mass corrections will be performed using the heat kernel / zeta function regularization method .",
    "the high - temperature asymptotic expansion of the heat function , see @xcite-@xcite-@xcite-@xcite , is a powerful tool that was applied for the first time to the calculation of kink mass shifts in @xcite -the @xmath5 susy case- and @xcite -the non susy case- .",
    "one - loop corrections to @xmath6 supersymmetric self - dual nielsen - olesen vortices were computed in a similar approach by vassilevich and rebhan - van nieuwenhuizen - wimmer in references @xcite and @xcite . in the second paper",
    ", the authors also showed that the central charge of the susy algebra is modified in one - loop order in such a way that the bogomolny bound is saturated at the semi - classical level . sometime later , we calculated the one - loop mass shift for @xmath7 ( non - susy ) self - dual no vortices carrying a quantum of magnetic flux in reference @xcite .",
    "mass shifts have been given for spherically symmetric self - dual vortices ( when several solitons of a quantum of flux have coinciding centers ) in @xcite up to four magnetic flux quanta .",
    "cruder approximations were also provided for the mass shift of two separated self - dual no vortices -each of them with a quantum of magnetic flux- as a function of the inter - center distance .    in reference",
    "@xcite , we studied the one - loop correction to the energy of a degenerate manifold of kinks that arise in a very interesting family of models with two real scalar fields in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "these field theoretical systems are obtained through dimensional reduction -plus a reality condition- of an @xmath5 supersymmetric wess - zumino model with two chiral super - fields , see @xcite-@xcite-@xcite .",
    "a comparison between the mass shifts of these composite kinks and the correction to the mass of the ordinary @xmath8 kink was offered in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we address a similar , but more difficult , situation in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , comparing one - loop mass corrections of the topological solitons that arise in two planar abelian gauge systems ; one with two complex scalar fields and the other with a single complex scalar field .",
    "the methodology used to accomplish this task is explained in detail in reference @xcite , where a complete list of references can be found .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ",
    "2 we describe the model and develop perturbation theory around one of the vacua .",
    "a one - loop renormalization is also performed .",
    "section  3 is devoted to summarizing the structure of the moduli space of self - dual topological solitons . as a novelty",
    ", we also apply a variation of the de vega - shaposnik method @xcite to find numerical solutions for spherically symmetric topological solitons . in section",
    " 4 , we explain how to obtain one - loop mass shifts in terms of generalized zeta functions of the second - order differential operators ruling the small fluctuations of the bosonic and ghost fields , and in  5 the high - temperature expansion of the heat kernel is used to give the final formula for one - loop mass shifts of semi - local self - dual topological solitons after application of mellin s transforms .",
    "we present our results in section  6 by means of mathematica calculations of the coefficients of the asymptotic series giving the heat functions .",
    "finally , in the appendix we offer several tables where these coefficients are shown .",
    "the semi - local abelian higgs model @xcite describes the minimal coupling between an @xmath1-gauge field @xmath9 and a doublet @xmath10 of complex scalar fields in a phase where the higgs mechanism takes place .",
    "the term semilocal refers to the fact that while the global symmetry of this system is @xmath11 only the @xmath1 factor is gauged . defining non - dimensional space - time variables , @xmath12 , and fields , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ,",
    "from the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath15 and the @xmath1-gauge coupling constant , @xmath16 , the action for the semilocal abelian higgs model in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions reads : @xmath17 \\qquad , \\ ] ] where the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath18 .",
    "the physical spectrum differs from that of the standard ahm model in that , along with the massive vector boson and higgs scalar , there is a complex goldstone field .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 measures the ratio between the square of the masses of the higgs , @xmath20 , and vector particles , @xmath21 .",
    "here , @xmath22 is the higgs field self - coupling .",
    "we choose a system of units where @xmath23 , but @xmath24 has dimensions of length @xmath25 mass .      in order to obtain the feynman rules , we expand the action around a classical vacuum .",
    "we shall profit from the @xmath0 global invariance and we choose a vacuum @xmath26 with real upper and vanishing lower components .",
    "the shift of the fields @xmath27 corresponds to the identification of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively as higgs , real , and complex goldstone fields .",
    "the choice of the feynman-t hooft r - gauge @xmath31 requires a faddeev - popov determinant to restore unitarity , which amounts to introducing a complex ghost field @xmath32 .",

    "the propagator of the complex goldstone boson plus two trivalent and four tetravalent vertices accounting for the interactions of goldstone - anti - goldstone pairs must be added to the feynman rules of the abelian higgs model in the feynman-t hooft gauge .",
    "nevertheless , in order to guarantee that all physical quantities will be ultraviolet finite there is still a remaining piece to be added : the action for the counter - terms .",
