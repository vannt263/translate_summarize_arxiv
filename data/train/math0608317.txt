    "we present an outline of new methods for determining the position and the type of singularities of a certain kind of solutions of difference equations @xcite and use this information to perform painlev analysis on them .",
    "the approach relies on advances in exponential asymptotics and the theory of analyzable functions @xcite .",
    "the main concepts are discussed first .    _",
    "analyzable functions_. introduced by jean calle , these are mostly analytic functions which at singular points are completely described by _ transseries _ , much in the same way as analytic functions are represented at regular points by convergent series .",
    "in contrast with analytic functions ( which are not closed under division ) and with meromorphic functions ( which fail to be stable under integration and composition ) analyzable ones are conjectured to be closed under all operations whence the grand picture of this theory , that all functions of natural origin are analyzable .",
    "in particular , solutions of many classes of differential and difference equations have been shown to be analyzable .",
    "_ transseries_. also introduced by j. ecalle , transseries represent the `` ultimate '' generalization of taylor series .",
    "transseries are formal asymptotic combinations of power series , exponentials and logarithms and contain a wealth of information not only about local but also about global behavior of functions .",
    "one of the simplest nontrivial examples of a transseries is    @xmath3    what distinguishes the expression ( [ l1 ] ) from a usual asymptotic expansion is the presence beyond all orders of the principal series of an exponentially small term which can not be captured by classical poincar asymptoticity .",
    "more general transseries arising in generic ordinary differential and difference equations are doubly infinite series whose terms are powers of @xmath4 multiplied by exponentials ( see e.g. ( [ transs ] ) ) .",
    "these transseries can be determined algorithmically and usually diverge factorially , but can be shown to be borel summable in a suitable sense in some sector . in this sector",
    "the function to which the transseries sums has good analyticity properties and on the edges of the sector typically singularities appear .    _ the correspondence between the formal universe and actual functions_. envisaged by calle to be a `` total '' isomorphism implemented by generalized borel summation , the correspondence has been established rigorously in a number of problems including odes , difference equations and pdes .",
    "the problem of integrability has been and is a subject of substantial research . in the context of differential equations there",
    "exist numerous effective criteria of integrability , among which a crucial role is played by the painlev test ( for extensive references see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an analog of the painlev property for difference equations turns out to be more delicate to define .    in the context of solvability ,",
    "various methods have been proposed by joshi @xcite , ablowitz et al .",
    "@xcite , ramani and grammaticos ( see references in @xcite ) , conte and musette @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a comparative discussion of the various approaches in the literature .",
    "none of these is a proper extension of the painlev test .",
    "one difficulty resides in continuing the solutions @xmath5 of a difference equation , which are defined on a _ discrete set _ , to the complex plane of the independent variable @xmath6 in a natural and effective fashion .",
    "the embedding of @xmath5 must be done in such a way that _ properties are preserved_. it is important for the effectiveness of the analysis that this embedding @xmath5@xmath7@xmath8 is natural , constructive and unique under proper conditions .",
    "it is of course crucial that we are given infinitely many values of the function @xmath5 ; since the accumulation point of @xmath6 is infinity , the behavior of @xmath4 at @xmath9 is key , and then the question boils down to when infinitely many values determine function , and in which class .    to illustrate a point we start with a rather trivial example .",
    "assume that @xmath5 is expressed as a convergent power series in powers of @xmath10    @xmath11 we would then naturally define @xmath12 by    @xmath13    for large enough @xmath14 .",
    "uniqueness is ensured by the analyticity at @xmath9 of @xmath8 . still by analyticity",
    ", @xmath7 preserves all properties .",
    "we can not rely merely on analytic continuation since there are very few classes of equations where solutions are given by convergent power series .",
    "however , as discovered by calle and proved in detail very recently in a general setting by braaksma @xcite , a wide class of arbitrary order difference equations admit formal solutions as borel summable _ transseries_. the class considered by braaksma is of the form    @xmath15    where @xmath16 analytic at @xmath9 in @xmath6 and at @xmath17 in @xmath18 , under genericity assumptions @xcite .",
    "in particular a nonresonance condition is imposed    @xmath19    with @xmath20 iff @xmath21 .",
    "transseries solutions for these equations have many similarities to transseries solutions of differential equations . with some @xmath22 , @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24    in ( [ transs ] ) @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend only on the recurrence ( they are the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , respectively ) , @xmath28 is a free parameter and @xmath29 are formal series in negative integer powers of @xmath6 , independent on @xmath30 . the number @xmath22 is chosen so that all the exponentials in ( [ transs ] ) tend to zero in the chosen sector .",
    "braaksma showed that @xmath31 are borel summable uniformly in @xmath32 .",
    ". then @xmath34 are analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath35 ( in fact in a larger sector ) .",
    "defining    @xmath36    we have uniform estimates @xmath37 and thus the series @xmath38 is classically convergent for large enough @xmath6 .",
    "braaksma showed that @xmath39 is an actual solution of ( [ de ] ) .",
    "it is natural to replace @xmath6 by @xmath14 in ( [ -2 ] ) and define : @xmath40 if @xmath14 and all constants are real and @xmath41 , the functions ( [ eq : transss ] ) are special cases of calle s _ analyzable _ functions . as explained before we are allowing for @xmath14 and constants to be complex , under restriction @xmath42 .",
    "it is crucial that the values of @xmath43 for all large enough @xmath6 uniquely determine the expansion . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that under suitable conditions , _ two distinct analyzable functions can not agree on a set of points accumulating at infinity .",
    "_ below is a simplified version of a theorem in @xcite .",
    "assume    @xmath44 and @xmath45 . if @xmath46 for all large enough @xmath47 , then @xmath48 is identically zero .",
    "analyzable functions behave in most respects as analytic functions . among the common properties , particularly important is the uniqueness of the extension from sets with accumulation points , implying the principle of permanence of relations . under the assumptions @xcite",
    "that ensure borel summability , we have the following .",
    "[ d3 ] if    @xmath49    then we call    @xmath50    the analyzable embedding of @xmath51 from @xmath52 to a sector in @xmath53 .    having now a suitable procedure of analytic continuation , we can define the isolated movable singularity property , an extension of the painlev property to difference equations , in a natural fashion . in analogy with the case of differential equations",
    "we require that all solutions are free from `` bad '' movable singularities .",
    "a difference equation has the imsp if all _ movable _ singularities of all its solutions are * isolated .",
    "*    * notes . * ( i ) we use the common convention that isolated singularity exclude branch points , clusters of poles and barriers of singularities .",
    "\\(ii ) to determine the singularities , transasymptotic matching methods introduced for differential equations in @xcite , can be extended with little changes to difference equations .",
    "we look at autonomous difference equations of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is meromorphic and has attracting fixed points .",
    "a more general analysis is given in @xcite .",
    "we then write @xmath56    and restrict for simplicity to the case @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "there is a one - parameter family of solutions presented as simple transseries _ convergent _ for large enough @xmath6 , of the form    @xmath59    for given values of @xmath60 , independent of @xmath61 .",
    "the analyzable embedding of @xmath4 , cf .",
    "definition [ d3 ] , reads @xmath62    which is analytic for large enough @xmath14 . to look for the imsp",
    ", we find the properties of @xmath8 beyond the domain of convergence of ( [ eq:2z ] ) , and find the singular points of @xmath8 .    * note . * because equation ( [ eq:01 ] ) is nonlinear , although ( [ eq:2z ] ) has one continuous parameter , there may be more solutions .",
    "this issue is addressed in ( @xcite ) .      by the poincar conjugation theorem",
    "applied to @xmath54 there exists a unique map @xmath63 with the properties    @xmath64    and such that @xmath65 implies @xmath66 .",
    "the map @xmath63 is a conjugation map of @xmath67 with its linearization @xmath68 .",
    "we have @xmath69 .",
    "we obtain an extension of @xmath4 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 through    @xmath70    then the conjugation map satisfies the equation @xmath71    as expected by the uniqueness of the embedding in definition  [ d3 ] we have the following .

    "these equations are explicitly solvable , and thus autonomous equations of the first order which have the imsp can be solved in closed form .",
    "[ t1 ] the equation ( [ eq:01 ] ) under the given assumptions _ fails _ to have the imsp _ unless _ , for some @xmath73 , @xmath74 in case ( [ ( * * ) ] we have : @xmath75    it is also very interesting to see that in the case of failure of the imsp the analytic properties of the solutions preclude the existence of nice constants of motion . this is discussed in the next section .",
    "we illustrate this situation when @xmath55 polynomial .",
    "the surprising conclusion is that for polynomial @xmath55 without the imsp , constants of motion ( defined as functions @xmath76 constant along trajectories ) develop barriers of singularities along some fractal closed curves @xmath77 , see below . in a neighborhood of the origin ,",
    "the function @xmath63 is invertible , and thus for small @xmath4 we derive from @xmath78 that @xmath79 where @xmath80 .    in fig .",

    "1 ) the maximal connected component of the origin in the fatou set of @xmath55 .",
    "then the domain of analyticity of @xmath82 is @xmath81 , and @xmath77 is a barrier of singularities of @xmath82 .",
    "the proofs of these results can be found in @xcite . the logistic map discussed in relative detail in the next section represents a very simple illustration of some of the relevant phenomena .",
    "we show that the equation @xmath0 has the imsp iff @xmath83 .",
    "the case @xmath84 needs no analysis .",
    "otherwise , taking @xmath85 we get      for small @xmath87 , the leading order form of equation ( [ eq:111 ] ) is @xmath88 whose solution is @xmath89 .",
    "it is then convenient to seek solutions of ( [ eq:111 ] ) in the form @xmath90 whence the initial condition implies @xmath91 , @xmath92 . denoting @xmath93 ,",
    "the functional relation satisfied by @xmath94 is      [ l11 ] ( i ) there exists a unique analytic function @xmath94 in the neighborhood of the origin satisfying ( [ eq:112 ] ) and such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this @xmath94 has only isolated singularities in @xmath53 if and only if @xmath96 . in the latter case",
    ", the equations ( [ eq:112 ] ) and ( [ eq:111 ] ) can be solved explicitly ( see ( [ 114.5 ] ) , ( [ 119 ] ) and ( [ 120 ] ) ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for small @xmath104 , @xmath105 is contractive in the ball of radius @xmath106 in the space of functions of the form @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is analytic in the disk @xmath109 with the norm @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath94 is analytic for small @xmath14 and is a conjugation map between ( [ eq:111 ] ) and its small-@xmath111 approximation .",
    "now the question is to determine the singularities of @xmath94 in the complex plane .",
    "inside the unit disk we can inductively continue @xmath94 analytically through ( [ eq:113 ] ) as follows",
    ". if @xmath94 is analytic in a disk of radius @xmath112 then ( [ eq:113 ] ) provides the analytic continuation in the disk of radius @xmath113 if @xmath114 is not zero or @xmath115 .",
    "because @xmath94 is assumed to be analytic in the disk of radius @xmath116 , @xmath114 can not vanish ; otherwise by ( [ eq:112 ] ) it would vanish infinitely often in a neighborhood of zero , which is inconsistent with its analyticity at @xmath117 and with @xmath92 . but the equation @xmath118 does have solutions in the unit disk if @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , with @xmath119 it is immediate to show @xmath118 implies @xmath120 as @xmath121 . since @xmath94 is , by the condition @xmath92 , bijective near @xmath117 , the equation @xmath122 has a ( unique ) solution , @xmath123 for sufficiently large @xmath6 .",
    "now , if @xmath124 is such that @xmath125 we have @xmath126 .",
    "but then @xmath94 has a square root branch point at @xmath127 since @xmath128 can not vanish anywhere inside the unit disk , otherwise again by ( [ eq:112 ] ) , @xmath128 would vanish infinitely often near the origin .",
    "we claim that unless @xmath130 , the point @xmath131 is a singular point of @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , a taylor series expansion @xmath132 gives @xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath133 implies @xmath135 for all @xmath136 which contradicts @xmath92 .",
    "therefore @xmath134 in which case direct calculation shows that , unless @xmath137 for some @xmath138 , all @xmath139 for @xmath140 are zero which is not possible since @xmath91 . if @xmath141 then @xmath119 .                                      where @xmath155 is a rational function .",
    "thus if @xmath156 and @xmath94 is analytic at @xmath157 then it is meromorphic at @xmath131 , while the set of points such that @xmath156 is dense on the unit circle .",
    "the last case to analyze is @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the ( maximal ) radius of analyticity of @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:113 ] ) shows that on the disk of radius @xmath159 the singularities of @xmath94 are square root branch points . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath160 is an algebraic branch point and @xmath161 then @xmath124 is also an algebraic branch point as can be seen by continuing ( [ eq:112 ] ) around a small circle near the branch point @xmath162 .",
