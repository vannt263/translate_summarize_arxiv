    "pulsars are highly magnetized with predominantly dipolar field structure .",
    "the rotating magnetic field produces a strong induced electric field that accelerates charged particles off the surface of the star into a magnetosphere consisting of predominantly dipolar magnetic field and corotating relativistic pair plasma .",
    "pulsar radio emission models assume that radiation emitted tangentially to the field lines on which plasma is moving .",
    "the polarization state of the emitted radiation is more or less determined by the structure of magnetic field at the emission spot . in the general framework of models in which the radio power is curvature radiation emitted by charge bunches constrained to follow field lines , the linear polarization is intrinsic to the emission mechanism and is , furthermore , a purely geometric property .",
    "several pulsar researchers have shown that the properties such as the polarization angle swing can be explained within the framework of curvature radiation ( e.g. , radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ; sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; lyne & manchester 1988 ; rankin 1990 , 1993 ; blaskiewicz et  al .",
    ".    the radio emission from particle bunches is highly polarized , and the radiation received by distant observer will be less polarized due to the incoherent superposition of emissions from different magnetic field lines ( gil & rudnicki 1985 ) .",
    "gil ( 1986 ) has argued for the connection between pulsar emission beams and polarization modes and suggested that out of two orthogonal polarization modes one corresponds to core emission and other to the conal emissions .",
    "they are highly linearly polarized and the observed depolarization is due to superposition of modes at any instant ( gil 1987 ) . by considering a charged particle moving along the curved trajectory ( circular ) confined to the @xmath0-plane , gil and snakowski ( 1990a ) have deduced the polarization state of the emitted radiation , and shown the creation of antisymmetric circular polarization in curvature radiation . by introducing a phase , as a propagation effect , the difference between the components of radiation electric field in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the plane of particle trajectory , gil and snakowski ( 1990b ) have developed a model to explain the depolarization and polarization angle deviations in subpulses and micropulses .",
    "gil , kijak and zycki ( 1993 ) have modeled the single pulse polarization characteristics of pulsar radiation , and demonstrated that the deviations of the single pulse position angle from the average are caused by both propagation and geometrical effects .",
    "mitra , gil and melikdze ( 2009 ) by analysing the strong single pulses with highly polarized subpulses from a set of pulsars , have given a very conclusive arguments in favor of the coherent curvature radiation mechanism as the pulsar radio emission mechanism .    by analyzing the average pulse profiles , radhakrishnan and rankin ( 1990 )",
    "have identified two most probable types of circular polarizations , namely , _",
    "antisymmetric , _ where the circular polarization changes sense near the core region , and _ symmetric , _ where the circular polarization remains with same sense .",
    "they found that antisymmetric circular polarization is correlated with the polarization angle swing , and speculate it to be a geometric property of the emission mechanism .",
    "han et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , by considering the published mean profiles , found a correlation between the sense of circular polarization and polarization angle swing in conal double profiles , and no significant correlation for core components .",
    "further , you and han ( 2006 ) have reconfirmed these investigations with a larger data .",
    "however , cordes et  al .",
    "( 1978 ) were the first to point out an association between the position angle of the linear polarization and the handedness of the circular polarization .",
    "there are two types of claims for the origin of circular polarization : intrinsic to the emission mechanism ( e.g. , michel 1987 ; gil & snakowski 1990a , b ; radhakrishnan & rankin 1990 ; gangadhara 1997 ) or generated by the propagation effects ( e.g. , cheng & ruderman 1979 ) .",
    "cheng and ruderman ( 1979 ) have suggested that the expected asymmetry between the positively and negatively charged components of the magnetoactive plasma in the far magnetosphere of pulsars will convert linear polarization to circular polarization .",
    "radhakrishnan and rankin ( 1990 ) have suggested that the propagation origin of antisymmetric circular polarization is very unlikely but the symmetric circular polarization appears to be possible . on the other hand , kazbegi , machabeli and melikidze ( 1991 , 1992 )",
    "have argued that the cyclotron instability , rather than the propagation effect , is responsible for the circular polarization of pulsars .",
    "lyubarskii and petrova ( 1999 ) considered that the rotation of the magnetosphere gives rise to wave mode coupling in the polarization - limiting region , which can result in circular polarization in linearly polarized normal waves .",
    "melrose and luo ( 2004 ) discussed possible circular polarization induced by intrinsically relativistic effects of pulsar plasma .",
    "melrose ( 2003 ) reviewed the properties of intrinsic circular polarization and circular polarization due to cyclotron absorption and presented a plausible explanation of circular polarization in terms of propagation effects in an inhomogeneous birefringent plasma .",
    "in the multifrequency simultaneous observations we do find the variations in the single pulse polarization , which may be attributed to the propagation effects ( karastergiou et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; karastergiou , johnston & kramer 2003 ) .",
    "the correlation between the antisymmetric circular polarization and the polarization angle swing is a geometric property of the emission processes ( radhakrishnan and rankin 1990 ) . by carefully modeling the polarization state of the radiation in terms of stokes parameters ,",
    "it is possible to construct the geometry of emission region at multifrequencies .",
    "so far , in the purview of curvature radiation only the polarization angle has been modeled ( radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ; komesaroff 1970 ) and attempted to fit it with the average radio profile data ( e.g. , lyne & manchester 1988 ) . instead of circular trajectories , it is very important to consider the actual dipolar magnetic field lines , whose curvature radii vary as a function of altitude , as the radio emission in pulsars is expected to come from the range of altitude ( e.g. , gangadhara & gupta 2001 ; gupta & gangadhara 2003 ; krzeszowski et al . 2009 ) . in this paper , we develop a three - dimensional ( 3d ) model for curvature radiation by relativistic sources accelerated along the dipolar magnetic field lines .",
    "we consider the actual dipolar magnetic field lines ( not the circles ) in a slowly rotating ( non - rotating ) magnetosphere such that the rotation effects can be ignored .",
    "the relativistic plasma ( bunch , i.e. , a point - like huge charge ) moving along the dipolar magnetic field lines emits curvature radiation .",
    "we show that _ our model reproduces polarization angle swing of radhakrishnan and cooke ( 1969 ) , and predicts that the correlation of antisymmetric circular polarization and polarization angle swing is a geometric property of the emission process_. our model is aimed at re - examining the intrinsic polarization properties of the vacuum single - particle cuvature radiation , and planed to consider the propagation effects separately in the subsequent works .",
    "we derive electric fields of the radiation field in section  2 and construct the stokes parameters of the radiation field in section  3 . a few model ( simulated )",
    "profiles are presented in section  4 depicting the correlation between the antisymmetric circular polarization and polarization angle swing in the different cases of viewing geometry parameters .",
    "consider a magnetosphere having dipole magnetic field with an axis @xmath1 inclined by an angle @xmath2 with respect to the rotation axis @xmath3 ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetosphere is stationary or slowly rotating such that the rotation effects are negligible . the relativistic pair plasma , generated by induced electric field followed by pair creation , constrained to move along the curved dipolar magnetic field lines .",
    "the high brightness temperature of pulsar indicates coherency of the pulsar radiation , which in tern forces one to postulate the existence of charged bunches .",
    "the formation of bunches in the form of solitons has been proposed ( e.g. , cheng & ruderman 1979 ; melikidze & patarya 1980 , 1984 ) and questioned ( e.g. , melrose 1992 ) .",
    "gil , lyubarsky and melikidze ( 2004 ) have generalized the soliton model by including formation and propagation of the coherent radiation in the magnetospheric plasma along magnetic field lines .",
    "their results strongly support coherent curvature radiation by the spark - associated solitons as a plausible mechanism of pulsar radio emission . following these views",
    ", we assume that the plasma in the form of bunches moves along the open field lines of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "consider the source s moving along the magnetic field line c , and experiencing acceleration ( @xmath4 ) in the direction of curvature vector of the field line .",
    "we assume that the source to be a bunch , which is nothing more than a point - like huge charge",
    ". in cartesian coordinates , the position vector of a bunch moving along the dipolar magnetic field line is given by ( see equation ( 2 ) in gangadhara 2004 , hereafter g04 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the field line constant , and the angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the magnetic colatitude and azimuth , respectively .",
    "next , @xmath9 is the rotation phase and @xmath2 is the inclination angle of the magnetic axis .",
    "equation  ( [ r ] ) describes the dipolar magnetic field lines presented in figure  1 .",
    "then the velocity of bunch is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnetic field line tangent .",
    "consider the magnetic axis : @xmath12    due to curvature in the field lines , the plasma bunch , a point - like huge charge , collectively radiates relativistically beamed radiation in the direction of velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the velocity @xmath13 is parallel to the tangent @xmath14 of the field line . to receive the beamed emission ,",
    "the observer s line of sight ( @xmath15 ) must align with @xmath13 within the beaming angle @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lorentz factor of the bunch .",
    "in other words a distant observer at p receives beamed emission only when @xmath18 for @xmath19 where @xmath20 let @xmath21 be the arc length of the field line then @xmath22 where @xmath23 and the magnitude of velocity @xmath24 where the parameter @xmath25 specifies the speed of bunch as a fraction of the speed of light @xmath26 . hence",
    ", we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the angle between @xmath1 and @xmath30 in terms of polar angle @xmath31 the angle @xmath29 given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the bi - normal to the field line .",
    "we solve equation  ( [ tau ] ) for @xmath31 and obtain @xmath35 hence , from equation  ( [ v ] ) it is clear that to receive the radiation emitted in the direction of tangent @xmath36 the line sight line @xmath15 must line up with it .",
    "so , by solving @xmath37 or @xmath38 we can identify the tangent @xmath39 which aligns with @xmath40 and hence find the field line curvature and the coordinates @xmath41 of the emission spot ( see equations ( 4 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 11 ) in g04 ) .",

    "we observe that the range of @xmath7 stays nearly constant ( or decreasing negligibly ) whereas that of @xmath8 gets narrower with respect to the increasing @xmath150",
    "to understand the pulsar radio emission , we must model all the stokes parameters ( @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 and @xmath154 a set of parameters used to specify the phase and polarization of radiation ) , and compare with observations .",

    "let @xmath158 be the energy radiated coherently per unit solid angle per unit frequency interval per particle bunch ( jackson 1975 ) , then @xmath159 since the stokes parameter @xmath160 we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq_e_ster_nu ] ) as @xmath161 similarly , we can express @xmath152 @xmath153 and @xmath154 as @xmath162 the net emission , which the observer receives along @xmath15 , will have contributions from the neighboring field lines , whose tangents are within the angle @xmath129 with respect to @xmath121 hence the radiation received at any given phase is the net contribution from a small tube of field lines having an angular width of about @xmath163 thus the radiation in the direction of @xmath15 should be integrated over a solid angle @xmath164 we choose limits on the angles @xmath8 and @xmath7 such that the integration over them will cover the solid angular region ( beaming region ) of radial width @xmath129 around @xmath121 since @xmath7 and @xmath8 are orthogonal , choosing them as the variables of integration is justified .",
    "we assume ( i ) the width of bunch @xmath165 is much smaller than the wavelength @xmath166 of the radio waves , so that the radiation emitted by a bunch is coherent , and ( ii ) the bunches , within the beaming region , are closely spaced , so that the net emission becomes smooth and continuous .",
    "consider a bunch having @xmath167 emitting radio waves at frequency @xmath168  mhz at an altitude of about 400  km .",
    "note that these values are closer to those estimated in g04 in the case of psr  b0329 + 54 .",
    "then the angular width of the beaming region corresponding to @xmath169 is @xmath170 which corresponds to width of @xmath171  km at an altitude of 400 km . for coherence to be effective the bunch width @xmath172 therefore ,",

    "the emission in spin - powered pulsars is mostly of non - thermal origin .",
    "if the radiation field @xmath120 from different sources does not bear any phase relation then they are expected to be incoherently superposed on the observation point . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a phase relation then they are coherently superposed . from the observational point of view",
    "both the cases are important .    by considering the relativistic pair plasma with @xmath184 accelerated along the dipolar field lines of a pulsar with period @xmath185  s , we computed the polarization parameters and plotted them in figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "it shows a stronger emission near the meridional plane , where the beaming region is broader ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) and the radius of curvature @xmath186 goes to a minimum . the profile of linear polarization @xmath187 resembles the intensity profile , except for its lower magnitude due to the incoherent addition . to describe the behaviors of circular polarization @xmath188 and polarization angle @xmath189",
    ", we define the symbols : ` @xmath190 ' for transition of the right hand circular to left hand circular , ` @xmath191 ' for left hand circular to right hand circular , ` cw ' for clockwise rotation of the polarization angle , and ` ccw ' for counter clockwise rotation .",
    "since the circular polarization @xmath188 changes sign as @xmath190 or @xmath191 as the sight line cuts across the field line , the net circular polarization goes to zero in an uniform emission due to the addition with opposite signs .",
    "the polarization angle swings reproduced in figure  [ f5 ] are consistent with the rotating vector model of radhakrishnan and cooke ( 1969 ) . in the case of positive sight line impact parameter",
    "@xmath192 the polarization angle swing is ccw as the slope @xmath193 while in the negative case @xmath194 it is cw as @xmath195      pulsar radio emission is believed to come from mostly open magnetic field lines , whose foot points define the polar cap .",
    "the shape of pulsar profiles indicates that the entire polar cap does not radiate , only some selected regions radiate , which may be organized into a central core emission and coaxial conal emissions , which has an overwhelming support from observations ( e.g. , rankin 1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "hence the radiating region above the polar is believed to have a central column of emission ( core ) and a few coaxial conal regions of emission ( cones ) ( e.g. , gil & krawczyk 1997 ; gangadhara & gupta 2001 ; gupta & gangadhara 2003 ; dyks , rudak & harding 2004 ) .",
    "it is well known that the components of a pulsar profile can be decomposed into individual gaussians by fitting one with each of the subpulse component .",
    "for example the components in the pulse profile of psr  1706 - 16 and psr  2351 + 61 are fitted with appropriate gaussians by kramer et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) . when the line  of  sight crosses the emission region , it encounters a pattern in intensity due to gaussian modulation in the azimuthal direction .",
    "because of the gaussian modulation in the azimuthal direction , the intensity becomes nonuniform in the polar directions too .",
    "these arguments indicate that a gaussian - like intensity modulation exists in the polar directions too .",
    "so , we assume that the emission region of a pulse component has an intensity modulation both in the azimuthal directions .",
    "hence we define a modulation function @xmath196 for a pulse component as @xmath197~,\\ ] ] where @xmath198 is the peak location of the gaussian function and @xmath199 is the amplitude .",
    "if @xmath200 is the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) then @xmath201    taking into account of modulation , equations ( [ is])([quvs ] ) can be written as @xmath202    using a gaussian with peak located at the meridional plane @xmath203 we have computed the pulse profiles in the two cases of impact parameter @xmath204 and inclination angles @xmath205 and plotted in figures  [ f6 ] and [ f7 ] . we observe that the profile in the case of negative @xmath92 is broader than the positive case .",
    "this difference is due to the projection of emission region on to the equatorial plane of the pulsar . in the case of positive @xmath206",
    "the polarization angle @xmath207 swing is ccw and the sign change of @xmath188 is @xmath190 with respect to @xmath77 while in the case of negative @xmath92 the @xmath207 swing is cw and the sign change of @xmath188 is @xmath208 hence we find that _ the polarization angle swing is correlated with the circular polarization sign reversal .",
    "_ this correlation is invariant with respect the stellar spin directions .",
    "the mean pulsar profiles often found to consist of odd number of multi - components or subpulses .",
    "many of the works on pulsar profiles ( e.g. , rankin 1990 , 1993 ; mitra & deshpande 1999 ) have proposed that the pulsar emission beam has a nested conal structure . to investigate the polarization of sub - pulses in such profiles , we have reproduced a five component profile by considering three gaussians in figure  [ f8 ] , and five gaussians in figures  [ f9 ] and [ f10 ] .",
    "the central component is presumed to be a core , and the other components are symmetrically located on either side of the core forming the cones .",
    "we find across each component that circular polarization changes the sign and is correlated with the polarization angle swing .",
    "we also observe that the circular polarization of the outermost components is weaker compared to that of inner ones , which is quite clear in the case of large inclination angles .",
    "this is due to the fact that the sight line crosses the field lines in the almost edge - on position in the case of outermost components .",
    "the small distortions in the polarization angle curve are due to modulation .",
    "observed pulsar radio luminosities together with the small source size imply extraordinarily high brightness temperatures , i.e. , as high as @xmath209  k. the incoherent sum of a single - particle curvature radiation is not enough to explain the very high brightness temperature of pulsar radio emission , therefore , one is forced to postulate the existence of charged bunches . to avoid",
    "implausibly high particle densities and energies , coherent radiation processes are invoked .",
    "pacini and rees ( 1970 ) , and sturrock ( 1971 ) among others were quick to point out that the observed coherence may be due to bunching of particles in the emission region of the magnetosphere .",
    "the problem of bunch formation has been known for many decades , and it has already been addressed by many authors ( e.g. , karpman et al .",
    "1975 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; cox 1979 ; asseo , pelletier & sol 1990 ; gil , lyubarsky & melikidze 2004 ) . the natural mechanism for the formation of charged bunches was first proposed by karpman et al .",
    "they have argued that the modulational instability in the turbulent plasma generates charged solitons , provided that species of different charges have different masses .",
    "one should mention here that to explain coherent radio emission we do not necessarily need stable solitons but only large - scale ( as compared with the langmuir wavelength ) charge density fluctuations .",
    "gil , lyubarsky and melikidze ( 2004 ) generalized the soliton model by including formation and propagation of the coherent radiation in the magnetospheric plasma .",
    "however , it is not easy to form such charge bunches ( see melrose 1992 for a review ) .",
    "further , michel ( 1991 ) has pointed out that the pair - production discharge mechanism originally applied to pulsars by sturrock automatically produces dense bunches that can produce coherence at radio frequencies with sufficient intensity to simulate pulsar action . if the bunches of plasma particles with sizes much smaller than a wavelength of radiation exist then the net radiation field @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the number of charges present in the bunch .",
    "hence the total radiation field due to a bunch of particles is equal to the vector sum of the fields radiated by each charge .    in the general framework of models including ours ,",
    "in which the radio power is curvature radiation emitted by charge bunches constrained to follow the field lines , the linear polarization is intrinsic to the emission mechanism and is , furthermore , a purely geometric property . in this direction",
    "the recently acheieved observational results and the model predications based on them by mitra , gil and melikidze ( 2009 ) become very relevant .",
    "they find that the polarization angle of linear polarization in subpulses follow closely the mean polarization angle curve at the corresponding profile components and argue that their findings favor coherent curvature radiation over maser mechanism as the observed emission .    in an actual case , it is the combination of both incoherent and coherent superpositions determining the polarization state of the observed emission .",
    "though the emissions from a single bunch is highly polarized , the radiation received by a distant observer will be less polarized , as the radiation from many bunches is incoherently superposed ( gil & rudnicki 1985 ) .",
    "also , the degree of polarization is found , depending on the time resolution chosen in the observation ( gangadhara et  al .",
    "circular polarization is generally strongest in the central regions of a profile , but is by no means confined to these regions .",
    "it has been detected from conal components of many pulsars , for example , conal - double pulsars and found to be highly correlated with the polarization angle swing ( you & han 2006 ) . in",
    "most of the cases the sense reversal of circular polarization is nearly independent of frequency , suggesting that the circular polarization does not arise from propagation or plasma effects ( michel 1987 ; radhakrishnan & rankin 1990 ) .",
    "radhakrishnan and rankin ( 1990 ) have argued that the circular polarization is intrinsically antisymmetric type and correlated with the polarization angle swing .",
    "the antisymmetric circular polarization of curvature radiation becomes significant if there are gradients in the emissivity over angular scales comparable with the emission cone of single charge .",
    "their results are consistent with the predictions of our model ( figures [ f6 ]  [ f10 ] ) and strongly suggest that the correlation of antisymmetric circular polarization with the polarization angle swing is a geometric property of emission mechanism .",
    "since our model deals with steady flow of relativistic plasma bunches along dipolar field lines , it is relevent only for average profiles , and reflects the results which are more of geometric dependent .",
    "we have not considered any fluctuations or instability in the plasma flow .",
    "hence it can not reproduce the behaviors of single pulses .    by adopting the antenna mechanism , buschauer and benford ( 1976 )",
    "have derived a new formalism for the relativistic curvature radiation .",
    "however , the treatment given does not include the detailed geometry of dipolar field lines and the estimation of polarization , particularly circular , as we have considered in our model .",
    "since radiation from many bunches is superposed on any given pulse longitude , the circular polarization of different signs and magnitudes is added .",
    "the result of such an addition could be the reason for the diversities in the observed circular polarization .",
    "since our model was aimed at analyzing the intrinsic polarization properties of coherent radiation , we plan to consider the propagation effects separately in the subsequent works .",
    "we speculate that the propagation origin of antisymmetric circular polarization is very unlikely but the symmetric circular polarization may be possible .",
    "by taking into account of a detailed geometry of dipolar magnetic field lines , we have derived the polarization state of the coherent curvature radiation due to relativistic plasma in the pulsar magnetosphere , and drawn the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "we do confirm the previous results of gil et  al .",
    "( 1990a , b ; 1993 ) that coherent curvature radiation has basically antisymmetric type of circular polarization . though the emission from a single bunch is highly polarized , the net emission from many bunches within the beaming region is less polarized due to the incoherent superposition of radiation fields .",
    "2 .   based on the stokes parameters of the curvature radiation",
    "we have deduced the polarization angle swing , i.e. , the rotating vector model .",
    "3 .   based on the coherent curvature radiation ,",
    "we have achieved for the first time the result that _ the antisymmetric type of circular polarization is correlated with the polarization angle swing , _ and such correlations have been indeed found in the profiles of many pulsars .",
    "4 .   the addition of circular polarization with different signs and magnitudes at any given phase could be responsible for the wide diversity in circular polarization across the pulse .",
    "it is consistent with the earlier results ( e.g. , gil et  al . 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "i thank j. l. han and j. m. rankin for illuminating discussions .",
