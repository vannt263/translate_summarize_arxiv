    "accretion disks are important in several astrophysical systems . they can be found around young stellar objects(yso ) , around compact stellar objects in our galaxy and around several super - massive black holes in active galactic nuclei(agn ) .    in super massive accretion disks",
    "the mass of black hole is @xmath0 . to study such disks we use the general relativity with relativistic hydrodynamics in kerr metric background geometry . in relativistic navier - stokes fluid",
    "we have stress - energy tensor which is related to viscosity and is the cause of redistribution of energy and momentum in fluid .",
    "this tensor is defined by the four velocity and metric . in the previous studies ,",
    "the relativistic and stationary solutions of standard black hole disks were solved .",
    "lasota ( 1994 ) was the first who wrote down slim - disk equations which include relativistic effects .",
    "he also assumed that only r-@xmath1 component of the stress tensor is nonzero .",
    "he used a special form for this component , which was followed by abramowicz et al(1996 and 1997 ) .",
    "chakrabarti ( 1996 ) derived the transonic solutions of thick and thin disks for a weak viscosity .",
    "he assumed similar form for viscosity as lasota ( 1994 ) .",
    "then manmoto ( 2000 ) derived the global two temperatures structure of advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) numerically by using full relativistic hydrodynamical equations including the energy equations for the ions and electrons .",
    "papaloizou & szuskiewicz ( 1994 ) introduced a phenomenological and non - relativistic equation for the evolution of viscous stress tensor ( causal viscosity ) which has been used by many authors .",
    "gammie & popham ( 1998 ) and popham & gammie ( 1998 ) solved adafs with relativistic causal viscosity .",
    "they used the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "takahashi ( 2007b ) solved the equations of relativistic disks in the kerr - schild coordinates by using the relativistic causal viscosity . in the papers of gammie & popham and takahashi they assumed that in the frf",
    ", only the @xmath2 component of shear viscosity is nonzero , then they used the transformation tensors to derive the components of shear stress tensor in the boyer - lindquist or kerr - schild frames .",
    "in present study , we concentrate on the stationary axisymmetric accretion flow in the equatorial plane .",
    "we use a new method to calculate the shear tensor and azimuthal velocity of fluids in the locally non - rotating frame ( lnrf ) by using keplerian angular velocity .",
    "we derive two kinds of shear tensors in lnrf and blf ; in the first one the direction of fluid rotation is the same as that of black hole ( @xmath3 ) and in the second one the direction of fluid rotation is in opposite to that of black hole(@xmath4 ) .",
    "we calculate the components of the shear tensor for two kinds of fluids in lnrf , blf and frf , these calculations show that in frf there are two nonzero components ( @xmath5 and @xmath2 components ) . but in previous papers ,",
    "the only nonzero component in frf was @xmath2 component .",
    "the @xmath5 component results from the relativistic calculations of the shear tensor which changes some components of the four velocity .",
    "then , by using these shear tensor components we calculate the four velocity in lnrf , blf and density in all frames .",

    "we derive four velocity in lnrf and blf in @xmath65 and the influence of two important parameters on density and four velocity can be seen in this section .",
    "also , the influence of the @xmath5 component of shear tensor can be seen in this section .",
    "summery and conclusion are given in @xmath66 .",
    "for back ground geometry , we use the boyer - lindquist coordinates of the rotating black hole space time . in the boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",

    "the position of outer and inner horizons , @xmath17 , are calculated by inserting @xmath18 to get @xmath19 .",
    "the angular velocity of the frame dragging due to the black hole rotation is @xmath20 , where m is the black hole mass , g is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light and the angular momentum of the black hole , j , is described as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "similar to gammie & popham ( 1998 ) , we set @xmath23 for basic scalings .",
    "the nonzero components of metric , @xmath24 , and its inverse , @xmath25 are calculated in appendix 1 .      in our study , we use three reference frames .",
    "the first one is the boyer - lindquist frame ( blf ) based on the boyer - lindquist coordinates describing the metric , in which , our calculations are done .",
    "the second one is the locally non - rotating reference frame ( lnrf ) which is formed by observers with a future - directed unit vector orthogonal to @xmath26 . by using the boyer - lindquist coordinates ,",
    "the lnrf observer is moving with the angular velocity of frame dragging ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the third frame is fluid rest frame ( frf ) , an orthonormal tetrad basis carried by observers moving along the fluid .",

    "the transformation matrixes of frf , lnrf and blf are given in appendix 2 ( bardeen 1970 ; bardeen , press & teukolsky 1972 ; frolov & novikov 1998 ) .",
    "the basic equations for the relativistic hydrodynamics are the baryon - mass conservation @xmath32 and the energy momentum conservation ; @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the rest - mass density and @xmath35 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "basic dynamical equations except the baryon mass conservation are calculated from the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath35 .",
    "we use the energy - momentum tensor written as : @xmath36 where p is the pressure , @xmath37 is the relativistic enthalpy , u is the internal energy , @xmath38 is the viscous stress - energy tensor and @xmath39 is the heat - flux four vector .",

    "we also assume that the effects of the bulk viscosity and heat - flux four vector is negligible . in the following sections",
    ", we derive the basic equations using the vertical averaging procedures around the equatorial plane which were derived in , e.g. , gammie & popham ( 1998 ) .",

    "if we normalize the rest - mass density , @xmath34 , by setting @xmath56 , for calculating global structure of accretion flow , we have : @xmath57 also , by differentiating equation ( [ 11 ] ) we have : @xmath58      two specific killing vectors of kerr metric are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which are used to derive the disk equations . at first",
    ", angular momentum conservation can be derived by @xmath61 @xmath62 by vertically averaging equation ( [ 13 ] ) we have : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total inward flux of angular momentum .",
    "this equation is similar to the angular momentum equation of gammie & popham ( 1998 ) .",
    "another equation which can be obtained by using @xmath65 is : @xmath66 similarly , by vertically averaging and inserting constant @xmath67 , we have : @xmath68 this equation expresses the constancy of mass - energy flux @xmath67 in terms of the radius ; @xmath67 is the actual rate of change of the black hole mass .",
    "if the fluid is cold and slow at large radiuses , then @xmath69 ( gammie & popham 1998 ) .      the equation of local energy conservation is obtained from @xmath70 , as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is defined as : @xmath73 and from equation ( [ 7 ] ) we have : @xmath74 therefore the energy equation can be written as : @xmath75 in this paper we do not derive the temperature , pressure and internal energy so that , we will not use this equation . if we want to derive these variables we must use a state equation and use the relation of shear tensor components .",
