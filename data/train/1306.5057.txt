    "the firewall paradox @xcite of quantum black holes poses a profound question about the relation between quantum information and quantum gravity . with the advent of ads",
    "/ cft @xcite , black hole evaporation processes are now widely believed to be unitary @xcite .",
    "it seems likely that all information stored in the interior of a black hole may be imprinted into outside radiation and eventually released to the spatial infinity .",
    "superficially , this process may be accompanied by a quantum - cloning - like mechanism to generate the informative radiation . however , invoking the concept of black hole complementarity @xcite saves the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the complementarity maintains the semiclassical picture in which a free - falling observer experiences nothing out of the ordinary when crossing the horizon .",
    "however , almheiri et al . ( amps ) recently argued @xcite that the absence of drama for the infalling observer contradicts the following natural postulates as follows :    postulate 1 : the process of formation and evaporation of a black hole , as viewed by a distant observer , can be described entirely within the context of standard quantum theory . in particular , there exists a unitary @xmath0 matrix that describes the evolution from infalling matter to outgoing hawking - like radiation .",
    "postulate 2 : outside the stretched horizon of a massive black hole , physics can be described to a good approximation by a set of semiclassical field equations .",
    "assuming postulates 1 and 2 , amps analyze the entanglement ability of gaining information about late - time radiation for a sufficiently old black hole via measurements of early - time radiation .",
    "they then conclude that infalling observers will encounter high - average - energy modes of the late - time radiation and burn up at the horizon .",
    "because of postulate 1 , the final state @xmath1 of black hole evaporation is assumed to be pure .",
    "they divide the system into an early radiation part @xmath2 and a late radiation part @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed that there is a natural uv cutoff in the black hole physics and that the hilbert spaces of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have finite discrete dimensions @xmath4and@xmath5 . using an arbitrary complete basis @xmath6 ,",
    "the final state @xmath1 can be expanded as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an unnormalized state of @xmath2 . using the same philosophy of typical - state entanglement @xcite",
    ", one can argue that @xmath3 is fully entangled with @xmath2 in the state @xmath1 .",
    "thus , amps assume that a measurement of @xmath2 outputting a result @xmath9 exists such that the post - measurement state of @xmath3 is nearly equal to an arbitrarily fixed @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , a measurement of the number of outgoing @xmath3 particles may be expected , in which@xmath11 becomes a number eigenstate of the particles .",
    "going back in time , the particles in state @xmath10 are present near the horizon and severely blueshifted by the strong gravitational force .",
    "each particle carries quite a huge amount of energy ",
    "much larger than the hawking temperature of the black hole .",
    "thus amps expects that the energy expectation value of the particles also becomes divergent .",
    "this high - average - energy flux of the mode near the horizon is referred to as a _",
    "firewall_. it is also stressed that the real execution of the measurement is not needed for firewalls @xcite@xcite . in the argument",
    ", the existence of almost maximal entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is essential .",
    "because the reduced density operator of @xmath3 becomes an almost maximally entropic state,@xmath12   \\sim\\frac { 1}{n_{l}}\\sum_{i}|i\\rangle_{l}\\langle i|_{l}=\\frac{1}{n_{l}}\\mathbf{i}_{l}\\ ] ] it is concluded that typical states with firewall singularity are dominant in the calculation of expectation values of the particle number and the energy momentum tensor .",
    "let us imagine alice in a free - fall motion tries to get across the horizon .",
    "then , irrespective of whether the firewall observation requires a measurement of @xmath2 , she will encounter the firewall with near certainty before she passes over the horizon and burns out , as long as amps s argument is correct .",
    "this firewall scenario is completely different from the complementarity scenario @xcite , in which alice is able to safely traverse the horizon .",
    "exactly as in ref .",
    "@xcite , amps also restate this firewall conjecture from an information theoretical point of view .",
    "let @xmath13 be the early radiation modes ; @xmath14 , the late radiation modes ; and @xmath15 , the modes inside the horizon .",
    "amps argue that the strong subadditivity relation of the entropy @xcite,@xmath16 is violated unless a free - falling observer burns out by the firewall .",
    "they say that the absence of tragic drama implies @xmath17 and so @xmath18 . because @xmath19 is guaranteed by the thermality of @xmath14 , @xmath20 is derived from eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in fact",
    ", the black hole loses its entropy and @xmath21 holds .",
    "therefore , they conclude that the no - firewall assumption is wrong . besides , since @xmath13 and @xmath14 are almost maximally entangled with each other in a typical state by the same philosophy of page curve @xcite , @xmath14 is purified by a subsystem of @xmath13 , which is denoted by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "thus it seems that @xmath14 and @xmath22 are in a pure entangled state .",
    "this implies @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the typical - state argument and strong additivity among @xmath26 and @xmath15 derive @xmath27 . because @xmath28 is mutual information of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath28 is non - negative .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath29 .",
    "however , the no - drama condition implies @xmath30 and seems to contradict the typical - state result .",
    "only a very short while after this paradox was raised last year , there have already been numerous efforts @xcite to resolve it by direct attacks to the gravitational system .",
    "however , the answer remains elusive because we are yet to arrive at a quantum gravity theory . in this paper , a different strategy is taken against the paradox .",
    "we analyze not the gravitational system but instead a moving mirror model of a free massless scalar field as one of the best quantum systems to test the validity of amps s reasoning about the firewall it is well known that moving mirrors reproduce emission of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the system is very simple and completely unitary . in accordance with the reeh",
    " schlieder theorem @xcite , @xmath3 is fully entangled with @xmath2 .",
    "based on the theorem , it can be argued that any state of @xmath3 can be arbitrarily reproduced closely by operating a polynomial of local @xmath2 operators on the final state of scattering with the mirror .",
    "owing to the finiteness of the hilbert space dimensions , this means that we can construct a local measurement operator of @xmath2 @xcite that yields an arbitrary post - measurement state of @xmath3 .",
    "though the amps assumptions seem satisfied on first glance , it is noticed that no firewall appears with deadly huge average energy flux in the moving mirror model , because the average values of energy - momentum tensor are finite everywhere . as argued in section 3 , the reason of no firewalls is that the continuum limit using regularization with poincar and conformal invariances modifies the uv entanglement structure of typical states to generate a low - energy effective field theory .",
    "therefore , the maximal entanglement condition assumed by amps is not sustained in this limit .",
    "it seems very plausible that this modification of the entanglement structure in the continuum limit may also occur for the entanglement of @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the gravitational system to avoid the original amps paradox . in this paper",
    ", it is also argued that the strong subadditivity argument of amps has a serious flaw from a viewpoint of locality .",
    "our results suggest that page curve argument is not able to be applied precisely to black hole evaporation .",
    "originally , the argument is based on appearance of almost maximum entanglement in typical - state models with huge degeneracy and small interaction @xcite .",
    "the models are proposed just for exploring foundation of statistical mechanics in macroscopic systems which consist of a huge number of the same - energy components interacting with each other via very small coupling constants .",
    "however , many interacting systems like ordinary ( uniformly distributed ) spin networks with finite dimensions do not satisfy this condition .",
    "the number density of states usually increases very fast as energy increases .",
    "thus the energy of `` typical states '' in the hilbert space is of almost the same order of the maximum energy of the system .",
    "if we ignore the low - energy - state contribution , the standard analyses @xcite mean that two large complementary subsystems have almost maximum entanglement in a typical state with typical energy , though the energy is very high .",
    "therefore , entanglement entropy between the subsystems is proportional to volume of the smaller subsystem if the subsystems are uniformly distributed .",
    "this is actually a volume law of entanglement entropy , not an area law . as opposed to the typical states with typical high energy , it is well known that low - energy states near the ground state obey area laws of entanglement entropy @xcite@xcite . note that , even in quantum field theory , entanglement entropy of the vacuum state and low - energy states also obeys the ( approximated ) area law , not the volume law @xcite .",
    "this may imply that the almost maximum entanglement can not be attained in ordinary low - energy states of quantum fields .",
    "hence , in the context of firewall arguements , it is naturally expected that the description of low - energy field theory does not allow the almost maximum entanglement between two complemetary subsystems .",
    "thus the page curve picture may be inappropriate in cases with initial low - energy states , which are prepared by some physical selection rule like @xcite .",
    "although we do not have any firewall with nonzero expectation values of firewall particle number , an extended firewall paradox inevitably arises in this model when a general measurement of @xmath2 is performed , as shown in section 4 .",
    "( the similar paradox appears in a more simple case of rindler horizon . )",
    "however , we prove that the measurement does not make the firewall emerge , provided the energy cost of the @xmath2 measurement , which outputs information about @xmath3 , is much smaller than the ultraviolet cutoff scale . in the black hole system , a similar paradox may arise , but too much measurement energy induces a large back reaction to spacetime and may cause formation of a new black hole in the measurement region and enclose the measurement device within the event horizon before it outputs results .",
    "thus a conjecture , firewall information censorship ( fic ) , can be proposed whereby information about encounters with firewalls is never exposed to our low - energy world .",
    "this is a conjecture similar to that of extreme cosmic censorship ( ecc ) @xcite , which selects out regular initial states to avoid firewalls .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that ecc does not prohibit the firewall emergence when we perform general @xmath2 measurements . in this paper , it is also argued that vacuum fluctuation is fully entangled with the late radiation modes @xmath14 and the interior modes @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 without generating the firewall , and it avoids the violation of strong subadditivity in eq .",

    "@xmath96 is the entangled partner of @xmath97 and purifies the total system in this model .",

    "if we have a mode excitation of @xmath89 at the future null infinity , depicted as the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the mode is strongly blueshifted before scattering with the mirror and returns in time to a region defined by @xmath101 at the past null infinity , as shown by the short - interval wave curve in fig .",
    "the severe blueshift occurs because the width of the past subsystem @xmath102 is much smaller than that of the future subsystem @xmath89 : @xmath103     and @xmath3 . ]",
    "this classical blueshift property plays an essential role in the paradox .",
    "note that any entanglement is conserved in time because the modes are simply stretched during the reflection by the mirror .",
    "thus , we can always analyze entanglement at a future time by using the past entanglement .",
    "based on this fact , it can be argued that a late - mode subsystem @xmath3 , which is a composite system of @xmath14 and @xmath96 , is fully entangled with an early - mode subsystem @xmath2 composed of @xmath87 and @xmath13 .",
    "as opposed to amps , it should be stressed that @xmath3 includes the future zero - point fluctuation after the mirror stops and that @xmath2 includes the past zero - point fluctuation before the mirror moves .  in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , a subsystem  @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) at the past null infinity time evolves to @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "if the modes are regularized in terms of the unruh modes with frequency cutoff @xmath114 and particle number cutoff @xmath115 , it is directly verified that @xmath51 is indeed an almost maximally entangled state between @xmath105 and @xmath104 when we consider a large @xmath108 : @xmath116 therefore , in this regularization , @xmath117can be regarded as a typically entangled state in the context of references @xcite .",
    "of course , the same is true for @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the future null infinity .",
    "thus this model satisfies the entanglement condition of reference @xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasized here that no firewalls with divergent expectation values of the energy  momentum tensor appear in the model .",
    "in fact , the expectation value of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor is finite everywhere .",
    "why does the firewall disappear ?",
    "the reasons are explained in the next section .",
    "the regularization , which is adopted in the previous section , satisfies neither special relativistic invariance nor conformal invariance . in particular",
    ", it does not satisfy transitional invariance under @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , the state of the border region between @xmath105 and @xmath104 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) becomes singular when we consider @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this implies that the regularization does not allow a continuum limit to a low - energy field theory . if we adopt any other regularization that maintains the conformal invariance , the superficial @xmath108 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) is eliminated .",
    "more precisely , the unruh representation of @xmath51 is given by : @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are creation operators of the rindler particles satisfying @xmath124   = \\left [   \\tilde{b}_{\\omega_{1}},~\\tilde { b}_{\\omega_{2}}^{\\dag}\\right ]   = \\delta\\left (   \\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}\\right ) $ ] , and @xmath125 is the rindler vacuum state defined by @xmath126 . by changing variables as @xmath127",

    "thus the continuum limit using regularization with the invariances modifies the uv entanglement structure of typical states to generate a low - energy effective field theory .",
    "therefore , the maximal entanglement condition assumed by amps is not sustained in this limit .",
    "this is the most fundamental reason why amps s firewalls do not appear in the moving mirror model @xcite .",
    "it seems very plausible that this modification of the entanglement structure in the continuum limit may also occur for the entanglement of @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the gravitational system to avoid the original amps paradox .",
    "the reason for no firewalls can be also understood from a viewpoint of entanglement . in the amps arguement",
    ", it is assumed that quantum state of the composite system is a typical pure state at a given time , in which a small subsystem is almost maximally entangled with its complement subsystem .",
    "this implies that entanglement entropy between them is proportional to volume of the small subsystem .",
    "the entanglement history of black hole evaporation are precisely imprinted into a sequence from early radiation to late radiation in future null infinity region .",
    "thus very early radiation should be almost maximally entangled with other radiation .",
    "however , the radiation is described by a low - energy field theory .",
    "note that , in such a low - energy theory , the entanglement entropy between a subsystem and its complement is proportional to the boundary area , not the volume of the subsystem @xcite .",
    "therefore , as opposed to a naive expectation , the quantum state is not an almost maximally entangled state .",
    "that is , the state is not a typical one .",
    "actually it is selected so as to satisfy natural conditions of the symmetries of field theory and small excitation energy in the continuum limit .",
    "this fact clarifies that the page curve argument @xcite , which is based on the typical state assumption , is also incorrect as long as the description of low - energy field theory is reproduced in null future infinity .",
    "next , we explain how the entropic paradox of firewalls related to eq .",
