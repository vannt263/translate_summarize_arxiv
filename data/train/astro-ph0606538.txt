    "the results of _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ have made an inestimable impact on the science of cosmology , highlighted by the very recent release of the three year data : maps , power spectra , and consequent cosmological analysis .",
    "precisely because these results play so prominent a role , it is important to check and recheck their consistency .",
    "recently @xcite reanalyzed the  three year temperature sky maps , and noted two discrepancies in the  power spectrum analysis . on large angular scales",
    "there is a small power excess in the _ wmap _ spectrum ( 510% at @xmath11 ) , primarily due to a problem with the likelihood approximation used by the _ wmap _ team . on small angular scales ,",
    "an unexplained systematic difference between the v- and w - band spectra ( few percent at @xmath12 ) was found . in this letter",
    ", we suggest this second discrepancy is at least partially due to an excessive point source correction in the  power spectrum .",
    "the _ wmap _ temperature data are provided as ten sky maps observed at five frequencies between 23 and 94 ghz , pixelized using the healpix scheme with 3 million ( @xmath13 7-size ) pixels per map . here we consider the q - band ( 41 ghz ) , v - band ( 61 ghz ) , and w - band ( 94 ghz ) channels since these have the least galactic foreground contamination , but only v- and w - bands for the cosmological parameter analysis .",
    "we account for the ( assumed circularly symmetric ) beam profile of each channel independently , adopting the kp2 sky cut as our mask .",
    "this excludes 15.3% of the sky including all resolved point sources .",
    "to deal with contamination outside the mask , we simply use the foreground template corrected maps provided on the lambda website .",
    "the noise is modeled as uncorrelated , non - uniform , and gaussian with an rms given by @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the noise per observation for channel @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the number of observations in pixel @xmath18 .",
    "we estimate power spectra with the pseudo-@xmath19 master method @xcite , which decouples the mode correlations in a noise - corrected raw quadratic estimate of the power spectrum computed on the partial sky .",
    "following @xcite , we include only cross - correlations between channels in our power spectrum estimates .    considering each of three years , three bands , and the number of differencing assemblies per band ( two for q-/v- and four for w - band ) , 276 individual cross - spectra are available for analysis .",
    "each of these is computed to @xmath20 .",
    "the v- and w - band spectra have been verified against spectra provided by the wmap team , but the q - band spectra ( computed the same way ) were not available for comparison .",
    "for the point source amplitude analysis , we bin the power spectra into ten bins ( @xmath21@xmath22 , @xmath23@xmath24 ,  , @xmath25@xmath26 ) in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and decrease the number of bins ( and thus the computation time ) .",
    "the corresponding error bars are computed using a fisher approximation and similarly binned .      for our main result , we marginalize over the cmb power and estimate a single amplitude for the point source spectrum by the method we discuss below .",
    "we also compute the amplitude in @xmath4-bins , but for brevity omit the details , which are similar .",
    "we model the ensemble averaged cross - spectra as the sum of the two components , @xmath27 , showing explicitly the contribution from each part of the signal . here the multipole bin is denoted by @xmath28 and the cross - correlation pair by @xmath29 ( w1yr1)(w2yr3 ) , ( q1yr2)(v1yr2 ) , _ etc . _",
    "no auto - power spectra are included , so noise subtraction is unnecessary .",
    "we marginalize over the cmb spectrum , which we denote by @xmath30 .",
    "the window functions for each differencing assembly pair are @xmath31 , which we later consider in terms of a matrix .",
    "the contribution to a cross - spectrum from the cmb signal is thus @xmath32 ( in thermodynamic temperature units ) .",
    "the spectra in this application are already beam - deconvolved , so the window functions @xmath33 are trivial .",
    "we denote the amplitude of the unresolved point source power spectrum by @xmath34 .",
    "this amplitude relates to the cross - spectra via the frequency and shape dependence vector @xmath35 , @xmath36 here the cross - spectrum @xmath37 has channels at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the units of @xmath34 are antenna temperature squared times solid angle and the function @xmath41 converts from antenna temperature to thermodynamic temperature .",
    "thus , we assume that the radio sources are spatially uncorrelated ( and therefore have a white noise spectrum ) and have a power - law frequency dependence using antenna temperature units .",
    "note that well - resolved point sources have already been masked from the maps before the evaluation of the cross - spectra , and @xmath34 therefore represents unresolved sources only .",
    "however , we may only directly measure the frequency dependence for the resolved sources .",
    "for these , @xcite found @xmath42 , and following we take the same even for the unresolved sources .",
    "we choose @xmath43 ghz ( q - band ) as our reference frequency .",
    "we organize the binned cross - spectra @xmath44 into a data vector @xmath45 .",
    "we use a gaussian model for the likelihood @xmath46 of the power spectrum , appropriate at high @xmath4 : @xmath47\\t \\sgi \\left [ \\d -   \\langle \\d \\rangle \\right ] ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] where the covariance @xmath48 can be written as @xmath49 . here",
    "we assume the covariance is diagonal both in multipole and cross - spectrum .",
    "an appendix of @xcite derives an unbiased estimator for this type of problem , generalizing the point source treatment of @xcite . here",
    "the estimators are equivalent , and result in a linear estimate for @xmath34 , denoted @xmath50 , and its covariance @xmath51 : @xmath52 where we have defined the auxiliary matrix @xmath53 in this notation , we consider @xmath54 and @xmath55 as column vectors with a single index @xmath56 , and @xmath57 as a matrix with indices @xmath56 and @xmath58 . matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 have indices @xmath56 and @xmath61 .",
    "this estimator marginalizes out the cmb , a conservative treatment which assumes nothing but the frequency dependence . to compute the amplitude in bins ,",
    "we redefine @xmath34 as @xmath62 , a vector of the amplitudes , with @xmath63 , modifying @xmath55 for each component to lend power only to appropriate multipole bins .",
    "using the method described in the previous section , we find a point source amplitude of @xmath0 @xmath1k@xmath2 sr , significantly less than the  value of @xmath64 @xmath1k@xmath2 sr . computing the spectrum in bins ( figure [ fig : source_powspec ] ) , we see that the source power spectrum is best measured at @xmath65 . to evaluate goodness - of - fit ,",
    "we compute @xmath66 for 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "all of the discrepancy in our fit arises from a single high bin at @xmath67@xmath24 , which has @xmath68 .",
    "this bin is so different that we suspect that it is not detecting point source power alone , but perhaps some residual foreground .",
    "we leave a rigorous investigation of this anomalous bin to later work , leaving it in our analysis here . if we were to exclude it , the other nine bins are consistent with a flat power spectrum at @xmath69 @xmath1k@xmath2 sr  with @xmath70 for 8 remaining degrees of freedom  though they would prefer a somewhat smaller value for @xmath34 . for the  amplitude",
    ", we measure @xmath71 for 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "this large discrepancy is puzzling because our method should be equivalent to the  method .",
    "the net effect of the lower unresolved point source amplitude on the co - added  cmb power spectrum may be computed in terms of a weighted average of corrections for individual cross - spectra ( v@xmath72v , v@xmath72w , and w@xmath72w , respectively ) . following the construction of s spectrum , for @xmath73 the correction is given by a uniform average over the 137 individual cross - spectrum corrections ; for @xmath74 it is given as an inverse noise weighted average .",
    "in this letter we approximate the latter with the inverse variance of the power spectrum coefficients computed from 2500 simulations for each cross - spectrum individually , but do not account for correlations between different cross - spectra .",
    "the net power spectrum correction is shown in figure [ fig : spec_corr ] .",
    "we show the q - band spectra , corrected by each point source amplitude , in the top panel of figure [ fig : powspec ] , and compare the v- and w - band spectra in the bottom panel .",
    "one of two issues pointed out by @xcite was a discrepancy between the v- and w - bands at @xmath75 significant at about @xmath76 .",
    "this is seen by comparing the two red curves in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : powspec ] . however , applying the lower point source correction raises the v - band spectrum by 10@xmath77 in this range but the w - band by only a few @xmath78 .",
    "effectively , about @xmath79 of the previous @xmath80 average difference is thus removed , reducing the significance of the difference from 3 to @xmath81 , compared to 2500 simulations .",
    "a small difference is still present , and may warrant further investigation , but is no longer striking .",
    "this gives us confidence that our point source correction is the more consistent than the  value .      to assess the impact of this new high-@xmath4 correction on cosmological parameters , we repeat the analysis described by @xcite using the cosmomc package ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which also gives the parameter definitions ) and a modified version of the  likelihood code .",
    "first , at @xmath82 the  likelihood is replaced with a blackwell - rao gibbs sampling - based estimator @xcite , and second , the bias correction shown in figure [ fig : spec_corr ] is added to the co - added  spectrum .",
    "the results from these computations are summarized in table [ tab : parameters ] .    as reported by @xcite , the most notable effect of the low-@xmath4 estimator bias in the  data release was a @xmath83 shift in @xmath6 to lower values , increasing the nominal significance of @xmath8 . in table",
    "[ tab : parameters ] we see that the over - estimated point source amplitude causes a similar effect by lowering the high-@xmath4 spectrum too much . correcting for both of these effects ,",
    "the spectral index is @xmath84 for the combination of _ wmap _ , boomerang @xcite and acbar @xcite data , or different from unity by only @xmath85 .",
    "the marginalized distributions both with and without these corrections are shown in figure [ fig : n_s ] .",
    "the other cosmological parameters change little . for reference ,",
    "the best - fit ( as opposed to marginalized ) parameters for this case are @xmath86 .",
    "using a combination of cross - spectra of maps from the q- , v- , and w - bands of  three year data , we fit for the amplitude of the power spectrum of unresolved point sources in q - band , finding @xmath87 @xmath1k@xmath2 sr .",
    "this fit has significantly less power than the fit used to correct the  final co - added power spectrum used for cosmological analysis .",
    "we compute and apply the proper point source correction , noting the corrected v- and w - bands are more consistent than before .",
    "the improper point source correction conspires with a low-@xmath4 estimator bias to impart a spurious tilt to the  temperature power spectrum . with the revised corrections",
    ", we find evidence for spectral index @xmath88 at only @xmath89 , while other parameters remain largely unchanged .",
