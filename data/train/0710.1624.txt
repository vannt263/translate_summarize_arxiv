    "quantum computation provides a fundamentally new way to process data ; as a theory , it is complete and remarkably rich @xcite .",
    "however , any real quantum computer is subject to an implacable physical reality : components of a computer will always be faulty due to environmental noise . hence , the builder of a quantum computer faces the conundrum of having to isolate the device from its surroundings and , simultaneously , of needing to act on it and read its output @xcite .",
    "many strategies have been devised to address this problem @xcite , the most general being quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "quantum error correction ( qec ) should be understood as a perturbative approach @xcite , where one can estimate the probability of having an `` error '' in the wave function of the quantum computer after a certain time .",
    "it is naturally formulated as a perturbation expansion in powers of the coupling between the computer and the environment @xcite .",
    "qec can not , in general , perfectly correct the quantum evolution , and the interference of the amplitudes for the various processes that occur implies that quantum information is always lost to the environment @xcite .",
    "however , as we discuss below , qec can very effectively slow down this loss .",
    "in fact , a central theoretical result is the `` threshold theorem '' : it states that if the error probability is smaller than a critical value , quantum computation can be sustained indefinitely @xcite .",
    "the word `` indefinitely '' deserves some clarification : for the problems that we discuss , it means that given a calculation and a desired precision , it is always possible to construct a quantum circuit that will provide the correct result with high enough probability .",
    "qec has been largely developed using phenomenological `` error models '' .",
    "rarely is a connection to a microscopic quantum dynamical system found in the literature ( see , however , refs .",
    "in contrast , here we pursue exactly such a connection : we discuss the formal steps needed to link the theory of error correction with microscopic hamiltonian models .",
    "furthermore , because of the perturbative nature of the method , it is possible to draw a close parallel between the `` threshold theorem '' and the theory of quantum phase transitions . we find that if a certain inequality holds , an error threshold always exists . when the inequality is not satisfied , either a new version of the threshold criterion is required or fault tolerant quantum computation is not possible at all . for the moment , we are not able to distinguish between these two possibilities .    our analysis is based on the following assumptions .",
    "first and foremost , we assume that it is possible to perform the building blocks of quantum error correction , namely , preparation of states , quantum gates , and measurements .",
    "second , we consider that the environment is described by a free field theory in which thermal fluctuations can be effectively suppressed . finally , the main simplifying assumption of our discussion is that the qubits are sufficiently separated in space for an entire error correction procedure to be performed before correlations between nearby qubits develop .",
    "the probability of an error in an individual qubit within a qec cycle is , therefore , independent of all other qubits .",
    "this does not imply that there are no spatial correlations ; rather , they develop on longer time scales , while the error correction procedure is done faster than a certain characteristic time .",
    "we emphasize that this hypothesis is not a limitation of the general theoretical framework that we describe , but simply a way to connect to the traditional proofs of the `` threshold theorem '' in terms of stochastic error models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "because of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject , this introduction continues with a discussion of two points .",
    "first , the difficulties in taking into account correlations in the environment are explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - problem - of ] from a perturbative point of view .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : qec ] , we discuss the qec method from a physics viewpoint and present some results for the standard stochastic error model .",
    "we start the body of the paper by developing the relation between error models and quantum codes ( sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] ) . the key issue of qec in a correlated environment is treated in sec .",
    "[ sub : qec - and - perturbation ] .",
    "our main results delineating when the perturbative treatment is valid appear in sec .",
    "[ sec : hypercube ] .",
    "at the end of this section , we provide a brief comparison between our results and those of ref .  .",
    "[ sec : qpt ] discusses parallels between the threshold theorem of qec and the theory of quantum phase transitions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and comment on some open problems .",
    "in order to set the stage for the analysis in the presence of qec , we first look at the problem of errors created by a correlated environment in an unprotected system . in the schrdinger equation governing the time evolution of a quantum system , the hamiltonian @xmath0 can usually be separated into a single - particle term @xmath1 and a many - particle interaction part @xmath2 .",
    "a formal solution of this equation is given by the dyson series in the interaction picture .",
    "solution by iteration shows that the time evolution operator is @xmath3 with @xmath4 denoting the time ordering operator and @xmath5 . if @xmath2 represents the interaction between the quantum computer and its surroundings , each insertion of @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol - int-1 ] ) corresponds to an `` error '' in the computer evolution .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ eq : evol - int-1 ] ) provides the natural framework to study the effects of the environment on the state of the quantum computer .",
    "it is always possible to give an upper bound to the `` error probability '' @xcite .",
    "the reason is that dyson s series is absolutely convergent for finite times and bounded operators ( see appendix [ sec : absolute - convergence ] ) . in short ,",
    "the bounding is done by defining the `` sup '' operator norm and the evolution operator with at least one `` error '' ( one insertion of @xmath2 ) , @xmath6 the norm of @xmath7 is related to the probability of having errors in the computer .",
    "the calculation is simple and yields @xmath8 where we used the triangular inequality , the unitarity of @xmath9 , and defined @xmath10 as the largest eigenvalue of @xmath2 ( with corresponding eigenvector @xmath11 ) .",
    "one can understand this bound as simply a restatement of @xmath12 , as follows : @xmath13 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 \\left [ 1-t_{t }   \\cos\\frac{1}{\\hbar } \\int_{0}^{t } dt^{\\prime } v ( t^{\\prime } ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath14 the norm @xmath15 has been very useful in problems involving non - markovian noise @xcite . however , in qec , an analysis based on the bound eq .",
    "( [ eq : fbound ] ) only makes sense when @xmath16 , while we are concerned with the long time limit , @xmath17 , for which this bound on the norm of the error diverges . in this case ,",
    "dyson s series is only asymptotically convergent and the `` sup '' norm is of no practical use .",
    "hence , it is important to express the error probability differently .",
    "we must go back full circle and reexamine the dyson series for the time evolution of a particular state , instead of the worst case scenario explored by the `` sup '' norm approach .",
    "henceforth , we will be mainly interested in an interaction hamiltonian with the general form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a coupling constant , @xmath20 is the size of the system , and @xmath21 is some function of the degrees of freedom of a free theory whose hamiltonian is @xmath1 . because we are interested in correlated non - markovian noise , we assume that the free fields are such that the asymptotic expression for the two - point correlation function is a power law , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and latexmath:[$\\delta t =    of @xmath21 , @xmath25 is the so - called dynamical exponent , and @xmath26 is a fixed eigenstate of @xmath1 ( which we will usually take to be the ground state of the environment ) .    the motivation for developing a perturbative expansion of the evolution operator ( the dyson series in the interaction picture ) is the hope that a few terms in the series or a summable family of them will capture most of the physics .",
    "it is then assumed that small coupling can guarantee fast convergence .",
    "however , since @xmath27 is not necessarily small , the number of terms that contribute substantially to the series can grow faster that the smallness of consecutive terms . in order to see that ,",
    "let us calculate the probability of an evolution with errors using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdagf ] ) , @xmath28",
    "\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] since we are assuming a non - interacting free hamiltonian , we can use wick s theorem .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that there is at least one term at each order @xmath29 in the series that contributes `` extensively '' as @xmath30 .",
    "a simple example is given by the series of `` bubble '' diagrams , where the @xmath31 order term is given by the contractions @xmath32 disregarding numerical prefactors unimportant for our discussion , we sum the series as a geometric progression to obtain @xmath33 therefore , for @xmath34 there is no guarantee that the perturbation series converges .",
    "conversely , if @xmath35 , higher - order terms in the series should be increasingly less important .",
    "thus , for @xmath34 the probability of an evolution with `` errors '' tends to one , whereas for @xmath35 it will depend only on the `` non - extensive '' terms in the series .",
    "the same analysis can be immediately transported to the study of the fidelity @xmath36 , where we see that for a relevant perturbation , @xmath34 , the overlap between the initial state and the evolving wave function tends to zero ( an orthogonality catastrophe ) .",
    "this sort of `` infrared '' problem provides a contact point with the theory of quantum phase transitions , where the same kind of considerations also appear when calculating the partition function using the imaginary time formalism ( see appendix [ sec : perturbative - expansion - in ] ) .    in the body of this paper ,",
    "our main goal is to transfer these ideas of relevance and irrelevance of a perturbation to the evolution of a quantum computer protected by qec .",
    "quantum error correction is arguably the most versatile method to protect quantum information from decoherence @xcite .",
    "it is a clever use of two features of quantum mechanics : entanglement and ( in its traditional form ) wave packet reduction due to measurement .",
    "thus , before we start our discussion of qec , it is important to carefully define what we mean by entanglement and decoherence .",
    "an entangled state of two quantum systems is a state that can not be described as a direct tensor product of states of individual systems or probabilistic mixtures of tensor - product states .",
    "as an example , consider two physical qubits ( hereafter referred to by the subscripts @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "each qubit has a hilbert space isomorphic to a complex projective plane of dimension one , @xmath39 ( see appendix [ sec : hilbert ] for details ) .",
    "however , the combined hilbert space is not isomorphic to @xmath40 , but to the much larger @xmath41 .",
    "all states in @xmath41 outside @xmath42 are said to be entangled .",
    "an important subtlety is the implicit notion of a preferred `` basis '' .",
    "although we can choose from an infinite number of @xmath43 subspaces inside the same @xmath41 , nature gives us a natural choice , namely , @xmath44 .    in the working of a quantum computer",
    ", entanglement has two opposite roles .",
    "on the one hand , entanglement between qubits is the key element in a quantum computation that distinguishes it from its classical counterpart @xcite . on the other hand , when the computer and the environment become entangled , precious quantum information is lost .",
    "usually , the latter effect is referred to as decoherence . in the literature",
    ", there are two different definitions of decoherence . in a strict sense",
    ", decoherence is the decay in time of the coherences ( off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix ) , while dissipation involves the exchange of energy with the environment and changes in populations ( the diagonal terms of the density matrix ) .",
    "however , the word `` decoherence '' is also used in a broader sense involving changes in both diagonal and off - diagonal entries of the density matrix . in this paper",
    "we choose the latter use of the word .",
    "the reason is that from a quantum error correction perspective changes in diagonal and off - diagonal entries are `` dual '' to each other @xcite .",
    "there is a simple heuristic explanation for error correction : usually , noise is regarded as a local phenomenon , thus its damaging effect in the computer should be less pronounced if the information is delocalized among several qubits .",
    "this is precisely how classical error correction codes work .",
    "a simple example of the latter is a majority vote , where the information of a bit is copied into three physical bits , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if the probability of an error in a given qubit is @xmath47 , the probability of having two independent errors , and consequently a total information loss , is @xmath48 .",
    "thus encoding increases the level of protection of the information .",
    "it is tempting to start explaining qec from this perspective .",
    "however , the no - cloning theorem @xcite states that it is impossible to copy an unknown quantum state .",
    "the alternative approach is to use an entangled state involving two or more qubits to store the quantum information .",
    "this clearly delocalizes the information , but it is at odds with the intuitive notion that entangled states are in general more fragile to the effects of the environment ( this intuition is driven by the quantum - to - classical transition due to decoherence , see appendix [ sec : sb - decoherence ] for a concrete example ) .",
    "thus , delocalizing the information using entanglement does not alone solve the problem .",
    "it is possible to use unitary operations to transfer the entanglement between the qubits and the environment to a constant fresh supply of ancilla qubits @xcite .",
    "however , it is more traditional in qec to use the partial measurements of _ some _ ancilla qubits to reduce the quantum interference with the environment @xcite .",
    "measurements here have to be understood as the projection of the state of one of the qubits ( an ancilla ) onto a certain basis or reference state .",
    "the outcome of this projection is a classical bit ( `` zero '' or `` one '' ) and is called a syndrome .",
    "the partial wave packet reductions caused by syndrome extraction steer the long - time evolution of the quantum computer .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the duration of the measurement is not fundamental to the qec procedure @xcite .",
    "in fact , this process can be quite long without jeopardizing the method .",
    ", is encoded by two controlled - not ( cnot ) gates , @xmath49 , into an entangled state @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "after some time , it is decoded by a second pair of cnot gates .",
    "an error in @xmath53 is identified by measuring the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( rectangle ) .",
    "the qec cycle ends with the correction of a possible phase - flip ( arrow).,width=264 ]    a simple example illustrates how qec works @xcite .",
    "suppose that we have an error model consisting of independent baths for each qubit which can cause only phase errors , and an initial qubit in the state @xmath56 that we want to protect .",
    "the 3-qubit code provides the simplest error correction procedure for this problem . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3-qubit - code ] , we define the encoding / decoding methods in a qec cycle . at the end of a cycle , the probability of measuring the syndrome of a phase flip error in one of the three physical qubits is @xcite @xmath57 and the probability of the syndrome indicating no error in the logical qubit is @xmath58 the residual decoherence that can _ not _ be corrected by the qec procedure is closely related to these probabilities . in the case of a cycle",
    "in which the syndrome indicates that one error occurred in any of the physical qubits , dephasing of the logical qubit is given by the reduction of the off - diagonal density matrix element @xcite , @xmath59 while for a cycle with a syndrome indicating no error , the dephasing is weaker , @xmath60 after @xmath61 of these cycles , the probability of having @xmath29 uncorrelated errors is @xmath62 with an associated residual decoherence of @xmath63 an elegant visualization of these events is given by a `` syndrome history diagram '' of fig .",
    "[ fig : fault - path ] ( see for instance ref .   for a similar discussion ) .",
    "an ordered set of syndromes labels a particular evolution of the logical qubit . from the syndrome history one can find the most likely evolution and the associated residual decoherence . for our 3-qubit code example , the most likely evolution is given by the mean value of @xmath29 , @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the residual decoherence of the logical qubit is given by @xmath65 therefore , as long the number of qec cycles @xmath66 , the probability of measuring the correct initial state of the logical qubit is very high .",
    "we can quantify the amount of information that is lost by calculating the von neumann entropy @xmath67 : @xmath68   \\quad\\;\\\\   \\lim_{n\\gg\\epsilon^{-2}}s & \\approx   & - |\\alpha|^{2 } \\ln |\\alpha|^{2}- |\\beta|^{2 } \\ln |\\beta|^{2 } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the loss of information can be substantial if the number of cycles is so large that @xmath69 .     and",
    "@xmath70 , respectively .",
    "a path provides the history of the logical qubit and is recorded as a sequence of syndromes.,width=226 ]    if the information needs to be protected for a long period of time , we have to modify the protection scheme .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to consider a concatenated circuit where each qubit in fig .",
    "[ fig:3-qubit - code ] is a logical qubit itself and each gate is a logical gate , resulting in an effective reduction of @xmath71 .",
    "layers and layers of protection can be added as needed @xcite . a chief concern when applying",
    "this approach is whether the steps required in the addition of more qubits and operations do not actually increase the chance of errors ( since they increase the combinatorial factors in the probability distribution ) .",
    "this question is addressed by fault - tolerant quantum computation theory @xcite , which has as its main result the so - called threshold theorem : if the `` noise strength '' @xmath47 is smaller than a certain critical value , then the introduction of an additional layer of concatenation improves the protection of the information .",
    "a key ingredient in the derivation of the noise threshold is the assumption that a probabilistic structure similar to the one that we outlined above exists .",
    "here rests the main concern of this paper .",
    "there are many physical situations where an environment can induce strong memory effects and spatial correlations among qubits .",
    "hence , it may not be obvious how to define the `` error probabilities '' of a qubit .",
    "this hinders the traditional theory of qec and threshold analysis , thus motivating a careful study of the dynamics of quantum computers protected by qec .",
    "the syndrome history used to describe the logical qubit history can be converted into a more formal description of the computer dynamics . in our discussion , we will assume an environment , @xmath1 , described by a free field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath10 , a characteristic wave velocity @xmath72 , and a dynamical exponent @xmath25 .",
    "although simple , a free field theory faithfully represents many physically relevant environments : the electromagnetic field , a phonon field , spin waves , a bosonic bath , or , more generally , any two - body direct interactions between qubits that was split by a hubbard - stratanovich field . in addition , we include in the hamiltonian a term to account for the sequence of quantum gates performed on the qubits , @xmath73 .",
    "hence , the total hamiltonian is @xmath74 the interaction term will be assumed to have the form of a vector coupling between qubits and the environment , @xmath75 where @xmath76 are pauli matrices for the qubit located at @xmath77 , @xmath78 are the coupling strengths , and @xmath79 are functions of the environment operators @xcite . since @xmath80=0 $ ]",
    ", we adopt an interaction picture that follows not only the environment but also the evolution of the computer ( see appendix [ sec : interaction - picture ] ) . in this rotating frame , the evolution operator is @xmath81 the interaction @xmath82 depends on the quantum code and its implementation .",
    "nevertheless , there are two possible ways to keep the discussion code independent :    \\(i ) in our previous work @xcite , we assumed that quantum gates were performed faster than the environment response time ( which is of order the inverse of the ultraviolet cutoff frequency @xmath10 ) .",
    "we call this approximation the `` fast gate '' limit . for this case",
    ", we have the evolution of the computer between gates given by @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "then , when a gate is performed the action on the qubit is instantaneous and the subsequent evolution is once again governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fastgates ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) a second possibility is to derive an upper bound on the effects of correlations . in order to do that",
    ", we must first discuss how slow gates , which are performed over time intervals larger than @xmath85 , change eq .",
    "( [ eq : fastgates ] ) .",
    "then , we can define an effective interaction @xmath86 that takes into account the slowness of the gates and serves as an upper bound to the exact ( and code - dependent ) @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the real experimental situation rests between the two limits ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "before we begin a detailed description of how to handle case ( ii ) , let us note that here the terminology `` fast '' and `` slow '' gates follows the qec literature : fast ( slow ) gates have a duration much shorter ( longer ) than @xmath87 .",
    "however , as will become clear later , the relevant time scale that appears in the study of correlation effects is the period or duration of the error correction cycle , @xmath88 .",
    "thus , in that context , short ( `` fast '' ) or long ( `` slow '' ) dynamical effects will be naturally defined with respect to @xmath88 , and not to @xmath87 .",
    "any quantum computer code is just a rotation in the hilbert space of the qubits and can be described as a trajectory on @xmath89 , where @xmath61 is the total number of qubits . in the schrdinger picture ,",
    "the evolution is given by the natural action on @xmath90 by @xmath91 .",
    "the most general fault - tolerant quantum circuit is therefore defined by the hamiltonian @xmath92 , where @xmath93 are the generators of the lie algebra of @xmath91 .",
    "the evolution operator associated with this hamiltonian satisfies the integral equation @xmath94 such that the computer state vector at time @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 represents the initial state of the computer .",

    "( [ eq : bigg ] ) is general , it is not very instructive .",
    "furthermore , it is very undesirable from an error correction standpoint : since @xmath102 is an arbitrary matrix of @xmath91 , the @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bigg ] ) in principle generates a highly complex correlated error that is nevertheless first order in the coupling to the environment . the problem with the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bigg ] ) is that it is too general since we assumed that arbitrary rotations are performed at each single step .",
    "however , one of the cornerstones of quantum computation is that such general rotations can be approximately decomposed into a series of elementary gates @xcite .",
    "hence , our strategy will be to specialize the calculation to these elementary gates and assume that general rotations can be implemented by a finite series of such gates which are well resolved in time .",
    "when only single - qubit operations are performed , we have @xmath103 in this case , @xmath99 is the product of @xmath104 matrices acting in each qubit s hilbert space .",

    "therefore , the noise operators @xmath112 are unaltered by the rotation .",
    "however , if @xmath118 has a significant weight at frequencies smaller than @xmath10 ( slow gates ) , one must convolve @xmath21 with @xmath118 , yielding a substantially different noise operator .",
    "the general hamiltonian for two - qubit gates is of the form @xmath119 however , one can also generate a full set of gates using instead a single type of interaction , @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are fixed for each gate @xmath123 . in order to see that this is sufficient we can for instance set @xmath124 .",
    "this generates the liquid nmr hamiltonian @xcite , where the ising interaction , eq .",

    "there are six ( interrelated ) green functions in such an expansion : the usual advanced and retarded functions for the time - ordered series ; the advanced and retarded functions for the anti - time - ordered series ; and the lesser and greater functions , which contract a term from the time - ordered series with another one from the anti - time - ordered series .",
    "this formalism is often referred to as the schwinger - keldysh approach @xcite .",

    "the key distinction between the work of akp and ours is the instantaneous nature of their interaction .",
    "hence , while in our work each qubit is inside a distinct hypercube , for akp they are all contained in a single hypercube .",
    "there is however a trade - off .",
    "since their interaction is instantaneous and perfect error correction is assumed , there is no propagation of errors in time through the gauge field of the environment .",

    "( [ eq : scalingequation ] ) holds in the case they analyzed as well .",
    "the main result of fault - tolerant quantum computation is the threshold theorem .",
    "the theorem states that if a stochastic error probability @xmath47 is smaller than a critical value @xmath280 , then the introduction of an additional layer of concatenation improves the protection of the information .",
    "hence , for a fixed @xmath47 , it is possible to sustain a quantum computation for any desire time at the cost of some reasonable additional hardware overhead .    even though quantum computation and qec are out - of - equilibrium problems , it is intuitive to talk about different phases in the computer - environment parameter space . along this line of thought",
    ", each phase corresponds to a distinct steady state .",
    "a natural choice for an order parameter is that given by the entanglement among the qubits and the environment .",
    "we summarize our thinking in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] , where we present a schematic phase diagram for a quantum computer running qec .    for stochastic noise models ,",
    "such an idea was explored by aharonov @xcite . following that work",
    ", we can separate the behavior of the computer into two distinct regimes :    \\(i ) for @xmath281 , the computer components can maintain large entanglement through fault - tolerant procedures , which in turns means that the computer and the environment are weakly entangled .",
    "hence , due to this large internal entanglement , the quantum computer departs from the classical computer model .",
    "we can formalize these remarks by remembering that qec tries to keep the system in the  steady state \" described by the reduced density matrix . in order to keep the notation simple",
    ", lets take the ideal computer state as a pure state , @xmath282 with @xmath283 expressed in terms of the computational basis @xmath284 . as consequence",
    ", it has a reduced entropy @xmath285 . in this case , if we look at the full hilbert space ( that is , before tracing out the environment ) , we find the tensor state @xmath286 ( ii ) for @xmath287 , the computer components are weakly entangled and , therefore , can be efficiently simulated by a turing machine .",
    "in other words , the computer density matrix no longer represents a pure state , but rather a statistical mixture .",
    "thus , the computer components are strongly entangled with the environment .",
    "this corresponds to a steady state with a large reduced entropy ( in the limit of @xmath288 , @xmath289 , with @xmath61 the number of qubits ) .    in such a description , we see that @xmath47 plays a role analogous to an effective temperature @xcite . hence , the threshold theorem defines a phase transition from a high - temperature phase , where qubits are independent from each other , to a low - temperature phase , where quantum coherence and entanglement are possible @xcite .",
    "this also sheds new light on the role of periodic measurements in qec : they can be seen as a refrigeration that extracts entropy from the computer ( very much like the schulman - vazirani initialization procedure @xcite or the transfer of entanglement to fresh ancillas @xcite ) .",
    "if the entropy production in the computer is below a certain level , then the computer can be kept in its `` low - temperature '' phase .",
    "our analysis of correlated noise also fits perfectly into this description . the dimension criterion provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalingequation ] ) is the hallmark of a quantum phase transition @xcite . for @xmath290",

    "the computer and the environment become increasingly entangled and the system is driven towards a different steady state .",
    "such a state is probably distinct from the `` high temperature '' one and it is likely that it is characterized by a smaller residual entropy .",
    "this does not mean that for @xmath291 it would not be possible to perform quantum computation .",
    "it only means that the threshold theorem as we stated it does not hold .",
    "it is conceivable that some different derivation of the theorem exists in this case . in this sense",
    ", @xmath292 defines what is usually referred to as the upper critical dimension of the model ( see appendix [ sec : perturbative - expansion - in ] ) . below the upper critical dimension",
    ", there can be substantial corrections to the steady state given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : freefixedpoint ] ) , but it may still be possible to prove resilience . the question that remains open is whether a lower critical dimension exists , namely , a criterion for @xmath2 that would tell us when it is impossible to perform long - time quantum computation .",
    "most previous discussions of qec have used the quantum master equation and quantum dynamical semi - groups @xcite . this is a very natural approach : the computer is the object of interest ;",
    "hence , one starts the discussion by integrating out the environmental degrees of freedom . however , the price paid in this approach is that some simplification is needed in order to derive the quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "the usual assumption is the born - markov approximation @xcite . in that case , it is natural to define an error probability for a given qubit , and a discussion in terms of error models naturally follows @xcite .",
    "the situation is much less clear when the born - markov approximation can not be justified @xcite . in this case , temporal and spatial correlations can build up and completely destroy the notion of the probability of an error .",
    "a key characteristic of the discussion here is that we do not try to use a quantum master equation .",
    "rather , we follow the approach put forward by schwinger and keldysh @xcite to study out of equilibrium systems .",
    "the main conceptual difference is that we trace the environmental degrees of freedom only at the very last step of the calculation .",
    "hence , we can make the most of the unitary evolution of a quantum mechanical system .",

    "( [ eq : bigf ] ) , can be used to provide an upper bound for the discussion of decoherence . with this effective hamiltonian",
    ", the notation can be unified , and both cases treated simultaneously .",
    "we derived two formal expressions that quantify the evolution of the computer under qec in a correlated environment : ( i ) the probability of a given syndrome history , eq .",

    "( [ eq : rdmlqubit ] ) .    in order to fully use standard qec theory , we introduced the important assumption of `` hypercubes '' , that is a minimum spatial distance between qubits , eq .",
    "( [ xi - def ] ) , in order to allow the definition of an error probability for a single qubit . with this `` hypercube assumption '' ,",
    "it is straightforward to use wick s theorem to separate the environmental modes into intra- and inter - hypercube parts .",
    "the intra - hypercube component defines the error probability , while the inter - hypercube part is tracked by an operator acting on the coarse - grained scale of the hypercubes . as examples",

    "all the pieces are put together when we explicitly calculate the probability of a syndrome history ( sec .",

    "[ sec : residdecohere ] ) .",
    "the main result is cast as a dimensional criterion , eq .",

    "finally , we discuss the parallels between the threshold theorem and a quantum phase transition . a qualitative description of the possible fates of a quantum computer as a function of noise strength and degree of correlation is given in fig .  [ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "there are several clear directions in which our results could be extended or improved .",
    "first , it would obviously be desirable to relax the hypercube assumption introduced in sec.[sec : hypercube ] .",
    "there is nothing intrinsic to our approach which makes this assumption necessary .",
    "yet , progress without it seems much more difficult : the notion of a local error probability during a single qec cycle becomes problematic , making the connection with analysis based on error models , such as the usual derivation of the threshold theorem , unclear .",
    "second , non - instantaneous gate operation is clearly a delicate issue . by using a bound ( sec .",
    "[ sec : upperbounds ] ) , we are able to treat this case in the same way as the fast - gate case . thus we derive an upper bound for the local error probability together with the dimensional criterion .",
    "if a more accurate value for the error probability is desired , a specific error correction code as well as the gates under consideration must be included in the analysis .",
    "however , the scaling argument and resulting dimensional criterion do not , in general , change .    note that it is possible to change the dimensional criterion for the better ( but _ not _ for the worse ) by using the separation of scales introduced by qec .",
    "particular pulse sequences can reduce correlation at long times at the cost of increasing the local error probability .",
    "one example was given in our previous work @xcite .",
    "finally , there may be a regime of parameters where , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] , fault - tolerant quantum computation is possible even though the presently known derivations of the threshold theorem do not apply . by analogy with phase transition phenomenology , there may be a lower critical dimension such that a more sophisticated analysis than the one we present here shows that fault - tolerant computation is possible for @xmath293 .",
    "it would be very interesting to show in any example that such is , or is not , the case .",
    "quantum error correction is one of the most interesting frameworks which allows long quantum computations @xcite .",
    "even though qec is widely accepted , it has been argued that it relies on a set of unphysical assumptions @xcite , namely : ( i ) `` fast '' measurements , ( ii ) `` fast '' gates , and ( iii ) describing decoherence by error models .",
    "although these are legitimate concerns , it is now clear that they are not fundamental : first , in ref .",
    "divincenzo and aliferis demonstrated that resilient circuits can be constructed with slow measurements .",
    "second , in the current paper , we have demonstrated that the fast gate assumption is not critical for fault tolerance .",
    "finally , we have laid the groundwork here for a theoretical framework that connects microscopic hamiltonians with error models in correlated environments . from our results for the threshold theorem in conjunction with those of akp @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that a large class of correlated environments are already properly treated within the qec framework .",
