    "usually these two explanations are seen as mutually contradicting @xcite .",
    "however , the process of optimization of a complex network includes not an external will ( a single designer ) but numerous agents .",

    "a new vertex is attached to one of vertices chosen to minimize a linear combination of ( i ) the resulting shortest - network - path distance between the new vertex _ and the root _ of the tree and ( ii ) the euclidean length of the new connection .",
    "the fkp model exploits the competition of two objectives : a desire to connect to the center of the network , which produces compact networks , and a desire to have a physically short , cheap connection .",
    "the geographical coordinates of vertices are taken to be random , as well as , in fact , the euclidean distances between vertices .",
    "so , one may roughly say that in this scheme , the combination of a length to the center of a network and a random number is optimized .",
    "consequently , the competition is actually between compactness and randomness .    in this paper",
    "we study the interplay between these two tendencies to compactness and to randomness as the mechanism of generation of complex networks .",
    "we formulate the problem in terms of preferential attachment and so link the optimization models to self - organization ones .",
    "we introduce the following model of a growing network ( tree ) :    * at each time step , a vertex is added to the network . * this vertex is attached to a vertex chosen with probability proportional to a function @xmath0 of its distance @xmath1 from the root .",
    "the preference function @xmath0 determines the structure of the network . as is natural , if @xmath2 , we arrive at the random attachment growth and at an exponential degree distribution .",
    "we show that if @xmath0 is rapidly decreasing , the resulting degree distribution of the finite network is of a complex form with several distinct parts . on the other hand , we find that in the infinite network limit , the degree distribution is a rapidly decreasing function .",

    "we explain the nature of this behavior of the degree distribution in networks of this kind .",
    "we mean the combination of a complex form in the finite networks , and a `` trivial '' one in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore , we show that one can essentially extend the range of the observation of the complex degree distributions by passing to more realistic models .",
    "note that a tree structure was assumed only to simplify analytical calculations ( it is easy to find intervertex distances in trees ) .",

    "( `` time '' is the current number vertices in the network . ) here the average means averaging over the entire ensemble of networks at time @xmath5 .",

    "note that the main fraction of vertices are leaves ( vertices of degree 1 ) .    what is the nature of this complex form of the degree distribution , i.e. , the nature of the plateau ?",

    "[ check , e.g. , in the particular case @xmath59 , relation ( [ e18 ] ) . ]",
    "on the other hand , expression ( [ e17 ] ) ( @xmath60 ) shows that the plateau is determined by the contribution of the nearest neighbors of the root .",
    "recall that the total number of these vertices is @xmath24 .",
    "one can see from expression ( [ e17 ] ) that @xmath60 is close to @xmath61 as @xmath62 . above this value of in - degree , @xmath60 is a rapidly decreasing dependence . note that @xmath63 .",
    "[ f1](a ) , [ f2](a ) , and [ f3](a ) demonstrate that indeed the width of the plateau is @xmath64 , and its height is @xmath61 .",
    "so , for the presence of the plateau in the degree distribution two conditions must be simultaneously fulfilled : ( i ) @xmath64 must be much greater than the mean in - degree of the network , i.e. , much greater than 1 ; ( ii ) @xmath61 must be large enough . figs .",
    "[ f2](a ) and [ f3](a ) show situations in finite networks where these conditions are satisfied .",
    "one can check that if the size of the network tends to infinity , the relative number of the nearest neighbors of the root approaches zero , @xmath65 , and the plateau disappears .",
    "thus , it is the nearest neighbors of the root that make the degree distribution of the network complex .",
    "the decrease of the fraction of these vertices in large networks makes the plateau unobservable and so trivializes the form of the degree distribution .",
    "we believe that this is a rather generic feature of networks of this kind .",
    "we mean networks , generated by optimization related algorithms , where a function of an intervertex distance is used in optimization ( or for selection a vertex for attachment ) . quite similarly to what we observed , in the fkp model , the `` complex '' , power - law part of the degree distribution disappears in the thermodynamic limit and vertices are almost surely leaves @xcite",
    ".    one might consider this trivialization in the thermodynamic limit as a defect of these constructions .",
    "however , most of real networks are not so large .",
    "empirical studies and simulations are mostly made for networks smaller than the networks in figs  [ f1][f3 ] .",
    "moreover , the typical sizes of networks in simulations of optimization mechanisms are 200 , 100 , and 50 vertices ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this sense , we observe complex architectures in quite large networks .",
    "the diminishing of the fraction of the nearest neighbors of the root , @xmath66 , in the network , which we consider in this paper , is a direct consequence of the narrow distribution of vertices over the distance @xmath1 from the root [ see figs  [ f1](b ) , [ f2](b ) , and [ f3](b ) ] .",
    "as the network grows , the mean distance of a vertex from the root , @xmath45 increases as @xmath67 ( which is meanwhile slower than a standard logarithmic dependence typical for networks with the small - world effect ) .",
    "simultaneously , the relative width of the distribution decreases [ see relation ( [ e14 ] ) ] , and approaches zero in the large network limit .",
    "it is important that this behavior of the relative width is practically generic for networks with the small - world effect . in other words , in infinitely large networks with the small - world effect , all vertices are almost surely mutually equidistant .",
    "so , in the large networks , even rapidly , exponentially decreasing preference function @xmath68 leads to attachments mostly to vertices at the distance @xmath45 from the root .",
    "consequently , in the large networks , the nearest neighbors of the root have few chances to attract new connections    in another form , the result of this evolution is shown in fig .  [ f4 ] : the average separation @xmath69 of a vertex from the root as a function of the degree of this vertex in a typical situation .",
    "this figure demonstrates that most vertices have the same separation from the root .",
    "note that the complementary characteristic , the mean in - degree of a vertex at distance @xmath1 from the root shows a quite different behavior :    @xmath70    [ we have used relation ( [ e10 ] ) ] .",
    "a number of modifications of the model are possible :    \\(1 ) an analytical solution has been obtained for the tree network , but in principle , one may also allow connections between already existing vertices using the same preference function .",
    "\\(2 ) one may introduce the variation of the preference function with the network growth , e.g. , use @xmath71 .",
    "this allows us to increase the range of network sizes , where the degree distribution has a complex form , but the model becomes ugly .",
    "\\(3 ) one may introduce an additional finite probability that a new vertex is attached to the root of the network .",
    "this leads to a finite fraction of the nearest neighbors of the root [ @xmath72 , the condensation of edges on the root ] , and so to the presence of the plateau in the degree distribution even in the infinite network .",
    "\\(4 ) if , nevertheless , we want to avoid the condensation of edges , we may , for example , modify the rules of the model in the following way .",
    "we introduce equiprobable attachment of a new vertex to the root or to any of its nearest neighbors .",
    "in other words , the `` center '' of the network consists now of the root and its nearest neighbors .",
    "let us discuss the last possibility in more detail .",
    "the evolution of the average degree of the root , @xmath24 , is described by the equation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability that a new vertex becomes attached to the `` center '' of the network .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath75 , so the solution of the equation is @xmath76 .",
    "it is convenient to use @xmath38 as a new `` time '' variable , instead of @xmath5 . in this case , the number of vertices in the `` center '' of the network per `` time '' step increases by 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of vertices , which become attached to the `` center '' vertices per time step , increases with @xmath38 as @xmath77 .",
    "so , the equation for the average number of the vertices of in - degree @xmath3 in the `` center '' of the network is of the form : @xmath78 & & +   \\frac{\\tau}{p}\\ , \\left [   \\frac{\\overline{n}(k-1,\\tau)}{\\tau } - \\frac{\\overline{n}(k,\\tau)}{\\tau } \\right ] \\ , . \\label{e21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the solution of this equation , @xmath79 , has a kink - like form : @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "so , the width of the plateau is @xmath82 .",
    "recall that in the original model , we had the plateau width @xmath64 with an extremely slowly growing @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , in the present situation , the number of vertices in the `` center '' of the network , @xmath24 , and the plateau width rapidly grow as @xmath83 .",
    "this allows one to observe highly connected vertices in larger networks than in the original net .",
    "note , however , that in the present case , in average , there is no more than one vertex of each degree in the plateau part of the distribution .",
    "we have proposed a class of networks exhibiting the mechanism of preferential compactness .",
    "new vertices prefer to be attached to the central part of a net , which favours compact structures .",
    "our approach links optimization concepts of complex networks to the self - organization mechanism .",
    "these networks , while growing , self - organize into compact structures , whose linear sizes are determined by the assumed preference functions .",
    "these thus fix a balance between tendencies to compactness and to randomness in the network growth .    as an example",
    ", we have studied a tree - like growing compact network ( the mean intervertex distance grows slower than the logarithm of the number of vertices ) .",
    "we have found that the degree distribution of the network has a complex ( non - power - law , in our particular case ) form only in the finite networks .",
    "the degree distribution trivializes in the large network limit , where this distribution consists only of a rapidly decreasing part .",
    "we have shown that this `` trivialization '' of the network structure is practically unavoidable if an intervertex distance is used in the optimization ( or preferential linking ) process . however , in our networks , the infinite network limit is approached slowly .",
    "so , the structures of even reasonably large ( but still finite ) networks , generated in this way , are complex .",
    "the relevant network sizes , where a complex distribution of connections is observable , turn out to be typical for many real and simulated networks .",
    "comparison with the fkp model shows that the observed behavior should be common for networks whose evolution is directly determined by separation between their vertices .",
