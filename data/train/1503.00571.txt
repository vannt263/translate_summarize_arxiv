    "well - quasi - ordering ( wqo ) is a highly desirable property and frequently discovered concept in mathematics and theoretical computer science @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable recent results in this area is the proof of wagner s conjecture stating that the set of all finite graphs is well - quasi - ordered by the minor relation @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the induced subgraph relation , since the set of cycles @xmath0 forms an infinite antichain with respect to this relation . on the other hand ,",
    "the induced subgraph relation may become a well - quasi - order when restricted to graphs in particular classes , such as cographs @xcite or @xmath1-letter graphs @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in both examples we deal with graphs of bounded clique - width , which is another property of great importance in mathematics and computer science .",
    "moreover , the same is true for all available examples of graph classes which are well - quasi - ordered by the induced subgraph relation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this raises an interesting question whether the clique - width is always bounded for graphs in well - quasi - ordered classes .",
    "this question was formally stated as an open problem by daligault , rao and thomass in @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we answer this question negatively by exhibiting a hereditary class of graphs of unbounded clique - width which is well - quasi - ordered by the induced subgraph relation .",
    "our result shows that it is generally non - trivial to determine whether a given problem definable in monadic second order ( mso ) logic is polynomially solvable on a wqo class , since unboundedness of clique - width does not allow a straightforward application of courcelle s theorem @xcite .",
    "this makes the wqo classes an interesting object to study from the algorithmic perspective . by the way",
    ", we are not aware of any result in flavour of @xcite applied to clique - width and @xmath2 , e.g. stating that if clique - width of a class is sufficiently large , then the @xmath2-model checking is intractable subject to a widely believed complexity theoretical assumption . therefore , in light of our result , the tractability of mso model checking on wqo classes looks an interesting open question .",
    "graphs in the class introduced in this paper are _ dense _ ( in particular , they are @xmath3-free ) .",
    "the density is a necessary condition , because an earlier result @xcite shows that for sparse graph classes ( those where a large biclique is forbidden as a subgraph ) well quasi - orderability by induced subgraphs imply bounded treewidth ( and hence bounded clique - width ) .",
    "we believe that the result of @xcite can be strengthened by showing that well quasi - orderability by induced subgraphs in sparse classes implies bounded pathwidth ( and hence _ linear _ clique - width @xcite ) .",
    "our result proved in the present paper shows a stark contrast between dense and sparse graphs in this context .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section  2",
    "we define the class of graphs studied in this paper and state the main result .",
    "the unboundedness of clique - width and well - quasi - orderability by induced subgraphs is proved in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we use standard graph - theoretic notation as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the notions of clique - width and well - quasi - ordering are introduced in respective sections where they are actually used .",
    "in this section , we define the class @xmath4 , which is the main object of the paper , and state the main result .",
    "let @xmath5 be a path with vertex set @xmath6 with two vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 being adjacent if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "for vertex @xmath7 , let _ power _ @xmath10 of @xmath7 be the largest @xmath11 that divides @xmath7 .",
    "for example , @xmath12 .",
    "add edges to @xmath5 that connect @xmath7 and @xmath8 whenever @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the graph obtained in this way by @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ dnpic ] illustrates graph @xmath15 .    .",
    "to avoid shading the picture with many edges , cliques are represented as rectangular boxes.,height=188 ]    clearly , the edges @xmath16 form a set of disjoint cliques and we call them _ power cliques_. if a power clique @xmath17 contains a vertex @xmath7 with @xmath18 we say that @xmath17 _ corresponds to _ @xmath11 .",
    "we call @xmath5 the _ body _ of @xmath14 , the edges of @xmath19 the _ path edges _ , and the edges of @xmath16 the _ clique edges_. the class @xmath4 is the set of all graphs @xmath14 and all their induced subgraphs . in what follows we prove that    * clique - width of graphs in @xmath4 is unbounded ( section  [ nbunbound ] ) , * graphs in @xmath4 are well - quasi - ordered by the induced subgraph relation ( section  [ secwqo ] ) .",
    "these two facts imply the following conclusion , which is the main result of the paper .    within the family of hereditary graph classes , there exist classes of unbounded clique - width which are well - quasi - ordered by the induced subgraph relation .",
    "the clique - width of a graph @xmath20 , denoted @xmath21 , is the minimum number of labels needed to construct the graph by means of the four graph operations : creation of a new vertex , disjoint union of two labeled graphs , connecting vertices with specified labels @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and renaming label @xmath7 to label @xmath8 .",
    "every graph @xmath20 can be constructed by means of these four operations , and the process of the construction can be described either by an algebraic expression or by a rooted binary tree , whose leaves correspond to the vertices of @xmath20 , the root corresponds to @xmath20 and the internal nodes correspond to the union operations .",
    "given a graph @xmath20 and a subset @xmath22 , we denote by @xmath23 the set @xmath24 .",
    "we say that two vertices @xmath25 are @xmath26-_similar _ if @xmath27 , i.e. if @xmath28 and @xmath29 have the same neighbourhood outside of @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , the @xmath26-similarity is an equivalence relation and we denote the number of similarity classes of @xmath26 by @xmath30 .",
    "also , we denote @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "our proof of the main result of this section is based on the following lemma .",
    "[ cwdnb ] for any graph @xmath20 , @xmath33 .",

    ", the binary tree @xmath34 has a node @xmath35 such that @xmath38 , in which case @xmath39 .",
    "hence the lemma .",
    "let @xmath40 , and let @xmath5 be the body of @xmath14 .",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the subgraph of @xmath5 induced by @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , @xmath41 is obtained from @xmath42 $ ] by removing the clique edges .",
    "since @xmath5 is a path , @xmath41 is a graph every connected component of which is a path .",
    "[ manysplits3 ] if @xmath41 has @xmath43 connected components , then @xmath44 .    in the @xmath7-th connected component of @xmath41 , @xmath45 ,",
    "we choose the last vertex ( listed along the path @xmath5 ) and denote it by @xmath46 .",
    "the next vertex of @xmath5 , denoted @xmath47 , belongs to @xmath23 .",
    "this creates a matching of size @xmath48 with edges @xmath49 .",
    "note that none of @xmath50 is a path edge for @xmath51 . among the chosen vertices of @xmath26 at least half",

    "their respective matched vertices of @xmath23 have the opposite parity .",
    "since the clique edges connect only the vertices of the _ same _ parity , we conclude that at least @xmath52 vertices of @xmath26 have pairwise different neighbourhoods in @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath44 .    note that if @xmath53 has @xmath48 connected components , then @xmath54 has at least @xmath55 connected components .",
    "therefore , in light of lemma [ manysplits3 ] , it remains to consider the case where both @xmath53 and @xmath54 have a limited number of connected components . by lemma [ cwdnb ]",
    "we can assume that both @xmath26 and @xmath23 are ` large ' , and hence each of @xmath53 and @xmath54 has a ` large ' connected component . in order to address this case we use the following lemma which states that a large number of power cliques intersecting both @xmath26 and @xmath23 implies a large value of @xmath56 .",

    "this implies that @xmath64 have pairwise different neighbourhoods in @xmath23 , that is @xmath58 .",
    "the only remaining ingredient to prove the main result of this section is the following lemma .    [ manybig ] let @xmath48 be a constant and @xmath65 a subpath of @xmath5 of length at least @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath65 intersects each of the power cliques corresponding to @xmath67 .",

    "this mapping guarantees that a factor @xmath105 of @xmath20 is isomorphic to the factor @xmath207 of @xmath199 .",
    "therefore it remains to check that adjacency relation between vertices in different factors is preserved under the defined mapping .",
    "note that adjacency between two vertices in different factors is determined entirely by powers of these vertices .",
    "moreover , corollary [ intiso ] and property ( 3 ) of @xmath204 imply that our mapping preserves powers of all vertices except possibly maximal vertices of power more that @xmath48 . therefore in order to complete the proof we need only to make sure that in graph @xmath20 a maximal vertex @xmath173 of a factor @xmath105 with @xmath213 is adjacent to a vertex @xmath68 in a factor different from @xmath105 if and only if the corresponding images of @xmath173 and @xmath68 are adjacent in @xmath199 .",
