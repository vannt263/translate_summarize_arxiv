    "the most massive galaxies in the universe are thought to form from the largest density peaks in the primordial matter distribution .",
    "galaxy mergers change the initial galaxy mass function , forming more massive galaxies by combining less massive ones .",
    "the result is the galaxy mass distribution we see in the local universe , empirically described by the @xcite luminosity function , together with a morphology - dependent mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the luminosity function also depends upon the star formation history of galaxies , regulated by gas content , gas accretion , stellar feedback , and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback .",
    "galaxy mergers play an important role here too , since tidal torques in merging systems force gas into the galaxy centers , leading to starburst activity that grows the stellar bulge and agn activity that grows the supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "galaxies segregate into two major classes based on color and morphology @xcite .",
    "blue , star - forming disks ( late - type galaxies , ltgs ) lie in one region of color - space called the blue - sequence .",
    "red - and - dead spheroids ( early - type galaxies , etgs ) lie in a different region of color space called the red sequence .",
    "ltgs demonstrate a correlation between star formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass ( @xmath10 ) called the star - forming main sequence ( sfms : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the sfms may be a consequence of an equilibrium between inflowing gas and star - formation driven outflows , with the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) regulated by the halo mass growth rate @xcite .",
    "most etgs on the other hand have much lower sfrs because they lack the cold gas needed to sustain star formation .",
    "it appears that there is a limit to the mass of star - forming disk galaxies of roughly @xmath11 , with the most massive disk galaxies transitioning away from the main sequence as their ssfr declines .",
    "this decline appears to be a gradual process , occurring over a period longer than 1 gyr after the gas supply to the galaxy disk has been interrupted @xcite .",
    "rapid quenching does not appear to occur for most galaxies that remain disk galaxies , contrary to early attempts to explain the apparently bimodal distribution of galaxy colors .    a number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain why the gas supply is interrupted for the most massive disk galaxies .",
    "major galaxy mergers may disrupt merging disk galaxies and transform them rapidly into elliptical galaxies @xcite , though this does not explain the transformation of galaxies that remain disks .",
    "the accretion of cold gas onto a galaxy may be stopped when the galaxy halo becomes massive enough that accretion shocks develop , interrupting the cold streams of gas needed to replenish the disk @xcite . increasing agn feedback from a growing supermassive black hole may shock or eject gas from the galaxy disk , reducing its capacity to form stars @xcite .",
    "ram - pressure stripping of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by the intercluster medium ( icm ) of a galaxy cluster can also remove cold gas @xcite .",
    "studying the most massive spiral galaxies can give us clues as to which of the above evolutionary processes are primarily responsible for converting star - forming disk galaxies into red - and - dead lenticulars or ellipticals .",
    "the existence of rapidly star - forming , massive spirals with @xmath12 indicates that disk galaxies can postpone this fate under special circumstances .",
    "we present here the most optically luminous and biggest spiral galaxies at redshift @xmath6 , found by mining the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for computing all linear sizes and luminosities .",
    "this project is an offshoot of our work to determine the completeness of ned and explore its potential for systematic studies of galaxy populations ( ogle , p. et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "ned provides a unique fusion of multi - wavelength photometry from _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , among others , which we augment by _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ) photometry , that allows us to estimate stellar masses and sfrs .",
    "we compared the redshift distribution of galaxies in ned at @xmath6 to a model redshift distribution for the universe derived using a redshift - independent luminosity function , in order to estimate the spectroscopic completeness of ned .",
    "we used the @xcite luminosity function fits of @xcite , which are based on @xmath16150,000 sdss galaxies as our benchmark .",
    "we adopt their characteristic absolute magnitude value of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 erg s@xmath3 at 6200@xmath19 ) for the sdss @xmath0-band luminosity function .",
    "the redshift limit was made large enough to capture the rarest , most luminous galaxies , but not so large as to require consideration of redshift evolution in the luminosity function .",
    "sdss is the largest source of spectroscopic redshifts , with a spectroscopic selection limit of @xmath20 ( strauss et al .",
    "we find that ned is complete over the sdss footprint out to @xmath21 for galaxies with @xmath7 , the most optically luminous and massive galaxies in the low - redshift universe .",
    "our sample is chosen from the 797,729 galaxies ( type@xmath22 g ) in ned with spectroscopic redshifts @xmath6 , in the sdss footprint , and detected in sdss @xmath0 band .",
    "we apply galactic extinction corrections ( tabulated by ned ) and k - corrections to the @xmath0-band magnitudes prior to making our sample selection .",
    "we find 1616 galaxies with redshift @xmath6 and luminosity @xmath7 , which constitute our ogle et al .",
    "galaxy catalog ( ogc ) .",
    "the most luminous galaxy in the ogc is a @xmath23 elliptical brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "we make a further selection for uv emission because we are interested in finding the most massive , actively star - forming disk galaxies .",
    "we recently matched and integrated the _ galex _ all - sky survey catalog ( gasc ) and _ galex _ medium sky survey catalog ( gmsc ) with ned , using an automated , statistical algorithm @xcite .",
    "we inspected the sdss images of all 196 galaxies from the ogc that are detected in the _ galex _ nuv band ( the ogc - uv subsample ) .",
    "of these , we find 46 nuv - detected , @xmath7 galaxies with spiral morphology ( table 1 ) .",
    "the remaining nuv sources include 118 ellipticals , 11 galaxies with e+a spectra , 2 quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) with extended emission , and 19 galaxies with erroneous redshifts or magnitudes .",
    "the most luminous elliptical galaxy in ogc - uv is a @xmath24 bcg , while the most luminous spiral galaxy has @xmath25 .",
    "we inspected the 310 brightest galaxies of the full ogc sample , those with @xmath26 , to see if we are missing any spirals with uv selection .",
    "of these , we classified 11 super spirals , 253 ellipticals , 38 galaxies with erroneous redshifts or magnitudes , 6 lenticulars , 1 irregular , and 1 e+a galaxy .",
    "this inventory includes 7 additional super spirals ( table 1 ) that are not in the ogc - uv sample . of these",
    ", 4 have no _ galex _ sources nearby , and 3 others have nearby _ galex _ sources that should be matched in ned , but are not , possibly because of confusion .",
    "this shows that our nuv selection , while relatively efficient ( 47/196 ) compared to morphological selection ( 11/310 ) , leads to an incomplete sample , with only 4/11 super spirals recovered in this luminosity range .",
    "part of the incompleteness ( 3/11 ) is owing to incomplete matching of _ galex _ with ned , while the rest ( 4/11 ) may be attributed to the _ galex _ detection limit or coverage .",
    "we conduct our investigation of super spirals primarily with photometry compiled by ned .",
    "we use sdss dr6 @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath0 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 photometry measured with the cmodel method , which combines exponential plus devaucouleurs model fitting .",
    "_ galex _ fuv and nuv photometry is taken from the gasc and gmsc , measured within a kron elliptical aperture .",
    "we use 2mass @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 total magnitudes from the 2mass extended source catalog ( 2masx ) .",
    "ned objects are matched to allwise sources using the gator tool in the infrared science archive ( irsa ) .",
    "we use allwise 4.6 and 12 @xmath34 m photometry within the largest available fixed - radius aperture of @xmath35 , which is well - matched to the largest galaxy in our sample , with semimajor axis @xmath36 .",
    "the sdss and _ wise _ colors of super spirals lie along the blue sequence , similarly to less luminous star - forming disk galaxies ( figure [ 1](a ) ) .",
    "the sdss comparison sample is adopted from @xcite , who show that ltgs and etgs classified by galaxy zoo ( gz ) @xcite are well - separated in _ wise _ [ 4.6]@xmath37[12 ] vs. sdss @xmath38 color space .",
    "the _ wise _ [ 4.6]@xmath37[12 ] color ranges from 2.0 to 4.2 , typical of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) and warm dust emission from gas - rich , actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "the @xmath38 color ranges from 1.4 to 4.4 , indicating star - forming disks with a range of ssfr or dust extinction .",
    "we estimate differential k - corrections of @xmath39 mag in the redshift range @xmath40 , by convolving several spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models ( e.g. , those in the appendix ) with the sdss filter curves .",
    "these corrections are not large enough to explain the additional scatter in the observed @xmath38 colors of super spirals .",
    "there is a shift in the locus of super spiral colors compared to less - massive blue sequence galaxies .",
    "super spirals tend to have redder @xmath38 and bluer [ 4.6]@xmath37[12 ] colors compared to the sdss distribution .",
    "this could in principle indicate either lower ssfr or increased extinction .",
    "however , the high ssfr of our sample ( figure [ 1](b ) ) runs contrary to the first explanation .",
    "six super spirals have @xmath41 , a value not attained by less luminous sdss ltgs . the two reddest galaxies ( ss 53 and ss 09 )",
    "may be misclassified peculiar elliptical galaxies with prominent shells .",
    "cgcg 122 - 067 ( ss 50 ) may be redder because of its double bulge .",
    "the other 4 are clearly spirals , and require further investigation and custom photometry to determine the cause of their unusually red @xmath38 colors .",
    "we estimate stellar mass from 2mass @xmath33 luminosity together with an sdss @xmath38 color - dependent mass - to - light ratio estimated using the prescription of @xcite , giving @xmath42 .",
    "we apply a small correction to the stellar masses to convert to a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this yields stellar masses that are consistent with more sophisticated sed template fitting ( appendix ) .",
    "we find stellar masses in the range @xmath5 .",
    "we estimate the sfr from the _ wise _ 12 @xmath34 m luminosity using the prescription of @xcite , which was established by sed - fitting more than 630,000 sdss galaxies with magphys @xcite . while accurate for star - forming galaxies , this method may overestimate the star - formation rate for early type galaxies where dust may be heated by other sources not directly related to star formation , or in the presence of a luminous agn .",
    "we further validate our _ wise _ single - band sfrs against magphys sed - fitting for two representative super spirals ( appendix ) .",
    "the _ wise _ 12 @xmath34 m monochromatic luminosities of super spirals range from @xmath43 erg s@xmath3 ( @xmath44 ) , corresponding to sfrs of @xmath9 yr@xmath3 .",
    "we compare our sample to the sdss-_wise _ sample of @xcite , who estimated sfr and @xmath10 with magphys .",
    "we find that most super spirals lie well above an extrapolation of the star - forming main sequence to higher mass ( figure [ 1](b ) ) .",
    "this is a region of the sfr vs. mass diagram that is very sparsely populated .",
    "the vast majority of sdss disk galaxies in this mass range have significantly lower sfr and ssfr .",
    "our @xmath0-band luminosity plus nuv detection criteria tend to select galaxies with high global star formation rates .",
    "however , the sdss spectra reveal a relatively old bulge stellar population for most super spirals .",
    "we do find an indication of starburst activity in the sdss bulge spectra of 3 super spirals ( ss 05see appendix , ss 15 , and ss 44 ) with strong young stellar population contributions and high - equivalent width h@xmath45 emission .",
    "these three galaxies also have relatively blue sdss @xmath38 colors and red _ wise _ [ 4.6]@xmath37[12 ] colors , both indicative of a high global ssfr .",
    "the super spiral galaxies in our sample contain 3 seyfert 1 nuclei and 2 qsos with broad balmer lines and strong [ o iii ] in their sdss spectra ( table 1 ) .",
    "there is also 1 seyfert 2 nucleus with strong [ o iii ] but narrow balmer lines .",
    "there is likely a dominant contribution from the qso to the ir luminosity of 2masx j15430777 + 1937522 ( ss 10 ) , which has the greatest _ wise _ 12 @xmath34 m luminosity of our sample ( @xmath46 erg s@xmath3 or @xmath47 ) .",
    "the two qsos are also detected at x - ray wavelengths by rosat .",
    "one additional galaxy ( 2masx j10095635 + 2611324 @xmath22 ss 45 ) is detected in x - rays , but has no obvious signature of an agn in its sdss nuclear spectrum .",
    "there is so far no indication of any extended x - ray emission associated with super spirals , though none have been specifically targeted for this",
    ". it will be important to make deep x - ray observations of super spirals to quantify any x - ray halo emission in comparison to giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "only two super spirals are detected by the nvss radio survey ( 2masx j14472834 + 5908314 @xmath22 ss 47 and cgcg 122 - 067 @xmath22 ss 50 ) , but the resolution is insufficient to distinguish between radio emission from star formation activity or from a radio jet .",
    "the presence of luminous agns in 11% of super spirals indicates that they are continuing to grow their supermassive black holes .",
    "it is imperative to measure the distribution of bulge and supermassive black hole masses in our super spiral sample to see if they follow the same relation as lower - mass spiral bulges .",
    "the sizes of super spirals range from 57 to 134 kpc , with a median size of 72 kpc , using the sdss dr6 @xmath0-band isophotal diameter at 25.0 mag arcsec@xmath48 ( table 1 and figure [ 2 ] ) .",
    "their deprojected sfr surface densities range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath48 .",
    "a plot of sfr vs. diameter shows considerable scatter ( figure [ 2 ] ) .",
    "however , the five most rapidly star - forming galaxies , with @xmath51 , all have diameters @xmath52 kpc .",
    "the most mir - luminous super spiral ( sdss j094700.08 + 254045.7 , see appendix ) , also has the largest deprojected sfr surface density .",
    "the largest super spiral , 2masx j16394598 + 4609058 ( ss 03 , figure [ 3 ] ) , has a diameter of 134 kpc and a relatively low sfr surface density of @xmath53 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath48 .",
    "super spirals display a range of morphologies , from flocculent to grand - design spiral patterns ( figure [ 4 ] ) .",
    "at least 9 super spirals have prominent stellar bars visible in the sdss images ( table 1 : notes ) .",
    "there are morphological peculiarities in several cases , including one - arm spirals , multi - arm spirals , rings , and asymmetric spiral structure ( figure [ 4 ] and table 1 ) .",
    "these types of features may indicate past or ongoing galaxy mergers or collisions .",
    "we make use of the bulge - disk decompositions of @xcite to quantify the relative contributions of the bulge and disk to the luminosity of super spirals ( table 2 ) .",
    "the galaxy @xmath28 and @xmath0 band sdss images are jointly fit by a de vaucouleurs profile for the bulge ( sersic index @xmath54 ) , plus an exponential disk .",
    "we compare super spirals to a representative subsample of 4686 spiral galaxies with @xmath55 classified by galaxy zoo ( gz , figure [ 5 ] ) , with bulge - disk decompositions also by @xcite .",
    "we find a much narrower distribution of @xmath0-band bulge to total luminosity ( @xmath56 ) for super spirals , with a median value of @xmath57 , and a deficit of @xmath56 values @xmath58 . a kolmogorov - smirnoff ( k - s ) test shows that the distributions differ significantly , with a probability of only 0.0027 that super spirals",
    "are drawn from the same population as gz spirals .",
    "the lack of super spirals with @xmath59 may be consistent with a past history of significant merger activity .",
    "the bulge ellipticity distribution of super spirals is not significantly different from that of gz spirals ( figure [ 5](c ) ) .",
    "we note that since the profile fits do not include a bar component , the ellipticities may be augmented by the presence of a bar or double bulge .",
    "the disk inclination distribution of super spirals also differs significantly from that of gz spirals , and from the expected @xmath60 dependence ( figure [ 5](b ) ) .",
    "a k - s test gives a probability of @xmath61 that super spirals and gz spirals are drawn from the same inclination distribution .",
    "only 5 ( 9% ) of super spirals have inclinations of @xmath62 , compared to the expectation of 50% for randomly oriented disks .",
    "this indicates that we are missing roughly 45% of the super spirals in our luminosity range , possibly because of internal extinction at the nuv selection wavelength .",
    "the gz spiral inclination distribution also differs from the expectation for randomly oriented disks , with an _ excess _ at inclinations @xmath63 that may reveal a bias for gz to classify edge on disks as spirals or to misclassify edge - on lenticulars as spirals .",
    "the median disk exponential scale length of super spirals is 12.2 kpc , 2.3 times as large as the 5.3 kpc median for gz spirals , confirming the giant disk sizes of super spirals ( figure [ 5]d ) .",
    "a k - s test gives a probability of @xmath61 that super spirals and gz spirals are drawn from the same size distribution .",
    "the galaxy smoothness parameter @xcite , which quantifies the fractional residuals to the model fit inside two half - light radii , is @xmath64 in r band .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath65 parameters of bulge - disk decompositions have been used by others to quantitatively select early - type galaxies , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 as criteria @xcite .",
    "several super spirals in our sample meet these criteria , but we are nevertheless confident of the detection of a significant spiral disk in most of these cases .",
    "we find four super spiral merger candidates with apparent double stellar bulges or double nuclei ( figure [ 6 ] ) .",
    "the sdss spectra only cover the dominant or central bulge or nucleus of each system .",
    "spectroscopy of the secondary bulges or nuclei will be necessary to confirm or rule out these merger candidates as true physical pairs or multiples .    the merger candidate 2masx j08542169 + 0449308 ( ss 22 ) appears to be a nearly equal mass major spiral pre - merger .",
    "the arms of both spirals are wound in the same direction , and the disks appear to be overlapping in the plane of the sky .",
    "the stretched out spiral arms of both spiral galaxy components , together with an apparent tidal arm at pa@xmath68 ( measured counterclockwise from north ) suggest an ongoing tidal interaction .",
    "the merger candidate 2masx j16014061 + 2718161 ( ss 37 ) is a bcg , surrounded by several other disk galaxy companions ( figures [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the host cluster is identified as gmbcg j240.41924 + 27.30444 , with a photometric redshift of 0.193 ( table 3 ) .",
    "there are clear distortions to the spiral structures of both spiral galaxy components that appear to be involved in this merger .",
    "the merger candidate 2masx j09334777 + 2114362 ( ss 46 ) appears to be a double agn system . the primary",
    ", central nucleus is identified as an sdss qso .",
    "the secondary nucleus has similar flux and color to the primary nucleus , but it does not have an sdss spectrum to confirm that it is a true physical double agn .",
    "the galaxy disk has high surface brightness , suggestive of starburst activity .",
    "faint outer spiral arms are also suggestive of a recent galaxy interaction .",
    "the merger candidate and bcg cgcg 122 - 067 ( ss 50 ) appears to be a late stage @xmath69:1 major merger .",
    "the double bulge is surrounded by a common inner disk .",
    "two giant spiral arms emerge from this central disk , one from each bulge , making a complete circuit around the disk .",
    "a large gap is seen between the arms at pa@xmath70 .",
    "there are three other possible merging nuclei , including a bright green point source at pa@xmath71 , that raise the possibility that this is a five - component multiple merger system .",
    "such multiple mergers are reminiscent of the elliptical nest galaxies that are sometimes found at the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "we checked ned for known galaxy clusters and groups within @xmath72 of each super spiral ( table 3 ) .",
    "seven of the super spirals are candidate bcgs , within @xmath73 of a galaxy cluster .",
    "two are candidate brightest group galaxies ( bggs ) , within @xmath72 of a compact galaxy group .",
    "most of the clusters only have photometric redshifts and have yet to be verified spectroscopically . however , the photometric redshifts are all within @xmath74 of the super spiral spectroscopic redshift , which suggests a true physical association .",
    "the two associations of super spirals with compact groups are only based on their small angular separation , with no independent redshift available for the groups .",
    "we used ned s environment tool to further explore the environments of the super spiral bcg and bgg candidates .",
    "this tool performs a redshift - constrained cone search for galaxies and galaxy clusters within a sphere of comoving radius 10 mpc . because of the high redshifts of the super spirals , only the most luminous galaxies in their neighborhoods will tend to have measured spectroscopic redshifts in ned .",
    "we tabulate the number of galaxies ( n1 ) with spectroscopic redshifts that are within 1 mpc and 500 km s@xmath3 , and the number ( n10 ) within 10 projected mpc and 5000 km s@xmath3 . the mspm 05544 galaxy cluster , which appears to host the super spiral cgcg 122 - 067 ( ss 50 ) has the largest number of cluster members with spectroscopic redshifts in ned ( 302 ) , while the sdsscgb 59704 galaxy group has the smallest number ( 2 ) .",
    "these numbers should be taken as lower limits to the cluster membership , depending primarily on the sdss spectroscopic selection limit and redshift .",
    "there are likely more clusters to be discovered in the vicinity of super spirals .",
    "for example , a clear overdensity of galaxies is seen to the se of 2masx j11535621 + 4923562 ( ss 17 , figure [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we verify a concentration of 69 galaxies within 10 mpc and 5000 km s@xmath3 ( table 3 : ogc 0586 cluster ) , using ned s environment tool .",
    "we estimate the mean redshift of ogc 0586 cluster to be @xmath75 , from 12 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that are within 5 projected mpc of ss 17 .",
    "while super spirals have similar structure to less luminous spiral galaxies , they are impressive in the vastness of their scale .",
    "a sense of how truly enormous these galaxies are can be gained by comparison to other galaxies in the same cluster ( figure [ 8 ] : ogc 0586 cluster ) .",
    "the 2masx j11535621@xmath764923562 ( ss 17 ) super spiral at @xmath77 , with a luminosity of @xmath78 and a diameter of 90 kpc , can be compared to a more common , less luminous spiral galaxy which has @xmath79 and a diameter of 39 kpc ( @xmath80 ) , at about the same redshift ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether any analogs to super spirals have been found at lower redshift .",
    "one well - known example of a giant spiral galaxy is malin 1 ( @xmath82 ) , initially suggested to be a proto - disk galaxy because of its massive h i disk @xcite .",
    "while malin 1 does have one of the largest stellar disks known , with an exponential scale length of 70 kpc , its global @xmath0-band luminosity ( @xmath83 ) is not nearly great enough to make it into the ogc catalog .",
    "its disk has very low surface brightness and is not readily visible in sdss images . as further points of comparison",
    ", we estimate a global stellar mass of @xmath84 and global sfr of @xmath85 yr@xmath3 , which are both much lower than the range spanned by super spirals .    other giant spiral galaxies are found in the local universe , though they also have considerably lower luminosities than the super spirals in our sample .",
    "@xcite find 107 spiral galaxies in the uppsala general catalog of galaxies ( ugc ) at @xmath86 , with cosmology - corrected @xmath87-band isophotal diameters ( at @xmath88 mag arcsec@xmath48 ) of @xmath89 kpc , similar to super spirals .",
    "the 39 giant ugc spirals with sdss photometry in ned have @xmath0-band luminosities of @xmath90 , stellar masses of @xmath91 to @xmath92 yr@xmath3 , and sfrs of @xmath93 yr@xmath3 .",
    "because of their considerably lower stellar masses , they can not be faded super spirals , but could be useful analogs for understanding giant disks .",
    "one of the largest giant spiral galaxies , ugc 2885 has a rotational velocity of 280 km s@xmath3 at a radius of 60 kpc , and has undergone fewer than 10 rotations at its outer edge in the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "super spirals may also be related to the cold sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) discovered at redshift @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the relatively cold ( @xmath95 k ) dust temperatures of these smgs may indicate starburst activity in a disk rather than a spheroid . in comparison ,",
    "the fir sed of super spiral 2masx j13275756 + 3345291 ( ss 05 , see appendix ) is fit by the sum of a cold dust component with @xmath96 k , likely from the disk , and a warmer dust component with temperature @xmath97 k , likely from the starbursting bulge .",
    "gn20 , one of the most luminous sub - mm detected star bursting galaxies , shows molecular gas and star formation distributed in a 10 kpc scale disk at @xmath98 @xcite . deep near to mid - ir imaging of smgs at intermediate redshifts",
    "will be necessary to measure their sizes and stellar masses and better determine their relationship to super spirals .",
    "we estimate an average super spiral number density of @xmath99 gpc@xmath100 at @xmath6 , correcting for @xmath101 incompleteness at high disk inclination (  4.5 ) .",
    "the space density of super spirals is therefore only @xmath102 of the space density of elliptical galaxies in the same @xmath0-band luminosity range .",
    "even the largest galaxy evolution simulations to date , such as the illustris simulation @xcite , covering @xmath103 gpc@xmath104 , are not big enough to manufacture a significant number of super spirals .",
    "therefore , no adequate prediction exists for the expected number of super spirals at @xmath6 , nor are there simulations showing how these giant disk galaxies might form .",
    "super spirals could be formed by gas - rich major spiral - spiral mergers .",
    "simulations that collide two gas - rich disk galaxies are able to produce post - merger spiral galaxies , albeit at smaller scale @xcite . while merging stellar disks are typically destroyed , the gas in the outer disks may combine to reform an even larger gas and stellar disk .",
    "orbital geometry may also be important , with misaligned or retrograde orbits leading to more gas - rich final merger products .",
    "if the dynamical timescales are longer and the merger - induced torques are even weaker in the outer disks of super spiral mergers , this may also be conducive to the preservation of gas disks and reformation of stellar disks . alternatively , super spirals might be formed more gradually , from the inside out by accretion of cold gas .",
    "this may require a relatively low halo mass in order to avoid accretion shocks , which might prevent the gas from settling onto the outer disk @xcite .",
    "it will be important to study the spatial distribution of both neutral gas and star formation in super spirals to gain further insight into how their disks are formed .",
    "it appears that the super spirals in our sample have so far avoided the fate of the vast majority of the most massive galaxies and continue to form stars in spite of their extreme mass , bucking the trend of cosmic downsizing .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this success .",
    "first , super spirals may be robust to mergers because of their massive , dissipative gaseous disks .",
    "it appears that several super spirals in our sample have survived recent major mergers with their star - forming disks intact .",
    "second , the supermassive black holes in super spiral bulges may not be large enough to provide enough feedback to drive away the gas in the giant galaxy disk .",
    "third , the halo mass may not be large enough to cut off cold accretion onto the disk via accretion shocks .",
    "finally , a large enough gas reservoir may have already settled into the disk to fuel star formation for a long time into the future .",
    "observations across the electromagnetic spectrum are called for to distinguish among these possibilities .",
    "super spirals occupy a relatively empty corner of the sfr vs. stellar mass diagram ( figure [ 1]b ) .",
    "they lie above an extrapolation of the star - forming main sequence , at the most extreme mass and sfr .",
    "we find that most super spirals have ssfr @xmath105 gyr@xmath3 .",
    "they are forming stars at a rate that would allow them to build up their mass in less than the age of the universe .",
    "this is unlike similarly massive , yet much more common disk galaxies ( early type spirals and lenticulars ) that fall below the star - forming main sequence , in what we shall call the disk quenching sequence ( dqs : the disk galaxy subset of the green valley population ) .",
    "the disk - quenching sequence is discussed in the context of ssfr and uv color evolution by @xcite , and in the context of ir color evolution by @xcite .",
    "quenching disk galaxies are likely greatly reduced in their ability to form stars because their supply of cold gas has been cut off ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most densely populated ridge of the dqs is close to the median stellar mass of our super spiral sample ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "we suggest that the majority of disk galaxies along this ridge were once super spirals . at a minimum",
    ", galaxies of this mass must have attained an average sfr@xmath107 yr@xmath3 in order to have formed in less than the age of the universe .",
    "this would put them squarely in the sfr and ssfr range of super spirals .",
    "a further implication is that their @xmath108 kpc diameter stellar disks must have faded dramatically .",
    "if fossil giant disks are detected around massive lenticular galaxies with deep imaging , it will provide strong evidence for this hypothesis .",
    "in addition , deep h i and co observations may reveal if their cold gas reservoir has been entirely depleted or reduced to a level that is not conducive to star formation .",
    "we report the discovery of a large sample of the most optically luminous ( @xmath7 ) , biggest , and most massive spiral galaxies in the universe , which we call super spirals .",
    "these galaxies are very rare ( @xmath99 gpc@xmath100 ) , but are easily observed out to @xmath21 because of their high luminosities and gigantic sizes .",
    "super spirals are forming stars at @xmath9 yr@xmath3 , a rate greater than their mean sfr over the age of the universe .",
    "bulge - disk decompositions confirm the presence of giant stellar disks , with a median exponential scale length of 12.2 kpc , 2.3 times the median scale length of less luminous spirals at the same redshift .",
    "the bulge - to - total optical luminosity distribution is also significantly different for super spirals , showing a deficit of galaxies with @xmath59 , and a concentration of galaxies with @xmath109 .",
    "roughly 11% of super spirals have seyfert or qso nuclei , suggesting that they are still actively adding mass to their supermassive black holes .",
    "we find evidence that several super spirals are undergoing major mergers , but manage to keep their star - forming disks intact , and avoid being transformed in to red - and - dead elliptical galaxies .",
    "some super spirals are brightest cluster galaxies , while others appear to be isolated in the field .",
    "we suggest that super spirals may be the progenitors of red and dead lenticular galaxies of similar mass .",
