    "liquid droplets on a solid surfaces pose several interesting theoretical and experimental challenges and has a direct importance in several industrial processes .",
    "in general , the interaction of the liquid with the surface is characterized through the contact angle that a droplet , with known volume , makes with the surface . for a flat , chemically homogeneous surface , the equilibrium contact angle is easily obtained from an energy minimization procedure .",
    "the result , known as young s law , includes the three surface energies ( solid - liquid , solid - vapor , liquid - vapor , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , respectively ) with a `` weight factor '' for the last one , the cosine of the contact angle , @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamical approach to equilibrium is also well understood , both for complete @xcite and partial @xcite wetting . in reality , the static contact angle , as well as its dynamics , is obviously influenced by the variations in the physicochemical or geometrical properties of the substrate on which the droplet spreads @xcite .",
    "such surfaces are present in an enormous variety of industrial processes .",
    "typical examples range from printing and coating to painting , as well as the creation of tailored superhydrophobic surfaces @xcite .",
    "the static contact angles for surfaces with local variation can be obtained from variants of the original energy minimisation .",
    "the classic cassie - baxter treatment for spatially varying surface energies , considers a simple spatial average , ie .",
    ", @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "likewise , wenzel law for surfaces with height variations introduces the ratio - always larger than unity - of the total surface to the projected surface as a correction factor @xcite .",
    "clearly both cassie - baxter and wenzel treatments may not apply in practice , since a droplet spreading towards equilibrium will encounter several pinning states in which it can be trapped , thereby never reaching the theoretical result @xcite .",
    "this is a much - studied issue both experimentally and theoretically , particularly for engineered surfaces .",
    "approaches that have been tried range from hydrodynamic simulations of spreading to quasi - static considerations @xcite . in all cases , a crucial concept is the spreading power , or the difference of the actual contact angle from the static or equilibrium one .",
    "here we analyze the consequences of surface heterogeneity on the spreading and final static state of liquid droplets .",
    "our approach centers on the evolution of the droplet radius , as defined by the contact line that separates the wetted and non - wetted parts of the substrate .",
    "the radii are then easily related to values of contact angle through volume conservation .",
    "the droplet radius evolves under the influence of three factors : i ) the imbalance in surface tension , directly related to the spreading power , ii ) the quenched noise , induced by the locally varying surface properties , that introduces angular deformation in the radius , and iii ) contact line elasticity that tends to smoothen radius angular variations .",
    "we use contact line pinning and depinning dynamics to follow the evolution of the droplet radius . in the initial stages of spreading",
    ", surface tension imbalance controls the dynamics .",
    "however , as the droplet spreads , disorder effects start to dominate and the contact line comes to a halt _ before _ an equilibrium state can be reached .",
    "disorder , elasticity and spreading thus predict a _ pinning transition _ for the contact line , and thus a droplet _ pinning radius _ that is sample - dependent .",
    "we show how this depends on the the independent parameters of the theory : disorder strength , disorder length - scale , droplet radius and volume , and the fluid properties such as surface energy and contact angle .",
    "we further obtain the statistical distributions of the pinning radius .",
    "small droplets are strongly effected by disorder , leading to results that are markedly different from what could be expected within a wenzel or cassie - baxter framework .",
    "disorder effects are apparent in the case of droplets with a small contact angle and disorder variations that are correlated on a short length - scale with respect to the droplet radius .",
    "the pinning predictions for the contact angle have simple experimental consequences : they can be tested by varying for a given type of surface the nominal contact angle ( by changing liquid for instance ) and by varying the droplet size .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section [ intro ]",
    "we outline the basic spreading phenomena as well as the approach to the pinning phase .",
    "droplet spreading in the pinning phase is analyzed in details in section [ model ] , and section [ final ] finishes with conclusions .",
    "we consider a liquid droplet with air / liquid interfacial tension @xmath2 , density @xmath5 and viscosity @xmath6 deposited on a macroscopically flat surface . when the size of the droplet is smaller than the capillary length @xmath7 , the droplet has the overall shape of a spherical cap with basal radius @xmath8 , the air / liquid interface joining the solid surface with contact angle @xmath9 . for a perfectly homogeneous surface",
    ", the equilibrium contact angle @xmath10 can be obtained from young s law : @xmath11 related to the equilibrium radius @xmath12 via the drop volume @xmath13 : @xmath14 this relation reduces to @xmath15 for small contact angles @xmath16 .",
    "equation [ eq : young ] has to be supplemented by a correction term involving the line tension @xmath17 , related to @xmath18 , the curvature of the contact line @xcite @xmath19 the actual value of the line tension remains a difficult quantity to measure , due to chemical or topographical heterogeneity of the substrate and the difficulty to perform experimental work with sub - micron sized droplets . in general , the value of the line tension can be estimated to be @xmath20 , thus representing a relevant correction only for droplets with nanometer range dimensions .",
    "substrate disorder induces variations in the contact line and hence in the local values of the contact angle and radius of the droplet .",
    "if @xmath21 is the local coordinate along the contact line , the local droplet radius is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spatially averaged radius .",
    "variations along the contact line are connected to variations of the local contact angle @xmath24 , since the overall volume of the drop is conserved .",

    "it includes the chemical contrast ( via the variation of the surface energies , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where the indices denote the solid - vapor and solid - liquid cases , respectively ) and may also include surface roughness through local surface tilts @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the slowly evolving dynamics of the drop . this can be achieved experimentally by slowly depositing a droplet on the substrate , thereby avoiding initial impaction effects .",
    "after that , the viscous contact line dynamics dictates the ( slow ) evolution of the droplet @xcite .",
    "the analysis does not apply to volatile liquids and the ohnesorge number @xmath38 is an appropriate parameter to estimate how viscous the liquid must be in order to prevent inertial as well as front instability ( coming from evaporation ) effects to occur @xcite .",
    "we only consider microscopic disorder such that the length scales @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the smallest length scales of the problem .",
    "the droplet then globally keeps a spherical shape , with disorder inducing variations in the contact line itself .    on a disordered surface ,",

    ", if @xmath44 , @xmath45 until @xmath46 at which point a wetting film should be formed .",
    "both approaches however neglect that spreading is a dynamical phenomenon and that a droplet may become pinned in several configurations before reaching equilibrium .",
    "spatial scales and correlations of the disorder are also not included .    during spreading",
    ", the contact line roughens due to the quenched disorder of the substrate , a phenomenon analyzed extensively in the literature @xcite , also in the context of the hysteresis for advancing and receding contact lines @xcite .",
    "when disorder becomes relevant the interface dynamics enters a critical regime where pinning occurs , and the interface propagates through avalanches .",
    "this regime is characterized by a force @xmath47 , at which an interface becomes pinned . around @xmath47 ,",
    "the contact line develops local self - affine fluctuations ( roughness ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the length of the interface and @xmath50 the roughness exponent specific to contact line motion @xcite .",
    "the propagation of the interface by avalanche is characterized by a series a correlation lengths and critical exponents . during the avalanche , a portion of the avalanche , with lateral size @xmath51 , moves by a distance @xmath52 .",
    "the duration @xmath53 of the interface is characterized by the dynamical exponent @xmath54 .",
    "the lateral extent of the avalanches is a correlation length related to the driving force @xmath55 and the pinning force @xmath47 by the critical exponent @xmath56 : @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the velocity of the interface scales as @xmath58 .",
    "critical scaling implies that @xmath59 and , for non - local elastic interface , @xmath60 .",

    "this distribution is characterized by its width which decays with the interfacial length and depends only on the strength of the disorder , measured by the prefactor of the disorder two - point correlation function @xcite .",
    "although a complete solution of roughening requires additional non - linear terms , eq .",

    "@xmath65 , the elastic restoring force dominates while disorder dominates for @xmath66 .",
    "the contact angle @xmath67 at which pinning first becomes relevant is then obtained by balancing the spreading power ( eq .",

    "to first order in @xmath69 , @xmath70 through volume conservation ( using @xmath15 ) , this translates to a pinning radius @xmath71 the volume of the droplet thus plays a crucial role .",
    "large droplets will enter the pinning regime already close to equilibrium while , for smaller droplets , the ratio @xmath72 can be much smaller than 1 , even more so for strong wetting @xmath73 .",
    "we now consider spreading on a disordered substrate .",
    "the case of a contracting droplet ( for equilibrium contact angles in excess of @xmath74 ) is an easy extension not reported here .",

    "the likelihood @xmath92 that the droplet radius will at least be @xmath8 is obtained from a probabilistic argument , an approach also used for indentation crack propagation @xcite .",
    "the motion of the droplet ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) consists of a succession of steps over independent configurations of the pinning disorder - ie .",
    "the distance covered is divided into uncorrelated increments .",
    "the size of the steps can be inferred from the critical dynamics of the contact line motion .",
    "after step @xmath93 , during the sequence of jumps , the pinned contact line explores the combined potential ( elastic plus disorder ) over a distance @xmath94 , finding a configuration that tend to minimize its energy . upon depinning ( ie .",

    "a droplet will thus reach a given @xmath23 if it has passed through all the previous pinning zones without being stopped .",

    "the size of the droplet is thus implicitly present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist ] ) .    to analyze the results , it is convenient to set @xmath111 .",
    "the relevant dimensionless ratios are then @xmath72 , a measure of the influence of disorder strength , droplet volume and equilibrium wetting properties , and @xmath112 , which relates the droplet typical size to the spatial structure of the disorder .",
    "these ratios are made apparent from the limit @xmath113 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist ] ) which reads @xmath114 the probability for the droplet to reach a given @xmath8 thus decays quickly close to @xmath76 .",
    "this decay is sharper for drops that are large compared to the disorder scale ( @xmath115 ) than for smaller drops .",
    "this tendency to cluster around @xmath76 drastically increases as the ratio @xmath116 , which occurs for weak disorder or very large drops .    the importance of the ratio @xmath117 is clearly shown in figure [ fig2 ] , where the probability to reach a radius @xmath8 as calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dist ] ) is shown for various ratios @xmath117 and @xmath72 . for values",
    "@xmath118 , this probability drops sharply and the drop remains essentially pinned at a radius @xmath76 .",
    "it is only for relatively small values of this ratio that the probability to reach a radius larger than @xmath76 increases significantly . in other words , occasionally for small droplets the spreading can get closer to the equilibrium radius .",
    "the effect of disorder on the values of contact angles at pinning can then be elaborated by comparing the predicted value to @xmath10 using volume conservation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : volume ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the average contact angles calculated from the theory for two values of @xmath10 . at large values of the ratio @xmath112",
    ", the final value of the contact angle is essentially determined by the value of @xmath76 , ie .",
    ", strong disorder , characterized by a small ratio @xmath72 leads to a larger apparent contact angle .",
    "in such a case , it is only for a small value of the ratio @xmath112 that the apparent contact angle can be quantitatively close to the expected @xmath10 .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show for three different disorder ( @xmath119 ) values how @xmath72 itself scales for various contact angles and a fixed @xmath51 taken to be 10 micrometers .",
    "the values of @xmath119 are taken to have representative values ; note that the parameter measures the relative variation of the surface energy due to chemical disorder or due to roughness .",
    "out of a variety of cases , we depict nine representative ones to show the trends .",
    "figure [ fig4]a shows the actual droplet volumes at hand for each contact angle and disorder , while figure [ fig4]b shows the ratios of the pinning radius to the equilibrium one .",
    "the trends themselves are obvious ( larger contact angles lessen the effect of pinning , while stronger disorder works to the other direction ) , and the final prediction is then to be computed similarly to figure [ fig3 ] for all the cases , separately .",
    "it is thus interesting to note that the wetting properties of the surface , present through @xmath10 also enter explicitly the problem through the values of @xmath76 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is in contrast with wenzel law or cassie law which relate the apparent contact angles to the equilibrium contact angle through a set of constants independent of the nature of the surface or of the liquid . for naturally wetting surfaces ( @xmath120 )",
    ", wenzel law predicts that the apparent contact angle is _ larger _ than the equilibrium contact angle",
    ". this however neglects the fact that spreading is a dynamical process and that pinning of the contact line impedes the droplet from reaching an equilibrium state .",
    "the temporal aspects of the radial pinning process can be obtained from the relation between the interface velocity and the driving force in the critical regime .",

    "[ fig5 ] and shows that that the time to reach a given @xmath131 increases as a function of @xmath72 , particularly for @xmath8 close to @xmath12 .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a statistical physics theory of droplet asymptotic contact angles on heterogeneous surfaces .",
    "this allows us to identify the important quantities , such as the first pinning radius @xmath76 and the ratios to the disorder scale and the equilibrium radius , @xmath72 and @xmath117 .",
    "the theory presented here applies to droplets with typical lengths above the nanometer scale , such that line tension effects are irrelevant .",
    "it is also important that radius variations are smaller than the radius of the droplet , for it to keep a compact circular shape on average .",
    "this last requirement implies that the disorder length scale @xmath132 .",
    "the contact line dynamics model loses its validity in certain cases - one example is when long - range microscopic forces make it invalid , or when the presence of features such as corrugations make it so that the coarse - grained surface tension indirectly assumed is not present .",
    "our results predict a dependence of the average contact angle on the volume of the droplet . at constant disorder strength",
    ", we expect small droplets to exhibit a markedly larger contact angle at pinning than larger droplets , even more so when the droplet is large with respect to the spatial scale of the disorder .",
    "the predictions of the theory can be easily tested through repeated spreading experiments using droplets of different volumes on the same substrate , so that the first pinning radius @xmath76 ( cf . , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rp ] ) ) only depends on the drop volume .",
    "it is also possible to test the theory using different liquids on a given surface .",
    "large variations of the apparent contact angle due to the final stage of spreading are expected for small droplets .",
    "many of the consequences of the theory of elastic manifolds are in contrast to static , energy - minimization based results as the wenzel or cassie - baxter laws .",
    "further theoretical developments include extending the theory presented in this paper to receding radii on hydrophobic surfaces and to develop similar arguments for a structured surface on which gas phase pockets can develop .",
    "it is also clear that the theory can be tested through large scale numerical simulations of the relevant hydrodynamics equations .",
    "extending the probabilistic argument to the finite - temperature very - long time creep motion regime , relevant for contact lines as elastic manifolds , is also possible .",
