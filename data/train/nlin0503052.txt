    "in the semiclassical limit , fully chaotic quantum systems display universal properties .",
    "universal behavior has been observed for many quantities of interest in such different areas as mesoscopic transport or nuclear physics .",
    "one paradigmatic example stands out and will be the object of our investigation : according to the bohigas - giannoni - schmit ( bgs ) conjecture put forward about two decades ago @xcite , highly excited energy levels of generic fully chaotic systems have universal spectral statistics .",
    "this conjecture is supported by broad experimental and numerical evidence @xcite .",
    "level statistics can be characterized by the so - called spectral form factor .",
    "the level density @xmath3 of a bounded quantum system ( @xmath4 denoting the energy levels ) is split into a local average @xmath5 and an oscillatory part @xmath6 describing fluctuations around that average .",
    "the form factor is defined as the fourier transform of the two - point correlator @xmath7 w.r.t .",
    "the energy difference @xmath8 , @xmath9 here the time @xmath1 , conjugate to the energy difference , is measured in units of the so - called heisenberg time @xmath10 with @xmath11 denoting the volume of the energy shell and @xmath12 the number of freedoms . since the study of high - lying states justifies the semiclassical limit , we may take @xmath13 , for fixed @xmath1 . to make @xmath0 a plottable function , two averages , @xmath14 in ( [ def_formfac ] ) , are necessary , like over windows of the center energy @xmath15 and a small time interval @xmath16 .",
    "given full chaos , @xmath0 is found to have a universal form , as obtained by averaging over certain _ ensembles _ of random matrices @xcite . in the absence of geometric symmetries , the prediction of random - matrix theory ( rmt ) only depends on whether the system in question has no time - reversal ( @xmath17 ) invariance ( unitary case ) , or is @xmath17 invariant with either @xmath18 ( orthogonal case ) or @xmath19 ( symplectic case ) .",
    "rmt yields for @xmath20 @xmath21 however , a proof of the faithfulness of individual chaotic dynamics to random - matrix theory , and even the assumptions required for a proof , have thus far remained a challenge . in the present paper , we take up the challenge and derive the small-@xmath1 expansion of @xmath0 for _ individual _ systems ; we employ ergodicity and hyperbolicity of the classical dynamics .",
    "moreover , we require all classical relaxation times ( related to ruelle - pollicott resonances and lyapunov exponents ) to be finite ; we need this property to make sure that even the shortest quantum time scale of relevance , the so - called ehrenfest time @xmath22 is much larger than any classical time scale .",
    "following @xcite , we start from gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite which expresses the level density as a sum over classical periodic orbits @xmath23 , @xmath24 wherein @xmath25 is the stability amplitude ( including the maslov phase ) and @xmath26 the action of the @xmath23th orbit . by ( [ gutzwiller ] ) , the form factor becomes a double sum over orbits , @xmath27 @xmath28 is the period of @xmath23 . for @xmath29 , only families of orbit pairs with small action difference @xmath30 can give a systematic contribution to the form factor .",
    "for all others , the phase in ( [ doublesum ] ) oscillates rapidly , and the contribution is killed by the averages indicated .",
    "fluctuations in _ quantum _ spectra are thus related to _ classical _",
    "correlations among orbit actions @xcite .",
    "the first periodic - orbit approach to @xmath0 was taken by berry @xcite , who derived the leading term in ( [ formfactor ] ) using `` diagonal '' pairs of coinciding ( @xmath31 ) and , for time @xmath32-invariant dynamics , mutually time - reversed ( @xmath33 ) orbits , which obviously are identical in action . starting with argaman et al .",
    "@xcite , off - diagonal orbit pairs were studied in @xcite .",
    "the potential importance of close self - encounters in orbit pairs was first spelled out in work on electronic transport @xcite and qualitatively discussed for spectral fluctuations in @xcite .",
    "the family of orbit pairs responsible for the next - to - leading order was definitely identified in sieber s and richter s seminal papers @xcite for a homogeneously hyperbolic system , the hadamard - gutzwiller model ( geodesic motion on a tesselated surface of negative curvature with genus 2 ) .",
    "their original formulation was based on small - angle self - crossings of periodic orbits in configuration space . in each pair ,",
    "the partner @xmath34 differs from @xmath23 only by narrowly avoiding one of its many self - crossings .",
    "the two orbits almost coincide in one of the two parts separated by the crossing , while they are nearly time - reversed in the other part . in phase space ,",
    "both orbits contain an  encounter \" of two almost time - reversed orbit stretches .",
    "they differ only by their connections inside that encounter ; see fig [ fig : sr ] .",
    "as shown in @xcite , sieber s and richter s reasoning can be extended to general fully chaotic two - freedom systems .",
    "one partner orbit @xmath34 arises for each encounter .",
    "the action difference within each orbit pair @xcite can be derived using the geometry of the invariant manifolds @xcite .",
    "it thus turned out helpful to reformulate the treatment in terms of phase - space coordinates @xcite , which may also be applied to systems with more than two freedoms @xcite .    in @xcite , we showed that the @xmath35-contribution to the form factor originates from pairs of orbits which differ either in two encounters of the above kind , or in one encounter that involves _ three _ orbit stretches .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate how the whole series expansion of @xmath0 is obtained from periodic orbits . beyond furnishing details",
    "left out in our previous letter @xcite we here cover systems with more than two freedoms and from all three wigner - dyson symmetry classes . for the symplectic case",
    "we employ ideas presented in @xcite .",
    "for related work on quantum graphs , see @xcite for the first three orders of @xmath0 and @xcite for a complete treatment .",
    "we set out to identify the families of orbit pairs responsible for all orders of the @xmath1-expansion .",
    "the key point is that long orbits have a huge number of close self - encounters which may involve arbitrarily many orbit stretches .",
    "we speak of an @xmath36-encounter whenever @xmath36 stretches of an orbit get  close \" in phase space .  closeness \" will be quantified below such that we may speak of the beginning , the end , and the duration of an encounter .",

    "self - encounters are of interest since they lead us from a periodic orbit @xmath23 to partners @xmath34 which differ from @xmath23 noticeably only inside a set of encounters ( see the dashed orbit in [ fig:24]a ) .",
    "in contrast , the orbit loops in between encounters are almost identical .",
    "the almost coinciding loops of @xmath23 and @xmath34 are differently connected inside the encounters .",

    "[ fig:23 ] .",
    "correspondingly , loops inside mutual partner orbits may be related by time reversal .",

    ", different reconnections inside the same encounter may give rise to different partners , and hence different structures .",
    "we will see that structures have a one - to - one correspondence to permutations , which will be used in section [ sec : combinatorics ] to determine the number @xmath49 of structures related to the same @xmath50 .",
    "orbit pairs sharing the same @xmath50 and the same structure may still differ in the _ phase - space separations _ between the encounter stretches .",

    "the purely combinatorial task of determining the number of structures @xmath57 is attacked in section [ sec : combinatorics ] with the help of the theory of permutations .",

    "we assume @xmath17 to be the conventional time - reversal operator @xmath61 ; that assumption does not restrict generality , since all hamiltonians with non - conventional time - reversal invariance can be brought to conventionally time - reversal invariant form by a suitable canonical transformation @xcite .    for each phase - space point @xmath62 it is possible to define a poincar surface of section @xmath63 orthogonal to the trajectory passing through @xmath64 . assuming a cartesian configuration space ( and thus a cartesian momentum space ) , @xmath63 consists of all points @xmath65 in the same energy shell as @xmath64 whose configuration - space displacement @xmath66 is orthogonal to @xmath67 . for @xmath59",

    "moreover , structures are characterized ( ii ) by the _ relative directions _ of the encounter stretches ( i.e. @xmath37}$ ] or @xmath41 for 2-encounters , and @xmath48 or @xmath40}$ ] for 3-encounters in @xmath17 invariant systems ) , and ( iii ) by the _ reconnections _",

    "one justification was in fact already mentioned : we may imagine the encounter in question generated by shrinking away one external loop from a standard 2-encounter .",
    "another motivation is that of the three close substretches in part @xmath672 ( @xmath693 in the case of @xmath249 revolutions about @xmath670 ) only two are independent ; the third ( the @xmath694 others ) are uniquely determined by two , calculable through the linearized equations of motion .",
    "clearly , if one tries to reconnect ( sub-)stretches of a parallel 2-encounter one does not get an acceptable partner orbit of @xmath23 but a pseudo - orbit .",
    "however , the foregoing discussion carries over to parallel stretches in arbitrary @xmath36-encounters .",
    "for instance , by shrinking away an external loop from a parallel 3-encounter @xmath48 we arrive at fig .",

    "now a partner orbit @xmath34 may arise wherein the dashed stretch has pinched one revolution about @xmath670 from the full one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : por]c ) , a fact we now turn to explain . recall that we can construct a partner orbit by changing connections inside the encounter . to do so , we place a poincar section within the encounter , say in region @xmath673 as in fig . [",
    "fig : por]b . the orbit @xmath23 will pierce through that section in three points ;",
    "the whole of @xmath23 , the external loops included , is thus divided into three parts . to determine the partner @xmath34",
    ", we change the connections between these parts , and thus their ordering .",
    "the change of connections can be interpreted as cutting out one of the parts and reinserting it between the two other parts . in the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : por]b , the merged stretch pierces through @xmath63 twice , and the part of @xmath23 between these piercings is one revolution about @xmath670 .",

    "[ fig : por]c . to translate to symbolic dynamics , we label the two remaining loops of @xmath23 by @xmath697 and @xmath669 such that @xmath698 . the partner orbit @xmath34 has one @xmath699 shifted between the two stretches , i.e. @xmath700 .",
    "it is important to note that the encounter shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : por]b may be represented by three pieces @xmath672 , two from the merged stretch and one from the isolated stretch . in other words",
    ", it suffices to consider a shorter encounter made of three independent traversals of the region @xmath672 .",
    "for example , we may take an encounter consisting of the first and second traversal of @xmath672 by the merged stretch and the latest traversal by the isolated stretch ; these traversals are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : por]d by thick full and dotted lines",
    ". we shall refer to the full 3-encounter and its shorter representative as to the `` long '' and `` short '' one .",
    "the choice of the three representative traversals in the short encounter is not arbitrary .",
    "first , we have to make sure that the encounter is limited by the boundaries of @xmath672 .",
    "for the above example , we easily check that outside these boundaries , at least one of the traversing stretches starts to depart from the others . we have thus identified a shorter 3-encounter whose stretches _ do not overlap_.    second , we want our short encounter to give rise to the same partner orbit as the long one",
    ". to check this , let us place a poincar section somewhere inside @xmath672 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : por]d .",
    "again , the two piercings of the merged stretch are separated by one revolution of @xmath670 , and there is one piercing by the isolated stretch .",
    "just like for the larger encounter , the partner has one revolution of @xmath670 cut out of the merged stretch and reinserted into the isolated one .",
    "both restrictions are fulfilled only for one further short 3-encounter , consisting of the second and third traversal by the merged stretch and the first traversal by the isolated stretch ; see fig . [",
    "fig : por]e .    for a first generalization we drop the above restriction on the length of the `` overlapping part '' within the merged stretch of a parallel 3-encounter .",
    "in general , all three encounter stretches must have the form @xmath701 , @xmath702 , where the overlapping part is given by @xmath703 ( the above case referred to @xmath671 ) .",
    "the merger of two of these reads @xmath689 and executes @xmath249 revolutions about @xmath677 , whereas the isolated stretch remains as @xmath701 and revolves only @xmath694 times .",
    "next , we would like to generalize to parallel @xmath36-encounters with larger @xmath36 .",
    "if two of the stretches involved merge into one , this leaves @xmath704 isolated stretches with symbol sequences as above . as before ,",
    "the partner orbit @xmath34 has one revolution about @xmath699 cut out of the merged stretch and inserted into one of the isolated stretches .",
    "in addition , the ordering of the intervening loops may be changed . finally , given time - reversal invariance , the isolated stretches may also have symbol sequences time - reversed w.r.t . @xmath705 .",
    "for all three generalizations just mentioned , we can identify a shorter encounter without overlap , consisting of @xmath36 traversals of the region @xmath672 , and that shorter representative suffices to get all partner orbits @xmath34 . to do so",
    ", we divide the stretches of the larger encounter in two groups . for each stretch of the first group",
    ", the earliest traversal of @xmath672 will be included in the shorter encounter .",
    "for each stretch of the second group , we choose the latest traversal of @xmath672 .",
    "for the  merged \" stretch also the second traversal of @xmath672 needs to be included ( or the next - to - last , if the merged stretch forms part of the second group ) .",
    "these @xmath36 traversals were chosen such that before the beginning of @xmath672 , the traversals of the first group deviate from the others , while the traversals of the second group do so after the end of @xmath672 .",
    "one further short encounter is built out of the latest traversals by the first group , and the earliest traversals by the second group .",
    "as before , we disregard the long encounter in favor of the shorter ones .",
    "note that the division of stretches in two groups is not arbitrary ; the groups must be chosen to guarantee that the shorter encounters give rise to the same partner as the larger one .",
    "( see @xcite for details , and @xcite for an alternative description of overlap in parallel 3-encounters . )    to sum up , each orbit pair generated by overlapping parallel stretches within some encounter can be thought of as originating from any of _ two _ shorter encounters without overlapping stretches .",
    "one of these two shorter encounters will , in the following subsection , be excluded and a one - to - one correspondence between orbit pairs and encounters will be reestablished , in effect by the condition ( [ strong_min_parallel ] ) for the separation of piercings .",
    "as regards the form factor that condition will turn out semiclassically equivalent to the weaker condition ( [ min_parallel ] ) , i.e. the requirement of non - vanishing loops we had worked with in the main part of this paper .",
    "recall that we define an @xmath36-encounter as a region inside a periodic orbit in which @xmath36 orbit stretches come close up to time reversal . attached to the sides of the encounter",
    "are `` fringes '' in which only some of the @xmath36 stretches remain close while others have already gone astray , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringe]a .",
    "we shall now show that these fringes do not affect the spectral form factor .        as a first example , let us assume that two _ antiparallel _ stretches remain close after the end of the encounter , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringe]a . if there is no intervening loop ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fringe]b ) , the orbit has to undergo an almost self - retracing reflection , just like the one studied in appendix [ sec : retracers ] . since no connections can be switched between the two stretches involved we have to disregard such encounters .",
    "on the other hand , if the  fringe \" stretches are separated by an external loop , a partner orbit is obtained as usual , by reshuffling connections inside the encounter , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fringe]a . to make sure that there is an intervening loop , we impose minimal separations between piercing points , similar to those used for excluding overlap between _ encounters _ in [ sec : statistics ] .",
    "after two antiparallel stretches ( labelled by @xmath99 and @xmath152 ) have pierced through a poincar section @xmath63 with unstable coordinates @xmath706 and @xmath707 , they will remain close for a time @xmath708 .",
    "this duration contains both the time @xmath113 ( [ tu ] ) till the end of the @xmath168-th encounter , and an additional time span _ after _ the end of the encounter , which gives the duration of the fringe .",
    "using the unstable coordinates @xmath709 of piercing through a section in the end of the encounter ( depending on @xmath706 via @xmath710 ) , this additional time may be written as @xmath711 .",

    "are hence revealed as negligible semiclassically .",
    "let us now consider fringes of _ parallel _ encounter stretches . in the absence of intervening loops",
    ", there may be _ different encounters _ yielding the _ same partner orbit _ , like the two short encounters of appendix [ sec : por ] , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : por]d and e. one easily sees that these short encounters do not have their fringes separated by loops .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : por]d , the two full thick stretches remain close after the end of the encounter region @xmath672 , thus forming a fringe .",

    "<S> we argue semiclassically , on the basis of gutzwiller s periodic - orbit theory , that full classical chaos is paralleled by quantum energy spectra with universal spectral statistics , in agreement with random - matrix theory . for dynamics from all three wigner - dyson symmetry classes , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the small - time spectral form factor @xmath0 as power series in the time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> each term @xmath2 of that series is provided by specific families of pairs of periodic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> the contributing pairs are classified in terms of close self - encounters in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of occurrence of self - encounters is calculated by invoking ergodicity . </S>",
    "<S> combinatorial rules for building pairs involve non - trivial properties of permutations . </S>",
    "<S> we show our series to be equivalent to perturbative implementations of the non - linear sigma models for the wigner - dyson ensembles of random matrices and for disordered systems ; our families of orbit pairs are one - to - one with feynman diagrams known from the sigma model . </S>"
