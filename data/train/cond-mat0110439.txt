    "inelastic light - scattering ( raman ) experiments reveal a two - particle response of interacting electrons in a similar way as infrared spectroscopy hence combining advantages of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , by allowing momentum resolution , and of conductivity measurements .",
    "raman studies of the electron properties in cuprates have already been carried out for various doping levels in samples of bi@xmath0sr@xmath0(y@xmath1ca@xmath2)cu@xmath0o@xmath3 ( bi-2212 ) , yba@xmath0cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( y-123 ) , and la@xmath8sr@xmath2cuo@xmath9 ( lsco ) @xcite . however , there are still many unclarified issues as well as considerable improvements in sample quality which motivate a detailed analysis of electronic properties below and above @xmath10 with doping @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , for the understanding of superconductivity in the cuprates the properties of the normal state are considered to be as crucial as those below @xmath10 since the relevant interactions have a characteristic influence on the carriers at all temperatures .    through the choice of the incident and scattered polarization vectors ,",
    "raman scattering is sensitive to different portions of the fermi surface . by selecting the incident and",
    "scattered light polarizations parallel to @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being parallel to the cu - o bonds , the b@xmath5 symmetry is projected out . in this case the excitations with momenta along the diagonals of the brillouin zone ( bz ) are mainly probed . with polarizations along @xmath14 ( at 45@xmath15 to the cu - o bonds ) the b@xmath4 symmetry is selected .",
    "then the excitation probed are those with momenta along the bz axes .",
    "in this paper we report electronic raman scattering measurements in b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 polarization geometries at different doping levels in the superconducting and in the normal state .",
    "for @xmath16 the data are analyzed in terms of the memory function approach recently introduced to extract dynamical relaxation rates of the carriers @xcite .",
    "high quality bi@xmath0sr@xmath0(y@xmath1ca@xmath2)cu@xmath0o@xmath3 single crystals were prepared in zro crucibles .",
    "they cover a wide doping range as summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the doping level @xmath11 is calculated from the relation @xmath17 $ ] @xcite .",
    ".bi-2212 single crystals studied . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the experiments were performed in pseudo back - scattering geometry using a standard raman setup and an ar@xmath18 laser for excitation at 458 nm , 514 nm and 528 nm , and a kr@xmath18 laser at 647 nm . to reduce the heating of the sample due to the absorbed radiation , the power of the laser",
    "was maintained below 4 mw .",
    "the temperatures given below are corrected for the laser - induced heating as estimated from the ratio of the stokes to the anti - stokes intensities .",
    "the measured spectra are divided by the bose - einstein factor to display the raman response @xmath19 .",
    "fig .  [ doping ] shows the b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 electronic raman spectra in differently doped bi-2212 samples in the superconducting state at approximately 10 k and in the normal state at approximately 90 k. the data are plotted as a function of energy normalized to the respective transition temperatures of the samples to better visualize the scaling of relevant energies with @xmath10 .",
    "the superconductivity - induced features in b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 symmetries show a very different scaling behavior with the carrier concentration .",
    "we will discuss first the b@xmath4 symmetry results . as the carrier concentration decreases from overdoped , fig .",
    "[ doping](a ) , to underdoped , fig .",
    "[ doping](e ) , the b@xmath4 spectrum undergoes substantial modifications .",
    "in particular , the intensity is strongly suppressed when reducing the doping level , and for @xmath20 there is no evidence of superconductivity - induced features ( fig .",
    "[ doping](e ) ) , since there is no observable difference between the superconducting and the normal state spectra .",
    "the energy of the superconductivity - induced feature @xmath21 , is also strongly affected by doping , going from @xmath22 in the most overdoped sample ( fig .",
    "[ doping](a ) ) to @xmath23 in the slightly underdoped one ( fig .",
    "[ doping](d ) ) . from these observations",
    "we conclude that , in the doping range studied , the peak energy is not proportional to @xmath24 but decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noticing that we observe the same doping dependence in y-123 samples @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the b@xmath5 spectra show a superconductivity - induced feature at all doping levels as it is evident from fig .  [ doping](f ) to fig .",
    "[ doping](l ) .",
    "in addition , the maxima of the superconducting spectra @xmath25 are roughly constant between 6 and 6.5 , with the exception of the the most overdoped sample ( fig .  [ doping](f ) ) .    assuming the superconducting gap to vary as @xmath26 , it is possible to extract the maximum @xmath27 @xcite . in the b@xmath5 symmetry the measured spectra support @xmath27 scaling with @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the effects of superconductivity are observable up to an energy @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ doping ] ) , where the superconducting and normal spectra merge , which again scales with @xmath10 , both in b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 symmetries , at any doping level studied .",
    "the scaling of @xmath27 with @xmath10 is consistent with the results for the superconducting energy gap derived from the magnetic penetration depth @xcite , electron tunneling for low bias voltages well below the gap @xcite , as well as andreev reflection measurement @xcite .",
    "however , if the b@xmath4 peak energy @xmath29 is considered , raman scattering seems to reveal an additional energy scale which increases monotonically when decreasing the doping level .",
    "this can not be explained in the framework of a simple @xmath30-wave superconducting energy gap , consistently with the b@xmath5 symmetry and requires further theoretical work .",
    "in addition , the doping dependence of @xmath21 resembles that of the energy scale probed by arpes and tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that there are two relevant energy scales , namely the single - particle excitation energy , probed by arpes and tunneling spectroscopies , which increases by decreasing the doping , and a coherence energy scale , obtained for example by andreev reflections or b@xmath5 raman scattering @xcite .",
    "these two energies approach the same value at high doping levels , where the material is believed to recover a bcs - like behavior , and become increasingly different at low dopings .",
    "the interpretation of these energy scales and their relation is still an unsolved question .",
    "however , to clearly address these questions more experiments are required to investigate the @xmath21 scaling behavior in the underdoped side of the phase diagram and at which dopings the pair - breaking peak disappears in the b@xmath4 symmetry .    in order to further investigate the superconductivity - induced features , we have studied the spectra of the three overdoped bi-2212 samples at different excitation energies . in fact",
    ", it has been previously argued that resonance properties of the pair - breaking excitations are observable in highly overdoped bi-2212 samples in b@xmath4 symmetry , and that they are possibly a signature of an antiferromagnetically correlated fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the electronic contribution for excitation energies between 1.6 ev and 2.7 ev in b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 scattering geometries .",
    "[ wavelength ] shows the raman intensity in the b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 symmetries for three overdoped bi-2212 samples . in all cases the overall spectra at wavelengths @xmath31 nm have been multiplied by a factor , ranging from 0.7 to 2 , to adjust the intensity at 800 - 1000 @xmath32 to the spectra at @xmath33 nm . in both configurations we do not find any significant variation of the lineshape of the spectra with excitation energy at any doping level .",
    "however , we observe a reduction of the overall intensity in the b@xmath5 symmetry upon decreasing photon energies .",
    "hence , we can not observe a specific variation of the pair breaking feature with excitation energy neither in bi-2212 nor in y-123 , except for a small change in the overall cross section .",
    "the raman continua in the normal state , @xmath34 , ( see e.g. fig . [ doping ] ) contain information on the dynamical two particle lifetime @xmath35 for different regions in @xmath36-space . in fig .",
    "[ rates ] we show the relaxation rates @xmath37 for two bi-2212 samples with @xmath11=0.20 and @xmath11=0.23 , derived as described in @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the phonons have already been subtracted out .    both in @xmath38 , fig .",
    "[ rates](a , b ) , and @xmath39 , fig .",
    "[ rates](c , d ) , symmetries , the variation with frequency of the quasiparticle relaxation rates show only little dependence on momentum and doping . as compared to results at lower doping level @xcite ,",
    "there is a tendency to a more quadratic frequency dependence below approximately 400 @xmath32 in the b@xmath4 symmetry possibly indicating more conventional quasiparticle dynamics .    the dependence of the dc limit of the relaxation rates @xmath40 on temperature evolves differently with doping in the two symmetries analyzed . in particular , while @xmath41 decreases with temperature at all doping levels in the b@xmath5 symmetry , consistently with ordinary and optical transport @xcite , @xmath42 is constant or slightly decreasing with @xmath43 for @xmath11=0.20 and assumes the b@xmath5 behavior at @xmath44 .",
    "this disappearance of the anisotropy in the small doping range between 0.20 and 0.22 is directly visible in fig .",
    "[ rates ] , where the @xmath45 sample shows a strongly suppressed relaxation rate in the b@xmath4 symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ rates](b ) ) .",
    "we thus believe that the fundamental change in the carrier dynamics close to @xmath46 is an intrinsic property of the electron system itself and is closely related to correlation effects which are found to fade away in this doping range in several other experiments @xcite .",
    "this implies that the underlying interactions , ordering phenomena , and/or fluctuations must have some structure in momentum space .",
    "we presented electronic raman scattering results on bi-2212 . in the sc state ,",
    "the b@xmath4 and b@xmath5 symmetry spectra are characterized by very different doping dependences of the superconductivity - induced features .",
    "while the b@xmath5 spectra are consistent with a superconducting energy gap with @xmath30-wave symmetry and a maximum @xmath27 scaling with @xmath10 , the b@xmath4 symmetry requires further theoretical work . in the normal state",
    "the quasiparticles at @xmath46 and at @xmath47 are characterized by a qualitatively different doping dependence of the relaxation rates . at high doping levels , @xmath44 ,",
    "the anisotropy observed for @xmath48seems to disappear ."
