    "<S> we construct the infinite sequence of invariants for curves in surfaces by using word theory that v. turaev introduced . for plane closed curves , we add some extra terms , e.g. the rotation number . from these modified invariants , we get the arnold s basic invariants and some other invariants </S>",
    "<S> . we also express how these invariants classify plane closed curves . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider other classes of plane curves : long curves and fronts . </S>"
