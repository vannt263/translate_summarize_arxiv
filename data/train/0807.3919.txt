    "gravitational topological objects may have been formed in the early universe during its phase expansion due to spontaneously symmetry braking @xcite .",
    "depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold , @xmath2 , these are domain walls , strings , monopoles and texture , corresponding to the homotopy groups @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "global monopoles are heavy topological objects formed in the phase transition of a system composed by a self - coupling iso - triplet scalar field , @xmath7 , whose original global @xmath8 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath9 .",
    "the scalar matter field plays the role of an order parameter which outside the monopole s core acquires a non - vanishing value . the global monopole was first introduced by sokolov and starobinsky in @xcite , and its gravitational effects have been analyzed by barriola and vilenkin @xcite . in @xcite , has been shown that for points far away from the monopole s center the geometry of the spacetime can be given by the following line element : @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 , smaller than unity , depends on the energy scale @xmath12 where the global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the spacetime described by ( [ gm ] ) has a non - vanishing scalar curvature , @xmath13 , and the solid angle of a sphere of unit radius is smaller than the usual one , presenting in this way , a solid angle deficit : @xmath14 .",
    "although the geometric properties of the spacetime outside the monopole are very well understood , the analysis of the metric tensor in the region inside requires the complete knowledge of the energy - momentum tensor associated with the scalar field , @xmath15 , which on the other hand depends on the knowledge of the components of the metric tensor , providing , in this way , a non solvable integral equation @xcite . because of this fact , many interesting investigations of physical effects associated with global monopole consider this object as a point - like defect . in this way",
    ", it is considered that the geometry of the whole spacetime is described by ( [ gm ] ) ; however , adopting this model , calculations of vacuum polarization effects , for example , present divergences on the monopole s core .",
    "one of most interesting phenomenon associated with the gravitational topological defects , is related with the induced self - energy on an electric charged particle placed at rest in their neighborhood .",
    "this effect has been analysed in an idealized cosmic string spacetime by linet @xcite and smith @xcite , independently , and in the spacetime of a point - like global monopole in @xcite . in these analysis , the induced self - energies present divergences on the respective defects core . in order to avoid this problem , a more realistic model for the defects should take into account a inner structure for them . as to cosmic string",
    ", two different models have been adopted to describe the geometry inside it : the ballpoint - pen model proposed independently by gott and hiscock @xcite , replaces the conical singularity at the string axis by a constant curvature spacetime in the interior region , and flower - pot model @xcite , presents the curvature concentrated on a ring with the spacetime inside the string been flat .",
    "khusnutdinov and bezerra in @xcite , revisited the induced electrostatic self - energy problem considering the hiscock and gott model for the region inside the string . recently",
    "the electrostatic self - energy problem in the context of global monopole has been analyzed considering the flower - pot model @xcite for the region inside . in order to complete the analysis of electrostatic self - energy in the global monopole spacetime ,",
    "the propose of this paper is to consider the ballpoint - pen model for the region inside .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect1 ] is presented the model adopted to describe the spacetime in the region inside the global monopole and some its geometric properties . in section [ sect2 ] , we write the maxwell equations in the corresponding spacetime , and derive the green function for points outside and inside to the monopole s core . in section [ sect3 ]",
    "we calculate the corresponding renormalized induced electrostatic self - energy , and give its behavior in various asymptotic regions of the parameters . in section [ sect4 ]",
    "we present our conclusions and more relevant remarks .",
    "the simplest model which gives rise to a global monopole has been proposed by barriola and vilenkin @xcite , and is described by a lagrangian whose original @xmath8 global gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath9 .",
    "the influence of this object on the geometry of the spacetime can be analysed by coupling the energy - momentum tensor associated with this matter field with einstein equations .",
    "barriola and vilenkin have shown that for points very far away form the monopole s center , the spacetime is described by the line element ( [ gm ] ) . although there are no analytical solutions for the metric tensors in the inner region , harari and loust @xcite presented a simplified version for the geometry in this region .",
    "they have shown that it can be represented by a de sitter spacetime , whose constant scalar curvature is proportional to the energy scale @xmath12 where the symmetry is broken .",
    "although this model shares the main features of the exact solution , the analysis of the three - dimensional green function in the region inside the monopole is a very difficult task . another model which also shares some features with the exact solution and allows us to obtain closed solutions for this function is the ballpoint - pen model .",
    "this model is given as shown below :    * for the region outside the monopole the metric of the spacetime is given by ( [ gm ] ) , where the radial coordinates is defined in the interval @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the radius of the monopole . * for inner region",
    "the metric tensor is given by the following line element @xmath18 with the new radial coordinate defined in the interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the inner solution can match the exterior solution without the necessity to include an infinitely thin shell at the boundary , provided the junction conditions below : @xmath20    in the inner region , the non zero components of the riemann and ricci tensors and scalar curvature are : @xmath21    it is possible to describe the metric tensor in the inner region by using the radial @xmath22 coordinate through the relation @xmath23 in this case , the line element ( [ gm1 ] ) can be written by @xmath24 where @xmath25",
    "with the objective to construct the green function associated with an electric charged particle at rest in the spacetime of a global monopole , we write down the maxwell equation in an arbitrary curved spacetime @xmath26 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the four - vector potential and current , respectively . for a point - like particle at rest with",

    "we assume that @xmath48 is regular at the core center , @xmath49 goes to zero at infinity , and that these solutions are normalized by the wronskian relation @xmath50moreover , both solutions must be regular with their first radial derivative regular at the boundary , i.e. , @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    in the region outside the core",

    "the green function is given by substituting ( [ g3 ] ) into ( [ green - b ] ) , the result is : @xmath80 being @xmath81 also , this function presents two contributions : the first one , @xmath82 , is the green function in the background geometry described by the line element ( [ gm1 ] ) using the external radial coordinate , and the second , @xmath83 , is due to the geometry of global monopole for @xmath84 .",
    "according to @xcite , the induced electrostatic self - energy associated with the electric charge is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the renormalized green function defined as @xmath87 being @xmath88 the hadamard function .",
    "the general expression for the hadamard function in a three - dimensional space is @xmath89 where @xmath90 , the van vleck - morette determinant , is given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 the geodesic interval between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    because the self - energy depends only on the radial coordinates ,",
    "the respective induced self - force is given by @xmath95    in the rest of this section we shall calculate the induced electrostatic self - energy for the two cases specified : @xmath96 for the charge outside the monopole , and @xmath97 for the charge inside it .",
    "as we have seen , for the region outside the monopole s core the green function to be considered in the calculation of the self - energy is given by ( [ ap ] ) . according to ( [ se ] )",
    ", the induced electrostatic self - energy is given by taking the coincidence limit of the renormalized green function .",
    "we observe that for points with @xmath84 , the core induced part of this function is finite in the coincidence limit , and that the divergent contribution appears only in the point - like part only .",
    "so , in the renormalization procedure the only part to be considered is @xmath98 : @xmath99 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the coincidence limit , let us first take @xmath100 , so , for points along the radial distance , the singular part of the hadamard function reads , @xmath101 now , by using @xmath102 given in ( [ ap ] ) , we have : @xmath103 ,   \\label{gmren1}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 . in order to evaluate the limit on the right hand side of the above equation",

    "the core - induced part is divergent at the boundary , @xmath131 . in order to verify this singular behavior",
    "it is sufficient to analyse this quantity for large values of @xmath117 . the asymptotic expression for ( [ gamma ] )",
    "can be obtained by using the relation between legendre function and hypergeometric one @xcite , @xmath132 for the case under consideration @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "for large value of @xmath117 the leading term of the corresponding hypergeometric function is the unity ( see @xcite ) , and we can write @xmath135 on the other hand @xmath136 .",
    "so after some additional steps we find @xmath137 and we can see that the electrostatic self - energy is dominated by the core - induced part . the analysis of the behavior of the complete self - interaction can only be provided numerically .",
    "so , in in figure [ fig1 ] we have plotted @xmath138 as function of the parameter @xmath116 and @xmath139 .      in order to develop the analysis of the self - energy in the region inside the monopole , we should consider the corresponding green function given in ( [ bl ] ) .",
    "as in the previous analysis , the core - induced contribution of this function is finite at the coincidence limit for @xmath140 . the only divergent contribution in this limit comes from @xmath141 .",
    "the hadmard function , in the region inside the monopole , needed to renormalize this green function can be given in a simple way by using the coordinate system defined in ( [ gm1 ] ) .",
    "taking the coincidence limit in the angular variables first , this function reads : @xmath142 because we have obtained the green function ( [ bl ] ) in the coordinate system defined in ( [ gm2 ] ) , it is more convenient to express the above hadamard function in this system .",
    "so by using ( [ rela ] ) the singular behavior of ( [ hada ] ) is @xmath143 finally the renormalized green function is given by @xmath144 \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so developing some intermediate steps , we obtain the following expression for @xmath145 : we present the explicit calculation adopted to obtain ( [ gr0 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath146 where @xmath147 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath148    now we are in position to write the electrostatic self - energy for a charged particle inside the monopole s core : @xmath149    as in the case of exterior region , the self - energy is positive for @xmath150 and negative for @xmath151 .",
    "the corresponding self - force is obtained by using ( [ sfo ] ) , and is repulsive with respect to the boundary of the monopole core in the first case and attractive in the second case . near the core s center",
    "the most relevant contribution comes from the @xmath121 component of the core - induced contribution . in this region",
    "the self - energy behaves as @xmath152 also the core - induced term diverges at the at the boundary . in order to see that let us analyse this terms for large value of @xmath117 . in this limit",
    "we can verify that @xmath153 and @xmath154 substituting these expressions and developing some additional steps we find @xmath155    finally in figure [ fig2 ] we present the complete behavior of @xmath138 as function of the parameter @xmath116 and @xmath156 .",
    "the induced electrostatic self - energy associated with a charged particle placed at rest in the global monopole spacetime , considering it as a point - like topological defect , is divergent at the center of the object @xcite . in principle",
    "this undesirable result can be avoided by considering a more realistic model for its core . with this objective in mind , in @xcite",
    "we investigated the influence of a non - trivial structure for the monopole s core on the self - energy considering the flower - pot model for the region inside .",
    "for this case the corresponding induced self - energy is expressed in term of two distinct contributions : one coming from the geometry background of the corresponding spacetime , @xmath157 , and the other induced by the boundary , @xmath158 . in order to continue in the same line of investigation , in this paper we decided to revisit the induced electrostatic self - interaction problem , considering at this time a more sophisticated model for the inner structure of the monopole : the ballpoint - pen model .",
    "analogously with happens in the flower - pot model , the renormalized electrostatic self - energy presents two distinct contributions : @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "as it was mentioned the introduction , there is no exact solution for the field equations in the region inside the global monopole .",
    "the de sitter model proposed in @xcite describes the geometry for points very close to the monopole s center . as to the model adopted in this paper , like the de sitter one",
    ", it presents a constant scalar curvature .",
    "moreover , we can verify that it is an exact solution for the einstein equation for the matter field energy - momentum tensor given bellow : @xmath159    admitting this model , were able to obtain the renormalized self - interaction in a closed form , and analyzed it for different positions of the charge , and in various asymptotic regions of the parameters . specifically as to the self - energy at the monopole s center , we found a finite result .    combining this result",
    "with the previous one found in @xcite , we can see that attributing a non - trivial structure for the monopole , the behavior of the self - energy changes drastically , mainly near the boundary and the monopole s center .",
    "before to finish this section , we would like to mention that , although the contributions due to the geometry background and boundary , are different for the flower - pot and ballpoint - pen models , we observe that they share some similarities : the respective induced self - forces are repulsive with respect to the boundary for @xmath150 and attractive for @xmath151 , the self - energy is finite at the monopole s center , and the core - induced contributions are dominant near the boundaries .",
    "in fact they are logarithmically divergent , presenting exactly the same expressions for the outer regions .",
