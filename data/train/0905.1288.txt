    "<S> these groups are obtained as projective images of residual modular galois representations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , families of modular forms are constructed such that the images of all their residual galois representations are as large as a priori possible . </S>",
    "<S> both results essentially use khare s and wintenberger s notion of good - dihedral primes . </S>",
    "<S> particular care is taken in order to exclude nontrivial inner twists .    </S>",
