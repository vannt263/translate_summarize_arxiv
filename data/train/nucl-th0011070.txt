    "the study of @xmath0 meson photoproduction becomes more and more attractive in both experiment and theory .",
    "however , within a long period , only few data were available from abbhhm  @xcite and ahhm  @xcite . according to those results , it was difficult to even establish the feature of the resonance excitations .",
    "this situation challenged theoretical attempts to study @xmath0 photoproduction , @xmath4 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a hadronic model was proposed with a single resonance @xmath10 excited in this reaction , which thus accounted for the possible strong peak near threshold . however , the roles of those low - lying resonances in this reaction have not been explained .",
    "a more self - consistent attempt was made by li  @xcite through a quark model approach based on the assumption that the @xmath0 meson couples to the constituent quark _ via _ the same pseudovector coupling as that of the @xmath11 .",
    "although the available data at that time did not permit detailed investigation of this channel , the author showed that a strong peak near threshold could be produced by the low - lying resonances , especially dominated by the @xmath5 .",
    "meanwhile , a small bump around @xmath12 gev , which comes from the @xmath9 resonance excitations , was predicted .",
    "however , in that work , two resonances , @xmath7 and @xmath13 , which are close to the @xmath0 production threshold , had not been included as little was known about them from ref .",
    "we are left with questions about the role played by these two resonances and more interestingly , whether the @xmath4 can provide signals for the existences of these two resonances .",
    "this is related to the motivation of searching for  missing resonances \" in the meson photoproductions . to answer such questions ,",
    "more precise measurements for this reaction are needed .    the recently published data from the saphir collaboration  @xcite brought the possibility of further systematical study of the resonance excitations in @xmath4 .",
    "with the photon energy covering a range from threshold ( 1.45 gev ) to 2.6 gev for the first time , the resonance excitations were established experimentally in @xmath0 meson photoproduction .",
    "the steep rise and fall of the total cross section near threshold indicated the dominance of resonance excitations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resonance structure was explained as due to two resonance excitations ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "such a prescription led to the arbitary assumption that low - lying resonance effects could be completely neglected , and risked overlooking influences of small cross sections to the angular distributions .",
    "as an example , we recall that in the study of @xmath11 meson photo- and electro - production , the small contribution from the @xmath16 produces significant effects which result in the deviation of the angular distributions from the dominant @xmath17-wave in the low energies .",
    "moreover , resonances other than the @xmath14 and @xmath15 have masses very close to the @xmath0 production threshold , such as the @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , one should also include their threshold effects in this reaction .",
    "based on the above considerations , we believe that a self - consistent treatment to systematically include all the resonances in the @xmath4 reaction is required , and the quark model provides an ideal starting point  @xcite .    in this work , we follow the same scheme as in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the @xmath0 photoproduction at tree level in the quark model .",
    "there are a number of new features in this work : 1 ) the electromagnetic interaction is expanded to @xmath2 , which will partly account for the relativistic corrections beyond the nrcqm .",
    "2 ) two resonances , @xmath7 and @xmath13 , which are attributed to representation @xmath18 $ ] , have been included .",
    "these two resonances are not well determined experimentally . in @xmath4 , we expect that some signals for these two resonances can be clarified .",
    "3 ) in this study , the equal velocity frame ( evf ) is adopted for the lorentz boost  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the evf can boost the particle momentum close to a realistic value .",
    "an _ ad hoc _ form factor is avoided in the evf for the spatial integrals .",
    "4 ) the new data have better contraints to the nucleon pole terms , that sheds light on the @xmath1 coupling constant from the quark model .",
    "5 ) in addition to the study of the differential and total cross sections , the beam polarization asymmetry is predicted , which can be tested by the forthcoming data from graal and jlab in the near future .    in section",
    "ii , a brief introduction to this model is given .",
    "results and analysis are presented in section iii .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the @xmath1 interaction is introduced at quark level through the effective lagrangian for the quark - meson vertex  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) represents the @xmath22th quark ( anti - quark ) field in the nucleon , and @xmath23 is the meson field .",
    "it is still not elementarily clear if the @xmath0 couples to the nucleon through a pseudoscalar or pseudovector coupling , or even both .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the operators for the pseudoscalar and pseudovector coupling have the same leading order expression at quark level .",
    "we take the assumption that the @xmath1 coupling satisfies the goldberger - treiman relation , which means that we can relate the quark - meson coupling to the @xmath1 coupling through @xmath24 the coupling @xmath25 is treated as a parameter that will be determined by the experimental data .",

    "[ s11-transverse ] has been rigorously expanded to order @xmath2 . in other words ,",

    "we even adopt the quark model parameters in the @xmath11 production here , i.e. the harmonic oscillator strength @xmath52 mev and @xmath53 mev .",
    "the main decay channels of the @xmath5 are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for which the branching ratios 0.45 and 0.55 are adopted , respectively .",
    "these values are the same as derived in the @xmath11 meson production  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that at high energies the phase space will permit small branching ratio for a off - shell resonance decaying into higher mass channels .",
    "this feature will change the on - shell branching ratio values accordingly .",
    "however , at leading order , the influences from such deviations are negligibly small . within a wide energy regions , the energy - dependence of the total decay width",
    "is still dominated by decay of the lower mass channels .",
    "therefore , although the total width of the @xmath5 is occupied by the @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the off - shell @xmath56 will permit small branching ratio to @xmath43 channel .",

    "it should be noted that the excitation threshold of the @xmath7 is very close to the @xmath0 production threshold .",

    "[ fig:(1)]c , we show that the @xmath7 is important to account for the forward peaking at @xmath63 gev . the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig:(1)]c denotes the calculations without the @xmath7 , which completely changes the angular distributions at forward angles .",
    "the difference between the solid and dashed curves , are found from the interferences between the @xmath17 and @xmath62-wave amplitudes ( dominant ones ) , which result in the forward peaking .",
    "this feature might suggest that the forward peaking can serve as a signal of the @xmath7 excitation in @xmath57 .    in the energy region , @xmath64 gev ,",
    "the angular distributions show some structures which might come from resonance excitations .",
    "we find that apart from the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , contributions from @xmath9 terms become important .",

    "explicitly , the role of the strong @xmath5 can be shown by comparing the results of the exclusive @xmath56 excitation ( dashed curve ) , and the calculations without the @xmath56 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",

    ", the second bump does not show up without @xmath9 excitation .",
    "the descrepancy between the solid and dotted curve suggests that the interferences between the low - lying resonance excitations and the @xmath9 terms play a key role in producing the second bump around @xmath12 gev . in the data from saphir",
    ", a very similar structure shows up at the same energy . but",
    "taking into account the large errors , we need more precise data to justify it .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:(2 ) ] , large partial cancellations exist between the resonance excitations and the nucleon pole terms near threshold . with the @xmath56 excitation and the nucleon pole terms , the cross sections are over - estimated significantly in the lower energy region @xmath68 gev .",
    "we do not show this result in order to keep the figure clear to read .",
    "such an enhancement , however , is cancelled by the resonance terms . removing the @xmath56 contribution , and comparing the results _ with _ ( dot - dashed curve ) and _ without _ ( heavy dotted curve ) the nucleon pole terms",
    ", we see that the nucleon pole terms cancel the amplitudes significantly over a large energy range .",
    "interestingly , such a cancellation is sensitive to the @xmath1 coupling and we find that very little freedom is left for the nucleon pole terms . when a coupling @xmath69 is adopted , the @xmath1 coupling @xmath70 can be derived .    among those low - lying resonances of @xmath66 , only the @xmath7 and @xmath13 of representation @xmath18 $ ] are above the threshold of the @xmath0 production . in general , for a resonance @xmath71 above the @xmath0 threshold , one can relate its helicity amplitudes to its exclusive total cross section at its mass position @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the branching ratio of the @xmath71 decay into @xmath43 channel .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are the two independent photon excitation helicity amplitudes of the resonance .",
    "this relation is model - independent , and thus given sufficient information for the photon interaction vertex , one would in principle be able to derive information about the meson interaction vertex for the resonance .",
    "however , at present the status of these two resonances , @xmath7 and @xmath13 , has not been well - established .",
    "information about their decay modes , branching ratios , as well as the photon excitation helicity amplitudes , is not available . to go as far as possible",
    "based on the present situation , we shall use the quark model calculations as input to study the excitations of these two resonances in the @xmath0 production . on the one hand , we calculate the exclusive total cross section @xmath77 in this model . from eq .",
    "[ a-12 ] , we can derive the quantity @xmath78 for three values of the banching ratio @xmath79 , 0.2 and 0.3 .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath80 to the branching ratio @xmath74 can be shown .",
    "on the other hand , we separately calculate the helicity amplitudes @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath80 in the nrcqm . assuming the nrcqm provides the leading order calculations for the resonance photo - excitations",
    ", we can determine the magnitudes of the @xmath43 branching ratios for these two resonances by comparing the results of the two methods .    in table  [ tab:(1 )",

    "several lessons can be learned here : i ) for both resonances , their branching ratios to @xmath43 might be as large as 20% .",
    "ii ) the @xmath7 becomes very interesting due to the feature that it favors a larger branching ratio to @xmath43 channel , and its mass is very close to the threshold of @xmath0 production .",
    "iii ) the nrcqm calculations of the helicity amplitudes give the same order of magnitude for @xmath80 , which might suggest that the meson coupling has been reasonably estimated .",
    "we do not expect the results in table  [ tab:(1 ) ] to be precise due to the present lack of data , as well as shortcomings of this approach .",
    "however , the prediction of the order of magnitude of the @xmath1 coupling can be regarded as reasonable , although so far it has not been well - determined .",
    "the @xmath0 meson production might be a possible channel to determine the @xmath7 and @xmath13 experimentally .",
    "we extend the calculation to the beam polarization asymmetry @xmath81 . in terms of the helicity amplitudes ,",

    "a bump structure is _ automatically _ produced due to the contributions of @xmath9 terms in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "a similar structure appears in the data but needs to be justified with more precise measurement .",

    "we find that near threshold such corrections do not change the calculations significantly in comparison with calculations at @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the leading order contributions based on the nrcqm contain the main characters of such a non - perturbative process .",
