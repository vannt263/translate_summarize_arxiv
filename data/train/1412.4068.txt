    "recently atlas experiment has presented results of event - by - event @xmath1  @xcite , where @xmath1 values show large variations even in the fixed centrality bin due to initial fluctuations .",
    "to control such an initial fluctuation , the event shape engineering was suggested  @xcite .",
    "this could be a useful tool to study the response of initial state to the system evolution and connect the initial and final states . in these proceedings , we present results on hbt measurements using charged pions and applying the event shape engineering technique for au+au collisions at @xmath5=200 gev recorded with the phenix experiment .",
    "the event shape engineering focuses on the fluctuations in the transverse plane , but the presence of fluctuations in longitudinal direction could cause a twisted source along that direction  @xcite .",
    "the number of participants going to the forward and backward directions is not necessarily the same , and also participant eccentricities and participant planes might be different at both angles , which leads to different event plane angles between forward and backward rapidities .",

    ", we examine the possibility of a spatially twisted source in the final state using hbt interferometry in ampt model .",

    "then we have applied this technique to the hbt measurement using charged pion pairs .",
    "charged pions were identified by the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal , @xmath14 ) and the pair selection cuts at the drift chamber and emcal were applied to remove the effects of mis - reconstructed tracks and detector inefficiency . for the hbt analysis ,",
    "pion pairs were analyzed with the out - side - long parameterization  @xcite in the longitudinally co - moving system .",

    "these oscillations of hbt radii are supposed to be sensitive to the final source eccentricity at freeze - out , @xmath20 .",
    "blast - wave studies suggest that the quantity of @xmath21 would be a good probe to @xmath20 in the limit of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes a mean pair transverse momentum .",

    "to study the twisted source in the final state , we used the data of pb+pb 2.76 tev collisions simulated using ampt model ( v2.25 with string melting ) , where the impact parameter was fixed to @xmath31 fm . for the hbt study ,",
    "the interference effect between two identical particles , @xmath32 , was calculated and weighted to the relative pair momentum distributions .",
    "then the correlation functions were reconstructed by taking a ratio of the distributions with and without the weight .",
    "also , all charged pions were allowed to make a pair with each other including @xmath33 to increase the statistics ( the consistency between results for positive and negative pairs was checked ) .",
    "the event plane was determined using particles in @xmath34 , where particles were divided into two sub - groups .",
    "a set of forward and backward event planes ( @xmath35 ) were used for the event cut which requires finite difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 as a event twist selection , whereas the other set of events was used for a reference angle of azimuthal hbt measurement .",

    "the oscillations of three hbt radii measured in positive @xmath40 regions are shifted to negative direction , which is the direction of @xmath36 in the current event cut .",
