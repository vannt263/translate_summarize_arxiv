    "<S> asce 133 ( 2006 ) 308 , we find that compaction slows down the avalanche by effectively increasing the resistive force . </S>",
    "<S> we compare currently available estimates of the resistive force , that of baant and verdure ( 2006 ) corrected for compaction for world trade center ( wtc ) 2 , and of beck , www.arxiv.org:physics/0609105 , for wtc 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on a damage wave propagating through the building before the avalanche that figures in both models : an implicit heat wave that reduces the resistive force of the building by 60% in baant and verdure ( 2006 ) , or a wave of massive destruction that reduces the resistive force by 75% in beck ( 2006 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the avalanche can not supply the energy to the heat wave as this increases the resistive force by two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we thus reaffirm the conclusion of beck ( 2006 ) that the avalanche is initiated in the wake of the damage wave .    </S>",
    "<S> baant and verdure@xcite proposed the following mathematical model to describe the progressive collapse in a tall building of a homogeneous longitudinal density @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the avalanche front , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the total mass and @xmath5 the total height of the building and @xmath6 is the gravity , while @xmath7 is a local resistive force . here </S>",
    "<S> , the dot above the quantity indicates its differentiation with respect to time . </S>",

    "<S> fig.[fig : avalanche ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we reexamine the steps that lead to eq.([eq : bazant:1 ] ) from the point of view of classical mechanics . as can be seen from fig.[fig : avalanche ] we can choose between two generalized coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the first choice is @xmath11 which for @xmath12 well describes the motion of the avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> the second choice is @xmath13 , which represents the position of the avalanche front - an idealized point - like boundary between the stationary and the moving part of the building , at which the compaction takes place . </S>",
    "<S> motion of the avalanche front is more complex than the motion of the avalanche as it combines the motion of the avalanche with its spatial growth due to non - zero compaction ratio . </S>",
    "<S> while care must be exercised when deriving an equation of motion for each of them , the final result may not depend on the choice of generalized coordinate .    for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the total energy and the total mass in the system building - avalanche is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in that case we obtain the fastest avalanche , as then there are no conversion losses of the potential energy of the building into the kinetic and then into the crushing energy of the avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> also , the conservation of energy allows us to use lagrangian formalism to derive the equation of motion .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we state the two constraints of descent ,    [ eq : constraint ] @xmath14 @xmath15    here , the top section stretches from @xmath16 down to @xmath17 , while the compacted building occupies from @xmath18 down to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath2 is the avalanche front . with eq.([eq : </S>",
    "<S> constraint:1 ] ) we state that the length of the top section @xmath20 does not change in descent , while with eq.([eq : constraint:2 ] ) we express the conservation of the mass of the building . differentiation of eq.([eq : constraint ] ) with respect to time yields dynamical constraints , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we find kinetic , potential and latent energy necessary for the lagrangian formulation . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 , where the velocity distribution in the avalanche is @xmath25 for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of the avalanche is thus @xmath27 the potential energy @xmath28 of the whole building is @xmath29 , yielding @xmath30 the latent energy @xmath31 , produces the resistive force of the building , @xmath32 .    given a lagrangian @xmath33 , which is a function of a generalized coordinate @xmath34 and its generalized velocity @xmath35 , the equation of motion follows from @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that we have two choices for the generalized coordinate : @xmath37 for the motion of avalanche , or @xmath38 for the avalanche front . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is chosen as a generalized coordinate , we simply obtain , @xmath39 with @xmath18 as a generalized coordinate we note that @xmath40 , yielding @xmath41 as expected , the two equations of motion are identical . in eqs.([eq : eom : x2 ] ) and ( [ eq : eom : x1 ] ) we introduced an additional parameter @xmath42 which may take values 1 , if the total energy is conserved , or 0 , if this is not the case . </S>",
    "<S> a distinction between the two cases is discussed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comparison between eq.([eq : eom : x1 ] ) and eq.([eq : bazant:1 ] ) of baant and verdure s shows that due to non - zero compaction the avalanche propagates through the building faster than it travels , which leads to an amplification of the building s resistive force by the factor @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the avalanche front in baant and verdure s model , eq.([eq : bazant:1 ] ) , is faster than the one proposed in eq.([eq : eom : x1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([eq : eom : x1 ] ) as a proposed correction to eq.([eq : bazant:1 ] ) is a major result of this technical note . </S>",
    "<S> we next discuss the estimates for the resistive force @xmath44 that can be found in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> baant and verdure  @xcite analyzed collapse of world trade center 2 in terms of a model  ( [ eq : bazant:1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> they assumed that @xmath44 is a constant throughout the building s primary and secondary zone , where @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> for a crushing energy they made an educated guess , @xmath46  gnm , with the floor height being @xmath47  m. considering the total mass of the building to be @xmath48  kg , this yields for the resistive force @xmath49 , as their initial estimate . </S>",
    "<S> they noted that in order for the avalanche to reach the ground level in @xmath50  s  s is an unofficial estimate of the duration of collapse of world trade center 2 . </S>",
    "<S> ] they had to use @xmath51 instead of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the 50% reduction , they argued , came from heat ( p.15 , top paragraph of the on - line edition of  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , an assumption built in their model is that the avalanche pushes a heat wave in front of itself which reduces the strength of the building by 50% . </S>",
    "<S> using their value for compaction @xmath52 and the corrected equation of motion proposed here , requires @xmath44 to be reduced by 60% instead . </S>",
    "<S> + here the following comment is in place . if the avalanche were supplying energy to the heat wave then @xmath44 in  eq.([eq : bazant:1 ] ) splits in two components . </S>",
    "<S> first , original @xmath44 decreases , say , by 60% as discussed earlier </S>",
    "<S> . however , an additional resistive force @xmath53 appears which describes the rate of transfer of energy from the avalanche to the heat wave per unit length . </S>",
    "<S> a simple estimate shows  , with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 assuming the uniform distribution of mass . taking the heat capacity of the steel @xmath56  j/(kgk ) , @xmath57  m for the height of the building , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58  k for the increase in the steel temperature at which steel strength is reduced by 50% , and @xmath59 for the ratio of the mass of steel to the total mass of the building . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath60 , which is by two orders of magnitude greater than @xmath61 , the apparent resistive force of the buildings . ] that @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus obvious that the 60%-strength - reducing heat wave could not have been created or maintained by the avalanche . on the contrary , if the avalanche were in fact heating the steel , then this acted as a resistive force comparable to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , the avalanche warming the steel by @xmath63  k yields @xmath64 which is comparable to the observed resistive force . </S>",
    "<S> we do mention , however , that the authoritative document on collapse of world trade center 1 and 2 , the nist report  @xcite explicitely states that no elevated temperatures were observed in the secondary zone .    </S>",
    "<S> rather than guessing , we proposed a procedure for estimating @xmath44  @xcite , where one first finds the ultimate yield strength @xmath65 of the vertical columns using their specifications , following which the resistive force @xmath44 is estimated from a simple linear model , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the ultimate yield strain of structural steel under compression . applying this </S>",
    "<S> to wtc 1 and 2 led to an initial estimate of @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the collapse of world trade centers 1 and 2 where we divided the building into the primary and the secondary zone where we allowed @xmath71 in the primary zone to be considerably smaller than @xmath72 in the secondary zone , @xmath73 for wtc 1 and @xmath74 for wtc 2 , while we neglected the compaction altogether . </S>",
    "<S> we did this subdivision after the statement from the nist report that the damage to the buildings was concentrated in their primary zones while leaving the secondary zones intact . </S>",
    "<S> we found that to reach the collapse time @xmath75 the initial estimate of @xmath44 had to be reduced by 75% . in our report </S>",
    "<S> we dubbed the 75%-strength - reducing wave that preceeded the avalanche the wave of massive destruction ( wmd ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the avalanche was not supplying the energy to the wmd , and the wmd propagated before the avalanche , we concluded that the wmd caused the avalanche .    </S>",
    "<S> currently , we can only speculate about the source of the 60 - 75%-strength - reducing wave and its coupling to the avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> however , a piece of information that would provide an important insight is the descent curve , which describes position as a function of time of some visible part of the building , say its top , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> once the descent curve is known it is the acceleration , @xmath76 , that can be directly connected to @xmath44 through a mathematical model . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in  @xcite we examine the descent curve available for wtc 7 in terms of a corrected model of `` crush - up '' mode of progressive collapse and identify the phases of descent .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , as the collapses of world trade centers resemble controlled demolition it would be instructive to apply the methods discussed in this and other articles to other buildings that are known to have been destroyed in controlled fashion .    2 </S>"
