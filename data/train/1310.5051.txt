    "the sample is decomposed in blocks of mass @xmath107 , labeled @xmath6 and moving along horizontal rails @xmath34 .",
    "the action of the dashpot is to resist the change in @xmath108 via viscous friction , with a resulting force on @xmath34 given by @xmath109 .",
    "the blocks move in a medium with an effective viscosity @xmath4 , we will study the overdamped regime @xmath110.as each block is described by two degrees of freedom @xmath34 and @xmath111 , its time evolution is governed by two equations .",
    "the first equation comes from the force balance on @xmath34 : @xmath112 the second equation is derived from the force balance on @xmath111 : @xmath113 where we assumed that the internal degree of freedom @xmath111 has no mass .",
    "we inject this second equation into the first , and subtract the force balance on @xmath114 to the second equation .",
    "it is convenient to let the laplacian term @xmath115 appear by defining the variable @xmath116 : @xmath117    to generalize this to higher dimensions ( on a square lattice ) , one simply has to connect each block @xmath34 to its neighbours via symmetrically arranged viscoelastic elements .",
    "the equations obtained are exactly the same , with the label @xmath6 now referring to @xmath0-dimensional space , the @xmath42 discrete laplacian replaced with the @xmath0-dimensional laplacian denoted @xmath118 , and the @xmath19 variable redefined as : @xmath119 in this way , one obtains eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the main text .",
    "it is worth to notice that the dynamics of the model without relaxation satisfies the middleton theorem @xcite that guarantees that the interface moves only forward .",
    "however , in presence of viscoelastic elements the middleton theorem does not apply , and backward movements of the interface are possible .",
    "fortunately , these movements are not frequent , due to the biased driving term @xmath120 and we observed numerically that the real dynamics yields the same statistical results as the dynamics that allows only forward movements .",
    "thus , we restrain the dynamics to forward movements .      to efficiently study eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the main text , we adopted the so - called `` narrow wells '' approximation , which does not affect the universal properties of the dynamics , and can be extended to the model with relaxation .",
    "this approach greatly simplifies the numerical simulations and allows an analytical analysis in the mean field case . in this scheme ,",
    "the disorder is modeled as a collection of narrow pinning wells representing impurities ( see fig .",
    "along the @xmath26 direction , the pinning wells are separated by random intervals ( spacings ) @xmath54 with distribution @xmath55 and mean length @xmath56 .",
    "a natural choice for @xmath55 is the exponential law , which corresponds to the case where impurities are uncorrelated in space .",
    "if the spatial extension of the wells is negligible compared to @xmath24 , we can safely assume that each block is located in one of those wells , so that its coordinate @xmath34 evolves only by discrete jumps @xmath54 . to exit from a well",
    ", a block needs to be pulled by a force larger than a threshold @xmath121 related to the well s depth . within this approximation",
    ", the continuous dynamics of the blocks can be re - written in terms of the variable @xmath58 , which measures the remaining stability range of the block @xmath6 . in the depinning model",
    "it reads : @xmath59 increasing the load @xmath13 , all @xmath58 s decrease , until a block becomes unstable ( @xmath122 ) and moves to the next pinning well ( @xmath123 ) , characterized by a new random threshold @xmath124 .",
    "the unstable block can be the seed of an avalanche because its motion produces a drop @xmath125 in the variables @xmath126 of the neighbouring blocks .",
    "the avalanche event is exhausted when all blocks are stable .",
    "in general , the mean field limit can be studied using models which are much simpler than their finite dimension counterpart .",
    "for example , the mean field depinning can be mapped @xcite onto the problem of a single particle driven in a brownian force landscape , the so - called abbm model @xcite .",
    "many results on the avalanche statistics of the mean field interface can be obtained from this latter model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a mapping does not hold in presence of relaxation ( recently , a version of the abbm model `` with retardation '' was studied @xcite , displaying aftershocks but no oscillatory behavior ) .",
    "a different strategy , which can be generalized to that case , is to consider the fully connected model , where each site interacts with all the others .    in the fully connected model , all sites are equivalent and the @xmath58 s are independent and identically distributed variables , characterized by their probability distribution @xmath65 which in general depends on the initial condition @xmath66 and on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the aim of this section is to write down the evolution equation for @xmath65 when @xmath13 increases .",
    "we will show that in the depinning case the distribution reaches a stationary form , while the viscoelastic depinning displays a periodic solution .      by replacing the local term @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) of main text with its fully connected version @xmath128 , we obtain : @xmath129 let us set the threshold force @xmath57 to be constant , a choice that , for the mean field analysis , does not alter the results .",
    "when the external driving is increased by a small positive quantity @xmath130 , the distribution evolves from its initial shape @xmath65 , to a new shape @xmath131 . in order to compute the latter , it is useful to decompose the dynamical evolution in different steps . in a first step ,",
    "the center of the parabolic potential moves from @xmath13 to @xmath132 and all @xmath58 s decrease by @xmath133 , moreover a fraction @xmath134 of sites becomes unstable and moves to the next wells .",
    "the new @xmath58 are given by @xmath135 , with @xmath54 s drawn from the distribution @xmath55 .",
    "this writes : @xmath136 the redistribution of @xmath126 s changes @xmath137 of a quantity @xmath138 , so that all blocks are subject to a shift in their @xmath58 .",
    "this can induce a second step which acts on @xmath139 exactly as @xmath140 did on @xmath65 , but with a shift @xmath141 .",
    "these steps go on until there are no more unstable sites , so that the distribution reaches the stable form @xmath142 .",
    "let us remark that eq.[[eqpdelta ] ] has a fixed point @xmath143 found when @xmath144 this equation can be easily integrated and @xmath145 determined by the normalization condition .",
    "this gives : @xmath146 where @xmath69 .",
    "a stability analysis shows that the fixed point is attractive , so that any initial condition converges to it .",
    "moreover , it is possible to prove that for a given initial condition , there exists a finite @xmath147 at which the distribution reaches the fixed point and remains there for @xmath148 .",
    "this indicates that the large time dynamics is stationary , and that the applied stress in the system is constant in time : @xmath149 this result becomes @xmath150 for an exponentially distributed @xmath54 .    for the depinning case",
    ", we can also compute the probability distribution of the avalanche sizes @xmath151 in the fully connected approximation , for finite values of the parameters @xmath152 .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath153 . for a finite system with @xmath154 sites , the typical configuration @xmath155 corresponds to a set of @xmath154 independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from @xmath46 .",
    "let us sort the set : @xmath156 .",
    "when the system becomes unstable we have by definition @xmath157 .",
    "this site jumps to the next well at distance @xmath158 , so that all @xmath58 s are decreased by @xmath159 . this will produce at least another jump if @xmath160 .",
    "more generally , the avalanche size @xmath15 corresponds to the first time that the relation : @xmath161 is fulfilled .",
    "it is thus important to study the statistics of the @xmath58 with @xmath162 .",
    "let us observe that when @xmath154 is very large the distribution of these @xmath58 s can be approximated with a uniform distribution : @xmath163 . within this approximation ,",
    "the spacings @xmath164 are independent exponential variables of mean @xmath165 and variance @xmath166 .",
    "we conclude that the sequence @xmath167 is a random walk with diffusion constant @xmath168 and drift @xmath169 .",
    "the statistics of @xmath15 thus corresponds to the problem of first crossing with @xmath170 of a random walk with diffusion constant @xmath171 and drift @xmath172 . for a positive drift",
    ", there is a finite probability that this random walk never crosses @xmath170 , which corresponds to a _",
    "global _ event . for a negative drift ,",
    "the time of zero crossing is always finite , and has been computed for the brownian motion in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the avalanche sizes thus reads : @xmath173 where for simplicity we have neglected the short - scale regularization in the expression of @xmath151 . if now we replace the choice @xmath153 with a broader function @xmath55 , the results of eq . [",
    "[ smax ] ] still hold but with a different diffusion constant .",
