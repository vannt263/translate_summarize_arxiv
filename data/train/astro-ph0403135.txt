    "@xmath9 is an example for such a puzzle .",

    "second , we realise that this power law is not directly related to the overall density profile , but is rather driven by the halo _ substructure_. this implies that the phase - space density provides a useful tool for studying the hierarchical buildup of dark - matter haloes and the evolution of substructure in them .    in we introduce @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in",

    "this is a more technical and elaborate introductory section , aimed at introducing the concepts and nomenclature relevant for the analysis of this paper .      the state of a collisionless system is completely determined by the fine - grained phase - space density function @xmath21 , which measures the mass contained in an infinitesimal phase - space patch of volume @xmath22 , located at @xmath23 .",

    "one might have thought that the conservation of @xmath1 poses severe constrains on the evolution of @xmath21 , but this is not the case due to the effects of _ mixing_. in the course of evolution , phase - space patches of high @xmath2 are stretched and spiral into regions with low @xmath2 . as the stretching continues , the patches become thiner and thiner , and as a result @xmath43 varies over increasingly smaller scales .",
    "very soon , one can no longer measure @xmath43 , but instead measure an average of it over some finite volume .",

    "to realise is that the coarse - grained @xmath46 is no longer conserved .",
    "for example , given initially a volume @xmath47 filled with phase - space density @xmath48 and a similar volume filled with density @xmath49 , one ends after mixing with a volume @xmath50 filled with an average density @xmath51 .",
    "when a large fraction of the mass is added to halo , e.g. by collapse or a major merger , rapid global fluctuations of the gravitational potential re - distribute the energies of each phase - space element , and lead to very strong mixing across large scales , resulting in variations in @xmath45 .",
    "after a few global dynamical times , the potential fluctuations fade away and @xmath45 stabilises .",

    "it is typically valid between slightly above @xmath200 and slightly below @xmath177 . outside this range ,",
    "@xmath1 gradually and systematically deviates downward from the power law . in the low-@xmath2 regime",
    "the deviation is associated with departure from the virial regime , and the high-@xmath2 deviation is consistent with being due to the limited mass resolution of the specific halo , as seen by the proximity to @xmath177 and as demonstrated in appendix  [ sec : errors ] .",
    "the high-@xmath2 deviation from the power - law tends to occur at a smaller @xmath2 value in l25 , and even smaller in l320 , due to the fact that @xmath201 is smaller respectively .",
    "there is no evidence for a significant dependence of @xmath1 on the halo mass .",
    "there may be a marginal trend for slight steepening of @xmath1 as a function of mass , but only from steeper than @xmath202 at @xmath203 to flatter than @xmath204 at @xmath205 .",

    "had @xmath0 been a function of the energy alone , and the haloes were completely spherical and isotropic , the power - law @xmath206 would have implied via eq .",

    "we conclude that @xmath2 is far from being a function of energy alone , and in particular the system must deviate significantly from spherical symmetry or isotropy",
    ". this could be mostly due to the clumpy substructure of the halo , where the surviving subhaloes contribute volume of high phase - space density to @xmath1 , thus making it shallower than expected from a smooth system with an inner density slope flatter than @xmath208 .    in order to address the hypothesis that @xmath1 is driven by substructure",
    ", we plot real - density and phase - space density maps of each halo in real - space slices . and show such maps for dwarf haloes b and c ( all other haloes show a similar qualitative behaviour ) .    the real - space density @xmath209 of each particle was calculated using a three - dimensional voronoi tessellation @xcite , generated using the free ` qhull ` software package .",
    "we chose this technique to estimate the real - space density because it is very similar in its adaptive nature to the delaunay tessellation technique used to estimate the six - dimensional phase - space density .",
    "a brief account of the voronoi tessellation technique is found in appendix  [ sec : errors ] , where it is used to estimate the errors in the dtfe method .",
    "the maps were produced in the following way .",
    "for each halo , we consider all the particles within an equatorial slice parallel to the @xmath210-plane , whose width is 40% of the virial radius .",
    "the slice is divided into @xmath211 equal cubic cells , with @xmath212 set to have the cells cubic .",
    "the density ( @xmath209 or @xmath2 ) assigned to each cell is the average of the densities of all particle within it .",
    "> from each group of cells with the same @xmath213 and @xmath214 , we plot the one with the highest density .",
    "we see that the real - space density maps are dominated by the familiar relatively smooth trend of density decreasing from the centre outward , with several tight clumps spread throughout the halo .",
    "the phase - space density maps , on the other hand , are qualitatively different . while the global trend with radius is much less apparent , the subhaloes become the highest peaks , especially in the outer regions of the halo .",
    "for example , the clumps with @xmath215 ( yellow - reddish colours ) are found everywhere .",
    "the very high peaks , with @xmath216 ( bright yellow colours ) , are all found at a considerable distances from the centre .",
    "the central peak in @xmath2 is quite modest in comparison ; the elongated structures near the centre of dwarf - halo b are most likely subhaloes in the process of merging",
    ".    highlights the same effect by showing @xmath209 and @xmath2 associated with a random subset of the n - body particles as a function of their distance @xmath16 from the halo centre .",
    "a large portion of these particles follow the global trend of decreasing density with radius  they could be associated with a smooth - background component , for which @xmath2 is approximately a function of energy alone . at radii @xmath217 ,",
    "the high-@xmath2 values come in  spikes \" corresponding to the subhaloes . while the spikes in @xmath209 reach values comparable to the central peak , the spikes in @xmath2 could be more than 100 times higher , indicating that the subhaloes are both _ compact _ and _ cold_. we note in dwarf halo b , for example , that all the points where @xmath218 are in subhaloes .",
    "the other interesting feature of the spikes is the fact that they seem to get lower and broader as they get closer to the halo centre , and that beyond a certain radius ( of about @xmath219 ) , the spikes completely blend into the smooth background .",
    "this indicates that the subhaloes phase - mix and lose their high phase - space densities as they approach the halo centre .",
    "this seems to be the natural result of mergers and _ tidal effects _ , which both puff up the subhaloes and heat them up .",
    "as a first attempt at trying to understand how the power law @xmath220 in a halo of mass @xmath221 may originate from its substructure , we simply add up the typical contributions from the general population of haloes of different masses @xmath112 smaller than @xmath221 , as predicted in the @xmath4cdm cosmology . based on cosmological n - body simulations @xcite , and in accordance with the press - schechter approximation @xcite and its extensions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass function of small - mass haloes ( not necessarily subhaloes ) can be approximated by @xmath222 , with @xmath223 .",
    "additionally , we assume that the average density profiles of haloes of different masses have the same functional form and are simply scaled versions of each other .",
    "this is established by @xmath224-body simulations for the case of _ isolated _ haloes , but is less clear when one considers subhaloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we adopt this assumption as our first crude toy model .    as a first approximation",
    "we assume that the haloes all form at the same time in an einstein - desitter cosmology , so they have the same characteristic real - space density @xmath225 ( a constant factor times the universal density ) , and therefore their typical radii scale like @xmath226 .",
    "based on the virial theorem , the velocity dispersions then scale like @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , the typical phase - space volume of a halo of mass @xmath112 scales like @xmath228 , and its typical phase - space density is @xmath229 . if we denote by @xmath230 the universal , un - scaled , normalised , dimensionless probability distribution function relevant for all the haloes , then the volume distribution function @xmath231 of a halo of mass @xmath112 , defined such that @xmath232 is a volume , is given by @xmath233 then the total contribution to @xmath1 of halo @xmath221 from the population of smaller haloes @xmath234 is @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the mass of the largest subhalo ( @xmath237 ) .",
    "changing variables @xmath238 , we finally get @xmath239 thus , @xmath1 is a multiple of a power - law @xmath240 and a monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 ; it therefore has to be shallower than the power law @xmath240 . for @xmath241 ,",
    "this means that @xmath1 is shallower than @xmath242 , which is significantly shallower than the measured @xmath243 .",
    "this idealised toy model does not seem to work .",
    "this calculation can be generalised to the case where haloes of smaller masses form first , as implied from the slope of the initial fluctuation power spectrum @xmath244 . for an einstein - desitter cosmology ,",
    "the formation time scales with @xmath112 such that @xmath245 , with @xmath246 , and @xmath224 is the local power index , @xmath247 , at the relevant effective scale for masses @xmath248 .",
    "then , in analogy to the calculation in the previous paragraph , we have @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and we finally obtain that @xmath1 must be flatter than the power law @xmath252 for @xmath253 , namely @xmath254 , the asymptotic index for small haloes where all haloes form at the same epoch , we recover the earlier result that @xmath1 is flatter than @xmath240 . for @xmath4cdm on galactic scales , the effective power index is @xmath255 , so @xmath256 , and for @xmath257 we obtain that @xmath1 is flatter than @xmath258 .",
    "we see that the time dependence makes only a little difference .",
    "the total @xmath1 of the halo should be the sum of the background contribution and the subhalo contribution , but at the high-@xmath2 range we expect @xmath1 to be dominated by the contribution of subhaloes , as seen earlier in this section .",
    "the above toy model thus predicts that @xmath1 should be flatter than @xmath242 , in conflict with the measured @xmath259 .",
    "we conclude that a halo is not simply an ensemble of clumps drawn from the general population of smaller haloes .",
    "the subhaloes may have a different mass function , their shape properties may vary differently with mass , and they both could vary with distance @xmath16 from the host - halo centre . if one keeps the scaling relation with @xmath254 and ignores any variation with @xmath16 , the required subhalo mass function for matching the measured @xmath259 is with @xmath260 ( compared to @xmath261 ) . indeed , a flattening of the subhalo mass function could be a natural result of the inevitable dynamical evolution of the subhaloes in the potential well of their host halo .",
    "the phase mixing due to tidal effects , including total disruption , is likely to be more efficient in less massive subhaloes , thus flattening the mass function .",
    "also , dynamical friction is more efficient in making more massive subhaloes sink into the halo , thus making the mass function flatter in the inner parts .",
    "however , recent simulations indicate that the subhalo mass function is not flatter than @xmath262 @xcite , indicating that the tidal effects on the inner structure of subhaloes must also have an important role .",
    "these are matters for more detailed future studies , but the failure of the idealised toy model analysed above to reproduce the magic power law @xmath259 indicates that the phase - space density is likely to provide a useful tool for studying the dynamical evolution of subhaloes in host haloes .",
    "using delaunay tessellation , we developed a method for measuring the 6-dimensional coarse - grained phase - space density @xmath0 in @xmath8-body systems .",
    "we focused , in particular , on measuring the phase - space volume distribution function , @xmath1 .",
    "we applied this technique to several simulated haloes of @xmath126 particles , formed by hierarchical clustering in the standard @xmath4cdm scenario , and obtained two striking new results .",
    "first , @xmath1 is well described by a power law , @xmath263 , over 3 to 5 decades in @xmath2 .",
    "the power - law regime starts at an @xmath2 value which corresponds to the characteristic size of the virialized halo .",
    "it ends at an @xmath2 value which is determined by the dynamical resolution limit of the specific simulation .",
    "therefore , the true power - law range may extend to @xmath264 .",
    "this power law seems to be insensitive to the halo mass in the range @xmath5 , indicating insensitivity to the exact slope of the fluctuation power spectrum , as long as the haloes are built by hierarchical merging of clumps bottom up .",
    "second , this power - law originates from substructures within the halo rather then the overall trend with radius .",
    "the substructure completely dominates the high-@xmath2 parts of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the infalling clumps seem to phase - mix  by puffing up , heating and stripping  as their orbits decay from the virial radius inwards toward the halo centre and they melt into the halo smooth background .",
    "our first worry is that these results could be numerical artifacts , or severely contaminated by such .",
    "based on our error analysis and tests with mock datasets , we argue that the @xmath1 measured by the dtfe algorithm genuinely reflects the true phase - space properties of the given @xmath8-body system over a broad range of @xmath2 .",
    "the question is whether the phase mixing suffered by the subclumps as they approach the halo centre might be an artifact of numerical effects such as two - body relaxation , leading to underestimated inner densities and/or overestimated internal velocities .",
    "a similar effect has been pointed out using a one - dimensional toy model @xcite .",
    "the apparent agreement between simulations run with different codes and different resolutions is encouraging . in order to specifically address the effect of few - body relaxation , we intend to run twice a simulation of the same halo with the same number of particles but with a different force resolution ( ongoing work with f. stoehr ) .    assuming that the simulations genuinely reflect the true physical behaviour under the vlasov equation , the origin of the robust power - law shape of @xmath1 from the merging substructure becomes a very interesting theoretical issue .",
    "as demonstrated in , a simple model using the mass function and the scaled profiles of the general halo population in the @xmath4cdm scenario does not reproduce the correct power law .",
    "this , and the apparent trend of the @xmath2 spikes with radius , indicate that the structural and kinematic evolution of the subhaloes in the parent halo are important",
    ". studies of tidal heating and stripping may be found useful in this modelling .",
    "it would be interesting to follow the phase - space evolution and the contribution to the overall @xmath1 by a single , highly resolved subhalo , or many of those , as they orbit within the parent halo and approach its centre . this may help us understand the nature of the interaction between the parent halo and its subhaloes , and the origin of the @xmath1 power law ( ongoing works with e. hayashi and with b. moore ) .",
    "another more general but speculative possibility is that the @xmath265 power law represents some sort of a cascade of relaxation processed in phase - space , in which high phase - space densities turn into lower ( coarse - grained ) densities through the process of mixing . in general",
    ", the fact that our findings are expressed in terms of the fundamental concept of phase - space density should make them more directly accessible to analytical treatment . in this respect , it may prove beneficial to investigate more closely the time evolution of the @xmath1 of a cosmological halo and its components .",
    "this may shed light on the connection between the @xmath1 power - law behaviour and the relaxation processes within the halo .",
    "we saw that the power - law behavior of @xmath1 is limited to the virial regime .",
    "it would be interesting to learn how this shape evolves in time as the halo virializes .",
    "a preliminary study ( to be concluded and reported in another paper ) indicates that in the intermediate-@xmath2 regime the @xmath1 of a pre - virialized system is significantly flatter than @xmath265 , while in the high-@xmath2 regime it drops in a much steeper way .",
    "the @xmath265 behaviour seems to be a feature unique to virialized systems .",
    "we learnt that in the haloes that are built by hierarchical clustering , the power - law behaviour @xmath266 reflects the halo substructure",
    ". it would be interesting to find out whether this power - law behaviour actually requires substructure , or it is a more general phenomenon of virialized gravitating systems , valid independently of substructure .",
    "one way to answer this question would be to analyse simulated haloes in which all fluctuations of wavelengths smaller than the halo scale were removed , resulting in a smooth halo formed by monolithic collapse , with no apparent substructure in the final configuration . as described in , such haloes are known to still have nfw - like density profiles in real space , and one wonders whether they also have the magic power - law @xmath1 .",
    "there are preliminary indications for a steeper @xmath1 in this case ( arad , dekel & moore , in preparation ) .",
    "if confirmed , it would indicate that the @xmath265 behaviour , while insensitive to the exact slope of the initial power spectrum , is unique to the hierarchical clustering process , and is not a general result of violent relaxation .",
    "our current results are just first hints from what seems to be a promising rich new tool for analysing the dynamics and structure of virialized gravitating systems",

    "however , the similar voronoi method provides a simple way of learning about the properties of the measured @xmath1 and understanding the uncertainties associated with such a measurement .",
    "the empirical tests of the delaunay measurements below demonstrate the relevance of the wisdom gained by analysing the voronoi model .    to understand the errors in the voronoi density estimation , let us start with the trivial case where all of infinite phase - space is uniformly filled with phase - space density @xmath271 , which is represented by an infinite number of particles with mass @xmath112 .",
    "a volume @xmath47 of phase - space would then contain on average a finite number of particles , @xmath272 .",
    "the voronoi estimate of @xmath131 for each particle would fluctuate about @xmath271 due to the discreteness of the particle distribution . since there is no typical scale in the problem , and",
    "each cell always contains one particle , the fluctuations @xmath273 per voronoi cell would remain at the same level even if one increases the average number density of particles while decreasing the mass of each particle in proportion , keeping @xmath271 the same .",
    "therefore , the probability that the voronoi estimated @xmath2 would lie in the interval @xmath274 may be written in terms of a universal probability distribution function @xmath275 .",
    "when we consider a finite system in a box of volume @xmath47 , with a finite number of particles @xmath8 inside it , we may expect the probability distribution @xmath276 to deviate from its asymptotic form @xmath277 .",
    "as @xmath8 decreases , we expect @xmath276 to widen due to the increasing effect of the boundaries .",
    "next , examine a system with a non - uniform phase - space density , such as a cosmological halo . if the number of particles that represent this @xmath2 is sufficiently large , we may approximate every region in phase - space as being locally uniform , and estimate its voronoi @xmath2 using the asymptotic @xmath277 . this assumption is expected to break down in regions with very high phase - space density , where the sampling may become poor and insufficient , or in regions where @xmath2 has large gradients over small scales .",
    "nevertheless , lets assume for the moment that there exists an effective @xmath161 [ not necessarily @xmath277 ] which properly approximates the fluctuation distribution of the voronoi @xmath2 for all particles .",
    "this assumption allows us to calculate the expectation value of @xmath270 for a finite system with a given @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by first calculating the average of @xmath279 , the cumulative version of @xmath270 defined in  ( [ def : vf ] ) , and then differentiate it to obtain the average of @xmath270 . assuming that @xmath0 is realised by @xmath280 particles , we divide phase space into a large number of cells @xmath281 , which are small enough to guarantee that ( a ) each cell is very unlikely to contain more than one of the @xmath8 particles , and ( b ) the value of @xmath0 is approximately constant within every cell .",

    "therefore , even with an infinite resolution the voronoi tessellation would not produce the exact @xmath1 ; it converges to a convolution of it with a fixed window @xmath277 .",

    "both systems were realised using @xmath145 particles . in both cases",
    "we have also plotted the cumulative distribution @xmath156 for a homogeneous poisson distribution , realised in a six - dimensional cubic box with @xmath145 particles .",
    "we have verified that this distribution is essentially unchanged when the calculation is done with @xmath179 particles .",
    "therefore , it should be regarded as good approximation to the asymptotic limit we would have reached in the different bins , had we used an infinite number of particles .",
    "the other four systems give essentially the same results .    in the 1-v system ,",
    "five bins were defined by @xmath306 .",
    "we see that the shape of the distribution , corresponding to the width of the differential distribution , is very much independent of @xmath157 . for all bins ,",
    "the full width is less than a 1.5 decades . on the other hand ,",
    "there does seem to be a systematic shift of the median toward larger values of @xmath156 for smaller values of @xmath157 .",
    "the large shift of the highest-@xmath2 bin ( @xmath307 ) toward small @xmath156 is a result of the very low number of particles in that bin , less than 500 , which is insufficient for representing such high phase - space densities .",
    "the bias toward larger phase - space densities in the low-@xmath308 bins may be attributed to boundary effects : while the total mass of the @xmath8 particles in the realisation is equal to the total mass one would obtain from the exact @xmath0 integrated over the infinite phase - space , the total phase - space volume used by the dtfe to estimate @xmath0 is finite .",
    "it is the smallest possible convex polygon containing all @xmath8 particles .",
    "therefore , we may expect an overestimate of @xmath2 , which would be more pronounced near the boundaries .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see by comparing @xmath160 to @xmath163 , on scales of a few - decades , this bias is rather meaningless .",
    "the @xmath156 distributions of the 1-c system are essentially the same as the ones in the 1-v system . here",
    "4 bins were defined by @xmath309 .",
    "the overall shape of the plots changes very little from bin to bin , and its width is about a decade and a half .",
    "additionally there exists the bias towards larger @xmath156 ratios as @xmath157 gets smaller .    to see how",
    "well the dtfe reconstructs the true @xmath1 , we have measured the @xmath160 of the six mock systems using @xmath310 , @xmath179 and @xmath145 particles for each system .",
    "figures  [ fig : dtfe - vs - exact - c ] ,  [ fig : dtfe - vs - exact - v ] present the results of these numerical experiments .",
    "we see that with the highest resolution , of @xmath145 particles , the recovery is excellent over a range of almost 7 decades in @xmath2 .",
    "systematic deviations begin at the high-@xmath2 end and the low-@xmath2 end . at both ends ,",
    "the deviations appear at about one to two decades inward to the highest and lowest values of @xmath153 in that realisation .",
    "when the resolution is decreased , the @xmath2-range where @xmath160 closely matches @xmath163 narrows gradually .",
    "as argued above , the systematic deviations at the low-@xmath2 end are probably a result of the finite phase - space volume occupied by the particles .",
    "as the number of particles is increased , a larger portion of phase - space is covered , enabling the reconstruction of lower values of @xmath153 .",
    "the high-@xmath2 systematic deviations can be qualitatively understood using the voronoi model and its convolution formula ( [ eq : av - vf ] ) .",
    "since the dtfe uses a finite number of particles to recover the @xmath2 field , there must be an upper cutoff , @xmath311 , for the spectrum of @xmath2 values that the dtfe can produce in principle .",
    "as far as the dtfe is concerned , the true @xmath1 has an effective cutoff at @xmath311 . if we plug this  true \" truncated @xmath1 into the convolution formula ( [ eq : av - vf ] ) ,",
    "assume a distribution function @xmath161 with a width of about 1 decade , and set @xmath312 , we recover the qualitative behaviour of the measured @xmath160 for the @xmath313 mock samples with @xmath304 and the three values of @xmath297 .",
    "this simple picture is , however , an oversimplification because the high-@xmath2 region is also effected by statistical fluctuations due to the low number of particles there .",
    "the convolution formula can also explain the _ overestimation _ by the @xmath160 in the high-@xmath2 regions of the mock systems with @xmath305 .",
    "in these systems , the transition between the low-@xmath2 power - law and the steep high-@xmath2 decline is rather sharp ; it occurs over a scale comparable to the width of the window function @xmath161 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath160 measurement at a high-@xmath2 includes contributions from the higher @xmath1 values at lower @xmath2 .",
    "this becomes very apparent in the case with @xmath111 and @xmath305 , in which @xmath2 has an upper bound of @xmath314 .",
    "while the true @xmath1 vanishes for all @xmath2 values larger than this limit , the dtfe - measured @xmath1 vanishes only at an @xmath2 value that is an order - of - magnitude larger , due to the 1-decade width of the assumed probability distribution function @xmath161 .",
    "the voronoi model can also be used to estimate the _ statistical _ errors in @xmath270 . strictly speaking",
