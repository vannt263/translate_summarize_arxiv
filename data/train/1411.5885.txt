    "arrays of josephson devices have been studied intensively during the last several decades @xcite .",
    "the recent interest to these objects has been stimulated by the applications in quantum computing @xcite or design of metamaterials , based on the arrays of rf - biased squids ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of relativistic time dilation has been suggested in the array of asymmetric squids @xcite .",
    "this system is described by the double discrete sine - gordon ( ddbsg ) equation @xcite and it will be the subject of the current article .",
    "on the other hand , the problem of topological soliton ( kink or antikink ) mobility in discrete media has attracted much attention within recent years .",
    "it has been demonstrated that solitary waves in nonlinear lattices can propagate with constant shape and velocity without any radiation @xcite despite the presence of the non - zero peierls - nabarro potential .",
    "these solutions are spatially localized ( have finite energy ) and exist for a discrete set of velocities , in contrast to the continuous models where the allowed velocities usually occupy a continuous interval , bound from the above by some critical velocity value . since their existence is associated with avoiding the resonances with the linear spectrum of the underlying system , they are called _",
    "solitons @xcite .",
    "these solitons exist in different systems , including the continuum versions of the sine - gordon @xcite and double sine - gordon @xcite equations with the high - order dispersion . in this article",
    "it will be shown that the ddbsg equation , that models the asymmetric squid array , also possesses discrete embedded solitons . taking into account that the model of the squid array is based on the rcjm ( resistively and capacitively shunted junction model ) , the consideration of dissipation and external dc bias is essential , and this also will be done in the current article .",
    "thus , the aim of this work is twofold : ( i ) to study the dynamical fluxon properties in the squid array , and , in particular , to obtain the current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) of the array ; ( ii ) to demonstrate the signatures of the fluxon as an embedded soliton that moves along the array without significant radiation .",

    "the former case physically means that the @xmath24 , thus the left arm of the squid effectively disappears .",
    "the latter case means that @xmath25 and the same happens to the right arm . in both the cases the elementary cell of the array",

    "further on , all velocities that satisfy @xmath61 will be called _ sliding _ velocities since the kink slides along the lattice with these velocities without any radiation .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) with the sliding velocity @xmath71 into the actual ddbsg equation ( [ 1 ] ) results in the kink propagation continuously with this velocity @xmath71 without any noticeable radiation .",

    "it appears that if the initial soliton velocity differs from @xmath71 insignificantly the soliton can travel for a long time around the lattice [ see fig . [ fig3](b ) ] .",

    "is restored .",

    "the numerically - computed cvcs are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] by the markers while the blue solid lines correspond to the analytical formula ( [ 11 ] ) that stems from the continuum approximation .",
    "this approximation predicts the continuous curve @xmath94 and appears to work well only for the small values of @xmath12 .",
    "surprisingly , it gives the correct slope of the cvc near the origin even for the strongly discrete array ( @xmath67 ) , however it works rather poorly for the larger values of the external bias .",
    "the numerically computed average voltage drop is defined as @xmath95 if the fluxon propagates with the constant velocity @xmath57 it produces the average voltage drop @xmath96 .",
    "the cvc calculation procedure can be described as follows .",
    "we start at the zero bias ( @xmath97 ) and integrate the equations of motion ( [ 1 ] ) with the 4th order runge - kutta method for each value of @xmath12 during the time @xmath98 .",
    "when the average voltage ( [ 12 ] ) reaches the desirable tolerance , @xmath12 is increased by some small amount and the procedure is repeated again .",
    "the same calculation has been performed when @xmath12 is decreased till @xmath97 .",
    "since the cvcs demonstrate complex hysteretic structure ( sometimes multiple ) , each branch has been path - followed back and forth between its respective ends .",
    "the typical cvcs consists of the cascades of separate branches that appear due to the fluxon coupling with the plasmon modes , see theoretical @xcite and experimental papers @xcite . while moving along the array , the fluxon excites the plasmon modes and forms a bound state that propagates with the same velocity . if @xmath57 is the fluxon velocity , the plasmon phase velocity should equal @xmath57 as well .",
    "thus , the plasmon wavenumber is given by the root of the following equation : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the plasmon dispersion law ( [ wl ] ) .",
    "due to periodicity of the boundary conditions the phase locking in the array would occur if the finite number of the josephson phase oscillations will fit into one cycle of the fluxon journey along the array .",
    "in other terms this means that a certain number of the plasmon wavelength should be fitted in the array , as one can easily see from the inset in fig.[fig4](a ) , where the @xmath101 distribution is given from the two neighbouring voltage steps .",
    "thus , the different number of oscillations fitted in the array corresponds to the different branch of the cvc .",
    "this situation has been reported in the literature @xcite together with the approximate values of the voltage steps , so we will not dwell on it any longer .",
    "analysis of these cvcs shows that there exist both qualitative and quantitative differences between the cases when the ddbsg equation has at least one sliding velocity in the hamiltonian limit and when there is no such a velocity .",
    "these differences can be summarized in the following two paragraphs .",

    "however , the peaks at @xmath146 , @xmath147 can be spotted much better comparing to another chaotic case , shown in the panel ( b ) .",
    "we have also checked the dynamics of the isolated branch in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) at @xmath108 .",
    "both the lle calculations and the spectral analysis show that the dynamics there is also chaotic and the power spectrum is similar to the spectrum in fig . [ fig7b](b ) .",
    "the careful investigation of the cvcs demonstrates the non - monotonic dependence of the critical depinning current @xmath159 on the asymmetry parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the critical depinning current is the minimal bias current which can sustain the pinned fluxon state ( @xmath160 on the cvc ) . indeed , as on",
    "can see from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the critical depinning current equals @xmath161 for @xmath106 and @xmath162 for @xmath37 . at first glance",
    "this seems to be surprising , as we can naively suppose that the pinning of the fluxon is defined by the barrier height of the double sine - gordon potential @xmath31 ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this suggestion is obviously wrong , since the height of @xmath31 decreases with the growth of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the critical current @xmath159 on the asymmetry parameter @xmath19 appears to be non - monotonic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in order",
    "explain this behaviour it is useful to compute the pn potential and its barrier as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the concept of the pn potential is known for a long time @xcite and is used to describe the motion a topological soliton in the discrete media as a motion of an inertial particle in the field produced by the spatially periodic potential .",
    "this is , in fact , the pn potential , @xmath163 and @xmath164 is the soliton center of mass .",
    "the pn barrier is defined as @xmath165-\\min_x [ v_{pn}(x)]$ ] . if @xmath166 the pn potential can be computed analytically@xcite and for the dsg equation it satisfies @xmath167 . in our case",
    "the perturbational approach will fail , therefore the pn potential has to be computed numerically .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the pn barrier as a function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath19 is demonstrated by the solid black line .",
    "the dependence is non - monotonic and has a clear minimum for the same @xmath19 where the @xmath168 has a minimum . at this minimum",
    "the barrier is decreased by the order of magnitude .    , left scale ) and the pn barrier ( solid black line , right scale ) as a function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath19 for @xmath69 .",
    "the red line is used as a guide for an eye .",
    "the inset shows the distribution of the @xmath33 for the pinned fluxon at @xmath169 , @xmath170 ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath171 , @xmath172 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the solid lines are used as guides for an eye . ]",
    "this non - monotonic behaviour of the pn barrier as a function of the shape parameter ( and also of the coupling constant @xmath72 ) is already known for other discrete klein - gordon systems @xcite with the on - site potentials that depend on the shape parameter .",
    "the reason is the following . under the certain set of parameters @xmath173 both",
    "the site - centered and bond - centered static kink states are the local minima of the total energy , while the local maximum corresponds to the asymmetric configuration , which is intermediate between the site - centered and bond - centered states . for these parameters",
    "the function @xmath173 attains its minimum .",
    "it is important to note that if @xmath20 , i.e. , in the case of the conventional dsg equation , the bond - centered state is always a local minimum and the site - centered state is always a saddle point .",
    "thus , for the dsg equation @xmath173 is simply the difference of the energies of these kink configurations .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the pinned fluxon profiles for @xmath169 and @xmath171 , while the @xmath168 dependence attains its minimum at @xmath174 . in the former case",
    "the bond - centered fluxon is the local minimum of the energy while in the latter case it is the site - centered fluxon .",
    "the fluxon profiles look a bit asymmetric because the non - zero bias makes the total potential energy asymmetric with respect to the point @xmath51 .",
    "in this article it has been demonstrated how the features of the kink mobility in the discrete klein - gordon models can be manifested in realistic systems . as a particular system",
    "the array of the asymmetric three - junction squids has been considered .",
    "this object is described by the discrete double sine - gordon equation ( ddbsg ) .",
    "the main result can be summarized as follows . in the hamiltonian limit",
    "the ddbsg equation alongside with other similar models , like the peyrard - remoissenet @xcite and the double morse @xcite chains , allows for a discrete set of kink velocities ( _ sliding _ velocities ) with which monotonic ( @xmath175 ) kinks can propagate .",
    "these excitations belong to the family of the so - called _ embedded _",
    "solitons @xcite . the signature of the sliding velocities",
    "can be spotted on the cvcs of the array .",
    "this signature is a significant inaccessible voltage interval ( ivi ) , i.e. the voltage that can not be produced by the moving fluxon . as the voltage drop is proportional to the fluxon velocity",
    ", one can speak also about the inaccessible velocity interval .",
    "this interval does not appear if the asymmetry parameter @xmath176 is too small and there is no sliding soliton velocities in the hamiltonian limit .",
    "the ivi becomes more pronounced if @xmath19 increases or if @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , the lower edge of the ivi tends to zero , while the upper edge converges to the value @xmath177 with @xmath57 being the sliding velocity .",
    "another important result is the significant lowering of the critical pinning current due to the change of @xmath19 .",
    "the explanation is based on the non - trivial dependence of the pn barrier on the asymmetry parameter .",
    "similar results on the lowering of the activation barrier for solitons have been reported earlier for other lattice models @xcite .",
    "it is also important to comment on the connection with the problem of the radiationless motion of the bunched kink ( fluxon ) states in the ordinary dsg lattice .",
    "the symmetric squid array , or , equivalently the array of parallel shunted small josephson junctions @xcite is described by the dsg equation .",
    "it has been shown in several cases both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that the radiationless sliding of the coupled pair of several kinks ( @xmath34 , @xmath178 , etc . )",
    "is possible for the selected set of kink velocities .",
    "this phenomenon has been treated analytically in the quasi - continuum approximation in refs .",
    "@xcite , but it takes place even in the sufficiently discrete array ( @xmath179 ) as well .",
    "in the limit @xmath22 the double sine - gordon potential in ( [ 4 ] ) becomes the ordinary sine - gordon potential with the period @xmath42 , thus , the above - mentioned result of the bound state of two @xmath42 kinks is the special case of the kink mobility of the ddbsg equation in the limit @xmath180 .    in the current model",
    "the role of the mutual inductances of the array cells has been neglected in accordance the previous work @xcite .",
    "if the mutual inductances are taken into account , the dynamics of the josephson phases should be described not by the ddbsg equation ( [ 1 ] ) but by eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "the main difference between these two equations lies in the nature of the coupling term . while in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) there is coupling only between the nearest neighbouring josephson phases , the case with mutual inductances accounts for coupling of all josephson phases of the array .",
    "the existence of the sliding velocities depends primarily on the properties of the current - phase relation that contains the @xmath23 and the @xmath21 terms , and not on the interaction .",
    "therefore , we do not expect any qualitative differences if the mutual inductances are taken into account .",
    "the quantitative differences may occur because the value of the sliding velocity depends of the coupling parameter .",
    "finally , we remark that the ddbsg equation ( [ 1 ] ) can describe another system - the parallel array of josephson junctions that have the biharmonic current - phase relation @xmath181 @xcite [ here the substitution @xmath182 should be performed in order to get eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ] .",
    "this , in particular , is true for the superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) and superconductor - ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor ( sfis ) junctions .",
    "naturally , the phenomena , discussed in this paper apply to the arrays of the sfs and sfis junctions as well .",
