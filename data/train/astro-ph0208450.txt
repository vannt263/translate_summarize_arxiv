    "the chemical abundances of the highest h i column density quasar absorbers ( @xmath19 atoms @xmath3 ) , the damped lyman-@xmath1 systems ( dlas ) , are commonly expressed using column density weighted measurements .",
    "they are used as observational tracers of the cosmological evolution of metallicities , up to very high redshifts ( see for example pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ; lu et al . 1996",
    "; prochaska & wolfe 1999 , 2000 , 2001 ; dessauges - zavadsky  2001 ; ledoux , bergeron & petitjean 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "however , recent studies give somehow surprising results : prochaska & wolfe ( 2002 ) claim no evolution of the mean weighted iron metallicity over the redshift range @xmath20 , in contradiction with predictions from essentially all chemical evolution models .",
    "a possible explanation for this result is that iron is not the optimal element for tracing metals on cosmological scales , because it is easily depleted onto dust grains .",
    "dust depletion greatly complicates the interpretation of the metal content of dlas . nevertheless at very high - redshift ( @xmath21 ) , there are evidences that [ fe / h ] is beginning to fall , in such a way that at @xmath22 the metallicity is substantially lower than at @xmath23 ( prochaska , gawiser & wolfe 2001 , songaila & cowie 2002 )",
    ".    pettini  ( 1994 ) estimated the dust content of dlas with the help of a comprehensive survey of zn measurements , an element which is known to be only slightly depleted onto dust grains , and thus provide an unbiased tracer of metallicities .",
    "however such measurements are challenging because of both the paucity and weakness of zn features in quasar absorbers . at the moment , only two measurements of [ zn / h ] have been made in dlas at z@xmath243 ( molaro  2000 , levshakov 2001 ) . here , we present a third detection of zn in a dla at z@xmath253.35 , thus providing clues on the dust - free abundance determination in high - redshift damped lyman-@xmath1 systems .",
    "we first detail the observational set - ups and data reduction processes of the quasar spectrum .",
    "we then present the analysis and chemical abundance determination for a number of elements in the dla studied , providing a short discussion on the consequences of these additional measurements at high - redshift .",
    "is a high - redshift ( @xmath26 @xmath25 3.96 ) quasar exhibiting broad absorption lines ( bal ) discovered by storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "the data presented in this study were obtained using the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the 8.2 m vlt in april 2000 and april 2002 .",
    "uves is particularly well suited for the study of zn at high - redshift thanks to its good sensitivity at the longer wavelengths .",
    "three partially overlapping setups ( 480 + 710 + 725 ) were used to provide a complete coverage of the quasar spectrum ranging from @xmath25 4195   to 9200  .",
    "the individual spectra were reduced using the uves data reduction pipeline of the eso midas package ( see ballester  2000 for a detailed description ) .",
    "the steps of the data processing include wavelength calibration , order extraction and flat - fielding .",
    "once extracted , the individual frames were corrected to a vacuum heliocentric scale and combined together resulting in a spectrum with signal - to - noise ratio of about 40 per pixel at @xmath25 7000 .",
    "the quasar continuum was then fitted to the quasar spectrum using a spline function .",
    "a careful inspection of the spectrum bluewards of the lyman-@xmath1 emission reveals a dla absorption in a region free of bal features . the redshift ( @xmath0 ) is well defined by the presence of higher lyman series lines and heavy element absorption lines including some from zn  ii .",
    "the h  i column density of this system is measured by fitting a theoretical voigt profile to the lyman series .",
    "the quasar continuum was fitted with a spline function in midas .",
    "as always in dlas at high - redshift , the positioning of the continuum over the strong absorption lines is the main source of uncertainties in the h  i column density measurement .",
    "the use of several lines to perform the fit gives confidence in the result however .",
    "the fitting of the profile is performed with vpfit  rfc / vpfit.html ] ( webb  1987 ) and the resulting fit is presented in figure 1 for the first three lines of the lyman series .",
    "the total h  i column density is @xmath27(h  i ) @xmath28 atoms @xmath3 .",
    "we derive the column density of the ions associated with the dla by fitting theoretical voigt profiles to the observed features minimizing @xmath29 . for this purpose",
    "we make use of the fitlyman package in the midas data reduction software .",
    "only the lines free of telluric contamination and blending are used to determine the column densities of the elements . in particular",
    ", we took great care to check possible atmospheric contamination in the cr  ii @xmath30 2062 region ( see figure  [ fig : sky ] ) .",

    "although statistics are small , our result suggests an increase of metallicities from @xmath35 to present times .",
    "previous compilations of zn measurements at all redshifts have shown that the column density weighted metallicity does not evolve with time ( pettini  1997 , vladilo  2000 , prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) .",
    "these authors argue however that this can not be directly interpreted as a lack of evolution of the cosmic metallicity of dlas since measurements are still affected by low number statistics and possible bias against high column density , high metallicity absorbers ( as first pointed out by fall & pei 1993 and boiss 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of this bias is controversial at the moment ( ellison  2001 , prochaska & wolfe 2002 , petitjean  2002 ) and many more measurements of undepleted metals in quasar absorbers are needed at @xmath35 before any conclusion can be drawn .",
