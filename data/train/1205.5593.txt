    "the study of @xmath2 supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of nonlinear evolution equations has been largely studied in the past @xcite in terms of integrability conditions and solutions .",
    "such extensions are given as a grassmann - valued partial differential equation with one dependent variable @xmath3 which is assumed to be bosonic to get non trivial extensions .",
    "the independent variables are given as a set of even ( commuting ) space @xmath4 and time @xmath5 variables and a set of odd ( anticommuting ) variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "since the odd variables satisfy @xmath8 , the dependent variable @xmath9 admits the following finite taylor expansion @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are bosonic complex valued functions and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are fermionic complex valued functions . in this paper , we show that some of these extensions can be related to a linear partial differential equation ( pde ) by assuming that @xmath9 is a chiral superfield @xcite . proving the integrability of an equation by linearization has been largely studied in the classical case @xcite and has found new developments in the @xmath15 formalism @xcite .",
    "we propose a similar development in the @xmath2 formalism . in @xmath2 susy",
    ", we consider a pair of supercovariant derivatives defined as @xmath16 which satisfy the anticommutation relations @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we consider also the complex supercovariant derivatives @xmath19 which satisfy @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in terms of the complex grassmann variables",
    "@xmath22 , the derivatives ( [ complexder ] ) admits the following representation @xmath23 and the superfield @xmath9 given in ( [ fielda ] ) writes @xmath24 the fermionic complex valued functions @xmath25 are defined as @xmath26 .",
    "chiral superfields are superfields of type ( [ chisuper ] ) satisfying @xmath27 . in terms of components ,",
    "we get @xmath28 or equivalently @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in the subsequent sections , we produce solutions of @xmath2 susy extensions of the korteweg - de vries@xcite ( skdv@xmath31 ) , modified korteweg - de vries@xcite ( smkdv ) and burgers@xcite ( sb ) equations from a chiral superfield point of view .",
    "in this instance , the equations , in terms of the complex covariant derivatives ( [ complexder ] ) , reads , respectively , as @xmath32a+i(a-1)[d_+a , d_-a]+aa^3)_x,\\label{skdv}\\\\ a_t&=-a_{xxx}-2a_x^3 - 6([d_+,d_-]a)^2a_x,\\label{smkdv}\\\\ a_t&=(i[d_+,d_-]a+2a^2)_x,\\label{sb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33=xy - yx$ ] is the commutator . in ( [ skdv ] )",

    "we thus treat skdv@xmath36 and smkdv together and construct classical @xmath37 super soliton solutions @xcite and an infinite set of similarity solutions @xcite . in section iv , we demonstrate the existence of special @xmath37 super soliton solutions , called virtual solitons @xcite , for the susy extensions of the kdv equation with @xmath38 and the burgers equation using a related linear partial differential equation .",
    "the last section is devoted to a @xmath39 extension of the kdv equation @xcite in an attempt to construct a general @xmath37 super virtual soliton solution .",

    "the absence of the grassmannian variables @xmath42 and @xmath43 derivatives in equations ( [ n2kdv ] ) , ( [ n2mkdv ] ) and ( [ n2b ] ) , indicates that the odd sectors of chiral solutions should be free from fermionic constraint .",
    "this property is in accordance with the integrability of these extensions due to arbitrary bosonization of the fermionic components@xcite of the bosonic superfield @xmath9 .    from the classical case ,",
    "we know that the methods of resolution of all these equations are similar . the same could be said for the susy case . indeed ,",
    "if we assume the introduction of a potential @xmath44 such that @xmath45 in ( [ n2kdv ] ) and after one integration with respect to @xmath4 , we get @xmath46 where the constant of integration is set to zero .",
    "the same is done on equation ( [ n2b ] ) and leads to @xmath47 we thus observe that the equations ( [ n2mkdv ] ) , ( [ skdv1 ] ) and ( [ sn2b ] ) are now on an equal footing , i.e. the order of the equation in @xmath4 is equal to the number of appearance of @xmath48 in the nonlinear terms .",

    "the choice @xmath49 in ( [ skdv1 ] ) gives , up to a slight change of variable , the smkdv equation ( [ n2mkdv ] ) .",

    "recently , the formalism was adapted to @xmath2 extensions@xcite by splitting the equation into two @xmath15 equations , one fermionic and one bosonic .",
