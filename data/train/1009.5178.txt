    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are potential sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the required local uhecr emissivity is @xmath0 at proton energy @xmath1 ev @xcite , the local grb rate may be in the range of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath3 for the power - law index of accelerated protons , the necessary total isotropic - equivalent energy in protons would be @xmath4 erg when integrated over @xmath5 ev . compared to the isotropic - equivalent energy released as gamma - rays , typically @xmath6 erg",
    ", this indicates that the accelerated protons must dominate the energy budget of grbs in order for them to be viable sources of uhecrs .",
    "although @xmath7 in grbs may appear physically demanding , a number of considerations provide some justification @xcite .",
    "first , in the popular internal shock model where the prompt mev gamma - rays are attributed to synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated in shocks within the grb outflow @xcite , the efficiency with which the electrons are energized may be limited in comparison with the total available energy , which is the dissipated fraction of the bulk kinetic energy conveyed predominantly by protons . since simple coulomb collisions are ineffective in transferring the energy of the protons to the electrons within a dynamical timescale , it has been generally assumed that this can occur through some plasma instabilities with efficiencies @xmath8-@xmath9 .",
    "however , this is by no means physically guaranteed , so we are motivated to consider the possibility of proton - dominated grbs with @xmath10 and explore its consequences .",
    "note that a high proton - to - electron ratio is not only observed in galactic cosmic rays and inferred in supernova remnants @xcite , but also theoretically expected , at least for nonrelativistic shocks @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission spectra of grbs are known to be generally well described by the so - called band model , consisting of a hard , low - energy power - law part , a softer , high - energy power - law part , and a spectral peak in between in the sub - mev range @xcite .",
    "however , the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( _ fermi _ ) recently detected an additional , hard spectral component above @xmath11 gev in the prompt phase of the short grb 090510 @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding alternative models @xcite , if the grb accelerated ultra - high - energy protons with isotropic - equivalent luminosity @xmath12 erg@xmath13s , synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) emission from an electron - positron pair cascade triggered by photopion interactions of the protons with low - energy photons @xcite can account for this gev emission @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in this same burst , the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) observed a further , soft excess feature below @xmath14 kev , which appears to lie on a continuation of the hard , gev power - law .",
    "a similar , even clearer x - ray excess , as well as a gev excess was also reported for the prompt emission of the long grb 090902b @xcite .",
    "evidence of extra low - energy components was also reported in about @xmath15 % of batse bursts @xcite . in the optical band ,",
    "several grbs have exhibited prompt optical fluxes that are brighter than expected from simple extrapolations of their low - energy band spectra @xcite .",
    "one of the most impressive cases was the extremely luminous optical emission of the `` naked - eye '' grb 080319b @xcite .    despite alternative explanations such as an early onset of the afterglow @xcite or upscattering of external / photospheric photons @xcite , the emission from hadronic pair cascades can also potentially account for the excess components in the x - ray or even optical band , owing to the generally very wide distribution in energy of the secondary pairs and their resultant radiation .",
    "in addition to high - energy gamma - rays , prompt x - ray and optical emission may thus prove to be valuable observational signatures of uhecr acceleration in grbs .",
    "here we demonstrate this through monte carlo spectral modeling , focusing on the two remarkable cases of grb 090902b and grb 080319b .",
    "our monte carlo code self - consistently calculates the photon and neutrino spectra corresponding to individual pulses in the grb prompt emission in a one - zone approximation , including all relevant leptonic and hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the code can be found in a series of previous publications @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we choose not to explicitly model the mev - range band spectral component , whose true origin is currently under debate and may or may not be related to electrons accelerated in internal shocks . even in the case",
    "that photospheric emission or some other mechanism is more relevant , it is plausible that coexisting internal shocks @xcite or magnetic reconnection regions @xcite accelerate protons to ultra - high energies within the grb outflow .",
    "here we simply assume that a radiation field consistent with the observed band spectrum is present within the emission region , which also contains magnetic fields with energy density @xmath16 , and is moving out with bulk lorentz factor @xmath17 at radius @xmath18 from the central engine .",
    "protons are injected in this environment with isotropic - equivalent luminosity @xmath19 in the form of a power - law energy distribution with a high - energy cutoff , @xmath20 , above @xmath21 gev in the comoving frame .",
    "the maximum proton energy @xmath22 is determined by the balance between the acceleration timescale @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the proton gyroradius , and either the comoving expansion timescale @xmath25 or the proton cooling timescale @xmath26 due to synchrotron and photomeson production losses .",
    "we choose @xmath27 as required for uhecr production by grbs , and observationally inferred for supernova remnant shocks @xcite . of the free model parameters @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the latter two can be quantified relative to the photon energy density @xmath28 of the band component with isotropic - equivalent luminosity @xmath29 as @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the physical processes taken into account are 1 ) photon emission and energy losses by synchrotron radiation and compton scattering including the klein - nishina regime for electrons / positrons , protons , pions and muons , 2 ) synchrotron self - absorption for electrons / positrons , 3 ) @xmath33 pair production , 4 ) photomeson production for protons and neutrons , 5 ) bethe - heitler pair production ( @xmath34 ) , and 6 ) decays of pions and muons .    for the results below , we do not include the effects of intergalactic @xmath35 absorption due to the extragalactic background light , since the latest observational constraints ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) indicate that it should not be severe at the energies and redshifts of our interest here .",
    "grb 090902b at @xmath36 was one of the most energetic long grbs with isotropic energy @xmath37 erg @xcite .",
    "the detection by _ fermi _ of an 11 gev photon together with variability on timescales @xmath38 ms during the prompt phase implies a minimum bulk lorentz factor @xmath39 . between @xmath40 s and @xmath41 s where @xmath42 is the _ fermi _ gbm trigger time , a hard power - law component with photon index @xmath43 was found above 0.1 gev , in addition to a component well fit by a band function with low - energy photon index @xmath44 , high - energy photon index @xmath45 and peak energy @xmath46 kev .",
    "this band component manifests an atypically narrow energy distribution , as apparent in figure [ fig:0909 ]",
    ". also observed was a soft excess feature below 50 kev that is consistent with an extrapolation of the gev power - law down to these energies .",
    "the gray shaded area in figure [ fig:0909 ] represents the 1-@xmath47 confidence region of the best - fit , unfolded spectrum for grb 090902b , based on a likelihood analysis of the combined gbm and lat data under the assumption of a band function plus an additional power - law @xcite .",
    "overlayed in figure [ fig:0909 ] is our model of pair cascade emission induced by ultra - high - energy protons for the parameters @xmath48 cm , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the overall agreement is good , except for some deviation above @xmath52 gev .",
    "considering the low photon statistics at the highest energies for the lat , and the fact that the reference spectrum is an unfolded one wherein a simple functional form was assumed , we do not consider this to be a serious discrepancy .",
    "because the gev component is characterized by photon index @xmath53 with relatively low power compared to the band component , it can be reproduced reasonably well by pair cascade emission that is dominated by synchrotron processes in a relatively strong magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the necessary nonthermal proton luminosity is then not excessive and only comparable to the band component luminosity .",
    "these inferences are in notable contrast to the case of grb 090510 , whose gev emission was harder with photon index @xmath54 and more luminous , warranting a stronger inverse compton contribution from the secondary pairs and consequently a weaker magnetic field .",
    "this entailed a lower @xmath22 and hence lower photopion production efficiency , leading to the requirement that @xmath55 erg @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the cascade emission also extends to low energies and naturally explains the x - ray excess . note that a proton synchrotron model would have difficulty accounting for such spectra with roughly equal power across a very broad energy range . on the other hand , for the present parameters",
    ", we do not expect strong emission down to the optical band , as the spectrum turns over at @xmath57 ev due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "moreover , the narrow energy distribution of the band component and the corresponding @xmath35 opacity precludes the injection of electrons / positrons with energies low enough to radiate in the optical ( see thin blue curve in figure [ fig:0909 ] where self - absorption is neglected ) .",
    "we also mention that the high - energy cutoff due to @xmath35 absorption expected at @xmath58 gev is a diagnostic feature to be tested in future observations of similar bursts .",
    "grb 080319 at @xmath59 was also an energetic long grb with isotropic gamma - ray energy @xmath60 erg .",
    "most remarkably , it was accompanied by an extremely bright , prompt optical burst reaching 5.3 apparent magnitude , earning the moniker `` naked - eye grb '' . unlike most previous prompt optical detections that could be reasonably interpreted as emission from an external reverse or forward shock @xcite , the unprecedentedly well - sampled light curve of this burst revealed several peaks over the first @xmath61 s that were correlated with the variability in mev gamma - rays @xcite , before switching over to a behavior more typical of afterglows .",
    "furthermore , the early optical fluxes lie far above low - energy extrapolations of the concurrent , time - resolved band spectra , clearly pointing to a distinct spectral component associated with the prompt phase @xcite . among different possibilities ,",
    "an interpretation attributing the optical and mev emission respectively to the synchrotron and synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) processes have often been invoked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for comparison with our hadronic cascade model",
    ", we focus on the time interval between @xmath62 s and @xmath63s where @xmath42 is the swift / bat trigger time , during which the band component reaches a maximum luminosity of @xmath64 @xmath56 .",
    "the band parameters we adopt are @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 kev , noting that @xmath68 is only constrained by the data to be @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ fig:0803 ] illustrates our results for the parameters @xmath70 cm , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "synchrotron emission from the pair cascade softens the spectrum below @xmath74 kev so that the low - energy slope of the band component becomes concordant with the observed value of @xmath75 .",
    "the cascade emission continues down into the optical band with some curvature and accounts well for the observed optical intensity as long as synchrotron self - absorption does not set in , which necessitates @xmath76 and @xmath77 cm .",
    "such large values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 imply a relatively low comoving photon density and thus low photopion production efficiency , which scales as @xmath78 .",
    "this in turn calls for a proton luminosity @xmath79 , strongly dominating that in the band component .",
    "note that a substantially larger energy budget than in mev gamma - rays alone is also unavoidable in the ssc model for grb 080319b due to luminous , second - order ic emission in the gev band @xcite .",
    "occurring before the launch of _ fermi _ , the gev properties of grb 080319b remains largely unknown .",
    "upper limits at the level of @xmath80 above @xmath81 gev were obtained by milagro @xcite .",
    "this does not contradict the high - energy component expected in our model , consisting of synchrotron emission from secondary pairs with luminosity @xmath82 and photon index @xmath53 , extending up to a cutoff @xmath74 gev due to internal @xmath33-absorption ( figure [ fig:0803 ] ) .",
    "the spectral shape is conspicuously different from the sharply peaked one expected from second - order ic emission in the ssc interpretation @xcite , providing an important distinguishing feature for uhecr - induced emission components .",
    "the overall similarity of our model spectrum for grb 080913b with that of grb 090902b also encourages us to search for optical signatures in future _ fermi _ grbs .",
    "emission from pair cascades initiated by photopion production of ultra - high - energy protons in grb outflows can yield spectra with roughly equal power over a broad energy range . while gev - tev signatures due to hadronic processes have been discussed previously by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the relevance of associated x - ray or optical features had not received much attention .",
    "here we showed that synchrotron emission from hadronic cascades can reproduce the excess x - ray and gev components in grb 090902b , as well as the bright optical emission in grb 080319b .",
    "unlike the case of grb 090510 , the necessary proton luminosity for grb 090902b is only comparable to the observed photon luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , grb 080319b calls for an isotropic - equivalent proton luminosity @xmath83 @xmath56 , which may appear extreme but is in fact consistent with the energetics requirements for grbs to be the origin of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the detailed time variability properties of the low - energy excess components are not yet known observationally , except for the well - documented optical light curve of grb 080319b @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although an in - depth discussion is beyond the scope of this paper , we may expect the variability of hadronic cascade emission to be influenced by the timescale of photopion production and thus qualitatively different from purely leptonic processes .",
    "there should also be a close connection between the excess components at low and high energies .",
    "the x - ray excess may be better characterized in the near future by the joint astrophysics nascent universe satellite ( janus ) , which will conduct prompt grb observations including the 1 - 20 kev band .",
    "the continuing development of wide - field and/or rapidly - slewing telescopes @xcite should bring forth a clearer picture in the optical band for more bursts .",
    "the broadband variability of hadronic emission components will be discussed at greater length in subsequent work .    in order to explain the complex behavior of the afterglow of grb 080319b , a two - component jet model was discussed in @xcite , with a narrower and faster jet dominating the early phase of the afterglow , and a wider and slower jet describing the later phase .",
    "such composite models would loosen the constraints that we obtained here for our one - zone model .",
    "if the wider jet is the main site of proton acceleration , and if it is dense enough to cause @xmath84 collisions in the prompt phase , there may be other parameter sets that can reproduce the optical emission .",
    "furthermore , the jet collimation - corrected energy in protons can be diminished in such a composite model .",
    "one of the problems for the internal shock synchrotron model of the prompt emission is the difficulty in accounting for the observed low - energy spectra of the band component , which are generally much harder than naive expectations with @xmath85 , including the grbs dealt with in this paper .",
    "many authors have proposed modifications to the model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or alternatives such as those based on photospheric emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although here we have tacitly assumed the presence of the band component as is observed , in the future we intend to model all spectral components self - consistently within the context of physical processes that can reconcile the low - energy index observations , in order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of emission mechanisms together with uhecr production in grbs .",
