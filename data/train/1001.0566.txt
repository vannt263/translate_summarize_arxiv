    "in the standard @xmath9 cold dark matter ( @xmath9cdm ) picture , galaxies are assembled via the progressive ( hierarchical ) merger of increasingly more massive subunits ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "about 1/2 of the stellar mass in present - day massive ( @xmath10 ) galaxies is expected to be accreted via major mergers at @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mergers should therefore be a common occurrence in the life of galaxies and have a profound influence on their properties ( such as star formation , morphology and nuclear activity among others ) .",
    "observational and theoretical evidence suggests that an increasing fraction of mergers at lower redshifts should take place between spheroidal or gas - poor galaxies ( ` dry ' mergers ) . in their study of the morphology of merging pairs in a cdm universe",
    ", @xcite found that elliptical galaxies brighter than @xmath12 were mainly formed via major dry mergers and that gas - rich mergers were only important at lower luminosities . above a ` threshold ' mass of @xmath13 m@xmath14 , galaxies are not expected to grow their stellar mass by ( induced ) star formation , but their primary mode of mass accretion at @xmath11 is via gas - poor ( stellar - dominated ) mergers @xcite . unlike gas - rich mergers , dry mergers are not expected to disturb the observed tight scaling relations for early - type galaxies @xcite and to better reproduce the internal structure of local ellipticals @xcite .    the first examples of dry mergers , in significant numbers , were observed as close pairs of galaxies on the red sequence in deep images of high redshift clusters @xcite , where approximately 50% of galaxies were expected to have undergone a dry merger to the present epoch . in the local universe , @xcite estimated that @xmath15 of @xmath16 bright ellipticals in the musyc and ndfws surveys showed residual structural features indicative of a dry merger in the ` recent ' past .",
    "@xcite used close pairs in the combo-17 survey having similar photometric redshifts _ and _ showing evidence of interactions to infer an integrated merger rate of @xmath17 since @xmath18 for red galaxies with @xmath19 , while @xcite used dynamically close pairs in the deep2 survey to derive an integrated dry merger rate of @xmath20 at @xmath21 for galaxies with @xmath22 .",
    "however , @xcite identify close pairs in the rcs survey and derive an integrated merger rate of only @xmath23 per gyr since @xmath24 for galaxies with @xmath25 , and @xcite use the same approach as @xcite on lrgs in the sdss survey to determine a merger rate of @xmath26 per gyr at @xmath27 for galaxies with @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite find evidence of few to zero pairs of red galaxies at @xmath29 in the goods data .",
    "the small scale correlation function of lrgs in the sdss at @xmath30 analyzed by @xcite is consistent with an upper limit of @xmath31 per gyr to the dry merger rate for galaxies with @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite used this method to derive a merger rate of @xmath34 per gyr for @xmath19 galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite obtain an integrated merger rate of @xmath15 for lrgs at @xmath36 in the ndfws survey .",
    "finally , @xcite apply the correlation function method to galaxies the 2slaq survey to derive a merger rate of @xmath37 per gyr at @xmath38 .",
    "the galaxy merger rate has been usually measured via the fraction of galaxies in close pairs , often with the added requirement of closeness in velocity space to cull interlopers ( e.g. , @xcite  hereafter , p00,p02 ) , and the fraction of galaxies showing significant asymmetries in their light distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rationale behind the former approach is that if a merger is to occur , a companion must be present , and therefore the close pair fraction is related to the _ future _ merger rate for the galaxies being considered .",
    "the latter method relies on the observation that if a galaxy has undergone a recent merger , it is likely to be morphologically disturbed , and therefore an asymmetric light distribution would be a signpost of a recent merger .",
    "a critical discussion of these approaches may be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we derive the dynamically close pair fraction for galaxies in the 2slaq survey and determine an upper limit to their merger rate .",
    "the benefit of using close pairs is that we are able to select major merger candidates between galaxies in a specified mass range ( by appropriately choosing the luminosity of and magnitude difference between participating galaxies ) , derive a merger rate within a specified timescale ( dependent on the chosen projected and velocity separations for the pair members and theoretical simulations ) and identify ongoing merger candidates for later study .",
    "galaxy asymmetries tend to be more difficult to interpret in this fashion and usually require better quality imaging than we have available in our survey , especially for dry mergers @xcite , to which the 2slaq survey is most sensitive .",
    "unlike asymmetries , galaxy pairs are sensitive to the merger fraction of ` progenitor ' halos and this quantity may be more directly compared to theoretical models @xcite .    the structure of this paper is as follows : in the next section we present the data , describe the methodology and derive the pair fraction and an upper limit to the dry merger rate at the intermediate redshifts sampled by the 2slaq survey .",
    "we then discuss and compare our results in the context of galaxy formation models and recent work on the dry merger rate .",
    "we adopt the latest cosmological parameters with @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 km / s / mpc . unless otherwise stated , all absolute magnitudes quoted in the following",
    "are intended as including a term of @xmath42 and all distance measures need to be referred to @xmath43 ( to the appropriate power ) .",
    "the data used in the 2slaq survey consist of lrgs with @xmath44 mag . from the original sample of @xcite , selected by their @xmath45 and @xmath46 colors to lie at @xmath3 ( see @xcite for a description of the sdss filter system ) .",
    "photometry and astrometry for the target lrgs are derived from the sdss data release 1 @xcite with improvements from the latest release available at the time of the spectroscopic observations ( dr4  @xcite ) .",
    "the objects lie in two long strips on the celestial equator , divided into several disconnected patches , each of which is between 10 and 30 deg@xmath47 in area , for a total survey coverage of 182 deg@xmath47 .",
    "spectroscopy for candidate lrgs was carried out at the anglo - australian telescope using the 2df facility @xcite . for objects in the main sample ( sample 8)",
    ", it was found that most galaxies are within the specified redshift limits and were observed with high spectroscopic completeness ( typically @xmath48 ) .",
    "a complete description of the data can be found in the general survey paper by cannon et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter c06 ) . because we have highly complete spectroscopy , we can confirm that at least 90% of our galaxies have k - type or lrg spectra , with no sign of star formation , while less than 1% of the sample shows emission lines @xcite .",
    "we can therefore use this sample to measure the dry merger rate .",
    "following @xcite , we computed the absolute magnitude for objects with reliable redshifts , @xmath49 corrected to the sdss @xmath50 band at @xmath51 .",
    "this facilitates comparison with previous work on galaxy evolution and the merger rate from the sdss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that no correction for internal extinction was applied to these galaxies .",
    "we calculate close pair statistics following the formalism developed by patton et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ; hereafter p00 , p02 ) for the ssrs2 and cnoc2 surveys . here",
    ", we give an ` algorithmic ' description of the procedures used , and show how we apply weights to correct for sources of incompleteness and the flux limited nature of the 2slaq survey . a fuller description of the method can be found in p00 , p02 .",
    "let us consider a sample of @xmath52 primary galaxies brighter than a limiting absolute magnitude @xmath53 in some volume of space , and , in the same volume , a sample of @xmath54 secondary galaxies brighter than a limiting absolute magnitude @xmath55 .",
    "the two samples may coincide ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) , as is often the case for redshift surveys : we then study ` major ' mergers between galaxies of approximately similar luminosity .",
    "we are interested in knowing the fraction of galaxies in the secondary sample that are dynamically close to galaxies in the primary sample .",
    "we define two galaxies to be dynamically close if they have a projected separation @xmath57 kpc and a velocity difference of @xmath58 km s@xmath1 , as used by p00 , p02 and in subsequent work .    of course",
    ", pair statistics are usually computed from redshift surveys , which are flux - limited rather than volume limited .",
    "we therefore need to account for the dependence of pair counts on the clustering properties and the mean density of galaxies in the sample , and to correct for sources of spatial and spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "because clustering is luminosity dependent ( e.g. , @xcite ) we follow p00 and restrict the analysis to a fixed range in luminosity , within which clustering properties are not expected to vary significantly , by imposing additional bright ( @xmath59 ) and faint ( @xmath60 ) limits on the sample .",
    "this means that we derive a pair fraction ( and merger rate ) for galaxies within a specified range and ratio in luminosity .    in our case , we select galaxies with @xmath3 ( where the survey is most complete ) and with @xmath61 and @xmath62 mag . because the range of luminosities we survey is small , we let @xmath60 coincide with @xmath55 .",
    "we also let the primary and secondary samples coincide , to select major mergers between galaxies of approximately equal luminosities ( and make full use of the spectroscopic sample ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of 2slaq galaxies in absolute magnitude vs. redshift , together with selection lines in magnitude and redshift ( see below for details ) .",
    "the faint limit allows us to include most 2slaq galaxies at @xmath63 and reaches slightly below the luminosity of normal @xmath12 galaxies at the mean survey redshift ( or , similarly , below the turnover in the 2slaq lrg luminosity function of @xcite ) .",
    "we choose the bright limit of @xmath64 to avoid the rarer and most luminous galaxies in 2slaq , which are likely to be more biased , and to mitigate the effects of luminosity - dependent clustering ( as described above ) . with these choices ,",
    "we study major mergers , with luminosity ratio @xmath65 , where the secondary is at least 4 times less luminous than the primary galaxy , for @xmath66 .",
    "we can translate our luminosity range into a stellar mass range using the conversion between @xmath50 band absolute magnitude and stellar mass by @xcite , for typical lrg colors ( @xmath67 ) and with assumptions as to stellar populations as in @xcite . with these choices",
    "our @xmath68 luminosity range corresponds to a stellar mass range of @xmath69@xmath70 m@xmath14 .",
    "the pair fraction that we actually measure needs to be corrected to the value that would be observed in an ideal volume - limited survey . in a flux - limited sample",
    ", primary galaxies at lower redshifts will have a greater likelihood of having a secondary companion within the survey than galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "we correct for this bias by assigning a greater weight to the rarer companions found at the high redshift end of the survey .",
    "this is carried out by computing for each galaxy a weight that renormalizes the sample to the density corresponding to a volume limited sample within @xmath72 .",
    "the weight is calculated by integrating the luminosity function over the appropriate ranges in absolute magnitude .    at each redshift , we then search for pairs of galaxies within @xmath59 and a redshift - dependent absolute magnitude limit @xmath73 , which is defined as :    @xmath74\\ ] ]    where @xmath75 mag .",
    "is the apparent magnitude limit of the survey , @xmath76 is the luminosity distance and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the @xmath79 and evolutionary corrections . recall that here @xmath60 is set to coincide with @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath49 corrections are taken to be the maximal corrections for a galaxy formed at high redshift and undergoing pure passive evolution , as other choices would allow galaxies to fall in and out of the sample according to their star formation histories ( p00 , p02 ) .",
    "note that here @xmath80 means ` the brightest of ' rather than the ( arithmetically ) larger quantity .",
    "1 shows this selection limit as applied to 2slaq data .",
    "each secondary galaxy is weighted by the inverse of a selection function @xmath71 defined as the ratio of densities in volume - limited vs. flux - limited samples :    @xmath81    @xmath82    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the lrg luminosity function from @xcite .",
    "the integrals run from @xmath59 to either the faint absolute limit @xmath55 ( in the denominator ) or to the redshift dependent absolute magnitude limit @xmath73 ( in the numerator ) set by the apparent magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "galaxies in the primary sample at low redshift will also have the largest number of observed companions , while primaries at higher redshifts will have fewer observed companions .",
    "this effect is corrected in a similar fashion as for galaxies in the secondary sample , by applying the inverse of the secondaries weight to primaries , i.e",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 .      we need to account for pairs missed because one of the galaxies falls outside of the survey footprint .",
    "a potential companion may lie beyond the survey limits on the sky or be hidden in the ` shadow ' of a bright star , where galaxies can not be detected or the spectra are contaminated . for each primary galaxy",
    "we compute the fraction @xmath88 of the @xmath89 area that may lie outside of the effective survey area .",
    "the weight to be applied to the secondary galaxies is then @xmath90 .",
    "primary galaxies may similarly be lost in the survey boundaries and the appropriate weight to be applied to the primary sample is @xmath91 .    for objects with small separations ,",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline tends to merge pairs into a single galaxy . for the lrg sample studied by @xcite",
    "the pipeline becomes unreliable for @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath93 @xmath0 kpc search radius we use corresponds to angular separations of @xmath94 to @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
    "we inspected all our 7889 images to verify whether the sdss pipeline correctly identifies photometric companions , using the sdss image list / navigate tools .",
    "the results are that the pipeline certainly finds all targets with projected separations between @xmath97 and @xmath98 . for smaller separations",
    "the pipeline is more erratic , especially for fainter systems .",
    "we therefore exclude an area of @xmath97 around each target from our search for companions and correct for the missed region via the @xmath99 weight , where we assume that the distribution of pairs is uniform with projected separation over these small scales .",
    "the size of the added factor lies between 37% and 54% depending on redshift .",
    "the sdss pipeline also tends to ` double count ' light for close pairs , making these galaxies brighter than they would otherwise be . because fainter galaxies have more mergers and minor mergers are more common @xcite , this has the effect of artificially raising the pair fraction .",
    "@xcite estimate that this should decrease the actual merger rate for galaxies with @xmath100 by a factor of about 5 .",
    "since this is an uncertain correction and we are interested in an upper limit to the merger rate , we do not consider this effect here ( the effect can not be well modelled for our sample , as the sdss pipeline can not be run locally ) .",
    "we also correct for possible companions missed by the redshift ` cuts ' we apply to the survey .",
    "if the primary lies within 500 km s@xmath1 of the redshift boundaries , we ignore all companions between the primary and the borders and apply a weight @xmath101 to all other companions in the opposite ` direction ' .",
    "we also need to apply a similar weight to account for potential primaries lost in the redshift boundary .",
    "this weight is the reciprocal of the weight applied to the secondaries , i.e. , @xmath102      as all redshift surveys , 2slaq is not complete to its flux limit .",
    "our success rate is @xmath48 for all galaxies within sample 8 of c06 but the spectroscopic incompleteness may be dependent on the separation between galaxies .",
    "fibers in the 2df positioner can not be placed closer than about @xmath104 from each other in every single configuration .",
    "however , this effect is compensated by the overlap between individual 2slaq tiles and by the fact that fiber configurations were generally retouched halfway through each ( typically 4 hours ) exposure to place fibers assigned to galaxies for which a reliable redshift had already been obtained on to a nearby target ( see c06 for a description of the observations ) .    in order to correct for this source of bias",
    "we need to estimate the relative incompleteness for close pairs over the range of separations of interest ( corresponding to 20 @xmath0 kpc ) and compare it with the incompleteness at large separations , where fiber interactions are not important .",
    "we follow p02 and estimate this weight by computing the ratio between the number of pairs between galaxies with redshift information ( @xmath105 ) _ within the redshift range of interest _ and the number of pairs in the input photometric sample ( @xmath106 ) , which is by definition complete , as a function of angular separation @xmath107 the weight to be applied is the ratio between the spectroscopic and photometric pair completeness at each separation normalized to the value at large separations .    in 2slaq",
    "we have higher overall completeness than cnoc2 ( by about a factor of 2 ) but sample a smaller range of projected separations ( because of our higher mean redshift ) .",
    "we plot @xmath108 vs. @xmath107 in fig .  2 for sample 8 targets ;",
    "the error bars are assumed to be poissonian .",
    "although the data are noisy ( because there are relatively few potential pairs to start with ) , the value of @xmath109 at @xmath110 is consistent with the value of this ratio at @xmath111 , arguing that we are not systematically more incomplete at small separations than at large ones where we are not affected by fiber collisions .    p02 model the incompleteness in the cnoc2 survey by fitting a polynomial to the ratio @xmath112 as a function of projected separation @xmath107 .",
    "given the small number statistics and noisier nature of our data , it is not fully justified to model the completeness as a function of @xmath107 with a polynomial as done in p02 .",
    "we therefore adopt an uniform weight of 1 for 2slaq galaxies over the separation of interest , as we do not appear to be systematically more incomplete than at larger separations .",
    "although pair completeness drops at @xmath113@xmath114 separations , because of fiber collisions , these large separations are not relevant to our study ( as pairs with @xmath115 @xmath0 kpc or @xmath116 km @xmath117 are largely spurious ",
    "p00 , de propris et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "given the small number statistics , and the fact we are ultimately deriving an upper limit , we eventually decided to follow the approach by @xcite to estimate the contribution from close pairs missed because of fiber collisions .",
    "we search around each of our main targets ( sample 8 galaxies with @xmath118 and @xmath3 ) for a companion ( lying within @xmath119 ) in the sample of galaxies ( from the input photometric sample ) for which we did not obtain a valid redshift .",
    "if such a companion exists , we assign to it the same redshift as the primary galaxy and require that the companion lies within the selection lines in fig .  1 .",
    "this identifies all pairs ( a total of 3 ) which are potentially missed because of redshift incompleteness .",
    "pairs where both members are missed by the spectroscopic survey , will share in the general 2slaq incompleteness , without a bias for incompleteness at small angular separations .",
    "we can assume that all these 3 ` extra ' pairs are real and treat them as a source of systematic error on our determination of the pair fraction and the merger rate .",
    "figure 3 shows postage stamp images of the two dynamical pairs we find and of the three possible pairs .",
    "p02 also use a weight @xmath120 which accounts for the local magnitude incompleteness around each galaxy , a geometric effect due to slit placement and limiting filters in the cnoc2 survey , a color term and a term that depends on the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function over the redshifts covered by the survey .",
    "this weight is specific to the methods employed by the cnoc2 survey @xcite . in our case",
    ", we have a very homogeneous sample , there is no geometric effect ( other than the one corrected by @xmath103 ) , all galaxies have similar colors and the color selection is very efficient in selecting galaxies of the appropriate magnitude and redshift . even in the cnoc2 survey",
    "most of these weights are equal to 1 @xcite for most galaxies . for these reasons",
    ", we do not adopt this weight in our study .",
    "following p00 the number of close companions per galaxy in a flux - limited sample can be expressed as :    @xmath121    and the total companion luminosity :    @xmath122    the sums run over the @xmath123 primary galaxies : @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the number and summed luminosity of galaxies from the secondary sample that are dynamically close ( as defined above ) to the @xmath126 primary galaxy and are expressed as :    @xmath127    @xmath128    where the sums run over those @xmath129 galaxies in the secondary sample that fulfill the criteria for being dynamically close to the @xmath126 galaxy in the primary sample .    the weights to be applied to the secondary sample correct for spatial incompleteness ( @xmath130,@xmath131 ) and the flux - limit of the survey ( @xmath132 ) for each @xmath133 companion .",
    "we do not apply the spectroscopic incompleteness weight @xmath103 because we use the alternate method described above to calculate the contribution from missed close pairs .",
    "the weights are defined in the previous subsections .",
    "similar weights also need to be applied to the primary sample , to correct for spatial incompleteness and the mean density :    @xmath134    @xmath135    where @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( i.e. , the reciprocals of the weights applied to the secondary sample ) .",
    "no spectroscopic completeness weight is needed for the primary sample .      in order to convert a pair fraction into a merger rate",
    "the timescale for the merger event needs to be estimated .",
    "merger timescales are difficult to determine and depend on the poorly known details of the merger process and how the potential of the individual galaxies reacts to the merger episode .",
    "the more commonly used timescales in previous work and semi - analytic models are based on dynamical friction arguments .",
    "the dynamical friction timescale can be calculated as @xcite :    @xmath138    where r is initial physical pair separation in kpc , @xmath139 is the circular velocity in km s@xmath1 , @xmath140 is the mass and @xmath9 is the coulomb logarithm . assuming @xmath141 kpc , @xmath142 km s@xmath1 and @xmath143 for equal mass mergers , we get a typical dynamical friction timescale between 0.1 and 0.3 gyrs over the range of masses we sample .    the calibration by @xcite for the merger timescale of pairs in n - body simulations with @xmath144 m@xmath14 and a velocity separation of 300 km s@xmath1 yields 0.9 gyr , while the estimated merger timescale from the n - body simulations of @xcite is @xmath145 gyr for the mass ratios we consider . a comparison between merger timescale by dynamical friction and in n - body simulations by @xcite shows that the dynamical friction formula underestimates the merger timescale by a factor between 1.7 and 3.3 for mergers of mass ratio 1:3 to 1:10 respectively , and leads to a 40% overestimate of the mass accretion rate ( mainly via minor mergers ) .",
    "we can now apply the above procedure to the 2slaq sample . out of 7889 galaxies",
    "we find a total of one dynamically close pair ( we find a second pair , but it lies within the @xmath97 exclusion circle ) .",
    "this yields a pair fraction @xmath146 and a luminosity accretion rate @xmath147 @xmath148 . for galaxies within @xmath149",
    "this is @xmath150 .",
    "normally , errors on these quantities can be estimated by bootstrap resampling or jack - knifing , but this is not feasible with a sample of only two objects .",
    "we then proceed to estimate an upper limit to the pair fraction and the merger rate .        where @xmath153 is the pair fraction",
    ", @xmath154 is the number of pairs , @xmath155 is the number of objects in the sample , @xmath156 is the upper @xmath157 probability limit to the pair fraction and @xmath158 is the lower @xmath157 probability limit to the pair fraction .",
    "the region between @xmath156 and @xmath158 corresponds to the 68% confidence interval for @xmath153 for a gaussian distribution . in order to obtain aconservative upper limit",
    "we decide to use both pairs that we actually find ( even though one of these is not within the valid range of separations ) .",
    "for @xmath159 and @xmath160 this yields @xmath161 .",
    "the systematic error due to the three possible extra pairs is @xmath162 .",
    "we can therefore quote a 5@xmath163 upper limit to the pair fraction of @xmath164 ( random ) plus @xmath165 ( systematic ) , for a total of @xmath166 .    as a check",
    ", we estimate the pair fraction in each of the separate 2slaq survey patches : while most regions have no pairs , in one area we find a pair fraction of @xmath167 , which is consistent with the upper limit we derived above .",
    "finally , we can also consider pairs with wider separation in both projected distance and velocity : @xmath168 kpc and @xmath169 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this considerably increases the number of contaminants ( unphysical pairs ) , as shown by p00 and @xcite .",
    "however , this pair fraction may provide a further interesting constraint .",
    "for the 2slaq sample we find @xmath170 .        where @xmath172 is the space density of galaxies in our sample , 0.5 is a factor introduced to avoid double counting galaxies ( 1 pair contains 2 galaxies ) , @xmath173 is the probability that pairs will merge ( assumed to be 1 here ) and @xmath174 is the merger timescale , for which we take the shortest possible timescale set by dynamical friction .",
    "we find that a robust @xmath5 upper limit to the merger rate is : @xmath175 mpc@xmath7 @xmath176 gyr@xmath1 ( including the systematic contribution due to the three extra photometric pairs ) for galaxies with @xmath177 at @xmath3 ( a period of 1.4 gyrs in the history of the universe ) . a more realistic merger timescale and merger fraction may decrease this estimate by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the low dry merger rate we measure here is in good agreement with a number of other estimates : locally , @xcite obtain an upper limit of @xmath31 per gyr for the dry merger rate of sdss lrgs with @xmath178 and @xmath30 , a value which is consistent with ours , albeit for more luminous ( massive ) galaxies .",
    "this is also similar to the dry merger rate of @xmath26 measured by @xcite for sdss lrgs with @xmath66 and @xmath27 .",
    "the integrated dry merger rate for galaxies in the red sequence survey is @xmath179 since @xmath24 over @xmath180 , while @xcite find very low to zero likely dry mergers in goods data at @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless there are some discrepant estimates in the literature .",
    "apparently , the most worrying is the value of @xmath37 per gyr for @xmath38 lrgs from 2slaq derived by @xcite using the small scale correlation function .",
    "however , @xcite use lrgs over the entire range of absolute luminosities in the 2slaq survey , and their sample therefore includes both minor mergers ( luminosity ratio greater than 1:4 ) and less luminous objects . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the merger rate increases significantly for minor mergers and less luminous galaxies .",
    "therefore the larger value derived by @xcite is not necessarily in disagreement with ours .",
    "@xcite apply the same method as we do ( dynamically close pairs ) to galaxies in the deep2 survey and derive an integrated merger rate of @xmath20 since @xmath21 for galaxies with @xmath181 . assuming a flat evolution of the merger rate @xcite , this is equivalent to @xmath179 per gyr . here , the different luminosity ranges sampled , the bandpass difference , and the fact that dry mergers were selected by morphology , rather than by colors and spectral features as we do , may play a role in explaining the difference .",
    "@xcite obtain an integrated dry merger rate of @xmath17 since @xmath24 for galaxies in the combo-17 survey with @xmath182 , while applying the small scale correlation function to the same data , @xcite derive a merger rate of @xmath34 per gyr at @xmath35 . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the space density of objects in these surveys is 20 times greater than ours , and therefore @xcite are sampling considerably less luminous objects than we do .",
    "given the dependence of the merger rate on luminosity @xcite this does not mean that our results are in disagreement .",
    "in addition , @xcite show that the above sample includes both wet and dry mergers , unlike ours where we confirm by spectroscopy that the vast majority of the sample has lrg - type spectra @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite measure an integrated dry merger rate of 30% for lrgs in the ndfws survey between @xmath36 .",
    "this is equivalent to a merger rate of 3.4% per gyr , but needs to be corrected for the higher mean redshift and different space density than the 2slaq sample .",
    "@xcite estimate that this downward revision is about a factor of 10 , which places the result by @xcite in good agreement with ours .",
    "in addition , there are several estimates of the merger rate for all galaxies using asymmetries for the deep2 @xcite and cosmos surveys @xcite , as well as galaxies in the goods fields @xcite , and pairs in the cosmos survey @xcite .",
    "the measured merger rate is approximately @xmath183@xmath34 per gyr for the entire population of @xmath184 galaxies , of which dry mergers are only a subset , which is in agreement with our measurement .",
    "our result is also consistent with the more indirect merger fraction derived from the evolution of the red galaxy luminosity function .",
    "note that , in this case , ` growth ' may take place via the transformation of blue galaxies into quiescent objects , moving on to the red sequence , but without ( necessarily ) any major merging .",
    "@xcite used the 2slaq data to show that the lrg luminosity function evolves passively at @xmath185 , a result confirmed by several other studies @xcite . for @xmath186 lrgs @xcite and @xcite show that these galaxies evolve essentially passively at @xmath11 .",
    "some massive red mergers are observed in distant clusters and groups ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using the pair fraction , @xcite estimated that @xmath187 of massive red galaxies in the cluster ms1054 - 0321 at @xmath188 have undergone a merger to the present epoch .",
    "@xcite calculate that , for groups and clusters in the sdss at @xmath189 , the merger rate for massive red galaxies is @xmath183@xmath190 per gyr .",
    "these are much higher merger rates than we measure , albeit in a much denser environment . assuming that the merger rate scales with density , and since clusters are about 100 times denser than the field , the values derived by @xcite and @xcite are probably not fully inconsistent with our @xmath191 upper limit for field lrgs .      at face value ,",
    "our results are in considerable tension with models of galaxy formation in @xmath9cdm cosmologies where most massive red galaxies grow via dry mergers @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a semi - analytic model to model the quenching of star formation and a standard merger tree , to predict the dry merger rate for galaxies above a characteristic mass ( the mass for which star formation is shut off ) at @xmath11 . for galaxies with @xmath192 m@xmath14 @xcite predict a dry merger rate of @xmath193 mpc@xmath7 @xmath176 gyr@xmath1 , and a typical merger fraction of about 1020% per gyr , almost independent of redshift .",
    "our luminosity range of @xmath68 translates into a mass range of 16 to 5 @xmath194 m@xmath14 .",
    "the upper limit to the merger rate we derive ( @xmath195 mpc@xmath7 @xmath176 gyr@xmath1 , including the ` worst case scenario ' for systematic errors and assumuing all pairs merge on the shortest possible timescale ) is at least a factor of 5 below these predictions .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that dry mergers at @xmath8 are important in the buildup of the red sequence @xcite    on the other hand , the mass fraction in @xmath196 galaxies on the red sequence appears to grow by about @xmath197 since @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also note a deficit of fainter early - type galaxies in their cosmos data at @xmath199",
    ". the main mode of growth of the red sequence at @xmath11 may be via cessation of star formation and morphological evolution in lower mass galaxies @xcite .",
    "we therefore favor a scenario where most massive galaxies are formed quasi - monolithically at high redshift and major mergers are relatively unimportant at @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xcite  cf .",
    ", @xcite for an observational perspective ) .",
    "this is consistent with recent cdm simulations , that downplay the role of major mergers in galaxy formation over the past half of the hubble time and favor minor mergers and internal processes as drivers of galaxy evolution in the last @xmath200 gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , even in these models the more massive lrgs should grow primarily by major dry mergers , a result that appears to be in some conflict with the slow growth observed for these galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the merger rate of dark matter halos and that of their galaxy tracers .",
    "strictly speaking , theory can only predict the former , while the latter depends , at least in part , on complex details of baryonic physics and dynamical friction ( cf .",
    "although our results appear to favor a particular realization of @xmath9cdm models , interpretation must await more detailed and realistic simulations of the stellar components of galaxies and their fate during mergers and interactions .",
    "we warmly thank all the present and former staff of the anglo - australian observatory for their work in building and operating the 2df facility .",
