    "the exceptional role of sne  ia in exploration of the riddles of the universe is a result primarily of the fact that , with certain caveats ,  may be considered as standard candles and serve as a measure of cosmic distance .",
    "the nature of  is , however , still elusive .",
    "the exists only an agreement that they are related to the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs ( wds ) @xcite .",
    "the evolution of close binaries leading to formation of potential precursors of  has been discussed for more than 45 years , starting from the papers of @xcite .",
    "the current status of the problem is considered , for example , in the recent reviews by .",
    "there are two main competing hypothetical scenarios of the evolution of close binaries to : ( a ) the ` single - degenerate ' one ( sd ) , implying the explosion of a co wd that accumulated matter from a non - degenerate donor and ( b ) the ` double - degenerate ' scenario ( dd ) , in which  is a result of the merger of a pair of wd .",
    "other scenarios , such as a merger of wd with the core of a red giant ( core - degenerate one in modern terms ) @xcite or direct collisions of wd @xcite are usually considered to be less important .",
    "we do not consider  induced by tidal interactions of wds with black holes @xcite and resonant ones @xcite , as well as the possible enhancement of  rate owing to dynamical interactions in stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "the topic of the present paper is the double - degenerate scenario .",
    "its main assumption is that the loss of angular momentum via gravitational wave radiation by a close binary with wd components reduces separation of thr wd and leads to the roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) by the lower mass one ( with the larger radius ) .",
    "early simple analytical estimates using mass - radius relation @xcite suggested that for mass - ratio of components @xmath9 , mass - loss by the wd becomes unstable and the latter completely disrupts , presumingly on a time scale comparable to the orbital period of the system , forming a disk that gradually settles onto the wd .",
    "components of the binary thus merge. later , @xcite showed that the stability of mass loss depends also on the efficiency of the tidal interaction in the binary .",
    "sph - calculations taking into account the physical equation of state demonstrated that wd disrupts in @xmath10 and merger occurs in the direct impact regime ( e. g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the early versions of the scenario assumed as precursors of  only pairs of co wd with @xmath11  @xcite , currently , mergers of sub-  systems with co accretors and co , he and hybrid donors ( 0.32  0.60 )  co wd that descend from helium stars and have mass abundances of he up to almost 90% in the @xmath12(0.20  0.01 )  envelopes ; more massive post - he - stars wd have only traces of he in their envelopes . ] are considered too .",
    "the evidence for the necessity of consideration of sub-  was summarized by @xcite .",
    "however , an essential problem that is apparently unresolvable in the foreseeable future is that the disruption of the donor and formation of a quasi - steady configuration are modelled by sph - methods , with resolution @xmath13 cm at best , while models of nuclear burning deal with scales down to @xmath14 cm .",
    "sph - computations allow us only to determine whether the necessary condition of detonation  an energy release time - scale @xmath15 is shorter than the local dynamical time - scale @xmath16  is fulfilled , while the necessary and sufficient condition for self - sustained detonation is the supersonic speed of flame propagation .",
    "if it does not follow immediately from the computations of merger that the latter condition is fulfilled , one has to judge whether detonation is possible , using results of sph - calculations as an input for mesh - based codes of different degrees of sophistication .",
    "the aim is to find whether formation of hot spots in the merger products is possible , that is , to calculate the critical sizes of hot regions that ignite and yield propagating detonations .",
    "the parameters of hot spots ( density , temperature and its gradient , geometry ) for he were found by 1-d calculations by @xcite and for c / o mixture , most recently , by @xcite .",
    "the above circumstance makes the real role of the dd - channel in production of  uncertain .",
    "the aim of the present study is to estimate possible contribution of the dd - scenario to the rate of  and dependence of delay - time distribution for  on this scenario under an _ extreme assumption that all mergers of super-  co+co pairs of wd , as well as mergers of co wd and massive he and hybrid wd result in _ .    in ",
    "[ sec : merger ] we briefly review the extant results of merger computations and show that they are still inconclusive . for this reason , we compute the total rate of mergers of wd pairs with he , hybrid- and co - donors and co or one accretors for different parameters of population synthesis , aiming to estimate the upper limit of contribution of mergers to  rate and , particularly , of different pairs to the latter . in   [ sec : model ] we present the assumptions we use , in   [ sec : res ] our results are presented , followed by discussion in ",
    "[ sec : anal ] and conclusions in   [ sec : concl ] .",
    "some additional information is provided in the appendix .",
    "the merger of wd may proceed through several stages : ( i ) disruption of the less - massive wd and dynamical accretion ; ( ii ) relaxation of the resulting configuration to the quasi - steady state ; ( iii ) evolution of the merger product to a sn or an accretion induced collapse ( aic ) .",
    "merger products have a similar structure @xcite : a cold virtually isothermal core , a pressure - supported envelope , a keplerian disc , and a tidal tail .",
    "if explosion does not happen during dynamical stage of merger , he or c / o - mixture may explode in the envelope which is the hottest part of the object .",
    "detonation of he in the envelope may lead to the detonation of carbon at the periphery of accretor ( edge - lit detonation ) or in its central region which is compressed by converging shocks ( double - detonation ) .",
    "the explosion of a co wd results in its complete disruption . while the mayor fraction of the accretor mass burns to radioactive ni , which determines optical luminosity and spectrum of the , the donor burns to intermediate mass elements which are responsible for observational manifestations of  at maximum brightness @xcite .",
    "thus , the main role of the donor explosion ( or of its remnants after disruption ) is to trigger the detonation of the accretor @xcite .",
    "sub-  ` double - degenerate ' scenario is to a significant extent related to the also still hypothetical ` double - detonation ' scenario with a he - rich donor , either degenerate or non - degenerate , e. g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on a series of 1-d calculations of pure detonations of co wd with post - processing nucleosynthesis and radiation transfer , concluded that sub-   explosions are a viable model for sne ia for _ any _ evolutionary scenario leading to explosions in which the optical display is dominated by the material produced in the detonation of the primary wd .",
    "systematic studies of mergers of wd pairs with he wd or co / he hybrid wd donors and co wd accretors with mass from 0.4  to 1.2  were performed by @xcite and @xcite , using grid - based and sph - codes , respectively .",
    "they found that for he / hybrid+co pairs of wd the condition @xmath17 is fulfilled prior to merger or at the surface contact provided @xmath18  and mass of he - rich donor @xmath19 . in some cases detonation",
    "is due to instabilities in the accretion stream .",
    "it remains unclear , however , whether these surface detonations may initiate detonation in the core . for co+co wd",
    "pairs dynamical burning conditions were met for @xmath20  only .",
    "@xcite studied violent ( see below ) mergers of several pairs of equal and almost equal mass co wd ( @xmath21 ) in which they _ assumed _ , based on computations of @xcite that detonation occurs if , during compression and heating of the matter encountering the accretor , the threshold @xmath22 k at the density of about @xmath23 is reached . as a critical mass ratio for detonation , pakmor et al .",
    "inferred @xmath24 .",
    "having in mind that the traces of he ( @xmath25)should be present at the surface of all co wd and that he is ignited more readily than carbon and , thus , may facilitate nuclear ignition during the merger @xcite , and based on the computation of merger of 1.1  and 0.9  wds with 0.01   he - envelopes , @xcite speculated that he - ignited ( co+co ) wd and ( co+he ) wd mergers may present a unified model for normal and rapidly declining .",
    "the model does not explain  with strongly mixed ejecta ( sn  2002cx type ones ) .",
    "@xcite used the relationship between accretor mass and @xmath26 in maximum for detonating sub-  mass co wd to construct the brightness distribution expected for violent mergers of pairs of co wd by population synthesis . under certain assumptions , the shape of brightness amplitude distribution matches the observations well",
    "however , the model needs further elaboration in respect of nuclear display and spectral features . at the moment",
    ", it is worth to mention that the model encounters serious difficulties in reproducing spectrophotometric features of  because of asymmetries in the distribution of ejecta @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed possibility of post - merger explosions for some previously found configurations , using them as an input for the grid - based 2-d hydrodynamical calculations with account of rotation by the code flash @xcite .",
    "it was found that _",
    "immediately _ after completion of merger detonation does not occur in either he+co or co+co pairs , because of too low a density of hot regions ( envelopes ) . to",
    "the similar conclusion for co+co pairs came @xcite .",
    "however , it was suggested that an insufficient resolution in most computations , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 particles per ) , may be the reason for this @xcite . in test computations with resolution up to @xmath29  in which also",
    "@xmath30 reaction was taken into account , detonation conditions of @xcite , were met by pairs of wd with @xmath31 and @xmath32    one may expect that a further increase of resolution , will allow to resolve smaller hot regions . @xcite also noted that the study of possible mergers at contact for he+co pairs needs a higher resolution , since the occurrence of helium detonation depends strongly on the mass of the helium layer .",
    "this may affect unified model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the criteria of spontaneous detonation discovered by holcomb et al . , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite may be met during evolution of merger products in their most dense and hot regions .",
    "however , because of above - mentioned discontinuity in resolution of sph and mesh - based computations , hot spots were located manually , assuming that the merger products evolved to conditions necessary for detonations .",
    "it was found that he - detonation , may lead or not lead to the detonation in the centre , as well , it was found that the initial perturbation may not initiate detonation in the envelope , but converging shocks may cause detonation in the core .",
    "some of post - merger configurations do not lead to .",
    "@xcite , who also computed the merger of wds by sph , have shown that in the models of merger of co wd with he - envelopes ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) , he detonates in the merger process , but the released energy is not sufficient for initiation of detonation in the core of the merger product . in the continuation of this study , @xcite ,",
    "have analysed possibility of detonation using grid- based code with a higher resolution and showed that secondary detonation is possible , if massive ( @xmath35 ) wd merge .",
    "but we note that , like in the studies of pakmor et al . , these computations rely on artificial ignition of detonation .",
    "the long - term post - merger evolution of the merger product of co wds which avoided detonation at the merger itself was simulated by @xcite using @xmath36-viscosity prescription .",
    "@xcite performed a similar study for a he+co wd merger .",
    "it was found that merger products evolve on the viscous time scale towards spherical configurations . a hot , slowly rotating , and radially extended envelope forms .",
    "certain amount of mass may be lost by the stellar wind . at the end of this stage , owing to dynamical and viscous heating , the temperature at the base of the envelope may become high enough for off - centre burning . in the case of",
    "he / co mergers , it is possible that he - detonation ensues and a  explodes . as argued by @xcite on the basis of 1-d computations , in the case of co wds , if the mass of the object remains below 1.35 , inward propagation of the burning leads to formation of a massive one wd . in merger remnants with higher mass , neon ignites off - centre .",
    "it is expected that a silicon wd forms .",
    "if the mass remains super- , further nuclear evolution will result in formation of an an iron core and collapse , producing a neutron star .",
    "the optical manifestation of an accompanying supernova is uncertain .",
    "in fact , the study of @xcite questions the role of mergers of co wd with mass below @xmath37 as progenitors of  in the dd - scenario .",
    "@xcite have shown ( in 2-d ) that the merger of a pair of ( 0.6 + 0.6 )   co wds produces a rapidly - rotating wd surrounded by a hot corona and a thick , differentially - rotating disk , which is strongly susceptible to the magneto - rotational instability .",
    "instability leads to the rapid growth of the initially dynamically weak magnetic field in the disk , spin - down of the ` new - born ' wd , and to the central ignition of the latter . however , as the outcome of ignition depends on the temperature profile @xcite , this simulation also does not definitely tell whether   explodes .",
    "consideration of magnetic field evolution of merger product of @xmath38  wd @xcite has shown that exponential amplification of the field strengths occurs .",
    "@xcite speculated that magnetic field provides a mechanism for angular momentum transfer and additional heating , facilitating carbon fusion .",
    "however it was pointed out earlier @xcite that , if a keplerian disk forms out of the disrupted component and persists , as a result of the spin - up of rotation of the wd by accretion , instabilities associated with rotation , deformation of the wd , and angular momentum loss by a distorted configuration via gravitational waves , accretion rate onto wd that is initially @xmath39  decreases to @xmath40  and close - to - centre ignition of carbon becomes possible .",
    "this self - regulated accretion mechanism is applicable for pairs with total mass ( 1.41.5)at the onset of carbon ignition ; its timescale is @xmath41yr .",
    "@xcite performed a post - merger evolution simulation for a ( 1.1 + 1.0 )  co+co wd system and found that a spiral - mode instability developed in the accretion disk on the dynamical time - scale and forced hot disk material to accrete onto the core of the remnant .",
    "this process drives a thermonuclear outburst leading to without the need for artificial ignition .",
    "this mechanism works on the time scale which is two - three orders of magnitude shorter then the magneto - rotational instability suggested by @xcite .",
    "thus , a self - ignited detonation may be possible in post - merger stage at least for the most massive objects .",
    "however , follow - up modelling of light - curve and spectrum of the system @xcite led to the suggestion that a better agreement with observables of normal   will require lower masses of components , but whether similar mechanism will be effective for these systems remains an open question .",
    "nevertheless , as noted by @xcite , a wide range of he+co wd mergers may ignite unstable helium burning via the spiral - wave mechanism . an attractive feature of the above - described mechanism is that detonation occurs within @xmath42100s after merger and ejectum will not interact with any significant amount of the matter lost from the disk and produce additional radiation in the early light - curve which may be misinterpreted in favour of the presence of a non - compact progenitor @xcite .",
    "note that at difference to the simulations of  by some other authors , @xcite took as initial models for exploration of possibility of  the ones obtained by computations of wd merger , instead of taking an equilibrium hydrostatic model or a model , obtained by the accretion of he onto co wd . it is assumed initially that wds rotate synchronously @xcite . in the case of non - synchronous rotation , disruption of the lower - mass wd occurs on shorter time - scale ( @xmath4210 ) and is more violent @xcite . in the case of non - synchronous initial rotation ,",
    "nuclear burning starts at larger densities and it is more probable that  occurs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as noted by @xcite , it is likely that in the latter case detonation happens in the centre of the merger product , while in the former case , at the core surface . as a result",
    ", there may be differences in the amount of unburned matter , ejectum velocity and ejectum asymmetry .",
    "however , the issue of initial conditions still remains controversial .",
    "a special case is the still badly explored mergers involving one wd .",
    "if the disrupted dwarf is he - rich , one may expect he detonation followed by core collapse , if the remaining mass exceeds .",
    "such an sn would be classified as a sn  ib .",
    "whether he - detonation can in this case robustly trigger close - to - centre detonation remains an unsolved problem @xcite . speculated that thermonuclear runaway in the core of one wd _ may _ be triggered externally and explored such a detonation .",
    "they concluded that observationally such explosions will be quite similar to  produced by detonations of similar mass co  wd .    to summarize , a clear apprehension of the nature of progenitors of  in the dd - scenario and processes occurring during the merger of wds and in the post - merger stage is currently lacking",
    "for clarity , we reproduce in fig .  [",
    "fig : danmap ] slightly modified  diagram for merging wds @xcite which we split into 13 subregions ( zones ) where the pairs of wd of different mass and chemical composition merge and different outcomes of merger are possible , including .",
    "we set the lower mass limit for possibly detonating he wd at 0.37 ; above this limit detonations in the stream and at the contact are possible @xcite , though , according to @xcite , virialised he  wd even with @xmath43  may detonate . despite the fact that maximum mass of degenerate helium cores of stars slightly decreases with stellar mass @xcite , we use the ` canonical ' value of 0.47  as the lower limit for the masses of co wd produced by agb - stars .",
    "we consider also ` hybrid ' wd .",
    "like for he wd , the lower boundary of the mass range of exploding hybrid wd is set to 0.37 .",
    "since we aim to evaluate the upper limit of  rate provided by merging of wds , we consider as  all mergers of co and he or hybrid wd in which at least one detonation event is expected , though , as it is shown in the previous section , this issue is still open .",
    "it is unsolved , whether all such events will be identified with .",
    "we expect the following events in the zones marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : danmap ] . + * a. * merger of he or hybrid wd with a co wd resulting in he detonation in the envelope and possible subsequent detonation of carbon in the core . + * b. * merger of he or hybrid wd and co wd resulting in detonation of both wd .",

    "@xcite have shown that c - transferring systems do not detonate at contact . + * k. * merger of one wds .",
    "thermonuclear explosion is possible , if the envelopes contain he .",
    "such an event may be classified rather as a sn  ib than a weak .",
    "+ * l. * merger of low - mass he or hybrid wd leading to formation of helium subdwarfs .",
    "no  are produced .",
    "+ * rcb . * merger of he and co wds in which the necessary conditions for he detonation are not met .",
    "hypothetically , such mergers may lead to the formation of r  crb stars @xcite ; evolution of the latter is defined by competition of core growth due to he - shell burning and mass loss by stellar wind .",
    "the growth of the core mass to  and explosion are not very likely , but if they happen , the event would probably be observed as a peculiar sn  ib .    in assigning  status to the outcome of merger , we used , primarily , numerical results and qualitative considerations presented in @xcite , as well as data from literature discussed in   [ sec : merger ] .",
    "accordingly , we consider as  results of mergers occuring in the zones * a * , * b * , * d * , * e * , * f * , and * j * , although we clearly recognize that all of them are still hypothetical .",
    "we note the following .",
    "if detonation of he in the pairs merging in the zones  and  does not initiate co - core detonation , he explosions may be still identified with subluminous  @xcite . in zone * c * mergers do not result in  according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sato16 ] ) ; furthermore , @xmath44 should exceed about 0.8 .",

    "appropriate computations are absent , but it is clear that the ` trigger ' dwarf has to be massive or such events may not happen at all .",
    "thus , our limiting @xmath46  may be too optimistic .",
    "note , however , that the contribution of zone *  j * to the rate of  in the case = 2 , which we consider as giving the best agreement with observations , does not ecxeed 10 per cent ( see   [ sec : res ] ) .      for the modelling of the population of merging wds",
    ", we applied the code bse @xcite .",
    "the advantage of bse is that it is based on a homogeneous system of evolutionary tracks for single stars with metallicity from @xmath47  to 0.02 @xcite , which was used to construct analytical approximations describing stellar evolution .",
    "the shortcoming of bse is that the evolution of binaries is treated on the base of assumptions originating from the work of other authors or ( educated ) guesses for never calculated evolutionary transitions .",
    "our results are based on the modelling of @xmath48 initial systems and for each set of initial parameters represent one realization of the model .",
    "hence , they are subject to poisson noise .    taking into account recent suggestions on the dependence of the binarity rate on the mass of stars , we approximated this rate as @xmath49    _ common envelopes .",
    "_ the problem of common envelopes ( ce ) is the most acute one in the theory of evolution of close binaries ; see for a recent detailed discussion . in the context of the problem we address in the present study , ce form when accretor is not able to swallow all the matter supplied by the donor or the system is subject to the darwin instability .",
    "there is no unanimous opinion on the form of the equation describing the evolution of stars in the ce .",
    "we apply an equation suggested by @xcite , included in bse as an option , because in our opinion , it better accounts the expenditure of energy on the expulsion of the ce than the ` standard ' @xcite equation , if both components have clear - cut cores and envelopes .",
    "however , test runs with ` standard ' equation show that the difference in the rates of  does not exceed 10 per cent .",
    "the basic problem of both formulations of the ce equation is that its solution for the ratio of the initial and final separations of the components , upon which it is decided whether the components merged , depends on the product of two parameters  @xmath50 .",
    "the ` common envelope efficiency ' @xmath51 describes the efficiency with which the spiralling - in cores of components transfer orbital energy to the envelope and disperse the latter ; it is expressed in fractions of the orbital energy of the system .",
    "parameter @xmath52 characterizes the binding energy of the donor envelope .",
    "a problem related to the outcome of the ce was noted by @xcite : while ce equation(s ) may formally imply that the system remains detached at the end of the ce stage , in fact some matter of the envelope may not reach escape velocity and remains bound to the system and form a circumbinary disc .",
    "angular momentum loss owing to interaction with the disk may result in further reduction of the binary separation and the merger of components .",
    "this may influence , among other populations , , but this problem remains unsolved . on the other hand , the influence of this phenomenon is partially compensated by uncertainty in the treatment of ces in general .",
    "both parameters describing the ce are still highly uncertain . for",
    ",  the most important issue is whether there are other sources than orbital energy for expulsion of ces , that is , whether @xmath53  is possible .",
    "in fact ,  is a specific parameter of any ce .",
    "the use of it is forced , because for a given system with components at different evolutionary stages and particular combination of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , the outcome of the ce may be found only by 3d hydrodynamical calculations , which still have insufficient resolution or do not account for all physical processes occurring in ces on different time scales @xcite .",
    "it is evident that @xmath52 should continuously vary in the course of stellar evolution ; position of the core - envelope boundary remains uncertain  the value of @xmath52 may be uncertain by a factor of 10 depending on the definition of the core - envelope boundary @xcite .",
    "regarding ` observational ' estimates , one should bear in mind severe selection effects which may restrict the observed population to fractions of per cent of the intrinsic one , resulting in poor statistics .",
    "nevertheless , we consider it justified to use as a constant parameter the value(s ) of  found for sufficiently representative samples of close binaries that evolved through the ce stage or were derived by the study of particular binaries .",
    "however , it appears , for instance , that for low - mass systems  post - ce binaries ( pceb ) with @xmath57  from sdss  the estimates of  range ( within error bars ) between 0.02 and 10 . within this range , for the systems with agb progenitors",
    ",  values cluster below 0.2 , while for those with fgb progenitors almost all   values are @xmath58 .",

    "<S> using population synthesis , we study a double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario for sne ia , aiming to estimate the maximum possible contribution to the rate of sne from this scenario and the dependence of the delay - time distribution ( dtd ) on it . we make an extreme assumption that all mergers of super - chandrasekhar pairs of co white dwarfs ( wds ) and mergers of co wds more massive than 0.47 @xmath0 with hybrid or helium wds more massive than 0.37@xmath0 produce sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> the models are parametrized by the product of the common envelope efficiency and the parameter of binding energy of stellar envelopes @xmath1 , which we vary between 0.25 and 2 . the best agreement with observations </S>",
