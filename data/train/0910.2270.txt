    "furthermore , the infrared luminosity and radio continuum brightness of the individual h ii regions suggest that some of them may themselves contain more than one massive star . thus , the spatial structure of massive star - forming regions is clustered and hierarchical : the star - forming regions contain a number of separate hc and uc h ii regions , each of which may in turn contain a few massive stars .",

    "the cluster - scale accretion flow can be traced down from the largest cloud scale to the small scale of the brightest h ii region , but it is not known whether this holds for other objects .",

    "this comparison raises the question whether a large - scale coherent flow is required for the formation of the most massive stars , o stars ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) capable of producing bright h ii regions , whereas b stars require only smaller scale flows .",
    "it is also unclear what happens in an accretion flow when the inflowing molecular gas reaches the boundary of an embedded h ii region .",
    "previous observations suggest that the h ii regions in an msfr that are surrounded by accretion flows , may be best understood as deriving from the continuous ionization of the accretion flow @xcite , rather than as a dynamically separate expanding bubble of ionized gas within the flow .",
    "part of the ionized gas may continue to the central star or stars and part escapes off the rotationally flattened accretion flow as a photoevaporative outflow perpendicular to the plane of rotation @xcite .",
    "the outflow is accelerated to supersonic speeds by the density gradient maintained by the stellar gravity @xcite . because the extent of an ionized outflow is generally larger than the region of ionized inflow , in most cases the outflow",

    "h ii regions classified as  broad recombination line objects \" ( brlo ) @xcite show steep density gradients and supersonic flows @xcite , consistent with photoevaporation and acceleration .",

    "the observations of g20.08n reported here and of g10.6 - 0.4 reported previously @xcite suggest that one difference is that the molecular clouds surrounding young clusters of o stars are in a state of overall collapse whereas in star - forming regions without h ii regions we see only localized collapse .    in g20.08n",
    "the h ii regions a , b , and c are surrounded by a common molecular cloud of radius @xmath203 pc and mass @xmath204 , which is rotating with a velocity of @xmath205 @xmath19 and contracting with an inward velocity of @xmath29 @xmath19 .",

    "in contrast , low- and intermediate - mass stars or clusters in their simulation are associated with isolated accretion flows that are a factor of 10 smaller in size , mass , and accretion rate .",
    "if global collapse of the host molecular cloud is necessary for the formation of o stars in clusters , then the association of o stars with galactic spiral arms may imply that compression of giant molecular clouds as they pass through galactic spiral arms may be the primary mechanism for initiating global collapse @xcite .",

    "if the core is to form one or more o stars at less than 100 @xmath67 efficiency , its mass must be resupplied by the larger scale accretion flow .",
    "resupply is also suggested by the short dynamical or crossing timescale , given by the ratio of the size to the infall velocity , @xmath210 yrs . if the core is to last more than this , it must be resupplied by the larger scale flow , which has a dynamical timescale of @xmath211 yrs .",
    "if the core is not resupplied then the growing protostar may simply run out of gas before reaching the mass of an o star .",
    "a similar process of resupply is suggested in recent theoretical work .",

    "@xcite and t. peters et al .",

    "in contrast , the accretion rates estimated for the cores in these msfrs without bright h ii regions are generally lower by one or two orders of magnitude , @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "a high accretion rate is necessary to form an o star . because accreting massive protostars begin core hydrogen burning well before reaching the mass of an o star , they evolve essentially as main - sequence stars of equivalent mass",

    "the accretion flows in g20.08n are capable of supplying gas at the rate necessary to form massive o stars . in msfrs without o stars , the accretion rates may be too low for the stars to achieve the mass of an o star within their hydrogen - burning lifetimes .",
    "if the flow in g20.08n is continuous , then the observations show that the flow spins up as it contracts .",
    "ignoring projection effects , the magnitude of the specific angular momentum on the large scale is @xmath220 pc at @xmath221 pc , from the vla - d nh@xmath0 data , while from the vex sma data it is @xmath222 pc at @xmath223 pc around h ii region a. from these estimates @xmath224 % of the specific angular momentum in the large - scale flow is lost . in previous observations of g10.6 - 0.4 ( keto 1990 )",

    "thus ordered field lines extend from the h ii region - scale accretion flow to the large - scale molecular cloud , and if the field has enough strength , angular momentum could be transferred outward by the field . however , dust polarization observations do not give a direct estimate of the field strength , and it is also possible that the field is essentially passive and just carried along by the flow . the observation that the clouds in both w51e1/e2 and g20.08n are close to free - fall collapse implies that the magnetic field is not strong enough to support the clouds .",
    "in other words , these clouds are magnetically supercritical .",

    "the similar orientations of the flows at small and large scales , as well as their dynamical timescales ( @xmath210 yrs and @xmath211 yrs respectively ) , and masses ( @xmath228 and @xmath229 respectively ) , suggest that , if o stars are forming in g20.08n ( as it is observed ) , then the smaller scales ought to be resupplied from the larger scales .",
