    "radiative corrections to jet production in @xmath6 annihilation have been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "previous calculations were , however , performed for massless quarks . in most practical applications",
    "this is sufficient , since at relatively low energy , the @xmath7 fraction is strongly suppressed , and at high energy ( i.e. on the @xmath5 peek and beyond ) mass effects are presumably suppressed .",
    "nevertheless there are several reasons why a next - to - leading - order calculation is desirable .",
    "first of all , at sufficiently high energies , top pairs will be produced , and mass effects there are very likely to be important .",
    "a second important reason is to understand the relevance of mass corrections due to bottom production to the determination of @xmath8 from event shape variables . as a third point ,",
    "quantities such as the heavy flavour momentum correlation @xcite , although well defined in the massless limit , can not be computed using the massless results of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have recently completed a next - to - leading - order calculation of the heavy - flavour production cross section in @xmath6 collisions , including quark mass effects . as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs ] we show the feynman diagrams for a born term ( a ) , a virtual correction term ( b ) , and two real next - to - leading contributions ( c , d ) .",
    "next - to - leading corrections arise from the interference of the virtual graphs with the born graphs , and from the square of the real graphs .",
    "observe that we always deal with the cross section for the production of the heavy quark pair plus the emission of at least one extra particle ( i.e. a gluon or a quark ) .",
    "the inclusion of virtual graphs with only a @xmath9 pair in the final state is not needed if one only computes 3-jet related quantities .",
    "furthermore , by using available results on the total heavy flavour cross section at order @xmath10 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , one can avoid altogether to compute this kind of virtual graphs .",
    "virtual graphs , besides the usual ultraviolet divergences , which are removed by renormalization , have also infrared and collinear divergences .",
    "these cancel when suitable infrared safe final - state variables are considered .",
    "our treatment of the infrared cancellation is such that the final result is expressed as a partonic event generator , in which pairs of weighted correlated events are produced .",
    "any shape variables can be computed for each generated event .",
    "only infrared - safe variables give rise to a finite distribution .",
    "no arbitrary cutoff is needed in this calculation in order to implement the cancellation of virtual and real infrared divergences .",
    "therefore , one does not have to worry about taking the limit for a vanishing soft cutoff .",
    "thus , this method is similar to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was used there to compute a large class of shape variable distributions for the lep experiments .",
    "we have verified that our calculation has the correct massless limit , by comparing our result with that of the massless calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite for all the shape variables listed there , and for the moments of the energy ",
    "energy correlation , proposed as a benchmark in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "very recently , two calculations have appeared in the literature that address the same problem @xcite .",
    "they both use a slicing method in order to deal with infrared divergences .",
    "we were able to perform a partial comparison of our result with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and found satisfactory agreement . in the older work of ref .",
    "@xcite , a calculation of the process @xmath11 has been given , but virtual corrections to the process @xmath12 were not included . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nlo corrections to the production of a heavy quark pair plus a photon are given , including both real and virtual contributions .",
    "we will give full details of our calculation in a future publication .",
    "in the present letter we would like to present a first application , which could not be dealt with using the massless results .",
    "this is the average momentum correlation @xmath13 defined as [ defr ] r= , where @xmath14 are the feynman @xmath15 of the produced @xmath16 mesons , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath13 is computed at leading order in the strong coupling constant .",
    "the interest in this quantity lies in the fact that it may affect the determination of @xmath4 @xcite , when the tagging efficiency for @xmath19 mesons is determined by looking at both the single - tag and the double - tag events .",
    "a simplified description of how this works is given in ref .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite @xmath13 in the following way [ betterr ] r=. we notice that , thanks to the above form , the contribution of virtual graphs with only a @xmath9 pair in the final state is not needed for this calculation . defining now & = & b + ( ) ^2 c + o(^3 ) , + & = & a+o(^2 ) , where @xmath8 is the @xmath20 , 5-flavour coupling constant evaluated at a scale @xmath21 equal to the annihilation energy @xmath1 .",
    "we have r= b + ( ) ^2 ( c+2ab - a^2)+ o(^3 ) .    in the particular case of the computation of the average momentum correlation , we have treated as massive the heavy quark directly produced from the electroweak vertex .",
    "secondary heavy quarks produced by gluon splitting have been treated as light .",
    "similarly , we have not included graphs in which a light flavour is produced by the electroweak vertex , and the heavy quark pair is produced by a gluon .",
    "although the inclusion of these contributions does not pose any particular problem , we believe that this quantity is the closest to what is usually defined to be the correlation induced by hard radiation . other dynamical correlation mechanisms , arising for example from the production of four heavy flavours , or from the indirect ( e.g. via gluon splitting ) production of a heavy flavour pair in an event with primary production of light quarks can be examined separately .",
    "their influence upon the determination of @xmath22 depends upon a more detailed specification of the experimental setup , such as , for example , on whether cuts are applied that remove soft heavy quarks .",
    ".mass dependence of the coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath7 , @xmath24 and @xmath13 .",
    "the digit in parenthesis ( to be taken as zero if not given ) represents the accuracy of the last digit .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as far as its perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath8 is concerned , the average momentum correlation is a quantity that is well behaved in perturbation theory , and it is also quite small . since its effect is typically of the order of 1% , one may worry that non - perturbative effects , of order @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is a typical hadronic scale ) may compete with the perturbative result .",
    "this is a very delicate problem , since we know very little about the hadronization mechanism in qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem was addressed in the context of the renormalon approach to power corrections .",
    "it was shown there that ( in the renormalon approach ) corrections to the momentum correlations are at least of order @xmath30 , and thus negligible at lep energies .",
    "although this result can not be considered as a definitive answer to the problem , it is at least an indication that power corrections to this quantity are small .",
