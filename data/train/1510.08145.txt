    "one of the main issues that remains to be addressed is if it is possible to use the dmrg method to unbiasedly obtain different excited states with intrinsically fluctuating entanglement entropy for large systems . only when the dmrg method for excited states can overcome the tendency of picking minimum entangled states@xcite among all excited states at a finite energy density , will it establish itself as a powerful tool for studying challenging and fundamental issues in quantum statistics emerging with the mbl phase .    in this article , we report developing a new entanglement dmrg ( en - dmrg ) algorithm to meet this challenge .",

    "we study the driving force of the dynamic phase transition from the mbl phase to the ergodic phase .",

    "our results may provide new insights for understanding the rich physics of the mbl phase and the exotic dynamic phase transition in such systems .",
    "the standard dmrg@xcite created by white is an unbiased and controlled method for obtaining ground state or a few low energy excited states of interacting systems .",
    "the true power of the method is in its way of constructing the hs by using the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix . to target excited states in an mbl system ,",
    "we develop an en - dmrg method based on the standard dmrg with modified initial sweeping process to optimally construct larger hs for these states . during this process",
    ", we use a varying bond dimension to allow a natural development of an entanglement structure for the quantum state , which leads to a rapid convergence of the entanglement entropy . here , we outline the basic steps of the en - dmrg . (",

    "( iv ) after building the hs , we perform the standard sweeping with much higher accuracy for targeting the lowest energy eigenstate of the squared hamiltonian until the targeted state is converged",
    ". one may also use other eigenstate solvers for optimization@xcite .    conceptually important for our en - dmrg method",
    ", we use a varying and larger bond dimension to stimulate the expansion of the entanglement in the initial `` infinite '' and the beginning few dmrg sweeps , which builds the hs for different eigenstates with a range of entanglements .",
    "we start from targeting one state near @xmath6 .",
    "we increase the bond dimension and target more states for the reduced density matrix when the sweeping gets frustrated ( several new wavefunctions have large overlaps with the initial wavefunction at the previous step ) .",
    "once we have built a proper hs for the excited state with its entanglement pattern established , only a few steps of lanczos iterations is required to find an accurate eigenstate using the wavefunction transformation following the standard dmrg@xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is to establish the high accuracy of the en - dmrg for quantum statistics for _ large _ mbl systems as we will demonstrate below , which has not been addressed@xcite . in combining with the ed simulation on the smaller disorder side ( where the dmrg method is not applicable because of the volume entanglement and the similarity for nearby eigenstates ) for the delocalized phase",
    ", we will explore the nature of the mbl phase and its transition .",
    "+     +   +    we study the heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with the following hamiltonian : @xmath7 where the nearest neighbor coupling @xmath8 sets the energy scale and we use open boundary for a better convergence in dmrg .",
    "the @xmath9 are the random magnetic field couplings , which distribute uniformly in the interval @xmath10 with @xmath11 as the strength of random fields .",
    "the ed studies using system sizes @xmath12 established an mbl phase at @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the en - dmrg allows us to study larger systems up to @xmath3 spins , which makes the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit for the mbl phase possible .",
    "all the results are obtained near the center of the energy spectrum .    to demonstrate the convergence of the process for our larger system calculation with @xmath3 at @xmath14",
    ", we show the evolution of the logarithm of the energy variances @xmath15 in fig .",
    "1a for each sweep of the en - dmrg process , which usually is proportional to the energy error of the state obtained by the en - dmrg .",
    "eight different en - dmrg targeting runs are illustrated in fig . 1 from one random disorder configuration , and we use an initial bond dimension @xmath16 and vary it up to @xmath17 during the sweeping process . we find that the @xmath18 starts from around @xmath19 for the first a few sweeps and drops to around @xmath20 within 60 sweeps , where we complete the en - dmrg process to find an energy eigenstate near the target energy @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding bipartite entanglement entropies are shown in fig .",
    "1b , where amazingly we find that entropy @xmath22 is well converged after a few initial sweeps .",
    "as also demonstrated here , the eigenstates we obtain have a reasonable variance of @xmath22 values reflecting different levels of entanglement of the targeted eigenstates .",
    "to benchmark our results at a smaller size @xmath23 and @xmath14 , we show the comparison between eigenenergies obtained using ed ( red star ) and en - dmrg ( blue box ) with a varying bond dimension around @xmath24 , where an excellent agreement is demonstrated for all energy eigenstates in the energy interval @xmath25 near the energy spectrum center for one disorder configuration .",

    "1d , we show their one to one correspondence for entanglement entropy @xmath22 from ed and en - dmrg calculations .",
    "very interestingly , we also find that entropies intrinsically fluctuate for these states with very close energies , and en - dmrg can capture them all precisely . however , due to the unequal appearance of the different eigenstates in en - dmrg runs , one needs to address the ability for en - dmrg to capture the statistics of the system for different physical quantities in comparison with ed results@xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate the success of en - dmrg in this aspect as we present new results below .",
    "* a. the spin polarization and spin - flip *    one of the characteristic features of the mbl phase is that there is a set of localized l - bits , which represents @xmath4 locally conserved and commuting effective spins@xcite . in general , these l - bits are locally dressed versions of the underlying physical degrees of freedom . to address the microscopic nature of l - bits and their evolution near the phase transition , we first examine the probability density distribution function of each spin for large systems . as shown in fig .",
    "2a , we plot the spin - z expectation value @xmath28 for the middle ( @xmath29-th ) site for the en - dmrg obtained eigenstate @xmath30 with total @xmath31 for 1000 random disorder configurations at @xmath3 and @xmath14 ( we take one state from each configuration ) .",
    "it shows a wide distribution with much enhanced appearance near @xmath32 quite different from an ergodic state where the single site distribution should take on values close to the averaged value which is zero here .",
    "we have checked that spins at all other sites show very similar pattern . for comparison",
    ", we first show the probability density distribution @xmath33 in fig .",
    "2b for systems with weak disorder @xmath34 and @xmath35 obtained by ed at @xmath23 averaged over 2000 disorder configurations with 50 states near energy spectrum center from each configuration@xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath33 has the gaussian distribution in the ergodic phase at @xmath34 with a strong peak around the value @xmath36 , which also grows sharper approaching a delta function with the increase of @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution at @xmath37 is quite different with a very broad structure and peaks near @xmath38 , which also shows a very weak @xmath4 dependence .",
    "now we obtain the distribution function @xmath33 for systems with different sizes @xmath23 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 in the mbl phase with @xmath14 using 20000 disorder configurations and one state from each configuration obtained by en - dmrg as shown in fig . 2c .",
    "we see a completely different distribution compared to the @xmath34 result ( but similar to @xmath37 case qualitatively ) , with sharp peaks at @xmath41 demonstrating the violation of eth for this mbl system .",
    "the results are system size independent and fully converged suggesting the same distribution in the thermodynamic limit . by comparing the results obtained by en - dmrg and ed at @xmath23 for @xmath14 ( in fig .",
    "2c ) we also establish that our en - dmrg is unbiased , which reproduces all the different events with the right probability as they appear in the random quantum systems . in the @xmath33 distribution function",
    ", we also see the finite probability density @xmath42 for @xmath36 .",
    "we can understand these regions in a perturbative way .",
    "the perturbation from the xy - coupling in the hamiltonian gives rise to spin - entangled pairs in the near polarized spin background , which we refer to as spin - flip events .",
    "the nonzero probability for @xmath36 is a consequence of these spin - entangled pairs .",
    "we show @xmath43 as a function of @xmath11 in the inset of fig .",
    "2c , which is generally nonzero for finite @xmath11 approximately following @xmath44 on larger @xmath11 side ( we obtain results from ed in the smaller @xmath11 side ) revealing the significance of spin - flip events in the whole mbl phase .",
    "because the probability density @xmath43 is system size independent , then at large @xmath4 limit , there will be a finite density for the spin - entangled pairs .",
    "* b. distributions of entanglement entropy and fluctuation of half system magnetization *    the bipartite entanglement entropy @xmath22 has been extensively used as an effective tool to characterize different many - body states for such an interacting system@xcite .",
    "we compute the von neumann entanglement entropy from all eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath45 as @xmath46 , by partitioning the system in the middle of the spin chain .",
    "different from the general volume law entanglement entropy for ergodic phase on the weak disorder side , the mbl phase at @xmath13 side has the entanglement entropy following the area law , which is the fundamental reason that dmrg can work for such a phase .",
    "we now study the probability density distribution of the entropy @xmath47 for spin system near the energy spectrum center .",
    "we choose the statistical ensemble from at least @xmath48 disorder configurations for dmrg calculations for each @xmath4 . as shown in the fig .",
    "3a , results from system sizes with @xmath23 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are on top of each other , suggesting the same distribution in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the agreement between the en - dmrg and ed results for @xmath23 systems confirms the robustness of en - dmrg in capturing all different states with a wide range of the entropy distribution .",
    "the @xmath47 results in the whole @xmath22 region are converged ( independent of the bond dimension ) except for a couple of data points near @xmath49 , where the dmrg results are a few percent smaller than the ed results for the larger bond dimensions we used .",
    "while this small difference does not change the universal behavior of the @xmath4-independent distribution , the error is caused by the fact that these states are close to product states ( which are slightly harder to be captured by en - dmrg ) .",
    "focusing on the characteristic feature of @xmath47 , we find that @xmath47 is peaked at @xmath50 with a continuous spectrum going into the finite @xmath22 range , and with a second peak at a quantized value @xmath51 .",
    "quantitatively , the @xmath47 value at the second peak is about @xmath52 of @xmath53 , which is only clear in our logarithmic plot . quite interestingly",
    ", the @xmath47 has a smooth plateau feature on the @xmath54 side , but shows a large exponential drop on the @xmath1 side .",
    "similar distributions are obtained for larger @xmath11 , where @xmath47 values goes to zero on the @xmath1 side exponentially fast with the increase of @xmath11 . comparing to the observation of the spin - flip process in the @xmath55 distribution",
    ", we can attribute the @xmath56 peak to these small density spin - entangled pairs crossing the two half systems .",
    "the continuous spectrum comes from the local interaction of spin - entangled pairs with surrounding polarized spins , which partially reduces their entanglement as they become dressed .",
    "the exponential drop of @xmath47 on the @xmath1 side suggests that the events of different spin - entangled pairs getting entangled together or multi - spin resonant states have exponentially small probability for @xmath14 deep in the mbl phase .",
    "our method is also distinctly different from other modified dmrg methods for excited states@xcite as it can accurately describe these rare regions with entangled spins in the center .",
    "+   +    now we show the evolution of the @xmath47 into the ergodic phase by reducing @xmath11 .",
    "the distribution @xmath47 for @xmath14 to @xmath57 are qualitatively similar as shown in fig .",
    "3b , with a peak at @xmath50 and a second peak near @xmath58 .",
    "however @xmath47 shows much enhanced weight at @xmath1 side with reducing @xmath11 ( results at @xmath37 and @xmath57 are obtained by ed ) . at @xmath37 , the @xmath47 shows some different features with first peak moving away from zero to @xmath59 and a long tail at @xmath1 side , which only decays very slowly .",
    "we can still see a weak peak at @xmath0 , which is very broad and about to disappear .",
    "interestingly , these features for @xmath47 at @xmath37 is still quite different@xcite from the gaussian form with a single peak , which is the case for @xmath34 with a sharp peak at the value @xmath60 as we checked .    to further establish the above picture",
    ", we investigate the probability density distribution @xmath61 of the fluctuations of the magnetization of the half system@xcite defined as @xmath62 calculated using the eigenstate , where @xmath63 is the total spin - z component of the half system .",
    "if the half - system cutting through a spin - entangled pair while all other spins are short - range correlated ( or near polarized ) , then we expect the variance @xmath64 .",
    "interestingly , we see that the distribution @xmath61 indeed has a second peak at the quantized value @xmath64 , which can be attributed to the spin - entangled pairs ( local spin flips ) .",
    "the overall structure of @xmath61 is very similar to @xmath47 with the broad continuum at @xmath65 side and a tail into larger @xmath66 side with its magnitude growing with the reducing of @xmath11 . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the second peak is more robust in @xmath61 than in @xmath47 indicating the faster growing of the entanglement near the phase transition for finite - size systems@xcite .    * c. spin spin correlation function and many - body phase diagram *     +   +   and spin - xy @xmath67 correlations obtained from en - dmrg at @xmath68 for @xmath23 and @xmath69 .",

    "that typical spin correlations are decaying fast even for intermediate disorder strength @xmath74 .",
    "however , there are rare configurations where the spin correlations at larger distance are strongly enhanced , which may be related to rare griffiths events@xcite .",
    "the arithmetic average we use here allows the rare griffiths events to have singular contribution to the correlations near the transition region .",
    "first , we show the exponential decay behavior for these correlations in the mbl phase at @xmath68 in fig .",

    "these results clearly establish that there is an intermediate regime around @xmath84 , which has exponential decay spin transfer demonstrated from @xmath67 , while the entanglement grows through correlations of different spin - entangled pairs seen in the power - law @xmath70 correlations .",
    "this is also consistent with the entropy distribution function , where the strong power - law tail develops on the @xmath1 side for these intermediate @xmath11 .",
