    "among all periodic solutions of the planar @xmath1-body problem , relative equilibrium motions  the equilateral lagrange and the collinear euler - moulton solutions  are definitely the simplest and most known .",
    "they are both endowed with an evident symmetry ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ) , that is , they are equivariant with respect to the symmetry group of dimension @xmath4 acting as @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) on the time circle and on the plane , and trivially on the set of indexes @xmath5 . in fact",
    ", they are minimizers of the lagrangian action functional in the space of all loops having their same symmetry group .",
    "hence , @xmath6-equivariant minimizers for the action functional ( given a symmetry group @xmath6 ) can be thought as the natural generalization of relative equilibrium motions .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to apply systematically the @xmath6-equivariant calculus of variations to the planar @xmath1-body problem  with homogeneous interaction potential .",
    "we will develop a theory and describe all the main aspects involved in the @xmath6-equivariant minimization : in particular , the classification of all possible symmetry groups , the description of the main properties of their minimizers and the proof of the fact that @xmath1-body minimizers are always collisionless .",
    "in the past few years some variational methods have been exploited by several authors in the search of new periodic solutions as symmetric minimizers for the @xmath0-body problem ( see e.g. @xcite for some recent results and references , @xcite for more details on the three - body problem or variational methods , and @xcite for a similar approach dating back to the early nineties ) .",
    "a major problem in the equivariant minimization is that minimizers might be _ a priori _ colliding trajectories . to exclude this possibility several arguments have been introduced and used in recent literature . in @xcite",
    "the authors proposed a class of symmetry groups with the property that all local minimizers are collisionless ( groups with the _ rotating circle property _ ) , for the general @xmath7-homogeneous @xmath0-body problem in dimension @xmath8 .",
    "the key - step is a generalization of the averaging technique introduced by marchal and exposed in @xcite . in spite of its generality ,",
    "the main theorem of @xcite can not be applied to some relevant symmetry groups , such as the symmetry group of the chenciner ",
    "montgomery eight - shape orbit @xcite .",
    "besides that of collisions , the major problems occurring in the variational approach are the following : first , the minimum has to be achieved ( this requires the condition of _ coercivity _ of the action functional on the space of symmetric loops ; see  [ existence ] below ) .",
    "this depends on the group @xmath6 and possibly on the angular velocity @xmath9 of the rotating frame ( when we consider these coordinates ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "a group for which the action functional is not coercive for all angular velocities will be termed _ fully uncoercive _ ( see  [ def : fullyunc ] below for the precise definition ) .",
    "as we already pointed out , one has to prove that the minimizer is collisionless ; in particular , this obviously excludes the case when collisions are forced by symmetries .",
    "a group will be termed _ bound to collisions _ if every equivariant loop has a collision ( see  [ btc ] below ) .",
    "finally , it makes sense to investigate whether the minimizer is necessarily a homographic solution , and therefore we would like to exclude those groups for which all equivariant loops are rotating configurations , as @xmath2 and @xmath3 above .",
    "such groups will be termed _",
    "( see  [ homg ] below ) .",
    "since fully uncoercive , bound to collisions or homographic groups are unsuitable to this minimization approach , we are interested in the classification of all the other groups .",
    "our main results are the following theorems :    [ mt1 ] let @xmath6 be a symmetry group of the lagrangian action functional in the @xmath1-body problem . then @xmath6 is either bound to collisions , fully uncoercive , homographic , or , up to a change of rotating frame , it is conjugated to one of the symmetry groups listed in table  [ table : class ] ( rcp stands for rotating circle property and hgm for homographic global minimizer ) .",
    ".planar symmetry groups with trivial core [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ mt2 ] let @xmath6 a symmetry group of the lagrangian in the @xmath1-body problem ( in a rotating frame or not ) .",
    "if @xmath6 is not bound to collisions , then any local minimizer is collisionless .",
    "the sentence `` up to a change of rotating frame '' in theorem  [ mt1 ] requires a few words of explanation .",
    "consider a symmetry group @xmath6 for the lagrangian functional : if , for every angular velocity , @xmath6 is a symmetry group for the lagrangian functional in the rotating frame , then we will say that @xmath6 is _ of type r _",
    "( see the equivalent definition  [ def : typer ] below ) .",
    "this is a fundamental property for symmetry groups .",
    "in fact , if @xmath6 is _ not _ of type r , it turns out ( see  [ lemma : nottyper ] ) that the angular momentum of all @xmath6-equivariant trajectories vanishes ( and thus , that no homographic solution can occur ) .",
    "for example , the dihedral symmetry group used by chenciner and montgomery in @xcite is not of type r and thus , as already remarked in their paper , the figure - eight solution has zero angular momentum .",
    "only three groups are not of type r , for the planar @xmath1-body problem",
    ". we will give a detailed description of each of them in section  [ sym : eights ] , together with their minimizers ; in this way we will partially answer to the open question ( posed by chenciner ) whether their minimizers coincide or not : for two of them ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) the answer is yes ( under certain conditions , see  [ prop : d6d12 ] below ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath6 is of type r , then a suitable choice of the angular velocity of the rotating frame allows us to consider only the minimal groups , listed in table  [ table : class ] .",
    "furthermore , given such a minimal group @xmath6 and a rational @xmath9 , @xmath6-symmetric trajectories ( minimizers in the @xmath9-rotating frame ) yield @xmath12-symmetric trajectories for a different ( generally bigger ) group @xmath12 , which are minimizers in the inertial frame ( see remark  [ rem : typer ] ) . of course , when the group is of type r a key point is to understand whether the minimizer is homographic or not .",
    "this indeed happens every time the rotating lagrange configuration is @xmath6-equivariant . in the opposite cases , whenever the lagrange motion is _ not _",
    "@xmath6-equivariant , it is always possible to find suitable choices of masses @xmath13 and angular velocity @xmath9 such that the minimizer is not homographic ; it turns out that these are hill - like solutions .",
    "we emphasize that our approach to exclude collisions is purely local , as in @xcite .",
    "we do not need action estimates on colliding trajectories : in contrast we shall exhibit local variations around parabolic ejection - collision solutions ( which , as shown in @xcite , are the blow - ups of possible colliding minimizers ) .",
    "this approach brings two advantages : first , it allows the extension of the result in @xcite to a unified treatment of all symmetry groups , and also it works with all @xmath7-homogeneous potentials  actually , this approach can be extended to a larger class of potentials , under only reasonable local assumptions at singularities .",
    "moreover , it allows one to prove existence of collisionless minimizers without any level estimate on the minimal actions of colliding trajectories , that in the literature have been often obtained numerically ( see for example @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our local variations are not suitable to be used in a context where constraints are of a different nature , such as homotopy / homology / topology constraints @xcite .",

    "let @xmath16 be positive real numbers and @xmath17 the configuration space of three point particles with masses @xmath13 respectively with center of mass in 0 , then @xmath18 we will denote by @xmath19 the collision set of the @xmath20-th and the @xmath21-th particle and with @xmath22 , the _ collision set _ in @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath23    let @xmath24 be a subset of the index set @xmath25 and let @xmath26 denote its complement in @xmath27 , then @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "if  [ hh2 ] holds , then it is possible to consider the @xmath0-body problem on the subspace @xmath107 .",
    "finally , condition  [ hh3 ] simply means that all loops are periodic of a period that is sub - multiple of @xmath108 , and therefore up to rescaling time it is possible to define another ( smaller ) group @xmath6 .",
    "we will see later in section  [ sec : typer ] how to use this idea to reduce the number of groups in the classification ( condition  [ hh3 ] is actually equivalent to definition  [ defi : redundant ] below ) .",

    "consider first the group @xmath117 acting canonically on the time circle @xmath118 and the euclidean plane @xmath119 , and trivially on the index set @xmath5 .",
    "the equivariant constraints are the following : for every @xmath120 and every @xmath121 one has @xmath122 .",
    "thus the group is homographic and one can easily verify that the action is an affine function of @xmath123 ; therefore critical points of @xmath124 are the rotating central configurations above ( for every choice of masses ) .",
    "the minimal action is attained on the lagrange motion ( since the lagrange configuration minimizes the potential @xmath31 ) .",
