    "most promising approaches for scalable quantum communication ( qc ) rely on the use of photons as the main carriers of information among remote nodes of quantum networks , where matter - based quantum memories are located  @xcite .",
    "photons , besides being the natural candidate for qc due to their long decoherence time and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated , can actually encode multiple quantum bits of information ( qubits ) into various degrees of freedom .",
    "these include frequency , polarization , linear momentum and orbital angular momentum  @xcite . the possibility of simultaneously exploiting these degrees of freedom  @xcite is becoming increasingly appealing for the faithful mapping of quantum states between light and matter  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question then arises : _ what are the most general photon state manipulations allowed by benchmark optical components ? _ it is of paramount importance to obtain a clear representation of all such state mappings to further develop a truly multi - degree - of - freedom photon state engineering .    here",
    ", we address the problem of whether , by resorting to the symplectic group of optical transformations on spatial transverse - field modes , it is possible to perform arbitrary manipulations on photon states encoded in large , but finite , @xmath0-dimensional superpositions of these modes ( qu@xmath0its ) .",
    "this is relevant for non - dichotomic qc protocols , which include those exploiting multimode squeezing  @xcite and the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light  @xcite . for oam ,",
    "one of its main distinguishing features is the access to , in principle , an infinite - dimensional hilbert space expanded by cylindrically - symmetric paraxial eigenmodes ( e.g. the laguerre - gaussian basis )  @xcite .",
    "spatial encoding conveys several independent channels of information that could be very useful in quantum cryptographic schemes with larger alphabets  @xcite and security enhancement against eavesdropping  @xcite . even for quantum computation applications ,",
    "the high - dimensional aspect would enable to optimize certain computing arquitectures  @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition to perform arbitrary unitary operations on a pure quantum state @xmath3 , consisting of a @xmath0-dimensional superposition of orthogonal eigenmodes @xmath4 , is to modify in a controlled way each of the complex coefficients @xmath5 . in most of the experimental realizations oriented towards the use of spatial degrees of photons for high - dimensional encoding , phase holograms and reconfigurable spatial light modulators",
    "have been employed to approximately manipulate specific combinations of optical transverse modes  @xcite . in practice , however , these elements do not strictly preserve paraxiality but , rather , behave as non - unitary transformations , thus constituting a source of mode noise that eventually destroys the desired large , but finite , multidimensionality of the quantum states to be exploited .",
    "our first main result shows that when these , or any combination of , optical elements belong to the group of symplectic transformations ( which include gaussian operations ) , it is impossible to arbitrarily modify single - photon qu@xmath0it states for @xmath1 , via unitary operations generated by those transforms .",
    "hence , a clear motivation emerges : _ is it possible to find transformations on paraxial modes which allow one to really overcome the limit @xmath2 ? _ our second main result provides a positive answer to this question ; we present a set of non - gaussian operations that truly enable us to arbitrarily manipulate ( up to global phases ) single - photon qutrit ( @xmath6 ) states .",
    "furthermore , this set of operations constitutes a su(3 ) algebra .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : sf ] gives a brief summary of the formalism on symplectic groups and transformations in the optical phase space . in section [ sec : mopm ] we introduce and characterize the most general representation of unitary ( metaplectic ) operators corresponding to all possible optical symplectic transformations that can be performed on transverse field modes .",
    "section [ sec : sqgmo ] provides the first main result of our paper ; we prove that , via the group of symplectic transforms acting on superpositions of paraxial modes , it is impossible to implement operations that change arbitrary qudit states onto any other qudit for @xmath1 . in section [ sec : nggates ]",
    "we extend our analysis to non - gaussian operations on these modes and present new routes towards the aim of truly manipulating arbitrary single - photon qu@xmath0its .",
    "section [ sec : conclu ] concludes the paper with a discussion of alternative approaches to implement controlled gates on single - photons using more than one of their degrees of freedom . a simple optical scheme for a cnot gate exploiting oam and polarization , is proposed",
    "to put in context the class of optical transformations referred to above , it is necessary to start by introducing the symplectic formalism that will be used extensively throughout the paper .",
    "we first recall that the dynamics of classical and quantum hamiltonian systems has an underlying symplectic structure .",
    "symplectic methods have been applied in the theory of elementary particles , condensed matter , accelerator and plasma physics , oceanographic and atmospheric sciences and in optics  @xcite .",
    "fundamental to all of them is the phase space picture .",
    "any classical system with @xmath7 degrees of freedom is described by a set of pairs @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of mutually conjugate canonical variables . in the quantum domain",
    "one can associate to these variables the irreducible set of canonical hermitian operators @xmath10 .",
    "the basic kinematic structure is provided by poisson brackets in the former case and by the heisenberg commutation relations in the latter . by assembling the canonical variables and operators into @xmath11-component vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", the poisson brackets and the heisenberg commutation relations can be cast , respectively , as @xmath14 and @xmath15=i\\omega_{\\alpha,\\beta}$ ] , ( @xmath16 ) , where @xmath17 is the @xmath11-dimensional symplectic metric matrix .",
    "of particular relevance are the real linear canonical transformations among quantum ( classical ) canonical quantities  @xcite .",
    "they preserve the heisenberg ( poisson ) relations and are represented by symplectic matrices @xmath18 , obeying the condition @xmath19 .",
    "the set of all such @xmath11-dimensional real matrices forms the @xmath20-parameter non - compact symplectic group sp(@xmath21 ) .",

    ". given that for any @xmath25 the hermiticity properties and commutation relations of the @xmath24 are conserved , and since @xmath24 act irreducibly on @xmath22 , it follows from stone - von neumann theorem that one can define unitary operators @xmath26 on @xmath22 , implementing @xmath19 , such that  @xcite @xmath27 clearly , all possible transformations @xmath28 are mapped , up to a sign ambiguity , onto @xmath26 .",
    "hence , all density operators @xmath29 transform under @xmath26 as @xmath30 . on the level of wigner functions @xmath31",
    ", this transformation acquires a strikingly simple form : @xmath32 .",
    "within classical and quantum optics , the symplectic formalism has been extensively used both in studying mode - mapping properties of lossless first - order ( paraxial or * abcd * ) systems  @xcite and in characterization of continuous - variable entanglement  @xcite .",
    "an important class of symplectic transforms is that of two - mode systems represented by the symplectic group @xmath33 .",
    "for instance , bipartite gaussian operations , which preserve the gaussian character of the wigner functions , belong to @xmath33 .",
    "let us make explicit the form of all possible @xmath26 when @xmath34 .",
    "they give rise to the unitary metaplectic representation of sp(4,@xmath35 ) acting on @xmath22 .",
    "all these unitary operations @xmath26 are generated by ten hermitian operators @xmath36 , quadratic in @xmath37 , that can be split into two sets  @xcite : passive and active generators .",
    "the passive set encompasses the maximal compact subgroup u@xmath38 : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 , ( respectively @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , are the two annihilation ( creation ) operators for all orthogonal transverse modes .",

    "@xmath48 is again another symplectic transformation @xmath49 , one concludes that the most general metaplectic operator @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath28 is represented by a single exponential of @xmath50 times real linear combinations of any of the above generators : @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and @xmath53 a ten - parameter vector .",
    "when applied to photon number states , the passive ( active ) generators have a well - known interpretation : they conserve ( do not conserve ) photon number . unlike active generators , which require nonlinear photon interactions , passive generators can be implemented with linear optical components : beam splitters and phase shifters . now , despite the exact isomorphism between symplectic transformations on photon number states and spatial modes , they have quite distinct physical implications . to gain insight on how the metaplectic operator  ( [ eq : metaplectic ] ) affects spatial modes , we resort to the wigner representation in conjunction with the stone - von neumann theorem  ( [ eq : stonevonneumannth ] ) .",

    "in other words , one must discard all transformations on  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) giving rise to modes not belonging to @xmath96 .",
    "let us analyze the most important restrictions imposed by unitary operations acting on  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) and generated by the group of transformations @xmath34 .",
    "first , notice that since the general metaplectic operator  ( [ eq : metaplectic ] ) involves ten generators , @xmath0-dimensional superpositions with @xmath98 can not be arbitrarily transformed within sp@xmath99 .",
    "this fact , of course , does not preclude the possibility to manipulate qu@xmath0its with @xmath100 .",
    "a key observation is the recognition that finite dimensional representations of sp(4,@xmath35 ) are necessarily nonunitary , owing to the noncompactness of sp(4,@xmath35 ) .",
    "that is , the noncompact part of sp(4,@xmath35 ) , represented by the active generators  ( [ eq : activeoperators ] ) , is to be excluded from the set of symplectic transformations in order to maintain the subspace @xmath96 finite .",
    "otherwise , the qu@xmath0it  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) would become an infinite superposition of all hg modes under the general action of  ( [ eq : metaplectic ] ) .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath101 be a projector in @xmath96 , so that it fulfills @xmath102 . notice that if the metaplectic operator  ( [ eq : metaplectic ] ) must keep  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) in @xmath96 , then @xmath103 , which implies that @xmath104 .",
    "this last condition should hold for any choice of the parameters @xmath53 in  ( [ eq : metaplectic ] ) , and so it follows that the commutator @xmath105=0 $ ] .",
    "however , this vanishing commutator is incompatible with the presence of the active generators  ( [ eq : activeoperators ] ) .",
    "one is therefore limited to the compact subgroup of sp(4,@xmath35 ) , i.e. to the set of passive generators  ( [ eq : passiveoperators ] ) , to perform unitary operations on  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) leaving the subspace @xmath96 invariant .",
    "this means that the metaplectic operator  ( [ eq : metaplectic ] ) reduces to the passive one @xmath106 , which , now , only contains the four free parameters @xmath107 .",
    "consequently , one must confine to three - dimensional subspaces @xmath96 , with state  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) being a qutrit . in principle , the intervening modes in  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) can have different order @xmath77 .",
    "however , since @xmath108 preserves @xmath77 , this implies that it would then be impossible to attain the mode transformation @xmath109 when @xmath110 .",
    "there is still the possibility that the three modes could have the same order . in this particular case , taking into account that @xmath111 and @xmath112 = 0 $ ] , one can express the action of @xmath108 as @xmath113 .",
    "up to a global phase , there are only three free parameters @xmath114 to carry out the general transformations on the state  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) , which are insufficient even for qutrits ( as they involve , at least , four free real parameters ) .",
    "we have thus proven the following result :    _ proposition.- _ it is impossible to arbitrarily modify the @xmath0-dimensional mode - superpositions of single - photon pure qu@xmath0it states  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) for @xmath1 , via unitary operations @xmath26 generated by symplectic transforms @xmath115 sp(4,@xmath35 ) .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "our proposition is expected to also hold for mixed states .",
    "arbitrary operations on qubits ( @xmath2 ) are not prohibited within the subgroup u(2 ) of sp(4,@xmath35 ) , as it should be  @xcite .",
    "operators @xmath108 acting on higher - than - two mode superpositions  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) restrict the possible values of coefficients @xmath95 ; the higher the value of @xmath0 the larger the number of constraints on @xmath95 . in fact , it is easy to show that , within sp(4,@xmath35 ) , the most general _ finite _ superpositions  ( [ eq : qudit ] ) reduce to the well - known dicke or spin coherent states  @xcite ( which depend only on two real parameters , leaving aside global phases ) . although we have identified spherical and cylindrical lenses as the main optical elements of sp(4,@xmath35 ) , the above proposition also affects phase holograms belonging to the metaplectic representation of sp(4,@xmath35 ) .",
    "not all unitary and paraxial transformations are in such representation .",
    "it is an open question to determine the entire class of unitary operators outside the metaplectic representation of sp(4,@xmath35 ) that leave invariant the bases of paraxial modes ; but it would definitely fall into the category of non - gaussian operations . in the next section we partially clarify this question ; we find examples of non - gaussian operations which preserve paraxiallity and allow us to overcome the limit established by the preceding proposition .",
    "moreover , since laguerre- and hermite - gaussian bases are unitarily connected , our proposition also establishes the impossibility to achieve arbitrary qu@xmath0it gates on multi - dimensional superpositions of modes bearing oam .",
    "given that the concept of oam of light is only strictly meaningful within the paraxial approximation  @xcite , encoding photons in non - paraxial modes would generally couple polarization and oam making most qc tasks in such scenarios extremely difficult .",
    "in contrast with gaussian operations , non - gaussian operations remain to be fully explored .",
    "it has been recognized that non - gaussian operations could represent an advantage to perform some quantum information tasks .",
    "non - gaussian operations on continuous variables allow the access to results beyond no - go statements concerning gaussian operations .",
    "for instance , quantum speed up is impossible for harmonic oscillators by gaussian operations with gaussian inputs  @xcite .",
    "distillation of gaussian bipartite entanglement is also impossible by performing only gaussian local operations and classical communication based on homodyne detection and requires non - gaussian operations  @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated that entanglement between gaussian entangled states can be increased by conditional subtraction of single photons from the gaussian beams  @xcite . for universal quantum computation with continuous variable cluster states",
    "@xcite it is necessary , at least , one non - gaussian projective measurement .    in the present scenario ,",
    "our preceding proposition imposes a restrictive limit for gaussian operations on arbitrary superpositions of spatial mode states .",
    "however , in this section , we report a new class of non - gaussian operations which enable us to fully manipulate superpositions of three - level states ( qutrits ) , beyond the restrictions imposed by our above no - go proposition .",
    "furthermore , this class of operations forms a complete set of single qutrit gates fulfilling a su(3 ) algebra .",
    "consider the eight following generators acting on the hilbert space of hermite - gaussian modes : @xmath116 .",

    "their structure resembles that of fully - quantum interaction hamiltonians found in nonlinear parametric processes .",
    "notice that the triad of generators @xmath125 corresponds to the su(2 ) group in eq .",

    "in contrast with @xmath128 , the action of @xmath132 and @xmath133 on @xmath135 gives rise to a new feature : non - conservation of the mode order .",

    "in spite of the stringent limits raised by our results of section  [ sec : sqgmo ] , we have clearly shown how non - gaussian operations can circumvent most of those difficulties .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that there exist other alternative approaches , exploiting the spatial encoding of light , to fully manipulate higher - than - two - dimensional hilbert spaces for various quantum information tasks .",

    "there are several possible routes , such as with space - variant optical axis phase plates made of nematic liquid - crystals  @xcite , or using a mach - zender configuration  @xcite",
