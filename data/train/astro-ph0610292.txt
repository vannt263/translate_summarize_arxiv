    "at the end of 1970s astronomers provided observational evidence that galaxies in the universe are distributed inhomogeneously .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys show that the galaxies form structures such as voids , clusters and filaments .",
    "although this is only the distribution of visible matter , there are some strong indications that visible matter does trace the distribution of dark matter , so real matter distribution is similar .",
    "all these structures evolved from small initial fluctuations which started to grow after the last scattering moment .",
    "however , diffrent structures evolved in various ways , depending on their environment and neighborhood .",
    "the present - day density contrast [ eq . ( [ dencond ] ) ] of overdense regions is larger than 1 @xcite and inside voids it decends to -1 @xcite .",
    "thus , these structures must be described by exact solutions of the einstein equations without such assumptions as small value of a density contrast .",
    "this paper provides the analysis of cosmic structures evolution which is free of such assumptions .",
    "the evolution of the cosmic structures in diffrent environments is investigated by employing the quasispherical szekeres model which is an exact solution of the einstein field equations .",

    "[ tripstr ] presents the connection between the results obtained in the szekeres model and the real large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "for our purpose it is convenient to use a coordinate system which is different from that in which szekeres @xcite originally found his solution .",
    "the metric is of the following form @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an arbitrary function of @xmath5 .",
    "the function @xmath6 is given by : @xmath7 where the functions @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 satisfy the relation : @xmath12 but are otherwise arbitrary .    as can be seen from ( [ ds2 ] )",
    ", only @xmath13 allows the model to have all three friedmann limits ( hyperbolic , flat , and spherical ) .",
    "this is induced by the requirement of the lorentzian signature of the metric ( [ ds2 ] ) .",
    "as we are interested in the friedmann limit of our model , i.e. we expect it becomes a homogeneous friedmann model at a large distance from the origin , we will focus only on the @xmath14 case .",
    "this case is often called the quasispherical szekeres model .    applying metric",

    "although the @xmath18 function in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is a function of all coordinates , it can be shown that the density can be decomposed into two parts : the monopole distribution and the part which has a dipole structure @xcite :    @xmath19    the function @xmath20 is another arbitrary function defining the szekeres model . by analogy with the newtonian energy conservation equation , eq .",

    "this means that the big bang is not a single event as in the friedmann models but occurs at different times for different distances from the origin .    as can be seen the szekeres model",
    "is specified by 6 functions . however , by a choice of the coordinates , the number of independent functions can be reduced to 5 .",
    "the equations of motion @xmath26 are reduced to the continuity equation :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the scalar of expansion and is equal to    @xmath29    in the expanding universe @xmath28 is positive so the density decreases .",
    "the structures which exist in the universe , emerged either due to slower expansion of the space ( formation of overdense regions ) or due to faster expansion ( formation of underdense regions ) . in the friedmann limit @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the scale factor and @xmath32 .",
    "the szekeres model is known to have no symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is of great flexibility and wide application in cosmology @xcite and in astrophysics @xcite , and still it can be used as a model of many astronomical phenomena . in this paper",
    "it will be employed to study the evolution of cosmic structures in different environments .      to compare the evolution of different models the change in their density contrast is going to be considered .",
    "two different types of density contrast indicators are taken into account .",
    "the first one is a usual density contrast defined as follows :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the background density .    however , the density contrast defined as above is a local quantity and is not covariant with the coordinate transformations .",
    "the spatially invariant density contrast can be defined as follows @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "this family of the density contrast indicators can be considered as local or global depending on the size of @xmath38 .",
    "such a quantity not only describes the change of density but also the change of gradients and the volume of a perturbed region .",
    "so this density indicator describes the evolution of the whole region in a more sophisticated way than the @xmath39 .",
    "here only the case @xmath40 will be considered .",
    "all models presented in this paper are calculated numerically as , unfortunately , the class of models described by an analytical solution is not sufficiently enough to describe the considered cosmic structures . however , in the @xmath14 ( and in the @xmath41 ) case the @xmath42 coordinates have an infinite range .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to use a diffrent coordinate system where coordinates do have a finite range .",
    "the surface of constat @xmath43 and @xmath5 can be represented by a stereographic projection employing the stereographic projection we can map the infinite surface of @xmath42 coordinates to a surface of a sphere which has a finite range of coordinates @xmath44 .",

    "hence , every @xmath43 = const and @xmath5 = const slice of the szekeres @xmath14 space ",

    "models with @xmath118 const are known to describe growing modes only @xcite , so the assumption that @xmath118 const seems very natural .",
    "if we set @xmath25 and specify @xmath60 , then @xmath20 is already specified by the einstein equations . on the contrary , if we set @xmath25 and specify @xmath20 then the @xmath60 is already fixed . therefore , for the class of models which evolve from small initial fluctuations and do not have shell crossings during the evolution , as well as reproduce structures similar to the observed cosmic structures , the conclusions drawn at the end of section [ evoqnez ] are valid .",
    "however , it can now be seen that it is not the mass fluctuations that matter but the expansion rate .",
    "higher mass in the perturbed region slows down the expansion rate  this is a condition hindering the evolution of cosmic voids . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mass of perturbed region is below the background mass , such region expands much faster than the background , leading to the formation of the large underdense regions .",
    "such large voids enhance the formation of large elongated overdensities formed at the edges of voids , which are usually called walls .     ratio .",

    "the models presented above are models of two structures embedded in the homogenueous universe .",
    "although the universe is much more complicated than that , such simple models enable us to come to some general conclusions . in this section",
    "the triple structure is considered and it will be seen that the behaviour of the evolution of cosmic structures in this model is similar to this observed in the previous models .",

    "[ fig9 ] presents the density distribution .",
    "there is an overdense region at the origin , followed by a small void which spreads to a larger r. at a larger distace from the origin , the void is huge and its larger side is adjacent to an overdense region .",
    "this is diametrically different to what happened close to the origin where the void adjourns to the supercluster only with a narrow cusp .    the evolution of model 5 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . for clarity fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] presents only the profile which is represented by the @xmath120 line in fig .",
    "this profile is shown for 5 diffrent time instants .",
    "as can be seen , at a larger distance from the origin , where the void is large , it evolves much faster and exceeds the speed of the evolution of the underdense region close to the origin .",
    "another significant fact is that the overdense region connected by the void across a larger area evolves much faster than the supercluster at the origin which is more compact .",
    "this model exhibits the features of the models previously considered .",
    "thus , it might be speculated that the evolution of the real structures follows similar patterns .",
    "namely , small voids in the universe which are surrounded by large high density regions evolve much slower than the large isolated voids . from the perspective of the continuity equation",
    "the expansion of the space in this region is very slow and this is the reason why the voids do not evolve as fast as they could . on the other hand ,",
    "the expansion is much faster inside large voids , where the mass of the perturbed region is below the background mass ( @xmath77 ) . in",

    "the galaxy redshift surveys show that the universe is patchy with various structures .",
    "these structures include small voids among compact clusters , superclusters and large voids surrounded by large walls or long filaments .",

    "the szekeres model is one of the most complex and spatially inhomogeneous exact solutions of the einstein field equations and it has a potential to be more widely used in cosmology .",
    "since it is an exact solution of einstein s equations , it enables to investigate the evolution of cosmic structures without such approximations as linearity and small value of density contrast .",
    "moreover , the szekeres model is flexible enough to describe more than one structure .",
    "having investigated various models with two or three structures within one frame it may be concluded that the evolution of the cosmic structures depends on the environment .",
    "in perturbed region which mass is below the background mass the amplitude of the expansion s fluctuations is large and as can be seen from the continuity equation [ eq .",
    "( [ coneq ] ) ] , such conditions enhance the evolution of cosmic structures .",
    "the analyses presented in this paper indicate that small voids among large overdense regions do not evolve as fast as the large voids do .",
    "this is because the expansion of the space is faster inside large voids than inside smaller voids .",
    "moreover , this higher expansion rate inside the large voids leads to the formation of large and elongated structures such as walls and filaments which emerge at the edges of these large voids .",
