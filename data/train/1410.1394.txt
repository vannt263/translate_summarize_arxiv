    "electromagnons are collective spin excitations occurring in many magnetoelectric multiferroics , contributing to their dielectric response and potentially also to the magnetic one@xcite .",
    "they appear frequently in the thz - range spectra below phonons , and they are frequently understood as spin waves excited by the electric component of the incident electromagnetic radiation ; more precisely , they contribute to the off - diagonal components of the magneto - electric susceptibility tensor .",
    "although electromagnons were observed in a variety of multiferroics , there is still no universal microscopic theory which would explain the mechanisms giving rise to electromagnons .",
    "depending on the crystalline and magnetic structure , the magnons can be activated in the thz - range dielectric spectra by one of the following magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms : the magnetostriction @xcite , inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite or spin - dependent hybridization of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in one material , the magnetoelectric coupling mechanism leading to activation of electromagnons can be different from the one giving rise to the static spin - induced polarization .",
    "for example , in the well - known multiferroic @xmath8 , the polarization is induced by the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya mechanism , while at least some electromagnons are activated by magnetostriction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is still unclear how the electromagnons exhibiting a wavevector off the brillouin - zone ( bz ) center can be excited by the incident photons with wavevectors near the bz center , @xmath9 ; it seems that this may be allowed by the modulation of the magnetic structure . generally speaking",
    ", the electromagnons as excitations which are both electric- and magnetic - dipole active reveal the dynamical features of the magnetoelectric coupling @xcite , and studying their temperature- and magnetic - field - dependent properties may provide insight into the symmetry of the spin subsystem of the materials .    among the many spin - driven multiferroics which have been studied intensively in the last years , the mixed - valence manganate @xmath10 distinguishes itself by several prominent features .",
    "at low temperatures , the material exhibits a strong magnetoelectric @xcite and magnetoelastic @xcite coupling .",
    "the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization saturates at @xmath11 below the temperature of 40k , which represents the highest value among the currently known magnetically driven ferroelectrics @xcite . as a consequence of the magnetoelectric coupling , the polarization decreases in external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the spins of the mn ions are arranged in a way giving rise to a so - called ferroaxial ordering , corresponding to a spiral arrangement of the spins with a chiral symmetry @xcite . in different studies , all the three interactions cited above were identified as the dominant coupling mechanism leading to the exceptionally high electric polarization @xcite .",
    "there is no clear agreement about the respective contributions of these mechanisms as yet .",
    "moreover , the record value of @xmath12 for a multiferroic material requires an explanation , which appears to be a challenging task .",
    "the usual way of identifying electromagnons consists in measuring the polarization - sensitive spectra of the infrared ( ir)-active excitations polarized along all the crystallographic axes @xcite . in this case ,",
    "selection rules for the polarization of both the electric and the magnetic vectors of the electromagnetic radiation must be taken into account .",
    "electromagnons can be also distinguished from phonons or purely magnetic active spin waves ( magnons ) using measurements of the so - called directional dichroism @xcite .",
    "both these approaches fail if sufficiently large crystals ( thin slabs with two faces of typically several @xmath13 ) are not available .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that in such a case , the electromagnons can be recognized using a combination of unpolarized ir spectra and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) .",
    "if there are ir - active excitations activated below a magnetic phase transition temperature , which receive dielectric strength from polar phonons , and if these excitations are observed as magnons in the ins spectra , then these excitations can be attributed to electromagnons . in view of this method",
    "we have studied , using fourier - transform ir ( ftir ) , time - domain thz and ins spectroscopies , the low - energy spectra of polycrystalline @xmath10 , in a broad temperature interval from 2 to 590k .",
    "at high temperatures , @xmath10 has a cubic symmetry with the space group @xmath14 .",
    "the atomic arrangement can be considered @xcite as a variant of the perovskite structure with a set of regularly alternating four @xmath15 units and a sum formula @xmath16 .",
    "this phase features two different mn positions ; one occupying the oxygen octahedra centers with a mixed valence of 3.25 , and one placed in the perovskite cube corners , exhibiting a valence of 3 @xcite . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the compound undergoes a charge - ordering metal - insulator @xcite phase transition to a phase with a rhombohedral structure ( space group @xmath18)@xcite . in this phase ,",
    "the mixed - valence mn atoms shift into two wyckoff positions9d and 3b , displaying valences of + 3 and + 4 , respectively ; the two kinds of octahedra are subject to two different jahn - teller distortions@xcite .",
    "the next phase transition at @xmath19 gives rise to mn orbital ordering @xcite . at the same time , an incommensurate structural modulation along the @xmath20-axis @xcite with a propagation vector @xmath21 appears @xcite . on further cooling ,",
    "the crystal undergoes two magnetic phase transitions . at @xmath22 , a long - range helical antiferromagnetic order with a magnetic superspace group @xmath23 ( ref .  ) and a spin - induced ferroelectric polarization develop @xcite ; the magnetic propagation vector @xmath24 is temperature - independent @xcite .",
    "the orbital modulation was identified as one of the key elements stabilizing the helical magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "below @xmath25 , a different antiferromagnetic phase is observed , where the magnetic ordering can be described by two temperature - dependent propagation vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "these are parallel with the @xmath20-axis , and their average is equal to @xmath28 . near @xmath29 , a temperature hysteresis of the magnetization was detected.@xcite",

    "the latter observation was interpreted in terms of superparamagnetic clusters , which could be also at the origin of the @xmath31 hysteresis@xcite .",
    "according to earlier published works , it is very difficult to produce single crystals substantially larger than a fraction of a cubic millimeter , @xcite which would be necessary for spectroscopic studies with incident waves polarized along the crystallographic axes .",
    "therefore , such studies must be performed on polycrystalline or powder samples only .",
    "our @xmath10 powder was prepared by the modified pechini method using calcium and manganese nitrates in a stoichiometric ratio , ethylene glycol and water .",
    "the solution was slowly heated up to 250@xmath32 , the resulting black foam was ground and the powder was annealed at 830@xmath32 ( 24h ) , 930@xmath32 ( 48 h ) and 950@xmath32 ( 48 h ) with intermittent grinding .",
    "subsequently , the powder was uniaxially pressed at 400mpa ( 3 min ) to a pellet with a diameter of 12 mm and sintered at 950@xmath32 for 48 h. the density of the pellet was about 80% of the single crystal value .",
    "its phase purity was verified by means of powder x - ray diffraction , excluding other stoichiometry than @xmath10 beyond one weight per cent .",
    "the pellet was thinned down to a thickness of 0.36 mm and optically polished .",
    "ir reflectance and transmittance measurements with a resolution of 2 and 0.5@xmath33 , respectively , were performed using the ftir spectrometer bruker ifs-113v .",
    "an oxford instruments optistat optical cryostat with polyethylene windows was used for sample cooling down to 10k , and a liquid - he - cooled si bolometer operating at 1.6k served as a detector . for measurements at high temperatures , a high - temperature cell ( specac p / n 5850 ) was used .",
    "far - ir transmittance with an applied magnetic field was measured using another bruker ifs-113v spectrometer and a custom - made cryostat with a superconducting magnet .",
    "this setup allowed measurements at 2 and 4k in the faraday geometry with an external magnetic field of up to @xmath34 .",
    "time - domain thz spectroscopy was performed by measuring the complex sample transmittance using custom - made spectrometers based on ti : sapphire femtosecond lasers ; one with an optistat cryostat , used for measurements without magnetic field , and one with an oxford instruments spectromag cryostat , enabling measurements with @xmath35 . here , the voigt configuration was used ; the electric component of the thz radiation @xmath36 was set parallel to @xmath37 .",
    "reference measurements with an empty aperture , enabling a reliable determination of the transmittance , were performed systematically at each value of applied magnetic field .",
    "the same results , within the experimental accuracy , were obtained also for @xmath38 .",
    "ins experiments using about 3 g of loose @xmath10 powder were performed first at 10k in the in4 time - of - flight spectrometer at the institut laue - langevin ( ill grenoble , france ) , and within temperatures from 10 to 590k using the mari time - of - flight spectrometer at the isis facility , rutherford appleton laboratory ( uk ) .",

    "the red dotted line in part ( c ) shows the low - frequency wing from the phonons at frequencies above 90@xmath33 , obtained from fits . ]",
    "the most interesting changes related to the magnetic ordering occur in the frequency range below 80@xmath33 ( 10mev ) ; they can be well observed in both the ftir and the thz transmittance spectra .",
    "whereas the ftir transmittance offers a higher sensitivity especially for photon energies above 7mev and a better spectral resolution , the measured absorption lines are overlapping with the interference patterns ( i.e. , the periodic oscillations seen in fig .  [ fig : lowfallt]a ) arising from multiple reflections of the far - ir waves on the parallel sample surfaces .",
    "by contrast , the thz time - domain spectroscopy directly reveals the complex optical constants up to 9mev , it avoids the interferences by separating the multiple reflections in time , but it is difficult to achieve a good resolution of narrow spectral lines .",
    "thus , using both these complementary techniques is the best approach for obtaining a detailed spectral information in the far - ir range .",
    "[ fig : lowfallt]a shows the far - ir transmittance as a function of temperature . upon cooling ,",
    "between 300 and 200k , the transmittance slightly increases due to a decrease in the phonon damping and the related losses .",
    "in contrast , below 200k , a decrease in the transmittance occurs . at first",

    "is seen near 28@xmath33 .",
    "analogous changes occur in the spectra of the complex refractive index obtained by thz spectroscopy ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : lowfallt]b , c ) .    both ftir transmittance and thz spectra",
    "were fitted assuming a sum of lorentz oscillators describing a dispersion in the dielectric permittivity only .",
    "we are keenly aware that this is a rough simplification . whereas this model is perfectly valid for phonons , i.e.  excitations located approximately beyond 90@xmath33 , the lower - frequency ones can contribute , to some extent , also to the magnetic permeability .",
    "furthermore , the model of a sum of harmonic lorentz oscillators is not exact in magneto - electric multiferroics , since the off - diagonal components of the magneto - electric susceptibility tensor contribute to the complex index of refraction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we used the classical oscillator model to describe the dispersion in @xmath49 , similarly to earlier works ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , which allowed us to determine quantitatively the parameters of all observed excitations .",
    "careful simultaneous fitting of the ir transmittance , ftir reflectivity and thz spectra implies that while there is a single absorption mode near 50@xmath33 , the shape of the spectra near 30 and 75@xmath33 is such that for their correct modelling , a doublet for each of these regions is required",

    "( i.e. , oscillator strengths @xmath50 ) and damping constants @xmath51 of the modes below 60@xmath33 near @xmath5 and @xmath29 suggest that these are connected with the magnetic order ( see fig .",

    "interestingly , the mode seen near 50@xmath33 is clearly present with a high damping also in the spectra in the paramagnetic phase at least up to 200k . as for the doublet near 75@xmath33 ,",
    "the sensitivity of our experimental methods is somewhat lower in this region , but the two modes can be clearly discerned at 10k . even at higher temperatures ,",

    "first , the frequencies of the modes shift slightly ; if a field of @xmath57 t is applied , the modes at 48@xmath33 and 28@xmath33 harden by about 1@xmath33 , whereas the one near 27@xmath33 softens by about 1.5@xmath33 .",
    "second , additional weaker but clearly observable satellites arise progressively around 55 and 30@xmath33 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fir - b ] ) . whereas the position of the satellite near 55@xmath33 is independent of the magnetic field , the splitting of the one appearing near 30@xmath33 increases up to ca .",

    "the shapes of the individual lines , contributing to the absorption at this value of @xmath55 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fir - b]c .",
    "such a splitting corresponds qualitatively to a behavior which was theoretically predicted @xcite for multiferroics with a spiral arrangement of spins .",
    "the absorption peaks observed for energies below 10mev can , in principle , be due to phonons or magnons ; the changes in the spectra with temperature and magnetic field provide indications for either of these types .",
    "the doublet at 75 and 78@xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : freq-4k - b ] ) is likely due to polar phonons , because it is active already at 300k . however , one of these modes can be also partly due to a spin excitation , since the magnon density of states ( dos ) exhibits a broad maximum in this energy range ( see the discussion of the ins data below ) . in the rhombohedral phase ,",
    "25 modes ( including these two ) are observed , while the crystal symmetry allows up to 26 zone - center phonons ( see eq .  [ trigonal - anal ] ) .",
    "the missing mode can be weak or overlapping with another one . at @xmath58",
    ", @xmath10 undergoes a structural phase transition to an incommensurate structure , where 12 new modes appear in the spectra ; this kind of transitions is known to activate polar phonons due to folding of the bz @xcite . among them , there are the modes below 60@xmath33 which we attribute to spin waves owing to the significant changes in intensities and dampings they exhibit near the magnetic phase transitions and splitting in external magnetic field .",
    "further confirmation of the magnetic character of these modes was obtained by ins .",
    "the oscillator strengths of the excitations below 80@xmath33 increase below @xmath5 and @xmath29 , whereas some phonon oscillator strengths decrease below these critical temperatures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowf - modes]b ) .",
    "some changes in the oscillator strengths can be caused by mode splitting near 100k which clearly occurs for phonons above 95@xmath33 . at the same time",
    ", it is very likely that some strength is also transfered to the newly appearing excitations , which must have a magnetic nature , as discussed above .",
    "this would be a signature of dynamic magneto - electric coupling .",
    "therefore , the observed low - frequency excitations are likely to be electromagnons .",
    "a definite confirmation of the electromagnons could be obtained only by an analysis of polarized thz and ir spectra of single crystals , which are currently not available .      in a polycrystalline sample , it is not possible to determine directly the phonon and magnon dispersion branches in the bz . instead",
    ", the data obtained by ins correspond to an orientation - averaged scattering function @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total momentum transfer and @xmath61 the energy transferred from the neutrons to the crystal lattice . beyond the quasielastic neutron scattering ( qens ) region , delimited by the energy transfer of @xmath62mev , three scattering intensity maxima",
    "are observed at 10k for @xmath63 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ins]a ) ; they occur near @xmath64 , 6 and 10mev , in a very good agreement with the frequencies of the modes observed in ir transmittance and thz spectra ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lowfallt ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that upon heating , this scattering zone becomes broader but it can still be detected up to @xmath65 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ins]b ) .",
    "the magnetic character of these excitations is unambiguously established @xcite by the fact that the scattering intensity of magnons decreases with increasing @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast , the phonons can be observed at higher values of @xmath60 ; in our case , they were detected at @xmath66 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ins]c ) . by integrating @xmath59 over a low-@xmath60 interval for different temperatures ,",
    "one can obtain the magnon dos ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ins]d ) . in general , the peaks in the dos correspond to extremes of magnon branches , i.e. , to magnons either from the bz center , bz boundary or to a minimum of a magnon branch if the magnetic structure is modulated .",
    "it is well known that electromagnons can be activated in the ir spectra just at these wavevectors @xcite .",
    "therefore , all the available evidence supports the hypothesis of electromagnon modes in our spectra .",
    "furthermore , one can see a weaker magnon signal in the ins spectra peaking around 20mev and @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ins]c ) .",
    "we attribute this signal to two - magnon scattering , which corresponds to the observed maximum in the ins intensity at 10mev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ins]a ) .",
    "alternatively , the weak magnon maximum could be due to one - magnon scattering ; one can find also a matching vibrational mode near 20mev in the ir spectra ( figs .",
    "[ fig : irrefl ] and [ fig : mody - t ] ) . however , its oscillator strength seems to be too high for a magnon and the shape of the reflectivity spectra does not correspond to a magnon @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ( electro)magnons probably exist up to about 10mev only .    .",
    "the data come from the isis facility except the part ( a ) which was measured in ill . ]    . ]    whereas the existence of the lower - energy magnon band ( near 3mev ) in the ir - active spectra is clearly limited to the phase with long - range magnetic ordering which exists below @xmath29 , the mode near 6mev is strong below @xmath5 but it weakly persists far above @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lowfallt ] ) , as does the magnetic - field sensitive mode near 9mev .",
    "these observations lead us to the conclusion that some kind of short - range magnetic ordering exists even if the long - range magnetic ordering is suppressed by the thermal vibrations .",
    "an analogous observation of short - range magnetic order , persisting 15k above the nel temperature , was reported recently for non - stoichiometric multiferroic @xmath68@xcite with @xmath69 ; to our knowledge , no such effect was observed yet for the stoichiometric compound with @xmath70 .",
    "we suppose that the absorption maxima near 6 and 9mev might be linked to short - wavelength ( high - wavevector ) magnon modes situated near the bz boundary and , since these modes are observed throughout the paramagnetic phase , we suggest to call them _",
    "paraelectromagnons_. indications of similar overdamped excitations were observed earlier in paramagnetic phases of other multiferroics , e.g.  in @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72  @xcite , @xmath73 or @xmath74  @xcite , but their origin and the reason for their activation in the thz spectra were not discussed in the literature yet . based on our experimental results , we believe that the paraelectromagnon frequencies correspond to those of magnons from the bz boundary ; their activation would be a consequence of a relaxation in selection rules in the incommensurately modulated magnetic structure .",
    "further , we assume that the paraelectromagnons exist far above @xmath5 due to short - range magnetic correlations and that they are excited by the electric component of the electromagnetic radiation due to magnetostriction , in the same way as zone - boundary electromagnons below @xmath75.@xcite    the idea of short - range magnetic ordering at temperatures far from the magnetic phase is further supported by our results of the qens .",
    "[ fig : qns - q ] shows the temperature dependence of the scattering intensity @xmath59 integrated over the energy interval @xmath76mev as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath60 . within the whole temperature range ( 10 to 590k ) , a contribution due to coherent qens was observed with an intensity substantially exceeding the noise floor .",
    "remarkably , upon heating above @xmath5 , the qens intensity increases up to @xmath58 where it reaches the maximum . on further heating , a decrease is observed , but the qens intensity remains high and approximately constant even in the metallic cubic phase , up to 590k .",
    "it is worth noting that our observation of presumed electromagnons differs from those reported in single - crystal multiferroics , where a step - like increase in the permittivity often occurs below the temperature where the electromagnon activates .",
    "@xcite in contrast , for our polycrystalline sample of @xmath39 , upon cooling , the permittivity decreases substantially down to 40k due to a drop in conductivity ( above 100k , the loss tangent exceeds unity ) ; we suppose that this compensates the expected increase in the real part of the permittivity upon electromagnon activation .",
    "nevertheless , we observed a small peak in @xmath77 at @xmath29 , followed by an increase below 40k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eps - b ] ) .",
    "one can also observe a decrease in permittivity with magnetic field , which can be explained by stiffening of the electromagnons .",
    "we have performed a thorough spectroscopic study of polycrystalline multiferroic @xmath10 over a wide range of temperatures and applied magnetic fields .",
    "our analysis of the ftir , thz time - domain and ins spectra proves the existence of magnon modes , including probably one electromagnon at 6mev and one at 10mev . in the paramagnetic phase ,",
    "these modes become heavily damped , largely lose their oscillator strengths and disappear as much as 100200k above @xmath5 .",
    "we propose to call such spin modes paraelectromagnons , by analogy with paramagnons .",
    "although our experimental results do not allow us to draw a precise microscopic picture of these modes , the absence of long - range magnetic ordering in the incommensurate phase lets us conclude that the observed absorption peaks near 6 and 10mev can correspond to dynamical short - range correlations which give rise to a maximum in the magnon dos at the edge of the bz .",
    "these peaks , together with the unusually strong qens present up to high temperatures , are apparently linked to the underlying structure and to strong short - range spin - spin interactions , which are also at the origin of the record ferroelectric polarization in @xmath10 .    even if our experiments show that the magnetoelectric character of the excitations seen below 10mev",
    "is highly probable , its final confirmation could be obtained only by measurements of directional dichroism or by a detailed polarization analysis of the thz spectra .",
