    "the study of brown dwarfs ( bds ) in star forming regions has a special importance as it not only allows the formation and evolution of bds to be investigated but also addresses whether the low mass paradigm for star formation can be extended into the substellar regime .",
    "much of what is known about low mass star formation , and in particular the connection between magnetospheric accretion and outflow activity , comes from studying the classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) @xcite .",
    "observational studies point to strong similarities between the evolution of young bds and cttss .",
    "to summarise bds are now known to have disks @xcite , to exhibit t tauri - like accretion activity and variability @xcite and to drive outflows . to date two",
    "bd optical outflows @xcite and a two molecular outflows @xcite have been reported .",
    "further investigation is needed in order to properly compare bd outflows to protostellar outflows .",
    "ls - rcra 1  has a spectral type of m6.5 and an estimated mass of 35 - 72 m@xmath1   placing it within the bd mass range @xcite .",
    "the 10@xmath2 width of the h@xmath0  line is commonly used as a test of accretion activity in bds .",
    "bds with 10@xmath2 width greater than 200 kms@xmath3  ( and equivalent width @xmath4 10 ) are classified as accretors and below as non - accretors @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0  10@xmath2 width and equivalent width ( ew ) clearly demonstrate that ls - rcra 1  is an intense accretor @xcite .",
    "analysis of the spectra discussed here place the h@xmath0  10 @xmath2 width between 270kms@xmath3and 300kms@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite give the ew as varying between 44   and 125  .",
    "forbidden emission lines ( fels ) have proved to be effective tracers of outflow activity in cttss and to date they have been used to explore the kinematics , morphology and physical conditions of jets , at high angular resolution @xcite .",
    "the so - called traditional tracers of ctt jets , i.e. [ oi]@xmath56300,6363 , [ sii]@xmath56716,6731 , [ nii]@xmath66583  are found in the spectra of young bds .",
    "this finding was the first indication that bds commonly launch outflows .",
    "in addition to being an intense accretor ls - rcra 1  was the first bd shown to have fels and notably it has the strongest forbidden emission of any bd studied to date @xcite .",
    "a further interesting feature of ls - rcra 1  is its sub - luminous nature . @xcite",
    "first identified this object and noted that its luminosity is far less than other objects of similar spectral type .",
    "ls - rcra 1  is a strong accretor and current evolutionary models do not take accretion activity into account .",
    "@xcite argue that this could lead to an over - estimation of the age of ls - rcra 1 , thus explaining the lack of agreement between its spectral type and luminosity .",
    "also refer to @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that ls - rcra 1  could have a near edge - on disk , leading to its photosphere being predominantly seen in scattered light @xcite . as a consequence it would appear fainter ( and older ) than it really is .    in this letter",
    "the results of a spectro - astrometric analysis of key lines in the spectrum of ls - rcra 1 are discussed .",
    "spectro - astrometry has been used previously to find outflows driven by the bds iso - oph 102 @xcite and 2mass1207 - 3932 @xcite .",
    "the molecular component to the iso - oph 102 outflow has recently been detected @xcite .",
    "although ls - rcra 1  has strong forbidden lines no spatial extension in the line regions has been directly observed @xcite . here",
    "the displacement of the forbidden emission and h@xmath0  line wings from the bd position is mapped , confirming their origin in an outflow driven by ls - rcra 1 .",
    "results contribute to the debate over the cause of the sub - luminous nature of ls - rcra 1  and increase the number of confirmed bd optical outflows to three .",
    "the high resolution ( r=57,000 ) spectra presented here were obtained with the uv - visual echelle spectrometer ( uves ) ( dekker et al . 2000 ) on the eso vlt ut2 and first published by @xcite . for the purpose of spectro - astrometric analysis",
    "the raw data were obtained from the eso archive .",
    "observations of ls - rcra 1  were taken over a range of dates between june 3@xmath7 2003 and july 4@xmath8 2003 and at a range of slit position angles ( p.as ) . as reported by @xcite",
    "the range of p.a.s resulted from the setting of the parallactic angle so as to minimize losses due to atmospheric differential refraction ( refer to table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the seeing over all nights varied between 09 and 17 and the spatial sampling was 0182 per pixel .",
    "the data were analysed using spectro - astrometry as outlined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spectro - astrometry was first applied to the optical / near - infrared spectra of herbig ae / be and cttss @xcite .",
    "application of the technique to the study of low and intermediate mass stars is relatively straight - forward as both the continuum and line emission is strong .",
    "however , in the case of bds the continuum emission in the range 6000 - 7000   is inherently faint and the fels are far weaker than those excited in ctt jets . in order to increase the signal to noise ( s / n ) of the bd spectra and thus the spectro - astrometric accuracy , the spectra are summed or smoothed ( in the dispersion direction ) before the transverse spatial profiles are fitted @xcite . also as explained in @xcite and @xcite the continuum",
    "is fitted and then removed before the offset in the line region is measured . in our study of bds",
    "we sum / smooth the non - continuum subtracted and subtracted spectra separately so that the accuracy to which we measure the position of the line and continuum emission is comparable . the method chosen to increase the s / n does not effect the overall results . in figures 1 and 2 each point",
    "is the centroid of a spatial profile extracted at a particular velocity and each extracted profile is the sum of a number of adjacent profiles .",
    "hence offsets are a moving sum across the continuum and continuum subtracted line region .    in the case of ls - rcra 1 , while a high s / n was achieved for the forbidden emission and h@xmath0  lines the continuum emission was relatively very faint ( recall that ls - rcra 1  is described as sub - luminous ) . indeed , as reported in @xcite , spectra of ls - rcra 1  obtained using the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) on the magellan ii telescope",
    "were found to be unsuitable for spectro - astrometric analysis , simply due to the non - detection of the continuum emission .",
    "even with the better s / n uves spectra obtained by @xcite and increasing the s / n ( as described above ) , it was still only possible to recover the continuum position in the region of the h@xmath0 , [ sii]@xmath56716,6731  and [ nii]@xmath66583 lines but not at bluer wavelengths .    also note that as in previous investigations of bd outflows with uves , spectro - astrometric artifacts @xcite were not found to be a problem . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite artifacts were ruled out through the demonstration that lines like hei @xmath66678 were not offset .",
    "if measured offsets were indeed artifacts then displacements would be found in all lines , even those which are chromospheric in origin . in this study spectra",
    "are analysed at several pas and overall measured offsets in the lines are on a scale of 50 - 200 mas indicating the presence of spatially extended emission originating in an outflow .",
    "offsets vary with position angle as expected , providing confirmation that they are real .",
    ".spatial offsets measured in the blue - shifted [ nii]@xmath66583  and [ sii]@xmath66731  lines and the blue / red h@xmath0  line wings at slit pas between 45@xmath9 and -73@xmath9 .",

    "in addition , the spectro - astrometric analysis at 45@xmath9 is presented in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "offsets are with respect to the continuum positon with positive offsets to the north and negative to the south .",
    "@xcite give the average velocities of the ls - rcra 1  fels at @xmath10 -5 kms@xmath3 , @xmath10 -22 kms@xmath3  and @xmath10 -13 kms@xmath3  for the [ oi]@xmath66300 , [ nii]@xmath66583 and [ sii]@xmath66731 lines respectively .",

    "it is clear that the pa of 45@xmath9 lies closest to the actual pa of the ls - rcra 1  outflow as offsets are maximised at this slit position .",
    "the change in displacement with pa allows the pa of the outflow to be constrained .",
    "as the slit is moved from 45@xmath9 to 82@xmath9 displacement decreases from @xmath10 145 mas to 45 mas in the fels and @xmath10 50 mas to 10 mas in h@xmath0 . from this the offset one would expect to measure at p.as of 90@xmath9 and 0@xmath9 is calculated .",
    "these two values place the outflow pa at @xmath10 15@xmath9 .    note",
    "that while only the blue - shifted outflow is traced by the fels both the blue and red - shifted lobes are traced by h@xmath0 .",
    "a similar trend has been seen for some cttss and it is hypothesised that while the circumstellar disk obscures the red - shifted forbidden emission , the permitted emission ( which originates much closer to the star due to its significantly higher critical density ) is visible through a hole or gap in the disk @xcite .",
    "we estimate that a minimum ( projected ) disk radius of 015 ( @xmath11 22.5 au at the distance of the coronae australis star forming region ) is needed in order to hide the redshifted component to the ls - rcra 1  forbidden emission .",
    "the formation of disk gaps in cttss is believed to result from grain growth in the inner disk or clearing due to an orbiting planetesimal @xcite . for cttss and young bds grain growth",
    "is probably the most likely explanation and signals the onset of planet formation @xcite .",
    "previous studies have argued for the occurrence of planet forming processes in bd disks @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a dust gap in the disk of ls - rcra 1 , large enough for the red - shifted outflow to be detected , supports the hypothesis that bd disks could at some stage harbour planets .",
    "spectro - astrometric studies of cttss and herbig ae / be stars with disk dust holes have allowed the radii of the holes to be estimated @xcite .",
    "the measured red - shifted offset is taken as an estimate of the radius of the dust hole . in all cases estimates of hole radius from spectro - astrometry",
    "were compared with estimates made from the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the stars .",
    "the seds of stars with circumstellar disks show an excess of emission above the stellar emission ( originating from the disk ) .",
    "stars with inner disk holes , have dips in this excess emission , corresponding to the distance from the star that the region free from dust extends to",
    ". both methods of measuring the radii of the dust holes have yielded similar results @xcite . for ls - rcra 1  a red - shifted offset of 45 mas",
    "@xmath12 14 mas at 45@xmath9 indicates a gap of @xmath10 6.75 @xmath12 2 au in radius .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the gap observed by @xcite in the bd l316 ( this estimate was made from the sed of the bd ) .",
    "analysis of the sed of ls - rcra 1  and of spectra taken at the outflow pa is needed in order to constrain the size of its inner dust hole .",
    "@xcite argue that ls - rcra 1  has an edge - on disk , explaining its faintness compared to other objects of the same spectral type .",
    "for an outflow source with an edge - on disk and thus an outflow in the plane of the sky one would expect to see both lobes of the outflow and to measure low radial velocities for any lines tracing the outflow .",
    "the high and low velocity components ( hvc , lvc ) to fels , commonly detected in the spectra of cttss @xcite , appear blended for high jet inclination angles .",
    "a good example is the outflow driven by the bd 2mass1207 - 3932 .",
    "this bd is known to have a near edge - on disk and the analysis of its outflow supported this .",
    "@xcite detected blue and red - shifted [ oi]@xmath66300 emission at velocites of + 8kms@xmath3  and -4 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the lack of red - shifted forbidden emission means that ls - rcra 1  does not have an edge - on disk but that the disk is sufficiently inclined to obscure the red lobe .",
    "there is also some evidence of separation between the low and high velocity forbidden emission .",
    "the differing origins of the lvc and hvc is well documented for cttss and results in [ nii]@xmath66583 only tracing the hvc ( well collimated high velocity jet ) and both [ sii]@xmath66731 and [ oi]@xmath66300  tracing both the lvc ( less collimated low velocity wind ) and hvc @xcite . although [ oi]@xmath66300  due to its much higher critical density is the better tracer of high density regions close to the star and hence the lvc .",
    "the average radial velocities listed above for the [ oi]@xmath66300 , [ nii]@xmath66583 and [ sii]@xmath66731 lines demonstrate that the [ oi]@xmath66300  line primarily traces the lvc ( -5 kms@xmath3 ) , the [ nii]@xmath66583 line the hvc only ( -22 kms@xmath3  and wing extended to -75kms@xmath3 ) and the [ sii]@xmath66731  line the lvc and hvc ( peak at -13 kms@xmath3  and wing extended to -40 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is supported by the spectro - astrometric analysis of the [ sii]@xmath66731  and [ nii]@xmath66583 lines at @xmath10 45@xmath9 .",
    "the maximum offset in the [ nii]@xmath66583 line occurs at the peak velocity of @xmath10 -22 kms@xmath3 , however , for the [ sii]@xmath66731 the maximum offset is in the wing .",
    "this points to the fact that the [ sii ] emission making up the wing originates in the high velocity component of the outflow , while the bulk of the emission traces a slower less extended component .",
    "the ls - rcra 1  fels are reminiscent of the fels lines found in the spectrum of the ctts dg tau .",
    "the dg tau [ oi]@xmath66300  and [ sii]@xmath66731  lines have a low velocity primary peak and a high velocity secondary peak with maximum offsets occurring in the high velocity peaks .",
    "the [ oi]@xmath66300  line peaks occur at @xmath10 -47 kms@xmath3  and -266 kms@xmath3  and the [ sii]@xmath66731  line peaks at @xmath10 -47 kms@xmath3  and -240 kms@xmath3 . the [ nii]@xmath66583  line is single peaked and maximum offsets occur at the peak velocity of -240 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the spectro - astrometric analysis of the dg tau [ oi]@xmath66300  and [ sii]@xmath66731  lines is published in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the [ nii]@xmath66583  was not published but values quoted here come from the same data .",
    "overall the kinematical and spectro - astrometric results do not support the argument that ls - rcra 1  has an edge - on disk . as a result",
    "the questions related to the luminosity of this source persist .",
    "the fact that it is a strong accretor is now the most likely explanation of the lack of agreement between its spectral type and luminosity .",
    "finally , the spectro - astrometric analysis of the h@xmath0  line shall be discussed in the context of the use of h@xmath0  line widths as a measure of mass accretion in bds .",
    "in addition to being used as a diagnositc of on - going accretion , model fitting of the h@xmath0  line is used to estimate the rate of mass accretion @xcite .",
    "the detection of a significant outflow component to the ls - rcra 1  h@xmath0  line cautions against the use of h@xmath0  alone as a measure of mass accretion rates .",
    "other methods of estimating the mass accretion rate are based on measurements of veiling and of the flux of the caii@xmath68662 line @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to rule out any significant contribution to the h@xmath0  line from a jet / outflow before using it as a reliable probe of magnetospheric accretion .",
    "ls - rcra 1  was the first young bd found to exhibit signatures of outflow activity in the form of fels , similar to those known to trace classical t tauri jets . although the [ oi]@xmath56300,6363 , [ sii]@xmath56716,6731  and [ nii]@xmath66583 lines are strong , spectro - scopic and imaging studies failed to find any extension in these line regions in the form of an outflow @xcite .",
    "furthermore ls - rcra 1 which is noted to be faint in comparison to other sources of the same spectral type , was shown to be a remarkably strong accretor .",
    "several papers have attempted to reconcile the strong outflow and infall signatures with the sub - luminous nature of this object and have offered an edge - on disk scenario as the most likely explanation .    the spectro - astrometric analysis presented here greatly adds to our understanding of this exemplar object as follows .",
    "firstly , a spatial offset in the [ sii]@xmath66731  and [ nii]@xmath66583 fel regions , from the continuum , is seen , verifying their excitation in a blue - shifted outflow and constraining the p.a . of the outflow at @xmath10 15@xmath9 .",
    "the velocities and offsets measured in the lines at a p.a . of 45@xmath9 ( closest to the outflow p.a . ) show the lines to be tracing different components of the overall outflow .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath66583 is clearly tracing the higher velocity component ( associated with a jet in cttss ) while the [ sii]@xmath66731  line is a mixture of high and low velocity emission and the maximum offsets occur in the blue - shifted line wing .",
    "the complete lack of red - shifted forbidden emission along with some evidence of separation between low and high velocity emission means that ls - rcra 1  can not have an edge - on disk .",
    "secondly it is demonstrated for the first time that h@xmath0  can trace outflows driven by bds and that the contribution to the line can be significant .",
    "this discovery is of consequence as h@xmath0  line widths are frequently used as an indicator of accretion activity ( 10@xmath2 width ) and a measure of mass accretion rate in bds .",
    "any study using h@xmath0  to probe mass accretion must consider the possibility of a significant outflow component to the line .",
    "spectro - astrometry is the best tool to use to disentangle the outflow component to any permitted emission line .",
    "finally evidence of a size - able dust - hole in the disk of ls - rcra 1  exists supporting the hypothesis that bd disks could possibly harbour planets .",
    "overall , results support the continuation of key processes in the formation and evolution of low mass stars into the substellar regime .",
    "again it is clear that outflows accompany the formation of bds and that they are analogous but scaled - down from t tauri outflows .",
    "the established tracers of ctt jets , the optical fels , probe bd outflows in an equivalent way and can , as demonstrated here , have low and high velocity components .",
    "in addition , the processes leading to the formation of debris disks also appear to occur in the disks of bds .",
