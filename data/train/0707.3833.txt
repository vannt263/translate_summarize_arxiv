    "ki is a fringe - tracking long baseline near - ir michelson interferometer that combines the light from the two 10-m keck apertures over an 85-m baseline @xcite . for each target , we measured squared visibilities ( @xmath6 ) at @xmath7-band ( @xmath8 @xmath0 m , @xmath9 @xmath0 m ) . the system visibility ( i.e. , the point source response of the interferometer ) was measured using observations of unresolved calibrators ( table [ tab : sample ] ) , weighted by the internal scatter in the calibrator and the temporal and angular proximity to the target source @xcite .",
    "source and calibrator data were corrected for detection biases as described by @xcite and averaged into 5s blocks .",

    "short exposures were read out as `` clearing exposures '' before the longer exposures ( this is the nominal process of double - correlated reads in infrared imaging ) .",
    "the short exposures provide unsaturated images of our targets , while the longer exposures yield high signal - to - noise images of fainter stars within the observed fields that are used for photometric calibration .",
    "the camera provides @xmath21 pixels over a @xmath22 field of view .",
    "images are obtained simultaneously in @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 as part of the camera design .",
    "our data reduction consisted of background ( sky+dark ) subtraction ( using dithered images to produce backgrounds ) and flat fielding .",
    "counts for target and calibrator objects were measured in apertures with 2-pixel radii , sky background was measured as the median value of pixels in an annulus spanning 10 to 20 pixels in radius , and the sky was subtracted from each pixel in the aperture .",
    "we calibrated the fluxes using measured 2mass magnitudes for other stars within the field of view of each target image .",
    "our photometric errors include scatter in measurements of source and calibrator counts , scatter in the magnitudes computed using different calibrators , and an assumed uncertainty in the 2mass magnitudes of our calibrator stars of 0.017 mag . measured fluxes and uncertainties for our sample are listed in table [ tab : phot ] .    where possible , we selected calibrator stars that did not appear to vary from epoch to epoch ; since no photometric standard stars were observed , our photometry is measured relative to calibrator stars within the observed fields .",
    "we evaluated calibrator variability by comparison of each calibrator to the mean value of all calibrators within an epoch ; as we discovered variable sources , we excluded them from the calculated mean value and iterated .",
    "however , for some fields where only a few stars were visible , no non - variable calibrator stars were found with this procedure ( which may indicate unstable atmospheric or instrumental conditions ) ; for these cases our photometric uncertainties include the apparent variability of the flux calibrators .",
    "the binaries in our sample ( dk tau ab and rw aur ab ) are not resolved with the @xmath21 pixels of the pairitel camera .",
    "thus the photometry for these objects is the composite of both components .",
    "the @xmath7-band brightness ratios for dk tau ab and rw aur a are 3.3 and 4.3 , respectively @xcite , and our photometry is thus dominated by the primary components .",
    "in this section we use the data described in  [ sec : obs ] to constrain the properties of the inner disk regions around our sample objects .",
    "our focus is on spatially resolving the circumstellar emission with our interferometry data .",
    "however , because we require measurements of the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio in order to properly model the circumstellar component of our @xmath6 measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we begin by deriving this ratio from our nirspec data (  [ sec : rk ] ) . in  [ sec : rin ] , we model our spatially resolved interferometric measurements of the circumstellar emission from our targets with a simple geometric model . in  [ sec : mdot ] , we derive accretion luminosities for our targets , to enable an investigation of how the inner disk geometries inferred from our interferometry data correlate with mass accretion rate .",
    "we use the nirspec measurements described in  [ sec : nirspec ] to derive 2 @xmath0 m veilings for our sample .",
    "the veiling is defined as the ratio of the circumstellar excess flux to the stellar flux in the @xmath7-band .",
    "veilings are derived by comparing spectra of our target objects with spectra obtained ( on the same night ) for non - accreting , weak - lined t tauri stars ( wltts ) .",
    "these wltts provide excellent templates , since they have stellar effective temperatures and surface gravities similar to the classical t tauri stars in our sample , but show neither near - ir excess emission nor accretion signatures .",
    "we select several atomic absorption lines for comparison between targets and templates . for a grid of wltt templates",
    ", we perform a @xmath23 minimization between the lines seen in the target star and the same lines in the template stars after registration of the relative radial velocities , rotational broadening , and veiling .",
    "radial velocity registration is accomplished via a cross - correlation of target and template star spectra .",
    "rotational broadening is implemented by convolving the template spectrum with a doppler line profile @xcite .",
    "the template is veiled by adding a continuum excess to the normalized , un - veiled spectrum , and then re - normalizing the sum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath24    for objects observed over multiple epochs , we first fitted @xmath25 and @xmath26 simultaneously for each epoch , then fixed the @xmath27 as the weighted average of values from both epochs ( which were consistent within uncertainties in all cases ) , and then repeated the fits with @xmath26 fixed to this average value .",
    "most of the fitted @xmath26 values are smaller than the velocity resolution of our observations , @xmath28 km s@xmath29 .",
    "this means that the @xmath26 values of these targets are compatible with those of the wltt templates .",
    "since the wltts used as templates in our veiling determinations may not be slow rotators , their spectra may already be rotationally broadened . inferred values of @xmath26 for our targets thus",
    "represent only the amount by which the template spectra need to be further broadened , rather than the true @xmath26 of the source , and are only lower limits on the true @xmath27 of our sample .    for this fitting , we used mg and al lines between 2.10 and 2.12 @xmath0 m .",
    "we restricted the fits to 30   regions around strong lines ( figure [ fig : nirspec ] ) to avoid biasing the fits with noisy continuum regions of the spectra . as a check",
    ", we applied this fitting procedure to lines of ti between 2.22 and 2.24 @xmath0 m , in a different spectral order than the mg and al lines ; the fitted veilings in both spectral orders agree within @xmath30 uncertainties .",
    "when we fitted veiling to any of our wltt templates , using the set of remaining wltts as templates for the fitting , we found veilings consistent with zero for all objects but one .",
    "for tyc 5882 , the template with the earliest spectral type , the fitted veiling is @xmath31 ; this is probably due to the mismatch between the spectral type of this and other templates ( see table [ tab : sample ] ) , and does not indicate that tyc 5882 is actually veiled",
    ".    there may be some additional uncertainty in the inferred veilings for v1331 cyg and di cep , since these sources have earlier spectral types ( g5 and g8 , respectively ) than any of our templates ( m2k3 ; table 1 ) . to evaluate the effects of this source / template mismatch",
    ", we fitted our veiled , rotationally broadened templates to a non - accreting , @xmath32 myr old g3/5 star ( hip 9141 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we found that the best - fit veiling for this star is @xmath33 , and we thus the veilings inferred for v1331 cyg and di cep may be biased by this amount .",
    "we conservatively treat this bias as an uncertainty , added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainties in the fitted veilings ; this additional uncertainty is included in table [ tab : veilings ] .",
    "our veiling measurements fall within @xmath5 month of our ki observations , providing estimates of the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios nearly contemporaneous with our interferometric measurements .",
    "moreover , this near - coincidence allows a comparison of veiling and the size scale of the circumstellar emission at multiple epochs ( although there may be some variability in both quantities over the @xmath5 month timescales separating the spectroscopic and interferometric observations ; see below ) .",
    "unfortunately , no measurement of the @xmath7-band veiling is available contemporaneous with the 2002 ki measurements of @xcite .",
    "these authors estimated a circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio of 0.6 by assuming that optical photometry traced the stellar photosphere , extrapolating the photosphere to @xmath7-band and then comparing the extrapolation to the measured @xmath7-band flux .",
    "since the star may be veiled at optical wavelengths ( due to emission from an accretion shock ) , the true photospheric flux may be lower than assumed , and their estimate of the @xmath7-band veiling is therefore a lower limit .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt the value of 0.6 here , and assume an uncertainty of 20% .",
    "inferred veiling values are listed in table [ tab : veilings ] .",
    "for aa tau and rw aur a , the veiling varies ( at greater than the estimated 1@xmath34 uncertainty level ) from epoch to epoch .",
    "this indicates that the relative fluxes of the stellar and circumstellar components in these systems are changing with time .",
    "we now turn to analysis of our interferometric data . to determine the angular extent of the @xmath7-band emission",
    ", we analyze our ki data in the context of a circularly symmetric uniform ring model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , ring models have been used by previous investigators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our use of this model will facilitate comparisons with previous results .",
    "we first remove the contribution to our measured @xmath6 from the unresolved central star . as described by @xcite ,",
    "decomposing the observed @xmath6 into stellar and circumstellar components requires a measurement of the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio ; the veilings determined in ",
    "[ sec : rk ] provide this ratio for our sample .",
    "contributions from the stellar and circumstellar components add linearly to the measured visibilities , and one can write , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio .",
    "the @xmath37 values for our sample , obtained using the veiling values measured closest in time to the measured @xmath6 , are plotted in figure [ fig : kidata ] .",
    "uncertainties in our inferred circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios lead to uncertainties in @xmath37 in addition to those associated with @xmath38 .",
    "this error is smaller when the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio is large . given inferred veilings and associated uncertainties for our sample , the resulting additional uncertainty is less than a few percent . for the first epoch of data from rw aur",
    "a , adopted from @xcite , the uncertainty is likely to be be larger (  [ sec : rk ] ) .",
    "when decomposing observed @xmath6 values into stellar and circumstellar parts , each epoch of ki observations was matched to the @xmath7-band veiling measurement closest in time . because our interferometric and spectroscopic observations are not exactly simultaneous ( generally , measurements are separated by a @xmath5 month ) , and objects may vary photometrically ( at both optical and near - ir wavelengths ) on this time - scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inferred circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios may not represent the true values at the time of the ki observations .",
    "given this potential variability , we also decomposed our multi - epoch @xmath38 into stellar and circumstellar components by adopting the average value of the veiling over all observed epochs .",
    "the circumstellar components of the visibilities , @xmath37 , were fitted with uniform ring models using a @xmath23 minimization to find the model providing the lowest residuals between predicted and measured @xmath6 . for dk",
    "tau a , b , aa tau , and rw aur a , we fitted the ring model to each epoch of our ki observations .",
    "best - fit radii for these face - on uniform ring models , using both the `` nearest - in - time '' and `` average value '' circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratio determinations , are listed in table [ tab : uds ] .",

    "both approaches to estimating the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios for multi - epoch observations yield sizes consistent within 1@xmath34 uncertainties . in the analysis that follows , we will use the sizes derived with the nearest - in - time veiling measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : kidata ] shows that the @xmath6 for some objects ( aa tau , dk tau a , rw aur a , v1002 sco , and as 206 ) do not decrease with increasing projected baseline length ; these data contrast with the predictions of circularly symmetric disk models .",
    "photometrically determined stellar rotation periods combined with @xmath27 measurements suggest highly inclined geometries for some of these sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath6 versus baseline length in figure [ fig : kidata ] .",
    "however , because we are using a single - baseline interferometer ( with a fixed separation and position angle ) , our data generally lack sufficient position angle coverage to place meaningful constraints on inclination ( even accounting for earth rotation , which helps to fill in the position angle coverage ) .    if we fit our data ( assuming that multiple epochs of data trace a non - variable source ) with an inclined uniform disk model ( see e.g. , *",
    "* ) , we generally can not rule out an inclination of @xmath40 ( within 1-@xmath34 uncertainties uncertainties are computed from projections of the surface with @xmath41 . ] ) .",
    "thus , we can not tell whether the non - monotonic behavior seen in figure [ fig : kidata ] is due to asymmetric source geometries or uncertainties in the measurements . for one source , rw aur a , our data are sufficient to constrain the inclination . assuming the source geometry has not varied over the two epochs of observation ( see  [ sec : var ] for discussion of this assumption )",
    ", the best - fit inclined disk model has an inclination of @xmath42 degrees .",
    "one of our aims in this analysis is to compare inferred inner disk properties with stellar and accretion properties .",
    "accretion luminosity is a particularly interesting property to correlate with our inner disk measurements , since accretion can provide additional heating that modifies the inner disk structure .",

    "we do not need to account for veiling here , since we are ultimately interested in the total line luminosity , which depends on the line ew as well as the continuum level ( i.e. , the correction to the ew due to veiling would be offset by de - veiling the continuum when computing the line flux ) .",

    "for example , viscous energy dissipation in accreting material may provide additional heating , pushing the sublimation radius outward .",
    "the sublimation temperature may also be lower , and hence located at larger stellocentric radii , in these low - mass objects because of systematically lower ambient gas densities ( see table 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "small dust grains , which are hotter than larger grains at a given radius , may also lead to larger dust sublimation radii .",
    "finally , these disks may be truncated by a mechanism other than dust sublimation , such as photoevaporative mass loss or magnetospheric truncation . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we argue that of the possible explanations considered , the most likely is a mechanism other than dust sublimation , namely , magnetospheric truncation .",
    "these various possible explanations make different predictions about the accretion rates of sources with exceptionally large inner disk radii .",
    "we therefore investigate how the discrepancy between measured sizes and predictions of irradiated disk models depends on a proxy of source accretion rate rather than @xmath58 , since @xmath50 is closer to the observed quantities .",
    "conversion to @xmath58 requires additional assumptions about stellar mass and radius , and the inner disk radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : laccs ] plots the difference between measured and predicted size as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "we find that objects whose measured sizes are larger than predicted by models actually have lower ( fractional ) accretion luminosities than other sources .",
    "if accretional heating causes larger inner disk truncation radii , then the low - mass stars in figure [ fig : sizes ] would have systematically higher mass accretion rates than other sources .",
    "however , figure [ fig : laccs ] shows that objects with large inner radii tend to have lower accretion rates .",
    "thus , accretional heating seems an unlikely explanation for the large inner disk sizes .",
    "dust sublimates more easily when ambient pressures are lower .",
    "lower mass accretion rates lead to lower gas densities and pressures , and can therefore yield lower sublimation temperatures .",
    "the fact that larger disk truncation radii tend to occur around sources with lower accretion luminosities ( figure [ fig : laccs ] ) is compatible with the hypothesis that these disks are truncated at lower dust sublimation temperatures .",
    "however , the dust sublimation temperature would need to be @xmath60 k to explain many of the large measured disk sizes .",
    "a silicate dust sublimation temperature of 1000 k requires 8 orders of magnitude lower gas density than a sublimation temperature of 1500 k @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath61 orders of magnitude lower mass accretion rates ( assuming an @xmath62-disk to convert gas density into mass accretion rate ) . such low accretion rates , and large dispersion in accretion rate , are not measured for our sample .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that lower sublimation temperature can explain the large truncation radii of disks around low - mass t tauri stars .",
    "smaller dust grains absorb and emit radiation less efficiently than larger grains , and this loss of efficiency is more severe at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , small grains will achieve higher temperatures than larger grains at a given stellocentric radius .",
    "thus , if a disk is composed of small grains , the dust sublimation radius can be larger than implied by equation [ eq : ddn ] , which assumed gray , and hence large - grained , dust @xcite . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we find that the large inner disk sizes in our sample can be reproduced by puffed up inner disk models composed of grains sized 0.10.5 @xmath0 m . while small - dust - grain models can reproduce these larger observed sizes , it seems unlikely that those objects that would require small dust grains to explain the observations are precisely those with the lowest mass accretion rates .",
    "we now consider alternatives to dust sublimation , where the physical process responsible for truncating the disk might be more efficient at lower mass accretion rates .",
    "one such process is photo - evaporation , where the mass - loss driven by stellar uv radiation can overcome accretion at sufficiently low @xmath58 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass flow can `` switch '' from accretion to outflow when the accretion rate drops below @xmath63 m@xmath2 yr@xmath29 .",
    "since the objects in our sample have accretion rates @xmath64 m@xmath2 yr@xmath29 ( based on the accretion luminosities in table [ tab : ews ] ) , photo - evaporation is unlikely to dominate accretion .",
    "moreover , we do not see the signature of a discrete transition in figure [ fig : laccs ] at a certain accretion luminosity .",
    "thus , photo - evaporation is unlikely to be the physical mechanism behind the truncated disks observed for the low - mass t tauri stars in our sample .",
    "large inner disk radii may also be due to magnetospheric truncation .",
    "stars accrete material via magnetospheric accretion ; the stellar magnetic field threads the disk and essentially creates a barrier to midplane accretion at the point of balance between magnetic pressure and inward pressure from accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetospheric radius is given by @xcite : @xmath65^{1/7 } , \\label{eq : rmag}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the dipole magnetic field strength .",
    "for many classical t tauri stars , high disk accretion rates ( @xmath67 m@xmath2 yr@xmath29 ) confine this magnetospheric radius to well within the dust sublimation radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus the observed inner edge of the dust disk occurs where temperatures reach the sublimation temperature ( i.e. , @xmath552000 k ) .    however , lower accretion rates allow the magnetospheric radius to extend to larger stellocentric radii ( @xmath68 ) , while the lower associated accretion luminosity leads to a smaller stellocentric radius of dust sublimation .",
    "low accretion rates can therefore cause magnetospheric truncation outside of the dust sublimation radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if we take @xmath69 kg , @xmath70 r@xmath2 , and @xmath71 m@xmath2 as typical values for low - mass t tauri stars ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , then mass accretion rates between @xmath72 and @xmath73 m@xmath2 yr@xmath29 ( compatible with the lowest accretion luminosities in table [ tab : ews ] ) yield magnetospheric radii between 0.07 and 0.15 au , comparable to the measured inner disk sizes in figure [ fig : sizes ] .",
    "we thus favor magnetospheric truncation as the explanation for the large inner disk sizes of low - mass t tauri stars .      many young stars , including those in our sample ,",
    "are known to be photometrically variable at optical through near - infrared wavelengths , with variability timescales ranging from days to months ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the underlying cause of the variability is usually attributed to star - spots , which modulate the emission on the stellar rotation period , in some cases inner disk variability may also play a role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time - varying increases in disk accretion rates , which might occur on inner disk dynamical timescales of days to weeks , could lead to increased disk heating and higher near - ir emission .",
    "since a hotter disk could sublimate dust at larger stellocentric radii than a cooler disk , the inner edge of the dust disk may move in and out as the disk heating varies .",
    "conversely , if disks are magnetospherically truncated , then increases in accretion rate would lead to smaller disk sizes ( equation [ eq : rmag ] ) .",
    "variability in the stellar magnetic field strength can also cause variability in mass accretion rates and changes in the inner disk radius over timescales comparable to stellar dynamo oscillation period , typically @xmath74 yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we obtained multiple epochs of spectroscopic and photometric data for dk tau a and b , aa tau , and rw aur a and b , and multiple epochs of interferometric data for all of these except rw aur b. as indicated in tables [ tab : phot][tab : ews ] , several sources have variable infrared fluxes , veilings , and inferred accretion luminosities .",
    "moreover , one object ( rw aur a ) may have a variable inner disk size ( figure [ fig : kidata ] ; table [ tab : uds ] ) .    in the scenario where observed variability is due to changes in the disk heating ( e.g. , because of time - variable disk accretion rates ) , we would expect the following for higher disk temperatures : 1 ) @xmath7-band flux will increase ; 2 ) veiling will increase , since the circumstellar flux is increasing relative to the stellar flux ; 3 ) accretion luminosity may increase ( if this is the source of the disk heating ) ; 4 ) the measured inner disk size should increase , since the dust sublimation radius would move out .",
    "none of our targets clearly show such signatures . for dk",
    "tau a , the @xmath7-band veiling , near - ir fluxes , and inner disk size remain constant ( within uncertainties ) over the span of our multi - epoch observations . for aa tau",
    ", the veiling appears to decrease from one epoch to the next while the br@xmath14 flux also decreases .",
    "however , the inner disk size remains constant ( or marginally increases ; table [ tab : uds ] ) ) and the @xmath20-band flux appears to increase in the latter epoch , contrary to expectations for a dimmer disk .",
    "for , the br@xmath14 luminosity appears to increase as the veiling decreases , which is not consistent with expectations for our scenario of inner disk variability above .",
    "dk tau b and rw aur b show no variability in any of our data .    if the emission from our targets is circularly symmetric , then our modeling indicates potential variability ( above the 1@xmath34 level ) in the inner disk size with time for .",
    "the inner disk radius appears to increase as the @xmath7-band veiling increases , which is expected since a larger inner rim would produce more near - ir emission ( for a fixed temperature ) .",
    "however , figure [ fig : raw ] shows only marginal variability in the measured @xmath6 ( in contrast to the @xmath37 plotted in figure [ fig : kidata ] ) from one epoch to the next , and the apparent inner disk variability rests entirely on the inferred circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios .",
    "the first epoch of ki data for does not have a reliable estimate of this ratio ; the estimate of 0.6 from @xcite is a lower limit (  [ sec : rk ] ) , and a ratio as high as 2.5 would eliminate the apparent variability . furthermore , a highly inclined disk can fit the data for well without any variability in the inner disk size , even if the inferred circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios are taken at face value (  [ sec : rin ] ) .",
    "thus we can not claim to see inner disk variability based on these data .",
    "the interpretation of our multi - epoch observations is complicated by the fact that different data constituting each epoch were not obtained simultaneously .",
    "data for a given epoch were obtained within a few week time - window . because the dynamical timescales for inner disk variability are @xmath75 days for the inner radii inferred for our sample , there may be substantial source variability between the different measurements within a single epoch . in future work , the observations constituting a single epoch should ideally be obtained within @xmath5 day of one another .",
    "in addition , a larger number of epochs would facilitate investigation of inner disk variability .",
    "using near - ir interferometric , spectroscopic , and photometric data , we measured the inner disk radii of 11 low - mass t tauri stars .",
    "in addition , we measured the near - ir veilings and accretion luminosities of these objects .",
    "our data substantiate previous claims that the inner disk radii of t tauri stars are generally consistent with the predictions of disk models with vertically extended inner rims at stellocentric radii where disk temperatures reach dust sublimation temperatures , between 1500 and 2000 k. however , there are a handful of sources , in particular objects with stellar luminosities @xmath76 l@xmath2 , for which the measured radii are substantially larger than predicted by such models .    discrepancies between models where disks are truncated at the dust sublimation radius and measured inner disk radii are larger for sources with low ratios of accretion to stellar luminosity .",
    "thus , the physical mechanism by which the inner disk is truncated appears to depend on the relative importance of stellar irradiation and accretion . to explain this observation",
    ", we suggest that at low accretion rates , as the pressure of accreting material drops , the point of balance between inward accretion pressure and outward stellar magnetic pressure moves to larger stellocentric radii . at sufficiently low accretion rates ,",
    "magnetospheric radii can become larger than the dust sublimation radii , yielding the large observed sizes for low - accretion - rate objects in our sample .    for several of our sample objects",
    ", we obtained multiple epochs of interferometric , spectroscopic , and photometric data , and for each epoch the various datasets were obtained within a few weeks of one another .",
    "we used these multi - epoch observations to search for inner disk variability .",
    "while inferred veilings , accretion luminosities , and even inner disk truncation radii , appear to vary for some sources , none of the objects show a variability signature consistent with changes in the inner disk .",
    "future monitoring observations with more epochs , and with different data comprising each epoch obtained within a time - window short compared to inner disk dynamical timescales , will enable a more rigorous probe of inner disk variability .",

    "<S> we present high angular resolution observations with the keck interferometer , high dispersion spectroscopic observations with keck / nirspec , and near - ir photometric observations from pairitel of a sample of 11 solar - type t tauri stars in 9 systems . </S>",
    "<S> we use these observations to probe the circumstellar material within 1 au of these young stars , measuring the circumstellar - to - stellar flux ratios and angular size scales of the 2.2 @xmath0 m emission . </S>",
    "<S> our sample spans a range of stellar luminosities and mass accretion rates , allowing investigation of potential correlations between inner disk properties and stellar or accretion properties . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the mechanism by which the dusty inner disk is truncated may depend on the accretion rate of the source ; in objects with low accretion rates , the stellar magnetospheres may truncate the disks , while sublimation may truncate dusty disks around sources with higher accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> we have also included in our sample objects that are known to be highly variable ( based on previous photometric and spectroscopic observations ) , and for several sources , we obtained multiple epochs of spectroscopic and interferometric data , supplemented by near - ir photometric monitoring , to search for inner disk variability . </S>",
    "<S> while time - variable veilings and accretion rates are observed in some sources , no strong evidence for inner disk pulsation is found . </S>"
