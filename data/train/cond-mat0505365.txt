    "<S> we report on a promising approach to the artificial modification of ferromagnetic properties in ( ga , mn)as using a ga@xmath0 focused ion beam ( fib ) technique . the ferromagnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as such as magnetic anisotropy and curie temperature can be controlled using ga@xmath0 ion irradiation , originating from a change in hole concentration and the corresponding systematic variation in exchange interaction between mn spins . this change in hole concentration </S>",
    "<S> is also verified using micro - raman spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we envisage that this approach offers a means of modifying the ferromagnetic properties of magnetic semiconductors on the micro- or nano - meter scale .        </S>",
    "<S> extensive studies of the ferromagnetic properties of @xmath1-type mn - doped iii - v semiconductors ( in , mn)as and ( ga , mn)as have been heralding a new era of spin electronics in recent years @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> mn)as is expected to be achieved , given a systematic variation in the carrier concentration in ( ga , mn)as . </S>",
    "<S> ga@xmath2 ion irradiation is one of the most suitable tools for modifying the carrier concentration in gaas on the micro- or nano - meter scale : this technique has been used to control the conductivity of gaas and to fabricate mesoscopic semiconductor structures.@xcite being motivated by the prospect of controlling the carrier concentration in ( ga , mn)as with this approach , we have recently reported a preliminary experiment on the influence of ga@xmath2 ion irradiation on the ferromagnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as using a focused ion beam ( fib ) technique.@xcite however , a systematic variation in the ferromagnetic features of ( ga , mn)as was not obtained , although a sure sign that ga@xmath2 ion irradiation altered the hole carrier concentration and the corresponding magnetic properties was detected .    in this study , we demonstrate for the first time the systematic control of ferromagnetism such as magnetic anisotropy and curie temperature in @xmath1-type ( ga , mn)as by adjusting ga@xmath2 ion irradiation dosage . </S>",
    "<S> this technique can be applied to fabricating geometrically modified magnetic structures on the nanometer scale in a single ( ga , mn)as epilayer .     ion beam . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) schematic diagram of ion irradiation process for sample covered with eb resist as mask.,width=302 ]    a ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as epilayer with a thickness of 75 nm was grown on a gaas / gaas ( 001 ) substrate using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , followed by low - temperature annealing at 245@xmath5c in n@xmath6 gas atmosphere for 240 min.@xcite the epilayer was patterned into 10-@xmath7m - wide bar structures ( 10@xmath8150 @xmath7m@xmath9 ) with ti / au ohmic contacts using electron beam ( eb ) lithography and wet etching for transport measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the long axis of the samples was oriented along gaas [ 100 ] [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were subjected to ion irradiation using a 30 kev ga@xmath2 fib ( fb-2000a , hitachi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ion irradiation conditions were controlled by adjusting the beam current ranging from 4 to 40 pa and the irradiation area region from 10@xmath9 to 10@xmath10 @xmath7m@xmath9 under a constant irradiation time of 12 s ; the irradiation dosage was varied from 4.0 @xmath8 10@xmath11 to 4.0 @xmath8 10@xmath12 ion / cm@xmath9 in the 10 @xmath810 @xmath7m@xmath9 area located in the region between two voltage electrodes [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed using atomic force microscopy that the thickness of an etched layer subjected to the ion irradiation is less than 2 nm . to protect the voltage electrodes from being damaged by ion irradiation , the samples except for the area to be irradiated </S>",
    "<S> were masked with eb resist [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation suggests that ga@xmath2 ions penetrate down to several ten nm underneath the eb resist so no damages occur in ( ga , mn)as covered with eb resist . </S>",
    "<S> transport measurements were performed by means of a standard four - probe method using a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) , and magnetic fields were applied parallel to the long axis of the bar structure ( [ 100 ] ) .     </S>",

    "<S> 2 as a function of ga@xmath2 ion irradiation dosage . the data of nonirradiated as - grown and annealed samples are also shown as references . </S>",
    "<S> both nonirradiated samples show clear metal - insulator transitions near the curie temperature ( @xmath14),@xcite and the annealing decreases their resistance by a factor of 1/30 at 4 k.@xcite we define as @xmath15 the metal - insulator transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is also increased by a factor of 2 by annealing , indicating that annealing leads to an increase in the hole carrier concentration.@xcite the annealed samples were then irradiated with the ga@xmath0 ion beam at various irradiation dosages using an fib technique . with increasing irradiation dosage , @xmath15 shifts toward a lower temperature and resistance increases up to @xmath16m@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the insulating behavior at a low temperature becomes significant with increasing irradiation dosage .        </S>",
    "<S> figures 3 show the field - dependent resistances ( mr curves ) of a nonirradiated annealed sample ( sample a ) and the corresponding irradiated sample ( sample b ) with an ion irradiation dosage of @xmath18 ion/@xmath19 at 4 k. as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , an increase in mr is observed at remanence for sample a as indicated by an arrow ; on the other hand , no visible changes in mr are seen at remanence for sample b. this feature is more clearly seen in an enlargement of the low - field regime from + 250 oe to @xmath2020 oe [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ] : the mr change for sample a is larger than that for sample b. because the magnetoresistance of ( ga , mn)as is generally explained in terms of anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr)@xcite , we can deduce the orientation of magnetization from the mr feature : the magnetization of sample a tilts from [ 100 ] toward [ 110 ] while that of sample b remains along [ 100 ] at remanence . </S>",
    "<S> schematic illustrations of the magnetization direction at remanence are depicted in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) for both samples . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide clear evidence that the contribution of [ 110 ] uniaxial anisotropy for the irradiated sample is smaller than that for the nonirradiated sample .    </S>",
    "<S> in our recent studies,@xcite it has been found that the in - plane magnetic anisotropy of ( ga , mn)as / gaas(001 ) , which is composed of both @xmath21 cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and [ 110 ] uniaxial anisotropy,@xcite strongly depends on hole concentration , and that the contribution of [ 110 ] uniaxial anisotropy is enhanced with increasing hole concentration.@xcite thus , it is likely that irradiated samples , which show a small contribution of [ 110 ] uniaxial anisotropy , have a lower hole concentration than noniraddiated samples.@xcite to obtain clearer information about the mechanism of the change in the transport properties and the magnetic anisotropy shown in figs . 2 and 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the hole concentration of irradiated samples from the @xmath14 vs hole concentration data shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , assuming @xmath14 @xmath22 @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> because the curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy of ( ga , mn)as correlate with hole concentration@xcite , we expect a close relationship between hole concentration and ion irradiation dosage . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows the hole concentration @xmath1 ( left axis ) of irradiated samples as a function of ga@xmath0 ion irradiation dosage . a systematic decrease in hole concentration </S>",
    "<S> is seen with increasing ion irradiation dosage , indicating that curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy can be contolled by adjusting the dosage .     </S>",
    "<S> ( left axis ) and ratio of peak intensities @xmath23 ( right axis ) as a function of ga@xmath2 ion irradiation dosage . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath1 measured by the electrochemical capacitance - voltage ( ecv ) method @xcite for various ( ga , mn)as samples.,width=302 ]    micro - raman data for various irradiated samples with different dosages also corroborate our proposal of the effect of ion irradiation.@xcite detailed procedures of the raman measurements and analyses are described elsewhere.@xcite we note that the raman data exhibit no influence of structural disorder in irradiated samples because the data were collected after removing 25 nm of ( ga , mn)as from the surface using a wet etching technique and the crystal structure of the remaining ( ga , mn)as was confirmed to be the same as that of the nonirradiated samples by high - resolution x - ray diffraction analysis.@xcite an essential feature of the raman spectra is the following : the spectra consist of two peaks which originate from a longitudinal optical ( lo ) mode and a coupled plasmon longitudinal optical mode ( cplom ) overlapped with a transverse optical ( to ) mode.@xcite we plot @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 ( right axis ) as a function of ga@xmath0 ion irradiation dosage in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> a clear irradiation dosage dependence of @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 is observed similar to that of hole concentration , which is consistent with the fact that cplom is associated with carrier concentration . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the changes in @xmath15 ( fig . 2 ) and magnetic anisotropy ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) with ga@xmath0 ion irradiation are due to a reduction in hole concentration.@xcite also , the reduction in hole concentration may be attributed to the formation of deep trap levels , as we proposed in our previous report.@xcite    in summary , we have demonstrated the control of the ferromagnetism of ( ga , mn)as using ga@xmath0 fib . </S>",
    "<S> curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy can be controlled by adjusting ga@xmath0 ion dosage as seen from magnetoresistance and micro - raman data , which we attribute to a change in hole concentration due to the formation of deep trap levels . because the fib technique has an advantage of focusing a beam on the nanometer scale , </S>",
    "<S> we expect it to be utilized as a nanoscale modification tool for determining the magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as with the prospect of developing novel spin electronic devices . </S>"
