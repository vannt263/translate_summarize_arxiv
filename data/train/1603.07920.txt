    "cross - checking the host galaxy morphologies shown in figure  [ figsdssa ] , [ figsdssb ] against the line - to - luminosity ratios , we do not see any definitive correlation .",

    " outlier \" in the @xmath863\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$]/@xmath5-@xmath5  relation ( figure [ figlineratio ] ) .",
    "the [ oi ]  broad velocity component does not have corresponding broad [ cii ]  component , detectable in our spectra . in figure",

    ". please note that we do not split the ir flux since it is hard to do it in a fair way .",
    "compared with the model grid , the narrow velocity component for w0752 + 19 has very similar properties as that of the rest of the sample with @xmath241@xmath6@xmath280 @xmath17 and @xmath249@xmath6@xmath281 .",
    "however , the ism of the broad velocity component has density of @xmath282 @xmath17 , much denser than any of local ulirgs and normal galaxies , but reaching similar values observed among a few starburst galaxies at @xmath1@xmath151 .    in figure [ figpdrmodel ]",
    "we also use solid arrows to indicate the locations ( _ i.e. _ the arrow head ) of our qsos when the correction factor of 1.4 is not applied to the [ cii ]  flux .",
    "a source will move along both axes by 0.15 dex when the [ cii ]  emission dominates the cooling , and thus the estimated @xmath241 and @xmath249 will lower by @xmath283 dex .",
    "it is important to note that in the regimes with very low or high @xmath241 values , small changes in line flux ratios could imply significant changes in the inferred density values from comparisons with models , as shown in figure  [ figpdrmodel ] .",
    "however , one should be cautious because pdr models may not be very reliable in these regimes .",
    "considering these @xmath241 and @xmath249 values are rough estimates , we believe that applying the correction factor of 1.4 to the [ cii ]  flux or not will not affect the main science conclusions in this paper .",
    "the fir fine structure lines [ oi]63@xmath4 m  and [ cii ]  are thought to be excited by collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen in pdrs , where the gas are heated by the photo - electric effect , i.e. , hot electrons are ejected from pah molecules and small dust grains by absorbing fuv photos , and transfer their energy to the gas .",
    "[ oi]@xmath626300,6364  and [ oi]63@xmath4 m  emissions can also be produced or boosted by shocks ( hollenbach & mckee 1989 ; allen et al .",
    "2008 ; lesaffre et al .",
    "2013 ) in the outflows / winds observed frequently in both nearby and distant qsos ( greene et al .",
    "2011 ; sturm et al . 2011 ; nesvadba et al . 2011 ; cano - daz et al .",
    "2012 ; harrison et al .",
    "2012 ) .    specifically for the objects in our sample ,",
    "the question is whether any observed fir fine - structure emission could have different heating sources , particular the ones with broad velocity components .",
    "could the dissipation of kinematic energy released through a cascade of turbulent motions from large to small scales be a significant heating source ?    to this end , we compared the observed [ oi]@xmath866300/h@xmath92  ratios for the narrow component ( i.e. @xmath284 ) to the radiative shock models presented in allen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , as shown in figure  [ figbpt ] .",
    "we have chosen the model grids which have twice solar abundance and pre - shock density of @xmath285 @xmath17 , as discussed in allen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , because the photoionization models with this metallicity can well reproduce the observed narrow - line ratios in agns ( groves et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ) , and that agns are typically hosted in galaxies more massive than 10@xmath286 @xmath287 and hence are likely to contain high - metallicity gas ( e.g. , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) . from figure [ figbpt ] we can see that shock models fall much too short to match the observed [ oi]@xmath626300,6364  ratios and the optical [ oi]@xmath626300,6364",
    "emissions are likely powered by fuv photons from agns rather than shocks .",
    "in addition , observations and shock model calculations ( burton et al . 1990",
    "; appleton et al . 2013 ; lesaffre et al .",
    "2013 ) have shown that [ oi]/fir and [ cii]/fir ratios for shocked gas tend to be elevated , about an order of magnitude higher than those produced by photoelectric heating in pdrs .",
    "as shown in  3.3 , the observed [ oi]/fir ( [ cii]/fir ) ratios for our qsos do not show any significant enhancement comparing to normal / starburst / agn galaxies , which further confirms that the gas emissions , both in the optical and fir , should be heated by agns and/or starburst activities of the host galaxies .",
    "the basic result from our study is the detections of strong [ oi]63@xmath4 m  and [ cii ]  line emission from @xmath1@xmath60.15 ir bright qsos . using the far - ir line - to - luminosity ratios and the standard pdr models , we infer the densities of the warm neutral gas clouds responsible for the observed line emission are in the range of @xmath288@xmath17 , with one exceptional case of w0752 + 19 , whose broad [ oi]63@xmath4 m  component implies a density @xmath282@xmath17 .",
    "sources with far - ir [ oi]63@xmath4 m  line widths as broad as 720km / s are rare . in the sample of local ulirgs ,",
    "farrah et al . (",
    "2013 ) have found that about 30%  have broad components with velocity widths of @xmath6500kms@xmath26 , none reached the level of 700km / s .",
    "so where does this broad velocity component in w0752 + 19 come from ? there are three possibilities .",
    "the first is narrow line region ( nlr ) with a size of a few hundred parsecs , photo - ionized by radiation field of an accreting supermassive blackhole .",
    "the other two possibilities are star forming regions ( pdrs ) in the host galaxy and dense gas outflows .    in the standard agn / qso model ,",
    "the forbidden emission lines are collisionally excited and believed to come from nlrs with densities of @xmath289@xmath17 ( see a review by osterbrock 1991 ) .",
    "most of our far - ir [ oi ]  and [ cii ]  detections indicate smaller densities , which suggest these narrow lines maybe mostly come from the pdrs in the host galaxies . with the same density argument",
    ", it would be consistent if the broad [ oi]63@xmath4 m  component in w0752 + 19 comes from the warm and dense ism within the nlr .",
    "in addition , we find that the line centroids of broad far - ir [ oi ]  and broad optical [ oi]@xmath866300  are coinciding , with the negligible offset of 63kms@xmath26 .",
    "this lends an additional support to the nlr origin for the broad [ oi]63@xmath4 m  emission in w0752 + 19 .",
    "however , we note that the densities derived here are based on pdr models , which could be significantly different from those derived from a nlr model / geometry . therefore , we can not totally rule out the nlr origin of these fir fine - structure lines .",
    "gas outflows could be an alternative explanation since outflows are frequently observed in qsos ( e.g fischer et al .",
    "2010 ; aalto et al . 2012 ; cicone et al . 2014",
    "; tadhunter et al .",
    "the broad and asymmetric ( e.g extended blue wing ) line profile seems to support this interpretation .",
    "the none - detection of the broad [ cii ]  emission line in w0752 + 19 means that the gas density of this outflow gas is quite high , @xmath290@xmath17 ( see  3.3.2 ) . at these high density regimes , [ cii ]",
    "emission is suppressed due to collisional de - excitation .",
    "such dense gas outflow is rare , and has been reported in mrk231 ( aalto et al .",
    "however , one potential difficulty in the outflow scenario is that we do not detect optical [ oi]@xmath866300  emission with a velocity width similar to the broad [ oi]63@xmath4 m  component in w0752 + 19 .",
    "there is another indirect and crude way to investigate the physical regime where the fir [ oi ]  ( [ cii ] ) emission may arise , _",
    "i.e. _ to compare the dynamical mass estimates of the dense neutral gas ( @xmath291 ) for our sample with those having high spatial resolution observations , such as the high-@xmath1 qsos in wang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , in which the [ cii ]  emissions were marginally resolved .",
    "our qsos have similar blackhole masses ( @xmath292 ) as those in wang et al .",
    "this comparison may shed some light on the properties of neutral ism in low and high-@xmath1 qsos .",
    "many studies of agns / qsos have proposed that nlrs could contain multi - components  an inner biconical nlrs over a size of a few 100pc , and a much larger extended narrow line region ( enlr ) , which are gravity - dominated and could have organized velocity structures , such as outflows and rotations ( osterbrock 1991 ; veilleux 1991 ) . for a rotating gas disk with a radius @xmath293",
    ", the dynamical mass can be calculated as @xmath291=@xmath294 , where @xmath295 is the maximum circular velocity and @xmath296 the gravitational constant . because almost all of the detected [ oi]63@xmath4 m  and [ cii ]  lines are resolved , as shown in table  [ tableline ] , it is possible for us to construct a toy model , where we assume the neutral gas producing far - ir [ oi ]  and [ cii ]  emission is in a rotating disk with a radius of the size of enlr , and we also approximate @xmath295@xmath6@xmath297(line)/@xmath298 , with @xmath91 as the disk orientation angle .",
    "we chose the larger value of the [ oi]63@xmath4 m  and [ cii ]  line widths for @xmath295 .",
    "the enlr sizes can be estimated using the empirical @xmath299-size relations , @xmath300 ) = 0.46\\log(l_{5100\\mathring{\\mathrm{a } } } { \\rm [ erg s^{-1 } ] } ) -16.95 $ ] ( bentz et al . 2009 ; husemann et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the @xmath299 and black hole mass measurements are taken from shen et al .",
    "the resulting enlr radii are @xmath301kpc , which are comparable to sizes of host galaxies",
    ". this toy model yields dynamical masses @xmath302 of @xmath303@xmath304 .",
    "is this toy model consistent with the gas densities derived from the [ oi]63@xmath4m/[cii ]  ratios ? as we showed before ,",
    "the gas densities are mostly in the range of @xmath305@xmath17 .",
    "if we take the gas density of @xmath306@xmath17 , the disk scale height @xmath307 of 200pc , the gas disk with the radii of enlrs , and the volume filling factor of 0.1 , we obtain the total gas masses @xmath308 , with @xmath309 as mean atomic weight for neutral gas .",
    "these numbers are somewhat smaller , but consistent with the dynamical estimates .",
    "how are our dynamical mass estimates compared with the measurements for high-@xmath1 qsos ?",
    "wang et al . ( 2013 ) recently published a sample of @xmath1@xmath65 qsos with the alma [ cii ]  maps which spatially resolved [ cii ]  emitting gas , yielding the sizes of @xmath310kpc .",
    "their derived @xmath311 are in the range of 1.6 - 15@xmath304 using the same definition of @xmath295 as ours .",
    "this is similar to the dynamical gas masses derived for our qsos . at the face value",
    ", this similarity implies that the masses of dense neutral ism are not changing significantly in qsos at @xmath1@xmath312 and @xmath1@xmath313 .",
    "this inference seems to be in contradiction with other published ism studies , suggesting that high-@xmath1 sources have higher gas fractions relative to their stellar masses ( tacconi et al .",
    "2013 ; genzel et al .",
    "this contradiction implies that our assumption of radii @xmath293 in our calculation may be too large , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sizes of the far - ir line emitting regions in low-@xmath1 qsos are likely smaller than that of enlrs , @xmath301kpc .",

    "we present _ herschel _  pacs spectroscopic observations of a sample of nine qsos , selected to be at @xmath1@xmath60.1 - 0.2 from _ sdss _ spectra and have 22@xmath4 m  fluxes greater than 1mjy .",
    "the full ir sed fitting reveals that our qsos are mostly starburst and agn composite systems , with @xmath5  around several times @xmath7 , a factor of a few less than that of local ulirgs and over an order of magnitude less luminous than that of @xmath1@xmath151 qsos with available fir spectroscopy .",

    "our observations also suggest that the agn dominated systems in our sample seem to have higher [ oi]63@xmath4m / fir ratios , which can be explained by the hotter seds produced by agns , and by the lower @xmath5/@xmath23  ratios in these systems .    assuming the [ oi]63@xmath4 m  and [ cii ]  lines arise mainly in pdrs",

    "<S> we present a study of interstellar medium in the host galaxies of 9 qsos at 0.1@xmath0@xmath1@xmath00.2 with blackhole masses of @xmath2 to @xmath3 based on the far - ir spectroscopy taken with _ </S>",

    "<S> our qso sample has far - infrared luminosities ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6several times @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed line - to-@xmath5  ratios ( @xmath863\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$]/@xmath5  and @xmath9}$]/@xmath5 ) are in the ranges of 2.6@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 and 2.8@xmath10@xmath11@xmath122@xmath10@xmath14 respectively ( including upper limits ) . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are comparable to the values found in local ulirgs , but higher than the average value published so far for @xmath1@xmath151 ir bright qsos . </S>",
    "<S> one target , w0752 + 19 , shows an additional broad velocity component ( @xmath6720km / s ) , and exceptionally strong [ oi]63@xmath4 m emission with @xmath863\\,\\mu{\\rm m}}$]/@xmath5  of @xmath13 , an order of magnitude higher than that of average value found among local ( u)lirgs . combining with the analyses of the _ sdss _ optical spectra , we conclude that the [ oi]63@xmath4 m emission in these qsos is unlikely excited by shocks . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the broad [ oi]63@xmath4 m  emission in w0752 + 19 could arise from the warm and dense ism in the narrow line region of the central agn . </S>",
    "<S> another possible explanation is the existence of a dense gas outflow with @xmath16@xmath17 , where the corresponding broad [ cii ]  emission is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> based on the far - ir [ oi ]  and [ cii ]  line ratios , we estimate the constraints on the ism density and uv radiation field intensity of @xmath18 @xmath17 and @xmath19 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values are consistent with those found in local seyfert 1 ulirgs . </S>",
