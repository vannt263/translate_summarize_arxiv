    "distributed compression of spatially correlated signals , e.g. , the observations of neighboring sensors in high density sensor networks , can drastically reduce the amount of data to be transmitted .",
    "the efficiency of compression , however , largely depends on the accuracy of the estimation of the correlation between the sources .",
    "the correlation is required at the encoder to determine the encoding rate ; it is also required to initialize the decoding algorithm in the slepian - wolf coding schemes that use channel codes with iterative decoding , e.g. , ldpc codes @xcite .",
    "the correlation is unknown at the encoder and is modeled by a  virtual \" channel .",
    "the estimation of the _ virtual correlation channel _ involves modeling it and estimating the model parameter @xcite .",
    "therefore , if this virtual correlation channel is not modeled accurately , even perfect estimation of the model parameter can not guarantee an efficient compression .",
    "the correlation between the two binary sequences @xmath0 and @xmath1 is commonly modeled by using a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) with a crossover probability @xmath2 the parameter @xmath3 is either assumed to be known at the encoder @xcite or needs to be estimated @xcite .",
    "this model is also widely used in the compression of continuous - valued sources where slepian - wolf coding @xcite is employed to compress the sources after quantization .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that the correlation between continuous - valued sources can be modeled more accurately in the continuous domain .",
    "specifically , the gaussian distribution and its variations such as the gaussian bernoulli - gaussian ( gbg ) and the gaussian - erasure ( ge ) distributions are used for this purpose , particularly when evaluating theoretical bounds @xcite .    in this paper , we first show that a ",
    "single \" bsc can not accurately model the correlation between continuous - valued sources , and we propose a new correlation model that exploits  multiple \" bscs for this purpose .",
    "the number of these channels is equal to the number of bits used in the binary representation of one sample .",
    "each channel models the bits with the same significance , i.e. , from the most significant bit ( msb ) to the least significant bit ( lsb ) , which is denoted as a bit - plane @xcite .",
    "we next focus on the implementation of the new model in the ldpc - based compression of continuous - valued sources .",
    "we modify the existing decoding algorithm for this specific model extracted from continuous - valued input sources and investigate its impact on the coding efficiency .",
    "further , by using an interleaver before feeding data into the slepian - wolf encoder , the successive bits belonging to one sample are shuffled to introduce randomness to the errors in the binary domain .",
    "numerical results , both in the binary and continuous domains , demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the existing correlation models are discussed in section [ sec : oldcor ] . in section [ sec : newcor ] we introduce a new correlation model for continuous - valued sources . section [ sec : dec ] is devoted to integration of the new model to the ldpc - based slepian - wolf coding .",
    "simulation results are presented in section [ sec : sim ] .",
    "this is followed by conclusions in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "lossless compression of correlated sources ( slepian - wolf coding ) is performed through the use of channel codes where one source is considered as a noisy version of the other one .",
    "this requires knowing the correlation between the sources at the decoder .      the correlation and virtual communication channel between the binary sequences @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the same @xcite and are usually modeled by a bsc with crossover probability @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter of this channel is defined by .",
    "equivalently , one can obtain @xmath3 by averaging the hamming weight of @xmath6 for a long run of input data and side information , i.e. , @xmath7 then , using binary channel coding , near - lossless compression with a vanishing probability of error can be achieved provided that the length of the channel code goes to infinity @xcite .      in general ,",
    "the correlation between the two analog sources @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a real - valued random variable .",
    "specifically , for the gaussian sources we usually have @xmath12 in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this model contains several well - known models which are suited for video coding and sensor networks . for example , for @xmath15 or @xmath16 the gaussian correlation is obtained , which is broadly used in the literature when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are gaussian .",
    "further , for @xmath17 the gbg and for @xmath18 , @xmath19 the ge models are realized .",
    "the latter two models are more suitable for video applications @xcite .",
    "these models are also used for evaluating theoretical bounds and performance limits @xcite .",
    "although the correlation between continuous - valued sources can be modeled more accurately in the continuous domain , practically it is usually modeled in the binary domain .",
    "this is due to the fact that , even for continuous - valued sources , compression is mostly done through the use of binary channel codes .",
    "to do so , the two sources are quantized and their correlation is modeled by a virtual bsc in the binary domain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_subfig1 ] . in the next section , however , we show that this assumption is not very accurate , and we propose an alternative , more accurate model .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two continuous - valued sources . when using binary channel codes for compression , @xmath8 and @xmath20 need to be quantized before compression.then , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_subfig1 ] , the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath21 ( the binary representation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) is defined in the binary domain by means of a bsc .",
    "we observe that this model is not very accurate .",
    "this is because the bits resulting from quantization of a sample and its corresponding side information are not independent .",
    "for example , if @xmath22 ( a sample of @xmath23 ) and its counterpart @xmath24 are the same , then all bits resulted from those samples will be identical .",
    "that is , the correlation between these bits can not be modeled independently .",
    "a more quantitative example is obtained by considering the model in and with @xmath15 .",
    "hence , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "now if @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the quantization step size , we will have @xmath29 .",
    "this means that in @xmath5 ( the binary representation of @xmath9 ) , most probably only the first two lower significant bits will be affected . in other words ,",
    "higher significant bits of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are similar with high probability .",
    "numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : bscs ] verifies this observation .",

    "is defined by , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "quantization is done using a @xmath33-bit scalar uniform quantizer . ]",
    "the above discussion indicates that at low channel - error - to - quantization noise ratios ( @xmath34 ) the higher significant bits of @xmath35 ( error in the binary domain ) are 0 , with high probability .",
    "therefore , correlation parameters differ depending on the bit position ( bit - plane ) ; i.e. , an independent error in the sample ( continuous ) domain can not be translated to an i.i.d .",
    "error in the binary domain .",
    "conversely , a bitwise correlation with a same parameter for all bit positions is not suited for continuous - valued sources .    in the remaining of this paper , a novel approach",
    "is proposed to deal with this problem .",
    "the key is to find a way to effectively model and implement the aforementioned dependency .",

    "( xblank3.six south ) ;      it is clear that the bits generated from different samples of a source ( say @xmath22 and @xmath70 ) are independent as long as these samples are generated independently .",
    "also , considering the correlation in continuous domain , it can be seen that the same argument is valid for the binary representation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "that is , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent if they are generated from different samples .",
    "this is because @xmath22 is related to @xmath24 ( through @xmath73 ) but it is independent from @xmath74 for any @xmath75 .",
    "this indicates that , using a @xmath76-bit quantizer , @xmath76 bscs are enough to efficiently model the correlation between the two correlated continuous - valued sources ; each of these channels is used to model the correlation between bits corresponding to one bit - plane .",
    "for one thing , @xmath77 is used to model the correlation between the msb s of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the binary domain .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_subfig2 ] . numerical results , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bscs ] , confirm that these channels have different parameters .",
    "moreover , with high probability , at low and moderate channel noises we have @xmath78 where the indices @xmath79 to @xmath76 , respectively , represent the channel corresponding to the lsb to msb .",
    "this is intuitively appealing because even a small error in continuous domain ( @xmath73 ) can invert the lsb while the msb is affected only with large errors .",
    "note that the parameter of the conventional single bsc model is obtained by @xmath80 we next discuss the incorporation of this new model into the dsc framework that uses ldpc codes for compression .",
    "in this section , we present three different implementations of the introduced correlation model in the slepian - wolf coding based on ldpc codes .",
    "these are named parallel , sequential , and hybrid decoding .",
    "a first idea is to divide the input sequence into @xmath76 sub - streams each of which contains only the bits with the same significance .",
    "now each channel can be modeled by one bsc with its own parameter .",
    "hence , we can implement @xmath76 _ parallel _ ldpc decoders each corresponding to one correlation channel .",
    "this implies @xmath76 ldpc decoders at the decoding center , which increases the complexity .",
    "particularly , effective compression requires codes with different rates , as the parameter of bsc channel for different bit - planes is different .",
    "then , the code corresponding to the msb , for example , will have the highest rate , as it has the smallest @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "given a same code for all channels the msb will be decoded with the lowest ber . given a same ldpc code for all channels , the complexity increases @xmath76 times , in the new approach ; the delay is the same assuming that the input of all decoders are available at the reciever .      by using _",
    "sequential _ decoding , the number of decoders can be reduced to one at the cost of increased delay .",
    "to do so , we let the decoder decode different sub - streams sequentially .",
    "note that each time the ldpc decoder is initialized with the corresponding @xmath81 .",
    "it can be seen that , compared to the parallel decoding , the complexity reduces @xmath76 times while the delay increases @xmath76 times .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that in order for decoder to reconstruct one sample of @xmath8 , it must wait for the output of @xmath76 ldpc blocks .",
    "a yet more efficient integration of the new correlation model into the ldpc - based dsc can be achieved just by using a single ldpc encoder / decoder .",
    "this is done in two steps , as explained in the following .",
    "the parameters of the multiple - bsc correlation model can be incorporated into the ldpc - based dsc by judiciously setting the llr sent from ( to ) the variable nodes .",
    "the idea is to take into account the bit - plane to which each bit belongs .",
    "this requires a slight change in the standard ldpc decoding algorithm .",
    "specifically , using the notation in @xcite , we just need to adjust the llr sent from ( to ) the variable nodes .",
    "that is , equation ( 1 ) in @xcite will be modified as @xmath82}{\\mathrm{pr}[x_i=1|y_i]}=(1 - 2y_i)\\log \\frac{1-p_k[i]}{p_k[i]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath83 , @xmath84 \\in \\{p_1 , \\dotsc , p_b \\}$ ] , and @xmath85 represents the bit - plane to which @xmath86 ( or @xmath71 ) belongs .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldpc ] . for example ,",
    "if @xmath71 is the lsb , in its corresponding sample , then @xmath87 . note that if @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the code length , then @xmath90 .",
    "since the initial llr s become more accurate in this method , the number of iterations required to achieve a same performance reduces .",
    "however , the performance gap is still noticeable . to bridge this gap , we propose to interleave the input data ( and side information ) in the binary domain .      as we discussed in section",
    "[ sec : newcor ] , the bits corresponding to each error sample , which are located in a row , are correlated . by interleaving @xmath4 and @xmath5 before feeding them into the slepian - wolf encoder and decoder , these successive bits can be shuffled to introduce randomness to the errors .",
    "then , it makes better sense to encode data belonging to all bit - planes altogether as in the conventional approach .",
    "the longer the permutation block input , the more accurate the model and the better the performance .",
    "interleaving , however , can increase the delay at the receiver side since we need deinterleaving after the slepian - wolf decoder . to avoid excessive delay , we set the length of interleaving block equal to the length of the ldpc code .",
    "the improvement in the ber and mse , only due to interleaving , is remarkably high .",
    "obviously , we can use interleaving and llr s manipulation simultaneously ; this requires applying interleaving to the crossover probabilities , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldpc ] , as well .",
    "another important advantage of this approach is that it can be used to combat the bursty correlation channels , as a perfect interleaver transforms a bursty channel into an independently distributed channel .",
    "the bursty correlation channel model is capable of addressing the bursty nature of the correlation between sources in applications such as sensor networks and video coding , since it takes the memory of the correlation into account @xcite .",
    "in this section , we numerically compare the new decoding algorithm with the conventional approach which considers just one bsc for the correlation model .",
    "we use irregular ldpc code of rate @xmath91 with the degree distribution @xcite @xmath92 the frame length is @xmath93 and the bit error rate ( ber ) and corresponding mean - squared error ( mse ) are measured after 50 itinerations in both schemes . the source @xmath8 is a zero mean , unit variance gaussian . also the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is defined by ge channel with @xmath31 , @xmath32 in , and channel - error - to - quantization - noise ratio ( @xmath94 ) varies as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig2 ] .",
    "both sources are quantized with a 6-bit scalar uniform quantizer .",
    "simulation results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig1]-fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig3 ] . in these figures ,",
    "the  actual data \" refers to the case where binary sequences @xmath4 and @xmath5 are obtained from quantizing @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also compute the ber for the case that side information @xmath5 is generated by passing @xmath4 through a virtual bsc with parameter @xmath3 , which is conventional in practical slepian - wolf coding @xcite .",
    "this is labeled as  artificial data . \"",
    "the fact that  actual \" and  artificial \" side information result in very different bers , by itself , indicates that a single bsc is not an appropriate model for correlation between continuous - valued sources . on the contrary , the ber resulted from hybrid decoding with actual side information is significantly better than that of the conventional approach which shows the suitability of the new model .",
    "figure  [ fig : subfig2 ] represents the corresponding mse . from these figures",
    ", it can be seen that the new scheme ( hybrid decoding ) greatly outperforms the existing method , for actual data .",
    "furthermore , as shown is fig .",
    "[ fig : subfig3 ] , the number of iterations required to achieve such a performance is much smaller than the existing method , owing to more accurate initial llrs .    [",
    "fig : simulations ]    the performance of parallel and sequential decoding , for a same code , are the same .",
    "these schemes benefit from the advantage of working over data belonging to separate bit - planes . hence , one bsc can effectively approximate the corresponding correlation for each bit - plane .",
    "simulation results verify that separate compression of data belonging to different bit - planes that uses actual data is as effective as the case that uses artificial side information .",
    "moreover , there is no need for interleaving .",
    "however , an efficient compression , in parallel and sequential decoding , requires codes with different rates for each bit - plane .",
    "alternatively , this can be implemented through the use of rate - adaptive ldpc codes @xcite .",
    "we have introduced an improved model for the virtual correlation between the continuous - valued sources in the binary domain .",
    "this model exploits multiple bscs rather than the conventional single - bsc model so that it can deal with the dependency among the bits resulting from quantization of each error sample by converting the error sequence into multiple i.i.d",
    ". sequences .",
    "an efficient implementation of the new model is realized just by using a single ldpc decoder but judiciously setting the llr sent from ( to ) the variable nodes .",
    "the number of iterations required to achieve the same performance reduces noticeably as a result of this prudent setting of initial llrs . besides ,",
    "by interleaving the data and side information the bits belonging to one error sample are shuffled which increases the performance of the decoding to a great extent .",
    "this significant improvement in the ber and mse is achieved without any increase in the complexity or delay .",
    "the new scheme can also be used to combat the bursty nature of the correlation channel in practical applications .",
