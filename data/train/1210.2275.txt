    "plasma oscillations in semiconductor two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems have been studied since late 1960-ies @xcite .",
    "plasmon related absorption resonances have been observed in different semicondutor structures ( inversion layers@xcite , quantum wells@xcite , wires@xcite , dots@xcite , antidots@xcite , rings@xcite ) and in the broad frequency range from microwaves ( the frequency @xmath0 ghz ) up to far - infrared ( @xmath1 thz ) .",
    "both the frequency and the linewidth of plasma resonances were found in good agreement with theoretical predictions .    in graphene@xcite , a new truly 2d material with very attractive physical properties@xcite ,",
    "the spectrum of plasma waves was first calculated in 2006 - 2007 @xcite , see also @xcite . however , the number of experimental studies of graphene plasmons is not very large , in spite of great interest to this material .",
    "their observation by the electron energy loss @xcite and far - infrared transmission @xcite spectroscopy has been reported only in few papers , see also @xcite . in all experimental studies",
    "the linewidth of plasmon resonances was found to be comparable with or even larger than their frequency , although graphene samples with the mobility of 200000 @xmath2/vs are currently available .",
    "recently , it was theoretically shown @xcite that the width of the classical cyclotron resonance ( cr ) should be substantially broader in graphene than in semiconductors due to the strongly non - parabolic ( linear ) energy dispersion of graphene electrons _ *",

    "in fact , it was found that the spectrum ( [ lin - spec ] ) leads to a broad observed cr linewidth even in perfectly pure graphene , in the absence of any scattering or other energy - loss mechanisms .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study whether the linear electronic spectrum ( [ lin - spec ] ) may be also responsible for the broadening of plasma resonances in graphene . using a non - perturbative kinetic approach we study the motion of massless quasiparticles ( [ lin - spec ] ) in a finite - width stripe of graphene with a parabolic confinement potential and",
    "show that , indeed , the observed plasmon resonance line should be strongly asymmetric and have the width comparable with the plasmon frequency .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with observations of refs .",
    "the plasma oscillations in a solid can be modeled as a collective motion of electrons in an external potential produced by a positively charged background . for example , in a three - dimensional metallic slab occupying the area @xmath4 , see inset to figure [ geom]a , the positive background with the charge density @xmath5 creates the electric potential ( x)=-2\\ {    ll ( 2x / w)^2 ,  &  |2x / w|1 , + 4|x|/w-1 ,  &  |2x / w|>1 . +    . ,",

    "[ kvalue ] the motion of all electrons in the stripe is then described by the harmonic oscillator equation of the type ( [ mx .. ] ) with the squared oscillation frequency @xmath13 , which differs by only 10% from the numerically calculated @xcite plasma frequency in a finite - width 2d stripe .    due to the linear energy dispersion ( [ lin - spec ] )",
    "the dynamics of graphene quasi - particles substantially differs from that of electrons in semiconductors . in the absence of scattering their oscillations in the field of the positive background",

    "min = = 4 , [ freq - min ] see figure [ linewidth ] .",
    "particles with smaller momenta oscillate with higher frequencies , therefore the observed 2d plasmon resonance line should have a broad asymmetric form with a flatter high - frequency and a steeper low - frequency side , figure [ linewidth ] .",

    "similar to the classical cyclotron resonance @xcite , the 2d plasmon line broadening takes place in the collisionless limit , in the absence of any scattering in the graphene sample .",
    "taking into account the finite scattering rate would lead to a somewhat smoother curve and to an additional broadening of the line .",
    "the collisionless broadening of the 2d plasmon resonance line is a direct consequence of the linear energy dispersion ( [ lin - spec ] ) and is related with the violation of the generalized kohn theorem @xcite in electronic systems with a non - parabolic energy dispersion .",

    "they are substantially different : our calculations give a finite - width resonance line in the collisionless limit , while those of refs .",
    "@xcite give a vanishing linewidth under the same conditions .",
    "we believe that the reason of this difference results from the non - analyticity of the graphene spectrum ( [ lin - spec ] ) in the dirac point @xmath36 .",
    "the solution of the equations of motion ( [ eqgr ] ) is equivalent to a _ non - perturbative _ solution of the boltzmann kinetic equation . in refs .",
    "@xcite the _ linear response _ approach was applied , i.e. the solution of the kinetic equation was expanded , from the very beginning , in powers of the electric field and only the first - order term was taken into account .",
    "mathematically , such a procedure suggests that all coefficients of the kinetic equation are analytical functions of @xmath37 , which is the case in semiconductor structures but is not the case in graphene . in order to fully understand the graphene response to external electromagnetic fields a more detailed _ non - perturbative _ classical ( boltzmann ) or quantum theory",
    "is thus required .    to summarize",
    ", we have predicted that the 2d plasmon resonance line should be asymmetric and substantially broadened , even in perfectly clean graphene ( without disorder ) due to the linear energy dispersion of graphene electrons .",
