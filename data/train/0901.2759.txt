    "they both receive @xmath2 upon mutual @xmath0 and @xmath3 upon mutual @xmath1 .",
    "a defector gets @xmath4 when it plays game with cooperator who gets @xmath5 . in pdg",
    ", we have @xmath6 and @xmath7 . because the mutual @xmath0 get the highest total income , @xmath1 is the better choice than @xmath0 no mater what the other player s strategy . without any mechanism for the evolution of cooperation ,",
    "natural selection favors defection .",
    "the other widely studied games include snowdrift game  @xcite , public good game  @xcite , rock - paper - scissors game  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the complex network has also attracted lots of attentions in the past few years .",
    "the complex network is ubiquitous in nature .",
    "the human society can also be described as the systems composed of interacting agents .",
    "the classical social network maps the individual into the node , and the connection between individuals into the link .",
    "the evolutionary game theory in spatial structure has became a unifying paradigm to study how cooperation may be sustained in a structured population  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the spatial extension is one of several natural mechanisms to enforce cooperation .",

    "the cooperation is usually get together to support each other to resist the defection  @xcite .",
    "santos and pacheco found in scale - free networks the strong correlation leads to the dominating trait throughout the entire range of parameters of both games in scale - free networks  @xcite . and also , there are anmount of researches on other networks , like small - world  @xcite and random network  @xcite",
    ".    when the player on the structure network chose the better strategy to play game , in fact , not that the players select the proper strategy , but player s strategy is determined by the network structure .",
    "for example , in scale - free networks , the large degree nodes ( hubs ) and the nodes which connect to hubs tend to be occupied by @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the networks used in the most papers of this field are statistic .",
    "the connection will never change once it is build .",
    "it is not realistic enough , as the interactions themselves help shape the network  @xcite .",
    "what is more , in the real world , the relationship between the people is not constant .",
    "sometimes people can not cut some relationship with their relatives , neighbors or colleagues but they can end their old relationship and build a new one . sometimes this changing is caused by the results of the game , because people would like to make friends in a reciprocal respect .",
    "for example , people always like to make friends with rich one for a sake of pursuing fortune .",
    "so , when we study the social model in network like pdg , the network structure should be dynamical entities  @xcite .",
    "the nodes can remove or sustain their link in network according to the game results .",
    "till now , there are few models studied the cooperative behaviors in a groups with adaptive connections . besides some early work  @xcite ,",

    ". however , the link could change even if the nodes strategy do not change in their model .",
    "the rewire of link in this model is not the player s own decision .",

    "network structure should contain two features : ( 1 ) the nodes rewire their links only when agents change their status ; ( 2 ) the rewiring should be based on the playing results of game . in this paper , we will present a coevolution model of the pdg and network .",
    "we use pdg as a metaphor to studying cooperation between unrelated individuals and consider a social networks with four fixed local links and one adjustable long - range link ( lrl ) .",
    "the agents in the network play game with their network neighbors .",
    "they will change their strategies and adjust lrls according to the results of game .",
    "then the network structure changing also affect the cooperation density .",
    "we set up a system of @xmath10 players arranged at the nodes of a ring lattice network .",
    "each node is connected with four local nodes .",
    "these local interactions will not change during the whole process of the evolution . besides four fixed links , every node in this lattice has an adjustable lrl which connects to another node and self - connections and the duplicate links",

    "[ tab1 ] , @xmath67 is the cooperation density of an and @xmath68 is for bn .",
    "almost all nodes of ans chose the strategy @xmath0 , so we do not need to present the mean payoff of an with @xmath1 .",

    "it means that the existence of an does not affect the strategy density of bn . as discussed in ref",
    "@xcite , an can resist the temptation of @xmath15 by mimicking the strategy of hn .",

    "moreover , before the sharp increasing happened , one can observe many black blocks ( the upper part of the left panel in figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it means the model has the similar feature of pdg in regular network that the @xmath0 node tends to get together for blocks to resist the @xmath1 .",
    "these blocks start at a few @xmath0s , maybe three or more , and then close to each other in the network coincidentally . then a block is established and it will grow to change their neighbors strategies .",
    "after some mc steps , the block will shrink and then disappears in the last .",
    "after the sharp increasing of @xmath65 , there are too few red dots ( @xmath1 in an ) .",
    "the green strip ( @xmath0 in an ) indicates that the ans or bns are very stable in the network .",
    "the probability of an change to bn is very small and vice versa .",
    "based on the results in the above context , the effect of @xmath34 is different from various @xmath15 and @xmath34 . after the sharp increasing",
    ", the nodes in network can be divided into an and bn . almost all an are @xmath0 and the density of @xmath0 in bn is close to the case of @xmath35 .",

    "we neglect self - connection and multi - connection forbidden and we have @xmath86 here .",
    "because an has the same strategy with hn , an only mimics the strategy from other @xmath87 neighbors .",
    "the big fraction is the probability of an do not chose hn to mimic the strategy . the last @xmath88 is the probability of mimicked target with strategy @xmath1 .",
    "we assume @xmath89 is the probability of success in the mimicking .",
    "then @xmath81 will be more complicate .",
    "we assume that bn change to an because they use the preferential rewiring .",
