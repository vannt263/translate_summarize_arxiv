    "scintillating fiber trackers have already been realized using _ _ visible - light photon counters__@xcite or _ _ multi - anode photomultiplier tubes__@xcite as photodectors .",
    "multi - anode pmts do not exhibit a sufficiently high photodetection efficiency ( generally around @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) to encourage their use for a high precision scifi tracker using very thin scintillating fibers which yield only a small number of photons for a traversing minimal ionizing particle .",
    "vlpcs on the other hand require a significant overhead since they require operating temperatures of @xmath2 .",
    "sipms achieve high photodetection efficiencies ( pde ) of over @xmath3@xcite and allow for operation at room temperature ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore novel sipm arrays with very densely packed channels allow for a compact design ( see fig .",
    "[ figsipmarray ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     sipm arrays with an area of @xmath5 and 32 readout cells , each sensitive cell covering an area of @xmath6 , are used for column - wise fiber readout .",
    "the sipm arrays are mounted on alternating ends of the fiber modules along with an integrated preamplifier and digitization solution .",
    "the respective opposing ends of the fibers are covered by a reflective coating .",
    "a dedicated monte carlo simulation , using the geant4@xcite package , has been developed for comparison to and generalization of the testbeam results@xcite . a key question to be answered was the spatial resolution obtained with a fiber module as a function of the mean photoelectron yield @xmath7 of the fiber - sipm chain ( see fig .",
    "[ figspatial ] ) . for the photo electron yield achieved in the testbeam , a spatial resolution of @xmath8",
    "is obtained at the mean projected angle of incidence , which is @xmath9 for the pebs geometry .",
    "the testbeam results indicate that this concept for a high - resolution scifi / sipm tracker is technically feasible .",
    "the average yield of 5.4 photoelectrons with a reflective foil on one fiber end and the sspm-0606exp sipms is acceptable .",
    "sipms with a reduced pixel density and a @xmath10 higher pde are commercially available from hamamatsu and will be tested thoroughly during the next test beam in fall 2007 . the light output from scintillating fibers",
    "can be improved by @xmath11 using fibers without white coating as measurements with different fiber coatings conducted for the cream experiment have shown@xcite .    a spatial resolution as good as @xmath12 is possible , depending on the granularity of the readout , the quality of the sipms , the qualtity of the optical coupling of the fibers to the sipms and the type of fibers used . for the final tracker an average spatial resolution of @xmath13",
    "is expected .",
