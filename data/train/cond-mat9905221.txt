    "in our recent short paper [ 1 ] we had provided new derivation of spitzer s law [ 2 ] for brownian windings .",
    "this problem is of some importance in polymer physics since it allows to define the concept of entanglement in precise mathematical terms .",
    "it is also of relewance to other disciplines , e.g. 2 + 1 gravity , quantum hall effect , etc . due to format limitations of our paper[1 ]",
    "many important topics were either briefly mentioned or not discussed at all .",
    "this paper serves to correct this deficiency .",
    "if the reader will have patience to go over the entire manuscript , he or she will recognize , that , still , this much longer paper is just an introduction into the very rich field of various topological problems which are waiting for development .",
    "in particular , in this work we had only briefly mentioned the hyperbolic groups ( in section 6 ) while this has become a very large area of research in mathematics[3 ] .study of random walks on hyperbolic groups and their associated graphs reveals that , for example , the notion of ultrametricity which is used in the theory of spin glasses[4 ] is just a special case of hyperbolicity.hence , the static and dynamic problems associated with spin glasses , glasses in general , and all other cases which involve replicas , could be studied without replicas by properly formulating the ultrametric problems within the scope of the hyperbolic group methods.the steps in this direction were already made by mathematicians[5 ] but large amount of work is still waiting for development .",
    "also , the issues related to symbolic dynamic and finite state automata interpretation of the results presented in this paper were left completely outside the scope of this paper .",
    "interested reader can , in part , correct this deficiency by reading recent review article by adler[6 ] .",
    "this paper had been also motivated to some extent by the recent papers in physics literature where one and the same mathematical object is being treated by completely different methods .",
    "specifically , in ref.[7 ] the authors study the extension of the results of aharonov - bohm [ 8 ] to the case of  two magnetic fluxes while in ref.[9 ] quantum mechanics in the rectangular billiard with single pointlike scatterer was studied .",
    "subsequently , the results of the last paper were improved [ 10 ] and generalized to many scatterers in ref.[11 ] . to this list of papers",
    ", one may add ref.[12],etc.,while in ref.[13 ] the random walks on the disordered cellular networks were studied . in this paper",
    "it is shown , that all these problems are interrelated and , therefore , could be treated using the same mathematical methods.moreover , other problems could be studied by these methods as well and some of these problems are discussed in section 7 . in particular , by analogy with the aharonov - bohm problem in two dimensions which had become a sort of hydrogen atom - like problem to all problems which involve physical processes in the multiply connected spaces , in three dimensions one can think of a problem about random walks in the presence of nontrivial knots mentioned already in our earlier work , ref[14 ] .",
    "such problem may have at least some biological significance since it is important to know to what extent diffusion processes are being affected by the topology of , say , knotted dna . in this work",
    ", we use the same methods as that developed for the treatment of random walks on figure eight in order to provide some solutions to the problem of random walks in the presence of knots .",
    "alternative methods of solution of this problem are discussed in ref.[15 ] .",
    "we also reconsider the dynamics of area - preserving toral homeo(diffeo)morphisms[16 ] from the point of view of random walks on the teichmller modular group.such reconsideration is useful for several reasons.first , it allows to discuss new ways of classifying chaotic and nonchaotic systems through the associated with them 3-manifolds.second , it is very useful for the description of dynamics of textures in liquid crystals and particles in 2 + 1 gravity . in this paper , naturally , above topics are studied only in passing so that interested reader is encouraged to read our recent papers [ 17 ] for better understanding of all aspects of these problems . in this work we demonstrate how the figure 8 problem is related to the solution of david hilbert s 21st problem ( in section 5).in the same section we discuss how this problem is connected with the theory of exactly integrable systems , knizhnik - zamolodchikov equations , quantum groups , theory of elasticity .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our presentation is not just a review of literature : each section contains worked out examples which are original in nature.at the same time , some mathematical facts are presented along with these developments to facilitate the uninterrupted reading of the manuscript .    in section 2",
    "some old results related to random walks on once punctured plane are revisited from the point of view of the results of ito and mckean[18],lyons and mckean[19 ] and mckean and sullivan[20 ] .",
    "the rest of the paper could be considered as various attempts to extend , to reanalyze and to generalize their results to the case of multiple punctures .the guiding principle in doing this is associated with various aspects of random walks on groups , mainly free groups .",
    "the comprehensive mathematically rigorous and physically readable review of  this subject can be found in ref.[21 ] . in our work",
    "only very small portion of the available mathematical results is utilized . in section 3",
    "we introduce some concepts related to groups and group presentations  in order to use them in section 4 devoted to finding the function which connects the multiply connected trice punctured sphere - the space in which the random walk on figure 8 is taking place - to the simply connected universal covering riemann surface .",
    "although in case of trice punctured sphere such function can be found , generalization of the methods by which it was obtained to more than three punctures represents a formidable task associated with mathematical methods which so far had been used only in string theory.we discuss these methods in the same section and later , in section 7 , provide an introduction to the completely different approach to the whole problem based on mathematical ideas of grotendieck and belyi [ 22].the results of section 4 are being put in a broader context of riemann - hilbert problem and knizhnik - zamolodchikov equations in section 5 .",
    "this section also clarifies the connections with the gauge field - theoretic treatments of the same problems popular in physics literature [ 14].in section 6 we develop some results of kasteleyn[23 ] related to random walks on free groups.based on this development , we reobtain the results of lyons and mckean for transience / recurrence of random walks on the trice punctured sphere.we also provide in this section a definition of hyperbolic groups and hyperbolic spaces and show that the ultrametric spaces(used in the theory of spin glasses[4 ] ) are just special cases of hyperbolic spaces .",
    "the results obtained in this section are further developed in section 7 . in this section ,",
    "solely devoted to applications , we discuss several topics .",
    "in particular , we discuss random walks in the presence of knots .",
    "we demonstrate that the transience / recurrence of random walks in the presence of a knot depends upon its nature.for example , random walk on figure 8 is related to the random walk in the complement of the figure 8 knot and , hence , is transient while random walk in the complement of the trefoil knot(the simplest among torus - type knots ) is recurrent .",
    "next , we discuss the chaotic v.s",
    ". regular behavior of such walks by analyzing their behavior with help of  number - theoretic methods , by using the theory of teichmller spaces and by employing some facts from the theory of 3-manifolds.these methods provide new efficient ways of description of chaotic systems and are potentially useful for treatments of dynamics of liquid crystals and 2 + 1 gravity .",
    "naturally , these topics are treated only superficially in this paper , but , we hope , that many illustrations which we supply along the way , should be helpful for better understanding and appreciation of much deeper results available in mathematics[24 ] and used in our earlier works[17 ] for treatment of these physical problems.this section is finished with several additional applications .",
    "for instance , use of markov triples , known in the number theory for more than a century [ 25 ] along with the results of grotendieck and belyi[22 ] provides us with an opportunity to introduce an alternative explanation of the fractional hall effect .",
    "these results are also complementary to that presented in section 4 .",
    "we also discuss some connections between the results the theory of free groups and the theory of braids .",
    "such discussion reveals advantages and disadvantages of either methods for studying evolution of random walks in multiply connected spaces .",
    "study of random walks on once punctured plane is closely related to the aharonov - bohm ( a - b ) effect in quantum mechanics [ 8].although this problem was studied very thoroughly , here we would like to emphasize some of its aspects which , to our knowledge , had received much less attention . in particular , we would like to investigate how the description of random walks on once punctured plane @xmath0 is related to the description of the random walks on the circle @xmath1the last problem was studied in great detail by schulman [ 26 , 27 ] and is considered to be the benchmark problem associated with quantization in multiply connected spaces [ 28 ] .",
    "although it is intuitively clear that both problems are connected , to establish such connection mathematically is nontrivial.let us begin with the observation that in both cases we are dealing with multiply connected spaces.the theory of differential equations on the punctured plane was initiated already by poincare and is known in the literature as the theory of fuchsian equations [ 29,30 ] .according to this theory , it is essential to find a simply connected ( covering ) space which is associated with multiply connected ( base ) space.then , the related problem is solved by lifting it to this covering ( simply connected ) space and then , the solution is projected down to the base space . to find a transformation from the base space space @xmath2 ( multiply connected ) to the covering space @xmath3 ( simply connected ) could be already a very difficult ( and even unsolvable ! ) problem .accordingly , some simplifications may be required in order to obtain at least a partial information.the circle @xmath4 and the punctured plane @xmath0 represent a good examples of use of general methods outlined above and are ideally suited for study of simplifications .",
    "fortunately , both problems could be solved completely so that they could be considered as having the same status in the theory of diffusion / quantum mechanical problems in multiply connected spaces as the hydrogen atom problem in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the universal covering space @xmath3 for the circle problem is real line * r * so that * * s**@xmath5 where * z * is the set of all integers .for the random walk of n effective steps on * r * we expect our distribution ( green s ) function to be transitionally invariant , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the green s function ( end - to - end distribution function ) for the random walk on * r * and @xmath8 is the initial ( final ) position of the walk in this space.surely , eq.(2.1 ) can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath9 where @xmath10 the above example can be easily generalized now .",
    "let @xmath11 be some generator of motion(s ) on @xmath3 , @xmath12where @xmath13 is some group of motions on @xmath3 , then , in general , we should require @xmath14 since this result holds for eq.s(2.1 ) and(2.2 ) .",
    "the above equation can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath15 this follows easily if we replace @xmath16 by @xmath17 in eq.(2.3 ) . in the case of quantum mechanics",
    "the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath2 is made via @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the phase factor , @xmath20",
    "which is subject to the cocycle constraint [ 31 , 32 ] @xmath21 this constraint follows easily from the composition law ( markov property ) for propagators .    in the case of punctured plane",
    "the phase factor @xmath22 is actually responsible for changes in statistics and/or for particle - hole interactions . in the case of * * s**@xmath23 the phase @xmath24or @xmath25 is associated with bosons ( or fermions)[26].there is yet another interpretation of the phase factor.it comes from the polymer physics .in",
    "ref.[14 ] we had demonstrated that the description of the random walks on * * s**@xmath23 can be associated with the description of random walks ( polymers)which are confined between the parallel plates ( or planes)with which these walks are allowed to interact.the interactions are effectively introducing statistics so that , depending on their strength , the polymer chain acts as bosonic or fermionic quantum particle or as a particle with fractional statistics .",
    "the result given by eq.(2.5 ) still deserves some additional comments.let us discuss the case of a simple random walk so that we can put @xmath26already in eq.(2.2 ) we had introduced the fundamental domain @xmath27 : 0@xmath28 so that the translations producing * r * are created by the successive use of @xmath11 applied to some x@xmath29this simple result should hold in more general cases too.that is , we expect that the manifold @xmath2 should be expressible as a quotient @xmath30 .more intuitively,@xmath2 should be related tosome fundamental domain in @xmath3 so that the whole @xmath3 is being covered ( without gaps ! ) by translations of the fundamental domain with help of the group elements @xmath31 consider , therefore , instead of eq.(2.5),its modification @xmath32 let @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 we would like to demonstrate now that @xmath36 indeed , using eq.(2.8),we obtain @xmath37 using eq.(2.4 ) , we obtain as well @xmath38 since @xmath39this proves eq.(2.9 ) . using this result , it is possible to prove the following    * theorem*. * *  2.1.**__let _ _ @xmath40 _ _  be the distribution function for the random walk on the covering space _ _ @xmath3 _ _  which possesses property reflected in eq.(2.9 ) , then the distribution function on the base space _",

    "let us illustrate the above general statements on example of the random walk on @xmath48using dimensionless units we obtain the following diffusion equation , @xmath49 where the factor @xmath50 ( the diffusion coefficient ) is chosen for further convenience and @xmath51 with @xmath52 it is convenient to rewrite eq.(2.13 ) in terms of complex variables:@xmath53 simple calculation produces then @xmath54 since this equation is not defined for @xmath55 , we would like to introduce new complex variable @xmath56 via @xmath57 unlike z , the complex variable @xmath58 is defined on the entire complex @xmath59plane.in terms of @xmath59variable eq.(2.14 ) can be rewritten as @xmath60 obtained equation describes brownian motion on a simply connected covering space @xmath3 which is the riemann surface of the logarithmic function , i.e .",

    "eq.(2.18 ) coincides with that presented on page 280 of ito and mckean [ 18 ] where it was given without derivation . in spite of its simple form ,",
    "thus transformed diffusion equation will depend upon the random time t since @xmath68 is brownian motion .",
    "accordingly , the observables calculated with help of such diffusion equation will require an extra averaging .this may sometimes be inconvenient in practical calculations .to",
    "recognize this difficulty we shall discuss a generic example which exhibits all the features involved . before doing so , several remarks are in order .",
    "first , it is clear , that in more general case of multiple punctures one has to find an analogue of eq.(2.16 ) , i.e. to find some function @xmath69 such that @xmath59plane ( actually riemann surface ) is going to be an universal covering space @xmath3 which is simply connected by construction .",
    "second , to find such function is not an easy task and may not be possible in general , e.g.sections 4 and 7 below.nevertheless,if such function can be found , then , by analogy with eq.(2.15 ) , we will be able to write @xmath70 and , accordingly , the new time can be defined as @xmath71 so that the diffusion equation , eq.(2.19 ) , again acquires its canonical form given by eq.(2.13 ) in accord with general result by paul levi[33 ] .",
    "let us now return back to our example of once punctured plane.in this case , the explicit form of the end - to- end distribution function is well known , e.g .",
    "see refs.[14,18,35 ] , and in polar system of coordinates it is given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the modified bessel s function .",
    "the above distribution function can be used either for study of the radial or the angular distributions or both .",
    "suppose , we are interested in the angular distribution function only .then , using eq.(2.21),it is convenient to introduce the normalized distribution function defined according to the following prescription : @xmath75 the fourier transform of such defined distribution function can now be obtained in a standard way as @xmath76 let us now choose @xmath77this choice is motivated by known scaling properties of brownian motion [ 34 ] .",

    "let us now reproduce this result with help of the random time change discussed above.to this purpose , let us begin with the classical lagrangian @xmath89 for the fictitious brownian particle traveling in the punctured plane . by introducing polar system of",

    "following the same line of arguments as that which had lead us from eq.(2.13 ) to ( 2.15 ) let us represent @xmath92variable through @xmath93variable defined by @xmath94surely , for @xmath95we have @xmath96 as required .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath89 is now being converted to @xmath97 which , in view of eq.(2.27 ) , should have its analogue in eq.(2.15).consider now the change of time variable inside of the path integral in eq.(2.27).that is we have @xmath98 so that , for example , @xmath99 this then requires us to make a choice for @xmath100 which is identical with that made in eq.(2.18 ) so that in terms of new time @xmath65 our path integral , eq.(2.27 ) , represents , indeed , a free diffusion process in which @xmath44 and @xmath101 are two independent brownian motions in accord with our previous calculations .",

    "by now , it should become clear that even for 3 punctures in the plane the path integral approach developed in section 2 becomes nonpractical.in current literature the situation with 3 or more punctures is treated with help of an auxiliary abelian or nonabelian gauge fields as described in our phys.reports , ref[14 ] .",

    "hence , for n@xmath505 the walk is transient and this result is in accord with results obtained by lyons and mckean[19 ] and mckean and sullivan[20 ] who used different methods .",
    "for n=1 the walk is recurrent , since @xmath506 and this result is in accord with earlier obtained in section 2 for 2 punctures one of which being located at infinity.we would like now to reproduce this result using the theory of random walks on groups.this is needed for various reasons discussed in the introduction , below , and to be discussed in the next section.to begin , following kasteleyn[23 ] , we consider an analogue of eq.(6.14 ) for group elements(letters ) @xmath507 of some free group @xmath165 .",
    "let @xmath508 be the probability of creating the word @xmath174 of t letters starting from @xmath487 the markov chain equation analogous to eq.(6.14 ) can now be written as @xmath509 with @xmath510 being defined as * stepping * probability which is the probability of choosing a particular branch at each vertex of the tree . looking at fig.6",
    ", we can easily notice that it is exactly the same probability as for crossing the vertex of figure 8 ( in case of two generator group ) .",
    "surely , one can complicate matters by assigning different weights to different choices of crossing the vertex as it is done , for example , in the case of the ising model .",
    "such possibility immediately connects the walks on groups with various statistical mechanical models as discussed , for example , in ref.[80 ] .",
    "we shall in this work restrict our discussion to the simplest possible case , e.g. @xmath511 ( motivated by fig.6).as in the case of usual random walks[42 ] , it is convenient to introduce the generating function @xmath512 as follows @xmath513 this generating function obeys an equation of the following type @xmath514 so that the probability @xmath515 that a walk starting at @xmath486 will ever visit element @xmath174 ( excluding the start as visit to @xmath486 ) is given by @xmath516 the crucial moment now is to notice that , actually , @xmath517 where @xmath518 is given by eq.(6.9).at this moment kasteleyn claims that this observation allows one to determine @xmath512 with help of eq.(6.19 ) .",
    "since the details of the derivation are not provided in kasteleyn s paper , we restore these calculations in this work . to this purpose ,",
    "let us assume that solution could be sought in the form @xmath519 with @xmath520 being defined by eq.(6.3 ) .",
    "using these results in eq.(6.19 ) we obtain , @xmath521 let us notice now that the actual length of the combination @xmath522 is equal to one since in one step of the random walk only one letter is added or subtracted according to the definitions made above.finally , let @xmath523 and , since @xmath524 we obtain from eq.(6.22 ) the following result : @xmath525 since @xmath526 by construction.here @xmath527by combining eq.(6.13 ) with eq.(6.23 ) we obtain @xmath528 obtained result coincides  exactly with that obtained by kasteleyn , ref[23],e.g.see his eq.8 , where it was given without derivation.by combining eqs(6.21 ) and ( 6.25 ) we obtain the final result for @xmath512 which can be used now for calculation of @xmath529 in particular , for @xmath530 we obtain , using eq.(6.20 ) , @xmath531 in complete accord with earlier obtained eq.(6.16 ) .",
    "it should become clear by now , that consideration of random walks on groups provides practically as much information as one could possibly get by much more tedious calculations using the real - space approach .",
    "this is so because the group - theoretic  methods provide an equivalent and complete description of the underlying geometric and topological properties of a given manifold[3,75 - 77].we would like now to elaborate this observation in the next section .",
    "the recurrence / transience of random walks has actually numerous physical applications which had been mentioned already in our previous works[14 ] . to make our presentation self - contained",
    ", we would like to remind to our readers about some of these applications and to discuss additional physical applications in this section .",
    "first , the results of previous section can be used in the theory of polymer solutions[14 ] since they provide the exact mathematical formulation of the concept of entanglement through use of mathematically well defined concepts of recurrence and transience .",
    "it should be clear by now that the random walks on groups are * *  not at all * * limited to the planar problems since the homotopy of paths are not limited to two dimensions .",
    "in particular , one can think now about random walks in the presence of knots and links(the possibility mentioned already in our earlier work , ref[14 ] ) . from this reference we know that almost all flexible polymers are either knotted or quasiknotted in solution in case if their length l is large .",
    "formation of knots / links may affect both static and dynamic properties of polymer solutions and also polymer interfaces as is well known .",
    "nevertheless , to detect the presence of knots in solution is very nontrivial problem .",
    "fortunately , using methods developed in this work this problem may be solved to some extent .",
    "let us explain briefly how this can be done on examples of trefoil , fig.7 ,              knots.using either results of our appendix a2 of ref[14 ] or more specialized books on knot theory , e.g .",
    "ref[43],[81 ] , one obtains the following group presentations @xmath532 for the trefoil and @xmath533 for the figure 8 knot complement groups.we would like to remind our readers that the above group presentations are for the fundamental groups of the * complements * of these knots in s@xmath534(i.e.for s@xmath535 where @xmath287 is the knot of given type and s@xmath536it is being assumed that the knot has finite thickness ( framing ) so that the toroidal - like tunnel occupied by @xmath287 is removed from @xmath537 thus converting it to space with possibly very complicated topology .the cayley graph for the fundamental group of the trefoil is depicted in fig.9        while that for the figure 8 is depicted in fig.6 .",
    "fig.9 has rather complicated structure which was discovered by max dehn [ 82 ] whose dehn s twists we also going to discuss below.when viewed from above , one can see the three - valent bethe lattice(the terminology used in physics literature for the cayley graph[74 ] ) . at each vertex of such lattice",
    "three infinite ladders are glued together in an obvious way . to describe random  walks on such lattices",
    "is not an easy task and , besides , the presentation given by eq.(7.1 ) is * not * unique , for example , using results of ref[81 ] one obtains as well .",
    "@xmath538 with the corresponding cayley graph ( part of it ) depicted in fig.10 .        clearly , the random walk in the complement of the figure 8 knot is transient ( that is if one could make a solution of linear and circular knotted polymers which all are figure 8 knots , the linear polymers will become entangled with such knotted structures so that it will become practically impossible to separate  these two types of polymers).to determine the recurrence / transience for the complement of the trefoil knot requires some additional efforts which are worth spending , see the next subsection.already now few remarks are in place . just by looking at fig.10 one",
    "can make the following observations .",
    "if we collapse the solid line loops to lines and the dashed triangles to points , we would obtain three - valent bethe lattice as depicted in fig.9 .",
    "this lattice is the universal covering space for the triangle depicted in fig.11 .",
    "this is needed because , according to the existing rules , at given vertex only two edges of the same color(e.g .",
    "solid lines and/or dashed lines ) can meet.by looking at fig.10 this fact then explains why figure 8 complement is transient while that for the trefoil is recurrent .",
    "indeed , for the figure 8 we have at each vertex the probability 3/4 to go forward and only 1/4 to go backward while for the trefoil we get 1/2 to go forward and 1/2 to go backward , much like for the random walks on the line which represent the universal covering space for once punctured plane discussed in section 2 .",
    "surely , such walks are recurrent as it had been demonstrated already .",
    "since the entanglements affect both static and dynamic properties of polymer solutions , it is clear , that the presence of knotted structures should be important in changing these  properties .",
    "the presence of knotted structures is also important biologially since for * different * knots the first return and the escape times should be different .if the diffusion processes take place in the vicinity of such knotted structures , e.g .",
    "dna s , the outcomes will be different for different types of knots.this observation could be important in processes which involve the molecular recognition .",
    "let us however return to the problem of transience / recurrence for the random walks on fundamental groups for thefoil  and figure 8 in order to discuss additional very important aspects of the recurrence - transience problem .",

    "although in physics literature quantum mechanics of such  leaky torus  had been discussed [ 85 ] along with many generalizations[9 - 12 ] , including those which involve the quantum hall effect[86],e.g.aharonov - bohm effect under the periodic boundary conditions , etc.,surprisingly , the spectral analysis and other related aspects of the punctured torus are still at the forefront of research in mathematics[87].because of this , we would like to emphasize here some aspects of the problems related to punctured torus which had not been ( to our knowledge ) discussed in physics literature.following ref.[88 ] , it is convenient to group the generators @xmath156 and @xmath161 of the free group @xmath539 according to the following scheme : @xmath540{ccc}% ab & \\rightarrow &   l\\\\ ba & \\rightarrow &   l\\\\ ( bb)^{-1 } & \\rightarrow &   l\\\\ ab^{-1 } & \\rightarrow &   r\\\\ bb & \\rightarrow &   r\\\\ b^{-1}a & \\rightarrow &   r \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath252 and @xmath89 stand for  right  and  left  as it is usually done in symbolic dynamics[89].surely , the above correspondence ( automorphism ) is quite arbitrary and it is obvious that other possibilities could be tested .",
    "what is less trivial is to prove[90 ] that the totality of words generated by sequences given by eq.(3.4 ) coincides exactly with the totality of words of the type @xmath541 where [ n@xmath542,n@xmath543 , ... ] is continuous fraction expansion of some number , say @xmath544 recall [ 91 ] , that the continuous fraction for @xmath101 is actually given by @xmath545 the continuous fraction always stops if @xmath101 is rational number or it becomes periodic for some irrational numbers , e.g .",
    "those which come from solutions of quadratic equations , and it is infinite and nonperiodic for generic irrational @xmath101 .",
    "we would like now to argue that for the torus - type knots @xmath101 is always rational number while for hyperbolic knots , e.g. for figure 8 , @xmath101 should be irrational .",
    "since in the first case words have finite length this means that if we have one of such longest words , then multiplication by @xmath252 ( or by @xmath546 should make such word trivial , i.e. w=1 . the trivial word , when depicted graphically[83 ] , simply means that there is a closed loop in the graph .",
    "this , in turn , means that the motion is recurrent .if there are no closed loops , then the motion could be either transient or recurrent . .",
    "we had established this fact already in the previous section for the figure 8 .",
    "since the trefoil knot is associated with three - valent bethe lattice it means that the random walks on such lattices behave quite differently as compared with bethe lattices with vertices of even valency .",
    "this difference also should show up in various properties of statistical mechanical models on such graphs[80].in this work , naturally , we are not going to touch these subjects.let us now explain better how all this is associated with chaos . superficially , an infinite word , eq.(7.4 ) , made of totally random sequences of @xmath252 and @xmath89 already suggests chaoticity . in general , the word w may or may not be random .",
    "it may correspond to the sequence of base pairs along dna , to some number written in binary system , the sequence of  up  and  down  spins in ising -like model , to sequence of hits in the poincare return maps , etc .one can do still better than just these observations . to this purpose",
    "some knowledge of the knot theory is helpful and we refer our readers to the specialized literature , e.g .",
    "see refs[43,81 ] .",
    "let is begin with a very well known fact from the combinatorial group theory which is this .",
    "let g be free nonabelian group made of two generators @xmath156 and @xmath161 .",
    "let us construct a commutator @xmath547 , then the quotient @xmath165/@xmath548 is just an abelian group that is , instead of presentation given by eq.(3.5 ) , we obtain now @xmath549 and this is just the fundamental group of  the torus .",
    "such abelianization had effectively removed the puncture from the torus so that it became essentially the product of two circles with the group z@xmath550 of covering transformations instead of just z considered in section 2.this procedure of abelianization is characteristic not only for the punctured torus but for riemann surface of * any * genus g : it is sufficient to make just one hole in such surface in order to obtain the free group of 2 g generators.using this fact , one can prove the following related theorem    * theorem * 7.1 . _",

    "_  is just a free group of n generators where _ _",
    "@xmath553      the above theorem and the results presented in previous sections explain at once the results of ref[13 ] where the hyperbolicity of the disordered network was established using much longer chain of arguments .    going back to the torus case , one might think that the quantum mechanics on the torus is trivial . to a large extent",
    "this is the case , as compared with the case of the punctured torus , and , indeed , many results for toroidal topology had been obtained in the theory of dynamical systems[16],quantum billiards[92 ] and the conformal field theories[93 ] .",
    "nevertheless , even this case is still under detailed investigation as recent literature indicates[94 ] . in any event , by analogy with the circle , we shall utilize the  properties of the covering space which is just the infinite two dimensional lattice .",
    "we would like to construct explicitly the group representation which describe the motions on such lattice(s).fortunately , this has been done already so that we can use known results.moreover,these results will be useful also for the punctured torus case.since the torus t=@xmath554 and the case of s@xmath23 was studied in section 2 , we can begin our discussion by dissecting our torus so that it becomes a square(without loss of generality)with sides of unit length .",
    "then , the location of some point on the torus(or inside the square ) can be described in terms of the four real coordinates @xmath555 or , alternatively , in terms of two complex coordinates @xmath241 and @xmath56 such that @xmath556 since @xmath557 but eq.(7.8 ) is the equation for 3-sphere @xmath558 it can be proven[95](and the proof is not too difficult ) that all torus knots are obtained as result of intersection of the sphere s@xmath534 with the complex surface @xmath559 = 0 where p and q are relative primes so that p / q is some rational number.although all this is mathematically correct , we would like to provide intuitively more convincing picture of what is actually taking place .",
    "for this reason , we need to use the universal covering surface which is square lattice with the side length being 2@xmath117 .for construction of the trefoil knot , we need  to consider the basic rectangle with sides of length 4@xmath117 and 6@xmath117 respectively which can cover the entire complex plane by obvious translations .",
    "let us now draw the straight line from the point ( 0,0 ) to the point ( 4@xmath560 and let us by means of obvious translations bring the squares affected by this line to the initial square which corner is located at ( 0,0 ) .",
    "all this is depicted on fig.14 .",
    "now , the pattern in this initial square can be transferred back from the universal cover to the dissected torus without any change.actually,this pattern could be created directly in the base space too as depicted in fig.15 .",
    "this figure was  created with account of the periodic boundary conditions on the torus and , already from this picture one can recognize the knot projection if one properly resolves the intersections between the dashed and the solid lines(as it is always required in knot theory[43]).fig.15 allows us to reglue the square into the torus knowing that , indeed , the three dimensional knot is going to be created as result of such operation .",
    "this is depicted in fig.16 .        on this figure",
    "two trefoils are depicted : one is ( 3,2 ) and another is ( 2,3 ) which are , actually , the mirror images of each other and are called the right and  the left hand trefoils respectively[43 ] . now",
    ", what all this has to do with our original intentions?.for this , we have to talk about the analytical theory of toral automorphisms.it is clear , even without any actual calculations , that the figure 8 knot should be associated with the lines of irrational slope in the covering lattice , fig.14.such plausible reasoning would be to a large extent correct if we would forget the results of section 3 in which we had established that the universal covering space of the punctured torus is * not * a square lattice but rather the poincare upper half plane h@xmath561 this fact provides yet another evidence of profound distinction between the trefoil and figure 8 knots.the situation can be repaired somehow if we provide different interpretation of the results depicted in fig.14 .  to this purpose",
    "one needs to introduce the notion of the teichmller space of the punctured torus[96 ] . to make this concept readily comprehensible",
    "let us start with the notion of dehn twists.as it had been proven by nielsen[74 ] , following works of dehn[82],all selfhomeomorphisms of two dimensional surfaces can be performed with help of sequence of dehn twists .",
    "fig.17a depicts one of such twists , while fig.17b demonstrates what such twist can produce on the surface of a torus .",
    "this simple observation can now be broadly generalized . to do this",
    "several steps are required .",
    "to begin , let us consider , instead of a square lattice , fig.14,more general lattice , as depicted in fig.18 ,        which is characterized by the complex parameter @xmath562which is the ratio of periods @xmath563 and @xmath564 ( some relatively prime integers)along the respective axes ) so that , in accord with eq.(7.6 ) , the abelian group of translations @xmath565 can be described as @xmath566 surely , the difference between different tori lies in different values of @xmath567 let us reglue now the basic parallelogram in order to form torus with canonical marking , fig.18b . for the reference torus we can take ,",
    "say @xmath568now , if we change @xmath106 we thus going to form new torus which , evidently , * can not * be * isometrically * transformed to the old one .",
    "the relation between the new torus and the old one is established through @xmath569 with @xmath570 and @xmath571 being integers subject to constraint @xmath572.the group psl(2,z ) of the transformations just described is evidently the subgroup of psl(2,r ) introduced in section 3 and is known as * modular * group.since psl(2,r ) is the group of isometries of h@xmath303 , evidently , psl(2,z ) is also acting on h@xmath303 .",
    "the moduli space m = h@xmath573 for the torus , by definition , coincides with the fundamental domain , fig.19 ,        for the group psl(2,z ) as is well known[51 ] . the teichmller space is related to m but is more physically appealing as it will become clear momentarily.to this purpose , let us discuss the sequence of transformations as depicted in fig.18c and d.from this figure it is clear , that upon regluing of the deformed parallelogram the pattern of canonical markings , fig.18b , had undergone some changes and , in view of fig.17 , these changes could be interpreted in terms of the sequence of dehn twists made with respect to canonical markings.let us discuss an example of the trefoil knot .",
    "let we have originally the square lattice with sides of the basic square 1 and @xmath574 respectively . to construct a new lattice we use as a guide fig.18 .",
    "the fundamental paralleogram of new periods can be chosen according to the following set of equations written with respect to the  old  axes : @xmath575 where in eq.(7.12 ) we have to put @xmath576 and @xmath577 in order to obtain the trefoil knot .",
    "the numbers 3 and 2 are precisely the numbers of full twists with respect to canonical basis .",
    "in addition to eq.(7.12 ) we also have @xmath578 and @xmath579 the above two additional equations reflect the fact that the transformation leading from the original square to the final parallelogram are area - preserving which is insured by eq.(7.14 ) while eq.(7.13 ) comes as result of such constraint . with @xmath576 and @xmath577 eqs .",
    "( 7.14 ) produce the following set of solutions for @xmath162 and @xmath571:a)c=1,d=1 or b)c=-2 and d=-1.fig.s 20              demonstrate all this graphically .",
    "both solutions make sense for the following reasons .",
    "these solutions provide the number of dehn twists for the second basic curve involved in canonical marking .",
    "this second basic curve intersects the first one in just one point , fig.18b , initially and fig .",
    "18d , finally.but the amount of twisting of this second curve is related to the first one only by the law of area conservation so that in both cases we get the trefoil knot for the first basic curve.one can express all this in terms of vectors ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) which provide the numbers of dehn twists along  vertical ",
    "directions for the first and second canonical curves respectively.after this discussion it becomes clear that if we reglue the parallelograms in fig.20 and 21 , we reobtain respective toruses as depicted in fig.18d . evidently , if we * physically * relate the initial square to the final parallelogram(s ) we recognize that some stretching ( may be twisting also)was necessary in order to bring the square to the parallelogram before gluing .",
    "hence , the dehn twists are * always * associated with some stretching and twisting of the underlying surface .",
    "this fact is * directly * associated with the notion of the * teichmller space * since it is just the space of parameters responsible for surface deformations . in our case ,",
    "the driving parameter is @xmath106 so that the teicmller space is h@xmath303 for both torus and punctured torus[96 ] as it should become now intuitively clear based on the discussion we had just completed.finally , the sequence of dehn twists associated with selfhomeomorphisms(diffeomorphisms ) of torus(surface of genus g , in general ) causes some fundamental changes in the marking responsible for the fact that , for example , different torus knots are * isometrically * different.therefore , it is possible to associate the * mapping class * * group * , known also as * teichmller modular group * , with the group generated by all nontrivial ( that is not reducible to identity ) dehn twists ( associated with canonical marking ) so that the random walk problem of section 6 becomes the problem about the random walk on the mapping class group ( except , now we have to deal with random walks on groups which are not free).an excellent and readable description of the mapping class groups could be found in ref.[97 ] while good discussion of random walks on various groups which are not free could be found in ref[21].our first illustration of nontriviality of this group is the isometric difference between the tori depicted in figs.20 and 21 .",
    "let us discuss this topic a bit further since it has some applications to dynamics of liquid crystals and 2 + 1 quantum gravity as described in our earlier work , ref[17],(and , especially , appendix of this reference where connections of these dynamical problems with toral automorphisms ( in the simplest case)are discussed ) .",
    "if we select @xmath106 in the fundamental domain , fig.19 , i.e. in the moduli space m , then , it can be shown[51 ] , that different @xmath580 are * not * connected with each other by means of mbius - type transformation , eq.(7.11).but , once we picked some specific @xmath106 , then , this @xmath106 is connected with other @xmath581 which lies * outside * the moduli space via transformation of the type given by eq.(7.11 ) . by means of successive applications of transformation law eq.,(7.11 ) , one can reach all conjugate points in the corresponding hyperbolic triangles which tessellate h@xmath303 so that application of eq.(7.11 ) to all points of the moduli space will cover the entire h@xmath561 thus the teicmller modular group is acting on the moduli space .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show[51 ] that the arbitrary matrix @xmath582{cc}% a & b\\\\ c & d \\end{array } \\right )   = ts^{n_{1}}s^{n_{2}}t\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot s^{n_{k}}ts^{n_{l } } \\tag{7.15}%\\ ] ] where @xmath583{cc}% 1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right )   \\tag{7.16}%\\ ] ] and @xmath584{cc}% 0 & 1\\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{array } \\right )   \\tag{7.17}%\\ ] ] since @xmath585{cc}% -1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right )   \\tag{7.18}%\\ ] ] projectively , e.g.see eq.(7.11 ) , this explains why in expansion ( 7.15 ) all t s have the first power . the fundamental domain for psl(2,z ) in fig.19",
    "is depicted with  generators t and s in mind . as for the generator",
    "s , we had already encountered it , e.g.see eq.(3.6 ) .",
    "this means : a ) that the numbers n@xmath586n@xmath587 can be arbitrary integers and b ) that using eqs(7.15)-(7.17 ) we can always replace a -generator in eq.(3.6 ) with the appropriate sequence of t and s generators .",
    "moreover , the combination @xmath588 produces projectively @xmath589 so that , in view of eq.s(7.3 ) , ( 7.18 ) and ( 7.19 ) , we can consider the random walk on the complement of the trefoil using the generators of psl(2,z ) .",
    "this result is in accord with ref[81 ] where other arguments were used to reach the same conclusions . from the discussion",
    "we had just presented it is clear that the description of the toral automorphisms by means of the random walks on the mapping class group should be equivalent to traditionally used in the theory of dynamical systems [ 16].e.g.,for example , the torus mapping depicted in fig.20 could be equivalently described in terms of the map given by @xmath590@xmath591 and , of course , @xmath592 the above arguments ( x and y ) in this map should be taken mod1[16 ] by analogy with s@xmath23 case earlier discussed in section 2.for the case of toral automorphisms the use of teicmller space interpretation appears as plausible curiosity .",
    "the things change dramatically if the self homeomorphisms of surfaces of higher genus is of interest , e.g. in gravity or liquid crystals[17 ] . in mathematics literature ,",
    "the nielsen - thurston theory of surface selfhomeomorphisms is well developed[24,98 ] and , in view of the discussion already presented , can be used for description of various physical phenomena , including dynamics of liquid crystals and gravity .indeed , based on the results just obtained the toral selfhomeomorphisms could be of three types : a)*reducible*,when the words like that in eq.(7.15 ) are of finite length ( this corresponds to finite continued fraction expansion , eq.(7.5));b)**periodic(**which may correspond to the periodic continued fraction of some quadratic irrationals)and , c)*irreducible * ( or anosov ( pseudo anosov in more general case))which may be associated with truly irrational continued fraction expansions .",
    "the first possibility in the language of liquid crystals[99 ] corresponds to solid phase , the second to the hexatic phase and the third to the liquid phase . for more details ,",
    "please , consult our earlier work , ref[17 ] .",
    "connections between theory of dynamical systems and theory of  knots and links are the most naturally described in terms of the nielsen - thurston theory[98 ] and , although this field  is still under active development even in mathematics[100 ] , we would like to provide here a sketch of what one may expect upon development of such connections.this information may be useful in fields ranging from gravity through liquid crystals , dynamics of fracture and even folding of proteins(for references related to these problems , please , consult our earlier work , ref[17 ] ) .    description of dynamical systems in terms of lyapunov exponents , fractal and multifractal dimensions , entropy , etc is well known[101 ] .",
    "recently , however , more and more emphasis is being made on connections between dynamical systems and the theory of knots and links[102 ] .",
    "the complements of knots and links are 3-manifolds and , moreover , there are 3- manifolds which are not related to links /knots",
    ", especially those which are not compact.the 3-manifolds arise completely naturally in the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "to realize this fact it is sufficient just to take a look again at fig.15 .",
    "extension this picture to a cube with periodic boundary condition creates already our first 3 manifold , i.e. cube with the opposite sides properly identified .",
    "this example already provides a clue as to how 3-manifolds can be constructed : e.g. take some polyhedron and identify the opposite sides in some systematic way . as a result of such an identification",
    "we again obtain some 3-manifold .",
    "since some of these 3 manifolds are related to knots it is interesting to know that , for example , fig.8 knot complement , which is also a 3-manifold , can be obtained by proper gluing of faces of two ideal tetrahedra to each other .",
    "this and other very beautiful  illustrations of making 3-manifolds associated with simple knots / links could be found in ref.[103 ] . in case of trefoil , the associated 3-manifold is a ( 3.2 ) lens space .",
    "it is easily created out of two * solid * toruses.to do so we should have one torus with standard canonical marking being glued to other ( twisted ) torus which contains the trefoil knot on its surface so that the initial ( canonical ) marking is glued to the final marking and then the rest of two torus surfaces being glued to each other [ 104 ] .",
    "this example gives an idea about the way 3-manifolds are related to surface dynamics.let us now be more specific .",
    "let @xmath593 be some surface and let x@xmath594 .consider a homeomorphism @xmath595 .",
    "imagine now that this homeomorphism takes place in stages , i.e.evolvs in time so that at time t=0 @xmath596 while at time 1 @xmath597 may or may not coincide with x @xmath598 the time 1 is , of course , quite arbitrary and is chosen for convenience only.let us now identify ( x,0 ) with ( @xmath599 @xmath598this identification leads us to a  3-manifold t@xmath600 .",
    "this 3-manifold is a fiber bundle with fiber s , base s@xmath601a circle ) and monodromy @xmath602 .",
    "it is clear that the monodromy @xmath602 is directly related to the random walk on the teichmller modular group ( as described in the previous subsection).it is clear also that different surface dynamics will lead to different 3-manifolds in general so that the topology and geometry of 3-manifolds is yet another way of description of dynamical systems[100,102 ] .",
    "the above picture can be elaborated now as follows.since there is one - to - one correspondence between the sequence of dehn twists and the sequence of words being regulated by the continued fractions expansions it is clear that the trivial fiber bundle can be associated with the * reducible * selfhomeomorphisms and that the * periodic * selfhomeomorphisms produce naturally 3-manifolds known also as seifert fibered spaces[81,84,104 ] .",
    "surely , all torus knots are associated with periodic selfhomeomorphims and , therefore are in one- to - one correspondence with sefert fibered spaces as was already established by sefert in 1933(the sufficiently simple proof of this could be found in chr.6 of ref.[81]).what is much less clear why the above construction of 3-manifolds should be also applicable to * * irreducible ( * * or pseudo anosov * * ) * * selfhomeomorphisms .",
    "the fact that this is actually possible had been proven rather recently [ 100].and , the most remarkable fact of this proof lies in use of feigenbaum - cvitanovich results for one dimensional maps which , in the light of the results we had presented already should not be totally unexpected .",
    "3-manifolds associated with knots such as figure 8 are hyperbolic . so that all knots other than torus knots should be associated with hyperbolic 3-manifolds . that this is indeed the case had been proven by thurston[86,103 ] and was mentioned already in our earlier work , ref[14 ] .",
    "the hyperbolicity of knots is directly connected with transience of random walks in the presence of such knots as we had already discussed in section 7.a .",
    "moreover , using the results of hyperbolic geometry it is possible to get  information about fractal dimensions of the limits sets ( in case of dynamical interpretation ) . some introduction to this subject can be found in our earlier work , ref.[105 ] .",
    "[ [ schottky - doubles - markov - triples - and - grothendiecks - dessins - denfants ] ] schottky doubles , markov triples  and grothendieck s dessins denfants ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    although we had covered many aspects of the figure 8 story , there are many topics which we had not mentioned at all so far . in this subsection we would like to correct this deficiency .",
    "evidently , our presentation is going to be brief but , since the topics to be discussed are directly and logically related to the rest of this paper , it is impossible not to mention about them",
    ".    let us begin with the notion of schottky double.from the discussion we had so far it is clear that treatment of boundaries in the hyperbolic geometry is not as simple as it is in euclidean case .",
    "for instance , suppose we would like to calculate the spectrum of laplacian on the punctured torus",
    ".the question immediately arises : how the spectrum of laplacian will depend upon the boundary conditions at the puncture ? to some extent this problem was solved by gutzwiller[85 ] who however admits , e.g .",
    "see page 376 of ref.[85 ] , that more systematic mathematical treatment is given in the monograph by lax and phillips[106 ] .",
    "surprisingly , the case is still not closed as recent annals of mathematics paper [ 87 ] indicates .",
    "hence , it would be too naive to address this problem in its full generality in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to mention one simple case which has its familiar analogue , for example , in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the idea belongs to schottky and is described in ref.[96].consider a riemann surface r  with punctures and its copy r obtained by reflecting r in the mirror .",
    "given these two copies , glue them along the boundaries of punctures .",
    "thus obtained new riemann surface is known as schottky double . in the case of punctured torus",
    "the schottky double is a double torus which , not surprisingly , was also considered by gutzwiller[85 ] . such construction is equivalent of having perfectly reflecting boundary conditions in standard quantum mechanics and also has some applications to polymer solutions in confined geometries[14 ] , etc.the boundary conditions(that is the existence of puncture ) , as pointed by gutzwiller [ 85 ] and known from the theory of riemann surfaces[107 ] , could be modelled by imposing certain constraints on the commutator @xmath548 defined before eq.(7.6).in particular , one can require @xmath603 ( where @xmath604 is  transformation of the type given by eq.(7.11 ) ) to be * parabolic * , that is tr(@xmath604)=2 .",
    "such requirement provides one constraint on the explicit form of matrices @xmath156 and @xmath161.additional constraints could be imposed by locating vertices of the hyperbolic triangle at points 0 , 1 and @xmath296 as depicted in fig.2 , or hyperbolic quadrangle at points -1,0,1 and + @xmath296 , as depicted in fig.3 .",
    "let us check this result explicitly.using results of section 3 we obtain , @xmath605@xmath606 accordingly , @xmath607 and @xmath608 using eqs.(7.22)-(7.25 ) in ( 7.21 ) a short computation produces @xmath609 from here , tr(@xmath610=2 as required .",
    "the above simple calculation teaches us some very important lessons.first , since we are dealing with projective transformations , e.g. that given by eq.(7.11 ) , we can always normalize our matrices the way which is the most convenient for us . in particular , already in more than hundred years ago fricke[108 ] had shown that for any unimodular matrices a and b @xmath611 where , as before,@xmath548 is the commutator of a and b. now , let tr@xmath6122.this is quite permissible in view of eq.(7.26 ) since multiplication by -1 of both numerator and denominator changes nothing(e.g.see eq.(7.18)).such normalization however , makes a difference in eq.(7.27 ) which now could be brought to form @xmath613 where c= ( ab)@xmath614 and the fact that tr(d)=tr(d@xmath615 for any unimodular matrix d was used.by setting @xmath616=3@xmath617=3@xmath618 and @xmath619=3@xmath620 we obtain , instead of eq.(7.28),the following equation for the * * markov triples[**25 * ] * @xmath621 with @xmath622 being nonnegative integers.by looking at this equation we immediately recognize that it is trivially satisfied by @xmath623 this information , when combined with the requirement of unimodularity , is sufficient for restoring the explicit form of matrices a and b , and , hence , ab . questions arise : a)are there other solutions to the equation for markov triples and b ) what is their physical significance if they indeed exist ?",
    "the answer to the first question is known in mathematical literature and will be discussed shortly below .",
    "the answer to the second question could be related to the fractional quantum hall effect . indeed ,",
    "if solutions other than trivial to eq.(7.29 ) do exist , , then , based on the results of sections 3 and 4 , we conclude that they may be associated with different shapes of the fundamental domains in h@xmath303 plane and , accordingly , to different locations of punctures in s@xmath561thus if the punctures are associated with anyons , then , evidently , their mutual position can not be arbitrary so that we have some sort of solid phase in the * cluster approximation * ( made of 3 punctures ) . within this approximation the filling fraction[14 ] ,",
    "0@xmath331@xmath624 can be calculated and , because the pattern or markov triples is very intricate ( see discussion below ) one obtains a very rich array of the permissible filling fractions characteristic for the fractional quantum hall effect[109].to what extent such cluster picture can be extended to more than 3 punctures is related to the works of grotendieck on dessin denfants[22 ] to be also discussed below .    looking at eq.(7.29 )",
    "it is clear that there is a complete symmetry between @xmath625 and @xmath626 this symmetry can be broken if we notice that ( 2,1,1 ) is also solution to eq.(7.29 ) .",
    "this  solution is called _",
    "singular_[25].it could be shown , that this is the only solution for which 2 out of three markov numbers are the same .",
    "all other solutions have distinct markov numbers.to generate these other solutions ( markov triples ) it is sufficient to have a  seed   in the form ( @xmath627 which , by definition , obeys markov equation , eq.(7.29 ) .",
    "then , the first generation of new markov triples given by @xmath628 where @xmath629 .if  one starts with ( 1,1,1 ) then , the markov tree ( its part of course ) is depicted in fig.22 .        the emergence of numbers @xmath630 , etc . , can be easily understood if we consider , instead of eq.(7.29 ) , its equivalent form given by @xmath631 evidently , @xmath632 for @xmath633 and @xmath634 additional information about markov triples could be found in refs.[110 - 112 ] .",
    "now the question arises as to what extent one can generalize these results to more than tree punctures .",
    "there are several ways to proceed .",
    "for example , prior to theorem 7.1 .",
    "we ve noticed that it is sufficient to make one puncture ( hole ) in surface of any genus g in order to obtain a free group with 2 g generators .",
    "by analogy with eq.(7.29 ) , one may think of solutions of equation @xmath635 as it was done by hurwitz[113 ] and elaborated  by hirzebruch and zagier[114 ] .",
    "there is , however , much more striking approach to the whole problem .",
    "it was proposed by grotendieck [ 22 ]  and was elaborated by belyi[115 ] and others[22].these mathematical results had found already their place in physics literature in connection with problems related to discretized string theory[22 ] and the theory of polygonal billiards[116].as it was argued above , these results could be potentially useful in the theory of fractional hall effect and/or quantum chaos , etc .    the idea of the grotendieck approach is rather simple .",
    "take for example the torus case .",
    "the torus , fig.18a(or 18b ) can be made out of two triangles and , accordingly , any riemann surface of genus g also can be triangulated .",
    "such triangulation of arbitrary closed riemann surface could be easily understood if we would consider the motion of ficticious particle in a triangular billiard whose angles are some rational fractions of @xmath636 instead of watching the complicated trajectory inside the triangle it is much better to unfold the trajectory in a way shown in fig.23 .",
    "such unfolded trajectory is just a straight line , just as in the case of a torus , fig .",
    "14 . from the covering surface , e.g. that depicted in fig.14 , one needs now to restore the corresponding ( riemann ) surface .",
    "this was done initially by richens and berry[117 ] and was subsequently generalized and elaborated by zemlyakov and katok[118 ] and many others , e.g.seeref.[119 ] . strictly speaking ,",
    "to triangulate riemann surface one needs to consider such triangle groups whose action on the fundamental domain for such groups will cover ( tessellate ) given riemann surface without gaps or overlaps .",
    "grotendieck calls such groups  cartographic groups  .",
    "a good survey of the cartographic groups is given in ref.[22].the triangulation of riemann surfaces is not a new idea.the new idea lies in utilizing the results for the trice punctured sphere , sections 3 - 4 , in order to achieve the triangulation of riemann surface of * any * genus.the dessins denfants ( the drawings of  children ) problem is directly related to the triangulation problem and can be formulated as problem of drawing an arbitrary(but pre assigned ) closed graph on riemann surface .",
    "this happens to be not a simple task .to make a connection between the trice punctured sphere and some riemann  surface one needs to have a mapping function which connects the triangulation on the riemann surface with triangles on the sphere.this function had been constructed explicitly by belyi[115 ] .",
    "we follow , however , the work of shabat and voevodsky[120 ] in order to illustrate the basic idea of the method .",
    "if the surface is orientable , it is possible to color the adjacent triangles in two different colors , say , black and white . given such coloring , one can distinguish three types of vertices : @xmath236 , @xmath637 and @xmath638let the red arrow connect @xmath236 and@xmath639 , let also the black arrow connect @xmath639 with @xmath637 and , finally , let the blue arrow connect @xmath637 with @xmath236 .let us next associate the vertex @xmath236 with number 0 , @xmath639 with 1 and @xmath637 with @xmath296 .",
    "the above numbers are associated with the location of punctures on s@xmath303 for the trice punctured sphere as discussed in sections 3 and 4.to understand the connection , observation of fig.24a is helpful at this time .",
    "let us select two adjacent triangles which , by construction , are colored differently , e.g. see fig.24b . finally , if we glue together these triangles along the free edges , thus obtained object is just a trice punctured sphere.this can be easily understood if we imagine that the triangles are made of rubber and we blow up air through one of the open holes and then close it . hence , to get a triangulation of an arbitrary riemann surface @xmath640 , one shoold only look for",
    "the appropriate branched covering with branches over the points 0 , 1 and @xmath641 clearly , for each point , say , 0 on s@xmath448 there is a finite number of the corresponding points on @xmath640 , etc . the mapping function @xmath642 which actually maps s@xmath643 to @xmath640 is given by @xmath644 with m , n being some integers which value depends upon the genus of @xmath640 .    from this discussion",
    "it is clear that thus obtained markov triples could  be now used for an arbitrary @xmath640 and this fact then proves their relevance for computation of the multitude of the filling fractions @xmath645 characteristic for the factional hall effect[109 ] . to complete our discussion",
    ", we have to consider still one more topic .",
    "we include this subsection in this paper in order to emphasize some aspects of theory of braids which are directly related to the discussion we had so far .",
    "we assume , that the reader is familiar with some basic concepts of the theory of braids [ 81].the braid group is infinite group of n-1 generators @xmath646 obeying the following set of defining equations(in the planar case only ) @xmath647 and @xmath648 as it was shown already by artin(inventor of the braid group ) [ 121 ] , the braid group can actually be generated just by its two elements @xmath649 and @xmath650 thus , @xmath651 and @xmath652 in particular , let n=3,then , instead of eqs(7.35 ) , we get @xmath653 accordingly , @xmath654 and , using eq.(7.40 ) , it is convenient to introduce yet another generator @xmath655 then , eq.(7.39 ) is reduced to @xmath656 thus , we had obtained back the presentation group for the trefoil given earlier by eq.(7.3 ) . @xmath657",
    "introduced in eq.(7.39 ) , has some physical meaning . if we would have a trivial braid made of n strands , then application of @xmath658  to such trivial braid amounts of full rotation of the lover side of the frame while keeping the upper side fixed[81 ] .",
    "therefore , if the system , say , is * not * rotationally invariant , one can not use the concept of braids while the concept of fundamental group of free generators still survives .",
    "the connections between braids and free groups could be made more explicit if needed .",
    "here we would like only to touch upon the most immediate connections .",
    "to this purpose we need to introduce the notion of * colored * braid . basically , the braid is colored if the end of each strand lies exactly over its beginning ( that is for the ordered sequence on the bottom frame there is exactly the same ordered sequence on the top ) . from this definition ,",
    "we notice that colored braids correspond to the * distinguishable * particles in physics terminology . for the colored braids",
    "p@xmath659 made of n strands , connection with free groups becomes very direct .",
    "25              illustrates how the colored braid p@xmath661 could be made out of composition of braids made with help of the generators of the free groups @xmath662 and @xmath663 for general n mathematically , such braid can be written as semidirect product @xmath664 for the colorless case , one can analyze the connections further by using eq.s(7.36)-(7.39 ) ."
