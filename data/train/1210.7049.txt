    "in this work , we consider the scattering of photons by the gravitational field of a non - rotating , finite - sized body .",
    "such finite - sized bodies have radius @xmath0 that slightly exceeds their schwarzschild radius @xmath3 .",
    "we show that low - energy photon scattering from such objects resembles black hole absorption .",
    "the absorption arises due to the existence of a dense spectrum of narrow resonances ( meta - stable states ) whose lifetime and density tend to infinity in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "photons captured to such a resonant state are trapped on the interior of the body for a time @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the width of a given resonance . for @xmath2 ,",
    "both the energy spacing @xmath6 and width @xmath5 tend to zero ( resonance lifetime @xmath7 ) , while their ratio remains finite .",
    "this allows us to define the total cross - section for particle capture into these long - lived states using the optical model  @xcite , which is calculated by averaging over a small energy interval containing many resonances . at low energy",
    "the resonance capture cross - section is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy of the incident particle .",
    "the absence of a longitudinal mode for photons means there is no state with total angular momentum equal to zero , hence the above cross - section tending to zero for zero energy .",
    "this cross - section exactly matches the absorption cross - section for a schwarzschild black hole calculated by assuming complete absorption at the event horizon ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) derived previously for massless spin-1 particles  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that our calculation does not impose any special conditions at the boundary .",
    "thus by considering the purely elastic cross - section of low - energy incident photons , we find that the absorption properties of a body with @xmath10 resemble those of a black hole .    the gravitational field of these near - black - hole objects is described using a suitable metric to model the interior , which is then joined to the standard schwarzschild exterior metric at the boundary of the body .",
    "the above result is shown to be valid for any interior metric satisfying the following conditions : continuity with the schwarzschild exterior at @xmath11 , a potential that deepens and develops a singularity in the black hole limit ( allowing the particle to be treated semi - classically ) and that this potential can be modeled as a harmonic oscillator in some finite region around the origin .",
    "we expect these conditions to be met by a large class of metrics ; in this paper we present two metrics for which these conditions hold .",
    "additionally , the results presented include the spin-0 ( scalar ) case considered previously ( for @xmath12 ) @xcite , but given here for arbitrary angular momentum @xmath13 . in this case taking @xmath2 once again yields the black hole absorption cross - section given in @xcite .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of previous calculations involving scattering of various particles in the black hole spacetime we turn the readers attention to the introductions in @xcite and references therein . as in previous work @xcite",
    "we perform both analytical and numerical calculations , with good agreement between the two .",

    "one may write a general static , spherically symmetric metric in the form @xmath19 by applying the separation of variables @xmath20 to ( [ kg_massless ] ) and ( [ maxwell_eqns ] ) respectively in the metric ( [ general_metric ] ) , one arrives at the radial differential equations for spin-0 and spin-1 respectively . in the latter",

    "this solution is valid under certain constraints placed on the metric coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the specific metrics considered in later sections are entirely consistent with the restrictions imposed .",
    "it is worth noting that in the s - wave scalar case @xmath31 there is only one interior region akin to the one defined in sec .",
    "( [ sec : r2i ] ) , albeit with different constraints . as such ,",
    "this case is not treated here and we instead refer the reader to our previous treatment of this case in @xcite . for the purposes of the discussion below we note that for the interior metric of near - black - hole object , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , as time slows down in the limit @xmath2 .      in the vicinity of the origin spacetime , and indeed the potential , must be locally flat .",
