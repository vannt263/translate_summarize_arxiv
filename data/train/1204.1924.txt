    "the conventional assumption made in the design of communication systems is that the energy used to transfer information between a sender and a recipient can not be reused for future communication tasks .",
    "a notable exception to this norm is given by passive rfid systems , in which a reader can transfer both information and energy via the transmitted radio signal . upon reception of the radio signal from the reader , a passive rfid tag modulates information by backscattering the radio energy received from the reader ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another , less conventional , example is that of a biological system in which information is exchanged via the transmission of particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which can be later reused for successive communication tasks .",
    "more in general , any system that exchanges information via the transfer of given physical resources ( radio waves , particles , qubits ) can conceivably reuse , at least part , of the received resources for later communication tasks .",
    "this paper is motivated by the examples above to consider a two - way communication system @xcite that operates with a given initial number of physical resources , which we will refer to as energy units ( see fig .",
    "[ figsysmodel ] ) .",
    "the energy units are not replenished from outside the system and can only decrease with time . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "assume that the two parties involved have a common clock and that , at each time , a node can either send an `` on '' symbol ( or `` 1 '' ) , which costs one unit of energy , or an `` off '' signal ( or `` 0 '' ) , which does not require any energy expenditure .",
    "upon reception of a `` 1 '' signal , the recipient node `` harvests '' the energy contained in the signal and stores it for future communication tasks . in general , such harvesting process can incur an energy loss .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that the binary channel in either direction is noiseless .",
    "clearly , if there were no limitation on the number of energy units , the nodes could communicate 1 bit per channel use in either direction given that the channels are ideal .",
    "however , consider now the case with a single energy unit available in the system .",
    "moreover , assume that there are no energy losses so that when a `` 1 '' is received , one energy unit is retrieved at the recipient .",
    "then , at any time instant , the energy unit is available at either node 1 or at node 2 .",
    "it follows that only the node that currently possesses the energy unit can transmit a `` 1 '' , whereas the other node is forced to transmit a `` 0 '' .",
    "therefore , the design of the communication strategy at the nodes should aim not only at transferring the most information to the counterpart , but also to facilitate energy transfer . due to the constraints on the available physical resources for transmission",
    ", it is expected that the maximum sum - rate of two , achievable with no energy limitations , can not be attained with a limited number of energy units .",
    "it is this trade - off that we are interested in studying in this paper .      in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the simple two - way binary noiseless model illustrated above and assume that the initial number of energy units is given , and can be transferred as discussed above upon transmission of a `` 1 '' symbol .",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that there are no energy losses in the system and investigate the set of rate pairs achievable for any given number of energy units .",
    "specifically , inner and outer bounds on the achievable rates are derived , and shown via numerical results to coincide if the number of energy units is large enough .",
    "a few additional remarks are in order .",
    "the model that we consider here is different from a conventional setting in which a conventional total average cost constraint is imposed on the two nodes ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a cost constraint does not entail any memory in the system , whereas , in the set - up at hand of information exchange , the current transmissions affect the available energy in the next time instants .",
    "the model is more related to recent works that analyze communication in the presence of energy harvesting ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . however , in those works , one assumes that the energy is harvested from the environment in a way that is not affected by the communication process . instead , here",
    ", the energy available at a node depends on the previous actions of all other nodes involved in the communication process .",

    "capital letters denote random variables and the corresponding lowercase quantities denote specific values of the random variables .",

    "the channel is noiseless so that the received signals at channel use @xmath9 are given by @xmath25 for node 1 and node 2 , respectively .",
    "transmission of a `` 1 '' transfers one energy unit from the sender node to the recipient node .",

    "we observe that the current state @xmath17 is a deterministic function of the number @xmath28 of total energy units , of the initial state @xmath29 and of the previously transmitted signals @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "we use the following definitions for an @xmath37 code .",
    "specifically , the code is defined by : the overall number of energy units @xmath28 ; two sequences of encoding functions , namely , for node 1 , we have functions @xmath38 for @xmath10 $ ] , which map the message @xmath32 and the past received symbols @xmath39 ( along with the initial state ) into the currently transmitted signal @xmath40 ; similarly , for node 2 , we have functions @xmath41 for @xmath10 $ ] , which map the message @xmath42 and the past received symbols @xmath43 ( along with the initial state ) into the currently transmitted signal @xmath44 ; and two decoding functions , namely , for node 1 , we have a function @xmath45 , which maps all received signals @xmath46 and the local message @xmath32 into an estimate @xmath47 of message @xmath42 ; and similarly , for node 2 , we have a function @xmath48 , which maps all received signals @xmath49 and the local message @xmath42 into an estimate @xmath47 of message @xmath32 .",
    "we require that the estimated messages be equal to the true messages given the noiseless nature of the channel for any initial state @xmath27 .",
    "we say that rates ( @xmath50 ) are achievable with @xmath28 energy units if there exists an @xmath37 code for all sufficiently large @xmath51 .",
    "we are interested in studying the closure of the set of all the rate pairs @xmath52 that are achievable with @xmath28 energy units , which we refer to as capacity region @xmath53 .",
    "in this section , we consider various communication strategies .",
    "we start by the simplest , but intuitively important , case with ` u`@xmath54 , and we then generalize to ` u`@xmath55 .",
    "we start with the special case of one energy unit ( @xmath56 ) and assume the initial state @xmath57 , so that the energy unit is initially available at node 1 .",
    "the other case , namely @xmath58 , can be treated in a symmetric way . in this setting , during each channel use , `` information '' can be transferred only from the node where the energy unit resides towards the other node , and not vice versa , since the other node is forced to transmits the `` 0 '' symbol .",
    "this suggests that , when @xmath56 , the channel is necessarily used in a time - sharing manner , and thus the sum - rate is at most one bit per channel use .",
    "the first question is whether the sum - rate of 1 bit / c.u . is achievable , and , if so , which strategy accomplishes this task .",
    "we start with a rather nave encoding strategy that turns out to be insufficient to achieve the upper bound of 1 bit / c.u .. the nodes agree on a frame size @xmath59 channel uses for some integer @xmath60 and partition the @xmath51 channel uses in @xmath61 frames ( assumed to be an integer for simplicity ) .",
    "the node that has the energy unit at the beginning of the frame communicates @xmath62 bits to the other node by placing the energy unit in one specific channel use among the @xmath63 of the frame .",
    "this process also transfers the energy unit to the other node , and the procedure is repeated .",
    "the sum - rate achieved by this scheme is @xmath64},\\ ] ] which is rather inefficient : the maximum is achieved with @xmath65 , leading to a sum - rate of @xmath66 bits/ c.u ..    the previous strategy can be easily improved by noting that the frame can be interrupted after the channel use in which the energy unit is used , since the receiving node can still decode the transmitted @xmath60 bits .",
    "this strategy corresponds to using a variable - length channel code .",
    "specifically , we can assign , without loss of optimality within this class of strategies , the codeword `` 01 '' to information bit `` 0 '' and the codeword `` 1 '' to bit `` 1 '' .",
    "the average number of channel uses per bit is thus @xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the overall number of channel uses necessary for the transmission of @xmath69 bits is upper bounded by @xmath70 with arbitrarily small probability for large @xmath69 by the weak law of large numbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that an achievable sum - rate is given by @xmath71 which is still lower than the upper bound of 1 bit / c.u ..      we now discuss a strategy that achieves the upper bound of @xmath72 bit / c.u .. the procedure is based on time - sharing , as driven by the transfer of the energy unit from one to the other node . specifically , each node @xmath14 has @xmath69 bits of information @xmath73 .",
    "since the initial state is @xmath57 , node 1 is the first to transmit : it sends its information bits , starting with @xmath74 up until the first bit that equals `` 1 '' .",
    "specifically , assume that we have @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath77th channel use the energy unit is transferred to node 2 . from the @xmath78th channel use , node 2",
    "then starts sending its first bit @xmath79 and the following bits until the first bit equal to `` 1 '' .",
    "the process is then repeated .",
    "it is easy to see that the total time required to finalize this two - way communication is constant and equal to @xmath80 and thus the achieved sum - rate is equal to @xmath81 bit / c.u ..      in the sum - capacity strategy discussed above with @xmath83 energy unit , both nodes transmit equiprobable symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' .",
    "when there are @xmath84 energy units in the system , maximizing the sum - capacity generally requires a different approach .",
    "consider the scenario with @xmath85 energy units : now it can happen that both energy units are available at one node , say node 1 . while node 1 would prefer to transmit equiprobable symbols `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' in order to maximize the _ information _ flow to the recipient , one must now also consider the _ energy _ flow : privileging transmission of a `` 1 '' over that of a `` 0 '' makes it possible to transfer energy to node 2 , leading to a state in which both nodes have energy for the next channel use .",
    "this might be beneficial in terms of achievable sum - rate .",
    "based on this insight , in the following , we propose a coding strategy that employs rate splitting and codebook multiplexing .",
    "the strategy is a natural extension of the baseline approach discussed above for the case @xmath56 .",
    "each node @xmath14 constructs @xmath28 codebooks , namely @xmath86 , with @xmath87 $ ] , where codebook @xmath86 is to be used when the node @xmath14 has @xmath88 energy units .",
    "each codebook @xmath86 is composed of codewords that all have a specific fraction @xmath89 of `` 1 '' symbols .",
    "the main idea is that , when the number @xmath88 of available energy units is large , one might prefer to use a codebook with a larger fraction @xmath89 of `` 1 '' symbols in order to facilitate energy transfer .    [ prop : achievable ] the rate pair @xmath52 satisfying @xmath90 for some probabilities @xmath91 , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , is included in the capacity region @xmath53 , where the probabilities @xmath94 satisfy the fixed - point equations @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and we have defined @xmath98    this proposition is proved by resorting to random coding arguments , whereby codebook @xmath86 is generated with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) @xmath99 .",
    "as introduced above , the idea is that , when the state is @xmath100 , node @xmath14 transmits a symbol from the codebook associated with that state , namely codebook @xmath101 for node @xmath72 and codebook @xmath102 for node 2 ( which has @xmath103 energy units ) .",
    "both nodes know the current state @xmath17 and thus can demultiplex the codebooks at the receiver side . according to the random coding argument",
    ", the state @xmath17 evolves according to a markov chain : the system stays in the same state @xmath88 with probability @xmath104 ( both nodes transmit `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' ) , changes to the state @xmath105 with probability @xmath106 ( node 1 transmits a `` 1 '' and node 2 a `` 0 '' ) or changes to the state @xmath107 with probability @xmath108 ( node 1 transmits a `` 0 '' and node 2 a `` 1 '' ) .",
    "the definition of the conditional probabilities ( [ eq : trans_prob ] ) reflects the fact that the codebooks are generated independently by the two nodes . a full proof is given in appendix  [ sec : proofprop1 ] .",
    "in this section , we derive an outer bound to the capacity region @xmath53 . to set up the notation , for a given joint distribution @xmath109 , conditional on some value @xmath88 , with @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    ", we define the marginal distributions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the conditional distributions @xmath114 and @xmath115 , for @xmath110 .",
    "if the rate pair ( @xmath50 ) is included in the capacity region @xmath53 , then there exist probabilities @xmath116 with @xmath97 , and @xmath111 for all @xmath117 , such that @xmath118 for @xmath119 , @xmath120 for @xmath121 , condition ( [ eq : markovchaintransitions ] ) is satisfied , and the following inequalities hold @xmath122    the outer bound above can be interpreted as follows .",
    "suppose that , when the state is @xmath100 , the nodes were allowed to choose their transmitted symbols according to a _",
    "distribution @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "note that this is unlike the achievable strategy described in the previous section in which the codebook were generated independently .",
    "intuitively , allowing for correlated codebooks , leads to a larger achievable rate region , as formalized by proposition 2 , whose proof can be found in appendix b.",
    "[ fig : num_results ] compares the achievable sum - rate obtained from proposition 1 and the upper bound ( [ eq : sum_rate_upper ] ) on the sum - rate obtained from proposition 2 versus the total number of energy units @xmath28 . as for the achievable sum - rate",
    ", we consider both a conventional codebook design in which the same probability @xmath124 is used irrespective of the state @xmath125 , and one in which the probabilities @xmath126 are optimized .",
    "it can be seen that using conventional codebooks , which only aim at maximizing information flow on a single link , leads to substantial performance loss . instead , the proposed strategy with optimized probabilities @xmath127 , which account also for the need to manage the energy flow in the two - way communication system , performs close to the upper bound .",
    "the latter is indeed achieved when @xmath28 is large enough .    a remark on the optimal probabilities @xmath127 is in order . due to symmetry",
    ", it can be seen that we have @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , numerical results show that @xmath129 increases monotonically as @xmath88 goes from @xmath130 to ` u ` , such that @xmath131 .",
    "in particular , when the number of states @xmath132 is odd , it holds that @xmath133 .",

    "in resource - constrained systems in which the resources ( e.g. , energy ) used for communication can be `` recycled '' , new performance trade - offs arise due the need to balance the maximization of the information flow with the resulting resource exchange among the communicating nodes .",
