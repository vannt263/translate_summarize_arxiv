    "massive stars explosively end their life in a core collapse supernova ( cc sn ) .",
    "few solid facts are known about sn progenitors .",
    "hydrogen - rich type ii sne ( and in particular , type ii - p ) are firmly associated with red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitors , while rare underluminous sne ii ( e.g. , sn 1987a ) may arise from blue superiants ( bsg ) .",
    "other classes of core - collapse sne that are depleted in hydrogen ( e.g. , types ib , ic ) probably arise from stripped stars , such as wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars , but the exact mapping is unknown ; see filippenko ( 1997 ) and smartt ( 2009 ) for reviews of sn types and progenitors , respectively .",
    "the final stages of massive star evolution and the physics of the explosion are also poorly understood , see , e.g. , langer ( 2012 ) and references therein .",
    "although there are numerous sn detections every year ( gal - yam et al .",
    "2013 ) , most events are discovered a long time ( days ) after the explosion of the star .",
    "this delay is unfortunate since radiation emitted during the first few days after sn explosion is governed by relatively simple physics : recombination and line opacity are negligible and in most cases so is radioactivity .",
    "this early emission encodes crucial information about the outer envelope of the exploding star ( approximately its outer @xmath7m@xmath0 ) that can be extracted from robust and simple models . exploring this outer shell mass",
    "is very interesting as it is it that determines the stellar radius and outer density profile of the star , and its properties can be used to study currently poorly - known stellar physics such as the mixing length and convection parameters .",
    "observations starting only after this early period thus result in loss of this information about the supernova progenitor star and the explosion mechanism itself .",
    "only a handful of events were detected during this early phase ( e.g. arnett et al .",
    "1989 ; schmidt et al . 1993 ; campana et al . 2006 ; soderberg et al . 2008 ; gezari et al .",

    "2008 ; arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ; cao et al . 2013 ; gal - yam et al . 2011 ; 2014 ) , and even in these cases the time resolution of the measurements is generally too poor to form a well - sampled light curve .",
    "an early detection of the sn and a measurement of its light curve are useful to understand the physics of the explosion itself , and its progenitor properties .",
    "the first light escaping from an exploding star emerges as a shock breakout flare , with a hot spectrum peaking in the ultra - violet ( uv ) or x - ray bands . models for this shock breakout emission have a long history ( e.g. , colgate 1974 ; grassberg et al .",
    "1971 ; falk 1978 ; klein & chevalier 1978 ; ensman & burrows 1992 , matzner & mckee 1999 ) . in recent years several theoretical models were developed in order to describe emerging observations of the explosion shock breakout ( e.g. , nakar & sari 2010 ; sapir et al .",

    "[ sbscfig ] shows that exact analytic and numerical solutions by sapir et al .",
    "( 2013 ) are in general agreement with analytic models by nakar & sari ( 2010 ) after appropriate rescaling of the latter .",
    "however , only a single such flare has been serendipitously observed ( soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) and the relevant theory is virtually untested . if detected , shock breakout flares provide a direct measure of the pre - explosion stellar radius r@xmath8 : the flare duration scales as r@xmath8/c , and the integrated luminosity as r@xmath9 ( klein & chevalier 1978 ; katz et al .",
    "2012 ) .    following an initial shock breakout flare ( i.e. , at times @xmath10h post - explosion )",
    ", the expanding stellar envelope emits a fraction of the leftover stored explosion energy during the shock cooling phase , initially peaking in the uv .",
    "this phase is better understood theoretically ( e.g. , grassberg et al .",
    "1971 ; chevalier 1976 , 1992 ; chevalier & frensson 1998 ) and has been observed in a few cases ( by galex , schawinski et al .",
    "2008 , gezari et al . 2008 ; and by _ swift _ , soderberg et al . 2008 ; data shown as red and black circles in fig .",
    "[ sbscfig ] ) .",
    "the shock cooling phase is longer and more luminous in larger stars .",
    "these works and , in particular , more recent models ( e.g. nakar & sari 2010 , hereafter ns10 ; rabinak & waxman 2011 , hereafter rw11 ) demonstrate that the shock breakout and subsequent cooling phases during the first days after explosion encode information about the sn progenitor radius and surface composition , the explosion energy per unit mass , and the line of sight extinction ( see below for details ) .",
    "this is strong motivation to design surveys targeting early uv emission from sne . in this paper",
    "we use the results of a pilot ptf / galex survey to robustly estimate the number of early sn detections expected from such surveys .",
    "hr post explosion ) no optical / uv data exist .",
    "the models of sapir et al .",
    "( 2013 ; solid ) and nakar & sari ( 2010 ; rescaled , see text ; dashed ) approximately agree in peak value , but differ in details .",
    "forthcoming uv surveys ( e.g. , ultrasat ; sagiv et al . 2014 ) will observe such early emission and further constrain models . at later times",
    "rabinak & waxman 2011 ( rw11 ; solid ) models for red supergiant stars ( rsg ; thick black ) and compact w - r stars ( he , thick cyan and c / o , thin cyan ) compare well with uv observations from _ swift_/uvot ( sn 2008d , type ib , soderberg et al .",

    "2008 , gezari et al .",

    "blue supergiant ( bsg ) models ( thin blue ) are currently untested . stellar classes ( rsg / bsg / wr ) differ greatly in their uv peaks making early uv observations a strong discriminator among progenitor classes .",

( 2008 ) and rw11 ( for sn 2008d).,width=585 ]    we review the derivation of physical progenitor and sn parameters from early observations of sne in @xmath21 and describe a sample of sne with early uv emission detected by a galex / ptf wide - field experiment in @xmath22 .",
    "we summarize our implementation of theoretical models in @xmath23 and show that these fit the handful of available data .",
    "we then combine these models with volumetric sn rates to estimate the expected number of detections from the galex experiment we conducted in @xmath24 , show our fiducial models fit the observations well , and provide validated predictions for the proposed ultrasat space mission ( sagiv et al .",
    "we conclude in @xmath25 .",
    "the early shock - cooling emission from sne is governed by simple and well understood physics and can thus be used to derive robust constraints on the physical parameters of the exploding star and of the explosion . roughly , the rise - time to peak",
    "determines the progenitor radius @xmath26 , the peak flux determines the explosion energy per unit ejecta mass @xmath27 , and the post - peak light curve constrains the surface composition @xmath28 ( rw11 ) .",
    "this simple physics description holds as long as the temperature in the emitting region is @xmath29ev ( see rw11 for details  ev ( rw11 ) : complicated opacity variations , significant contribution to the luminosity from recombination , and penetration of the photosphere into deep envelope layers , which did not initially ( i.e. before the explosion ) lie at a very small distance , @xmath30 , from the surface of the star .",
    "as long as the emission is dominated by shells with @xmath31 , the luminosity and the color temperature are nearly independent of the pre - explosion density distribution . as the photosphere penetrates deeper , the emission becomes dependent on the details of the density distribution ( see the `` + '' signs in figs . 2 - 4 of rw11 , indicating the limit of model validity ) . ] ) , for which the emission peak is at @xmath32 . in all optical bands ( including the @xmath33 band )",
    "the emission peak occurs only after the temperature falls below this threshold value ( see rubin et al .",
    "2015 for detailed discussion ) .",
    "for this reason , the observational photometric parameters ( rise - time to peak , peak flux ) can not be related to physical parameters via a simple and robust model , making optical - light observations not useful for this analysis .    for commonly assumed progenitor parameters",
    ", shock breakout is expected to be accompanied by soft ( @xmath34kev ) x - ray emission with luminosity of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for bsg ( rsg / he - wr ) progenitors ( sapir , katz & waxman 2013 ) . however , the ability to use x - ray observations to constrain progenitor and explosion parameters is limited by several factors .",
    "\\(i ) first , the theory of x - ray emission from massive star explosions is not sufficiently well understood to ensure that stellar / explosion parameters can be reliably constrained based on x - ray observations .",
    "this is reflected , for example , by the fact that none of the few x - ray detections can be explained as shock breakout from a stellar edge ( e.g. , sapir et al .",
    "2013 ) ; these rather require more complex structures ( such as winds or extended envelopes , e.g. , campana et al .",
    "2006 ; moriya et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) second , the detection rate of x - ray breakouts is expected to be very low , even for future instruments with order of magnitude better sensitivities than past or current instruments .",
    "the non - detection of the predicted @xmath37 soft x - ray breakout signal of bsg explosions ( which are expected to dominate the detection event rate ) in archival searches of rosat ( vikhlinin 1998 ) and xmm ( law et al . 2004 ) data imply an upper limit of @xmath38 on the rate of such events ( sapir et al .",
    "2013 ; sapir & halbertal 2014 ) which is about two orders of magnitude lower than the expected bsg explosion rate .",
    "this discrepancy may be related to the above mentioned tension between model predictions and observations , or to high obscuration of the explosions . in any case",
    ", it implies that a soft x - ray detector with a 1  sr fov and sensitivity of @xmath39 ( over @xmath40  s ) will detect @xmath41 events per year ( consistent with the null detection of such events so far by maxi ; camp et al .",
    "2013 ) . in a similar manner we can estimate the detection rate of early x - ray emission from sne from the discovery of the early x - ray signal from sn 2008d by soderberg et al .",
    "swift - xrt could detect sn 2008d - like events out to @xmath42mpc ( soderberg 2008 ) .",
    "even future wide - field lobster telescopes will have a sensitivity which is @xmath3 times less than xrt ( camp et al .",
    "2013 ) , and thus would detect such events only to @xmath43mpc .",
    "this implies that even if the x - ray breakout rate is as high as the entire core - collapse sn rate , @xmath44mpc@xmath45y@xmath46 , such a future mission would detect 3 events per year ( for an all sky detector ) .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , we note that massive star explosions associated with strong high - energy short transients , gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) and x - ray flashes ( xrf ) , like sn 2006aj ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ) , are both not understood theoretically and are very rare in the volumetric sense , as they account for @xmath47 of core - collapse sne ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the detection of such events can not therefore be used to study the general properties of sn progenitor / explosion parameters .",
    "thus , there is strong motivation to study early sn emission in the uv .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the early uv emission from sne remains nearly constant , while the temperature of the cooling , expanding gas declines with time . in",
    "any given band , the measured flux will rise as the peak of the emitted spectrum cools and approaches the band center , reaching maximum when the spectral peak is within the band , then declines as further cooling drives the emission peak to redder wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ scbasics ] ; see an animated version on http://www.weizmann.ac.il/astrophysics/ultrasat/animations/ganot14a.gif ) .",
    "the rate of cooling ( and thus the time it takes for the flux to peak in a given band ) depends on the stellar radius and the composition of the envelope which determines the opacity . for supergiant explosions with thick hydrogen envelopes ,",
    "the opacity is known ( thomson scattering ) and time independent , so the radius is straightforwardly inferred ( fig .  [ getr ] ) .",
    "for evolved ( e.g. , w - r ) stars the opacity is a function of the surface composition ( mass fraction of he , c and o ) .",
    "rw11 show that , given a well - sampled uv light curve , one can infer the stellar radius and constrain the surface composition ( fig .  [ getz ] ) .",

    "the rapid decline of the temperature leads to an nuv peak around 2 days after explosion , when the black - body peak temperature crosses this band , while the optical @xmath51-band continues to rise beyond day 5 .",

    "as can be seen , progenitor radii within the typical range for rsg stars ( @xmath52r@xmath0 ) can be readily distinguished by the light curve shape ( time to peak ) .",

    "well - sampled early uv data ( @xmath2day ) can readily diagnose both the radius and composition of compact stars.,width=642 ]    model calculations such as those of rw11 above assume standard massive star models and this leads to the prediction of a nearly - constant shock - cooling luminosity .",
    "however , some recent works hint that at least some stars undergo violent pre - explosion evolution , e.g. , eruptive mass loss ( e.g. , pastorello et a. 2007 ; ofek et al .",
    "2013 , 2014a , gal - yam et al . 2014 ) and thus their pre - explosion density distribution may strongly deviate from standard models . in this case the shock - cooling luminosity will not be constant .    however , rw11 also show that by combining uv and optical data one can determine the exact extinction towards an event and , correcting for it , measure both the temperature evolution and the radius without any assumptions regarding a constant shock - cooling luminosity .",
    "for such events , the luminosity and temperature evolution extracted from the uv+optical data will then measure the non - standard density profile , mapping recent pre - explosion mass loss and the physics of the final stages of stellar evolution .    in all cases ,",
    "the extinction - corrected absolute luminosity evolution can be used to derive the energy per unit mass in the exploding ejecta ( e / m ) , yet another vital constraint on the explosion ( fig .",
    "[ getem ] ) .",
    "the full route from uv light curves to physical stellar parameters has been demonstrated for ( the only ) three sn events with useful data ( types ii and ib ; schawinski et al .",

    "2008 ) by rw11 .",
    "[ rnevspeaknrt ] shows how the progenitor radius and the explosion energy per unit mass can be directly derived from measurements of the uv peak absolute magnitude and rise time .",
    "useful formulae to connect the observed parameters to rw11 model parameters are provided below , for radii r@xmath8 measured in units of the solar radius r@xmath0 , energy e in units of @xmath1erg and normalized to ejecta masses of @xmath50m@xmath0 .",
    "we provide formulae for the absolute magnitude in the ultrasat band ( m@xmath55 ) , as well as for the _ swift _ uvw1 and uvw2 bands ( m@xmath56 , m@xmath57 ) .",

    "the light curve shapes are identical ( since these depend only on the radii and composition ) while the luminosity is a function of the ratio e / m ( e.g. , compare the dashed green and thin black curves ) . assuming the extinction toward an event has been measured via the combination of uv and optical observations ( rw11 )",
    ", one can use the luminosity to measure the value of e / m .",
    "additional optical observations over longer time scales can constrain the ejected mass and allow to independently infer both the explosion energy and the ejected mass separately ( e.g. , barbarino et al . 2014).,width=642 ]        early uv emission is thus a powerful way to study the progenitor properties of sne , motivating efforts to measure it systematically for a large sample of sn events by wide - field uv surveys",
