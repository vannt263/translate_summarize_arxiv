    "the study of powerful high - z radiogalaxies ( hereafter @xmath16 ) can yield crucial information on the properties , on the formation epoch and on the evolution of radiosources and their surrounding protoclusters . to this end",
    "it is essential to have statistically homogeneous samples .",
    "the ultra steep spectrum sources ( @xmath17 , somewhat depending on the selection frequency , @xmath18 ; hereafter uss ) of relatively small angular size have been proved over the past years to be good tracers of powerful @xmath16 . up to the last year",
    "there were about @xmath19 radiogalaxies known with @xmath20 ( de breuck et al .",
    "1997 ) , but these have been obtained from collection of different datasets , resulting in quite heterogeneous samples , from which it is difficult to derive statistical answers ( as stressed by rttgering et al .",
    "1997 ) . to date",
    ", the most distant known agn is a radiogalaxy with redshift @xmath21 ( van breugel et al .",
    "the radio source was selected from a new sample of ultra - steep spectrum sources and it has an extreme radio spectral index of @xmath22",

    "radio telescope in bologna ( see ficarra et al .",
    "1985 for the instrument description ) we have performed a new @xmath0 mhz survey , down to @xmath9 jy , tailored to provide an homogeneous and low - frequency selected sample of uss .",
    "the survey was made at the lowest declination observable with the  croce del nord  .",
    "the sky area has been chosen so to be easily observed both by northern and southern emisphere optical telescopes .",
    "an identical search ( rhee et al . 1996 ) was carried out over this sky region to select 4c uss but , if we assume a spectral index @xmath23 , the b3.1 uss sample is about one order of magnitude deeper in flux with respect to the 4c uss .",
    "presently it is not known whether this lower flux limit will result in an increased fraction of @xmath16 in our survey with respect to the 4c .",
    "the nvss ( condon et al . 1998 ) maps have been used to find the @xmath24 ghz counterpart of each @xmath0 mhz selected source and to compute the spectral index @xmath11 .",
    "the present paper provides a description of this bologna sky survey ( to be referred as the b3.1 survey ) and of the new uss sample ( b3.1 uss ) . the survey and",
    "the data are described in sect .",
    "2 . section 3 deals with the vla - nvss maps cross - identification .",
    "consistency and data quality checks are discussed in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 the b3.1 uss sample radio properties are described , together with preliminary results of the optical identification programme .",
    "the surveys performed with the  croce del nord  radio telescope prior to the b3.1 are summarized in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the existence of a correlation between the flux density and the spectral index could be relevant to the study of the radio sources evolution .",
    "previous works ( grueff et al . 1995 and references therein ) did not show any variations of the average spectral index with the flux density in the range @xmath25 .",
    "we subdivided the flux range @xmath26 into four bins and we calculated the median spectral index for each flux bin .",
    "the straight line ( see fig.6 ) is the weighted least - square fit to the data points and the following relation resulted :    @xmath27    with a @xmath28 .",
    "however a fit with an horizontal line gives @xmath29 , corresponding to @xmath30 probability .",
    "thus , we find little evidence of a change in spectral index with the flux .",
    "the selection criteria defining our uss sample are : @xmath31 jy , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( as measured on the nvss maps ) and @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the zone with r.a @xmath35h @xmath36 m to @xmath37h @xmath36 m was excluded to avoid low galactic latitude objects ( i.e. @xmath38 ) . out of a list of @xmath39 sources , only about @xmath40",
    "were retained after applying the selection criteria above , and accurately checking the individual radio data .",
    "the b3.1 uss sample thus contains @xmath12 sources .",
    "the numerical values adopted for the selection criteria are similar to those used by other groups ( blundell et al .",
    "1998 ; de breuck et al . 1997 ; rhee et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the angular size criterium helps to eliminate relatively nearby objects , objects with @xmath24 ghz flux affected by resolution errors , and extended sources dificult to identify optically .",
    "there are @xmath41 b3.1 sources with a nvss cross - id , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( hereafter b3id sample ) and these provided the @xmath12 uss sample . in the following",
    "we try to estimate the number of uss lost because of the various sources of incompleteness .",
    "there are two important factors which may affect the b3.1 uss sample .",
    "first , the b3.1 survey is statistically complete to @xmath42 jy , but the uss have been extracted down to @xmath43 jy . from table 2",
    "( columns 2,4 since for the uss search the avoidance areas have not been considered ) and fig.7 we calculate that about @xmath44 uss have not been detected in the flux bin @xmath45 jy because of the b3.1 incompleteness .    secondly , the presence of bps on the nvss maps does not permit the spectral index for a considerable fraction of b3.1 sources to be calculated .",
    "contrarily to the previous one , this factor affects all the uss population , irrespectively of the radio flux .",
    "there are @xmath46 bp sources with @xmath32 . as @xmath47 of the sources with a nvss cross - id and @xmath32 have @xmath33 , then out of @xmath46 bp sources , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 )",
    "are expected to have @xmath33 .",
    "we expect that out of these @xmath48 bp sources , @xmath50 could be uss lost because of bps in the nvss maps .",
    "to conclude , we estimate that about @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) uss have not been detected because of these incompleteness factors .      as a first approximation ,",
    "probing lower fluxes should correspond to sampling more distant objects .",
    "although this zero - order expectation could turn out to be wrong , our survey has been made following this suggestion . to compare the relative sentitivities of the most important low - frequency radio surveys , used to derive uss samples , a plot of the limiting flux versus selection frequency",
    "is shown in fig.7 .",
    "with respect to the 4c uss sample ( chambers et al .",
    "1996 ) , the b3.1 uss allows to investigate sources almost one order of magnitude deeper in flux , resulting in a lower intrinsic radio power or possibly a higher redshift for the objects .",
    "moreover , as a radio - optical correlation exists ( tielens et al .",
    "1979 , laing & peacock 1980 ) , probing low radio powers helps to select those objects with low optical luminosity as well .",
    "their optical emission is thus less contaminated by the agn nucleus and the surrounding stellar population can be better outlined .",
    "furthermore , a wider coverage of the @xmath53 plane is achieved , with benefits in the statistical study of the radio sources intrinsic properties .",
    "fig.8 shows the @xmath54 distribution for the 4c uss and our sample . for the 4c uss , the @xmath54",
    "was obtained by the @xmath55 or taken from the b3 catalogue when available .",
    "the lack of uss with @xmath56 jy is clearly seen in the 4c sample .",
    "note that only @xmath57 of the b3.1 uss have @xmath58 jy .",
    "the most recent uss sample , selected by a low - frequency survey and also covering the same sky region as our , is the tn sample ( de breuck et al .",
    "it resulted from a cross - correlation of the texas catalogue with the nvss , adopting a spectral index cut - off @xmath59 .",
    "as the texas survey ( douglas et al .",
    "1996 ) is @xmath60 complete at @xmath61 mjy , the b3.1 uss sample contains sources up to two times fainter , and from fig.8 we estimate that @xmath62 b3.1 uss have fluxes too faint to have been included in the tn sample .",
    "fig.9 shows the spectral index distribution for the 4c uss and b3.1 uss samples .",
    "the median @xmath11 is @xmath63 while the median @xmath55 is @xmath64 .",
    "the two distributions are very similar .",
    "although higher resolution maps are needed to measure precise radio sizes and positions , some statistical considerations may be derived also using the radio sizes given by our fitting algorithm .",
    "a comparison between the nvss catalogue deconvolved sizes and the b3.1 radio sizes for a subset of uss sources , showed a substantial agreement within few arcseconds .",
    "out of the @xmath12 uss , @xmath65 were fitted with a double - component model , while the remaining @xmath66 sources ( 54% ) had overall sizes less than @xmath67 and were fitted with a single - component model ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . thus there is indication that about @xmath68 of the b3.1 uss are smaller than @xmath69 arcsec ( see fig.10 ) .",
    "other authors ( blundell et al . 1998 ) used much restrictive size selection criteria ( @xmath70 ) with the aim of retaining the @xmath71 uss objects in the 6c survey .",
    "however , they showed that about @xmath72 of the 3c radiogalaxies , if redshifted to @xmath73 , would be lost because of this size cut .",
    "as for the known uss some spread in @xmath74 is evident , a too low size cut could make easier the identification process , but it may result in excluding several sources . we compared the size distribution of our uss with that of the existing @xmath75 mhz samples ( rttgering et al .",
    "1994 ) , finding a good agreement .",
    "because we are interested in selecting only very distant ( and thus optically very faint ) objects , we firstly examinated the digitized poss - i red plates to select those uss with no visible optical counterpart . a square box",
    "@xmath76 arcsec wide centered at the nvss position was inspected , resulting in a total of @xmath13 ( 79% ) empty fields ( ef ) down to @xmath77 .",
    "any uss with at least one optical object falling inside the box was excluded , irrespectively of it s true optical i d .",
    "consequently , @xmath78 is a lower limit to the fraction of ef in the uss sample .",
    "the adopted box size value was derived from very conservative considerations about the nvss r.m.s .",
    "position error , the possible intrinsic radio - optical displacement of a radiosource , and the nvss maps low resolution .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath79 ) maps and much deeper optical material are necessary for a secure optical identification . to date , the vla - first @xmath24 ghz ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) survey overlaps only in part the b3.1 survey region .",
    "we obtained first maps for @xmath14 b3.1 uss , and in most cases , the resolution ( @xmath80 ) is high enough to permit a morphological classification of the sources . for @xmath81 uss , the optical counterpart is visible on the poss - i plates . for the remaining @xmath82 uss ,",
    "the optical identification on the deeper poss - ii ( @xmath83 ) was carried out , resulting in one i d , two uncertain cases and 39 are ef . out of these @xmath82 uss ,",
    "@xmath84 are unresolved , @xmath85 are double , @xmath86 are triple and one is a multiple source .",
    "this paper describes the first results of an effort to discover high - z radiogalaxies selecting very steep spectrum radiosources .",
    "the technique of the radio spectrum steepness has been exploited by many groups and it revelead to be an effective way to find high redshift radiogalaxies . the present uss sample is about one order of magnitude deeper in flux with respect to the 4c uss sample , and about a factor of two with respect to the recent tn sample ( van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ) based on the texas @xmath75mhz survey .    in this paper we described the realization of the survey , which was the first step to build - up the b3.1 uss sample , and some details of the observing and reduction procedure .",
    "the definition of the b3.1 sources catalogue was obtained by comparison of the log n - log s function with that of the previous b3 survey .",
    "the b3.1 survey is complete to @xmath8 jy but many sources down to @xmath9 jy are listed giving a total of @xmath87 sources .",
    "a cross - id with the nvss @xmath24 ghz maps gave us precise radio positions and fluxes to calculate the spectral index @xmath11 .",
    "the radio positions displacement ( b3.1 - nvss ) histograms have gaussian shape with a dispersion decreasing from about @xmath67 in the flux interval @xmath88 jy to about @xmath89 in the @xmath90 jy interval .",
    "our flux scale is in accordance with that of baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) to within @xmath91 , while daily instrumental gain drift possibly affecting our data were found to be negligible .",
    "we found no evidence of a change of the radio spectrum as flux decreases .",
    "as uss selection criteria we used : @xmath34 and @xmath33 and these gave a total of @xmath12 sources which constitute the b3.1 uss sample .",
    "we started the search of their optical counterparts on the digitized poss - i plates in order to select only the empty fields to @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , we collected first maps ( @xmath80 resolution ) for @xmath14 uss sources and we searched for their optical counterparts on the poss - ii prints ( @xmath83 ) . for @xmath15",
    "uss no optical i d was found , and out of these , @xmath84 are unresolved in the first maps .",
    "the fact that these small sources also have the steepest spectra among the b3.1 uss sources suggests they could reliably be high - z objects .    to date",
