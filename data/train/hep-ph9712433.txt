    "over the last seven years @xmath3 collision experiments at lep and at the slac linear collider have beautifully confirmed the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) . at present experiment and theory",
    "agree at the 0.1   1% level in the determination of the vector boson couplings to the various fermions  @xcite , which may rightly be considered a confirmation of the gauge boson nature of the @xmath4 and the  @xmath5 . on the other hand , the most direct consequences of the @xmath6 gauge symmetry , the non - abelian self - couplings of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and photon , are known with much less experimental precision .    a direct measurement of these vector boson couplings is possible in hadron and lepton collider experiments , in particular via pair production processes like @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the first and major goal of such experiments will be a confirmation of the sm predictions . a precise and direct measurement of the trilinear couplings of the electroweak vector bosons and the demonstration that they agree with the sm",
    "would beautifully corroborate spontaneously broken , non - abelian gauge theories as the basic theoretical structure describing the fundamental interactions of nature . at the same time , such measurements may be used to probe for new physics . however ,",
    "if the energy scale of the new physics responsible for the non - standard gauge boson couplings is @xmath9  tev , these anomalous couplings are expected to be no larger than @xmath10  @xcite .    in the following , we present an overview of how trilinear gauge boson couplings are measured in collider experiments .",
    "for simplicity , we shall restrict our discussion to the @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) couplings ; @xmath12 couplings are not discussed .",
    "analogous to the introduction of arbitrary vector and axial vector couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the coupling of gauge bosons to fermions , the measurement of the @xmath0 couplings can be made quantitative by introducing a more general @xmath0 vertex . for our discussion of experimental sensitivities we shall use a parameterization in terms of the phenomenological effective lagrangian  @xcite @xmath15\\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the overall couplings are defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . within the sm , at tree level ,",
    "the couplings are given by @xmath20 .",
    "for on - shell photons , @xmath21 is fixed by electromagnetic gauge invariance ; @xmath22 may , however , differ from its sm value .",
    "deviations are given by the anomalous couplings @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the effective lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ leffwwv ] ) parameterizes the most general lorentz invariant and @xmath28 and @xmath29 conserving @xmath0 vertex which can be observed in processes where the vector bosons couple to effectively massless fermions . if @xmath28 or @xmath29 violating couplings are allowed , four additional couplings , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , appear in the effective lagrangian  @xcite and they all vanish in the sm , at tree level . for simplicity ,",
    "these couplings are not considered in this report .",
    "the terms in @xmath34 correspond to the lowest order terms in a multipole expansion of the @xmath35photon interactions , the charge @xmath36 , the magnetic dipole moment @xmath37 , and the electric quadrupole moment @xmath38 of the @xmath39  @xcite : @xmath40 terms with higher derivatives are equivalent to a dependence of the couplings on the vector boson momenta and thus merely lead to a form - factor behaviour of these couplings .",
    "since a constant anomalous coupling would lead to unitarity violation at high energies  @xcite such a form factor behaviour is a feature of any model of anomalous couplings . when studying @xmath41 production at a lepton collider at fixed @xmath42 this form factor behaviour is of no consequence .",
    "weak boson pair production at hadron colliders , however , probes the gauge boson couplings over a large @xmath43 range and is very sensitive to the fall - off of anomalous couplings which necessarily happens once the threshold of new physics is crossed .",
    "not taking this cutoff into account results in unphysically large cross sections at high energy ( which violate unitarity ) and thus leads to a substantial overestimate of experimental sensitivities .",
    "in the following we will assume a simple dipole behaviour , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath44 and similarly for the other couplings . here , @xmath45 is the form factor scale which is a function of the scale of new physics , @xmath46 .",
    "due to the form factor behaviour of the anomalous couplings , the experimental limits extracted from hadron collider experiments explicitly depend on @xmath45 .    from the phenomenological effective lagrangian [",
    "( [ leffwwv ] ) ] it is straightforward to derive cross section formulas for the di - boson production processes , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath41 production in @xmath49 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 annihilation . while the sm contribution to the di - boson amplitudes is bounded from above for fixed scattering angle @xmath50 , the anomalous contributions rise without limit as @xmath51 increases , eventually violating unitarity .",
    "this is the reason the anomalous couplings must show a form factor behavior at very high energies .",
    "anomalous gauge boson couplings also affect the angular distributions of the produced vector bosons in a characteristic way ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in hadronic collisions , the transverse momentum distribution of the vector boson should be particularly sensitive to non - standard @xmath0 couplings . at lepton colliders , on the other hand , where the center of mass energy is fixed ,",
    "angular distributions are more useful .",
    "hadron and lepton collider data thus thus yield complementary information on the nature of the @xmath0 couplings  @xcite .",
    "presently , the most stringent limits on anomalous @xmath0 couplings come from the d  and cdf experiments at the tevatron , and from the four lep experiments .",
    "while the di - boson analysis of d  is fairly complete , the cdf collaboration has not presented final results from their analysis of run  1b data yet .",
    "the tevatron experiments obtained information on the structure of the @xmath0 vertices from @xmath52 production with subsequent @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) decay , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 production with one of the vector bosons decaying leptonically and the other gauge boson decaying into two jets .",
    "limits were also obtained from a combined fit to the three processes .",
    "@xmath58 candidates were selected from the inclusive @xmath59 channel @xmath4 samples by requiring an isolated photon with high transverse energy ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the main background sources for @xmath52 production are @xmath61  jets production where one of the jets `` fakes '' a photon , and @xmath62 production with one of the leptons from the @xmath5 decay being undetected .",
    "the signal to background ratio is about 1 to 0.2   0.3 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the cdf and d  @xmath52 event selection can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . to set limits on the @xmath63 couplings",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath26 , a binned maximum likelihood fit to the photon @xmath60 spectrum was performed , using a monte carlo program based on the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , and a form factor scale of @xmath65  tev .",
    "the d  95% cl limit contour is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , together with the bands allowed by the cleo  @xcite and aleph  @xcite @xmath66 data .",
    "the cdf and d  95% cl limits on for @xmath64 and @xmath26 are listed in table  [ tab : one ] .",
    ".95% cl limits on @xmath63 anomalous couplings from cdf and d .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     at the lhc , sensitivities of @xmath10 can be reached  @xcite with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath67 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : two]b where we show the limits which can be reached in @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . the sensitivity bounds",
    "which can be obtained at the lhc depend significantly on the form factor scale .",
    "since the lep2 center of mass energy is only slightly above the @xmath4 pair threshold , the sm gauge cancellations are not fully operative , and the sensitivity to anomalous gauge boson couplings is limited .",
    "much better limits on @xmath0 couplings will be possible at a linear @xmath3 collider ( nlc ) , or a @xmath2 collider ( fmc ) , operating in the several hundred gev range or above .",
    "a variety of processes can be used to constrain the vector boson self - interactions at the nlc or fmc . because the limits obtained from @xmath4 pair production  @xcite are comparable or better than those obtained from other processes , we restrict ourselves to this process in the following .",
    "a study  @xcite based on ideal reconstruction of @xmath4 daughter pairs in @xmath70 and ignoring initial state radiation ( isr ) , found the following 95% cl limits in the hisz scenario  @xcite ( @xmath71  gev , @xmath72 ) : @xmath73-channel @xmath74-exchange diagram , a @xmath75 cut on the @xmath4 production angle @xmath76 has been imposed .",
    "no detailed simulations have yet been carried out for the fmc . nevertheless , a few general conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the main differences between @xmath4 pair production in @xmath3 and @xmath2 collisions are    * the background in the detector caused by the decay of the muons  @xcite , and * the reduced level of initial state radiation due to the larger mass of the muons .    in the following we concentrate on the impact of initial state radiation on the measurement of the @xmath0 couplings at a lepton collider .    for the nlc , these effects were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "initial state radiation is strongly peaked in the beam direction and at zero photon energy .",
    "many photons originating from isr therefore are not detected .",
    "the emission of an undetected photon along the beam direction affects the kinematics of the visible decay products , and a kinematic fit assuming full energy momentum conservation results in incorrect production and decay angles .",
    "in addition , photon emission leads to a reduced effective center of mass energy , and thus to distorted angular distributions .    in @xmath77 events , the photon momentum vector can in principle",
    "be fully reconstructed . in the semileptonic case ,",
    "@xmath78 , the presence of the neutrino makes this more difficult . assuming that the photon is emitted in beam direction , a kinematic fit to the event can be performed .",
    "isr effects can be reduced by requiring that the fitted photon energy is less than a fraction @xmath79 of the nominal center of mass energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : three]a shows the efficiencies obtained for @xmath71  gev and @xmath80 as a function of @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the undetected neutrino leads to a degradation in the photon energy resolution , resulting in a large loss in efficiency for small values of @xmath79 .",
    "figure  [ fig : three]b displays the corresponding biases in fitted @xmath64 values for the hisz scenario as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "the bias is small compared to the statistical error only for @xmath81 . due to the loss in efficiency at small",
    "@xmath79 , the error on @xmath64 increases significantly with decreasing @xmath79 .    for @xmath82 events the momenta of the two neutrinos are unknown .",
    "if isr is ignored , the neutrino momenta can be reconstructed up to a two - fold ambiguity .",
    "initial state radiation influences the existence of solutions , and introduces a large bias in the extracted values of anomalous couplings  @xcite .    at the fmc ,",
    "one expects the effects caused by isr to be substantially smaller than at the nlc .",
    "it should therefore be possible to measure anomalous @xmath0 couplings at a @xmath2 collider with similar or better precision than at a @xmath3 machine operating at the same center of mass energy and luminosity , unless backgrounds from muon decay in the detector play an important role .",
    "clearly , more detailed work is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn .",
    "within the past few years , our experimental knowledge of the gauge boson self - interactions has grown very rapidly .",
    "the @xmath0 coupling parameters have been measured with an accuracy of 20  ",
    "45% at the tevatron . within the next few years",
    "the limits on anomalous couplings are expected to improve by a factor 4  to  5 by experiments at lep2 and the tevatron . at the lhc ,",
    "one hopes to probe non - standard @xmath0 couplings with a precision of @xmath10 . at the nlc",
    ", anomalous couplings can be tested at the @xmath83 level .",
    "a similar or better precision is expected for a @xmath2 collider operating at the same energy and luminosity .",
