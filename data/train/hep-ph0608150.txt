    "three charged leptons are known , the electron and the heavier @xmath0 and @xmath1 leptons @xcite . relations between their mass values have been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that the empirical formula    @xmath2 ,    where @xmath3 is the mass of the electron , gives    @xmath4 mev / c@xmath5    which is 0.5 per cent off the mass of the @xmath0-lepton @xcite , and    @xmath6 mev / c@xmath5    which is 1.2 per cent off the mass of the @xmath1-lepton @xcite . that this formula reproduces the mass values of @xmath0 and of @xmath1 fairly well for integer values of @xmath7 as if @xmath7 is a quantum number suggests that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are excited states of the electron .",
    "if so , the electron would have to be a complex system of some constituents , e.g. rishons / preons @xcite .",
    "the electron and the proton are both stable particles . while a proton has constituents , has an electron constituents ?    if so , and if they by analogy to the three quarks in a proton were two @xmath8 with electric charge @xmath9 each , and one @xmath10 with electric charge @xmath11 , where each @xmath8 and @xmath10 has lepton number @xmath12 , then a system with one @xmath8 and two @xmath10 could correspond to a neutrino .",
    "an @xmath13 system with lepton number zero could correspond to a boson . if @xmath8 and @xmath14 analogous to quarks may be `` dressed '' as proposed in fig.1 , an @xmath13 system may decay to a @xmath15 pair .",
    "`` spectators '' and `` leading particles '' are seen in @xmath16 reactions where a beam proton collides with the neutron in the deuteron with its proton as spectator @xcite , and in @xmath17 reactions with a leading meson due to a dressed spectator quark @xcite .",
    "if @xmath18 and @xmath19 have some structure , leading spectator constituents could by analogy be expected also in e.g. @xmath15 collisions .",
    "if they by analogy to quarks may be `` dressed '' , they may be observed .",
    "if one @xmath8 of a colliding @xmath18 is scattered and dressed to be an @xmath13 boson which decays to an @xmath15 pair , with the remaning @xmath20 system as a spectator which is dressed to be an @xmath21 electron as proposed in fig.2 , the result is trident production , i.e.    @xmath22 .",
    "tridents have been observed @xcite and discussed from theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "our fig.2 suggests an additional production model .",
    "our empirical mass formula and model for trident production suggest that electrons may have an inner structure and some constituents .",
