    "a quest for the origins of the quark mass hierarchy , the structure of the flavor mixing , and the three generations of the fermions is one of the important tasks in particle physics .",
    "lots of experiments have succeeded in measuring values of the quark masses and the elements of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix with good precision .",
    "a complex phase in the ckm matrix due to the three generations has been proposed to explain an origin of the cp violation @xcite , and the existence of the cp phase has been well established by b physics experiments . however , the standard model ( sm ) does not initiate us into the origins of quark mass hierarchy , the structure of the flavor mixing , and three generations of the fermions even though the sm contains these structures .",
    "thus we consider that there is a more fundamental theory beyond the sm .    in the context of higher dimensional field theories , which are one of the candidates of beyond the sm",
    ", we propose a new mechanism to produce a cp phase and construct a five - dimensional ( 5d ) phenomenological model with @xmath0 compactification which can naturally explain all the flavor structure of the sm , i.e. the origins of the fermion generations , the quark mass hierarchy and the structure of the ckm matrix with the cp phase .",
    "we put point interactions on @xmath0 , which are additional boundary points on @xmath0 , to realized the three generations from a single 5d fermion .",
    "it should be emphasized that 5d yukawa couplings can not be the origin of the cp phase in our model because the model contains only a single generation fermions for each 5d quark .",
    "a twisted boundary condition ( bc ) for the higgs doublet leads to a cp phase degree of freedom .",
    "the higgs vev with an extra dimensional coordinate dependent phase is a key and will be derived in the next section .",
    "we also introduce an extra dimensional coordinate dependent vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a gauge singlet scalar field to realize the quark mass hierarchy .",
    "the robin bc for the gauge singlet scalar field can lead to suitable form of the vev .",
    "the structure of the flavor mixing is determined by the geometry of the extra dimension in our model .",
    "first , we discuss the property of the vev of a @xmath1 higgs doublet @xmath2 with a twisted boundary condition on @xmath0 .",
    "the action we consider is @xmath3.\\label{doubletaction }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we impose the twisted boundary condition on @xmath2 as @xmath4 here , we take the range of @xmath5 as @xmath6 . we will obtain the vev of @xmath7 minimizing the functional @xmath8 = \\int_0^{l } dy \\bigl[\\ |\\partial_y h|^2 - { m}^2 |h|^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2 } |h|^4 \\ \\bigr].\\label{functional }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to find the minimization condition of the functional @xmath9 , we introduce @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "the vev of @xmath12 which minimize the functional @xmath9 will lead us to the vev of @xmath13 .",
    "see ref.@xcite in details .",
    "the vev @xmath7 is given , without any loss of generality , as follows :    * for @xmath14 case @xmath15 * for @xmath16 case @xmath17    where @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 in the following , we will assume the case of @xmath14 .",
    "now we discuss some properties of the derived vev in eq .",
    "( [ doubletvevform1 ] ) . differently from the sm",
    ", the vev possesses @xmath20-position - dependence and its broken phase is realized only in the case of @xmath21 .",
    "but like the sm , the squared vev  ( [ squared_vev ] ) is still constant even though @xmath7 depends on @xmath20 .",
    "this means that after @xmath22 is set as @xmath23 , where the mass dimension of @xmath18 is @xmath24 , the same situation as the sm occurs in the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector . on the other hand , the @xmath20-dependence of the higgs vev in eq .",
    "( [ doubletvevform1 ] ) is an important consequence for the yukawa sector .",
    "since the vev of the higgs doublet appears linearly in each yukawa term , the overlap integrals which lead to effective 4d yukawa couplings will produce non - trivial cp phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "we also comment on the higgs - quarks couplings in our model .",
    "the profiles of the vev and the higgs physical zero mode in our model are the same as @xmath25 up to the coefficients .",
    "this means that the strengths of the couplings are equivalent to those of the sm even though the mode function gets to be @xmath20-position dependent . as a result , the decay branching ratios of the higgs boson are the same as those of the sm .",
    "possible deviations in the partial widths of the one - loop induced processes could be small when we take the kaluza - klein ( kk ) scale around a few tev .",
    "field localization in extra dimensions is known as an effective way of explaining the quark mass hierarchy and pattern of flavor mixing . for this purpose ,",
    "we follow the strategy in @xcite , where point interactions are introduced in the bulk space to split and localize fermion profiles and also to produce a @xmath20-position - dependent vev with an ( almost ) exponential shape , which generates the large fermion mass hierarchy . but in this letter , we set the extra dimension to be a circle @xmath0 not an interval as @xcite .",
    "under the situation , the twisted boundary condition ( [ twistbc ] ) is compatible with the geometry . in the following part ,",
    "we briefly explain how to construct our model .",
