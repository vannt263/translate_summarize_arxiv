    "it is a remarkable fact the in the present day universe about a half of the baryonic matter is `` missing '' , in that it has not yet been accounted for observationally .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation suggest that these baryons may reside in a `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim ) , with temperatures in the range @xmath0  k ( e.g.  cen & ostriker  1999 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 ; bertone et al .",
    "the whim is produced by the shock waves that occur as gas falls from the diffuse intergalactic medium into the dense regions where galaxies form , and is expected to remain hot because of the low densities and high temperatures involved .",
    "recent observations have confirmed the existence of a hot , @xmath0  k gas , both in the local universe ( e.g.  fang et al .",
    "2006 ) , and in more distant environments ( e.g.  tripp et al .  2007 ; savage et al .",

    "they invoked an equilibrium two - phase model , in which most of the ions are created in a warm ( @xmath2  k ) photoionized cloud , while and are created in a hotter ( @xmath3  k ) , collisional phase .",
    "the inferred temperature for the collisional phase is within the range of temperatures where departures from equilibrium ionization are expected to take place ( e.g.  gnat & sternberg  2007 ) . while observations have confirmed the existence of warm / hot clouds , it remains to be determined what fraction of baryons they harbor , and whether they confirm the theoretical predictions regarding the shock heated whim ( furlanetto et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in gnat & sternberg ( 2009 ;",
    "hereafter gs09 ) we computed the metal - absorption column densities in steady - state fast radiative shocks .",
    "we estimated the metal - ion column densities in the post - shock cooling layers , under the assumption of steady - state , completely - cooled shocks ( e.g.  cox  1972 ; dopita  1976 , 1977 ; raymond  1979 ; shull & mckee  1979 ; daltabuit , macalpine & cox  1978 ; binette et al .",

    "the steady - state assumption is only valid for shocks that exist over a time - scale that is longer than their cooling times . in younger shocks that have not yet cooled completely , the shock structure , self - radiation , and resulting column densities are time - dependent . for the cosmological shocks that produce the whim , the steady - state assumption is often not valid .    in this paper ,",
    "i reexamine the absorption - line signatures of fast astrophysical shock , but relax the assumption that they are fully - cooled and in steady - state .",
    "i explicitly consider the properties of partially cooled shocks as a function of shock age .",
    "i compute the integrated column densities produced in the post - shock cooling layers and in the radiative precursors of such partially - cooled fast shocks .",
    "the time - evolution of the shock structure , self - radiation , and associated metal - ion column densities are evaluated by a series of quasi - static models , each appropriate for a different shock age .",
    "i use the shock code presented in gs09 that computes the nonequilibrium ionization and cooling , follows the radiative transfer of the shock self - radiation through the post - shock cooling layers , takes into account the resulting photoionization and heating rates , follows the one - dimensional dynamics of the cooling gas , and self - consistently computes the photoionization states in the precursor gas .    as in gs09 ,",
    "i focus on fast shocks , with velocities of @xmath4 and @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 , corresponding to initial temperatures of @xmath7 and @xmath8  k , and i present a complete set of results for metallicities @xmath9 ranging from @xmath10 to twice the solar abundance of heavy elements .",
    "investigating how the absorption line signatures of fast astrophysical shocks depend on metallicity is particularly interesting in the context of the whim , as parts of the whim are expected to have significant subsolar metallicities ( e.g.  cen & ostriker  2006 ) .",
    "i consider shocks in which the magnetic field is negligible ( @xmath11 ) so that cooling occurs at approximately constant pressure , and shocks in which the magnetic - pressure dominates the pressures everywhere ( @xmath12 ) , and the density remains constant .    in the computations presented here",
    "i use the same simplifying assumptions made in gs09 .",
    "first , i neglect any thermal instabilities that may form in the post - shock cooling layers , even though such instabilities are known to occur for shock velocities in excess of @xmath13  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "second , i assume that the electron and ion temperatures are equal in the downstream gas , because the electron - ion equipartition times are typically @xmath14 of the cooling time ( gs09 ) .",
    "this may lead to some errors for very young shocks that exist for shorter time - scales .",
    "third , i assume that the shocked material is dust - free , or that any initial dust penetrating the shock is rapidly destroyed ( e.g.  by thermal sputtering ) on a time scale that is much shorter than the cooling time . for a detailed discussion of these assumptions",
    "see section  1 in gs09 .",
    "in addition to the assumptions of gs09 , i make one further assumption when following the time - dependent evolution of the shock structure .",
    "i assume that the shock evolution is quasi - static , so that it can be approximated by a series of `` self - contained '' models for the different ages , which are independent of each other .",
    "since the shock structure , self - radiation and associated precursor ionization states do , in fact , evolve continuously over the lifetime of the shock , this discretizaton does lead to small errors in the computed structure of young shocks .",
    "however , as i demonstrate in the following sections , once the shocks exist for @xmath15 of their cooling times , this approximation is generally valid .",
    "in addition , the quasi - static approximation does not significantly affect the computed self - radiation or the integrated column densities .",
    "therefore , the results for very early times ( young shocks with ages @xmath14 of the shock cooling time ) suffer from two main limitations , namely the uncertain validity of the quasi - static assumption , and an age comparable to the electron - ion equipartition time .",
    "in addition , at least in the cosmological context , it is not very likely that we will observe systems with lifetimes that are considerably shorter than a hubble time .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness , and because the integrated metal - ion column densities are not very sensitive to these assumptions , i include young shocks in the discussion that follows .",

    "i also describe the method used to follow the evolution of the shock structure and properties .    after passing the shock front , the gas is initially heated to the shock temperature @xmath16  k , and then cools and recombines , to a degree determined by the shock age .",

    "this includes the removal of electron kinetic energy via collisional excitation followed by prompt line emission , thermal bremsstrahlung , recombination with ions , and collisional ionizations ( see gs07 ; based on the cooling functions included in cloudy ver .",
    "07.02.00 , ferland et al .",
    "i also follow the heating rate @xmath28  ( erg  s@xmath6 ) , due to the absorption of the shock self - radiation @xmath29 , by gas further downstream .",
    "the net local cooling rate is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the total gas particle density .",
    "for the dynamics , i assume one - dimensional strong shocks , and neglect any thermal instabilities that may form .",
    "i follow the standard rankine - hugoniot conditions ( see equations  3 in gs09 ) , which represent the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy fluxes in the flow .",
    "the assumption of a strong shock implies the familiar jump conditions ( e.g.  draine & mckee  1993 ) which relate the pre - shock , and post - shock physical properties : @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the post - shock particle density and velocity , @xmath36 is the pre - shock density , and @xmath37 is the shock velocity .",
    "i use the rankine - hugoniot conditions to follow the evolution of the gas pressure , density and velocity along the flow . as in gs09 , i consider two limiting cases .",
    "first , i consider flows in which @xmath11 everywhere .",
    "second , i consider shocks in the which magnetic field is dynamically dominant , with @xmath38 , so that it dominates the pressure throughout the flow .",
    "when @xmath11 everywhere , the gas cools at an approximately constant pressure , and the final pressure far downstream is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the pressure immediately post - shock ( see section  2.3 in gs09 for details ) . in the limit of strong magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the rankine - hugoniot conditions imply constant density and velocity throughout the flow , so that @xmath41 , and @xmath42 everywhere .    to evaluate the intensity of the radiation along the flow , i follow the radiative transfer equation . as in gs09 ,",
    "i use a gaussian quadrature scheme ( chandrasekhar  1960 ) to evaluate the local intensity of radiation as a function of distance from the shock front .",
    "i follow the specific intensity @xmath43 along @xmath44 downstream directions between @xmath45 ( parallel to the shock velocity ) and @xmath46 .",
    "the flow is divided into thin slabs . in each slab",
    "i use cloudy to evaluate the local absorption ( @xmath47 ) and emission ( @xmath48 ) coefficients appropriate for the local conditions .",
    "the radiation transfer equation can then be followed along the @xmath44 values of @xmath49 , to calculate the input intensities for the next slab .",
    "finally the mean intensity , @xmath50 , is computed locally and used in evaluating the local heating and photoionization rates .",
    "the shock self - radiation also determines the ionization states in the radiative precursor , which in turn , affects the initial evolution of the post - shock gas . for shock velocities in excess of @xmath51  km  s@xmath6 such as",
    "i consider here , a stable radiative precursor will form ( gs09 ; dopita & sutherland  1996 ) .    in gs09",
    ", we allowed the shock to evolve until the gas cooled down to a temperature @xmath52  k , at which we terminated the computation . in this work ,",
    "i construct shock models as a function of the final shock age .",
    "the shock code used in this work does not produce truly time - evolving computations .",
    "instead , the evolution of the shock properties with age is approximated by a series of quasi - steady - state models , each assumed to be independent of other ages as described below .",
    "for each age , i terminate the computation once a lagrangian gas element starting at the shock front exists for a duration that equals the desired age . the shock structure , self - radiation , and the resulting precursor ionization , are then functions of this age .",
    "for each combination of shock parameters ( temperature , metallicity , and magnetic field ) i construct a series of such `` stand - alone '' self - consistent models for a range of ages .",
    "to self - consistently calculate the coupled ionization states in the precursor and the post - shock structure , iterations are required . in the first iteration",
    ", i assume that the gas starts in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) at the shock temperature .",
    "i then compute the resulting shock model , ending at the appropriate shock age , while following the radiative transfer in the downstream direction .    at early times , the shocks remain optically thin throughout . in this case , i assume that the flux at the termination point , @xmath53 equals the flux entering the radiative precursor .",
    "i use @xmath53 to compute the ionization states of the gas entering the shock . for older shocks",
    ", the gas becomes thick to its own self - radiation at some large distance from the shock front @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", i assume that the flux which ionizes the precursor equals @xmath55 . in both cases",
    "i use the photoionization code cloudy ( ver .",
    "07.02.00 ) to compute the equilibrium photoionization states in the steady precursor .",
    "these ionization states are the initial conditions for the next iteration .",
    "this process is repeated until the shock self - radiation and resulting initial ionization states converge .",
    "the assumption that the upstream radiation field equals @xmath55 ( or @xmath53 ) is based on the fact that the post - shock gas is optically thin in this region .",
    "nevertheless , geometrical effects as well as scatterings in the downstream gas , may increase the intensity of the radiation in upstream directions .",
    "this assumption may thus lead to some underestimate of the intensity of radiation photoionizing the precursor .    in gs09",
    ", we found that two iteration were sufficient to ensure the convergence of the complete ( steady - state ) shock models .",
    "however , for the younger partial shocks considered here , i find that more iterations are often required to obtain a self - consistent solution .",
    "the numerical scheme used here is identical to the one described in gs09 ( section  2.6 ) , with the exception of the different termination criterion . to ensure the convergence of the different models ,",
    "i have implemented an algorithm that automatically checks for convergence and initiates the next iteration if necessary .",
    "i found that between @xmath56 and @xmath57 iterations are required , depending on the shock parameters and age .",
    "the approximation used here , where the time - dependent structure of the shock is approximated by a series of quasi - static , `` self - contained '' models , introduces some inaccuracies . since the shock structure , self - radiation and associated precursor ionization states do , in fact ,",
    "evolve continuously over the lifetime of the shock , the discretizaton may lead to some error in the resulting structure of young shocks .",
    "however , as i demonstrate below , once the shocks exist for @xmath15 of their cooling times , the approximation is generally valid .",
    "in addition , this approximation does not significantly affect the computed self - radiation or resulting integrated column densities .    in the discussion that follows , all",
    "ages and times are presented in terms of @xmath58 , the post - shock hydrogen density times time .",
    "this scheme makes the results nearly independent of density ( but see section  3.5 in gs09 ) .",
    "in this section , i describe the shock structure , and focus on how it depends on the shock age .",
    "i consider two values of shock temperature : @xmath7  k ( @xmath59  km  s@xmath6 ) and @xmath8  k ( @xmath60  km  s@xmath6 ) , and five different values of the metallicity @xmath9 , from @xmath10 to @xmath56 times the metal abundance of the sun . for each shock temperature and gas metallicity",
    "i study shocks in the @xmath11 and strong-@xmath61 limits .      to illustrate the behavior of the post - shock cooling gas , i first focus on the results for a strong-@xmath61 shock with @xmath62  k , and @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ eg - ages - on - complete ] shows the temperature profile of the post - shock cooling layers for the complete shock .",
    "the crosses along the curve show the times for which partial shock models were computed .",
    "the complete shock ( figure  [ eg - ages - on - complete ] ) is composed of several zones ( gs09 ) .",
    "the photoionized precursor is heated to the shock temperatures after passing the shock front .",
    "it enters a `` hot radiative '' zone in which cooling is slow .",
    "it later passes through the `` nonequilibrium cooling '' zone , in which cooling is rapid , and departures from equilibrium ionization may occur .",
    "after the neutral ion fraction rises , photoabsorption heating becomes efficient , and the gas enters a `` photoabsorption plateau '' , during which the temperature declines more slowly . finally , after a cooling time , the gas cool completely .",
    "this picture is modified for time - dependent shocks that exist over a time - scale shorter than their cooling time .",
    "i now consider how the shock structure , self - radiation , and precursor ionization depend on the shock age .",
    "the initial ionization states of the gas that enters the shock are set by photoionization equilibrium of the precursor gas with the shock self - radiation .",
    "this radiation field builds up as the shock forms .",
    "initially , a young shock emits faint radiation , and the precursor gas remains largely neutral . as time passes , the shock self - radiation builds up until the final complete radiation field is obtained after a cooling time .",
    "even then , the photoionization equilibrium temperature in the radiative precursor is significantly lower than the shock temperature , and the gas remains underionized compared to cie at @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ rad - fields ] shows the radiation flux emitted by a @xmath7  k , solar metallicity shock at various ages .",
    "some age - labels are indicated near the spectra for guidance .",
    "initially , the precursor gas is almost entirely neutral , making electron impact excitations and thermal bremsstrahlung emission inefficient .",
    "the three bottom curves in figure  [ rad - fields ] show this initial stage , for which the precursor electron fraction is small ( @xmath65  @xmath66  s ) .",
    "after the radiation flux builds up as the shock develops , the ionized fraction in the precursor becomes significant .",
    "the various cooling and emission processes are then much more efficient , and the radiation field rises considerably . the radiation field continues to grow with shock age , because the depth of the emitting region increase with time ( @xmath67  @xmath66  s ) .",
    "finally , as the post - shock cooling layers become thick to the shock self - radiation , the radiation field entering the precursor stabilizes , and remains constant at later times .",
    "figure  [ rad - fields ] indeed shows that the radiation fields for older shocks nearly overlap ( and labels are therefore not shown for @xmath68  @xmath66  s ) .    in figure  [ u",
    "] , i show the ionization parameter that the shock self - radiation produces in the radiative precursor as a function of shock age .",
    "initially , the ionization parameter is very low , but it increases with shock age , until finally stabilizing at a value appropriate for the complete shock .",
    "figure  [ x0 ] shows the corresponding neutral fraction in the material entering the shock .",
    "initially ( @xmath69  @xmath66  s ) , the precursor gas is almost entirely neutral .",
    "the lack of free electrons leads to the initial inefficient radiation demonstrated in figure  [ rad - fields ] . at later times",
    ", the neutral fraction begins to decrease .",
    "first , both free electrons and neutral hydrogen coexist in the precursor gas , making initial cooling and emissivity in the post shock layers very efficient .",
    "as the depth of the radiating layers increases , hydrogen becomes mostly ionized , and the cooling efficiency of the post - shock layers drops again .",
    "it always remains higher that the cie cooling efficiency due to underionized metal species that are penetrating from the radiative precursor .",
    "the initial post - shock cooling rates as a function of age are displayed in figure  [ init_cool ] .",
    "this figure confirms that initially the lack of free electrons suppresses the cooling rate .",
    "the cooling rises as the electron fraction grows , until a maximal value is obtained when both neutral hydrogen atoms and free electrons are abundant in the gas entering the shock . at later times , as the gas become highly ionized , the abundance of efficient coolant decreases and the cooling rate declines again .",
    "the impact that this has on the shock structure is demonstrated in figure  [ tts ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the initial shock structure following the shock formation . as mentioned above ,",
    "initially the free electron fraction is negligible , and cooling is inefficient . with time , the electron fraction grows , and cooling becomes more efficient .",
    "for example , panel  ( a ) shows that the initial cooling at an age of @xmath70  @xmath66  s is more rapid than the cooling at @xmath71  @xmath66  s.    for these early ages , the gas remains neutral in the post - shock cooling layers , as the ionization time is longer than the shock age .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ xhiend ] , in which i show the _ final _ neutral hydrogen fraction , obtained at the maximum distance downstream from the shock front , as a function of the shock age .",
    "the figure shows that for ages @xmath72 , the gas remains partially neutral for the duration of the shock age . at later times ,",
    "two effects act to increase the final ionization .",
    "first , the shock age becomes longer than the ionization time - scale , and second the initial precursor neutral fraction declines .",
    "it is important to note that while the gas is being ionized , the self - radiation propagating upstream in the post - shock layers , which is not included in this computation , may affect the shock structure and ionization states .",
    "this only affects very young shocks ( panel  ( a ) in figure  [ tts ] ) , and therefore has little impact of the results presented in this paper .",
    "returning now to figure  [ tts ] . once a significant electron fraction is established , the cooling depends on the availability of coolants in the precursor gas .",
    "this phase is shown by the middle panel . for a shock age of @xmath73",
    "@xmath66  s , neutral hydrogen is abundant , and the initial cooling is very efficient , both due to collisional ionization and line cooling .",
    "this shock cools to a temperature of @xmath74  k within its life time . at later times , the shock self - radiation increases the ionization of the radiative precursor , and the initial post - shock cooling efficiency diminishes .",
    "the shortcomings of the quasi - static approximation are demonstrated in this panel . with the assumption that the age dependent structure may be approximated by a series of `` self - contained '' steady - states models , younger shocks cool to lower final temperatures than their older counterparts .",
    "for example , at an age of @xmath75  @xmath66  s , the shock only cools down to @xmath76  k. this inaccuracy in the temperature profile computations diminishes for older shocks , where the self - radiation and associated precursor ionization stabilize and are no longer a strong function of shock age . because the self - radiation depends more on the total age of the shock and on the metal abundance ( rather than on the details of the temperature profile ) , the computed self - radiation is not significantly affected by the quasi - static approximation . as i discuss below",
    ", the predicted column densities and resulting absorption line signatures are also independent of the quasi - static approximation .",
    "after @xmath77  @xmath66  s , the shock self - radiation approaches its maximal intensity , and at later times any additional contribution to the shock self - radiation is negligible .",
    "the initial ionization states of the gas in the radiative precursor then depend only weakly on the shock age , and no longer affect the dynamical evolution of the shock .",
    "this is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "the temperature profiles of all the shocks with ages larger than @xmath78  @xmath66  s overlap at early time .",
    "the arrows mark the ending points of partial shocks of various ages , and some labels are indicated near the arrows for guidance .      the gas metallicity affects the shock structure in two major ways ( gs09 ) .",
    "first , the metal content affects the cooling efficiency . for high - metallicity shocks , cooling is dominated by metal - line emission . for @xmath79",
    "k and @xmath80 , permitted transitions dominate the gas emission , and the cooling is roughly proportional to @xmath9 . at lower gas metallicities , cooling is dominated by hydrogen and helium . below @xmath81  k ,",
    "cooling is dominated by metal fine - structure transitions even at low metallicities .",
    "the cooling times are then always roughly proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "higher metallicity shocks therefore evolve more rapidly .",
    "the different cooling times also set the degree of non - equilibrium ionization in the cooling zone .",
    "departures from equilibrium ionization are therefore larger at higher metallicities .",
    "second , while the total energy emitted by the complete shock is independent of gas metallicity ( @xmath82 ) and is set by the input energy flux into the flow , the spectral energy distribution of the shock self - radiation is a strong function of gas metallicity .",
    "for low-@xmath9 , the radiation is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the resulting spectrum is therefore a smooth bremsstrahlung continuum , with very little features . at higher metallicities , the contribution of metal line emission increases",
    "this has a major effect on the shape of the emitted spectrum .",
    "for example , figure  [ rad - fields ] demonstrates that the emission of a @xmath62  k , solar metallicity shock is dominated by numerous metal emission lines .",
    "this affects both the downstream ion fractions ( for `` old '' enough shock ) and the ionization states in the radiative precursor .",
    "figure  [ uvsz ] shows how the changing spectral energy distribution affects the ionization parameter in the precursor gas .",
    "the different curves in figure  [ uvsz ] show the precursor ionization parameter for different gas metallicities , as indicated by the labels , as a function of shock age . at low metallicities ( grey curves )",
    "the ionization parameter is a simple power law in the shock age .",
    "this can be simply understood in terms of ionization by a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "the thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity at the shock temperature ( erg  s@xmath6  @xmath66 ) is given by , @xmath83 assuming that a layer with depth @xmath84 radiates with the above emissivity , the ionization parameter can be approximated by , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the initial post - shock velocity .",
    "this simple approximation is shown by the dotted line is figure  [ uvsz ] ( denoted `` ff '' ) .    the results for @xmath87 overlap with the predicted bremsstrahlung ionization parameter . however , higher metallicity shocks produce larger ionization parameters , as a large fraction of their initial energy flux is emitted via line emission at ionizing energies , and a smaller fraction is emitted as high - energy free - free photons .",
    "for example , the solar metallicity curve ( solid ) is higher by @xmath88 to @xmath56 dex compared with the bremsstrahlung predictions .",
    "this implies that the radiative precursor is more highly ionized at any age for higher metallicity shocks .",
    "the ionized faction , and implied initial cooling rates vary accordingly .      to study the impact of the shock temperature on the shock structure and evolution , i compare the results presented in section  [ structure - example ] for @xmath62  k with a model of a @xmath8  k shock .",
    "the overall characteristics of the hotter shock are similar to those discussed above .",
    "however , the shock temperature , and associated velocity , affect the initial energy content of the shock . hotter shocks therefore have longer overall cooling times . for example , in the @xmath8  k shock the initial temperature is @xmath44 times higher , and the velocity is @xmath89 times higher than in the @xmath7  k shock .",
    "the total energy flux input is therefore @xmath90 times larger .",
    "this affects the total cooling time of the shock .",
    "the emitted radiation field is also a strong function of the shock temperature .",
    "it is affected by the increased initial temperature . above @xmath91  k ,",
    "bremsstrahlung is the dominant emission process in cie even at high metallicities . in complete shocks",
    ", the thermal energy distribution is therefore dominated by a hard free - free continuum .",
    "this continuum extends to higher energies than for @xmath7  k , because the exponential cut - off occurs at higher temperatures .",
    "the spectrum is also considerably smoother , because a large fraction of the initial energy flux is emitted as bremsstrahlung continuum , and the intense line emission that occurs at lower temperatures as the gas cools only provides a small contribution .    for partial shocks , however",
    ", line emission may play a dominant role even at @xmath92  k shocks .",
    "figure  [ ts - rad ] shows the emitted radiation as a function of shock age for a @xmath8  k , solar metallicity shock in the strong-@xmath61 limit . after the gas becomes partially ionized ( @xmath93  @xmath66  s ) the increased availability of metal lines coolants produces a significant emission - line uv - bump in the resulting spectrum",
    "this is possible due to the highly underionized precursor that obtains at early times , before the full intensity of the shock self - radiation has accumulated . at later times , as the shock self - radiation efficiently ionizes the precursor gas , the fractional contribution of metal lines decrease , and a smoother spectrum is produced . for @xmath94",
    "@xmath66  s , the precursor gas is ionized , but the shocked - gas temperature is everywhere high enough to impede significant contribution of lines . at later times , at the gas cools in the post - shock flow , metal lines again contribute significantly to the emitted spectrum .",

    "the low metallicity results are again consistent with the predictions of the free - free continuum . however , as opposed to the results presented in section  [ structure - example ] for the @xmath7  k shock , figure  [ ts - u ] shows that for @xmath92  k , the late time ( age @xmath95  @xmath66  s ) results for high-@xmath9 are also nicely consistent with the bremsstrahlung expectations . as discussed above , this is because at high temperatures , a large faction of the initial energy is radiated as free - free emission , and the total contribution of metal emission lines is smaller . at early times ,",
    "when underionized gas rich with low - ionization species enters the shock front , the line contribution to the spectral energy distribution for high metallicity shocks remains significant .    for comparison ,",
    "the thick gray curve shows the results for a @xmath7  k shock .",

    "the most important difference is that when @xmath11 , the pressure remains nearly constant , and the density increases as the gas cools .",
    "since the cooling time is inversely proportional to the gas density , this implies rapidly decreasing cooling times ( fast cooling ) within the flow .",
    "the overall cooling times are much shorter , and in particular , the evolution below @xmath81  k is compressed into a very short time interval .",
    "the final evolution of @xmath11 shocks is affected not only by the shorter cooling times , but also by the difference in downstream ionization parameter , @xmath96 . for strong-@xmath61 shock ,",
    "the density in the flow is constant and the ionization parameters is @xmath97 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the density increases as the gas cools , and the ionization parameter is therefore @xmath98 , a factor @xmath99 smaller .",

    "the differences in the post - shock ionization structure at early ages , before much cooling took place , remain small .",
    "a second effect is related to the @xmath101 work that appears in @xmath11 shocks .",
    "the work done on the cooling gas implies that the overall emitted radiation is @xmath102 times larger for @xmath11 shocks than for isochoric shocks .",

    "this second dominant peak accumulates to a column density of @xmath149  @xmath106 for the complete shock .",
    "the post - shock column densities are unaffected by the quasi - static approximation , because the initial abundance peaks occur over a time scale shorter than the shock - age , and are therefore insensitive to the details of the temperature profile , whereas the second dominant abundance peaks are produces at late times within the nonequilibrium cooling zone and the photoabsorption plateau , when the quasi - static approximation robustly holds .",

    "first , higher metallicity gas cools more efficiently .",
    "this results in shorter cooling times , and in increased recombination lags .",
    "second , the spectral energy distribution of the shock self - radiation is dominated by line - produced uv - photons for high metallicity gas , and by a harder thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum for lower - z cases .",
    "photoionization is therefore more efficient in higher - metallicity shock , which produce larger ionization parameters ( see also figure  [ uvsz ] ) .    for the column density distributions shown in figures  [ post - ciii]-[post - neviii ]",
    ", a distinction must be made between the first and second abundance peaks discussed above .",
    "the first column peak is accumulated over an ionization time scale at the shock temperature .",
    "this ionization time - scale does not depend on the gas metallicity , and is barely affected by gas cooling , because little cooling occurs so rapidly .",
    "the integrated metal ion column densities are therefore simply proportional to the gas metallicity ( see equation  [ nprop ] ) .",

    "the strength of the magnetic field is one of the parameters that determines the significance of photoionization in the post - shock gas . in strong-@xmath61 shocks",

    "photoionization is therefore very important in strong-@xmath61 shocks , but does not play a significant role when @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the extent of the photoabsorption plateau is considerably shorter when @xmath11 , due to the faster cooling that takes place in the compressed gas .    as discussed above , equation  [ ngeneral ]",

    "this occurs at @xmath180  @xmath66  s. however , in the radiative precursor detectable amounts of are produced as early as @xmath181  @xmath66  s. this implies that there is a significant duration of time over which fast radiative shocks may be observed by means of their radiative precursor , even though the shocked gas itself was not able to cool , and therefore produces little observable signatures .",
    "a similar behavior is also observed for other gas metallicities , temperatures , and magnetic field properties .",
    "i conclude that intermediate and high ions produced in the radiative precursors of fast shock waves may serve as means for identifying and detecting young shocks that have not yet existed over a cooling time , and for which the shocked gas remains hot and difficult to observe .",
    "diagnostic diagrams for fast radiative shocks may be constructed using the computational data presented in sections  [ postcolumns ] and  [ precolumns ] . in figure",

    "the trajectories are only shown at ages for which the absolute column density is greater than @xmath186  @xmath106 .",
    "the left panel is for the columns produced in the post - shock cooling layers , and the right panel is for the radiative precursor .",
    "figure  [ eg - ratio ] shows that the ion ratios created in the radiative precursor may be very different from those which are produced in the post - shock gas . at early times ( @xmath187  @xmath66  s ) ,",
    "the column densities presented in figure  [ eg - ratio ] are completely dominated by the precursor columns . at later times",
    ", the post - shock cooling layers also contribute to the observed columns .",
    "as demonstrated above , the uv - absorption line signatures are dominated by photoionized gas in the radiative precursor over a significant fraction of the shock lifetime .",
    "ion - ratio diagrams , like the one shown in figure  [ eg - ratio ] , may serve as diagnostics for gas in the radiative precursors of incomplete , fast radiative shocks .",
    "the detection and identification of precursor gas may allow us to confirm the existence of hot , unobservable , shocked gas , and to infer the associated baryonic content .",
    "in this paper , i present theoretical computations of the metal - ion column densities produced in the post - shock cooling layers , and in the radiative precursors of fast astrophysical shocks as a function of shock age .",
    "my shock models rely upon the code and methods presented in gnat & sternberg  ( 2009 ; gs09 ) , but relax the assumption of steady - state complete shocks . to attain steady - state , the shocks must exist over time - scales that are long compared with their cooling times .",
    "otherwise the shock structure , emitted radiation and radiative precursors are a function of the shock age in the partially cooled shocks .",
    "i approximate the evolution of the shock properties by assuming quasi - static evolution . for a given shock ,",
    "as specified by the shock velocity , gas metallicity and magnetic field , i construct a series of models , each appropriate for a specific age , which are assumed to be independent of each other .    in these models ,",
    "i use and extend the shock code developed in gs09 .",
    "this code computes the time - dependent downstream ion fractions and cooling efficiencies , follows the radiative transfer of the shock self - radiation through the post - shock cooling layers , takes into account the resulting photoionization and heating rates , follows the one - dimensional dynamics of the flowing gas , and self - consistently computes the photoionization ion fractions in the radiative precursor .",
    "i follow the ion fractions of all ionization states of the elements h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe .",
    "i consider shock velocities of @xmath4 and @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 , associated with shock temperatures of @xmath7 and @xmath8  k , and gas metallicities between @xmath10 and @xmath56 times the heavy element abundance of the sun .    for the dynamical evolution",
    "i consider shocks with no magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) , for which the gas evolves with nearly constant pressure , with @xmath188 , where @xmath40 is the post - shock pressure .",
    "i also consider shocks in which the magnetic field is dynamically dominant everywhere ( @xmath38 ) so that the pressure is dominated by the magnetic field , and the density remains constant in the flow . when @xmath11 the gas is compressed and decelerated as is cools .",
    "the increased density implies faster cooling , and the low - temperature evolution is significantly faster when @xmath11 compared with the strong-@xmath61 limit . in section  [ physics ] , i describe the equations that i solve , and the numerical method used to compute the shock properties .    in section  [ structure",
    "] , i investigate the shock structure , and focus on how it depends on the shock age .",
    "complete shocks are composed of several zones , through which the gas flows .",
    "the precursor gas enters the hot radiative zone , in which the gas is hot and cooling is inefficient . after a significant fraction of the shock input energy is radiated , the temperature finally declines , allowing the cooling rate to increase .",
    "the gas then goes through the nonequilibrium cooling zone , in which cooling is very efficient , and recombination lags may occur .",
    "once the neutral fraction rises , photoabsorption becomes efficient , and the gas enters a photoabsorption plateau in which the temperature profile is shallower , until finally all self - radiation is absorbed and the gas cools completely . in partial , time - dependent shocks , this classical picture is modified due to the finite shock age . the shock structure , self - radiation and precursor ionization",
    "then depend on the shock age .",
    "the shock self - radiation accumulates over time , as deeper downstream layers contribute to the emitted radiation .",
    "initially , the self - radiation of young shocks is faint , leading to low ionization parameters and large neutral fractions in their radiative precursors . in this case , the post - shock free electron abundance is small , leading to inefficient excitation and ionization in the downstream gas . as the intensity of the self - radiation increases , the neutral fraction in the radiative precursor diminishes . at this stage ,",
    "both free electrons and neutral hydrogen atoms are abundant in the gas entering the hot radiative zone .",
    "cooling due to both collisional ionization and ly@xmath189 emission is highly efficient under these conditions . finally , once the shock self - radiation is intense enough to fully ionize the precursor hydrogen gas , the initial cooling drops again due to the lack of efficient coolants .",
    "even then , cooling remains large compared with cie , due to the underionized metal species that exist in the radiative precursor .    as expected",
    ", the ionization parameter in the radiative precursor increases monotonically with shock age as the shock self - radiation builds up .",
    "after the shock exists for a cooling time , the intensity of this radiation stabilizes at a value appropriate for the complete shock .",
    "i find that the precursor ionization parameter is a strong function of gas metallicity . for low metallicities ,",
    "the shock self - radiation is composed almost entirely of thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the precursor ionization parameter is then a simple power law in the shock age .",
    "however , for larger metallicities , a significant fractions of the shock self - radiation is emitted as metal - lines , creating a `` uv - bump '' in the spectral energy distribution .",
    "the contribution of the metal - line emission enhances the ionization parameter , which may be between @xmath88 and @xmath56 dex larger than the bremsstrahlung value .",
    "hotter shocks emit a larger fraction of their input energy as thermal bremsstrahlung even at high metallicities , and their ionization parameters are closer to the free - free values .    in sections",
    "[ example - columns]-[postcolumns ] , i present computations of the integrated metal - ion column densities in the post - shock cooling layers .",
    "i examine how the downstream column densities evolve with time .",
    "i list the complete set of post - shock column densities in table  [ post - table ] , as outlined in table  [ guide ] .",
    "for uv - detectable ions ( , , etc . )",
    ", the column densities are composed of two distinct contributions .",
    "first , some column density is initially created over a very short time scale ( an ionization time - scale ) , as the underionized gas in the precursor approaches cie at the shock temperature .",
    "this column density builds over a time scale which is orders of magnitudes shorter than the cooling time , and later remains constant as the shock evolves . for example , for the initial column density in a @xmath7  k , @xmath63",
    ", strong-@xmath61 shock is @xmath105",
    "it accumulates over a time scale of @xmath190  @xmath66  s , and later remains constant for a few @xmath191  @xmath66  s. a second , dominant peak is later created as the shocked gas cools and recombines through the nonequilibrium cooling zone and the photoabsorption plateau . in the example above , the second peak yields a column density of @xmath192  @xmath106 , which is the column observed in a complete shock .",
    "the initial peaks produce very low column densities which are difficult to observe .",
    "the columns in these initial peaks are roughly proportional to gas metallicity .",
    "the second dominant peak depends on the gas metallicity in a more complicated manner , related to the dominant coolants at various temperatures .",
    "the initial peaks are also insensitive to the value of the magnetic field , as they are created on an ionization time - scale over which very little evolution in the thermal and dynamical properties of the gas takes place .",
    "however , the second dominant peaks are strongly affected by the magnetic field .",
    "when @xmath11 , the compression and associated accelerated cooling lead to significant suppression of intermediate and low ions created at low temperatures compared with constant - density , strong-@xmath61 shocks .",
    "high - ions , which are created at or near the shock temperature , do not depend on the value of the magnetic field .",
    "uv observations of shocked gas , and in particular the ratio of high to intermediate ions , may be used to probe the intensity of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields in complete fast shocks .    in section  [ precolumns ] , i compute the precursor column densities for the various shock models as functions of shock age .",
    "as expected , the column densities of the intermediate and high ions are monotonically increasing functions of the shock age .",
    "they grow as the intensity of the shock self - radiation accumulates with time , leading to more highly - ionized , deeper upstream absorption layers .",
    "i list the full set of precursor column densities in table  [ pre - table ] , as outlined in table  [ guide ] .",
    "i find that the precursor column densities of intermediate and low ions dominate the observable signatures from fast shocks over a significant fraction of the shock cooling time .    as opposed to the column densities created in the downstream cooling layers , the precursor column densities are insensitive to the value of the magnetic field .",
    "because the shock self - radiation is dominated by emission in the hot radiative zone , in which no significant cooling takes place , the ionization parameter and spectral energy distributions are similar for strong-@xmath61 shocks and for shock in which @xmath11 .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate that over extended periods of time , the precursor produces observable amounts of intermediate and high ions , such as , , and .",
    "these precursor uv signatures may be the only means to detect and identify the existence of young fast shocks . for example , in a @xmath7  k , solar metallicity shock in the strong-@xmath61 limit , readily detectable amounts of ( @xmath179  @xmath106 ) are only produced in the post - shock cooling layers at very late times , at ages @xmath193  @xmath66  s. however , in the radiative precursor similar amounts of are produced as early as @xmath181  @xmath66  s.    finally , in section  [ diagnostics ] , i demonstrate how ion - ratio diagrams may serve as diagnostics for gas in the radiative precursors of partially - cooled fast astrophysical shocks .",
    "this provides a mean to observationally identify the precursors of young fast shocks .",
    "i suggest that the detection and identification of precursor gas , photoionized by the hard shock self - radiation , may allow us to confirm the existence of the hot , unobservable , shocked counterpart .",
    "absolute calibration of the observed precursor column densities may then be used to infer the shocked - gas column , and estimate the `` missing '' baryonic mass associated with the shocks .",
    "shock waves are a common phenomenon in astrophysics , and have a profound impact on the energetics and distribution of gas in the interstellar and intergalactic medium . in this paper ,",
    "i present theoretical computations of the metal - ion column densities produced in the post - shock cooling layers , and in the radiative precursors of fast astrophysical shocks as a function of shock age .",
    "this work is motivated by recent uv and x - ray observations of gas that may be a part of a @xmath0  k `` warm / hot intergalactic medium '' ( e.g.  tripp et al .  2007 ; savage et al .",
    "2005 ; buote et al .  2009 ; narayanan et al .",
    "2009 ; fang et al .  2010",
    "; danforth et al .  2010 ) .",
    "however , the results presented here are also applicable to other astrophysical environments in which young shocks are expected to prevail , including supernovae remnants and active galactic nuclei .",
    "the whim application is particularly interesting , because the warm / hot intergalactic medium is expected to be a major reservoir of baryons ( e.g.  cen & ostriker  1999 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 ; bertone et al .",
    "2008 ) , and in fact account for the so - called `` missing baryons '' in the low - redshift universe .    in my numerical models , the time - evolution of the shock structure , self - radiation , and",
    "associated metal - ion column densities are computed by a series of quasi - static models , each appropriate for a different shock age .",
    "the results for the post - shock and precursor columns are presented in convenient online format in tables  [ post - table ] and  [ pre - table ] . for the post - shock columns ,",
    "i use a shock code that explicitly follows the nonequilibrium ionization states in the post - shock cooling layer , taking into account the impact of the shock self - radiation , cooling , and gas dynamics .",
    "the precursor columns are set by photoionization equilibrium with the shock self - radiation , which depends on the shock parameters and age .",
    "the shock models presented here are applicable to the shock - heated warm / hot intergalactic medium , and may provide a way to identify and measure some of the missing baryonic mass .",
    "my computations indicate that readily observable amounts of intermediate and high ions , such as , , and are created in the precursors of young shocks , for which the shocked gas remains hot and difficult to observe ( as in the whim ) .",
    "i suggest that such precursors may provide a way to identify whim shocks : the absorption - line signatures predicted here may be used to construct ion - ratio diagrams ( e.g. figure  [ eg - ratio ] ) , which will serve as diagnostics for the photoionized gas in the precursors .",
