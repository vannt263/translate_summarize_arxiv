    "relaxation and decoherence properties in electronic devices such as low - dimentional structures and specifically in quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted the interest of experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "fabricated coupled qds have been suggested as candidates for quantm bits ( qubits ) where the states of a single trapped electron within the coupled qds can perform the two states of the qubit.@xcite the investigated devices are mainly characterized by two important decoherence channels .",
    "the first one is the coulomb interaction to the background charge fluctuation which is an extrinsic decoherence and the second channel , an intrinsic decoherence , due to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the theoretical studies of the above mentioned intrinsic decoherence due to single elctron - phonon coupling are mainly related to the single phonon emission process .",
    "although the electron relaxation through multi phonon processes is an important parameter at high temperature , at qubits operation temprature ( @xmath0 1 t ) these processes have not strong effects .",
    "@xcite    it is worth mentioning that the last decade a vast of research has been published on double qds dephasing @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we have reported the results of charge decoherence due to relaxation and dephasing rates caused by electron - phonon interaction . in the present investigation ,",
    "we report the significance of longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons ( including the deformation and piezoelectric interactions ) and lo phonons on relaxation and dephasing rates in laterally coupled qds under the existence of magnetic fields .",
    "the existence of an external magnetic field is of special importance for the electron states@xcite due to the decrease of electron energy splitting as the magnetic field increases .",
    "the scattering rates have been found to depend strongly on electron confinement and the interdot distance .",
    "acoustic phonons are only used in the calculations of the relaxation rate due to the small electron energy splitting ( @xmath11mev ) .",
    "for the dephasing rates , both the acoustic and optical phonons are considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the electron wavefunctions under the present of an external magnetic field and the models for the acoustical and optical phonon modes . in section iii",
    ", we outline the scattering theory of an electron which is scattered to an energetically smaller state by the emission of acoustical phonons .",
    "the dephasing rates have been also studied by considering the emission of acoustical and optical phonons .",
    "section iv is devoted to the numerical results and interpretation of suppression of decoherence due to magnetic field .",
    "lastly , section v presents a summary of the present work .",
    "we consider a single electron within two coupled identical qds with an interdot distance @xmath2 .",
    "the lateral electron motion is decoupled from the one along the qw growth .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian which describes the single electron motion which is confined in laterally coupled qds is given by @xmath3 where the qw growth is denoted by the subscript @xmath4 and the lateral direction by @xmath5 .",
    "the external magnetic field enters the hamiltonian via a magnetic vector potential @xmath6 . by choosing the symmetric gauge @xmath7",
    "then the magnetic field points to @xmath8 direction and it is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the lateral confinement is assumed to be parabolic for a single qd , therefore , the hamiltonian operator for the lateral directions has been considered as @xcite @xmath10 where the operator of the @xmath8 component of the angular momentum is given by @xmath11\\ ] ] with @xmath12 the quantum mechanical operator of momentum , @xmath13 is a parameter ( in this case frequency ) describing the strength of the confinement in x - y plane , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the electron wavefunction can be separated to the following envelope functions , @xmath16 in the case of a single qd , the one electron wavefunction can be given in terms of the principal quantum number @xmath17 @xmath18 and the angular momentum quantum number @xmath19 @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the laguerre polynomials , and @xmath23 is a scaled radius , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the single particle are given by @xmath26 by using the heaviside step function @xmath27 , the hamiltonian , along the qw growth , takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electron effective mass and @xmath30 the offset between the band edges well and barrier .",
    "the wavefunction along the above mentioned direction has been considered as the wavefunction of an infinite qw @xmath31 . here",
    ", it has been used only the ground state wavefunction along the qw growth due to the strong confinement along this direction .",
    "the ground state wavefunction is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a coefficient to be determined by normalization and @xmath34 is the size of the qw .",
    "the wavefunction of a single electron which is confined in a 2d qd and is coupled in one dimension of the x - y plane , can be formed by superposition of two uncoupled qds which are sited `` left '' and `` right '' of the the origin of the frame of reference and are separated by an inter - dot distance @xmath2 .",
    "the external confining potential which it is used is given by @xmath35 the single electron wavefunction for the parallel plane can be given by : @xmath36 and the total wavefunction of the system of coupled qds as described above is @xmath37 the wavefunctions in the parallel plane of the coupled qds system are calculated numerically by direct diagonalization .",
    "the electrons , in polar semiconductors couple to acoustical and optical phonons .",
    "the small electron energy splitting does not permit any electron transition in the charge qubit via the emission of optical phonons .",
    "on the other hand , the acoustical phonons contribute to the relaxation rates due to the small phonon energies . here",
    ", we calculate the decohence rates which are caused due deformation potential and piezoelectric acoustic phonon interaction by considering only longitudinal phonons .",
    "it follows the hamiltonian which describes these interactions @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the frequency of the phonon mode with wavevector @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the mass density of the host material , @xmath42 is the volume of the sample , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are phonon annihilation and creation operators , and @xmath45 is the electron density operator .",
    "the term @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 the first term of the above equation represents the deformation potential interaction with deformation potential d and the second part , which is imaginary , is the piezoelectric interaction . @xcite for zincblende crystals ( e.g. gaas )",
    ", the term @xmath48 can get the form @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the electronic charge , @xmath51 is the piezoelectric constant , and @xmath52 is the unit polarization vector .",
    "the fact that the energy difference between the electron states in coupled quantum dots is quite small ( a few mev ) does not allow optical phonon transitions due to the conservation of energy ( optical phonon energy is @xmath0 36 mev in gaas ) .",
    "the optical phonons play a role in dephasing rates as we demonstrate in the next section . by using the bulk phonon approximation and neglecting the interface phonon modes @xcite",
    ", the electron - phonon interaction due to lo phonons is thus given by @xcite @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the longitudinal optical frequency , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the static and high frequency dielectric constant of the host material .",
    "having described the electronic states in coupled qds and the relevant types of phonon , we are now ready to calculate the relaxation and dephasing rates .",
    "the next section is devoted to fermi s golden rule and dephasing rates .",
    "the relaxation rate between an initial @xmath58 and a final state @xmath59 associated with phonon emission ( + ) ( or absorption ( - ) ) is determined by fermi s golden rule : @xmath60 where the labels ` i ' and f denote the initial and final electron states respectively .",
    "@xmath61 is the bose - einstein distribution function for phonons with lattice temperature @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in our calculations we assumed @xmath63 and the phonon absorption can be neglected .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that relaxation is not the only way charge qubits can be decohered .",
    "if the energy difference between the two charge states fluctuates , phase information will get lost and decoherence occurs .",
    "the density operator of an electron in a boson bath is given in @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy splitting between the electron energy levels .",
    "in short , pure dephasing cause a decay in the off - diagonal element of the density matrix for the two - level system that makes up the charge qubit @xcite : @xmath66 where the exponent function @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 for acoustic phonons , we choose frequencies @xmath69 for the relevant branches , while for longitudinal optical phonons , we choose @xmath70 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath71 due to deformation potential , piezoelectric and optical phonons are respectively given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 the symbols @xmath75 refer to the two states for the double dot charge qubit .",
    "the matrix integrals in this study are carried out using the monte - carlo algorithms .",
    "we firstly calculate the relaxation rates as a function of an external magnetic field @xmath76 , for an electron which scatters from the first excited to ground state associated by the emission of acoustical phonons . in all our calculations ,",
    "the quantum well width is fixed to the value of @xmath77 and the confinement lengths in the x an y directions are @xmath78 .    as it appears in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , for small magnetic field the relaxation rates due to deformation interaction is larger than the one due to piezoelectric interaction .",
    "as the field @xmath76 increases the piezoelectric coupling becomes the dominate contributor due to the different wavevector dependence in the deformation and piezoelectric matrix elements .",
    "for the deformation potential , the dependence of matrix elements on wavevector is related to @xmath79 while for the piezoelectric coupling is related to @xmath80 .",
    "the relaxation rates for small magnetic field increase up to a maximum value and afterwards decrease .",
    "this resonance reflects the existence of large electron wavefunctions of the charge qubit ( for @xmath813  tesla ) .",
    "[ fig_2 ] presents the electron relaxation rates as a function the half the interdot distance for a fixed @xmath82 tesla and @xmath83 . as the interdot distance increases the rates decrease due to the small energy splitting which results small phonon density of states .",
    "thus the relaxation rates become small as the interdot distance increases . for @xmath84 close to @xmath85 , it is obvious that the rates get a maximum value due to large wavefunctions . the different dependence of matrix elements on the phonon wavefuction for the deformation potential and piezoelectric interaction",
    "results the different behavior of the relaxation rates for the above mentioned interactions .",
    "the dependence of the relaxation rates on the electron confinement strength is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "the rates increase as the energy splitting between the first excited and ground state increases .",
    "when the electron strength of the electron confinement reaches the value @xmath86 mev , the relaxation rates get a maximum value . increasing the electron confinement strength ,",
    "the energy splitting becomes small and the relaxation rates decrease as a consequence of the energy splitting degradation .",
    "the dependence of relaxation rates on the energy splitting is shown in inset [ fig_3 ] . which reflects the fact that for a given energy splitting , correspond two values of the strength of the confinement .",
    "@xcite as a result there are two values of relaxation rates for each energy splitting .",
    "the two different types of electron - phonon interactions produce different contribution to the total relaxation rates and can be interpreted in the same manner as in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the second part of our investigation of decoherence in charge qubits is the evaluation of dephasing factor and its dependence on an external magnetic field . here",
    ", we calculate the dephasing effects from both acoustic ( deformation , piezoelectric ) and optical phonons .",
    "[ fig_4 ] shows the temporal dependence for two different values of an external magnetic field .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] rapidly increase for the first 10 ps and and for later times they saturate . as a result @xmath67 depends only very slowly on time after 100  ps .",
    "the interaction between the qubit electron and the acoustic phonon bath causes the fast increasing of dephasing in a period of time less than 100  ps .",
    "mathematically , the very fast time dependence of dephasing is due to the trigonometric dependence on phonon frequencies and time [ see ref .  ] . for larger time is practically flat and can be considered constant after 100  ps .",
    "a constant dephasing factor will not produce a decaying signal in terms of , for example , oscillations in electrons .",
    "instead , it simply reduces the contrast in the charge oscillation .",
    "this can be seen easily from eq .",
    "[ density_matrix ] .",
    "the presence of a constant @xmath87 simply reduces the magnitude of @xmath88 by a constant factor of 0.05 , which is not a particularly large suppression ( though significant in terms of fault tolerant quantum computing ) .",
    "the temporal behavior of the dephasing factor has an interesting feature for zero and a none zero magnetic field .",
    "@xmath67 decreases as @xmath76 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig_4]a , b ) due to the dependence of the matrix elements on the initial and final wavefunctions under the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "[ fig_5 ] shows the dephasing rates as a function of an external magnetic field . as the field @xmath76 increases the quantity @xmath73 in eq.([i_q ] )",
    "decreases as a consequence of the smaller differences in the matrix elements involved in eq .",
    "( [ i_q ] ) . for large magnetic fields",
    "the rates go to zero .",
    "finally , we calculate the dephasing rates as a function of the half the interdot distance for a fixed external magnetic field and electron confinement strength . as in the case of the relaxation rates ,",
    "the dephasing rates decrease by increasing the interdot distance due to the fact that when the two qds are well separated then the integral difference in eq.([i_q ] ) goes down quickly .",
    "consequently , the dephasing factor @xmath67 undergoes suppression by increasing the separation distance .",
    "we have studied the phonon - induced single electron relaxation and dephasing rates in laterally coupled qds with the presence of an external magnetic field . the relaxation and dephasing rates",
    "have been calculated for different system parameters such as interdot distance , strength of electron confinement and magnetic field . in the case of zero magnetic field @xcite",
    ", the rates could be enhanced for some double dot configurations .",
    "this enhancement of the rates could be easily suppressed by the existence of an external magnetic field .",
    "our results show that the magnetic field is of crucial importance in the study the decoherence in charge qubits due to the suppression of electron relaxation and dephasing rates .",
