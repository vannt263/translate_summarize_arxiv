    "their mass composition is still not known exactly , and without this knowledge it is difficult to understand the character of nuclear interactions in this energy region .",
    "muons with energy near @xmath7  gev are very important component of eas .",
    "they are poorly moderated in the atmosphere , are sensitive to the characteristics of nuclear interactions during development of a shower and to the chemical composition of cosmic rays ( cr ) . due to their yield and properties of lateral distribution",
    "they can be effectively registered with widely spaced ground arrays . since 1978 yakutsk eas array has been continuously registering muons with the threshold energy @xmath8  gev . during this period",
    "a large amount of experimental data has been accumulated .",
    "analysis of this material  @xcite has revealed that the development of showers with @xmath9  ev differs significantly from those at lesser energies of cr .",
    "it also allowed us to estimate the fraction of primary gamma - quanta in the total cr flux at energies above @xmath10  ev  @xcite .",

    "this was accompanied by near simultaneous variations in the energy spectrum and in the global anisotropy of cr within energy range @xmath17  ev  @xcite .",
    "after 1996 , during the next 7 years , the integral intensity of cr at @xmath18  ev increased by @xmath19% and then started declining .",
    "as for the phase of the first harmonic @xmath20 and its amplitude @xmath21 sampled during 1983 - 1994 , they changed to values @xmath22 and @xmath23 during 1998 - 2010 . in recent years , a tendency has been manifested towards the change of these values in the opposite direction .",
    "it seems like the effect of some gargantuan explosion which have contributed a significant portion of heavy nuclei to the background .",
    "it s difficult to pinpoint exactly what kind of event in the galaxy could led to such result . here",
    "we need further studies involving temporal factor of the experimental data .    in this work we present the results of analyzes of muon data with @xmath8  gev threshold collected during the period from november 2011 to june 2013 .",

    "the relation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) unambiguously connects the @xmath35 with @xmath36 at any given cr composition .",

    "it shows that within the framework of any shower development model , between the depth of maximum @xmath87 and the logarithm of muon density normalized to @xmath36 , there is a quasi - linear dependence at any composition of primary particles : @xmath89 if one inserts ( [ eq:13 ] ) into ( [ eq:12 ] ) , then ( [ eq:10 ] ) follows .",

    "estimations of the mean cr mass composition from fig.[fig:4 ] obtained within the frameworks of these models are close enough to worldwide data  @xcite .",
    "the qgsjetii-04 model agrees with them better than qgsjet01d .",
    "our data displayed on fig.[fig:4 ] have added to the whole picture that testifies of a rapid change in the cr composition towards lighter nuclei in energy range @xmath92  ev .",
    "it can not be ruled out that at @xmath93 there is a peak of local heaviness of cr composition .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig:5 ] that ldfs obtained from simulations are well - described by the approximation ( [ eq:8 ] ) within a wide range of distances from shower axis .",
    "this approximation is convenient for comparison between the experimental data and theoretical predictions as seen on fig.[fig:3]*(b)*. fig.[fig:6 ] suggests that muon component contains some possibilities yet to discover . in particular",
    ", it allows to relatively easy determine the depth of maximum eas development ( see fig.[fig:7 ] ) .",
