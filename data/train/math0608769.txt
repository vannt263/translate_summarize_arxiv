    "consider the collection of all @xmath0multisets over the universe @xmath5=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] . a universal cycle ( ucycle ) on multisets is a cyclic string @xmath6 with @xmath7 $ ] for which the collection @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 is precisely the collection of all @xmath0multisets over @xmath5 $ ]",
    ", i.e. each @xmath0multiset over @xmath5 $ ] occurs precisely once in the above collection . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", the term universal cycle will refer to universal cycles on multisets unless noted otherwise .",
    "universal cycles do not exist for every value of @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , simple symmetry arguments show that each of the numbers @xmath12 must occur an equal number of times in the ucycle .",
    "since the length of the ucycle is equal to the number of @xmath0multisets over @xmath5 $ ] , which is @xmath13 , we must have that @xmath14 while this condition is necessary , it is not sufficient for the existence of ucycles .    to date , the bulk of research on ucycles has been devoted to studying ucycles over sets ( as opposed to multisets ) .",
    "ucycles over sets are constructed in the same fashion as ucycles over multisets , except that we consider the collection of all @xmath0sets over @xmath5 $ ] instead of the collection of all @xmath0multisets , and our divisibility condition becomes @xmath15 . in @xcite , chung , diaconis and graham conjectured that for each value of @xmath0 , there exists a number @xmath16 such that universal cycles exist for @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in @xcite ,",
    "hurlbert consolidated and extended previous work , verifying the conjecture for @xmath19 and @xmath20 and developing partial results for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in @xcite ,",
    "godbole et al .  considered universal cycles over multisets for the case @xmath19 , and verified the analogous form of the chung ",
    "diaconis  graham conjecture ( i.e. with the modified divisibility criterion ) for this case .",
    "this work is of particular interest because godbole et al .",
    "used a new inductive technique to arrive at their proof , and in this paper we extend this technique to the case @xmath4 .",
    "this new work suggests that the inductive method is a promising way of addressing the chung  diaconis  graham conjecture .",
    "we also consider a second proof of the conjecture for the @xmath4 multiset case , which builds off universal cycles on sets and lends itself more easily to generalization .",
    "for @xmath4 , the condition @xmath23 implies that @xmath24 or @xmath25 ( mod 3 ) .",
    "we will consider the case @xmath26 ( mod 3 ) , as the other case can be dealt with similarly .",
    "we will show that for @xmath27 , universal cycles exist whenever @xmath3 satisfies @xmath23    before describing the proof itself , we will define some terminology that will be useful for describing universal cycles .",
    "we say that a cyclic string @xmath6 _ contains _ the multiset collection @xmath28 if @xmath29 , where each of these sets must be distinct",
    ". clearly @xmath30 , since this is the number of @xmath20multisets on @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "for a string @xmath6 , we call the _ lead - in _ of @xmath31 the substring @xmath32 and the _ lead - out _ the substring @xmath33",
    ".    now , consider the collection of all 3multisets over @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "we shall partition this collection into four subcollections .",
    "let @xmath34 be the collection of all 3multisets over @xmath35 $ ] , and let @xmath36 be the collection of all @xmath20multisets over @xmath37 and @xmath38 $ ] which contain at least one element from @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the collection of all 3multisets with one or two elements from @xmath40 and one or two elements from @xmath37 , and let @xmath41 be the collection of all 3multisets with one element from each of @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath40 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we can see that @xmath42 and @xmath41 are disjoint , and that their union is the collection of all 3multisets on @xmath5 $ ] , as desired .",
    "now , let @xmath43 be a universal cycle on @xmath38 $ ] , and since @xmath44 must occur somewhere in @xmath43 and the beginning of @xmath43 is arbitrary , we shall have @xmath43 begin with @xmath44 .",
    "we shall also select @xmath43 so that its lead - out is @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath43 , when considered as a cyclic string , contains all @xmath20multisets over @xmath38 $ ] , and when considered as a non - cyclic string , contains all @xmath20multisets except @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a string over @xmath35 $ ] such that @xmath49the concatenation of @xmath43 and @xmath48is a universal cycle over @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "it is not clear that such a @xmath48 must exist , but we shall find a specific example shortly . in the example we will find , @xmath48 will begin with @xmath50 and will end with @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath48 begins with @xmath50 , the string @xmath49 contains the multisets @xmath52 .",
    "we can see that the cyclic string @xmath49 contains all of the multisets in @xmath34 , and that when @xmath49 is considered as a non - cyclic string , it contains @xmath53 .",
    "now , consider the string @xmath54 obtained by taking @xmath48 and replacing each instance of @xmath55 by @xmath56 , @xmath57 by @xmath58 , and @xmath59 by @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath48 contained all multisets over @xmath35 $ ] which contained at least one element from @xmath40 , we have that @xmath54 contains all multisets over @xmath37 and @xmath38 $ ] which contain at least one element from @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath54 contains all the multisets in @xmath36 .",
    "since the lead - in of @xmath48 is @xmath50 , the lead - in of @xmath54 is also @xmath50 , and since @xmath48 ends with @xmath51 , @xmath54 ends with @xmath60 .",
    "if we consider the cyclic string @xmath61 , we can see that this string contains all the multisets in @xmath62 , while the non - cyclic version of this string is missing the multisets @xmath63 .    for notational convenience",
    ", we will use the following assignments : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "now , consider the following string :    @xmath66    we can see that this string contains every multiset in @xmath41 , as well as the multisets @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . now",
    ", the following string ( found with the aid of a computer ) contains all of the multisets in @xmath71 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath72 : @xmath73    note that while the multisets @xmath74 and @xmath75 are not present in the above string @xmath76 , they are present in the concatenation of @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , while @xmath76 does not contain @xmath78 and @xmath79 , these multisets are present in the concatenation of @xmath54 with @xmath76 .",
    "now , we can see that the string @xmath80 is a universal cycle over @xmath5 $ ] because the non - cyclic string @xmath61 contained all the multisets in @xmath81 , and it is precisely the multisets @xmath82 and @xmath83 which are obtained by the wrap - around of the lead - out of @xmath77 with the lead - in of @xmath43 . the lead - in and lead - out of the other strings has been engineered so as to ensure that each multiset occurs precisely once .",
    "this completes the induction proof , since the string @xmath49 is a universal cycle over @xmath35 $ ] ( taking the place of @xmath43 in the previous iteration of the induction ) , and the string @xmath84 extends this cycle to @xmath5 $ ] ( taking the place of @xmath48 in the previous iteration of the induction ) .",
    "also note that @xmath84 begins with @xmath50 and ends with @xmath60 , as required for the induction hypothesis .",
    "thus , all that remains is the find a base case from which the induction can proceed . a possible base case",
    "( there are many ) for @xmath85 is @xmath86 which would lead to @xmath87 where `` 0 '' denotes 10 and the spacings have been added to increase readability .",
    "all of the work up to this point has dealt with @xmath88 ( mod 3 ) .",
    "the proof for @xmath89 ( mod 3 ) is similar , so it has been omitted for the sake of brevity .",
    "in this proof , we construct a ucycle on 3multisets of @xmath5 $ ] by modifying a ucycle on 3subsets of @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "( we know from @xcite that ucycles on 3subsets of @xmath5 $ ] exist for all @xmath90 not divisible by @xmath20 . ) before giving the proof , we introduce two terms .",
    "we call each element of @xmath5 $ ] a _ letter _ , and each @xmath91 in the ucycle @xmath92 a _ character_. to summarize , a ucycle on 3multisets of @xmath5 $ ] is made up of @xmath13 characters , each of which equals one of @xmath3 letters .",
    "to demonstrate the proof s technique , we will first use an argument similar to it to create ucycles on 2multisets from ucycles on 2subsets .",
    "we start with this ucycle on 2subsets of @xmath93 $ ] : @xmath94 then , we repeat the first instance of every letter to create the following ucycle on 2multisets : @xmath95 the technique works because repeating a character @xmath91 as above adds the multiset @xmath96 to the ucycle and has no other effect .    to use this technique on ucycles on 3subsets , we repeat not single characters , but pairs of characters . for example , changing @xmath97 to @xmath98 has only has the effect of adding the 3multisets @xmath99 and @xmath100 to the cycle . in order to use this technique",
    ", we will need to know which consecutive pairs of letters appear in a ucycle on 3subsets .",
    "for instance , the following ucycle ( generated using methods from @xcite ) on 3subsets of @xmath101 $ ] contains every unordered pair of letters as consecutive characters but @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 : @xmath106 ( the spaces in the cycle are added only for readability . ) this ucycle is missing 4 pairs , which happens to be @xmath107 .",
    "this is no coincidence : in fact , this is the most pairs that a ucycle on 3subsets can fail to contain .",
    "no two unordered pairs not appearing as consecutive characters in a ucycle on 3subsets have a letter in common .",
    "a ucycle can hence be missing at most @xmath107 pairs of letters .",
    "suppose that we have a ucycle on 3subsets that contains neither @xmath108 and @xmath109 as consecutive characters , nor @xmath108 and @xmath110 as consecutive characters , where @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "then the ucycle does not contain the 3subset @xmath112 , for all permutations of @xmath112 contain either @xmath108 and @xmath109 consecutively , or @xmath108 and @xmath110 consecutively . but this is a contradiction , as a ucycle by definition contains all 3subsets .",
    "hence , no two pairs of characters missing in the ucycle can have a letter in common . by the pigeonhole principle",
    ", the ucycle can be missing at most @xmath107 pairs of letters .    with this lemma",
    ", we can finish our proof , creating a ucycle on 3multisets of @xmath5 $ ] whenever @xmath3 is not divisible by 3 .",
    "first , we consider the case when @xmath3 is even .",
    "let @xmath31 be a ucycle on 3subsets of @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath113 be a permutation of @xmath5 $ ] such that    * @xmath114 equals the first character in @xmath31 . *",
    "@xmath115 equals the last character in @xmath31 . *",
    "the list @xmath116 contains all unordered pairs of letters not contained as consecutive characters in @xmath31 , which is possible by our lemma .",
    "( if @xmath31 is missing exactly @xmath107 pairs of letters , these pairs will be exactly the pairs missing from @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath31 is missing fewer than @xmath107 pairs of letters , then the pairs consist of all missing pairs of letters , plus the remaining letters paired arbitrarily . )    make @xmath117 by repeating the first instance of every unordered pair of letters in @xmath31 except for @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 .",
    "the cycle @xmath117 now contains all multisets except @xmath121 @xmath122 now , add the string @xmath123 to the end of @xmath117 to create @xmath124 .",
    "this provides exactly the missing multisets , creating a ucycle on 3multisets .    for example , when @xmath125 , we start with the following ucycle on 3subsets : @xmath126 the ucycle on 3subsets @xmath31 does not contain the pairs @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . hence , we set @xmath127 note that @xmath114 equals the first character of @xmath31 , and @xmath128 equals the last .",
    "now , we repeat the first instance of every unordered pair except for @xmath102 , @xmath129 , @xmath104 , @xmath130 , @xmath105 , @xmath131 , @xmath103 , and @xmath132 .",
    "( note that four of these pairs do not appear in @xmath31 . if some of these pairs actually did appear in @xmath31 , because @xmath31 was missing fewer than @xmath107 pairs of letters",
    ", it would not affect the proof . ) : @xmath133 finally , we add the string @xmath134 to complete the ucycle : @xmath135    the proof is similar when @xmath3 is odd , and we omit it for the sake of brevity .",
    "both of the proofs given above suggest natural extensions to the @xmath21 and larger cases , and it is simple to use the techniques described above to create a proof sketch . in personal correspondence , glenn hurlbert indicated that his technique for creating ucycles on sets in @xcite can also be used to create ucycles on multisets .",
    "though this provides a more concise proof for the existence of ucycles on 3multisets , the two proofs presented may prove useful by their introduction of new techniques for approaching ucycles .",
    "the first proof is notable for its use of induction , a technique which has not been used before to create ucycles .",
    "the second , while it is tied to ucycles on sets , is not tied to any particular approach for creating ucycles on sets ; it could perhaps be extended to situations to which hurlbert s technique can not .    for values of @xmath3 and @xmath0",
    "for which ucycles do exist , one interesting question is how many ucycles exist .",
    "clearly each ucycles has @xmath136 representations , since there are @xmath136 permutations of @xmath12 .",
    "however , when searching for ucycles using a computer , vast numbers of _ distinct _ ( i.e. not differing merely by a permutation of @xmath12 ) ucycles were found .",
    "currently , it is not clear whether @xmath137 , the number of distinct ucycles for a given value of @xmath3 and @xmath0 , is a function that has a simple description .",
