    "the polarization of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons produced in electroweak production processes is in general highly nontrivial .",
    "one therefore has a rich phenomenology of polarization effects in @xmath11 production and decay which will be explored in present and future experiments .",
    "the polarization of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons can be probed by decay correlations involving the decay products of the polarized @xmath11 bosons .",
    "a widely discussed prominent example of such decay correlations is the decay @xmath3 followed by @xmath12 where the decay @xmath12 is used to analyze the helicity fractions of the @xmath5 resulting from the decay @xmath3 ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "this paper is devoted to the calculation of nlo qcd effects in the decay of polarized @xmath11 gauge bosons into massless and massive quark  antiquark pairs . in order to provide a quick access to the importance of quark mass effects",
    "we have made use of a quark mass expansion of the rather lengthy fully analytic nlo results listed in  @xcite .",
    "we thereby demonstrate that , in polarized gauge boson decays involving charm and bottom quarks , the nlo finite mass effects are non - negligible .",
    "the reason is that the nlo finite mass corrections in polarized decays set in at linear order with rather large coefficients , contrary to the case of unpolarized decay where the finite mass effects set in only at @xmath18 .",
    "depending on the particular polarized decay function , the mass corrections can become as large as the leading term of the nlo mass expansion for decays involving @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks .",
    "nlo and finite mass effects will affect the decay correlations between the momenta of the production and decay process .",
    "as specific examples of how such correlations are affected by nlo and finite mass effects we consider the cascade decay process @xmath21 and the production / decay process @xmath22 .",
