    "for example , the @xmath37 differential cross section is constant at high energies since the spin of the exchanged @xmath54 is @xmath77 in fact , after integration over phase space , the cross section for pairs of vector bosons in photon - photon collisions increases logarithmically with energy .",

    "the study of @xmath88 is complimentary to the corresponding @xmath89 channel , but it also can check for the presence of anomalous four - point @xmath90 interactions not already constrained by electromagnetic gauge invariance , such as the effects due to @xmath91 exchange .",
    "a main focus of the pair production measurements are the values of the @xmath54 magnetic moment @xmath92 and quadruple moment @xmath93 the standard model predicts @xmath94 and @xmath95 up to radiative corrections analogous to the schwinger corrections to the electron anomalous moment .",
    "the anomalous moments are thus defined as @xmath96 and @xmath97    the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are close to zero is actually a general property of any spin - one system if its size is small compared to its compton scale . for example , consider the drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule  @xcite for the @xmath54 magnetic moment : @xmath100",

    "in contrast to the time - like process @xmath131 , the @xmath15 and @xmath36 reactions are sensitive to the anomalous moments of the gauge bosons at @xmath132 the vanishing of the logarithmic integral of @xmath133 in the born approximation implies that there must be a center - of - mass energy , @xmath134 , where the polarization asymmetry @xmath135 possesses a zero , _",

    "in addition to the fact that only a limited range of energy is required , the polarization asymmetry measurements have the advantage that many of the systematic errors cancel in taking cross section ratios . this technique can clearly be generalized to other higher order tree - graph processes in the standard model and supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "the position of the zero in the photoabsorption asymmetry thus provides an additional weapon in the arsenal used to probe anomalous trilinear gauge couplings .",
    "because of the simplicity of its initial state , two - photon collisions provide an important laboratory for testing coherent and incoherent effects in quantum chromodynamics . in qcd events where each photon is resolved  @xcite in terms of its intermediate quark and gluon states , @xmath35 collisions resemble point - like meson - meson collisions .",
    "one can study detailed features of @xmath140 at threshold and its final state evolution . in the case of single or double diffractive two - photon events , one can study fundamental aspects of pomeron and odderon @xmath75-channel physics . for example , the energy asymmetry of charm quark versus anti - charm jets in four - jet reactions can measure the interference of the pomeron and odderon  @xcite .",

    "the qcd description of the hard qcd pomeron is given by the bfkl analysis  @xcite .",
    "there has been progress in stabilizing the bfkl predictions at next - to - leading - order by using blm scale fixing  @xcite .",
    "the analogous qcd physics of the gluon rescattering in diffractive deep inelastic scattering is discussed in the references  @xcite .",

    "it also should be possible to identify the separate charm , bottom , top and @xmath54 contributions to the photon structure functions .",
    "the photon structure functions receive hadron - like contributions from the photon s resolved fock components as well as its direct component derived from the @xmath143   time - like qcd compton amplitude . because of the direct contributions , the photon structure functions obey an inhomogeneous evolution equation . the result ,",
    "as first shown by witten  @xcite is that the leading order qcd structure functions of the photon have a unique scaling behavior : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "the most characteristic behavior of the photon structure function @xmath147 in qcd is its continuous linear rise of with @xmath148 at fixed @xmath149 . as emphasized by peterson , walsh and zerwas  @xcite ,",
    "the fact that this tree graph behavior is preserved to all orders in perturbation theory is due to the balance in qcd between the increase of the phase space for gluon emission in the scattering processes versus the decreasing strength of the gluon coupling due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "although the logarithmic rise of the born approximation result is preserved , the shape of @xmath150 is modified by the qcd radiation . if the running coupling constant were to freeze to a constant value at large momentum transfer , the photon structure function stops rising at high @xmath151 due to the increased phase space for gluon radiation . thus probing the qcd photon structure functions at the high momentum transfers available at the nlc",
    "will provide a valuable test of asymptotic freedom .",
    "hoyer , marchal , peigne , and sannino and i  @xcite have challenged the common view that structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are determined by the probability of finding quarks and gluons in the target hadron .",
    "we show that this is not correct in gauge theory .",
    "gluon exchange between the fast , outgoing partons and target spectators , which is usually assumed to be an irrelevant gauge artifact , affects the leading twist structure functions in a profound way .",
    "this observation removes the apparent contradiction between the projectile ( eikonal ) and target ( parton model ) views of diffractive and small @xmath152 phenomena .",
    "the diffractive scattering of the fast outgoing quarks on spectators in the target in turn causes shadowing in the dis cross section .",
    "thus the depletion of the nuclear structure functions is not intrinsic to the wave function of the nucleus , but is a coherent effect arising from the destructive interference of diffractive channels induced by final - state interactions .",
    "this is consistent with the glauber - gribov interpretation of shadowing as a rescattering effect .",
    "similar effects can be present in the photon structure function ; _ i.e. _ , the photon structure function will be modified by rescattering of the struck quark with the photon s spectator system .",
    "measurements from the hermes and smc collaborations show a remarkably large azimuthal single - spin asymmetries @xmath153 and @xmath154 of the proton in semi - inclusive pion leptoproduction @xmath155 dae sung hwang and ivan schmidt and i  @xcite have shown that final - state interactions from gluon exchange between the outgoing quark and the target spectator system lead to single - spin asymmetries in deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering at leading twist in perturbative qcd ; _ i.e. _ , the rescattering corrections are not power - law suppressed at large photon virtuality @xmath151 at fixed @xmath156 .",
    "the existence of such single - spin asymmetries requires a phase difference between two amplitudes coupling the proton target with @xmath157 to the same final - state , the same amplitudes which are necessary to produce a nonzero proton anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "we have shown that the exchange of gauge particles between the outgoing quark and the proton spectators produces a coulomb - like complex phase which depends on the angular momentum @xmath158 of the proton s constituents and is thus distinct for different proton spin amplitudes .",
    "the single - spin asymmetry which arises from such final - state interactions does not factorize into a product of distribution function and fragmentation function , and it is not related to the transversity distribution @xmath159 which correlates transversely polarized quarks with the spin of the transversely polarized target nucleon .",
    "these effects highlight the unexpected importance of final and initial state interactions in qcd observables .",
    "final state interactions will also lead to new types of single spin asymmetries in photon - photon collisions .",
    "for example , in @xmath160 and @xmath161 we expect @xmath162-odd correlations of the type @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the polarization of the real photon , @xmath165 is the beam direction of an incident virtual photon , and @xmath166 is the direction of a produced quark or hadron .",
    "the resulting asymmetry of the photon polarized normal to the production plane will be leading twist .",
    "as in the proton target case , the single - spin asymmetry will be sensitive to orbital angular momentum in the photon wavefunction and details of the photon structure at the amplitude level .",
    "the high energies of a photon - photon collider will make the study of double diffractive @xmath167 and semi - inclusive single diffractive processes @xmath168 in the regge regime @xmath169 interesting . here",

    "in addition , the photon can diffractively dissociate into quark pairs @xmath175 by coulomb scattering on the incoming electron .",

    "in fact , the ratio of the @xmath225 and @xmath226 amplitudes at large @xmath85 and fixed @xmath227 is nearly insensitive to the running coupling and the shape of the pion distribution amplitude : @xmath228    the comparison of the pqcd prediction for the sum of @xmath229 plus @xmath230 channels with cleo data @xcite is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : cleo ] .",
    "the cleo data for charged pion and kaon pairs show a clear transition to the scaling and angular distribution predicted by pqcd @xcite for @xmath231 gev .",
    "it is clearly important to measure the magnitude and angular dependence of the two - photon production of neutral pions and @xmath232 in view of the strong sensitivity of these channels to the shape of meson distribution amplitudes ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : piangle ] and [ fig : rhoangle ] ) .",
    "qcd also predicts that the production cross section for charged @xmath233-pairs ( with any helicity ) is much larger than for that of neutral @xmath233 pairs , particularly at large @xmath206 angles .",
    "similar predictions are possible for other helicity - zero mesons . for an alternative model based on the qcd ",
    "handbag \" diagram , see the references  @xcite .",
    "the leading - twist qcd predictions for exclusive two - photon processes such as the photon - to - pion transition form factor and @xmath38 hadron pairs are based on rigorous factorization theorems .",
    "the data from the cleo collaboration on @xmath234 and the sum of @xmath235 and @xmath236 channels are in excellent agreement with the qcd predictions .",
    "it is particularly compelling to see a transition in angular dependence between the low energy chiral and pqcd regimes .",
    "the problem of setting the renormalization scale of the coupling for exclusive amplitudes is discussed in the references  @xcite .",
    "the success of leading - twist perturbative qcd scaling for exclusive processes at presently experimentally accessible momentum transfer can be understood if the effective coupling @xmath237 is approximately constant at the relatively small scales @xmath238 relevant to the hard scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "evidence that the qcd coupling has an ir fixed point at small scales has been presented in the references  @xcite ; the evolution of the quark distribution amplitudes in the low-@xmath238 domain also needs to be minimal .",
    "sudakov suppression of the endpoint contributions is also strengthened if the coupling is frozen because of the exponentiation of a double logarithmic series .",
    "conformal symmetry can be used as a guide to organize the hard scattering calculation and to determine the leading contributions to the hadron distribution amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "as noted above , the analysis of exclusive @xmath12 decays has much in common with the analysis of exclusive two - photon reactions  @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the three representative contributions to the decay of a @xmath12 meson to meson pairs illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : b](a ) the weak interaction effective operator @xmath239 produces a @xmath240 in a color octet state .",
    "a gluon with virtuality @xmath241 is needed to equilibrate the large momentum fraction carried by the @xmath23 quark in the @xmath242 wavefunction .",
    "the amplitude then factors into a hard qcd / electroweak subprocess amplitude for quarks which are collinear with their respective hadrons : @xmath243 \\to [ q(y ) \\bar u(1-y)]_1 [ q(z ) \\bar q(1-z)]_2)$ ] convoluted with the distribution amplitudes @xmath244 @xcite of the incident and final hadrons : @xmath245 here @xmath246 are the light - cone momentum fractions carried by the valence quarks .",
    "baryon pair production in two - photon annihilation is also an important testing ground for qcd  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath216 for compton scattering requires the evaluation of 368 helicity - conserving tree diagrams which contribute to @xmath247 at the born level and a careful integration over singular intermediate energy denominators @xcite .",
    "brooks and dixon @xcite have completed a recalculation of the proton compton process at leading order in pqcd , extending and correcting earlier work .",
    "it is useful to consider the ratio @xmath248 since the power - law fall - off , the normalization of the valence wavefunctions , and much of the uncertainty from the scale of the qcd coupling cancel .",
    "the scaling and angular dependence of this ratio is sensitive to the shape of the proton distribution amplitudes .",
    "the perturbative qcd predictions for the phase of the compton amplitude phase can be tested in virtual compton scattering by interference with bethe - heitler processes @xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath199 has been measured at lep by the opal and l3 collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the results are in essential agreement with perturbative qcd scaling and the predictions for the angular dependence .",
    "however , the normalization of the pqcd three - quark predictions  @xcite appear to underestimate the measured exclusive cross section by an order of magnitude",
    ". this could be evidence for an effective quark - diquark structure of the proton wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "however , the normalization discrepancy with the leading - twist qcd predictions could be due to several reasons .",
    "( 1 ) note that the rate is proportional to @xmath249 the qcd coupling is assumed to have a nominal value @xmath250  @xcite which could be an underestimate of the effective value of the running qcd coupling at the relevant scales . ( 2 )",
    "the leading order perturbative qcd predictions lead to real amplitudes .",
    "the imaginary parts which appear from the analytic continuation of the qcd coupling and final state qcd interactions can also give a significant correction , as is known to be the case in @xmath251  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the relatively slow fall - off of the pauli form factor as observed in polarization transfer experiments at jefferson lab , suggests significant higher twist contributions .",
    "all of these arguments suggest that the most reliable test of qcd are obtained from the ratio : @xmath252 .",
    "in addition measurements of the proton polarization single - spin asymmetry provides important information on the phase of the timelike pair production amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to measure baryon and isobar pair production in two photon reactions near threshold .",
    "ratios such as @xmath253 can be as large as @xmath254 in the quark model since the three - quark wavefunction of the @xmath255 is expected to be symmetric .",
    "such large ratios would not be expected in soliton models @xcite in which intermediate multi - pion channels play a major role .",
    "pobylitsa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown how the predictions of perturbative qcd can be extended to processes such as @xmath256 where the pion is produced at low velocities relative to that of the @xmath257 or @xmath258 by utilizing soft pion theorems in analogy to soft photon theorems in qed .",
    "the distribution amplitude of the @xmath259 composite is obtained from the proton distribution amplitude from a chiral rotation .",
    "a test of this procedure in inelastic electron scattering at large momentum transfer @xmath260 and small invariant @xmath261 mass has been remarkably successful .",
    "many tests of the soft meson procedure are possible in multiparticle @xmath16 and @xmath15 final states .",
    "one of the formidable challenges in qcd is the calculation of non - perturbative wavefunctions of hadrons from first principles .",
    "the calculations of the pion distribution amplitude by dalley @xcite and by burkardt and seal @xcite using light - cone and transverse lattice methods is particularly encouraging .",
    "the predicted form of @xmath262 is somewhat broader than but not inconsistent with the asymptotic form favored by the measured normalization of @xmath263 and the pion wavefunction inferred from diffractive di - jet production .",
    "clearly much more experimental input on hadron wavefunctions is needed , particularly from measurements of two - photon exclusive reactions into meson and baryon pairs at the high luminosity @xmath12 factories .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : piangle ] , the ratio @xmath264 is particularly sensitive to the shape of pion distribution amplitude . at fixed pair mass , and high photon virtuality , one can study the distribution amplitude of multi - hadron states @xcite .",
    "two - photon annihilation will provide much information on fundamental qcd processes such as deeply virtual compton scattering and large angle compton scattering in the crossed channel .",
    "i have also emphasized the interrelation between the wavefunctions measured in two - photon collisions and the wavefunctions needed to study exclusive @xmath12 and @xmath265 decays .",
    "much of the most interesting two - photon annihilation physics is accessible at low energy , high luminosity @xmath16 colliders , including measurements of channels important in the light - by - light contribution to the muon @xmath2662 and the study of the transition between threshold production controlled by low - energy effective chiral theories and the domain where leading - twist perturbative qcd becomes applicable .",
    "the threshold regime of hadron production in photon - photon and @xmath16 annihilation , where hadrons are formed at small relative velocity , is particularly interesting as a test of low energy theorems , soliton models , and new types of resonance production .",
    "such studies will be particularly valuable in double - tagged reactions where polarization correlations , as well as the photon virtuality dependence , can be studied .",
    "the light - front quantization of gauge theories can be carried out in an elegant way using the dirac method to impose the light - cone gauge constraint and eliminate dependent degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "unlike the case in equal - time quantization , the vacuum remains trivial .",
    "since only physical degrees of freedom appear , unitarity is maintained .",
    "one can verify the qcd ward identities for the physical light - cone gauge and compute the qcd @xmath267 function .",
    "srivastava and i  @xcite have extended the light - front quantization procedure to the standard model .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry is due to a zero mode of the scalar field rather than vacuum breaking .",
    "the goldstone component of the scalar field provides mass to the @xmath79 and @xmath268 gauge bosons as well as completing its longitudinal polarization .",
    "the resulting theory is free of faddeev - popov ghosts and is unitary and renormalizable .",
    "the resulting rules give an elegant new way to compute standard model processes using light - front hamiltonian theory .",
    "the light - front method suggests the possibility of developing an  event amplitude generator \" for high energy processes such as photon - photon collisions by calculating amplitudes for specific parton spins using light - front time - ordered perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the positivity of the @xmath269 light - front momenta greatly constrains the number of contributing light - front time orderings .",
    "since particle states are labelled by the spin projection @xmath270 , total angular momentum constraints are readily implemented .",
    "the renormalized amplitude can be obtained diagram by diagram by using the  alternating denominator \" method which automatically subtracts the relevant counterterm .",
    "the dlcq method also provides a simple way to discretized the light - front momentum variables , while maintaining frame - independence .",
    "the resulting renormalized amplitude can be convoluted with the light - front wavefunctions to simulate hadronization and hadron matrix elements .",
