    "high resolution full sky cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps are now available from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment  @xcite , offering an unprecedented opportunity to probe the global structure of our universe ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this article discusses expected cmb anisotropies in spherical spaces , providing simulated cmb maps and their corresponding power spectra produced using the methods of our companion papers  @xcite .    the recent wmap results interestingly indicate that a closed universe seems to be marginally preferred  @xcite . in particular , with a prior on the hubble constant ,",
    "one gets a density parameter @xmath6 , while further including type ia supernovae data leads to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the wmap angular correlation function seems to lack signal on scales larger than 60 degrees  @xcite .",
    "this may indicate a possible discreteness and a cutoff in the initial power spectrum , as would be expected from a multiconnected topology .",
    "contrary to the standard lore , we will see that for lens spaces @xmath0 the topology leads to an increase of the cmb power on large angular scales .",
    "this boost of power is related to the fact that space becomes more and more anisotropic as @xmath3 increases . the same effect also appears for ( flat ) slab and chimney spaces  @xcite but not in a well - proportioned space as the poincar dodecahedral space  @xcite . in addition ,",
    "cosmological data indicate that @xmath8 is small , which has important implications concerning the observability of the topological structure of our universe  @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that we could detect a compact hyperbolic space if @xmath9 is small and negative , because , for a generic observer , the topology scale is comparable to the curvature radius or longer .",
    "only an observer lucky enough to live near a short closed geodesic could detect topology  @xcite .",
    "in flat universes , the topological scale is completely independent of the horizon radius , because euclidean geometry has no preferred scale and admits similarities .",
    "there is no fundamental reason for the topology scale to be less than the horizon radius but still large enough to accommodate the lack of obvious local periodicity .",
    "compact flat universes have nevertheless been studied extensively . in particular ,",
    "it was shown on the basis of the cobe data that , for a vanishing cosmological constant , no more than @xmath10 copies of the fundamental cell within our horizon are allowed  @xcite . a non - vanishing cosmological constant relaxes the constraint to @xmath11 copies  @xcite if @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a catalog of maps for all flat spaces ( compact , chimney and slab ) will soon be available  @xcite .    in spherical spaces the topology scale is tied to the curvature radius , but as the topology gets more complicated , the typical shortest distance between two topological images decreases .",
    "so , no matter how flat the universe , all but a finite number of spherical topologies remain detectable .",
    "three - dimensional spherical spaces were originally classified by threlfall and seifert  @xcite in 1930 .",
    "the classification was recently revisited in terms of single , double and linked action manifolds by gausmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "borrowing from thurston s approach  @xcite , we used the fact that any finite group of unit quaternions determines a fixed point free group @xmath14 of isometries of @xmath15 , which then serves as the holonomy group of a multiply connected spherical space .",
    "the spaces arising in this way are called _ single action _ spaces and are in one - to - one correspondence with the finite subgroups of @xmath15 , thought of as the group of all unit length quaternions .",
    "the finite subgroups of @xmath15 are the cyclic groups @xmath16 , the binary dihedral groups @xmath17 , the binary tetrahedral , octahedral and icosahedral groups , respectively of order @xmath18 , @xmath19 , 24 , 48 and 120 . in a _",
    "double action _",
    "space , two groups of relatively prime order act simultaneously so that @xmath14 is the product of a cyclic group by either a cyclic or or a binary polyhedral group .",
    "_ linked action _ spaces are similar to double action spaces except that the orders of the factors are not relatively prime and only certain elements of one factor are allowed to act simultaneously with a given element of the other factor . in all cases",
    "the volume of the space @xmath20 is the volume of the 3-sphere @xmath15 divided by the order @xmath21 of the holonomy group .",
    "_ lens spaces _ can be single action , double action , or linked action . a lens space",
    "s fundamental domain is constructed by identifying the two faces of a lens shaped solid with a @xmath22 rotation , for relatively prime integers @xmath3 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .",
    "the result is the lens space @xmath25 .",
    "exactly @xmath3 copies of the fundamental domain tile the 3-sphere , their faces lying on great 2-spheres filling a hemisphere of each , just as the 2-dimensional surface of an orange may be tiled with @xmath3 sections of orange peel , meeting along meridians spaced @xmath26 apart .",
    "different lens spaces may share the same abstract holonomy group ; for example @xmath27 and @xmath28 both have @xmath29 even though the group acts differently in each case .",
    "non - cyclic fundamental groups , by contrast , act in a unique way .",
    "topology breaks the global isotropy and possibly the global homogeneity of the universe , the only exception being projective space ( see ref .",
    "consequently , the cmb temperature angular correlation function will depend on the two directions of observation , not only on their relative angle , and possibly on the position of the observer as well .",
    "this induces correlations between the @xmath30 of different @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "such correlations are hidden when one considers only the angular correlation function and its coefficients , @xmath33 , in a legendre polynomial decomposition , because they pick up only the isotropic part and are therefore a poor indicator of the topology .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath34 encodes all the topological properties of the cmb ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "conversely , in a simply - connected space it reduces to the usual formula @xmath35 .    in a companion paper  @xcite",
    ", we showed that cmb maps with a topological signal can be confidently simulated for flat and spherical spaces .",
    "topology does not affect local physics and enters only via the boundary conditions of the functions defined on the multi - connected space .",
    "technically , the equations of the cosmological perturbations reduce to a set of coupled differential equations involving the laplacian operator .",
    "they are conveniently solved in fourier space but this requires the determination of the eigenmodes @xmath36}_{{k}\\,{}}}$ ] with the correct boundary conditions . in @xmath15 , the eigenmodes @xmath37}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ]",
    "are labelled by an integer @xmath38 , related to @xmath39 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the spatial curvature , and each eigenvalue @xmath42 has a multiplicity @xmath43 .",
    "the eigenmodes @xmath36}_{{k}\\,{}}}$ ] can be expressed in terms of the eigenmodes of @xmath15 as @xmath36}_{{k}\\,{s}}}= \\sum_{\\ell , m } { \\xi^{[{\\gamma}]\\,{s}}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m } } } { { \\cal y}^{[{{{{\\bf}s}^3}}]}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ] , so that all the topological information is encoded in the coefficients @xmath44\\,{s}}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ] , where @xmath45 indexes the eigenmodes sharing a common value of @xmath39 .",
    "one finds that the weyl formula holds for spherical spaces , so a space of order @xmath21 has approximately @xmath46 } } \\sim n^{\\scriptscriptstyle{[{{{\\bf}s}^3 } ] } } / |\\gamma|$ ] modes  @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 } } \\to c_\\ell^{\\scriptscriptstyle{[{{{\\bf}s}^3}]}}$ ] when @xmath31 becomes large  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a numerical check of this behaviour for a torus ) .",
    "for lens and prism spaces the coefficients @xmath44\\,{s}}_{{k}\\,{\\ell}\\,{m}}}$ ] were recently computed analytically using a toroidal coordinate system  @xcite .",
    "cmb codes generally use spherical coordinates but the change of coordinates has been handled  @xcite .    for a homogeneous lens space @xmath48 , the parameter @xmath3 plays a role analogous ( but opposite ) to the size @xmath49 of a torus in the flat case .",
    "the largest spherical 3-manifolds are @xmath50 which is the @xmath51-sphere and @xmath52 which is projective @xmath51-space .",
    "here we consider the generic case @xmath53 . as @xmath3 increases ,",
    "the volume of the space @xmath54 decreases . for typical values of @xmath38",
    "the number of modes diminishes in rough proportion to @xmath55 according to the weyl formula .",
    "however the @xmath56 mode has multiplicity @xmath51 for all @xmath53 .",
    "thus the @xmath56 mode has proportionally higher weight in @xmath54 than in @xmath15 , which explains the excess of power on large angular scales ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "more precisely , after rescaling by the weyl formula s factor of @xmath57 , the @xmath56 mode of @xmath54 has an effective multiplicity of @xmath58 , compared to the @xmath56 mode of @xmath15 which has multiplicity @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath54 is always @xmath56 and has constant multiplicity @xmath51 for all @xmath53 contrasts sharply to the behavior of the cubic @xmath51-torus of size @xmath49 , for which the smallest eigenvalue scales as @xmath60 .",
    "this contrasting behavior can be understood by realizing that as @xmath3 increases the space is becoming smaller in only one direction and remains large in perpendicular directions : on large scales we see a @xmath61-dimensional repartition of modes that are perpendicular to the axis of the lens , and the relative weight of large scale as compared to small scales is larger in lower dimensional spaces .",
    "an informal examination of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] suggests the very conservative upper bound @xmath62 when @xmath4 , for consistency with wmap s observation of a low quadrupole , keeping in mind that this bound depends on @xmath1 .",
    "this constraint was obtained on the basis of the angular power spectrum only , while a comparison of the full correlation matrix is left for further investigation .",
    "this bound on @xmath3 was set without any refined statistical analysis mainly because the low @xmath31 part of the spectrum becomes obviously inconsistent with wmap data as @xmath3 increases .",
    "this conservative bound can be used to select the range of a grid for further , more rigorous statistical investigations .",
    "let us also emphasize that our numerical results include all components of the cmb , in particular the doppler and integrated sachs - wolfe contributions , the effects of which were detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    matching circles",
    "@xcite occur when the distance @xmath63 between two closest topological images is less than the diameter of the last scattering surface , as summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "0.25 cm    .the first three rows give the curvature radius @xmath64 , the radius @xmath65 of the last scattering surface in units of the curvature radius , and the volume of the observable universe as a fraction of the whole universe .",
    "the last row gives the constraints on the order @xmath3 of the cyclic group so that the topology scale is small enough to be detectable ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "all numbers are given for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates how the matching circles are diametrally opposite but matched with a twist of @xmath26 , simply because clifford translations twist and translate the same amount . as @xmath3 increases , the map becomes more and more anisotropic with obvious twisted structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . the number of matched circles is given by @xmath70 ( see fig .  [ fig1c ] ) .",
    "recalling that double and linked action spaces combine the action of a cyclic group @xmath71 with a more general group @xmath72 , let us now consider the effect of the @xmath72 factor . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nearest repeating images typically depend only on the @xmath73 factor , that factor alone may generate matching circles , and circle searching effectively reduces to the case of @xmath74 . the @xmath72 factor ,",
    "although typically irrelevant for circle searching , may nevertheless affect the power spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig1d ] shows power spectra for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 , @xmath72 trivial ) , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , @xmath72 trivial ) , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 ( @xmath78 , @xmath83 ) , and @xmath84 ( @xmath78 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "full understanding of the power spectrum of a general @xmath25 will require more numerical investigation .",
    "this article studied the imprint of a lens space topology on the cmb .",
    "it provided simulated cmb maps and analyzed potential detectability using the circle matching method .",
    "the lens spaces @xmath86 generically have a high quadrupole : when @xmath4 , consistency with wmap s quadrupole seems to imply @xmath62 , while for the same value of @xmath1 the lss will intersect itself ( and thus produce potentially detectable matching circles ) if and only if @xmath87 .",
