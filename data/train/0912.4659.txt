    "in conventional quantum mechanics , operators such as the hamiltonian @xmath4 and the position @xmath5 are ordinarily taken to be real in the sense that they are hermitian ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the condition of hermiticity allows the matrix elements of these operators to be complex , but guarantees that their eigenvalues are real .",
    "similarly , in the study of classical mechanics the trajectories of particles are assumed to be real functions of time .",
    "however , in recent years both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics have been extended and generalized to the complex domain . in classical dynamical systems",
    "the complex as well as the real solutions to hamilton s differential equations of motion have been studied @xcite . in this generalization of conventional classical mechanics , classical particles",
    "are not constrained to move along the real axis and may travel through the complex plane . in quantum mechanics the class of physically allowed hamiltonians has been broadened to include non - hermitian @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonians in addition to hermitian hamiltonians , and wave functions ( solutions to the schrdinger equation ) are treated as functions of complex coordinates @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of physical systems described by complex @xmath7-symmetric hamiltonians are now being reported @xcite .",
    "the relationship between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics is subtle .",
    "quantum mechanics is essentially wavelike ; probability amplitudes are described by a wave equation and physical observations involve such wavelike phenomena as interference patterns and nodes .",
    "in contrast , classical mechanics describes the motion of particles and exhibits none of these wavelike features .",
    "nevertheless , there is a connection between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics , and according to bohr s famous correspondence principle this subtle connection becomes more pronounced at high energy .",
    "pauling and wilson @xcite give a simple pictorial explanation of the correspondence principle and this explanation is commonly repeated in other standard texts on quantum mechanics ( see , for example , ref .",

    "@xmath8 the quantum energy levels are @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the fourth eigenfunction @xmath11 has four nodes , and the associated probability density @xmath12 also has four nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . when @xmath13 , the quantum probability density has 16 nodes ( see fig .  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the probability density for a classical particle is inversely proportional to the speed of the particle and is thus a smooth nonoscillatory curve , while the quantum - mechanical probability density is oscillatory and has nodes .",
    "figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] show that the classical probability at high energy is a local average of the quantum probability .",

    "the normalized classical probability density for a particle of the same energy is also plotted ( dotted curve ) ; the classical probability density is not wavelike .",
    "both probability densities are greatest near the turning points , which lie at @xmath17 , because the speed of the particle is smallest in the vicinity of the turning points .",
    "thus , the particle spends most of its time and is most likely to be found near the turning points . the classical probability density , which is the inverse of the speed @xmath18 of the particle , is infinite at the turning points because @xmath18 vanishes at the turning points , but this singularity is integrable . ]     in a parabolic potential . the quantum probability density ( solid curve )",
    "has 16 nodes and is wavelike while the classical probability density ( dotted curve ) is not wavelike ; inside the potential well the quantum density oscillates about the classical density . ]",
    "the objective of this paper is to extend and expand the work in a recent letter that examines the relationship between complex classical mechanics and complex quantum mechanics @xcite . in particular , we show how to generalize the elementary pauling - and - wilson picture of the correspondence principle into the complex domain .",
    "we will see that in the complex domain some of the distinctions between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics become less pronounced .",
    "for example , in complex classical mechanics , particle trajectories can enter classically forbidden regions and consequently exhibit tunneling - like phenomena @xcite .",
    "figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] highlight an important difference between real classical systems and real quantum systems in the classically forbidden region : outside the classically allowed region , which is delimited by the turning points , the classical probability density vanishes identically while the quantum - mechanical probability density is nonzero and decays exponentially .",
    "this discrepancy decreases as the energy increases because the quantum probability becomes more localized in the classically allowed region , but for any value of the energy there remains a sharp cutoff in the classical probability beyond the turning points .    in the physical world",
    "the cutoff at the boundary between the classically allowed and the classically forbidden regions is not perfectly sharp .",
    "for example , in classical optics it is known that below the surface of an imperfect conductor , the electromagnetic fields do not vanish abruptly .",
    "rather , they decay exponentially as functions of the penetration depth . this effect is known as _ skin depth _ @xcite .",
    "the case of total internal reflection is similar : when the angle of incidence is less than a critical angle , there is a reflected wave and no transmitted wave .",
    "however , the electromagnetic field does cross the boundary ; this field is attenuated exponentially in a few wavelengths beyond the interface .",
    "although this field does not vanish in the classically forbidden region , there is no flux of energy ; that is , the poynting vector vanishes in the classically forbidden region beyond the interface .",
    "when classical mechanics is extended into the complex domain , classical particles are allowed to enter the classically forbidden region .",
    "however , in the forbidden region there is no particle flow parallel to the real axis .",
    "rather , the flow of classical particles is _ orthogonal _ to the axis .",
    "this feature is analogous to the vanishing flux of energy in the case of total internal reflection as described above .",
    "we illustrate these properties of complex classical mechanics by using the classical harmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is given in ( [ e101 ] ) .",
    "the classical equations of motion are @xmath19 where the complex coordinate is @xmath20 and the complex momentum is @xmath21 . for a particle having real energy @xmath22 and initial",
    "position @xmath23 , @xmath24 , the solution to ( [ e102 ] ) is @xmath25 thus , the possible classical trajectories are a family of ellipses parametrized by the initial position @xmath26 : @xmath27 four of these trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "each trajectory has the same period @xmath28 .",
    "the degenerate ellipse , whose foci are the turning points at @xmath29 , is the familiar real solution .",

    "these trajectories are nested ellipses .",
    "observe that when the harmonic oscillator is extended into the complex domain , the classical particles may pass through the classically forbidden regions outside the turning points .",
    "when the trajectories cross the real axis , they are orthogonal to it . ]    we can use the solution in ( [ e103 ] ) to extend the plots of classical probabilities in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] to the complex plane .",
    "the speed @xmath18 of a classical particle at the complex coordinate point @xmath20 is given by @xmath31 if we assume that all ellipses are equally likely trajectories , then the relative probability density of finding the classical particle at the point @xmath32 is @xmath33 .",
    "this function is plotted in fig .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows that the classical - mechanical probability density extends beyond the classically allowed region and into the complex plane . in this figure",
    "the distribution of classical probability in the complex plane falls off as the reciprocal of the distance from the origin .",
    "thus , beyond the turning points on the real line the classical probability density is no longer identically zero , and what is more , it begins to resemble the quantum - mechanical probability density in the classically forbidden regions on the real axis in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .     in the complex plane for a particle subject to harmonic forces .",
    "the probability density resembles a pup tent with infinitely high tent poles located at the turning points .",
    "the complex classical ellipses in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] are superposed on the tent canopy . ]",
    "we emphasize that while the probability surface in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] has the feature that it does not vanish on the real axis in the classically forbidden regions , it is entirely classical and thus there is none of the wavelike behavior that one would expect in quantum mechanics .",
    "this plot is two - dimensional and not one - dimensional , and this motivates us to define and calculate the complex analog of the quantum - mechanical probability density @xmath0 in the complex-@xmath34 plane . as in conventional quantum mechanics",
    ", this probability density @xmath35 depends quadratically on the wave function @xmath36 , and by virtue of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath35 satisfies a local conservation law in the complex plane .",
    "extending the quantum - mechanical probability density into the complex plane is nontrivial because @xmath37 is a _ complex - valued _ function of @xmath38 , and as we will see , @xmath0 is _ not _ the absolute square of @xmath36 and thus @xmath39 is also a complex - valued function .",
    "in contrast with ordinary quantum theory , it is not clear whether @xmath0 can be interpreted as a physical local probability density . to solve this problem we identify special curves in the complex-@xmath38 plane on which",
    "@xmath40 _ is _ real and positive .",
    "we find these special curves by constructing a differential equation that these curves obey .",
    "discovering these curves then allows us to formulate the complex version of the correspondence principle .",
    "the complex correspondence principle is extremely delicate ; understanding the probability density in complex quantum mechanics requires sophisticated mathematical tools , including the use of asymptotic analysis beyond poincar asymptotics ; that is , asymptotic analysis of transcendentally small contributions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] we obtain the form of the complex probability density in complex @xmath7 quantum mechanics and discuss the specific case of the harmonic oscillator .",

    "parity interchanges the probabilities ( [ e302 ] ) and ( [ e303 ] ) for rightward and leftward steps and thus has the effect of interchanging the indices @xmath111 and @xmath112 in ( [ e304 ] ) .",

    "there is a fundamental link between quantization of eigenvalues ( or of eigenpaths ) and hyperasymptotics : as the energy varies , just as it passes through an eigenvalue , one catches a glimpse of the transcendentally small ( subdominant ) component of the asymptotic behavior of the solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "this happens because the coefficient of the exponentially growing solution momentarily passes through zero , and this promotes the exponentially damped solution from hyperasymptotic status to poincar asymptotic status .",
    "in general , all @xmath251 eigenfunctions have @xmath251 nodes .",
    "thus , when @xmath338 , @xmath352 and @xmath346 , have one node each . however , we regard the node of @xmath352 as being unphysical because it is located on the imaginary axis , while the node of @xmath346 is physical because it is located on the real axis . for the general case , the lowest - energy eigenfunction has all @xmath251 nodes on the imaginary axis , and as the energy increases , more and more nodes move off the imaginary axis and become physical .",
    "the physical nodes lie on an arch - shaped curve that is symmetric about the imaginary axis .",
    "a numerical study of these nodes may be found in c.  m.  bender , s.  boettcher , and v.  m.  savage , j.  math .",
