    "in order to understand the function of a protein , the knowledge of its structure is of utmost importance .",
    "however , it is becoming more and more clear that in most cases this is not enough and that the relevant information needed is its _ structural ensemble _ , that is , a fair sample of the set of conformations a protein can visit at room temperature .",
    "a straightforward way to obtain this information is to perform a _",
    "long enough _ molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation in explicit solvent . in practice ,",
    "noteworthy in the case of enzymes , the timescale that has to be reached is at least of the order of the microsecond since the most efficient enzymes , like catalase , have turn - overs of this order of magnitude . nowadays , for standard size proteins , md simulations that long are routinely performed on supercomputers",
    "actually , using a dedicated asics - based supercomputer , the millisecond timescale has recently been reached , in the case of the small bpti model system  @xcite . moreover , starting from random initial configurations , accurate _ ab initio _ folding of several fast - folding peptides has been obtained  @xcite , revealing all the potential of the brute force approach for the years to come .",
    "however , even with a supercomputer , obtaining the relevant structural ensemble through this approach often takes months .",
    "moreover , this can hardly be done for very large systems , like the ribosome , whole virus capsids , _",
    "etc_. so , simplified methods are still welcome , noteworthy because , as a consequence of their low computational cost , they can be implemented on web - servers , where anybody can give them a try .",
    "a simple way to study the flexibility of a molecule is to perform a normal mode analysis ( nma ) .",
    "this method rests upon the fact that the classical equations of motion for a set of @xmath0 atoms can be solved analytically when the displacements of the atoms in the vicinity of their equilibrium positions are small enough . as a consequence , @xmath1 , the potential energy of the studied system ,",
    "can be approximated by the first terms of a taylor series . moreover , because the system is expected to be at equilibrium  , the term with the first derivatives of the energy ( the forces ) can be dropped , so that : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 coordinate of the system , @xmath5 being its equilibrium value .",
    "in other words , within the frame of this approximation , the potential energy of a system can be written as a quadratic form .",
    "in such a case , it is quite straightforward to show that the equations of atomic motion have the following solutions  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the atomic mass and where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the amplitude and phasis of the so - called normal mode of vibration @xmath10 , depend upon the initial conditions , that is , upon atomic positions and velocities at @xmath11 .    in practice , @xmath12 , the frequency of mode @xmath10 ,",
    "is obtained through the @xmath13 eigenvalue of the mass - weighted hessian of the potential energy , that is , the matrix whose elements are the mass - weighted second derivatives of the energy , the @xmath14 s being the coordinates of the corresponding eigenvector .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre ] , the frequency spectrum thus obtained for the protease of human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) is shown , when a standard empirical energy function is used , namely , as available in charmm  @xcite .",
    "the modes with the highest frequencies correspond to motions of pairs of atoms that are chemically bonded and the reason why these frequencies are much higher than others is because a hydrogen ( _ i.e. _ , a light particle ) is involved in these bonds . generally speaking , modes with high frequencies are localized , that is , only a few atoms are moving significantly at these frequencies .",
    "spectrum of the hiv protease , as obtained using standard normal mode analysis .",
    "the structure considered is the monomer found in pdb 1hhp , after energy - minimization .",
    "high - frequency modes are localized motions of chemically bonded atoms .",
    "the highest - frequency ones correspond to motions in which a hydrogen atom is involved .",
    "there are only a few ( 164 ) of them because an extended - atom model was considered  @xcite .",
    ", width=8 ]    on the contrary , on the low - frequency part of the spectrum , modes tend to involve large parts of the structure .",
    "this is probably why their comparison with protein functional motions was undertaken , the latter being often described as relative motions of structural domains  @xcite . as a matter of fact , in the first nma study of a protein with well defined domains , namely , the human lysozyme , the lowest - frequency mode ( @xmath15 = 3.6 @xmath16 ) was found to correspond to a hinge - bending motion  @xcite .",
    "later on , the lowest frequency modes of citrate synthase  @xcite and haemoglobin  @xcite were indeed found able to provide a fair description of the rather complex and large - amplitude motion these proteins experience upon ligand binding .",
    "getting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large matrix can prove challenging , in particular because methods available in mathematical libraries usually require the storage of the whole matrix in the computer memory .",
    "for a small protein like monomeric hiv protease ( 99 residues ) , this is not an issue since , with an extended - atom model , the storage of its hessian takes @xmath17 10 mo . for dimeric citrate synthase ( 2@xmath18 450 residues )",
    ", it takes 3 go .",
    "twenty years ago , this used to be an issue  @xcite .",
    "it is not any more .",
    "however , for not so uncommon multimeric systems like aspartate transcarbamylase ( nearly 3,000 residues ) , using standard approaches would still requires to have access , like at the time  @xcite , either to smarter numerical methods and/or to supercomputers , as the storage of the whole hessian would take 30 go of computer memory .      to overcome this practical limitation ,",
    "several methods have been proposed .",
    "note that within the frame of most of them it is not possible to get the @xmath19 normal modes of the system , that is , its full spectrum .",
    "when a good enough guess of a required eigenvector can be done , for instance when it is expected to be a relative motion of well - defined structural domains , a method of choice is the lanczos one , especially because it only involves calculations of matrix - vector products .",
    "this method was applied to the case of human lysozyme  @xcite as well as , later on , using a more sophisticated version of the algorithm , to the case of dimeric citrate synthase  @xcite .",
    "approximate frequencies of the hiv protease , as obtained through the rtb approximation , as a function of exact ones , when one or two amino - acid residues are put in each block .",
    "dotted lines are linear fits for the lowest - frequencies",
    ". , width=8 ]    other methods usually rely on the splitting of the hessian into blocks  @xcite , and/or on the choice of new coordinates that allow for the building of a smaller hessian whose eigensolutions are as close as possible to the original ones  @xcite . for instance , the principle of the rtb approximation  @xcite is to use the six rotation ( r ) and translation ( t ) vectors of `` blocks '' ( b ) of atoms as the new set of coordinates  .",
    "when each block contains a whole amino - acid residue , since there is , on average , @xmath20 atoms ( 48 coordinates ) per residue , the order of the hessian is reduced by a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , if the frequencies calculated with this approximation are found to be , as expected , higher than those of the full hessian , on the low - frequency part of the spectrum a proportionality is observed between approximate and exact values  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rtb ] ) .",
    "moreover , the corresponding approximate eigenvectors are found to be remarkably similar to exact ones  @xcite .",
    "of course , several amino - acid residues can be put in a given block  @xcite , and the way atoms are grouped into blocks can be made on smarter grounds  @xcite .",
    "note that reducing the size of the hessian is a coarse - graining process , which has the advantage of preserving the interactions between blocks , as they are observed in the all - atom model . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that low - frequency modes are little perturbed by the process suggest that they are robust , in the sense that the corresponding pattern of displacements does not depend significantly upon the details of the description of the system .     for each eigenvector of the hiv protease ,",
    "as obtained using a standard empirical energy function , the best overlap with an eigenvector obtained using tirion s model is given .",
    "the structure considered is the monomer found in pdb 1hhp , after energy - minimization .",
    "tirion s model was built using @xmath22 .",
    ", width=8 ]",
    "the fact that an approximation like ( [ eq : approx ] ) can prove useful for the study of protein functional motions is far from being obvious .",
    "first , because nma is usually performed for a single minimum of the potential energy surface , while it is well known that at room temperature a protein explores a huge number of different ones  @xcite . more generally , ( [ eq : approx ] ) means that the system is studied as if it were a solid , while it is quite clear that the liquid - like character of the dynamical behaviour of a protein , noteworthy of its amino - acid sidechains  @xcite , is required for its function  @xcite .",
    "moreover , prior to the development of simple implicit solvent models like eef1  @xcite , nma was usually performed _ in vacuo _ , while it is well known that water is essential for protein function  , not to mention the significant distortion a system experiences during the required preliminary energy minimization , when solvent effects are only taken into account through an effective dielectric constant  @xcite .",
    "so , from the very beginning , the usefulness of nma in the field of protein dynamics had to mean that functionally relevant normal modes are robust ones , similar from a minimum of the energy function to another  @xcite , but also from a forcefield to another .",
    "as an extreme check of the later point , monique tirion proposed to replace electrostatics and lennard - jones interactions in a protein by an harmonic term such that : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the actual distance between atoms @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 being their distance in the studied structure  @xcite . in other words , in tirion s model , all pairs of atoms less than @xmath28 ngstrms away from each other are linked by hookean springs .",
    "note that when , as herein , @xmath29 , the force constant , is the same for all atom pairs , it only plays the role of a scaling factor for the frequencies of the system . as a corollary ,",
    "the only parameter of the model is @xmath28 .     for each eigenvector of the hiv protease , as obtained using a standard empirical energy function , its dimension , _",
    "i.e. _ , the effective number of tirion s eigenvectors involved in its description is given .",

    ", width=8 ]    to evaluate how similar modes obtained with such a description of the non - bonded interactions in a protein are to those obtained with a standard , empirical , one , a useful quantity is the overlap : @xmath30 _ i.e. _ the square of the scalar product of the eigenvectors obtained in both cases .",
    "note that , because eigenvectors are normalized , for each of them : @xmath31 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bstrob ] , the overlap between an eigenvector obtained with ( [ eq : tirion ] ) and an eigenvector obtained with the energy function available in charmm  @xcite , can be as high as 0.8 , like in the case of the lowest - frequency mode of the hiv protease .",
    "so , obviously , this mode is a very robust one , in the sense that it depends little upon the nature of the atomic interactions in the structure .",
    "note in particular that , in the simplified version of tirion s model considered herein , at variance with tirion s original work  @xcite , chemically bonded atoms are treated on the same footing as other pairs of close atoms , that is , by linking them with a spring of same force constant ( @xmath29 ) .",

    "however , three other ones can be described with less than 30 of them .",
    "note also that some high - frequency modes can be described with a handful of tirion s modes .",

    "a possibility is that what determines the nature of these modes is the pattern of interactions between residues . as a matter of fact",
    ", simple methods have been proposed for evaluating protein flexibility through the study of the graph corresponding to the set of interactions observed in a given structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] shows such a graph , in the case of the hiv protease ) .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that , using the highly efficient pebble game algorithm  @xcite , hinges and flexible loops can be identified in proteins like the hiv protease , adenylate kinase , _ etc _  @xcite . on the other hand , diagonalizing directly the corresponding , so - called adjacency , matrix provides fair estimates of the amplitude of atomic fluctuations , as observed experimentally , noteworthy through crystallographic debye - wller factors  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : bf ] ) .",
    "interestingly , while the small eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are enough for providing such estimates , large eigenvalues seem also able to provide useful informations . indeed ,",
    "because eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues pinpoint spots in the structure where residue density ( in a coarse - grained sense ) is the highest , it has been suggested that they may correspond to protein folding cores  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of the hiv protease  @xcite , the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is dominated by the motion of gly 86 ( fig .  [ fig : gnm ] ) a residue close to asp 25 , the catalytic residue ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : graph ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is an hydrogen - bond between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the previous residue , ile 85 , and the backbone amide nitrogen of asp 25 .",

    "but , because when complexity increases , the time it takes to perform an analysis usually also does ( either for a human being or for a computer ) , the most useful are expected to be models that are only a bit more complex than enms . in practice , since enms are , in essence , single - parameter models , increasing their complexity means increasing their number of parameters .",
    "so , in order not to increase their complexity too much , a natural choice is to keep the number of parameters as small as possible .    along this line of thought",
    ", in order to recover one of the major property of the potential energy surface of a protein , namely , that it is a multi - minima one , network models with several ( usually two ) energy minima have been proposed  @xcite . however , a more basic property of such a surface is that it is highly anharmonic  @xcite .",
    "so , it seems worth starting by adding explicit non - linearity   into an elastic network model , _",
    "@xcite : @xmath69 the choice of an additional term with a power of four , instead of three , being mostly for symmetry reasons but also because previous works on one and two - dimensional systems had shown that the dynamical properties of systems with such an energy function can be quite spectacular  @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath70 , ( [ eq : nnm ] ) corresponds to ( [ eq : tirion ] ) , that is , to a standard enm ( up to now , only protein models with @xmath71 1 @xmath72 have been studied in depth  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the dynamical non - linear phenomenons that can occur in this context is the birth and the ( rather ) long - time survival of a discrete breather ( db )  @xcite , that is , a localized mode whose frequency is high enough , so that energy exchange with the rest of the system can prove extremely slow ( thousands of periods of the db ) . a way to observe such a phenomenon without making any a priori assumption on its nature ( localized or not , _ etc",
    "_ ) is to perform a molecular dynamics simulation , starting with a high initial temperature and cooling the system through friction on its surface atoms  @xcite .",
    "when a db sets up , the energy remaining into the system becomes ( quite suddenly ) localized , the few atoms involved in the db being the only ones with a significant motion whereas all other ones are almost frozen .",

    "maximum kinetic energies observed during a 200 ps md simulation are given , when the highest - frequency mode of the elastic network is excited with 20 kcal / mole .",
    ", width=8 ]    interestingly , dbs tend to appear in the most rigid parts of a structure  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that most of them are related to one of the high - frequency modes of the elastic network . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the more energetic a db is , the higher its frequency  @xcite , the more localized  @xcite and the more different it is from the high - frequency mode it comes from  @xcite . as a consequence , a way to obtain dbs is to provide energy to one of the high - frequency modes of the network  @xcite .",
    "because energetic dbs are highly localized , such a protocol allows to pinpoint a few specific residues ( a single one per high - frequency mode  ) .",
    "discrete breather arising from the highest - frequency mode of _ dictyostelium discoideum _ myosin ( pdb 1vom , @xmath28 = 10 ) .",
    "maximum kinetic energies observed during a 200 ps md simulation are given , when the highest - frequency mode of the elastic network is excited with 40 kcal / mole .",
    ", width=8 ]    for instance , in the case of the hiv - protease , exciting the highest - frequency mode highlights residues ile 85 and thr 31 ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : dbhiv ] to figs .",
    "[ fig : gnm ] and  [ fig : hivrig ] ) while , in the case of myosin , such an approach highlights residue ala 125 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dbmyo ] and compare to fig .",
    "[ fig : myorig ] ) .",
    "note that in both cases , more than 50% of the kinetic energy initially given to the highest - frequency mode of the system is observed , during the simulation , on a single residue  .",
    "the study of simple models where a protein is described as a set of hookean springs linking neighboring amino - acid residues often provides useful informations about its flexibility .",
    "noteworthy , the correlation between calculated residue fluctuations and experimental b - factors can be quite high ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bfcit ] ) .",
    "moreover , in many cases , a few low - frequency modes are found able to provide a fair description of the functional motion of a protein ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : overlapgk ] and  [ fig : gkmod7 ] ) .",
    "this is far from being an obvious result since , for instance , the energy function of a set of hookean springs has a single minimum , while a conformational change is expected to involve ( at least ) two significantly different minima of the potential energy surface .",
    "interestingly , modes involved in functional motions were also found to be robust  @xcite , that is , very little sensitive to changes in the model used to describe the protein .",
    "actually , the robustness of a small subset of the lowest - frequency modes of a protein explains why coarse - grained models can be used on the same footing as highly detailed ones , as far as low - frequency ( and large amplitude ) motions are concerned .",
    "reciprocally , seeking for robust modes allows to get a small set of coordinates ( eigenvectors ) able to provide a fair description of the functional motion a given protein can perform .",
    "more surprisingly , high - frequency modes of cutoff - based elastic networks may also prove useful .",
    "indeed , they pinpoint parts of the structure where the residue density ( in a coarse - grained sense ) is the highest , and it seems that such parts can be important for the proper folding  @xcite and/or for the function  @xcite of many proteins .",
