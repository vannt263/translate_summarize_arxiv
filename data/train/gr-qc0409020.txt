    "the causal interpretation , introduced by de - broglie@xcite and bohm@xcite , presents a definite trajectory for any quantum system .",
    "it is proved that copenhagen and causal interpretations answers to any _ common _ question are the same .",
    "there are questions _",
    "specific _ to causal interpretation , directly related to the trajectories which can not be asked in copenhagen interpretation .",
    "thus it is not simply another way of interpreting the same theory .",
    "but the problem that whether such questions are physical or not is still unclear@xcite .",
    "the causal interpretation is motivated by the fact that the phase of the wave function for a non relativistic particle obeys the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation modified by a potential called _",
    "quantum potential_. interpreting this equation as a quantum hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation one can derive the quantum trajectory .",
    "the power of this interpretation comes to the scene when one considers problems like measurement .",
    "it gives a deterministic version of measurement theory with the same results as the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "extension of the theory to the case of relativistic particles@xcite and fields@xcite is straightforward .",
    "it is also possible to make a causal interpretation of quantum gravity in terms of old variables@xcite .",
    "here we shall investigate the possibility of making a causal interpretation of quantum gravity in terms of new variables@xcite(loop quantum gravity ) .",
    "_ causal loop quantum gravity _ may be useful at least in three points .",
    "the first point is the issue of time . in loop",
    "quantum cosmology the notion of time can be introduced either internally , or externally . in the first view the scalar constraint",
    "is looked at as an evolution equation with respect to the eigenvalues of momentum@xcite . in the second view",
    "one introduces an external time which parameterizes quantum theory@xcite .",
    "it has no physical meaning but provides time dependent states , called _",
    "_ state  time__@xcite .",
    "the time issue in bohm s theory is different from these two definitions of time . in bohmian mechanics",
    "the guidance relation connects canonical momentum to the gradient of the hamilton  jacobi function .",
    "therefore one has a definite trajectory parameterized by this time , which is exactly the physical time for classical trajectory . in this case",
    "there is no approximation and if matter exists , one can eliminate the coordinate time , using the evolution of the matter fields , and introduce a clock field .",
    "another point is the evolution of the universe through the big bang singularity .",
    "it is shown @xcite that in loop quantum cosmology the quantum evolution is well defined through the big bang singularity .",
    "investigation of existence or non  existence of singularity in causal loop quantum cosmology , means looking for any possible singularity in bohmian trajectory .",
    "it is a general feature of de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory that it is quiet possible to have singularity in the wave function without any singularity in the trajectory .",
    "the last point is about the role of the wave function .",
    "causal quantum theory can talk about single systems , like universe , without any reference to the probabilistic character of the wave function .",
    "also in this theory , there is no need to have a classical system outside the observed system ( the observer ) to interpret the measurement problem .",
    "this shows the usability of the application of de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory to quantum cosmology .    in the next section",
    "we drive the guidance relation for loop quantum gravity and in section 3 we shall evaluate it for the cosmology minisuperspace . in section 4",
    "we shall find exact solutions and their bohmian trajectories .",
    "loop quantum gravity is based on the formulation of general relativity in terms of @xmath0 connections ( @xmath1 ) and triads ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "einstein s equations are expressed in terms of three constraints .",
    "two of them ( gauge and 3diff constraints ) are kinematical and the last one ( the scalar or hamiltonian constraint ) is dynamical .    in loop quantum gravity",
    "the elementary variables are constructed from the above fields .",
    "they are holonomies along edges of a graph and smeared fluxes of triads through surfaces .",
    "these have quantum representations in the hilbert space of the functions of holonomies .",
    "an orthonormal basis for this kinematical hilbert space is spin networks which are eigenvectors of geometric operators and depends on the connection via holonomies .    in order to have a causal interpretation of any quantum theory",
    ", one needs a guidance relation as well as the wave function .",
    "the guidance relation enables one to derive bohmian trajectories from the phase of the wave function . for the case of loop quantum gravity the wave functional",
    "is obtained by solving the above mentioned three constraints .",
    "the guidance relation can be obtained by using the poisson bracket between holonomies and fluxes .",
    "therefore if we denote the holonomy along an edge @xmath3 as @xmath4 and the electric flux through a surface @xmath5 as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the 2-form dual of the electric field @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the barbero ",
    "immirizi parameter and @xmath10 is a test function . )",
    ", we have the commutation relation@xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 equals to + 1(-1 ) if @xmath3 lies above ( below ) @xmath5 and zero otherwise and @xmath13 is the point that the surface @xmath5 intersects with the edge @xmath3 .",
    "let us now derive the guidance equation .",
    "first consider a simple case when we have a poisson bracket like @xmath14 .",
    "the quantum system would have the commutation relation @xmath15=i\\hbar x(\\hat{q})$ ] , leading to the q - representation @xmath16 and thus the bohmian relation @xmath17 .",
    "the extension to our case would be : @xmath18 thus in order to derive the bohmian trajectories one should first solve the three quantum constraints and obtain the wave functional . then denoting @xmath19 times the phase of the wave functional as @xmath20 , we can use the above guidance relation to obtain the quantum dynamics of the geometry .",
    "we shall do this for cosmological minisuperspace in the following section .",
    "using the spatial homogeneity and isotropy of cosmological models one can find solutions of the 3diff and gauss constraints@xcite .",
    "the elementary variables are holonomies along straight edges and fluxes across squares .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space is made from gauge invariant isotropic states which depends on the connection via the holonomies and form an orthonormal basis .",
    "in such a minisuperspace the connection has only one degree of freedom @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the scale factor and @xmath23 is the curvature parameter for a flat and closed model respectively , and the conjugate momentum is @xmath13 with @xmath24 .",
    "the action of scalar constraint after regularization and quantization on physical states leads to the following difference equation@xcite : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the eigenvalue of @xmath13 , @xmath29 is a quantum ambiguity coming from regularization@xcite , @xmath30 is the matter hamiltonian , and @xmath31 is the planck length .",
    "@xmath32 is the spin connection related to the curvature parameter such that @xmath33 for the flat and close universe respectively .",
    "@xmath34 are coefficients of the expansion of the state in terms of spin network states : @xmath35 in which @xmath36 represents matter fields and @xmath37 is the eigenvalue of the volume operator . in order to the sum make sense , one should add the condition that @xmath34 has support only on a countable subset of real numbers .",
    "the gauge invariant isotropic state can be represented by @xmath38 which form an orthonormal basis .",
    "the presence of @xmath29 is related to the quantum ambiguity and it can be fixed by minimal area of the full theory .",
    "as one may expect , the discrete evolution in terms of internal time @xmath28 does not break at big bang , this leads to resolution of singularity problem in quantum cosmology@xcite . at scales",
    "enough larger than @xmath29 , the differential wdw equation emerges as an approximation@xcite .",
    "also there is a lot of works done on effective field equation which incorporate quantum corrections to frw equations@xcite .    in order to have a causal interpretation",
    ", one needs the guidance relation .",
    "it can be derived from the guidance relation of the full theory given by the relation ( [ guide ] ) by going to the minisuperspace of cosmology .",
    "taking @xmath39 , since the holonomy for an edge of length @xmath28 is @xmath40 , using the relation ( [ guide ] ) , we have : @xmath41 in the next section we shall solve for the wave function in the absence of matter and derive the bohmian trajectory .",
    "for simplicity here we shall restrict ourselves to vacuum solutions of equation ( [ diff ] ) . in the vacuum case the difference equation ( [ diff ] )",
    "can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "note that for @xmath44 this leads to @xmath45 and thus does not determine @xmath46 . using the z  transform techniques , considering a solution of type @xmath47 , the above equation leads to : @xmath48 since the z ",
    "transform solution in the case @xmath49 is degenerate , one has a second solution of the form @xmath50 .",
    "therefore the general solution of equation ( [ diff ] ) is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are two constants .",
    "note that this is only for @xmath54 , and that @xmath46 is just another free parameter .    for large @xmath28",
    ", we have the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath55 the behavior of the wave function is plotted in figures ( [ b1]) ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from these figures that only for the case @xmath49 and @xmath56 , the wave function converges for large @xmath28 .",
    "the divergence in the other cases , is quiet similar to the results of @xcite . here",
    ", thus we choose the convergent case .",
    "as @xmath28 is a continuous variable , one can construct the general solution as the following form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some coefficient , and again has support only on a countable subset . in the above relation we have broken the sum over the real number @xmath28 into sum over a unit interval and an integer @xmath59 .",
    "the term @xmath60 in the above summation has the problem that setting @xmath61 leads to an infinite contribution .",
    "this suggests that one needs to introduce a condition on @xmath58 as @xmath62 and this makes a finite state .",
    "in order to get some physical details from the wave function ( [ wf ] ) , we restrict ourselves to the case that @xmath58 is equal to zero for all @xmath63 except a specific one , @xmath64 . to derive the bohmian trajectories",
    ", we use the wave function ( [ wf ] ) in the configuration space .",
    "one can get an approximate closed form for the physical wave function noting that for large @xmath65 ( i.e. grater than @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 introducing @xmath68 , the wave function is approximately : @xmath69 the last two terms can be summed to an integral form@xcite : @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the _ lerch _ @xmath72function @xmath73 .    to drive the bohmian trajectory one needs to extract the phase of the wave function in the configuration space . this can be done numerically .",
    "the result is plotted in figure ( [ b5 ] ) . in figure ( [ b6 ] ) the bohmian trajectory for the scale factor",
    "is plotted . in these figures",
    "we have used @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "as it is seen in figure ( [ b5 ] ) , the quantum hamilton  jacobi function has some oscillations around the classical hamilton  jacobi function ( @xmath77).constant ) , we have @xmath78constant and thus @xmath79 is a linear function in @xmath80 . ] as a result , bohmian trajectory in figure ( [ b6 ] ) is also oscillatory around the classical path , which is a constant scale factor in this case .      for simplicity",
    "we assume that the matter hamiltonian is such that , an initial state which is highly peaked at the classical solution , would be remained so for a long time .",
    "this condition is satisfied by choosing a gaussian distribution like : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the classical connection and @xmath83 is a complex function determining the width of the gaussian , and we denote its real and imaginary parts as : @xmath84 the scalar constraint ( [ diff ] ) , determines the dependence of width @xmath83 of the gaussian distribution on matter . here",
    "we shall assume that the state is so peaked at the classical path that one can make a classical approximation for matter field ( setting @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the classical matter field . ) .",
    "that is to say one can substitute matter fields in the guidance relation of the scale factor with its classical value .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi function is then given by : @xmath87 using the guidance relation and the fact that @xmath24 , the quantum path of the scale factor is given by the equation : @xmath88 therefore for such a semi  classical state the bohmian trajectories are fluctuations around the classical path .",
