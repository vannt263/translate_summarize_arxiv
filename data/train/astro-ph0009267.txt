    "since the early days of research on quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) have been considered as the most likely power sources of the activity in these objects @xcite .",
    "smbhs at the centers of all galaxies are now recognised as ubiquitous , whose mass @xmath0 is proportional to the spheroidal bulge mass of the host galaxy or the galactic bulge luminosity @xcite .",
    "evidence for the existence of smbhs has been found in the center of our galaxy @xcite and in the weakly active galaxies ngc 1068 , ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "asymmetric fe k@xmath1 emission in the x - ray spectra of agns ( e.g. , tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) may show a signature of smbhs , but this remains somewhat speculative as fe k@xmath1 reverberation signature have not yet been observed ( e.g. , reynolds 2000 ) .",
    "searches for smbhs are based on spatially resolved kinematics . in the case of agns , however , direct detection of nuclear smbhs through stellar - dynamical methods has not been achieved due to technical difficulties .",
    "the reason is that bright agns are too bright to resolve the light from the surrounding stars and gas , and from the agn itself on arcsecond and smaller angular scales .",
    "reverberation mapping @xcite avoids this problem . in this technique ,",
    "the time delayed response of the emission lines to continuum variations is used to infer a size of the line - emitting region .",
    "we also have a velocity @xmath2 , which is obtained from measurements of the doppler widths of the variable line components . combining these ,",
    "a virial mass is estimated by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant .",
    "on the other hand , several authors have pointed out that reverberation mapping yields systemically smaller smbh masses at a given bulge luminosity than do dynamical models of spatially resolved kinematics ( e.g. , wandel , perterson , & malkan 1999 ) . in the case of normal galaxies",
    ", the smbh mass appears to correlate with the galactic bulge luminosity , with the smbh to spheriodal bulge mass ratio @xmath5 @xcite . in the case of agns , however , a significantly lower value of @xmath6 has been found @xcite , indicating either a real difference between active and inactive galaxies , or that one or both of the methods of mass determination is somehow biased .",
    "@xcite claim that masses derived from reverberation mapping are consistent with the recently discovered relation between the smbh mass and the galaxy velocity dispersion derived from spatially resolved kinematics .",
    "another possible way to infer the presence of smbhs and to shed light on the physical condition is to examine spectral energy distribution over a wide range from the radio to the hard x - ray frequencies ( e.g. , frank et al .",
    "1992 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "this emission spectrum is produced by an accreting matter , as the surrounding gas accretes onto the central smbh . in",
    "such flows the core radio luminosity is low and dependent on the mass of the central smbh @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) are responsible for the observed radio and x - ray luminosities of some of the x - ray bright galactic nuclei @xcite . in this case",
    "the central smbh masses can be estimated directly from measurements of the x - ray and the core radio luminosities , provided that properties of such accretion flows are known .",
    "we demonstrate that it is relatively effective and consequently suitable to estimate smbh masses of many candidates using a method we present in this paper .",
    "this paper begins with model descriptions for the standard adaf model and modified versions of the model in @xmath7 2 .",
    "we deduce analytical expressions to describe the radio / x - ray luminosities for various models in @xmath7 2 .",
    "we present the calculated ratios of the luminosities and compare them with the observational data in @xmath7 3 .",
    "we discuss possible roles of the convection in adafs and conclude in @xmath7 4 .",
    "when a mass accretion rate is below a critical rate , the radiative cooling is slower than the viscous heating . as a result of this ,",
    "the dissipated accretion energy is inefficiently radiated away and advected inward to the central object with the accreted matter ( see narayan and yi 1995b and references therein ) .",
    "the ions are heated by viscous dissipation at a rate of @xmath8 per unit volume and the heating is parameterised by the viscosity parameter @xmath1 . since",
    "this flow is optically thin , the energy transfer from the ions to the electrons is inefficient so that the ions reach the virial temperature .",
    "the electrons cool via synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton processes .",
    "synchrotron radiation is responsible for the radio to submillimeter emission , bremsstrahlung emission and inverse - compton scattering are submillimeter to x - ray emission .",
    "detailed numerical calculations have been performed @xcite , and the resulting spectra have been successfully applied to a number of extra galactic systems which are supposed to harbor smbhs ( e.g. , narayan et al .",
    "1995 ; lasota et al . 1996 ; manmoto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in this study we apply analytical scaling laws for self - similar solutions @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following dimensionless variables : mass of the smbh @xmath9 ; radius from the smbh @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ; and mass accretion rate @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ( the eddington accretion rate assuming @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the flows are spherically symmeric .",
    "the advection fraction @xmath15 is determined such that the ion and electron energy balance equations are met .",
    "the quantities of interest are the volume - integrated quantities which are obtained by integrating the heating rate and each cooling rates throughout the volume of the flows . as canonical values in a model for adafs parameters",
    "are taken to be @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , narayan & yi 1995b ) . in this study , we assume that the electron temperature is constant for @xmath20 , as suggested by @xcite . for given @xmath21 , we may obtain the energy density spectrum with @xmath15 , @xmath22 determined as described below .",
    "the ions are heated by the viscous dissipation and the electrons gain energy from the ions by coulomb interactions alone .",
    "we neglect the possibility of heating the electrons , since we expect that the fraction of viscous energy transferred to the electrons is in the mass ratio of the electron to the ion , @xmath23 .",
    "the synchrotron photons are self - absorbed and give a blackbody radiation upto a critical frequency , @xmath24 .",
    "for a given @xmath22 , the synchrotron spectrum @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosity @xmath32 at @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 .",
    "the highest radio frequency arises from the innermost radius of the accretion flows , @xmath35 ; @xmath36 . at this peak frequency",
    "the peak radio luminosity is given by @xmath37 we obtain the total power due to synchrotron radiation from @xmath38 we set @xmath39 , since @xmath40 is much smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "in this study we neglect the comptonization of bremsstrahlung emission , and consider the comptonization of synchrotron emission alone .",
    "a contribution by compton up - scattered synchrotron photons to the hard x - ray luminosity becomes important as @xmath45 increases , while bremsstrahlung emission dominates the hard x - ray luminosity when @xmath45 is substantially low .",
    "we approximate the comptonized spectrum by assuming that all the synchrotron photons to be comptonized have an initial frequency of @xmath41 .",
    "the maximum final frequency of the comptonized photon is @xmath46 , which corresponds to the average energy of the photon for saturated comptonization in the wien regime . on average",
    ", we assume that all the photons would see one half the total optical depth @xcite , which is written as @xmath47 .",
    "the spectrum of the emerging photons at frequency @xmath33 has the power - law shape @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the total compton power is therefore given by @xmath50^{1-\\alpha_c}-1 \\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the mean amplification factor in a single scattering .",
    "for given @xmath21 , the total heating of the electrons should be balanced to the sum of the individual cooling , @xmath52 .",
    "the electron temperature is varied until this equality is satisfied .",
    "adafs have the positive bernoulli constant and , therefore , are susceptible to outflows @xcite .",
    "it might be the case that radio jets are present near the inner region of adafs .",
    "if so , the radio luminosity is dominated by jet emission .",
    "instead , radio emission due to adafs at the high frequency will be supressed . in order to simulate this situation ,",
    "we truncate adafs at a certain inner radius .",
    "we suppose that the truncation occurs at @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , an observation of ngc 4486 ( m87 ) indicates that the jet is formed in a smaller radius than @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this is slso about where is the maximum radius that 15 ghz radio emission could be generated for @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath56 .",
    "we set @xmath57 in equations in the previous subsection to @xmath53 instead of @xmath58 in corresponding equations in this case .",
    "since the gas in adaf solutions is generically unbound , winds may carry away infalling matter ( see , e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ; di matteo et al . 1999 ; quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "we allow @xmath45 to vary as @xmath59 ( see , e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ) .",
    "the mass loss causes a significant effect on a model spectrum for a large value of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "bremsstrahlung emission decreases with increasing @xmath60 , synchrotron emission decreases strongly with increasing @xmath60 due both to the lower density and to the lower @xmath22 near @xmath61 .",
    "compton emission decreases with increasing @xmath60 even more strongly than the other two emissions since it depends both on @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "a wind model is incompatible with observation , if microphysics parameters we adopt in the standard adaf model are more or less correct .",
    "this conclusion , however , is inconclusive since there are qualitative degeneracies between the wind parameter , @xmath60 , and microphysics parameters , @xmath64 , particularly the viscous heating paramter of the electrons , @xmath65 @xcite . as @xmath45 is replaced by @xmath66 equations for the standard adafs",

    "<S> we compare the observed ratio of the luminosities with predictions from models of optically thin accretion flows . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possible effects of the convection in adafs . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass estimate is possible with the radio / x - ray luminosity relation due to adaf models in the absence of a radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that observational data are insufficient to distinguish the standard adaf model from its modified models . </S>",
