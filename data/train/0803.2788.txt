    "mechanical resonators at the micro- and nano - meter scale are now widely employed in the high - sensitive detection of mass and forces @xcite . among the applications that have become possible",
    "are measurements of forces between individual biomolecules @xcite , forces arising from magnetic resonance of single spins @xcite , and perturbations that arise from mass fluctuations involving single atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "the recent improvements in the nanofabrication techniques suggest that in the near future these devices will reach the regime in which their sensitivity will be limited by the ultimate quantum limits set by the heisenberg principle , as first suggested in the context of the detection of gravitational waves by the pioneering work of braginsky and coworkers @xcite .",
    "an important step in this direction would be the demonstration of cooling such microresonators to their quantum ground state .",
    "it would represent a remarkable signature of the quantum behavior of a macroscopic object , allowing to shed further light onto the quantum - classical boundary @xcite .",
    "recent experiments achieved promising results via cryogenic cooling @xcite , via back - action cooling , in which the off - resonant operation of the cavity results in a retarded back action on the mechanical system @xcite , or by cold - damping quantum feedback where the oscillator position is measured through a phase - sensitive detection of the cavity output and the resulting photocurrent is used for a real - time correction of the dynamics @xcite .",
    "as shown by recent theoretical results @xcite , these cooling scheme are in principle capable to bring the microresonator down to its ground state . both mechanisms achieve cooling by increasing the damping of the mechanical resonator so that it becomes insensitive to thermal noise .",
    "it is important to analyze all the possible limitations to ground state cooling , also because this would open up the experimental realization of a number of genuinely quantum phenomena , such as the possibility of entangling an acoustic mode to a cavity quantum field @xcite , or to another mechanical oscillator @xcite , and even continuous variable quantum information protocols such as quantum teleportation @xcite , and entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "here we shall consider only back - action cooling and the prototypal situation of an optical fabry - perot cavity with a rigid massive mirror at one end and a lighter , vibrating mirror at the opposite end .",
    "an intense laser beam drives a single , well separated , cavity mode which excites many internal vibrational modes of the oscillating mirror , via the radiation pressure .",
    "all the theoretical treatments of back - action cooling have up to now focused on a single cavity mode-_single mechanical mode _ interaction , which is justified when a bandpass filter in the detection scheme is used , because coupling between the different vibrational modes is typically negligible .    in this paper",
    "we extend the treatment of cooling by including the effect of secondary acoustic modes whose resonance frequency is not far from that of the mechanical mode of interest , so that they can not be neglected and filtered out by the detection process .",
    "we specialize to the case of a single additional mode and study its effect on cooling and on the entanglement properties of the steady state of the system .",
    "we find that cooling of the main mode crucially depends upon the difference between the two mechanical resonance frequencies .",
    "if this difference is larger than the effective damping of the secondary mode , cooling is not crucially affected by the presence of the adjacent mode , and the cavity mode is capable of _ simultaneously cooling _ the nearby mechanical mode close to its ground state . in this regime",
    "the cavity mode is entangled to each mechanical mode and the stationary state shows fully tripartite entanglement .",
    "if instead the two mechanical frequencies are closer than the effective mechanical damping , then the two cooling processes interfere destructively and each mechanical mode is no more cooled .",
    "this destructive interference affects also the stationary entanglement , which becomes extremely fragile with respect to temperature .",
    "the steady state of the system becomes a two - mode biseparable state , ( i.e. , of `` class 3 '' @xcite ) , which means inseparable only when one splits the cavity mode from the two mechanical modes .",

    "however , such an entanglement is very fragile with respect to temperature , and vanishes at @xmath198 k ( c ) for a wide interval around the resonance condition .",
    "this behavior can be understood using the arguments of the preceding section . at mechanical resonance ,",
    "the cavity mode is strongly coupled , and entangled , to the center - of - mass , and uncoupled from the relative coordinate .",
    "modes 1 and 2 are linear combinations of @xmath200 and @xmath180 and therefore their entanglement with the cavity mode is determined by both @xmath200 and @xmath180 . at @xmath201 , both mode 1 and mode 2 are entangled with the cavity mode thanks to the cavity - center - of - mass entanglement and because the quantum fluctuations of @xmath180 do not significantly affect it . however , as soon as temperature is increased , the thermal fluctuations of the uncoupled coordinate @xmath180 kill the entanglement of modes 1 and 2 with the cavity , even though cavity - center - of - mass entanglement is robust against temperature .",

    "we have chosen @xmath213 , such that a simultaneous entanglement regime is obtained.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    one can also check if the two mechanical modes , even though not directly interacting , can become entangled at the steady state thanks to the common interaction with the cavity mode . eliminating the entries in @xmath78 that correspond to the cavity field ,",
    "one is left with an all mechanical correlation matrix @xmath214 a numerical analysis of @xmath215 in a parameter regime around the region of optimal cooling , i.e. , that of figs .  [ cooling ] and [ entanglement ] , shows no entanglement between the two mechanical modes , even when they are both strongly entangled to the same cavity field .",
    "nonzero but extremely weak bipartite mechanical entanglement can be instead obtained in a regime where the oscillators are heavily damped and the cavity finesse is very high ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , where bipartite entanglement between two different macroscopic oscillators is analyzed .",
    "in fact , the present system is analogous to that of ref .",

    "we determine the entanglement class of the system state by applying the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which has provided a necessary and sufficient criterion for the determination of the class in the case of tripartite cv gaussian states and which is directly computable .",
    "this classification criterion is mostly based on the nonpositive partial transposition ( npt ) criterion proved in @xcite , which is necessary and sufficient for @xmath217 bipartite cv gaussian states .",

    "transposition is equivalent to time reversal and therefore in phase space is equivalent to change the sign of the momentum operators .",
    "the npt criterion states that a @xmath221 cv gaussian state is separable if and only if the `` test matrix '' @xmath222 .",
    "therefore by evaluating the sign of the eigenvalues of the three possible matrices @xmath223 , and using the npt criterion , one can discriminate between the various entanglement classes .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "we find again that the properties of the steady state crucially depend upon the comparison between the difference between the two mechanical frequencies @xmath224 and the effective mechanical damping @xmath225 .",
    "when @xmath226 , the system is a fully tripartite state in a wide parameter region around the optimal cooling regime studied here , because the minimum eigenvalues for each bipartition are always negative ( see fig .  [ trip](a ) ) . instead , when the two frequencies are very close to each other ( @xmath227 ) , we see from fig .",
    "[ trip](b ) that two eigenvalues , those corresponding to isolate a mechanical mode from the other two modes , are always positive , in a wide interval for the detunings .",
    "this means that the steady state is of _ class 3 _ , i.e. , a two - mode biseparable state @xcite , which is separable when the bipartite splits corresponding to isolate one of the two mechanical modes are considered , but inseparable when the cavity mode is split from the rest .",
    "this can be understood by recalling again that when @xmath157 , the cavity mode is strongly coupled with the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath200 and decoupled from the relative coordinate @xmath180 .",
    "the tripartite biseparable state manifests the fact that the cavity is entangled with the center of mass , of the two oscillators .",

    "we have seen that the result crucially depends upon the difference between the two mechanical resonance frequencies .",
    "if this difference is larger than the effective bandwidth of the mechanical oscillators , given by the effective damping , the second mode not only does not affect cooling , but it is simultaneously cooled together with the main mode . under the same condition , each mode is entangled with the cavity mode and the steady state is a fully tripartite entangled state .",
