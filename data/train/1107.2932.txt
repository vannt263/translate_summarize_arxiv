    "understanding strong dynamics constitutes a continuous challenge .",
    "one facet of strong dynamics which is attracting much interest is the phase diagram of strongly interacting nonsupersymmetric gauge theories as a function of the number of flavors , colors and matter representations .",
    "the investigation of the phase diagram for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories , without fundamental scalars , for any matter representation , and several gauge groups , started in @xcite and it was further investigated in @xcite . besides the possibility of infrared fixed points recently it has been discovered that nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with fermionic matter at large number of flavors develop ultraviolet fixed points @xcite . furthermore , as soon as it was discovered that theories with an extremely low number of matter flavors were able to lead to large distance conformality and potentially become excellent candidates of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking , the question whether these theories could feature light composite scalars was addressed in @xcite .",
    "these papers rekindled the long debate on the existence of a light scalar compared to the intrinsic scale of the theory .",
    "their phenomenological relevance resides on the identification of this state with the composite higgs in models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking featuring near conformal dynamics or the inflaton in models of successful minimal composite conformal inflation @xcite .",
    "a variety of arguments has been used in favor of the existence of a light scalar , not associated to goldstone bosons linked to the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries .",
    "furthermore , there has been used a number of methods ranging from the use of the saturation of the trace and axial anomaly @xcite to supersymmetry @xcite , alternative large n limits @xcite as well as gauge - gauge duality @xcite .",
    "other interesting attempts to investigate the dynamics associated to light scalars in near conformal field theories appeared in the literature @xcite .    the suggestions of potential light dilatons for theories with near conformal invariance resided mostly on nonperturbative analysis and the use of critical behavior which should be backed up by either lattice or exact analytical computations .",
    "here we investigate the perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics of a particular gauge theory , similar to the one investigated in @xcite , which allows us to clearly identify the dilaton and determine its properties using perturbation theory and even to be able to determine exactly some nonperturbative quantities arising at low energies .",

    "<S> we investigate the infrared dynamics of a nonsupersymmetric su(x ) gauge theory featuring an adjoint fermion , @xmath0 dirac flavors and an higgs - like complex @xmath1 scalar which is a gauge singlet . </S>",
    "<S> we first establish the existence of an infrared stable perturbative fixed point and then investigate the spectrum near this point . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this theory features a light scalar degree of freedom to be identified with the dilaton and elucidate its physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the spectrum and demonstrate that at low energy the nonperturbative part of the spectrum of the theory is the one of pure supersymmetric yang - mills . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore determine the exact nonperturbative fermion condensate and deduce relevant properties of the nonperturbative spectrum of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the intrinsic scale of super yang - mills is exponentially smaller than the scale associated to the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetry of the theory . </S>",
