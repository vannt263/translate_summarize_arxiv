    "light - front quantization  @xcite is a natural choice for the nonperturbative solution of a quantum field theory .",
    "the eigenstates are built as expansions in terms of fock states , states of definite particle number and definite momentum , where the coefficients are boost - invariant wave functions .",
    "the vacuum state is simply the fock vacuum , thereby giving the wave functions a standard , quantum mechanical interpretation .",
    "the light - front time coordinate is chosen to be @xmath1 , and the corresponding light - front spatial coordinate is @xmath2 ; the other spatial coordinates are unchanged .",
    "the conjugate light - front energy is @xmath3 , and the light - front longitudinal momentum is @xmath4 .",
    "a boost - invariant momentum fraction @xmath5 is defined for the ith particle with momentum @xmath6 in a system with total momentum @xmath7 . because the light - front longitudinal momentum is always positive , these momentum fractions are between zero and one .",
    "also , momentum conservation dictates that they sum to one .    in the three - particle case",
    ", the three momentum fractions correspond to the barycentric coordinates of a triangle .",
    "any two can be treated as the independent variables . for a wave function that describes three identical bosons",
    ", there must be symmetry under the interchange of any two of the three coordinates , not just symmetry under the interchange of the two chosen as independent .",
    "any set of basis functions to be used in numerical approximations of such a wave function should share this symmetry .",
    "however , the usual treatment of two - variable polynomials on a triangle is limited to consideration of symmetry with respect to only the two independent variables  @xcite . here",
    "we consider the full - symmetry constraint .",
    "we find that full symmetry among all three barycentric coordinates dramatically reduces the number of polynomials at any given order .",
    "for the lowest orders , there is only one ; at the sixth order , there are two . in general , for polynomials of order @xmath8 ,",
    "the number of linearly independent polynomials is the number of combinations of two nonnegative integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "these polynomials can be chosen to be products of @xmath9 factors of the second - order polynomial and @xmath10 factors of the third - order polynomial .",
    "they are not orthonormal , but given such a set of polynomials one can , of course , systematically generate an orthonormal set .    as a test of the utility of these polynomials , we consider a problem in two - dimensional @xmath0 theory where the mass of the eigenstate is shifted by coupling between the one - boson sector and the three - boson sector .",
    "the results obtained are quite encouraging . for comparison",
    "we also consider discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq )  @xcite which uses a periodic plane - wave basis and therefore quadratures in momentum space that use equally spaced points .",
    "the dlcq results would require extrapolation to obtain an accurate answer , whereas the symmetric - polynomial basis immediately converges .",
    "the content of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : polynomials ] , we specify the construction of the fully symmetric polynomials . the first subsection describes the lowest order cases , where a first - order polynomial is found to be absent and the second and third - order polynomials are found to be unique .",
    "the second subsection gives the analysis at any finite order , with details of a proof left to an appendix .",
    "the illustration of the use of these polynomials , as a basis for the three - boson wave function in @xmath0 theory , is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : illustration ] .",
    "a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider polynomials in cartesian coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , on the triangle defined by 0x 1 , 0y 1 , 01-x - y 1 , that are fully symmetric with respect to interchange of the coordinates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "these can be viewed as the restriction of three - variable polynomials on the unit cube to the plane @xmath15 .",
    "the construction of the fully symmetric three - variable polynomials on the cube is trivial ; at order @xmath8 , the possible polynomials are linear combinations of the form x^i y^j z^k+ x^j y^k",
    "z^i + x^k y^i z^j + x^j y^i z^k + x^i y^k z^j+x^k y^j z^i , with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 nonnegative integers such that @xmath19 .",
    "the linearly independent polynomials would correspond to some particular ordering of these indices , such as @xmath20 . for @xmath21 or 1",
    "there is only one polynomial , but for @xmath22 there are several .",
    "the restriction to the plane defined by @xmath15 is , however , a severe constraint .",
    "as we will see , the fully symmetric two - variable polynomials are unique up through @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the constraint eliminates the only candidate ; the restriction from the cube to the plane makes @xmath25 just a constant . for @xmath26 , we have two candidates x^2+y^2+z^2 xy+xz+yz . substitution of @xmath14 quickly shows that they are equivalent up to terms of order less than two .",
    "similarly , for @xmath27 , the three candidates x^3+y^3+z^3 , x^2y+x^2z+xy^2+xz^2+y^2z+yz^2 , xyz reduce to equivalent polynomials , up to terms of order less than three , upon substitution of @xmath14 .",
    "equivalence does not exclude the possibility that the polynomials will differ by fully symmetric polynomials of lower order .",
    "the terms of order three are the same , and the polynomials differ by at most symmetric polynomials of lower order .",
    "to proceed in this fashion to higher orders is , of course , possible but tedious .",
    "instead we develop a direct analysis of the possible two - variable polynomials and the symmetry constraints , as described in the next subsection .      in order to avoid complications due to lower - order contributions , we first change variables from @xmath28 to @xmath29 defined by [ eq : uvw ] u = x-1/3 , v = y-1/3 , w = z-1/3=-(u+v ) .",
    "any polynomial @xmath30 on the triangle , for which each term is of order @xmath8 , can be written in the form p(u , v)=_n=0^n c_n u^n v^n - n , and , unlike replacement of @xmath12 or @xmath13 by @xmath14 , powers of @xmath31 that appear in replacements of @xmath32 or @xmath33 do not introduce lower - order contributions .",
    "symmetry with respect to just @xmath32 and @xmath33 restricts the coefficients to be such that @xmath34 .",
    "if symmetry with respect to @xmath35 is imposed , the coefficients must satisfy the constraint [ eq : u+v ] _",
    "n=0^n c_n u^n - n v^n = _ n=0,n c_n u^n - n ( -1)^n ( u+v)^n = _ n=0^n",
    "c_n u^n - n ( -1)^n_m=0^n (    c n + m    ) u^n - mv^m",
    ". these are sufficient to guarantee that the resulting polynomial has all the desired symmetries .",
    "the symmetry conditions can be reduced to a linear system for the coefficients . with a change in the order of the sums on the right of ( [ eq : u+v ] ) and an interchange of the summation indices @xmath10 and @xmath9 , we find _",
    "n=0^nc_n u^n - n v^n = _ n=0^n _ m = n^n ( -1)^m (    c m + n    ) c_m u^n - n v^n . therefore , the coefficients must satisfy the linear system c_n = c_n - n , _",
    "m = n^n ( -1)^m (    c m + n    ) c_m = c_n .",
    "this system may at first seem to be overdetermined , but instead it is typically underdetermined .",
    "a solution exists for any @xmath8 other than @xmath24 . for @xmath36 , and",
    "5 , there is one linearly independent solution ; and , for @xmath37 , there can be two or more linearly independent solutions .",
    "for example , with @xmath38 the system can be expressed in matrix form as (    ccccccc 0 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 + 0 & -2 & 2 & -3 & 4 & -5 & 6 + 0 & 0 & 0 & -3 & 6 & -10 & 15 + 0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 4 & -10 & 20 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -5 & 15 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -2 & 6 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0    ) (    c c_0 + c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_2 + c_1 + c_0    ) = (    c 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0    ) .",
    "the determinant is obviously zero , as is the case for any @xmath8 , allowing nontrivial solutions .",
    "the system reduces to two equations 3c_0-c_1=0 , 5 c_0 - 2 c_2 + c_3=0 for the four unknowns , leaving two linearly independent solutions , such as u^6 + 3 u^5 v + 5 u^3v^3 + 3 u v^5 + v^6 u^4 v^2 + 2 u^3v^3+u^2 v^4 . for any value of @xmath8",
    ", one finds that the number of independent solutions is always the number of ways that @xmath8 can be written as @xmath39 for nonnegative integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 . a proof of this conjecture for arbitrary @xmath8 is given in the appendix .",
    "thus , in each of these cases , a fully symmetric polynomial can be chosen to be the product of @xmath9 copies of the second - order polynomial and @xmath10 copies of the third - order polynomial , or a linear combination of such polynomials .",
    "returning to the original cartesian coordinates , we take these two base polynomials to be [ eq : basepolys ] c_2(x , y)=x^2+y^2+(1-x - y)^2 c_3(x , y)=xy(1-x - y ) .",
    "we then have that all fully symmetric polynomials can be constructed from linear combinations of the products [ eq : cnm ] c_nm(x , y)=c_2^n(x , y ) c_3^m(x , y ) .",
    "these do not form an orthonormal set .",
    "to construct such a set , we apply the gramm ",
    "schmidt process , relative to the inner product _",
    "0 ^ 1 dx _ 0 ^ 1-x dy p_n^(i)(x , y ) p_m^(j)(x , y ) = _ nm_ij , where @xmath40 is the ith polynomial of order @xmath9 .",
    "the first few polynomials are [ eq : firstfew ] p_0&= & , + p_1&=&0 , + p_2&= & , + p_3&= & , + p_4&= & , + p_5&= & , + p_6^(1)&= & , + p_6^(2)&=&. if there is only one polynomial at a particular order , the @xmath16 index is dropped .",
    "as a sample application , we consider the integral equation for the three - boson wave function in two - dimensional @xmath0 theory .",
    "this equation is obtained from the fundamental hamiltonian eigenvalue problem on the light front  @xcite , p^-|(p^+)=|(p^+ ) ^+|(p^+)=p^+|(p^+ ) .",
    "the second equation is automatically satisfied by expanding the eigenstate in fock states @xmath41 of @xmath9 bosons with momentum @xmath6 such that @xmath42 :    here @xmath43 is the @xmath9-boson wave function , and the factor @xmath44 is explicit in order that @xmath43 be independent of @xmath7 .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian for @xmath0 theory is [ eq : pminus ] p^-&=&dp^+ a^(p^+)a(p^+ ) + & & + + & &    ' '' ''     + & & + ( p_1^+ + p_2^+-p_1^+-p_2^+ ) + & &    ' '' ''    a^(p_1^+ ) a^(p_2^+ ) a(p_1^+ ) a(p_2^+ ) .",
    "the mass of the constituent bosons is @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the coupling constant .",
    "the operator @xmath47 creates a boson with momentum @xmath48 ; it obeys the commutation relation = ( p^+-p^+ ) and builds the fock states from the fock vacuum @xmath49 in the form |x_ip^+;p^+,n=_i=1^n a^(x_ip^+)|0 .",
    "the terms of the light - front hamiltonian are such that @xmath50 changes particle number not at all or by two ; therefore , the number of constituents in a contribution to the eigenstate is always either odd or even .",
    "we consider the odd case , and , to have a finite eigenvalue problem , we truncate the fock - state expansion at three bosons . we also simplify to a problem with an exact solution by dropping from the hamiltonian the two - body scattering term , the last term in ( [ eq : pminus ] ) .",
    "the action of the light - front hamiltonian then yields the following coupled system of integral equations : m^2_1&=&^2_1 + _ 3(x_1,x_2,x_3 ) , + m^2_3&=&^2(++)_3 + .",
    "it is understood that @xmath51 .    to create a single integral equation for @xmath52",
    ", we use the first equation to eliminate @xmath53 from the second , leaving m^2_3=^2(++)_3 - _ 3(x_1,x_2,x_3 ) .",
    "this is no longer a simple eigenvalue problem for @xmath54 , but it can be rearranged into an eigenvalue problem for the reciprocal of a dimensionless coupling , defined as = 6(1-m^2/^2)()^2 .",
    "the rearrangement yields _ 3=^-1 _ 3(x_1,x_2,x_3 ) . to symmetrize the kernel of this equation",

    "this rearrangement also accomplishes an important step toward the use of a polynomial expansion",
    ". the leading small-@xmath55 behavior of @xmath52 is @xmath56 , and , as can be seen from the structure of the pre - factor in ( [ eq : f3 ] ) , the leading behavior of @xmath57 is just a constant .    because the kernel factorizes , the equation can be solved analytically .",
    "the function @xmath57 must be of the form f_3(x_1,x_2,x_3)= ^-1/2 , with a normalization @xmath58 .",
