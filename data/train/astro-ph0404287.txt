    "their outburst spectra are relatively hard and x - ray pulsations from these highly magnetized ( @xmath13  g ) neutron stars are typically detected .",
    "a wide variety of x - ray behaviors are seen for neutron star lmxbs , but , in general , the lack of x - ray pulsations from most ( but not all ) of these systems , and the emission of type i x - ray bursts from some , suggest that they harbor neutron stars with relatively low magnetic field strengths ( @xmath14  g ) . during @xmath15 years of x - ray observations ,",
    "some sources ( e.g. , sco x-1 , cyg x-2 ) have maintained luminosities approaching the eddington limit of @xmath16 ergs  s@xmath5 , while others are able to maintain persistent luminosities several orders of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a class of transient neutron star lmxbs for which the luminosity varies from a substantial fraction of eddington to quiescent levels typically near @xmath17 ergs  s@xmath5 . in outburst",
    ", these systems have relatively soft spectra compared to the hmxbs , and are commonly grouped with black hole transients as soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) .    in quiescence ,",
    "most neutron star sxts exhibit x - ray energy spectra with a component that is typically fitted well by a blackbody , suggesting that the origin of this component is thermal emission from the surface of a cooling neutron star .",
    "although a pure blackbody often provides a good fit to the spectrum , unphysical neutron star radii near 1 km are inferred unless an atmosphere is modeled @xcite .",
    "in addition to the thermal component , the energy spectra often contain a second component that has a power - law shape .",
    "the brightest and best studied systems in this class , cen x-4 and aql x-1 , usually display both components @xcite . however",
    ", other systems may be dominated by the thermal component , such as mxb 165929 @xcite and sources x-5 and x-7 in the globular cluster 47 tucanae @xcite , or by the power - law component , such as sax j1808.43658 @xcite and exo 1745248 @xcite . although theories for the thermal component , such as the deep crustal heating model of @xcite , are relatively well - developed and are being tested with observations , the origin of the power - law component is not understood beyond suggestions that it may be related to accretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite or a putative pulsar wind colliding with infalling matter from the companion star @xcite .",
    "in addition to our lack of understanding of the power - law component , questions remain about the mass accretion rate in quiescence , the origin of rapid ( 10010,000  s ) variability @xcite , and the origin of variability in the thermal component on longer time scales @xcite .",
    "another important question is if quiescent observational properties correlate with other known differences between neutron star sxts , such as whether they are millisecond x - ray pulsars ( during outbursts ) or not , whether the systems are in the field or in globular clusters , and whether their x - ray outbursts are long ( years to decades ) or short ( weeks to months ) .    here",

    "we note that this calibration is about 0.1 magnitudes brighter than the calibration previously obtained using mdm observations from 1998 reported in @xcite .",
    "we used the ciao software routine _",
    "psextract _ to produce the acis energy spectrum for xte j2123058 and to create the appropriate instrument response matrix for the spectrum . the software used caldb 2.23 to create the response matrix , and we included a correction for the time - dependence of the acis response . the source spectrum included counts from a circular region with a 5 pixel ( about @xmath35 ) radius , and we estimated the background level using counts from a source - free annulus around the target position .",
    "the source spectrum consists of 24 counts , and we estimate a background level of 0.7 counts in the extraction region .",
    "we produced a `` light curve '' of the source in six time bins of @xmath36  s. each bin contains between 2 and 6 counts , which is consistent with a constant flux ; however , the low count rate does not allow us to place tight constraints on the possible amplitude of variability .",
    "the small number of counts also indicates that @xmath37 statistics are not appropriate for spectral analysis , as the assumption of a gaussian probability distribution in each spectral bin is not met .",
    "thus , we carried out our spectral analysis by minimizing the cash statistic @xcite , which is appropriate in cases where the assumption of a poisson probability distribution in each spectral bin is valid .",
    "we fitted the spectrum using xspec 11.2 .",
    "the spectra of other neutron star sxts are typically well - described by a blackbody , a power - law , or both components with interstellar absorption .",
    "we began by fitting the spectrum for xte j2123058 with an absorbed power - law , and the results are given in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "once we found the best - fitted parameters by minimizing the cash statistic , we determined the quality of the fit and the 90% confidence errors on the parameters by producing and fitting 10,000 simulated spectra .",
    "we used the best - fitted parameters from the fits to the actual data as input to the simulations .",
    "using simulations to determine the parameter errors is necessary only because of the small number of counts in the spectrum .",
    "we tested our method by producing spectra with 23 times as many counts , and we found that the errors produced by calculating changes in the cash statistic ( the standard technique ) match the values we obtain using simulations .",
    "in addition to the power - law model , we used simulations to determine the errors on parameter for all other fits presented in this work . for the power - law model , we obtain @xmath38 @xmath39 for the column density and @xmath40 for the photon index .",
    "the fit using a blackbody model is significantly worse than the power - law model as indicated by the fact that for 97% of the simulated spectra we obtained a better cash statistic than the one obtained when fitting the actual spectrum ( compared to 69% for the power - law model ) .     fixed at the interstellar value .",
    "the power - law photon index is @xmath41 , and the unabsorbed 0.38 kev luminosity is @xmath2 ergs  s@xmath5 . a blackbody model ( _ dashed line _ ) , by itself ,",
    "does not provide a good description of the spectrum.[fig : spectrum],scaledwidth=52.0% ]    we refitted the spectrum with the same spectral models but with @xmath0 fixed to the interstellar column density .",
    "the interstellar @xmath0 comes from the @xmath42 measurement of @xcite , which gives @xmath43 @xmath39 , and the total galactic value of @xmath44 @xmath39 from @xcite .",

    "the best fitted blackbody temperature is @xmath47 ev , but the quality of the blackbody fit is even worse ( 98.7% ) with @xmath0 fixed .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectrum ( rebinned for clarity , although the cash fits are performed without rebinning ) along with the best fitted power - law and blackbody models with @xmath0 fixed .",
    "it is clear that the curvature of the blackbody model is too large , underpredicting the observed spectrum below 0.7 kev and above 2 kev .",
    "this , along with the measurements of the fit quality from the simulations , indicates that the spectrum is well - described by a power - law model or the combination of a blackbody and a power - law model , but it is not well - described by a blackbody alone .",
    "although a power - law alone provides an adequate description of the acis spectrum , we performed additional fits to obtain limits on the temperature and luminosity of the putative thermal component that is expected to be emitted from the surface of the neutron star .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a model consisting of a power - law component along with thermal emission from an atmosphere composed of hydrogen .",
    "the latter component was modeled using the `` neutron star atmosphere '' ( nsa ) model of @xcite .",
    "we assumed a neutron star mass of 1.4 , which is consistent with the measured mass , and a radius of 10  km . with these parameters fixed ,",
    "the remaining free parameters in the nsa model are the temperature ( @xmath48 ) and the distance . for xte j2123058 , there are several arguments that lead to distance estimates in the range 515 kpc @xcite , but the most reliable estimates come from optical observations of the source in quiescence .",
    "previous estimates include @xmath49 kpc @xcite , @xmath19 kpc @xcite , and @xmath50 kpc @xcite .",
    "here , we adopt a range of 611  kpc .",
    "we performed the nsa plus power - law fits with the distance fixed to three values spanning this range ( 6 , 8.5 , and 11 kpc ) . as shown in table  [ tab : nsa ] , the 90% confidence upper limits on @xmath48 are 57 , 66 , and 73 ev , respectively , for these three distances . using @xmath51 , where @xmath11 = 10 km and @xmath52 = 1.4 , upper limits on the unabsorbed luminosity from the nsa component as seen by a distant observer are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55",

    "although the precise value of @xmath89 depends on the exact shape of the outburst light curve , it can be approximated as the mean outburst flux divided by the peak flux .",
    "for the xte j2123058 asm light curve , the mean flux over a 60 day period that includes the 1998 outburst is 41% of the peak level , and we use @xmath95 , giving @xmath96 s@xmath4 @xmath39 . using this value of @xmath92 for all five sources and the values for @xmath80 and the number of outbursts ( @xmath87 ) given above , we calculate estimates of the time - averaged mass accretion rate over the past 33  years .",
    "the values for @xmath9@xmath72@xmath97 are given in table  [ tab : comparison ] , and they show that this quantity is a relatively good predictor of @xmath77 .",
    "aql x-1 and 4u 1608522 have the the highest values of both @xmath9@xmath72@xmath97 and @xmath77 , xte j2123058 and sax j1810.82609 have the lowest , and cen x-4 is intermediate .",
    "the ratio of the value of @xmath9@xmath72@xmath97 for aql x-1 to that for xte j2123058 is 45 , which is consistent with their ratio of @xmath77 , which is @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , the aql x-1 to sax j1810.82609 ratio of @xmath9@xmath72@xmath97 is 76 , and this is consistent with their ratio of @xmath77 , which is @xmath99 .",
    "while these measurements are in line with the @xcite theory , a caveat is that we can not be certain that x - ray flux history over the past 33 years reflects the behavior over the last 10,000 years .",
    "we can use the @xcite theory to predict the recurrence time for outbursts of xte j2123058 , assuming that the outbursts are similar . using @xmath100 and the expression relating @xmath75 to the time - averaged mass accretion rate , @xmath101 @xmath9@xmath72@xmath73  ergs  s@xmath5 , one obtains ( see also wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath102$](@xmath9@xmath103@xmath97/130 ) .",
    "here , @xmath104 is the average time the source spends in quiescence between outbursts , @xmath9@xmath103@xmath97 is the average luminosity during an outburst , and @xmath88 is defined above . for xte j2123058 , we used the _",
    "rxte_/asm light curve shown in figure  [ fig : asm]d to determine that the mean 1.512 kev count rate during the 40 days ( @xmath88 ) between mjd 50,990 and mjd 51,030 was 3.2 s@xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath9@xmath103@xmath97@xmath105 ergs  s@xmath5 for @xmath8 kpc . from the luminosity upper limit of @xmath106 ergs  s@xmath5 , we obtain a lower limit on the recurrence time , @xmath107 , of 67 years .",
    "the known outburst history of xte j2123058 , one outburst in 33 years , assuming that no outbursts were missed , is consistent with these long predicted recurrence times .",
    "however , if the recurrence time is in fact shorter than 67 years , then a mechanism of enhanced cooling of the core would be necessary .",
    "the most often mentioned mechanism is neutrino cooling of the core due to the direct urca process , and this mechanism requires a neutron star with a mass higher than 1.71.8@xcite . the mass of the neutron star in xte j2123058 has been measured at @xmath20  or 1.041.56 , so that the mass would have to be at the upper end of the error range for the direct urca process to operate .",
    "while we have been focusing primarily on the implications of the upper limit on the temperature and luminosity of the thermal component , it is notable that the power - law fit to the spectrum of xte j2123058 also indicates that its x - ray luminosity , at @xmath2 ergs  s@xmath5 in the unabsorbed 0.38  kev band , is among the lowest for neutron star sxts .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of sax j1810.82609 , @xmath108 ergs  s@xmath5 @xcite , is essentially the same as for xte j2123058 , and the only other system in this class known to have a lower quiescent x - ray luminosity , sax j1808.43658 , is also the only millisecond x - ray pulsar system for which there is a measurement of its quiescent x - ray spectrum .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of sax j1808.43658 is well described by a power - law with @xmath109 and a 0.510 kev unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath110 ergs  s@xmath5 , and the upper limit on the contribution from a thermal component is 10% of the total x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "if the spectrum of xte j2123058 consists of only a power - law component , then its @xmath1 is quite a bit softer than that of sax j1808.43658 , and the difference would have to be explained . on the other hand ,",
    "if the spectrum for xte j2123058 consists of a thermal component and a power - law , then its power - law could have the same slope as sax j1808.43658 .",
    "concerning the sax j1808.43658 thermal component , @xcite conclude that enhanced neutron star cooling is required to obtain a quiescent luminosity as low as the _ xmm - newton _ upper limit implies .",
    "however , as mentioned above , such conclusions depend on the assumption that the recent outburst behavior is indicative of the average mass accretion rate over the past 10,000 years .    in summary , our x - ray measurements of xte j2123058 in quiescence",
    "show that this system is one of the faintest and least luminous of the neutron star sxts .",
    "a comparison of the xte j2123058 x - ray properties in outburst and quiescence to that of four other neutron star sxts that exhibit short outbursts shows that the systems with a higher degree of outburst activity tend to have more luminous thermal components in quiescence , and this is in - line with predictions of the theory of deep crustal heating . for xte j2123058 ,",
    "the upper limit on the thermal luminosity is consistent with this theory without requiring enhanced neutron star cooling if the outburst recurrence time is @xmath9767 years , which is consistent with the known outburst history of this source .",
