    "there exists increasing experimental evidence that metamaterial samples , consisting of arrays of sub - wavelength scale nano - structured circuit elements , can be prepared in the limit where collective interactions between the resonators play a vital role in determining their electromagnetic ( em ) responses .",
    "for example , experiments on two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays of closely spaced asymmetric split ring ( asr ) meta - molecules have indicated the presence of a high - quality transmission resonance , with a dramatic sensitivity of the resonance linewidth to the number of asrs in the sample .",
    "@xcite the transmission resonance was also observed to depend strongly on the spatial distribution of the mutually interacting resonators . where a sufficiently large , regular array of asrs exhibits a high quality transmission resonance,@xcite introducing disorder in the elements positions destroys the observed spectral transmission window,@xcite further indicating the role collective em interactions can play in metamaterial dynamics .",
    "we recently showed @xcite that closely spaced asr metamolecules interacting via a resonant em field exhibit collective eigenmodes with strongly suppressed resonance linewidths .",
    "the cooperative response yields the characteristic feature in the experimentally observed enhanced quality factor of the transmission resonance in ref .  .",
    "numerically analyzing the properties of collective modes with narrow radiative resonance linewidths provided a physical explanation of this phenomenon with an excellent agreement between the simulations and the measurements .    in our previous study@xcite showing how the transmission resonance observed by fedotov _ _ et al__@xcite depends on the linewidth of a particular collective mode , all unit - cell resonators were assumed to respond to em fields identically . in the preparation of metamaterial samples , fabrication defects ,",
    "however , may in general lead to variation in the geometry of individual resonators .",
    "the current oscillations supported by the unit - cell resonators would therefore possess slightly different resonance frequencies , resulting in inhomogeneously broadened metamaterial arrays .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening changes the conditions of the resonant interaction processes .",
    "this may impair the collective , coherent phenomena which are potentially important in several applications and physical effects of metamaterials such as lasing @xcite and providing precise control and manipulation of em fields on a sub - wavelength scale , as theoretically proposed in ref .   and",
    "experimentally observed in ref .",
    "( for other related studies , see for example ref .  ) .    in this work ,",
    "we study how uncontrolled inhomogeneous broadening of plasmonic resonators limits the observation of collective phenomena in metamaterials .",
    "we will examine under what conditions these collective effects can still persist and potential implications of inhomogeneous broadening on metamaterial applications . in particular , we consider a rectangular 2d array of asr meta - molecules whose resonance frequencies are stochastically varied .",
    "we numerically evaluate ensemble averages of the em response of the metamaterial over the stochastic distributions of the resonator properties .",
    "these show how increased inhomogeneous broadening inhibits the response of the coherent collective modes responsible for the transmission resonance observed in ref .  .",
    "moreover , we find the effects of interactions between different discrete resonator elements , which result in the narrowing of the radiative resonance linewidth , are diminished as a function of an increasing inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "our results therefore illustrate how maintaining uniformity in the fabrication process is essential in designing new metamaterial based devices whose applications rely on strong interactions between the resonator elements and on a cooperative response .",
    "the multiple scale spatial structure associated with nano - fabricated resonators in metamaterial arrays , along with the wave nature of scattered em fields , poses a theoretical challenge for studies of the response of these systems to resonant em fields .",
    "interactions resulting from recurrent scattering events , in which a field is scattered more than once by the same resonator , frequently play a crucial role in the cooperative system responses .",
    "@xcite while in an infinite , regular lattice , the translational symmetry can be exploited to calculate approximate local field corrections in a medium of discrete scatterers @xcite , recurrent scattering processes are generally more difficult to model in finite - sized systems with complex geometries .    however , since inhomogeneous broadening reduces the cooperative effects arising from recurrent scattering , engineering a controlled amount of inhomogeneous broadening into the metamaterial , e.g. via geometrical variation of the resonators , may provide a practical means to produce samples that are easier to design and theoretically analyze . in particular , we find that with an increasing inhomogeneous broadening the response of the system approaches that of standard continuous medium electrodynamics . reducing cooperative effects is potentially important because several metamaterial applications , such as diffraction - free lenses formed from a medium with a negative refractive index,@xcite are simplest to realize with a well - defined electric susceptibility and magnetic permeability that , in many systems with complex geometries , are only approximately achieved.@xcite    the effects of inhomogeneous broadening have previously been examined , e.g. , by gorkunov _",
    "et al _ on the bulk properties of left - handed materials in periodic infinite lattices,@xcite and have been experimentally observed by gollub _",
    "et al_.@xcite in our study of asr resonators we evaluate collective modes of a finite lattice in order to investigate the effects of the inhomogeneous broadening on the experimentally observed sample size dependent transmission resonant linewidth narrowing .",
    "@xcite    in our analysis we employ a general theoretical formalism of collective interactions between a discrete set of plasmonic resonators , or meta - atoms , mediated by the em field that we developed in ref .  .",
    "in the model , we assume each meta - atom exhibits a single mode of current oscillation that possesses appropriate electric and magnetic dipole moments",
    ". each meta - atom responds to em fields exhibiting a specific resonance frequency and coupling strength that are determined by its characteristic design .",
    "starting from the lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism describing the interaction of the em field with polarization and magnetization densities created by a charge distribution , we then derived the coupled dynamics of the em fields and the meta - atom dynamic variables.@xcite in a collection of meta - atoms , interactions with the em field mediate a dynamic coupling between the meta - atoms and determine the collective dynamics within the ensemble , resulting in distinct collective modes with corresponding resonance frequencies and linewidths .",
    "the analysis of collective response in terms of discrete resonators also points to the direction of an interesting analogy between resonators and a system of a cloud of atoms . in atoms the electron transitions driven by an em field create an electric dipole moment , while in the case of circuit elements the oscillating current generates both the electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the model of ref .   has previously been successful in providing an excellent agreement between the theory and experimental observations of cooperative transmission resonance linewidth narrowing of asr metamolecules.@xcite    the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",

    "we assume the meta - atoms are designed such that the electric quadrupole and higher order multipole contributions to the meta - atom dynamics can be ignored .",
    "although each meta - atom possesses only electric and magnetic dipoles , a meta - molecule of two or more meta - atoms in our model would exhibit a non - vanishing quadrupole field . while , in general , this quadrupole contribution is inaccurately represented in the dipole approximation , in the case of the asr meta - molecules considered in refs .   and in the present study",

    "this has been indicated by finite element simulations of maxwell s equations within a single meta - molecule.@xcite additionally , the fact that the size of the meta - atoms is often comparable to the spacing between them could result in a correction to the coupling strength between neighboring elements obtained in the point dipole approximation .",

    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the collective modes of a finite - sized 2d metamaterial array of asr resonators and how they are influenced by an inhomogeneous broadening of the resonance frequencies of the individual resonators .",
    "the study was motivated by recent experimental observations of transmission resonance linewidth narrowing as a function of the size of the system.@xcite this effect can be understood by analyzing the resonance linewidths of collective modes of the system that undergo dramatic narrowing due to strong em field mediated interactions between the resonators . as demonstrated by previous comparisons between the numerical simulation results and the experimental observations,@xcite the response can be analyzed by a simplified model in which each meta - atom is treated as a discrete element supporting a single mode of current oscillation possessing electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "collective interactions between the meta - atoms are mediated by the scattered em fields .",
    "the excellent agreement between the theory and the experiment can be understood by a relatively weak higher - order multiple radiation of individual asr metamolecules.@xcite    we examined in detail how inhomogeneous broadening of resonator resonance frequencies impairs the coherent collective phenomena that are expected to find important applications in metamaterial systems.@xcite while the transmission resonance experimentally observed in ref .   persists for inhomogeneous broadening that is a fraction of the asr asymmetry parameter @xmath178 ,",
    "the cooperative response vanishes when the broadening begins to exceed that parameter .",
    "production of high quality resonances with low loss materials requires the reduction of @xmath178.@xcite figure  [ fig : modeoverlap ] indicates that , in order to produce such high quality resonances , the uniformity in the production of meta - molecules will need to become correspondingly small .",
