    "emission line stars ( els ) range from young to evolved stars ( ttauri , herbig ae / be , wr , planetary nebulae , etc ) , from hot to cool stars ( classical be star , oe , supergiant star , mira ceti , flare stars , etc ) . among the els , here ,",
    "we focus on the classical be stars .",
    "they are non - supergiant b type stars , which have displayed at least once emission lines in their spectra , mainly in the balmer series of the hydrogen .",
    "the emission lines come from a circumstellar decretion disk formed by episodic matter ejection of the central star .",
    "it appears that the be phenomenon is related to fast rotation and probably additional properties such as non - radial pulsation or magnetic fields . for a comprehensive review of",
    "be stars in the milky way we refer the reader to * ? ? ?",
    "it seems also that the low metallicity plays a role @xcite : at low metallicity , typical of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , the stellar radiatively driven winds are less efficient than at high metallicity ( typical of the milky way [ mw ] ) , thus the mass loss is lower and the stars keep more angular momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "b - type stars rotate faster in the smc / lmc than in the mw @xcite .",
    "it is then expected that the metallicity has also an effect on the be - phenomenon itself as reported by * ? ? ? * or * ? ? ?",
    "* , while the evolutionary phase could also play a role @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the study of open clusters was done by using photometric observations , in the mw .",

    "this paper deals with our slitless spectroscopic survey of els and oe / be / ae stars in smc open clusters , while in the whole smc 3 million spectra were obtained .",
    "to increase the number of open clusters studied in the smc ( 1 to 6 in the previous photometric studies of * ? ? ?",
    "* or * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to improve the statistics , and to quantify the evolution of the rates of be stars to b stars with decreasing metallicity , we performed a slitless spectroscopic survey of the smc .",
    "the observations were obtained on september 25 , 2002 with the eso wide field imager ( wfi , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the 2.2 m mpg telescope located at la silla in chile .",
    "we used its slitless spectroscopic mode with the r50 grism and a narrow filter centered on h@xmath0 to reduce the crowding of observed areas .",
    "we recall that this kind of instrumentation is not sensitive to the diffuse ambient nebulosities and does not allow weak emission lines to be found . with 10-minutes exposures with wfi , it is possible to detect emission lines with ew@xmath110   or with a relative intensity to the continuum equal to 2 down to v magnitudes around 17.5 . for fainter stars , due to the noise in the spectra , it is only stronger emission lines are within reach . as an example of this kind of observations ,",

    "* , in order to obtain the b , v , i magnitudes of the stars , the reddening , and the age of open clusters . with this information , the absolute magnitudes and the derreddened colour indices of the stars were derived .",
    "several open clusters are found with high ratios of be to b stars , occasionally even higher than in ngc330 , an open cluster already known for its rich be content . in order to abstract from the large variations from one open cluster to another in their frequency of",

    "we classified the 4300 stars in our sample by using the calibration provided by * ? ? ? * .",

    "thus , there is an impact of the metallicity on the number of be stars probably corresponding to the increase of the rotational velocities in the smc in comparison with the mw .",

    "there is also another peak at b5-b6 , which can be seen in the mw studies ( complete for the whole b - main sequence ) .",
    "the first peak corresponds to the maximum of the emission intensity , the second one to the combined effects of the decrease of the emission intensity and the increase of the initial mass function of stars towards late type stars .",
    "+ from preliminary results it appears that predominantly young open clusters + ( age@xmath2100myears ) are found to contain classical be ( cbe ) stars , but depending on the types of the stars , certain cbe stars could have reached the terminal - age main sequence ( tams ) .",
    "for example in the case of b0e stars , the tams is reached in @xmath310 myears . some other old open clusters ( age@xmath4100myears ) host cbe stars . from these results",

    "thanks to different codes and ogle data , we were able to find and classify the emission line stars and absorption stars ( @xmath34300 stars ) .",
    "the ratios of be stars to b stars in the smc and mw were studied .",
    "the comparison allows to quantify the increase of the number of be stars with decreasing metallicity .",
    "be stars in the smc are 2 to 4 times more abundant than in the mw depending on the spectral types .",
    "it seems also that early be stars follow the same distribution in the smc and mw with a maximum at the spectral type b2 . about the stellar phases at which be stars",
    "appear , from our preliminary results , it seems that certain be stars could be born as be stars , while others could appear during the main sequence depending also probably on the metallicity and spectral types of stars .",
