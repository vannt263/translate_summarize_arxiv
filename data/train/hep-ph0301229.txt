    "some of the relevant intrinsic properties of the phase transition are best investigated using the order parameter of the theory .",
    "sometimes the order parameter can be a non physical object or not experimentally accessible .",
    "the pure yang - mills deconfinement phase transition constitutes a time honored example . here",
    "the order parameter is the polyakov loop which is not a physical state of the theory while the physical field is the glueball field .",
    "we argue that it is always possible to extract all of the relevant information about a specific phase transition using a non order parameter field which is a physical state of the underlying theory .",
    "we predict the universal behavior of this field near and at the phase transition .",
    "more specifically we predict a finite drop in the mass of the singlet field at the phase transition .",
    "our predictions seem to reproduce surprisingly well the general features of some lattice data and can be put to further and more stringent tests via new first principle lattice simulations .",
    "finally , we define new physical quantities able to characterize the phase transition .",
    "we consider a temperature regime close to the phase transition . in order for our results to be as universal as possible we study a renormalizable lagrangian containing a field neutral under the global symmetries and the order parameter field of theory as well as their interactions .",
    "the protagonists of our theory are two canonically normalized fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the field @xmath0 is a scalar of @xmath2 while @xmath1 transforms according to @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "here we consider the case @xmath5 .",
    "this theory is suitable for understanding the deconfining phase transition of 2 color yang - mills which has been heavily studied via lattice simulations .",
    "a general , renormalizable , potential is : @xmath6 the coefficients are all real with @xmath7 .",
    "stability requires @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this potential to @xmath2 . since we will relate @xmath1 to the polyakov loop , we take it to depend only on space coordinates .",
    "this leads to a mixed situation in which the physical states depend also on time .",
    "we will also briefly comment on what happens when the order parameter is taken to be four dimensional .",
    "the lagrangian we use to define our feynman rules is : @xmath10 we start our investigation at temperatures below @xmath11 . since the phase transition is of second order , @xmath12 vanishes at the transition point .",
    "all of the coupling constants are such that @xmath0 and @xmath1 have zero vacuum expectation value in this regime .",
    "we focus our attention on the @xmath0 self energy at the one loop level at a given non zero temperature :    fmftempl @xmath13 the double lines indicate @xmath1 fields while single lines stand for @xmath0 ones .",
    "we are not considering tadpole diagrams which we require to vanish at each given loop order by adding a counterterm linear in @xmath0 .",
    "the number in front of each diagram is the associated combinatorial factor .",
    "we consider the limit in which the @xmath0 mass is much larger than the temperatures in play , hence all of the loops containing only @xmath0 fields are then infrared finite at any temperature .",
    "the second diagram in eq .",
    "( [ selfh ] ) is , however , linearly ultraviolet divergent but this divergence is absorbed in the respective mass counterterm .",
    "after all the ultraviolet divergences have been taken into account , we can show that the finite temperature corrections due to @xmath0 are boltzman suppressed .",
    "we are left with the following infrared divergent graph for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and this diagram constitutes the relevant one loop correction to the @xmath0 mass which reads : @xmath16 this is the way the nearby phase transition is directly felt by the non order parameter field .",
    "it shows that the mass of the singlet field must decrease fast close to the phase transition .",
    "an unpleasant consequence is that this one loop result breaks down at the transition point due to the infrared singularity .    besides",
    ", since @xmath0 is not the order parameter , its correlation length ( i.e. @xmath17 ) is not expected to diverge at the phase transition . to cure the infrared behavior we need to go beyond the one - loop approximation and consistently resum the following set of diagrams : @xmath18",
    "each diagram is infrared divergent but when resummed @xmath19 is finite at @xmath20 and reads : @xmath21 at @xmath22 we have @xmath23 hence we predict that close to the phase transition the singlet state has a decreasing mass .",
    "the drop at the phase transition point is the ratio between the square of the coupling constant governing the interaction of the singlet state with the order parameter ( @xmath24 ) and the order parameter self interaction coupling constant ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the slope is : @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "this slope encodes the critical behavior of the theory even though it is constructed using the non order parameter field .",
    "for example if @xmath28 vanishes as @xmath29 close to the phase transition , then @xmath30 scales with the exponent @xmath31 .",
    "when considering an @xmath32 symmetry group rather than @xmath33 the resummation procedure becomes exact in the large @xmath34 limit @xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 @xmath1 develops a vacuum expectation value which will induce one also for @xmath0 : @xmath36 where we denoted the mass of @xmath1 in the broken phase by @xmath37 and considered small @xmath0 fluctuations ( i.e. we kept only the @xmath24 interaction term for @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results found in @xcite .",
    "the fields @xmath1 and @xmath0 mix in this phase and the mixing angle @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath39 . the mixing can be neglected within the present approximations .",
    "like for @xmath40 , we consider also now only the effects due to @xmath1 loops for the @xmath0 propagator . due to symmetry",
    "breaking we now have the trilinear @xmath1 couplings : @xmath41 which substantially affect the analysis and the results in this phase .",
    "at the one loop level the diagram to compute is again the one in eq .",
    "( [ one - loop ] ) with @xmath12 replaced by @xmath42 .",
    "so we predict a drop on the right hand side of @xmath11 while this diagram is clearly infrared divergent . curing the divergence now is more involved due to the appearance of the trilinear @xmath1 coupling .",
    "a typical diagram in the consistent set of diagrams we consider is of the form : @xmath43 }      \\fmfiset{p1}{vpath1(__v7,__v8 ) }      \\fmfiset{p2}{vpath2(__v8,__v7 ) }      \\fmfiset{p3}{vpath1(__a3,__v9 ) }      \\fmfiset{p4}{vpath2(__v9,__a3 ) }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( 0,length(p1)/2 ) of p1 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( length(p1)/2,length(p1))of p1 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( 0,length(p2)/2 ) of p2 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( length(p2)/2,length(p2 ) ) of p2 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{point length(p1)/2 of p1 -- point length(p2)/2 of p2 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( 0,length(p3)/2 ) of p3 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( length(p3)/2,length(p3))of p3 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( 0,length(p4)/2 ) of p4 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{subpath ( length(p4)/2,length(p4 ) ) of p4 }      \\fmfi{dbl_plain}{point length(p3)/2 of p3 -- point length(p4)/2 of p4 } \\end{fmfgraph}}\\ ] ]    we choose this subset of diagrams since the associate infinite sum can be performed exactly @xcite and it has knowledge of the onset of chiral symmetry breaking via the trilinear vertices . @xmath44",
    "the infrared divergence has been cured for @xmath45 .",
    "we also see that @xmath46 from the right hand side of the transition equals exactly the one from the unbroken side of the transition",
    ". this remarkable result does not hold order by order in the loop expansion but only when an infinite sum of the diagrams is performed .",
    "the @xmath0 mass square is a continuous function throughout the phase transition and the associated correlation length remains finite .",
    "however the slope of the @xmath0 mass near the phase transition from the right hand side does not mirror the one on the left .",
    "this fact is due to the onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking communicated to @xmath0 via the trilinear @xmath1 interaction term . indeed : @xmath47 and we deduce the relation : @xmath48 the @xmath0 mass drops on the left hand side of the phase transition and rises on the right one .",
    "the slope on the right side ( broken phase ) is less singular with respect to the one on the left .",
    "more specifically the scaling exponent for @xmath49 is @xmath50 .",
    "deviations from such a behavior directly measure departures from the second order character of the phase transition . in the figure",
    "we schematically represent the behavior of the @xmath0 mass as a function of the temperature in units of the critical temperature for @xmath51 .",
    "the similarity of our result with the lattice data @xcite ( right panel of fig.[figura1 ] ) is surprising .",
    "recall , though , that our results are directly applicable to the two color yang - mills theory , while the data in @xcite are obtained for the three color yang - mills theory .",
    "this resemblance is in agreement with the almost second order character of the three color deconfining phase transition .",
    "another difference is that the mass in @xcite seems to be the screening one while we are plotting here the physical mass .",
    "it is of common practice to isolate the order parameter and more generally the light degrees of freedom since they are expected to be the relevant degrees at low energies . while this is certainly correct we have explicitly shown how all of the essential features of the phase transition are encoded in the non order parameter fields of the theory as well .",
    "our analysis is useful whenever the order parameter is neither a physical quantity nor phenomenologically accessible ( e.g. the polyakov loop ) .",
    "we also studied what happens if the order parameter depends on the time coordinate .",
    "the @xmath0 mass has the same behavior near the transition as in the previous case .",
    "this can be easily understood since the infrared physics is dominated by the zero mode of @xmath1 .",
    "the major difference with the previous analysis is that a physical width develops describing the decay of @xmath0 into two @xmath1 fields at non zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 deconfinement phase transition is a hard problem .",
    "importance sampling lattice simulations provide crucial information about the nature of the temperature driven phase transition for 2 and 3 colors yang - mills theories with and without matter fields ( see @xcite for 3 colors ) .",
    "different approaches @xcite are used in literature to tackle the features of this phase transition . at zero temperature",
    "@xmath52 yang - mills theory is asymptotically free and the physical spectrum of the theory consists of a tower of hadronic states referred to as glueballs and pseudo - scalar glueballs .",
    "the theory develops a mass gap and the lightest glueball has a mass of the order of few times the confining scale .    at nonzero temperature",
    "the @xmath2 center of @xmath52 is a relevant global symmetry @xcite , and it is possible to construct a number of gauge invariant operators charged under @xmath2 among which the most notable one is the polyakov loop : @xmath53\\equiv\\frac{1}{n}{\\rm tr } \\left[{\\cal p}\\exp\\left[i\\,g\\int_{0}^{1/t}a_{0}(x,\\tau)d\\tau\\right]\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath54 denotes path ordering , @xmath55 is the @xmath52 coupling constant and @xmath56 is the coordinate for the three spatial dimensions while @xmath57 is the euclidean time .",
    "the @xmath58 field is real for @xmath5 while otherwise complex .",
    "this object is charged with respect to the center @xmath2 of the @xmath52 gauge group @xcite under which it transforms as @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "a relevant feature of the polyakov loop is that its expectation value vanishes in the low temperature regime while is non zero in the high temperature phase .",
    "the polyakov loop is a suitable order parameter for the yang - mills temperature driven phase transition @xcite .",
    "pisarski used this feature @xcite to model the yang - mills phase transition via a mean field theory of polyakov loops .",
    "the model is referred to as the polyakov loop model ( plm ) .",
    "recently some interesting phenomenological plm inspired models aimed to understand rhic physics were constructed .",
    "here we consider pure gluon dynamics .",
    "this allows us to have a well defined framework where the @xmath2 symmetry is exact .",
    "the hadronic states of the yang - mills theory are the glueballs . at zero temperature",
    "the yang - mills trace anomaly has been used to constrain the potential of the lightest glueball state @xmath61 @xcite : @xmath62=\\frac{h}{2 } \\ln \\left[\\frac{h}{\\lambda^4}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath63 is chosen to be the confining scale of the theory and @xmath61 is a mass dimension four field .",
    "this potential correctly saturates the trace anomaly when @xmath61 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 is the standard yang - mills field strength .    in @xcite",
    "a concrete model was proposed able to transfer the information about the yang - mills phase transition encoded in the @xmath2 global symmetry to the hadronic states of the theory .",
    "this model is constructed using trace anomaly and the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the model in @xcite is supported by recent theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "once the relation between the fields @xmath61 and @xmath0 , and @xmath58 and @xmath1 is made the relations between the couplings of the lagrangian for @xmath61 and @xmath58 constructed in @xcite and the renormalizable one presented here can be obtained . more specifically , our renormalizable theory is a truncated ( up to fourth order in the fields ) version of the full glueball theory .",
    "for example one can take the following relation between @xmath61 and the glueball field @xmath0 : @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the vacuum expectation value of the glueball field below the critical temperature and @xmath68 is a positive dimensionless constant fixed by the mass of the glueball . for the @xmath58 field we have @xmath69 with @xmath70",
    "a mass dimension two constant ( at high temperature is proportional to @xmath71 ) .",
    "our present results are simply the higher loop corrections to the glueball model presented in @xcite and can be immediately applied to the two color yang - mills phase transition .",
    "we confronted already our theoretical results with lattice computations of the glueball mass behavior close to the phase transition studied in @xcite for three colors .",
    "our analysis not only is in agreement with the numerical analysis but allows us to provide a better understanding of the physics in play .",
    "more recent lattice results should provide a still more detailed test of our predictions .    finally , using a renormalizable theory containing a singlet heavy field uncharged under a global symmetry and the associated order parameter with their possible interactions we demonstrated that the information about the phase transition can be extracted via the singlet field .",
    "the transfer of information from the order parameter to the heavy field is in fact complete .",
    "moreover , if we consider the large @xmath34 limit for the @xmath32 theory the analysis in the unbroken phase becomes exact .",
    "thanks to the result established here and envisioned in @xcite we can use directly the knowledge about @xmath0 , or more specifically of some of its properties defined in the text , to characterize the phase transition . we considered a @xmath33 symmetry group appropriate for example to discuss the deconfining phase transition for 2 color yang - mills theory .",
    "the generalization to a general group of symmetries is straightforward .",
