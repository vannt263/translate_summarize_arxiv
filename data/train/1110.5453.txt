    "the recent announcement of the opera result @xcite indicating possible superluminal propagation of neutrinos has excited considerable interest . various aspects of the experiment ,",
    "the analysis of the data and their interpretation , must be subjected to a thorough examination since the result has important repercussions on fundamental physics .",
    "furthermore , independent confirmation or refutation by other experiments is absolutely essential .",
    "if the result stands , one must first see whether it can be understood within the usual framework of physics before giving up cherished notions such as lorentz invariance .",
    "in fact , this is possible , in principle , as was shown by mecozzi and bellini @xcite . by considering the interference between the different mass eigenstates of the neutrinos they showed that superluminal propagation is possible .",
    "we extend their analysis by explicitly including the effect of the finite width of wave packets and provide a numerical estimate of the effect for realistic neutrino parameters with three generation mixing and matter effects taken into account .",
    "our numbers indicate that there is a very narrow region in the allowed parameter space with three neutrino flavour mixing in which superluminal propagation is possible in principle .",
    "however , the survival probability for neutrinos with superluminal velocities is almost vanishing rendering them unobservable in practice . furthermore , this depends crucially on the ratio of the distance of propagation and the energy of the neutrinos . at distances and energies corresponding to the opera experiment ,",
    "superluminal propagation is not possible with the present limits imposed by the neutrino parameter space .",
    "if the opera result is confirmed it would require new physics .",
    "therefore , we would like to stress the importance of further studies along the present lines since the opera experiment has opened up a new window on neutrino physics , which may be called neutrino optics and which should be pursued by future experiments .    in sec .",
    "ii we outline the group velocity calculation in the wave packet formalism . in the context of neutrino oscillation , this formalism has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "we derive results for short and very long base - line propagation of neutrinos , based on which we present a realistic numerical analysis in the framework of 3 neutrino mixing in sec .",
    "other issues related to group velocity measurements will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv while sec .",
    "v concludes the paper with some remarks on the implications of opera - type experiments in future .",
    "the neutrino flavour states @xmath0 are related to mass eigenstates @xmath1 by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a unitary matrix . for a neutrino that starts as a flavour state @xmath4 at @xmath5 ,",
    "the state vector at time @xmath6 is @xmath7 where we have superposed the three energy eigenstates with the same momentum p and then superposed different @xmath8 with an amplitude of gaussian form @xmath9 to form a wave packet .",
    "we have set @xmath10 .",
    "the normalisation constant is determined by the condition @xmath11 .    the probability amplitude for detecting @xmath12 at time @xmath6 is @xmath13 where we have used @xmath14 we expand the energy @xmath15 around the peak @xmath16 of the gaussian and keep upto the quadratic terms ( assuming the width of the wave packet in momentum space to be small enough ) : @xmath17 with this approximation , the @xmath8-integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) can be done to yield the result ( absorbing the constant factors into @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "thus we have a superposition of 3 gaussians in @xmath21-space with their centres travelling with 3 separate group velocities , @xmath22 however , if the @xmath21-space gaussians are broad , that is , if @xmath23 is small , then these 3 gaussians will interfere . to study this ,",
    "let us define @xmath24 the integrations are straightforward and the result is @xmath25 where @xmath26 defining the overall - group velocity of neutrinos generated as @xmath27 at time @xmath5 and detected as @xmath28 at time @xmath6 as @xmath29 as was done by mecozzi and bellini @xcite , we get @xmath30 this is the main result of the paper .",
    "we now consider the special case of two generation mixing with @xmath31 as the two neutrino flavours .",
    "substituting @xmath32 , and denoting @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 let us consider the two extreme limits from the above equation .",
    "first consider the case when the width @xmath35 of the wave packets in the @xmath21-space is large compared to the distance of separation between the two centres of the wave packets , that is @xmath36 . in this limit",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) becomes @xmath37~. \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this agrees with the result of mecozzi and bellini@xcite .",
    "however as the distance or time of propagation increases , the width of the wave packets in @xmath21-space becomes small compared to the distance of separation between the two centres of the wave packets , @xmath38 , and we get @xmath39~ , \\label{eq : gaussdamp}\\ ] ] which is the weighted average of the group velocities of the two wave packets .",
    "interestingly , the effect of the gaussian suppression is precisely the same as taking the average over energy and distance in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "this makes sense since , for instance , at astrophysical distances , the neutrino wave - length is small compared to the distance of propagation .",
    "thus the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) generalises the result of mecozzi and bellini to wave packets of finite width . because of the approximation made in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , for large @xmath23 the damping factor @xmath40 is only approximate , although its exact replacement also will damp the oscillatory factor @xmath41 .",
    "if the calculations are done for waves of infinite spatial extent , the integrals occurring in the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) would be individually divergent , although the final result would turn out to be finite . however , it is better to do these calculations with wave packets of finite width @xmath23 , as has been done above , and take the limit of @xmath42 in the end .",
    "we have superposed the 3 mass eigenstates with the same momentum @xmath8 but different @xmath43 to form the neutrino state vector in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "should one superpose different @xmath44 but the same @xmath15 , or , different @xmath44 and different @xmath43 ?",
    "this question has been studied in recent literature @xcite . such possibilities will be included in a future study of the group velocities of neutrino waves , which is under preparation .    for neutrinos",
    "whose energy is very large compared to their rest masses , the formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) may be written in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the measured mass - squared difference and base - line distance and @xmath49 the width of the @xmath8-space wave packet .",
    "thus the exponential damping factor multiplying the oscillatory factor @xmath50 is simply @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fractional uncertainty in momentum .",
    "we also note that the formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) for two- and three- generations are valid , to the leading order , for propagation through matter at constant density when vacuum values of @xmath43 and the mixing angles are replaced by their matter - dependent values .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , the normalised oscillation probability , that is , the probability for detecting flavour @xmath53 at time @xmath6 is @xmath54 this differs from the usual oscillation formula by the factor @xmath55 in the second term . in view of the successful neutrino oscillation phenomenology",
    "achived so far , we will assume that @xmath56 is so small that this factor can be replaced by unity for all the terrestrial experiments as well as solar neutrino experiments .    since the oscillation probability given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probb ] ) is the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , the group velocity can become very large if the oscillation probability is very small .",
    "in fact , it can become infinite if the oscillation probability at that distance is zero .",
    "this is the origin of superluminal propagation , as our analysis in the next section will clearly show .",
    "we now come back to the interpretation of @xmath57 defined in eq.([eq6 ] ) which is the basis of the above formulae .",
    "note that in the denominator we have @xmath58 instead of @xmath59 which is unity .",
    "thus @xmath60 must be interpreted as the _ conditional measurement _ of the position of the neutrino under the condition that only @xmath27 is detected . here the probability amplitude for detecting it as @xmath27 itself is regarded as the wave function for normalising the expectation value of @xmath21 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the usual definition of the expectation value of @xmath21 , independent of the flavour detected , namely @xmath61 we may distinguish this case by calling it the _ unconditional measurement _ of the expectation value of @xmath21 .",
    "before we go to the numerical analysis , we make some general remarks . as already pointed out , the origin of the superluminal propagation is the vanishing of the oscillation probability @xmath62 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "superluminal propagation and the vanishing of the oscillation probability go together .",
    "since the number of events also vanishes , one has the paradoxical situation of _ unobservable superluminal propagation_. our numerical analysis below is subject to this criticism .    in the particular case of the opera experiment , @xmath62 becomes the survival probability @xmath63 .",
    "there is no evidence for the survival probability @xmath63 in opera becoming vanishingly small .",
    "hence explanation of superluminality through enhancement of the group velocity in the standard oscillation frame - work as discussed above is untenable .",
    "our numerical analysis will be based on the group velocity derived from the conditional measurement of @xmath64 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) , following mecozzi and bellini  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could base the analysis on the group velocity derived from the unconditional measurement @xmath65 defined in eq .",
    "( [ uncond ] ) .",
    "since this does not have the vanishing denominator , it will not lead to superluminal group velocity .",
    "actually , for the opera experiement , both @xmath66 and @xmath67 will give essentially the same result for the group velocity since @xmath63 at opera does not deviate very much from unity , as far as is known .",
    "to obtain a realistic estimate for the group velocity of muon neutrinos , and its implications , we discuss the three generation scenario .    as shown in the previous section , the gaussian smearing will have no effect if @xmath68 .",
    "we will work under this assumption and make estimates for this quantity later , showing that it is indeed small . as a first approximation we neglect the matter effects .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , we may write the  group velocity \" of the superposition that starts as @xmath69 and is detected as @xmath69 ( which we denote as @xmath70 for simplicity ) as @xmath71 the factors @xmath72 are given as @xmath73~ ; \\label{eq : s12}\\ ] ] @xmath74~ , \\label{eq : s32}\\ ] ] where the denominator , which is simply the survival probability of @xmath69 , is given by , @xmath75 here @xmath76 where @xmath77 and the mixing parameters are given in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal as @xmath78 , \\label{eq : u}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the cp phase .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 correspond to the second row of the mixing matrix .",
    "note that in the absence of any mixing @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vmu ] ) reduces to @xmath82 , as it should .",
    "we now present a numerical analysis of the possible values of @xmath70 with realistic parameter values for the mixing angles and mass squared differences .",
    "we use typical values / ranges for the mass - squared differences and neutrino mixing parameters : @xmath83 ev@xmath84 , @xmath85 ev@xmath84 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 while @xmath89 is unknown @xcite .",
    "the sign of @xmath90 is not known and there are two possible hierarchies , @xmath91 known as normal hierarchy ( n ) and @xmath92 known as inverted hierarchy ( i ) .",
    "we consider results for both these cases .",
    "note that the propagation can become superluminal when the @xmath72 are significantly enhanced over unity .",
    "[ fig : sij ] shows the values of @xmath93 , close to maximal mixing , where this enhancement is seen , for different mass hierarchies as well as values of @xmath94 .",
    "( notice therefore that this measurement is sensitive to the mass ordering in the 23 sector which is as yet unknown ) .",
    "this enhancement of the group velocity occurs for @xmath95 , well within the range of the opera experiment , viz .",
    ", @xmath96 .",
    "however , it can be seen from the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sij ] that @xmath63 is very close to zero precisely at these values , that is , the enhancement of @xmath72 is dominantly due to the vanishing of the denominator .",
    "( the maxima of @xmath72 are slightly offset from the minima of @xmath63 because of the dependence of the numerator on the mixing parameters as well .",
    "in fact , when @xmath97 , @xmath63 and @xmath72 both vanish near @xmath98 . )",

    "the dips as @xmath107 correspond to the sharp peaks in @xmath72 on the left.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    several remarks are in order :    * the first is that the mixing parameters as well as @xmath108 need to be extremely fine - tuned in order to get this effect .",
    "however they are almost washed out by the suppression of the event rate due to small survival probability .",
    "* the extreme enhancement of @xmath72 over unity is required in order to obtain superluminal velocities commensurate with the opera observation .",
    "this is because the coefficients of @xmath72 which are @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vmu ] ) behave as @xmath110 and are small due to the highly suppressing factor of @xmath111 in the denominator .",
    "it is unlikely that such small excesses will be measurable by any experiment .",
    "the larger the enhancement required , the more finely tuned are the parameters .",
    "* moreover , the fine - tuning in the value of @xmath108 would imply that the enhancement of the velocity only occurs for a single @xmath15 value when the base - line distance @xmath48 is kept fixed , in contrast to the observed roughly constant enhancement over a range of @xmath112 gev as observed in opera @xcite . + one way of working around this limitation is to consider the energy dependence of the matter - dependent contributions .",
    "the usual electro - weak interactions in matter lead to the inclusion of a matter - dependent potential , @xmath113 , that alters the matter dependent mass - squared differences in a non - trivial way ; however , the resulting change is not large enough to give the required enhancement of the factor of 14 in the term @xmath114 at @xmath115 gev .",
    "+ one possible solution is the inclusion of a new matter interaction @xmath116 with the same energy behaviour , but about an order of magnitude larger than the usual electro - weak potential .",
    "then , at energies around @xmath115 gev relevant to the opera data , the expression for the matter - dependent mass - squared differences simplifies to @xmath117 so that the term occurring in @xmath118 becomes @xmath119 the energy dependence of this matter potential is exactly what is required so that the ratio @xmath120 is approximately independent of @xmath15 for @xmath121s of gev ( but does not significantly alter the atmospheric neutrino analysis ) . such an energy - independent contribution would remove the fine - tuning in @xmath108 that currently occurs in the expressions for @xmath118 and would in principle uniformly allow for superluminal propagation of all velocities relevant to the opera analysis .",
    "however , while resolving the fine - tuning in @xmath108 , the new matter potential enhances the relevant terms in a manner identical to the vacuum analysis , viz .",
    ", through the vanishing of @xmath63 .",
    "hence , it runs into the same difficulties with observing the effect as discussed earlier . * in spite of what is said above , superluminal group velocity is a real effect and may be observable in future , as shown in the following example . consider the 2-flavour case where we neglect @xmath122 and set @xmath123 ev@xmath84 . for smaller energies of the order of kevs , observable excesses of @xmath70 over unity can be obtained for a modest value of @xmath124 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath125 , with the ratio @xmath108 tuned so that @xmath126 ( achievable with energies in kev and length in meters ) ; this leads to @xmath127 . for energy @xmath15 in kev",
    "we get an enhancement @xmath128 ; it may thus be possible to observe the effect since @xmath63 is not zero .",
    "of course , there are many experimental problems to be overcome before such an observation is achieved .",
    "we add a few remarks on the implication of the opera result independent of the fact that it is superluminal or subluminal .",
    "consider a possible measurement of group velocities of electron and muon neutrinos in a future possible experiment .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ eq : vmu ] ) , these velocities in vacuum may be written in the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s12 ] ) and ( [ eq : s32 ] ) and @xmath131 are given by @xmath132 } { 1 - 4\\sum_{j > i=1}^3|u_{e i}|^2 |u_{e j}|^2 \\sin^2(\\delta e_{ij}t/2)}~ , \\label{eq18}\\ ] ] and @xmath133 } { 1 - 4\\sum_{j > i=1}^3|u_{e i}|^2 |u_{e j}|^2 \\sin^2(\\delta e_{ij}t/2)}~. \\label{eq19}\\ ] ] simultaneous measurement of these two velocities immediately gives information on the ordering of masses @xmath122 and @xmath134 since we already know that @xmath135 from the solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "unlike earlier proposed solutions @xcite , this does not require matter effects to resolve the issue .",
    "even a short base - line experiment with neutrino factories with muon storage rings may help resolve the hierarchy issue .",
    "note that the @xmath136 and @xmath70 could refer to either neutrinos or antineutrinos .",
    "the caveat is that the effect is magnified only for a given set of parameter values including @xmath108 .",
    "to summarise , we have considered the superposition of 3 energy ( mass ) eigenstates with the same momentum @xmath8 , but with different energies @xmath43 to form a neutrino flavour state .",
    "we have included the effect of the finite width of wave packets of the same width and considered its effect on the group velocity of the neutrino flavour state .    when this is applied to the propagation of @xmath69 for distances of the order of hundreds of kms and energies corresponding to the observation of muon neutrinos in the opera experiment we find the effect is very small .",
    "effectively the finite width can be ignored as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    however the effect of width increases with distance . for astronomical distances",
    "the effect of finite width is to reduce the group velocity to a weighted average of the velocities of the individual energy eigenstates .",
    "this explains why , even if the opera result is correct , there is no contradiction with the absence of superluminal propagation of neutrinos from supernova sn1987a .",
    "our analysis shows that superluminal propagation of neutrinos occurs whenever the oscillation probability corresponding to that measurement vanishes .",
    "for instance , muon neutrinos are dominantly observed at opera ; these will exhibit superluminal behaviour precisely when the survival probability @xmath63 vanishes .",
    "while @xmath63 does not vanish for the parameter range of the opera measurement , in principle , this feature makes superluminal neutrinos effectively unobservable through conditional measurement as explained in section 2 .",
    "finally we discuss the implication of the opera result irrespective of superluminality or otherwise .",
    "the neutrino mass ordering or hierarchy is not fully known .",
    "the present understanding is that this requires separate measurement of oscillations of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the presence of matter .",
    "the opera measurement of neutrino flavour  velocity \" has added a new way of precision measurement of neutrino parameters and may have significance in the context of neutrino mass hierarchy ( provided the parameters lie in an extremely narrow part of the known range of neutrino parameters ) . a detailed analysis including the effect of matter will be presented elsewhere .",
    "after most of the work reported here was completed , we came across ref.@xcite which overlaps with parts of the present paper .",
    "we thank tim r. morris for bringing to our attention his paper ref .",
    "@xcite in which similar ideas have been discussed . in particular , the extreme fine - tuning of parameters required to produce velocities of the order observed in opera and the difficulty that the effect is seen only at fixed energy was pointed out in this paper .",
    "this paper points out the existence of multiple peaks , that would give rise to a strong energy dependence , in addition ."
