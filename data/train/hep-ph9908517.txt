    "following  @xcite , we present a new approach to the calculation of the diffractive structure functions using a modified version of the model of the stochastic vacuum ( msv ) proposed by rueter  @xcite .",
    "he introduces an energy dependence in a phenomenological way by assuming the existence of two pomerons which couple to the dipoles according to their size : a hard pomeron of exponential type which couples to relative small dipoles such that their radius is bigger than @xmath4 and a soft pomeron having the donnachie - landshoff type  @xcite , that couples to dipoles of hadronic size .",
    "the radial cutoff @xmath5 fm is introduced in order to avoid tiny dipoles for which perturbative gluon exchange has to be taken into account and the non - perturbative model of the stochastic vacuum has to be `` switched off '' .",
    "the process under consideration is the scattering of a virtual photon off a proton : @xmath6 .",
    "the proton scatters elastically remaining unchanged , whereas the photon dissociates in a color - singlet quark - antiquark pair .",
    "we will work in the center - of - mass frame , the natural system for the msv .",
    "we define the following invariants    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the momentum transfer which is purely transversal and small : @xmath9 .",
    "the kinematics of diffractive processes is usually given in terms of the variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the invariant mass of the @xmath13 pair . in a pomeron exchange picture ,",
    "@xmath14 can be interpreted as the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the pomeron and @xmath2 as the momentum fraction of the struck quark within the pomeron .",
    "the momentum transfer and the relative momentum between the quark and the antiquark are given respectively by @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "where @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the transverse momentum of the ( anti-)quark .",
    "the phase space written in terms of the above variables is given by    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the orientation of the relative momentum between the quark and the antiquark and @xmath21 is the orientation of the momentum transfer .",
    "the scattering amplitude and the cross section can be calculated following  @xcite .",
    "using massless quarks we get the following expression for the longitudinal and the transversal structure functions respectively    @xmath22    @xmath23    here , we have summed over helicities and three quark flavors , @xmath24 is the number of quarks , @xmath25 is the ordinary bessel function and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the 2nd . kind modified bessel functions of order @xmath28 and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 and the relative transverse momentum of the @xmath13 pair @xmath31 are given by    @xmath32    notice that there is a cut - off @xmath33 in the @xmath34-integration introduced to avoid the configurations that correspond to @xmath34 near @xmath28 or @xmath29 in which the quark or the antiquark respectively becomes slow in the center - of - mass frame and might spoil the validity of the eikonal approximation as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath35    and can be understood as the dipole - proton scattering amplitude .",
    "the proton wave function in the quark - diquark representation is given by a gaussian function    @xmath36    the function @xmath37 is the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude evaluated in the msv  @xcite .    by performing the integration over @xmath3",
    ", a more inclusive and experimentally more accessible quantity can be defined    @xmath38    notice that in both longitudinal and transversal structure functions there is an explicit factor of the form @xmath39 which is a direct consequence of the kinematics of the process , as can be seen from the expression for the phase space eq .",
    "( [ phasespace ] ) . at first glance",
    ", one would say that our approach admits a factorization of the form    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a pomeron flux factor depending only on @xmath14 . however , this is not the case , since the function @xmath42 depends in a non - trivial way on @xmath43 due to a cut in the z range @xmath44 ( see above ) .",
    "hence for fixed @xmath45 , the function @xmath46 depends on @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence is plotted in figure  [ xpdep ] . for these plots we took the experimental points reported by the zeus collaboration  @xcite ( circles in fig .",
    "[ xpdep ] ) . they have assumed a very small diffractive longitudinal cross section , indeed @xmath47 .",
    "we plotted here the transversal and longitudinal structure function separately .",
    "one can see that although the longitudinal structure function ( dashed line in fig .  [ xpdep ] ) is considerably smaller than the transversal one ( dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ xpdep ] ) , it should not be neglected . from our analysis",
    ", one can observe that although the sum of the longitudinal and transversal contribution will overestimate the experimental values of @xmath48 , alone the transversal structure function fits very good the data and follows the shape    ( 4.5,4.5 ) ( 4.5,0)@xmath14 ( 0,0 )    = 4.5 cm     + ( a ) @xmath49  , @xmath50       ( 4.5,4.5 ) ( 4.5,0)@xmath14 ( 0,0 )    = 4.5 cm     + ( b ) @xmath51  , @xmath52     +    ( 4.5,4.5 ) ( 4.5,0)@xmath14 ( 0,0 )    = 4.5 cm     + ( c ) @xmath53  , @xmath54       ( 4.5,4.5 ) ( 4.5,0)@xmath14 ( 0,0 )    = 4.5 cm     + ( d ) @xmath55  , @xmath56    ( 4.5,4.5 ) ( 5.5,0.2)@xmath43/gev ( 1,2.5 ) ( 0,0 )    = 4.5 cm       ( 4.5,4.5 ) ( 1,4 ) ( 5.5,0.2)@xmath57gev ( 0,0 )    = 4.5 cm    of the curve .",
    "although our calculation yields directly the @xmath3 dependent diffractive structure functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , a direct comparison with the experimental values was not possible .",
    "since the @xmath2 region , where the experimental data are available ( @xmath60  @xcite ) involves very small dipoles and perturbative two gluon exchange should be taken into account .",
    "the physical picture is exactly the same as in the previous section .",
    "the total cross section is proportional to the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude of the process @xmath61 according to the optical theorem and can be written as in  @xcite      where @xmath63 is the wave function for longitudinal and transversal polarized photons  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath64 when averaged over the dipole orientation @xmath21 is the so - called effective dipole - proton cross section        on the other hand , writing the phase space eq .",
    "( [ phasespace ] ) in terms of @xmath3 and the relative transverse momentum of the quark - antiquark pair @xmath31 the differential cross section can be written in terms of @xmath64 as              concerning the @xmath3 dependence , in figure  [ slope ] we plotted the diffractive differential cross section eq .",
    "( [ diffcross ] ) as a function of @xmath3 . by fitting the solid curve to an exponential function eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , we extracted the logarithmic slope @xmath68 .",
    "our results for the logarithmic slope are comparable with the experimental data  @xcite as shown in the following table .",
    "figure  [ ratio ] shows the ratio of the diffractive versus the inclusive cross section as a function of @xmath43 for different values of @xmath45 . our model predicts a growing up ratio with increasing @xmath43 independently from @xmath45 . to get this curve , we have integrated analytically over the whole @xmath2 range ."
