    "in this paper we will report on new results in witten s string field theory @xcite for the off - shell 4-tachyon amplitude that was not fully computed explicitly before . in previous computations",
    "the off - shell factor @xmath1 was obtained in an implicit form @xcite@xcite , while an explicit computation reported only the first two terms in an expansion in the vicinity of the integration limit of the parameter  @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained by using mainly conformal mapping techniques @xcite and followed the methods of giddings original computation @xcite of the on - shell veneziano amplitude , which could be extended to off - shell under the guidance of the oscillator formulation of string field theory @xcite@xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will obtain a fairly comprehensive profile of the off - shell factor @xmath3 in its entire range @xmath4 by giving the explicit form to tenth order in the parameter @xmath2 ( first two terms in agreement with @xcite ) , obtaining a plot in the full range , and computing the critical slope at a turning point in midrange that determines differentiability .",
    "contrary to our result , previously it was thought that the function @xmath3 was not differentiable at @xmath5 where it was not well understood .",
    "these are achieved in the moyal star formulation of witten s string field theory ( msft ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the usual approach of computation starts with a precise formulation of witten s string field theory , such as the oscillator formulation , to derive a formal expression for a string feynman diagram in terms of the cubic vertex defined in terms of the neumann coefficients .",
    "after this step a jump is made to conformal maps from an analog model @xcite and the real computation is performed by using conformal field theory , if the conformal map can be constructed .",
    "the desired conformal maps can be found explicitly only in certain lucky cases , and the four point function is one of them .",
    "the conformal map procedure has been used virtually in every successful analytic computation , while the oscillator basis is directly pursued mainly with numerical studies using level truncation @xcite@xcite because of the complexity of the neumann coefficients .",
    "these have been some of the challenging features of witten s string field theory in various formulations @xcite@xcite that , despite the beauty of witten s basic action , have led to limited results in string field theory .",
    "some of the complexities of other approaches are not present , or take an easier form in msft . in this formulation the string joining star product is the simple moyal product , and this reproduces directly results in string field theory , in agreement with conformal field theory , but without mapping back to conformal field theory or other intermediate steps .",
    "therefore some of the lingering problems in string field theory seem to be good testing grounds for msft .    in this paper",
    "we apply the msft techniques to the off - shell 3-point and 4-point amplitudes .",
    "we will derive the veneziano amplitude directly from msft and determine the off - shell factor far more accurately compared to previous computations . in this process",
    "we demonstrate that msft agrees in detail with other approaches while bringing efficiency into the computations , and also obtain new results in msft that other approaches could test .",
    "we view these computations as a preparation for our ultimate aim which is the investigation of nonperturbative string theory phenomena by using the simpler msft .",
    "we believe the techniques and insights developed in this paper will be useful for this purpose .",
    "in fact we find that some of the new results and insight gained by this work impact the way to compute nonpertubative quantities in string field theory as discussed in section vi .",
    "in the rest of this section we will describe briefly msft and introduce some notation . in section",
    "ii we discuss off - shell 3-point functions .",
    "this is necessary to understand the behavior of the theory with respect to a cutoff in mode space , and to define the physical string coupling as opposed to the bare divergent coupling that appears in the action .",
    "the results we obtain for the off - shell 3-point amplitudes demonstrate detailed agreement between msft and conformal field theory or the oscillator formulation of string field theory .    in section iii",
    "we analyze the off - shell 4-tachyon amplitude .",
    "we show directly from msft , without connecting through conformal field theory , that on - shell we obtain the veneziano amplitude .",
    "furthermore we obtain the off - shell factor @xmath1 and compute the first ten terms in an expansion in powers of @xmath2 , provide a plot in its full range @xmath4 , and determine its differentiability at a turning point .",
    "previously it was thought that the derivative was discontinuous at mid - range and only the lowest two terms were explicitly computed @xcite ( in agreement with our result ) .",
    "our computation provides the most comprehensive information on the off - shell 4-tachyon amplitude produced so far in string field theory .    in section iv we develop the details of the tools that allowed us to perform the computations in sections ii and iii and which would be applicable more generally to other computations .    in section",
    "v we discuss the sl@xmath6 generated by the virasoro generators @xmath7 whose @xmath8 representation deeply underlies the structures that appear in our computations . by using some group theoretic properties of this very special representation of sl@xmath9 we develop tools for computation in string field theory that are needed in our paper to generate numbers .",
    "we also compare the discrete and continuous moyal bases which are simply two different bases of the @xmath10 representation .    in section",
    "vi we discuss some of the impact that our present computations have on the non - perturbative landscape , and then conclude in section vii . in the appendix we give further results produced through the techniques in section iv , and relations to neumann coefficients .",
    "the action of witten s cubic string field theory @xcite in the msft formalism in the siegel gauge is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is given in eqs.([l0],[l0gh ] ) .",
    "the zero mode ghosts have already been dealt with @xcite so they no longer appear .",
    "hence the field",
    "@xmath13 here is equivalent to the physical field in witten s theory .",
    "the string field @xmath14 is written in a mixed position - momentum basis , which is equivalent to a fourier transform of the purely position basis . in this basis string joining is represented by the usual moyal star product @xcite in a noncommutative phase space @xmath15 labelled by the even modes @xmath16 .",
    "the fourier transform in the odd modes maps to the space @xmath17 witten s string joining star product becomes a non - diagonal moyal product in the space @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this is diagonalized by defining @xmath19 as an infinite combination of the @xmath20 by introducing the special matrix @xmath21 given in eq.([tr ] ) . in this way",
    "we arrive to the noncommutative space @xmath22 with a diagonal moyal product whose meaning is string joining . we emphasize that this @xmath19 is a definition in terms of @xmath23 it should not be confused with the first quantized momentum that is canonical to @xmath24 whose representation in this space is the derivative @xmath25 however , interestingly this can be reproduced in the noncommuative geometry ( string joining ) relation @xmath26   _ { \\star}.$ ] a closely related continuous moyal basis @xcite is obtained by orthogonality transformations , as will be discussed later in the paper . ] the star product @xmath27 is local in the midpoint variable @xmath28 and is independent for each @xmath29 this separation of variables and the simplicity of the moyal star are the main conceptual and practical simplifications that lead to new progress by overcoming midpoint problems in other approaches and opening up easier computational techniques in msft .    it has been shown in @xcite-@xcite through some explicit computations that msft is in full agreement with other computational approaches to witten s string field theory , including the oscillator formulation and conformal field theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , the moyal star reproduces the neumann coefficients that define the vertices in the oscillator formulation of string field theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the msft propagator has the usual free string spectrum .",
    "therefore , even though it is a very different computational formalism , due to the one to one correspondence described in @xcite we expect identical final results between msft and oscillator approach computations of any string feynman graph . this expectation will be confirmed in detail in this paper .",
    "this demonstrates once again , and in greater detail , that msft is a precise representation of witten s string field theory .",
    "the string in 26 dimensions is supplemented with two additional fermionic dimensions that describe the conformal ghosts @xmath30 with the appropriate generalization of the moyal star product for fermions .",
    "the traditional perturbative string states ( tachyon , vector , etc . ) are identified through the usual expansion@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the perturbative vacuum string field configuration and @xmath33 is a differential operator representation of string oscillators in the space @xmath34 @xcite@xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is a specific normalized gaussian @xmath36 , that represents the vacuum @xmath37 including ghosts @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is given by@xmath38 where @xmath39 are the non - commutative coordinates written as a doublet for each @xmath40 , with the bosonic part @xmath41 for matter and fermionic part @xmath42 for the @xmath43 ghosts with @xmath44 and the sp@xmath45 metric @xmath46 for the sake of connecting with an upcoming paper in which we will discuss some useful hidden symmetries that connect matter and ghosts in the msft formalism , and further simplify the structure and computations . ] .",
    "each pair @xmath47 satisfies standard commutation / anticommutation rules under the star product .",
    "these can be written compactly as @xmath48_{\\star}=\\eta^{\\mu\\nu } \\sigma_{ij}$ ] for matter and @xmath49 for ghosts , where the symbol @xmath50 is the pauli matrix @xmath51 in the doublet space multiplied with a noncommutativity parameter @xmath52 we take @xmath53 by a choice of units .",
    "the @xmath54 that appears in the vacuum state @xmath55 is a matrix in mode space determined by @xmath56 as shown in @xcite .",
    "although @xmath54 is a simple matrix , we will not need it explicitly in this paper .",
    "the perturbative particle fields @xmath57 etc . are expressed as functions of the center of mass @xmath58 the star product @xmath27 is local in the midpoint of the string @xmath59 , not in the center of mass @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , before evaluating the interaction for any perturbative field @xmath57 etc",
    ". one must first write the center of mass in terms of the midpoint @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "this is a crucial step in computations of the star products .",
    "the midpoint had been a source of numerous problems in the split string formalism , and the resolution first was given in the context of msft in @xcite with the simple prescription just described .    in the quadratic term",
    "the star product plays no role , and could be removed , as is usual for the moyal product .",
    "the coefficient of the quadratic term in the action is chosen such that the particle fields are correctly normalized ( after taking into account the definitions of the trace @xmath63 including ghosts and the virasoro operator @xmath12 as given in @xcite ) @xmath64 then from the cubic term one finds the feynman rules and computes the amplitudes as described in @xcite@xcite .",
    "for each external line we insert a string field representative of a particle .",
    "in particular an incoming tachyon with momentum @xmath65 is represented by the string field @xmath66 where @xmath35 is the normalized vacuum field given above , and @xmath67 is the center of mass plane wave which is part of @xmath68 . to compute its interactions",
    "one must write it in the form @xmath69 which is a shifted gaussian in @xmath22 space .",
    "these details are fully explained in @xcite-@xcite , where it is also shown how to compute the star product and the trace with efficient methods based on a monoid algebra of shifted gaussians @xcite .    in the expressions below the constant matrix @xmath70 and vectors",
    "@xmath71 in even / odd mode space ( and related matrices @xmath72 @xmath73 ) are fundamental matrices in msft that encode the joining of strings @xcite-@xcite , and are given explicitly in eqs.([v],[tr ] ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath74 are diagonal matrices that represent the odd / even oscillator frequencies @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath16 as in eq.([kappa ] ) below .",
    "a bar on top of a square or column matrix symbol , such as @xmath78 etc . means the transpose of the matrix . in certain computations , to avoid associativity anomalies these infinite matrices must be replaced with their regulated @xmath79 version as given in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and then @xmath80 must be sent to infinity at the end .",
    "the regulated matrices obey some nice algebraic properties which are also shared by the infinite matrices , thereby permitting analytic computation in the finite @xmath80 version .",
    "a particular form of the regulator which we have found useful in some computations is given in footnote [ regulator ] .",
    "it is necessary to use the regulator in those computations where we suspect anomalous behavior , but otherwise the unregulated matrices can be used , as we will do for most of the computations in this paper .",
    "it is interesting to note that the regulated matrices with only a few modes ( small @xmath80 ) reproduce approximately most of the numerical results we obtain with more sophisticated methods at @xmath81 .",
    "an example is the neumann matrices as given in the appendix of @xcite , and many of the numbers computed in the current paper , although we do not make the effort to demonstrate this point in this paper .",
    "in this section first we briefly outline the off - shell 3-point functions to establish the relation between the bare coupling @xmath82 that appears in the action of msft and the on - shell tachyon coupling @xmath83 which is identified with the string coupling .",
    "the relation between the two involves a factor which diverges with the number of modes @xmath84 as @xmath85 as will be explained later .",
    "all other scattering amplitudes are proportional to some power of the bare coupling @xmath86 and this must be first written in terms of the finite on - shell tachyon coupling @xmath87 .",
    "after this step , it is seen that all amplitudes are finite . in this process one",
    "finds a renormalization factor in front of the amplitudes multiplying a power of the on - shell coupling @xmath87 .",
    "an example of this is the factor @xmath88 for the 4-tachyon amplitude in eq.([a4 ] ) below .",
    "the off - shell 3-tachyon amplitude is obtained by using the feynman rules ( note @xmath89 ) and inserting the tachyon field for the external leg in the feynman graph , leading to the expression@xmath90 the @xmath59 integral gives a momentum conservation delta function @xmath91 , while the trace and star products are easily evaluated by using the bose / fermi monoid rules developed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath92 multiplied with the delta function .",
    "this is in full agreement with previous studies of the off - shell 3-tachyon amplitude @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it gives precisely @xmath87 on shell by definition @xmath93 with @xmath94 this is obtained easily by evaluating the star products and trace in eq.([g123int ] ) by using the simple monoid methods in @xcite@xcite .",
    "using the definition of @xmath54 this simplifies to @xmath95 which is then evaluated as @xmath96 later in this paper in eqs.([intvv],[intvv2 ] ) , to produce the result in eq.([g123 ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the same computation , the relation between the on - shell @xmath87 and the bare coupling @xmath82 initially takes the following form @xmath97 after inserting @xmath98 it becomes @xmath99 the right hand side of eq.([g ] ) is divergent as @xmath100 which becomes @xmath101 for @xmath102 as will be later shown in eq.([bare ] ) .",
    "however this divergence is everywhere reabsorbed into the definition of the on shell @xmath87 just as in the 3-tachyon case . after this step ,",
    "there still remains similar determinants that individually produce a divergence or zeroes at large @xmath103 but they combine together to give finite answers magically as long as @xmath104 we will see an example of this impressive fact below in the 4-tachyon amplitude ( see the determinants in eq.([a4 ] ) and the computation in eqs.([dets ] , ) ) .",
    "a similar computation can be performed for the vector particle for an incoming wave with momentum @xmath65 , which is represented by the string field @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the polarization and the last factor @xmath107 resulted from applying the oscillator @xcite@xcite @xmath108 .",
    "for example , the coupling between the vector and two tachyons is ( omitting the chan - paton factors at the string ends)@xmath109 following the monoid methods in @xcite@xcite that led to eq.([g123 ] ) this is evaluated in almost the same way , giving @xmath110 with an implied momentum conservation delta function as in eq.([g123 ] ) .",
    "this result is in full agreement with the on - shell result in @xcite ( for @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) , as well as the off - shell results summarized in @xcite .",
    "to arrive at this result we needed to perform the computation of the following numerical coefficient @xmath113 this computation , and those for similar quantities will be given later in this paper in eq.([b1 ] ) .",
    "we see that msft is in full agreement with previous computations in string field theory for off - shell 3-point functions .",
    "previous methods used conformal maps @xcite and conformal field theory , while msft uses the moyal product , and produces the same results with considerably simpler methods .",
    "one can go on computing very simply off - shell 3-point couplings for any other perturbative or non - perturbative fields by similar msft techniques .",
    "one of the new results in our paper is a proof that the msft 4-tachyon amplitude produced by the moyal product does give directly the veneziano amplitude , without using conformal mapping techniques .",
    "a second new result is a comprehensive understanding of the off - shell factor by going considerably further in the parametric expansion , obtaining a plot of the function in the full range , and determining its differentiability at a turning point .",
    "in msft we have been developing analytic methods of computation in string field theory by using directly the moyal star product .",
    "both the oscillator formalism and msft provide an expression for any off - shell amplitude , including loops .",
    "although the starting point and intermediate steps are quite different , it has been argued that generally we expect agreement in the result @xcite@xcite .",
    "the computation of the 4-tachyon off - shell amplitude in msft was performed in @xcite@xcite .",
    "there are 8 diagrams that correspond to various permutations of the four external legs .",
    "the @xmath114-channel diagram @xmath115 is denoted as @xmath116 the mathematical expression for this amplitude was obtained in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath117-channel diagram is given by the cyclic permutation of the external legs @xmath118 and its mathematical expression amounts to exchanging @xmath119 in the previous result .",
    "the remaining permutations that do not change the @xmath119 channel properties are denoted as @xmath120 @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 respectively . after a brief computation ( as in @xcite )",
    "it can be shown that these give the same amplitudes as the initial @xmath119 diagrams .",
    "therefore the sum of the diagrams for the @xmath119 channels produces a factor of 4 @xmath126   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 are the mandelstam variables should not ne confused with the matrix @xmath127 @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the functions @xmath130 initially given in @xcite were further simplified in @xcite . here , as a first step ,",
    "we simplify these functions further with a few algebraic steps and put them into the following form which will be convenient in our analysis @xmath131   ^{d/2}},\\;d=26.\\label{a4}\\ ] ] the overall factor of 4 in @xmath132 is the factor in eq.([atau ] ) . in string mode space",
    "labelled by even and odd positive integers @xmath16 and @xmath133 we have defined the matrices @xmath134 vector @xmath135 and scalar @xmath136 as follows ( a bar above a symbol means matrix transpose)@xmath137{cc}e & 0\\\\ 0 & o \\end{array } \\right )   , \\;m=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}\\left (   \\frac{1-t\\bar{t}}{3+t\\bar{t}}\\right )   _ { ee^{\\prime } } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\left (   \\frac{1-\\bar{t}t}{3+\\bar{t}t}\\right )   _ { oo^{\\prime}}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\;\\tilde{m}=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}\\left (   \\frac{1-t\\bar{t}}{1 + 3t\\bar{t}}\\right )   _ { ee^{\\prime } } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\left (   \\frac{1-\\bar{t}t}{1 + 3\\bar{t}t}\\right )   _ { oo^{\\prime}}\\end{array } \\right )   \\label{kappa}\\\\ b &   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}b_{e}\\\\ b_{o}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\;p^{\\left (   o\\right )   } = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\;\\omega\\equiv\\bar{b}\\left (   1-m\\right )   ^{-1}b.\\label{b}\\ ] ] here the diagonal matrix @xmath138 with integer eigenvalues @xmath139 represents the spectrum of string oscillation frequencies ( eigenvalues of @xmath12 ) , @xmath140 is a projector onto the odd modes only .",

    "furthermore , it was shown that all neumann matrices , for all @xmath147-point vertices , are explicit functions of the matrix @xmath70 as obtained in @xcite@xcite .",

    "we will show that the on - shell amplitude for @xmath158 reduces to the veneziano amplitude given by the beta function @xmath159 on the other hand the off - shell expression above goes beyond conformal field theory which only gives information for on - shell strings .",

    "this discussion provides the most comprehensive result for the off - shell scattering amplitude of four tachyons produced so far in string field theory .",

    "generally it is seen that a few modes already give an answer pretty close to the @xmath294 limit , therefore for a quick estimate of non - divergent quantities it is generally sufficient to use finite matrices for just a few modes @xmath80 . with this approach",
    "we can evaluate any quantity approximately fairly easily .",
    "the large @xmath80 limit is sometimes subtle because of anomalies .",
    "generally anomalies arise in the form of a zero multiplied by an infinity that comes from an infinite sum over matrix indices ( the modes ) producing @xmath295 , so that there is a subtle finite contribution .",
    "if one is not careful the zero is first evaluated and the infinite sum that is later performed still gives zero , thus missing the finite contribution . to avoid anomaly subtleties in the @xmath294 limit we use the regulated version of @xmath292 in all computations ( see @xcite@xcite ) , and take the @xmath294 only at the end of the computation .",
    "the regulated matrices @xmath292",
    "satisfy certain algebraic relations , also shared by the unregulated matrices , that make it possible to perform certain computations analytically .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this is a correct regulator consistent with other computational techniques in string theory .    in certain computations , or parts of it , there are no anomalies , and it becomes possible to work with the infinite unregulated matrices @xmath296 directly at @xmath81 .",
    "then it is possible to make a transformation to the basis that diagonalizes the infinite unregulated matrix @xmath70 and do the computations in the @xmath81 diagonal basis . at @xmath81",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath70 are continuous and are parameterized by a continuous variable @xmath297 and furthermore the transformation is known explicitly @xcite . as we will discuss in detail in the next section , at @xmath81 the discrete and continuous bases are just different bases of sl@xmath6 in the @xmath8 unitary representation , in which @xmath70 can be understood as the matrix elements of the operator @xmath298 in the discrete basis that diagonalizes @xmath12 .",
    "the continuous basis is the basis in which this operator is diagonal .    a priori it is hard to know when to expect an anomaly if one works directly at @xmath81 .",

    "this could be done by treating the energy of the midpoint ( called @xmath607 ) as a perturbation and writing the rest of @xmath12 as a special star product form @xmath608 .",
    "all solutions of eq.([eom ] ) , including the vacuum , were obtained exactly in the absence of @xmath607 .",
    "then it was possible to setup a perturbation series in the midpoint energy @xmath607 and compute analytically each term order by order .",

    "the next perturbation @xmath613 was also computed explicitly , while higher orders @xmath614 could be computed in a straightforward way with similar methods .",
    "finally the energy of the vacuum and the tension of the d@xmath606 brane were given analytically up to second order in @xmath607 @xmath615 with@xmath616    when this result was obtained the divergent nature of @xmath617 and @xmath618 were confusing . however the divergence of the bare coupling constant @xmath82 was not noticed .",
    "we have seen in this paper in eqs.([g],[bare ] ) that @xmath619 a quick look at @xmath620 show that they are both linearly divergent with @xmath621 as can be seen in a naive level truncation up to @xmath621 by inserting @xmath622 , @xmath623 and using the unregulated @xmath624 then the result for @xmath625 is perfectly finite at each order of the midpoint energy @xmath607 since the factors of @xmath626 cancel between numerator and denominator in eq.([tension ] ) .",
    "thus , this nonperturbative computation should proceed by using the same regulator consistently , keeping only the leading terms to order @xmath626 in the numerator and dropping everything non - leading .",

    "we had commented before in previous papers that the terms involving @xmath630 are tricky .",
    "even though they appear to vanish as @xmath294 they actually contribute a finite term because infinite sums cancel the zero .",
    "the midpoint energy @xmath607 mentioned above is in fact just the piece of @xmath12 proportional to @xmath631    but how about the divergent term in the first line @xmath632 involving the center of mass momentum @xmath633 this divergence caused concern for some colleagues .",
    "actually we can explain that this is the correct behavior of this term because otherwise there will be no center of mass momentum dependence in the large @xmath80 limit in nonperturbative physics .",
    "let us start with the cubic term @xmath634 and replace @xmath13 with @xmath635 so that it takes the form @xmath636 doing the same to the quadratic term , we rewrite the action with an overall @xmath637 as @xmath638 now it has the form of the computed nonperturbative energy in eq.([tension ] ) and , from the discussion we gave above , we see that the numerator must behave like @xmath639 to compensate for the behavior of @xmath640 in the denominator .",
    "it is clear that each @xmath641 accounts for a factor of @xmath80 in the numerator and also that @xmath12 contributes a factor of @xmath80 in the quadratic term .",
    "now , if we also include momentum dependence ( or @xmath59 dependence ) in @xmath12 the only way that momentum will not be negligible is by getting the help from the factor @xmath642 in the form that it appears in @xmath643 this explains that this factor has precisely the correct behavior , and how it contributes in nonperturbative phenomena .    of course , there is a way of eliminating the confusing factor by renormalizing @xmath644 and defining @xmath645 and further absorbing the extra factors in a definition @xmath646 then in the new @xmath647 every sum is divided by the factor @xmath642 which is reminiscent of the finite quantities @xmath648 in large @xmath80 matrix theories . if the theory is redefined in this manner in terms of @xmath649 then every term of the action in every computation should be finite at every step , just like the leading terms in large @xmath80 matrix theories .",
