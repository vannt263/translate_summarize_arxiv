    "in these lectures , we will deal with a class of groups called _ hyperlinear groups , _ as well as its ( possibly proper ) subclass , that of _ sofic groups .",
    "_ one natural way to get into this line of research is through the theory of operator algebras . here ,",
    "the hyperlinear groups are sometimes referred to as `` groups admitting matrix models '' .",
    "this can be indeed interpreted as a genuine model - theoretic statement , within a suitable version of logic .",
    "namely , a group @xmath0 is said to admit matrix models if every existential sentence of the first - order theory of @xmath0 is satisfied in matrix groups .    what makes the concept interesting  and difficult to work with  is that at the matrix group end it is not the classical first - order logic that one has in mind , but rather a version of continuous logic with truth values in the unit interval @xmath1 $ ] . by way of motivation ,",
    "let us try to understand first what we get by considering a class of groups admitting matrix models in the sense of the traditional binary logic .",
    "the language of group theory , which we will denote @xmath2 , is a first - order predicate calculus with equality , having one ternary predicate letter @xmath3 and a constant symbol @xmath4 .",
    "the group operation is coded as follows : @xmath5 if @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , we have variables , the equality symbol @xmath7 , logical connectives , and quantifiers . now consider a ( countable ) group @xmath0 .",
    "a formula is said to be a _ sentence _ if all its variables are bound within quantifiers .",
    "these formulas say something definite about the structure of a group , hence the following definition .",
    "the _ theory _ of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath8 , is defined to be the set of all sentences of the predicate calculus @xmath2 which are valid in @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the language is first - order implies that the variables only range over @xmath0 ( and not , for instance , over families of subsets of @xmath0 ) .",
    "we will further denote by @xmath9 the subset of @xmath8 consisting of all existential first - order sentences , that is , those of the form @xmath10 .",
    "let us introduce an _ ad hoc _ notion .",
    "say that @xmath0 _ admits matrix models `` in the classical sense , '' _ if every quantifier - free ( open ) formula in first order logic can be satisfied in @xmath11 for some @xmath12 and some field @xmath13 .",
    "even more precisely : whenever @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an open formula and @xmath16 , then , for a suitable natural number @xmath12 and some @xmath17 , @xmath18 here we take matrix groups to be as general as possible : all groups of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath19 and @xmath13 is an arbitrary field , are allowed .    what groups admit matrix models `` in the classical sense ''",
    "it turns out this class can be described in a very transparent way , and does not in fact depend on the choice of a field @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain this description in the rest of the present section .",
    "first , a preliminary observation .",
    "[ obs:1 ] a group @xmath0 admits matrix models `` in the classical sense '' if and only if @xmath0 locally embeds into matrix groups , that is , for every finite @xmath20 there is a natural number @xmath12 , a field @xmath13 , and an injective map @xmath21 so that , whenever @xmath22 and @xmath23 , one has @xmath24    such a mapping @xmath25 as above is called a _ local monomorphism , _ or a _ partially defined monomorphism . _",
    "the _ necessity _ follows from the fact that the conjunction of all the formulas of the form @xmath26 , @xmath27 , as well as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is satisfied in @xmath0 and so in a suitable linear group .",
    "here we denote @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are chosen as in the paragraph preceding the observation .    to prove _ sufficiency _ , let @xmath35 be an open formula satisfied in @xmath0 .",
    "write @xmath15 in a disjunctive normal form .",
    "the atomic formulas are of the form @xmath36 , @xmath5 , or @xmath37 .",
    "all occurences of atoms of the type @xmath37 can be replaced with formulas @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a new variable suitably interpreted in @xmath0 .",
    "denote @xmath40 the resulting open formula , having probably more variables , which is satisfied in @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath40 is written in a disjunctive normal form , with atomic formulas of the kind either @xmath36 or @xmath5 .",
    "as a consequence of our assumptions , a conjunctive clause of such atoms is satisfied in some @xmath11 , and the same of course applies to the disjunction of a set of conjuctive clauses .",
    "since @xmath41 , the formula @xmath15 is satisfied in @xmath11 as well .    to take the next step , we introduce the following notion .",
