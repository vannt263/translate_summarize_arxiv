    "it is a plausible assumption that in this case and for the low - frequency laser field , the polarized bound state carries negligible current incident on the barrier , and that tunnelling would occur from the tail of the initial wave - function already present under the barrier . since the initial wave - function is real - valued in the barrier region , the phase in eq .",

    "production of a coherent superposition of many ionic states and hence of coherent hole dynamics is the key aspect of interaction with ultra - short light pulses .",

    "not all phases are mapped into time : the formation of the hole wavepacket is characterised not only by the overall time - delays , but also by additional phases accumulated during the ionisation process due to the different core potentials for the different final states of the ion .",

    "given that the electron wavepackets correlated to different core states overlap at the detector , the hole presents a coherent wavepacket characterised by the relative phases of its different spectral components .",
