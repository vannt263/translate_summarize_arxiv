    "conformal field theory ( cft ) was born to describe fixed points of renormalization group flows .",
    "this still remains its main vocation , although it has many other applications as well . in 2d ,",
    "the constraining power of conformal symmetry is tremendous and often leads to an exact solution of the theory . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the much less constrained 4d case . presumably , there are lots of interacting 4d cfts out there , but we do nt know much about them .",
    "for instance , conformal windows \" of gauge theories should provide lots of examples , but even the spectrum of these theories remains unknown ( except for the chiral ring in the supersymmetric case ) .    in absence of an exact solution ,",
    "it is natural to look for universal constraints , satisfied all over the landscape \" of cfts .",
    "two years ago @xcite,@xcite we found one such constraint , related to a gap in the spectrum of operator dimensions .",
    "namely , we examined the maximal possible dimension of the lowest - dimension operator appearing in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of two scalar operators .",
    "we found that if one fixes the dimension of external scalars , the lowest - dimension operator that appears can not have a dimension above a certain model - independent bound .",
    "last year a different constraint was presented in @xcite : it was found that the ope coefficient of three scalars can not exceed a certain universal @xmath5 bound , which depends only on their dimensions .",
    "one can call this bound a universal limit on the interaction strength .",
    "the above results were obtained by using consistency between ope and crossing symmetry ( also known as ope associativity ) as a constraining principle .",
    "the principle itself was first proposed more than 35 years ago by polyakov @xcite , but until our work no general results were obtained from it .",
    "we would like to mention a parallel line of development in 2d cft , where hellerman @xcite and others @xcite,@xcite have also studied constraints on the gap in the spectrum , in terms of the central charge .",
    "their main constraining principle is modular invariance , which is limited to 2d , but morally not so different from ope associativity ( both are related to the change of foliation when quantizing the theory ) .",
    "also interesting is the role played by all these universal constraints in an ambitious program of exploring the space of cfts initiated by douglas @xcite .",
    "coming back to 4d , in this note we will explore the following question : _ what can we say about the central charge of the theory , if we know something about the spectrum of its operator dimensions ?",
    "_ more precisely , we will assume that the theory contains a scalar operator of a given dimension .",
    "under this assumption , we will show that the central charge must be bigger that a certain universal lower bound .",
    "this is natural , since central charge measures \" the number of degrees of freedom , and by assumption we know that our theory is not trivial .    in a certain range of scalar dimensions",
    "we will be able to show that the central charge is necessarily bigger than that of the free scalar ( interacting theory has more degrees of freedom ) .    as we will explain below , the problem of bounding the central charge _ from below _",
    "is equivalent to the problem of bounding _ from above _ the ope coefficient of the stress tensor  in the scalar times scalar ope .",
    "the similarity with the problem analyzed in @xcite is then clear , and we will be able to use the method of that paper . to make connection with the results of @xcite,@xcite , we will also study how the central charge bound improves as a function of the assumed gap in the scalar sector of the ope .",
    "everywhere we assume that we are dealing with a unitary theory . in a non - unitary theory , central charge may well be zero ( or negative ) without cft being trivial , so our question would not even make sense .",
    "we begin by stating precisely our assumptions and goals .    in an arbitrary unitary cft in @xmath6 spacetime dimensions , we consider the central charge @xmath7 , defined as the coefficient in the 2-point function of the stress tensor operator @xmath8:@xmath9   \\,,\\nonumber\\\\ i_{\\mu\\nu }   &   = \\delta_{\\mu\\nu}-2x_{\\mu}x_{\\nu}/x^{2 } \\label{eq : tt}\\ ] ] ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is assumed that the stress tensor is normalized canonically , that is consistently with the ward identities ( written here schematically for scalars):@xmath11 the central charge @xmath7 is an interesting quantity because it provides a certain measure of the number of degrees of freedom in the theory .",
    "for example , for a free conformal theory of @xmath12 scalars , @xmath13 dirac fermions , and @xmath14 vectors , we have @xcite@xmath15 moreover , by unitarity @xmath16 , and @xmath17 corresponds to a trivial theory .",
    "it is well known that @xmath7 is an imperfect measure since , unlike in 2d , it does not in general decrease along the rg flow @xcite . the other central charge @xmath18 , defined in terms of the 4d trace anomaly , fares better in this respect @xcite , while still remaining imperfect @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we will stick to @xmath7 since it is the one which we are able to constrain .",
    "now assume that our theory contains a primary hermitean is not hermitean , we can consider its real and imaginary parts . ]",
    "scalar operator @xmath19 of a given dimension @xmath20 our main goal will be to show that under this assumption , the central charge of the theory can not become arbitrarily small . in other words , there exists a certain universal bound@xmath21 where @xmath22 depends on @xmath23 but is otherwise model - independent . in this paper",
    "we will derive such a bound in the interval @xmath24",
    "we will approach this problem by imposing the constraint of ope associativity in the 4-point function of the operator @xmath19 .",
    "consider all primary hermitean operators appearing in the ope @xmath25:@xmath26 here in the first line we included the unit operator and all scalar primaries , starting from a certain dimension @xmath27 and higher . in the second line we have the stress tensor ( spin 2 , dimension 4 primary ) and possibly higher dimension spin 2 fields .",
    "the third line contains all higher spin primaries ( @xmath28 by the unitarity bounds @xcite ) .",
    "note that by permutation symmetry of the @xmath29 state only even spins can appear in this ope .",
    "now , it has been shown by dolan and osborn @xcite that every primary spin @xmath30 dimension @xmath31 operator @xmath32 appearing in the @xmath33 ope with a coefficient @xmath34 gives a contribution to the 4-point function of @xmath19 of the following form:@xmath35@xmath36 the functions of the cross - ratios @xmath37 are called conformal blocks . they can be thought of as summing up the contributions of the primary @xmath32 and all its descendants to the 4-point function of @xmath19 , when applying the ope in the @xmath38 channel .",
    "it is nontrivial that such summation can be performed in closed form .",
    "the clear advantage of the representation ( [ eq : contr ] ) is that it can be used at finite point separation , unlike the ope which is only useful in the coincidence limit @xmath39 .",

    "this is in accord with what happens for example in ads / cft @xcite , where @xmath47 while the stress tensor contribution corresponds to the graviton exchange in the bulk , which is @xmath48 suppressed .",
    "theories without stress tensor ( i.e. in which @xmath49 ) should be viewed as theories with an infinite central charge .",
    "one example of such a theory is the gaussian scalar field of dimension @xmath50 , see @xcite for its conformal block decomposition .",
    "however in this paper we are interested in constraining the opposite limit of small @xmath7 , in which the stress tensor contribution increases .",
    "as we will see below , such an increase eventually becomes inconsistent with crossing symmetry , and this will give us the bound ( [ eq : bound ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the analytic structure of the conformal blocks .",
    "the variable @xmath51 appearing in ( [ eq : confblock ] ) may look ad hoc , but in fact it is the 4d analogue of the usual complex variable of the 2d cft , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in the euclidean signature @xmath51 is complex and @xmath52 . in this case the conformal blocks are real functions , smooth everywhere away from @xmath53 and from the @xmath54 cut along the real axis .",
    "since the imaginary part of the hypergeometrics is discontinuous across the cut , the conformal blocks have a @xmath55 singularity there . everywhere else on the real axis , and away from it",
    ", they are regular .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of conformal blocks as @xmath56 is fixed by the ope .",
    "the singular behavior in the @xmath57 limit , which corresponds to the crossed channel @xmath58 , has no simple physical meaning .",
    "however , the sum over all blocks must be crossing symmetric and thus consistent with the ope in the crossed channel as well . because of the unphysicall singularities , it is not immediately clear how to impose the ope consistency in the crossed channel .",
    "in fact for this reason polyakov @xcite suggested to use a different type of expansion , into objects he called unitary blocks .",
    "however at the time the explicit and simple expressions ( [ eq : confblock ] ) were of course not yet known .",
    "armed with these expressions , a different strategy becomes possible .",
    "namely , we will study the crossing symmetry condition at finite point separation , which can be written as@xmath59 where we used the fact that crossing @xmath60 corresponds to the interchange of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the sum over all contributing conformal blocks:@xmath64 where @xmath65 are the squares of the ope coefficients , and we separated the contribution of the unit operator",
    ". it will be important that in a unitary theory all @xmath34 are real , so that their squares are positive @xcite .    instead of going straight to the crossed ope limit @xmath58",
    ", we will study ( [ eq : crossing ] ) around the democratic configuration .",
    "] when @xmath66 is at equal distances from @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath69 in fact the same configuration can be mapped conformally to 4 operators inserted at the vertices of a square ( fig .",
    "[ fig : square ] ) .",
    "both sides of ( [ eq : crossing ] ) are regular around @xmath70 . expanding the crossing condition into a two - dimensional power series around this point",
    ", we get a infinite number of linear equations , which have to be satisfied for some positive coefficients @xmath65 . which @xmath71 will enter the expansion with nonzero coefficients depends on the cft .",
    "the problem of unphysical singularities , brought up by polyakov @xcite , is resolved as follows .",
    "the lhs of ( [ eq : crossing ] ) is smooth away from the cut along @xmath72 while the rhs away from ( @xmath73 , since the crossing maps @xmath74 . assuming that both sides can be analytically continued from their region of convergence , the cuts",
    "_ must _ cancel when summing over all @xmath31 and @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , imposing that there is no cut should give no additional constraints compared to the ones that we are using , although it may be a different and perhaps a useful way to package the same information .",
