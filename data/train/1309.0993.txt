    "now , we consider a two - body system which are confined in our time - dependent spherical trap .",
    "a novel feature of the causal description of a many - body system is the non - local connection of particles : dependence of instantaneous motion of any one particle to the coordinates of all other particles at the same time . in this case",
    "the particle trajectories @xmath98 are determined by the following system of two simultaneous differential equations @xmath99 if the particles are identical the wavefunction of the system must be symmetrized .",
    "there are different statistics , fermi - dirac ( fd ) for which total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of particles in the system and bose - einstein ( be ) for which total wavefunction is symmetric under the exchange of particles . when particles are distinguishable they are independent obeying maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics .",
    "in bohmian perspective the particles are always distinguishable in all cases @xcite .",

    "as particles are classically non - interacting this expression will be preserved by the schrdinger evolution .",
    "in this work the problem of a one - body and a two - body system confined in time - dependent traps were studied for particular initial conditions . for the one - body case we gave analytical relations for quantum effective force .",
    "it was seen that when the particle is initially in an energy eigenstate of a smaller box , irrespective of the size of the smaller box expectation value of the momentum operator does not change with time while for the corresponding 1d system the behavior is different .",
    "a selection of bohmian trajectories computed for a particle initially in an energy eigenstate of the time - dependent circular and spherical boxes for different values of the wall velocity .",
    "for the two - particle system details of motions implied by nonfactorizable wavefunctions are subtle : one can not say that fermions are repelled and bosons are attracted , in comparison with distinguishable particles obeying mb statistics .",
    "the root mean square separation confirms one s expectation : it is less ( more ) in be ( fd ) case than in the mb one . in both one - body and two - body system moving wall makes the system to be non - stationary as a result of which bohmian particles move .",
