    "the tunneling of a particle through a barrier is one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental quantum processes . over eighty years ago",
    ", it was suggested that there is a time duration associated with such a process @xcite . among the various proposed expressions",
    "@xcite , wigner - smith delay or group delay ( @xmath0 ) @xcite and dwell time ( @xmath1 ) @xcite are two well - established times , which describe the reflection or transition of a pulse peak and the momentary capture and release of a tunneling particle , respectively .",
    "1d tunneling group delay stems from the phase shift introduced by scattering at the interfaces @xcite .",
    "it can be given by the eigenvalues of the wigner - smith time - delay matrix , or equivalently expressed by the change rate of the phase shift with respect to angular frequency @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , see , fig .",
    "1b ) are the reflection ( transmission ) coefficient and corresponding phase shift , respectively . in the 2d tunneling case ,",
    "there generally is a nonzero lateral goos - hnchen ( gh ) shift @xcite of the reflected or transmitted beam along corresponding interface @xcite ( see fig .",
    "obviously , it intrinsically modifies the phase shift at the interface , thus plays an important role in the 2d group delay .",
    "this fact has been noticed in optics @xcite but long - term ignored in the condensed matter context . instead , eq . ( 1 ) containing",
    "only the scattering component has been widely used in earlier reports ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . accordingly , the 2d hartman effect @xcite , a central issue of the group delay , needs to be revisited . on the other hand , measurements of the tunneling process are essential for all attosecond experiments . very recently , group delay measurements are eventually achieved in _ atoms and molecules _ by approaches with rich skills @xcite",
    ". however , these approaches are not feasible in _ condensed matters _ due to the fact that the numerous electrons on the fermi surface are hard to be detected individually . for a long term",
    ", this dilemma has made the group delay being considered to be of little physical significance in this context @xcite .",
    "so , to propose a feasible approach in such a context is a fundamental subject and still a key challenge in the field .",
    "very recently , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite made an attempt in graphene by using a larmor clock @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis was restricted to the dirac point and the improper definition of 2d group delay was adopted .    in this work",
    ", we demonstrate the effect of the gh shift on the 2d group delay and propose an approach for measuring group delay in 2d ballistic electronic systems .",
    "we take graphene @xcite as an example and show that the gh shift contributes an intrinsic component which adds an asymmetric feature to the 2d group delay .",
    "we find that the 2d dwell time can be related to a weak - field spin precession experiment and we derive a relation between the group delay and dwell time , whereby we reveal that , the 2d group delay ( and hence the intrinsic effect of the gh shift on it ) can be directly observed through simple conductance measurements in this experiment .",
    "such an approach provides a general tool for group delay measurement in 2d ballistic electronic systems , and is much easier to be realized than the ones used in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we at last _ analytically _ resolve the 2d hartman effect in graphene and investigate the proposed observable at the dirac point .",
    "let us consider a 2d quantum tunneling through a barrier in graphene @xcite ( see , fig .",
    "1 ) . the electron possesses fermi energy @xmath7 and a central incident angle of @xmath8 . in the stationary state description",
    ", the electron can be represented as a wave packet as a weighted superposition of plane waves ( each being a solution of dirac s equation ) .",
    "the appearing locus and time of the packet peak ( equivalently , the electron ) are determined by the condition that the gradient of the total phase in the wave vector ( @xmath9 ) space must vanish .",
    "this is similar to the optical case @xcite . a comparison of the conditions in direction for the reflected ( transmitted ) and the incident beam provides corresponding lateral shift @xcite , @xmath10 and @xmath11 [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . here",
    "` @xmath12 ' stands for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 component of the graphene spinor , respectively .",
    "a comparison of the conditions in magnitude gives the average 2d group delay in reflection and transmission , @xmath15 where average values @xmath16",
    "( @xmath17 for a symmetric barrier ) have be used since the two components are simply added in the group delay . for asymmetric barriers ,",
    "there is a difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the 2d group delay is defined as @xmath20 . in view of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is due to the scattering and @xmath23 results from the gh shift .",
    "it is noted that the gh component has been widely ignored in the condensed matter context , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite . at time",
    "@xmath24 the wave front of the transmitted beam reaches @xmath25 and then propagates freely with a velocity of @xmath26 to the final position @xmath27 , which will cost a duration of @xmath28 since the wave front is perpendicular to the propagation direction .",
    "this picture also holds for the reflected beam .",
    "a weighted average of the transmission and reflection gives @xmath29 .",
    "2 shows clearly the contribution of the gh shift to the 2d group delay . as is seen ,",
    "the scattering component is symmetric about the center of the transmission gap ( tg ) ( @xmath30 ) due to the symmetry of @xmath31 about the center .",
    "contrarily , the gh component is asymmetric about the tg s center , which stems from the behavior of the quantum gh shift .",
    "the gh shift has the same trend as the classical shift ( @xmath32 with @xmath33 the refracted angle ) predicted by the snell s law @xcite , which is negative ( positive ) in the low ( high ) energy region ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . accordingly",
    ", through the intrinsic term in the phase shift ( @xmath34 ) , the gh shift not only quantitatively contributes a part of order of @xmath35 in the 2d group delay but also , qualitatively , results in the remarkable asymmetric feature of the 2d group delay .",
    "we now seek physical observable for the 2d group delay in graphene .",
    "the larmor precession of the electron spin in a magnetic field provides a clock for studying the electron dynamics @xcite . here",
    ", we calculate the transmission probability ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 in a geometry where the magnetic field is applied in the graphene plane @xcite .",
    "( note the 2d dwell time has the same definition as the 1d one . )",
    "an explicit equality between the dwell time and an average transmission probability @xmath38 is found in the weak - field limit : @xmath39 ( see , fig .",
    "@xmath40 is the larmor frequency , @xmath41 the gyromagnetic factor , @xmath42 the bohr magneton , and @xmath14 the magnetic field .",
    "the weakness of the magnetic field can be described by its reduced strength , @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the transmission probability for an electron incident with @xmath45-directed spin and transmitted with @xmath46-directed spin .",
    "this equation holds for _ all fermi energies and incident angles _ and can be interpreted physically in following .",
    "multiplying the right side by @xmath47 gives the expectation value of @xmath48 , which is just determined by the larmor frequency and the time the precession persists ( obviously , the dwell time rather than @xmath49 shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ) as the left side expressed .",
    "note @xmath50 implies an experimental observable , i.e. , a conductance @xmath51 , with the conductance quantum of @xmath52 accounting for a twofold valley degeneracy .",
    "thus , the above equality can be rewritten as @xmath53 which clearly indicates that the dwell times can be related to a spin precession experiment .",
    "we now try to relate the group delay to the conductance by obtaining the relation between it and the dwell time . due to the 2d feature of the tunneling and spinor nature of graphene ,",
    "the derivation for the relation is much more skillful and complex than the one for 1d case of normal fermions shown in ref .",
    "the detailed derivation can be found in the appendix , here we give the concise result for a rectangular potential barrier @xmath54 where @xmath55\\sin\\alpha / e\\cos^2\\alpha$ ] is a self - interference delay stemming from the interference of the incident and reflection wave functions @xcite .",
    "note this term has so far been widely believed to disappear @xcite , where the gh component was ignored and an improper variation method that is simply extended from ref .",
    "@xcite was taken .",
    "4 shows the group delay , dwell time , and self - interference delay in reduced form as a function of the fermi energy at a fixed incident angle , where @xmath56 is a reduction factor .",
    "the reduced self - interference delay ( @xmath57 ) achieves the maximum at the tg s center and oscillates around zero outside the gap .",
    "the self - interference delay itself is important only in the low energy region ( diverging as @xmath58 when @xmath59 ) , and disappears at ( anti)resonant tunneling since there is no interference in front of the barrier .",
    "accordingly , the group delay nearly coincides with the dwell time except within the low energy ranges or around the tg s center . the average self - interference delay , @xmath60 oscillates with @xmath7 and disappears at a relatively high fermi energy ( see the insert in fig .",
    "4 ) . therefore , eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) imply that , for any fermi energy compared with @xmath61 , the 2d group delay can now be directly observed by spin associated conductance difference in a spin precession experiment @xmath62 as is seen in fig . 5 ,",
    "the spin associated conductance difference which can be obtained by measuring @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see insert in fig .",
    "5 ) increases for weaker @xmath65 . at @xmath66 , it is already a rather good measurement of the 2d group delay for @xmath67 .",
    "thus far , we have provided a feasible and relatively easy approach for measuring group delay in graphene , which can be applied to other 2d ballistic electronic systems , such as normal semiconductors , bilayer and multilayer graphene , surface states of 3d topological insulators , and their heterojunctions .",
    "( superconductors will be an exception as superconducting states may be destroyed by the magnetic fields ) .",
    "since the experimental measurement is feasible , the group delay in ballistic electronic systems should be regarded as a relevant quantity .",
    "meanwhile , the scattering component is larger ( smaller ) than the expected value of the group delay when @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , a result of the gh shift of different signs",
    ". then a comparison between the observed value of the conductance difference ( right side of eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) and the theoretical prediction of the average group delay ( left side of eq . ( 5 ) ) can be utilized to probe the intrinsic effect of the gh shift .",
    "we now revisit the 2d hartman effect in graphene analytically .",
    "we find that the self - interference delay can be related to the difference in the expectation values of @xmath70 at the two outer or inner boundaries of the barrier , @xmath71 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath72 for @xmath73 @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the flux of incident particles , and @xmath77 is the intensity ( interference ) component of the stored probability . based on this equation and eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( note @xmath78 ) the group delay can be rewritten as @xmath79 for @xmath73 @xmath74 , where @xmath80 is a ratio of the kinetic energies inside and outside the barrier ( see the appendix ) . the probability density for the evanescent mode ( @xmath81 ) simply decays exponentially .",
    "taking the analytical expression of @xmath77 by the transfer matrix method , one can find in the limit @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "thus the dwell time , the group delay , and the self - interference delay are all saturated in this exponential limit : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87/v\\cos\\alpha$ ] .",
    "the analytical results obtained here clearly indicate that the 2d hartman effect does happen in graphene provided @xmath88 becomes imaginary under the barrier , which is the same condition for semiconductor - based structures with parabolic dispersions @xcite .",
    "this result is not only quantitatively different from ref .",
    "@xcite where only the scattering component was considered , but also essentially opposite to the dragomans conclusion that the hartman effect is absent in graphene as declaimed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we at last devote ourselves to the barrier - length dependent behavior of the proposed physical observable .",
    "since there are no transmission modes , the average group delay is also saturated with the barrier length at the dirac point ( @xmath89 ) ( see , insert of fig .",
    "this behavior and the saturation value can be directly detected by conductance measurements .",
    "moreover , the group delay is dominated by the scattering component , which can be well approximated by @xmath90 with @xmath91 . as can be seen in fig . 6 ,",
    "although the gh component dramatically increases as @xmath92 and finally dominates the group delay , it makes negligible contribution to the average group delay , since the transmission probability ( which can be well approximated by @xmath93 ) exponentially decreases with @xmath92 . in other word",
    ", the intrinsic effect of the gh shift should be probed deviating from the dirac point , which coincides with fig .",
    "5 . in view of eq . ( 5 ) , the saturation value is given by @xmath94 for our case , @xmath95 gives a value of about @xmath96 , which coincides well with the numerical result in fig .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the intrinsic contribution of the gh shift to the 2d group delay in graphene .",
    "more importantly , we have proposed a feasible and relatively easy approach for the observation of group delay ( and hence the intrinsic effect of the gh shift ) by conductance measurements in a weak - field spin precession experiment .",
    "we have also analytically revisited the 2d hartman effect , and investigated the barrier - length dependent behavior of the proposed observable .",
    "although quantitative results may vary for other systems which differ in electronic elementary excitations , the intrinsic effect of gh shift generally hold for any 2d ballistic electronic systems , and the proposed conductance difference provides a universal physical observable for 2d group delay in these systems ( except superconductors ) . besides , our results also imply that to construct a generalized wigner - smith time - delay matrix that is valid for 2d case and 3d case is an urgent issue in the condensed matter physics field .",
