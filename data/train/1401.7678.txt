    "frustrated quantum magnets can exhibit highly unconventional ground states , in which local moments are highly correlated but nevertheless evade a conventional ordering transition and remain strongly fluctuating down to zero temperature .",
    "these unusual states are commonly referred to as quantum spin liquids @xcite  despite their rather diverse physical properties ranging from gapped states with an emergent topological order to gapless states with an emergent spinon fermi surface .",
    "a common motif in the search for quantum spin liquids has been to look for quantum antiferromagnets on geometrically frustrated lattices , i.e. lattices where the elementary building blocks prohibit the formation of a conventional nel state .",
    "paradigmatic examples of geometric frustration include lattices formed by corner - sharing tetraedra such as the pyrochlore lattice , or by corner - sharing triangles such as the kagome lattice in two spatial dimensions and the hyperkagome lattice in three spatial dimensions .",
    "an alternative route to induce frustration in a quantum magnet is to look for systems , in which competing interactions can not be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "archetypal examples of such exchange frustration are given by the quantum compass models @xcite , in which the easy - axis of an anisotropic spin exchange strongly depends on the spatial orientation of the exchange path  a scenario which can prohibit even a ferromagnet on a bipartite lattice from undergoing a finite - temperature ordering transition .",
    "the best known example in this class of compass models is the kitaev model @xcite on the honeycomb lattice , in which the easy - axis of an ising - like spin exchange points along the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 directions for the three different bond types of the hexagonal lattice , which is captured by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where su(2 ) spins @xmath9 on sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected via a bond in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the kitaev model is quintessential in that it harbors three different types of quantum spin liquids  a gapped , @xmath13 topological spin liquid if one of the three exchange couplings is significantly larger than the couplings associated with the two other bond directions ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , and a gapless spin liquid in the vicinity of equal - strength exchange couplings ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "if applying an external magnetic field along the @xmath16-direction , the latter can be gapped out into a topological spin liquid with non - abelian vortex excitations .",
    "the kitaev model not only stands out for the unusual richness of its ground states , but the fact that it is one of the very few examples of an interacting spin model that can be rigorously solved .",
    "it should , however , be pointed out that the kitaev model has not only attracted the imagination of phenomenologically inclined theorists , but has also stirred some excitement in the materials oriented community after it has been pointed out that the significantly enhanced spin - orbit coupling in 5d transition metal oxides and in particular certain iridates can give rise to unconventional mott insulators where the local moment is a spin - orbit entangled @xmath3 moment @xcite . the orbital contribution to these moments results in a highly anisotropic , spatially oriented exchange @xcite , which can in fact mimic those of the kitaev model . in terms of actual materials the layered iridates na@xmath1iro@xmath2 and",

    "this structure , which has quickly been dubbed hyperhoneycomb lattice @xcite , keeps the trivalent vertex structure of the hexagonal lattice and thereby the essential feature allowing for an analytical solution of the kitaev model .",
    "in fact , the kitaev model on the hyperhoneycomb lattice had been identified and studied before by mandal and surendran @xcite who reported the occurrence of a gapless spin liquid with an emergent spinon fermi surface on a line in momentum space for approximately equal - strength interactions ( @xmath15 ) as well as the occurrence of a gapped topological spin liquid for anisotropic exchange strength @xcite .",

    "the presence of these symmetries is also the key distinction to the hyperhoneycomb lattice , another somewhat less symmetric three - dimensional trivalent lattice structure which has been revealed in the recent synthesis of @xmath0-li@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",

    "for instance , the loop operator of the loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : loops_numbered ] a ) is given by @xmath51 in both the honeycomb and hyperhoneycomb model , the two definitions of the loop operator , @xmath46 in and @xmath52 in , are identical .",

    "we define magnetic flux by the eigenvalue of : if @xmath46 has eigenvalue @xmath54 we say that there is a magnetic flux ( vortex ) penetrating the plaquette enclosed by @xmath45 , while an eigenvalue @xmath55 corresponds to no flux @xcite .",

    "a direct consequence of this linear dependence of three loops is that there is no full - flux sector in this model for which all loop operators have eigenvalue -1 .",
    "note that if we would have chosen the alternative definition of the loop operator in eq .",
    "then we would have concluded that there is no zero - flux sector in this model .",
    "this constraint can also be understood graphically .",
    "each loop defines an enclosed surface as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : volumes_hyperoctagon ] . in general",
    ", a product of loop operators is constrained if their respective surfaces form a closed ` volume ' .",
    "for the hyperoctagon lattice , note that the three surfaces corresponding to the respective loops indeed form a closed object though the encompassed volume actually vanishes .",
    "this situation should be contrasted to the three - dimensional hyperhoneycomb lattice , which for a complete and self - consistent presentation we discuss in appendix [ app : hyperhoneycomb ] . in the hyperhoneycomb lattice ,",
    "four loops of length ten encompass a closed volume as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : loops_hyperhoneycomb ] in the appendix and are thus linearly dependent . however , with an even number of linear dependent loops , the corresponding spin model allows for both a zero - flux and a full - flux sector , while in our case only one of the two sectors can exist .",
    "in order to gain a better insight into the physics underlying the different magnetic flux sectors , let us note that the elementary loops of length ten can be uniquely labeled by their midpoint @xmath62 . these midpoints form a ( deformed ) hyperkagome lattice .",
    "the constraint on the loop operator eigenvalues is then enforced on each of the triangles of the hyperkagome lattice : there are either zero or two loops per triangle that carry flux .",
    "we can thus count the number of independent configurations by noting that there are six midpoints ( = loops ) and four triangles ( = constraints ) per unit cell .",
    "thus , there are only @xmath63 loop eigenvalues per unit cell that can be chosen freely . as a result",
    "there are in total @xmath64 distinct flux sectors , where @xmath65 is the number of unit cells . in order to determine in which magnetic flux sector the ground state resides",
    ", we can not follow the same route as taken in two spatial dimensions and resort to lieb s theorem stating that the ground state always resides in the flux - free sector @xcite , but instead have to carefully consider the energetics of the different flux sectors / loops .",
    "for the great majority of points in parameter space , we numerically observe that creating or enlarging loops costs energy and as such the ground state lies in the flux - free sector also in three spatial dimensions .",
    "we therefore restrict our following discussion to the zero - flux sector .",
    "let us briefly consider the effective theory for the magnetic flux excitations arising from flipping a loop operator eigenvalue from @xmath55 to @xmath54 .",
    "we note that the midpoints of loops with loop operator eigenvalue @xmath54 form themselves closed loop configurations , which live again on the links of a hyperoctagon lattice  albeit with opposite chirality to the original one . due to the constraint ,",
    "only closed loop configurations are allowed , i.e. there are no magnetic monopoles in this @xmath66 theory .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the exact analytic solution of hamiltonian . in analogy to the two - dimensional kitaev model , such an analytical solution is possible by recasting the original spin degrees of freedom in terms of majorana fermions  a step that effectively reduces the interacting spin system to a free fermion problem , which is given by majorana fermions hopping in a static gauge field  @xcite .",
    "the fermion system can thus be diagonalized in a straight - forward way thereby also revealing the physics of the interacting spin model .    as first step ,",

    "the link operators commute among themselves as well as with the hamiltonian , which implies that we can fix the eigenvalues of all the link operators  i.e. choose a specific ` reference configuration '  and compute the spectrum of the resulting quadratic hamiltonian for any given @xmath76 sector .",

    "as such the zero - energy surfaces revealing themselves in the energy spectrum should in fact be thought of as majorana fermi surfaces .    as the phase transition to the gapped phase at @xmath106",
    "is approached , the relevant majorana band moves up in energy and at @xmath103 no longer crosses the zero - energy level , but merely touches @xmath107 in a single point with a quadratic dispersion .",
    "this scenario is in complete analogy to the phase transitions from the gapless to gapped majorana phases in both the honeycomb and hyperhoneycomb models .",
    "for conventional fermi liquids it is well appreciated that the fermi surface is susceptible to a variety of instabilities , the most notable of which is the formation of superconductivity .",
    "as such two questions immediately arise with regard to the majorana fermi surface in our hyperoctagon model  why is the majorana fermi surface stable in the first place and what are its possible instabilities ?",

    "we will then devote the remainder of this section to a discussion of possible instabilities of the majorana fermi surface focusing on instabilities arising from a reduction in lattice symmetries .      to discuss the stability of the majorana fermi surface",
    "let us first recall some basic facts about majorana fermions .",
    "an immediate consequence of the majorana condition @xmath108 in real space is that the ` creation operator ' @xmath109 in momentum space is defined by @xmath110 .",
    "the latter implies that for every energy state @xmath111 there is a ` particle - hole - conjugate ' partner at @xmath112 for which @xmath113    quite generally additional energy relations might exist , which depend on the underlying lattice geometry .",

    "it is important to note that for the hyperoctagon lattice @xmath115 generically does not vanish , because its elementary four - site unit cell is not consistent with a bipartite coloring of the lattice , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : kitaevmodel ] . for the specific example discussed in the previous section , @xmath118 . as a consequence , the zero - modes are in general all separated in momentum space . in order to see what effect this has on the stability of the gapless modes , we start by revising the situation for the honeycomb model following kitaev s original arguments and afterwards extend this discussion to the three - dimensional generalizations .      in the honeycomb model ,",
    "the majorana hamiltonian in momentum space is a @xmath119 matrix of the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a complex - valued function .",
    "the vanishing diagonal elements are in fact protected by time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are given by @xmath122 and zero - energy modes occur when @xmath123 .",
    "let us start by noting that the conditions @xmath124=0 $ ] and @xmath125=0 $ ] define ( several ) closed lines in momentum space , denoted in the following by @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the zeroes of @xmath121 are then , in general , given by the intersections of these lines . as a consequence , each pair of zero - modes at momentum @xmath128 comes with a partner , which in fact is located at @xmath112 .",
    "changing parameters deforms the line @xmath129 , which in turn moves the zeroes .",
    "the only way to gap out the system is by moving the lines @xmath129 sufficiently , such that they do not intersect any longer .",
    "the phase transition corresponds to a situation , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 merely touch .",
    "this structure of the eigenenergies readily confirms that _ separated pairs _ of zero - modes are stable in a finite parameter regime . on the other hand ,",
    "a similar line of reasoning shows that _ lines _ of zero - modes are not stable and can generically be gapped out completely by even an infinitesimal change in parameters .",
    "there is , however , a generic way to stabilize lines of gapless modes in two - dimensional generalizations of the kitaev model , which we will comment on below .",
    "we now extend the above discussion to the three - dimensional models , first considering the hyperhoneycomb model .",
    "in fact , the arguments of this section are valid for any three - dimensional kitaev - type model on a bipartite lattice , which is time - reversal invariant and where the unit cell is compatible with a bipartite coloring of the lattice . these assumptions are sufficient to determine the majorana hamiltonian to be a block matrix , where only the off - diagonal matrices are non - vanishing @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a complex matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are given by @xmath132 , where @xmath133 are the eigenvalues of @xmath131 .",

    "deforms the surfaces @xmath129 and , thus , the corresponding line of gapless modes , but can not induce a gap in the system . the latter can only be done by changing parameters sufficiently , such that the surfaces @xmath126 with @xmath127 do not intersect any longer , during which the line shrinks to a single point and vanishes .",
    "this shows that extended lines of gapless modes are topologically stable in these types of models",
    ". a similar line of reasoning substantiates that this does not apply to separated points as well as surfaces of gapless modes  both of which are not stable objects for these kinds of models and can only be accidental .",
    "the important distinction of the hyperoctagon model to the ones discussed above , is that the unit cell is not compatible with a bipartite coloring of the lattice .",
    "time - reversal invariance thus only requires the diagonal elements to vanish .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath136 which is a band hamiltonian with the additional property @xmath137 due to the majorana condition @xcite .",
    "zero - energy modes occur , when bands cross the @xmath107 line , which results in _ surfaces _ of gapless modes . in general",
    ", the incompatibility of the unit cell and the bipartite coloring of the lattice implies that @xmath138 . as a result , there is generically only a _",
    "single _ majorana zero - mode at a given momentum .",
    "the surfaces are thus trivially stable  changing parameters deforms the energy bands and thus the surfaces , but gapping a surface can only be done by either shrinking it to a point or by superimposing two such surfaces , in which case there are two gapless majorana modes at the same momentum .",
    "the latter is not stable and can always be gapped out by an infinitesimal change in parameters .",
    "likewise , one can verify that lines or separated points of gapless modes are not stable objects for these types of majorana hamiltonians .",
    "this line of reasoning also sheds light on how to obtain two - dimensional models with a stable fermi surface . in analogy to the case",
    "above , one needs to consider two - dimensional lattices , where the unit cell is not compatible with the bipartite coloring of the lattice .",
    "an example would be the square - octagon lattice studied in @xcite .",
    "considering various flux sectors , which do not enlarge the unit cell , indeed demonstrates that separated points of gapless modes are not stable , while closed lines are .      following the line of reasoning in the previous subsection points to a natural way to destabilize the fermi surface by enlarging the unit cell such that the two majorana fermi surfaces are mapped onto each other .",
    "this requirement is identical to identifying an enlarged unit cell that allows for a bipartite coloring of the lattice within that unit cell ( and thus @xmath115 vanishes ) and the disappearance of a lattice symmetry that prohibits the zero - energy modes from gapping out pairwise . below",
    "we will see that the majorana fermi surface is indeed no longer stable when enlarging the unit cell . however , the surface does not gap out completely , but instead reduces to a line of gapless modes  similar to the situation of the kitaev model on the hyperhoneycomb lattice",
    ". a closed line of gapless modes is , on the other hand , a topologically stable object for three - dimensional hamiltonians such as .",
    "changing parameters can only deform the line , but not gap it out .    in order to elucidate this ,",
    "let us consider an alternative covering of the hyperoctagon lattice with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 bonds , which is no longer invariant under @xmath139 translations .",
    "the enlarged unit cell thus allows for a bipartite coloring of the lattice .",
    "a specific realization of this is shown in figure [ fig : kitaev2 ] a ) .",

    "the model still fulfills that no vertex is connected to the same bond type twice and is , therefore , still exactly solvable with the methods used above .",
    "in contrast to the original hamiltonian , the new hamiltonian is no longer isotropic in the coupling constants , as can already be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : kitaev2 ] a )  the resulting kitaev model is only symmetric in @xmath145 , while the @xmath35 type bond stands out .",
    "thus , we expect qualitatively different behavior when @xmath146 compared to @xmath147 .",
    "let us first comment on the flux sectors on the model .",
    "it can be shown that the constraints on the loop operators are independent on the choice of the covering of the hyperoctagon lattice in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 bonds , even though the loop operators themselves change .",
    "in analogy to our original discussion in section [ sec : the_model ] we restrict ourselves to the vortex - free sector in the following and focus on the changes in the majorana sector induced by the alternation of the kitaev interactions .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the gapless modes in the majorana sector .",
    "the parameter region , in which gapless modes exist , is identical to the original model , i.e. determined by the triangular inequality .",
    "the transition lines to the gapped phases are parametrized by the equalities of eq . .",
    "in addition , the behavior of the model along the @xmath146 line in parameter space is identical to the original model .",
    "the latter can be understood by noting that the modified majorana hamiltonian at this line ` looks ' like the original one , albeit with an enlarged unit cell .",
    "in particular , on the line @xmath146 we still find a surface of gapless majorana modes when @xmath146 .",
    "however , the surface is not stable against departing from that parametrization condition .",
    "even an infinitesimal discrepancy in the coupling constants @xmath147 immediately opens up a gap on most of the surface and the two - dimensional majorana fermi surface collapses onto a line of gapless excitations , with linear dispersion in the normal directions .",
    "this line of gapless modes then remains stable throughout the rest of the gapless phase and contracts to a point on the transition lines to the gapped phases .",
    "the phase diagram for this model is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagramline ] .     a ) . along the line @xmath146",

    "panels b ) and c ) show the behavior of the gapless line , when b ) increasing @xmath81 and c ) decreasing @xmath81 , and setting @xmath102 . ]",
    "this behavior should be contrasted to what happens when increasing the unit cell in the @xmath144 direction , such that the enlarged unit cell is still incompatible with a bipartite coloring of the lattice .",
    "one possible way to achieve this is to switch the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bonds in every second unit cell along the @xmath150 direction , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kitaev2 ] b ) . note that this again breaks the isotropy of the original model in the coupling constants . similarly to the two previously discussed models , the region of parameter space with gapless excitations is again defined by the triangular inequality .",
    "for the same reasons as stated above , the model with the enlarged unit cell has the same properties as the original one along the @xmath146 line in parameter space .",
    "in contrast to the model with enlarged unit cell along the @xmath151 direction , discussed above , the surface remains stable , even when departing from this parametric condition .",
    "the behavior of the surface is similar to the original model . in particular",
    ", the dispersion around the gapless surface is linear in the normal direction , except at the phase transition to the gapped phases , where the surface shrinks to a single point with quadratic dispersion .",
    "the reason for the stability of the surfaces can again be tracked to their relative displacement in momentum space  a direct consequence that the unit cell is not compatible with the bipartite coloring of the lattice .",
    "to a certain extent one can take the perspective that our results for the kitaev model on the hyperoctagon lattice complete a family of analytically tractable spin liquids of growing complexity  starting from a two - dimensional dirac spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice over the intermediate step of a three - dimensional spin liquid with a line of gapless modes on the hyperhoneycomb lattice to finally a spin liquid with a full , two - dimensional surface of gapless modes for the hyperoctagon lattice . despite this ascent in complexity , we want to point out that all three instances share certain features such as rapidly decaying dynamical spin - spin correlation functions while differing in other aspects such as the nature of the phases induced by time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbations such as a magnetic field .",
    "starting with the similarities , it is interesting to observe that independent of the nature of the manifold of their gapless modes all three spin liquids exhibit dynamical two - spin correlation functions that are identically zero beyond nearest neighbor separation .",
    "this extremely rapid decrease was first observed in the context of the honeycomb model @xcite , but the very same arguments employed there also hold for the hyperhoneycomb and hyperoctagon lattices .",
    "another parallel arises when distorting the couplings in the kitaev model such that one of the coupling constants becomes dominant ( i.e. such that the triangular inequality does not hold any longer ) and the majorana sector is gapped out , see the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] for comparison . in these gapped phases",
    "the low - lying excitations are instead given by configurations , where some of the loop operators have negative eigenvalue .",
    "while for the two - dimensional honeycomb lattices two types of excitations can be discerned and identified with the point - like ( electric and magnetic ) excitations of a @xmath66 gauge theory , the effective low - energy theory for the three - dimensional lattice is somewhat more elaborate .",
    "mandal and surendran argued @xcite that there is only a single loop - like excitation in the gapped phases of the hyperhoneycomb model that exhibits non - trivial ( semionic ) braiding properties .",
    "likely , a variant of their argument with similar conclusions can be applied to the hyperoctagon model as well .",
    "a clear distinction between the three spin liquid phases arises when considering the effect of time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbations such as a magnetic field . for the honeycomb model",
    "such a perturbation is of utmost interest as the gapless majorana modes are protected by time - reversal and even an infinitesimal magnetic field ( applied along the 111-direction ) gaps out the spin liquid into a gapped topological phase with non - abelian vortex excitations . on a more technical level",
    "the reason for this drastic change induced by the magnetic field can be seen in terms of the symmetry class classification @xcite of the underlying free ( majorana ) fermion problem @xcite . in the absence of time - reversal symmetry breaking the model",
    "is in symmetry class bdi , while in the presence of a magnetic field the symmetry class changes to class d. the latter allows for a @xmath152 classification of topological phases in two spatial dimensions .",
    "indeed the two bands split by the magnetic field are characterized by chern numbers @xmath48 indicating the non - abelian nature of the gapped phase .    when considering a similar line of arguments for the three - dimensional models a different picture emerges .",
    "as noted earlier , the zero - energy modes of the hyperhoneycomb model are protected by time - reversal symmetry , while the ones of the hyperoctagon lattice are not .",
    "so while we expect the gapless phase of the hyperhoneycomb model to gap out immediately in the presence of a magnetic field , this is far from obvious for the zero - energy modes of the hyperoctagon model as the spectrum is robust against any two - fermion term that does not break translation symmetry .",
    "independent of whether a gap opens in the spectrum , it still holds that the symmetry class of the underlying free ( majorana ) fermion model changes from class bdi to class d in the presence of a time - reversal symmetry breaking term . however , in contrast to its two - dimensional counterpart symmetry class d does not harbor any topological phases in three dimensions @xcite . as a consequence , the three - dimensional systems can not be driven into a ( non - abelian ) topological phase by applying a magnetic field ( or any other time - reversal symmetry breaking perturbation ) .",
    "however , one might still be able to employ similar ideas to the ones used by ryu in ref .",
    "@xcite to stabilize a non - trivial topological phase by introducing additional ( orbital ) degrees of freedom such that the augmented model can be reformulated as a free fermion model in symmetry class diii .",
    "the latter does have a @xmath152 classification in three dimensions and , thus , allows for three dimensional analogs of the topological phase in the honeycomb model .",
    "finally , an interesting perspective emerges when recasting our results in the terminology conventionally used to characterize various spin liquid states @xcite . in this language ,",
    "we have discovered a spin liquid with a _ spinon fermi surface _ that covers an extensive two - dimensional manifold in momentum space .",
    "the quest to identify magnetic systems harboring such spinon fermi surfaces has typically inspired theorists to consider a slave - fermion approach where the fermion interacts with a _ fluctuating _",
    "@xmath153 gauge field  a situation that is notoriously hard to track analytically and",
    "any progress coming at the expense of compromises on the level of various decoupling / mean - field approaches .",
    "this situation should be contrasted to the current situation where we have stumbled upon a system with a spinon fermion surface with a much simpler and analytically exact description in terms of majorana fermions interacting with a _ static _ @xmath66 gauge field .",
    "however , it is important to note that this difference is not a mere conceptual one , but one that has direct implications for thermodynamic observables such as the specific heat coefficient @xmath154 . for a @xmath153 spin liquid",
    "the specific heat diverges as @xmath155 i.e. the specific heat coefficient @xmath156 _ diverges _ logarithmically at low temperatures @xcite . for our case of a spinon fermi surface emerging from majorana fermions interacting with a @xmath66 gauge field",
    "we find @xmath157 i.e. the specific heat coefficient @xmath75 goes to a _ constant _ at low temperatures .",
    "finally , this situation should be contrasted to the spin liquid with a fermi line , as it was found for the hyperhoneycomb lattice , where the specific heat grows as @xcite @xmath158 i.e. the specific heat coefficient @xmath75 _ vanishes _ in the limit of @xmath159 .",
    "remarkably enough , this implies that a simple thermodynamic experiment could immediately distinguish these three seemingly equally exotic spin liquids .",
    "returning to the perspective of the free ( majorana ) fermion system underlying our gapless spin liquid , there is one obvious bouquet of questions that we have not addressed in the manuscript at hand  namely the various pairing instabilities that the fermi surface of our system might exhibit",
    ". one might be particularly interested in asking what instabilities can be induced by additional interactions such as a heisenberg exchange argued to accompany the kitaev interactions in any microscopic description of iridate compounds @xcite .",

    "interaction terms of this type can indeed arise in a perturbative analysis of the heisenberg exchange .",
