    "for over two decades , there has been a great deal of interest in developing new methods for rapidly identifying and controlling linear time - invariant plants with large parametric uncertainties in a stable fashion .",
    "it is argued that such methods can also be used to adaptively control linear systems with time - varying parameters without losing stability .",
    "recently , second level adaptation was proposed in [ 1 ] , where the information generated by multiple adaptive models can be used at a second level to identify the plant rapidly .",
    "if the unknown plant parameter vector is of dimension @xmath1 , and belongs to a compact set , it is well known that @xmath3 points can be chosen in parameter space so that the unknown vector lies in their convex hull .",
    "this is the starting point of second level adaptation .",
    "if @xmath4 models are chosen with these parameters as their initial values , it was argued in [ 1 ] that the information derived from them could be used to derive an equivalent parameterization of the plant which converges much more rapidly .",
    "the basic ideas involved in the new approach can be summarized as follows , for use throughout the paper :    1 .",
    "the set @xmath5 in parameter space in which the unknown parameter @xmath6 can lie , is convex .",
    "parameters @xmath7 can be chosen such that @xmath6 lies in the convex hull of @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that constants @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 exits such that @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath3 adaptive models are used to identify @xmath6 at every instant , it can be shown using arguments of linearity and convexity that @xmath6 also lies in the convex hull of @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the estimates of @xmath6 generated by the adaptive models ) provided the initial states of the plant and models are identical .",
    "it is worth noting that when the state variables of the plant are accessible , the initial conditions of the states of the models can be chosen to be identical to that of the plant .",
    "4 .   if the @xmath3 models are non - adaptive but constant ( with @xmath16 constant ) , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the @xmath3 identification errors . 5 .   since @xmath13 in ( [ hypercubic ] ) and @xmath18 in ( [ basic reference model ] )",
    "are accessible , the conditions @xmath19 can be used to estimate the values of the constants @xmath20 . since by equation ( 1 ) , the vector @xmath21 can be considered as an alternative parameterization of the unknown plant , it can be used to estimate @xmath6 and hence the control input @xmath22 .",
    "the estimate @xmath23 of @xmath21 can be determined either algebraically , or by using a differential equation as described later .",
    "in this paper we will be interested in the following two principal questions :    1 .",
    "under what conditions would we expect second level adaptation to result in better performance than first level ( or conventional ) adaptation ?",
    "2 .   why is the overall system stable",
    "even when control is based on the estimate @xmath23 , rather than the true value of @xmath21 of the unknown parameter vector ? ( @xmath24 proof of stability )    in addition , we will also be interested in questions related to design and performance such as :    1 .",
    "can the performance and robustness of second level adaptation be improved by increasing the number of models ? if additional models are to be used , where should they be located for maximal marginal benefit ? 2 .",
    "are fixed models or adaptive models to be preferred ? can rational reasons be provided for combining such models ?    starting with a brief review of the theory of second level adaptation based on both adaptive and fixed models , we shall discuss the above questions in detail and compare both theoretically and using simulations , the new approach with conventional first level adaptive control .",
    "the paper will conclude with simulations studies of adaptation in rapidly time - varying environments and a discussion of future directions for research .",
    "the principal ideas involved in second level adaptation using multiple adaptive models and fixed models are discussed briefly in this section . these are used in all the discussions throughout the paper .",
    "we first consider the simplest case where the plant to be controlled adaptively is in companion form , and all the state variables of the plant are accessible .",
    "the plant is described by the state equations : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are in companion form and defined as @xmath29 , b=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0\\\\0\\\\0\\\\\\vdots \\\\1\\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ]    the parameters @xmath30 are unknown and it is assumed that the plant is unstable . if @xmath31 $ ] , we shall refer to @xmath6 as the unknown plant parameter vector .",
    "we further assume that @xmath6 belongs to a convex set @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is a hypercube in parameter space defined by @xmath33    the reference model @xmath34 is also in companion form and defined by the differential equation @xmath35 as in equation ( [ canonical matrix ] ) , the last row of @xmath36 is @xmath37 and is chosen by the designer to make @xmath36 stable . the reference input @xmath38 is uniformly bounded and specified .",
    "the problem of adaptive control is to choose the input @xmath39 in the presence of parameter uncertainty so that the output @xmath40 of the plant follows asymptotically the output @xmath41 of the reference model ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "direct and indirect control are two distinct methods for achieving the above objective .    : in this case , the input @xmath39 is chosen as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is adjusted adaptively . since it is known a prior that a constant gain vector @xmath45 exists such that @xmath46 , @xmath44 has to be adjusted such that @xmath47 . if the equations describing the plant and the reference model are respectively @xmath48 the input @xmath39 is chosen as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is the control error .",
    "if @xmath52 is a lyapunov function candidate , it follows that @xmath53 hence , the system is stable and @xmath54 and @xmath44 are bounded .",
    "further , since @xmath55 is bounded , it follows that @xmath56 and @xmath57 if the input @xmath38 is persistently exciting .    : in direct control , the feedback parameter @xmath44 is directly adjusted using the control error and system identification ( or parameter estimation ) is not involved .    : in contrast to direct control described earlier , in indirect control , the unknown parameter vector @xmath6 is estimated at every instant as @xmath58 and in turn used to control the system . to assure the stability of the estimator ,",
    "the following model is used : @xmath59x_{p}(t)+bu\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a stable matrix , @xmath36 and @xmath60 ( like @xmath27 ) are in companion form and the last rows of the two matrices are respectively @xmath37 and @xmath61 .",

    "however , it can be any stable matrix .",
    "it is chosen as in equation ( [ basic reference model ] ) to make the control problem simple .    defining @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 using standard arguments of adaptive control , the adaptive law @xmath66 follows readily .",
    "the adaptive law is seen to be very similar to that derived from direct control , except that identification rather than control error is used in ( [ basic adaptive law ] ) .",
    "note that the control error is not used in the adjustment of the control parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the parametric erorr @xmath63 tends to zero when the input @xmath38 is persistently exciting , and converges to a constant value ( if @xmath67 tends to zero ) when it is not . in both cases",
    ", the control error tends to zero as seen from equation ( [ identification error equation ] ) .",

    "a brief examination reveals that the latter result is also true even if the models are fixed ( @xmath24 @xmath16 are constant and not estimated online ) .",
    "hence once again , @xmath20 can be determined by observing the output error vector @xmath18 of the @xmath68 models .",

    "hence , for any input to the @xmath4 models , the entire matrix @xmath106 is known , and is independent of the actual plant output @xmath40 .",

    "as is well known , the analysis of the system becomes complicated when the errors are large .",
    "in particular , when the initial conditions @xmath144 and @xmath145 are large , the solution of the equations ( [ control error differential equation ] ) and ( [ adaptive parameter update ] ) is far from simple .",

    "however , very little can be concluded about the transient behavior of the system .",
    "hence , additional methods , as well as arguments , are needed to justify how satisfactory response can be achieved .    in the new approach , based on multiple models , and second level adaptation , scores significantly in such a case",
    ", since the differential equation describing the behavior of @xmath140 continues to be linear .",
    "further , the designer also has considerable prior knowledge of the matrix @xmath106 , which depends only upon the identification models which are known , rather than the plant which is unknown .",
    "this in turn , provides much greater control over the performance of second level adaptation .    to compare the performance of first level ( conventional ) adaptive control and second level adaptive control ,",

    "( [ fig2 ] ) demonstrates that the speed of convergence of second level adaptation is orders of magnitude faster than first level adaptation . while the former converges in 16 seconds , it is seen that adaptation of three first level models has barely commenced . in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , it is seen that the tracking error ( using multiple models ) converges in 3 seconds , but the convergence time for the first level is considerably longer .",
    ": thus far , the analysis has been that of the adaptive control of a time - invariant plant , where @xmath6 , the plant parameter vector is unknown but constant .",
    "we have discussed the advantage of using second level adaptation over conventional adaptive control when the region of uncertainty is large .",
    "in such a case , the nonlinear effects in the adaptive algorithm ( first level ) begin to play a major role in the convergence of the parameter estimate . in this section ,",

    "the behavior of adaptive systems with time - varying parameters has been the subject of the research for several decades .",
    "however , useful results are available only when @xmath6 has rapid variation with small amplitude or slow but large variations . since @xmath159 , @xmath160 . in other words , @xmath161 is a forcing function of the nonlinear error differential equation .",
    "this accounts for the difficulty encountered in analyzing adaptive systems with time - varying parameters .    :",
    "the simple equations ( 11a ) and ( 11b ) , which can be used to determine @xmath21 , were discussed assuming linearity and time - invariance of the error equations .",

    "the analysis is considerably more complex , but arguments can be provided as to why @xmath162 is still a valid approximation of the equation ( 11b ) . in the following analysis , we assume that equation @xmath162 is a valid approximation of the equation ( 11a ) . once again , we use @xmath23 , the solution of the differential equation @xmath163 to approximate the time varying @xmath155 . since @xmath106 depends only on the output of the fixed identification models , it is not affected by the time variations in the plant parameters . this",

    "second level adaptation is seen to result in significantly better response that first level adaptation .",
    "it was seen from the discussions in earlier sections that either fixed models or adaptive models can be used for identifying and controlling a plant .",
    "extensive simulation studies have shown that multiple adaptive models ( rather than multiple fixed models ) result in a smoother response .",
    "however , the convergence times are comparable in the two cases .",
    "if the plant parameter is not constant but time - varying , the approach using fixed models is found to be better , since in the long run , all adaptive models tend to converge to a single point in parameter space .",
    "this make the approach almost equivalent to conventional adaptive control .",
    "hence , depending on the application either fixed or adaptive models can be used in second level adaptation .",
    "the use of fixed and adaptive models for switching and tuning is a well investigated approach for adapting to large uncertainty .",
    "the experience gained from those studies are currently being used to determine how the two types of models can be combined for maximum effect in second level adaptation .",
    "the behavior of adaptive systems with different types of perturbations has been studied for decades under the title of `` robustness '' . in particular ,    * the effect of input output disturbance * tine variation in unknown parameters * the effect of unmodeled dynamics    on the performance of the adaptive system have to be studied in this context .",
    "we have already seen that second level adaptation performs significantly better than first level , both when the region of uncertainty is large and when the plant parameter varies rapidly with time .",
    "when the output of the plant is corrupted with noise , it is seen that the matrix @xmath106 is unaffected while the signal @xmath165 contains noise .",
    "this results in @xmath173 having zero mean value due to the noise and hence smaller error in the response of the adaptive system .",
    "hence , second level adaptation is found to be more robust than first level adaptation in two out of three cases of interest .",
    "the behavior of second level adaptation in the presence of unmodeled dynamics is currently being investigated .",
    "second level adaptation based on multiple identification models appears to have advantages over conventional or first level adaptive control in regard to every feature of interest to the designer .",
    "it is significantly faster with large uncertainties , and/or rapid time - variation of parameters , and more robust in the presence of disturbances .",
    "all the advantages are due to the fact that @xmath21 , which is an alternative parameterization of @xmath6 can be estimated using linear equations while @xmath174 is invariable determined by nonlinear equations , due to the importance of stability in adaptive systems .",
    "all the analysis carried out in the paper deals with the plant in companion form , whose state variables are accessible for measurement .",

    "<S> based on @xmath0 fixed or adaptive models of the plant , where @xmath1 is the dimension of the unknown parameter vector , an unknown parameter vector @xmath2 is estimated in the new approach , and in turn , is used to control the overall system . </S>",
    "<S> simulation studies were presented in [ 1 ] to demonstrate that the new method is significantly better than those that are currently in use .    in this paper , we undertake a more detailed examination of the theoretical and practical advantages claimed for the new method . in particular , the need for many models , the proof of stability , and the improvement in performance and robustness are explored in depth both theoretically and experimentally . </S>"
