    "recently two - neutron transfer processes have attracted renewed interests thanks to the opportunities of two - neutron transfer reaction experiments using the beams of radioactive neutron - rich isotopes@xcite . in the past a considerable number of experimental and theoretical studies of two - neutron transfer have been accumulated for stable nuclei@xcite .",
    "one of the central concepts established there is that the two - neutron transfer amplitude is influenced by collective excitation modes caused by the superfluidity or the pair correlation@xcite . in the case of the open - shell nuclei ,",
    "the strong two - neutron transfer transitions connecting the ground states emerge ; it is a nambu - goldstone mode related to the rotational symmetry with respect to the phase of the pair condensate , called the pairing rotation .",
    "the pairing vibration , which corresponds to a vibration of the pairing gap , is another collective mode producing a low - lying excited @xmath0 state , but the intensity of the associated pair transfer is significantly smaller than the pairing rotation .    when neutron - rich nuclei are concerned , the above conventional picture of the pairing collectivity may be modified .",
    "we can expect this because neutron - rich nuclei often accompany skin or halo , i.e. , low density distributions of weakly bound neutrons surrounding the nucleus , and also because the neutron pairing in neutron matter is predicted to be strong or close to the strong - coupling regime at low densities @xcite .",
    "the expected enhancement of the pair correlation may result in unusual properties in two - neutron transfers .",
    "dobaczewski et al.@xcite has pointed out the possibility that the two - neutron transfer associated with the pairing rotation may be enhanced in neutron - rich nuclei because of the surface enhanced pairing .",
    "influences of the surface enhancement on the pair vibrational two - neutron transfer populating excited @xmath0 states and the first @xmath5 states in neutron - rich sn isotopes are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "recent experiments of @xmath6 reaction on light - mass neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath7li @xcite and @xmath8he @xcite point to the importance of the pair correlation in these typical halo or skin nuclei .",
    "the giant pairing vibration in neutron - rich nuclei has also been discussed@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the pairing collective modes in heavy - mass neutron - rich nuclei in order to explore new features in the pairing rotation , the pairing vibration , and the associated two - neutron transfer amplitudes .",
    "we focus on excitation modes with monopole multipolarity ( @xmath9 ) , for which the pairing collectivity is expected most strongly . as a target of the analysis , we choose the sn isotopic chain ranging from the proton - rich side @xmath10sn ( @xmath11 ) to very neutron - rich isotopes with @xmath12 beyond the @xmath1 magic number ( @xmath13sn ) .",
    "our theoretical tool is the hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field model using the skyrme energy density functional and the continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation , and it is the same as adopted in ref.@xcite . a similar approach is made in khan et al.@xcite , where the @xmath9 pairing vibration in neutron - rich sn isotopes is also studied .",
    "compared with ref.@xcite , we perform more systematic and detailed analyses , which eventually bring us a new finding and some differences . among all , the present analysis predicts a novel type of the pairing vibration that emerges in @xmath14sn .",
    "we describe the neutron pair correlation by means of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean - field theory@xcite and the continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa)@xcite . we assume the spherical symmetry of the mean - fields and densities associated with the ground states of the subshell - closed sn isotopes .",
    "the model adopted in the present study is the same as that in ref.@xcite .",
    "the starting point of the model is the energy density functional , which we construct from the skyrme interaction with the parameter set sly4@xcite , and the density - dependent delta interaction ( dddi ) adopted as an effective pairing force@xcite .",
    "the dddi is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the pairing interaction strength and is a function of the neutron and proton densities .",
    "we adopt the following form @xmath17 with the parameters @xmath18 mev @xmath19 , @xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 @xcite . here",
    "the parameter @xmath24 representing the strength in the free space is chosen to reproduce the scattering length @xmath25 fm of the bare @xmath26-interaction in the @xmath27 channel , and @xmath28 is to fit the density - dependent bcs pairing gap of neutron matter . the parameter @xmath29 is adjusted to reproduce the experimental pair gap in @xmath30sn .",
    "we call this parameter set dddi - bare as it is motivated by the bare nuclear force",

    "the excited states are described by means of the qrpa formulated in the coordinate space representation and on the basis of the self - consistent hfb solution .",
    "the residual interactions to be used in the qrpa are derived from the skyrme energy density functional and the dddi , but the landau - migdal approximation is employed for the residual interaction in the particle - hole channel .",
    "we impose the outgoing - wave boundary condition on the continuum quasiparticle states as described in ref.@xcite in the case of the isotopes with @xmath37 while the box boundary condition is adopted@xcite for @xmath38 where the neutron fermi energy is deeper than @xmath39 mev . in the qrpa response functions ,",

    ", the maximum values of the amplitude around the nuclear surface @xmath85 fm are approximately the same , but because of the large spatial extension of the transition density , the pair transfer strength in @xmath86sn is larger by a factor of @xmath87 2 ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the spatial extension of the pair transition density to develop suddenly beyond @xmath1 and @xmath64 can be ascribed to the shell gap at @xmath1 and properties of the neutron single - particle states .",
    "we here note that the transition density of the pair rotational mode , i.e. , the pair density @xmath88 is written as a coherent sum of contributions of quasiparticle states , and the quasiparticle states with lower excitation energy ( i.e. , those originating from orbits close to the fermi energy ) have larger contributions .",

    "since the binding energy of @xmath90 is rather small , the tail of its wave function extends to outside , leading to the long tail in the pair transition density . when the neutron number exceeds @xmath64",

    "note that the three interactions are designed to give approximately the same values of the average neutron pair gap @xmath160 ( cf .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) . comparing the three interactions",
    ", we can examine effects of different density - dependences of the dddi while keeping approximately the same average pair gap .",
    "the influence of the density dependence on the pair - addition and -removal strengths @xmath62 of the ground - state transition is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "although the influence is not significant for @xmath161 , we see some sensitivity ( but not very strong one ) to the density dependence for neutron - rich isotopes with @xmath143 .    concerning the pair vibrational modes , in contrast , the anomalous pairing vibration in @xmath144 has significant sensitivity to the density - dependence of the effective pairing interactions . as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) the pair - addition strength function @xmath99 in @xmath102sn calculated with the three different dddi s .",
    "it is noticed that the basic structure of the strength function is the same , and the anomalous pair vibrational mode commonly exists at around @xmath162 mev .",
    "more importantly it is seen that the height of the pair vibrational peak depends strongly on the different pairing interaction by about a factor of 1.5 .",
    "the difference is larger than that found in the ground - state transition .",
    "the same effect is seen commonly at @xmath163 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of the density - dependence on the pair - addition vibrational in the isotopes @xmath38 mode is small .",
    "we can understand the influence of the density - dependence on the anomalous pair vibrational mode in terms of the transition density @xmath116 , whose dependence on the pair interactions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) .",
    "it is seen in this figure that the amplitude @xmath116 in the external region @xmath164 outside the surface shows the same trend as in the pair - addition strength @xmath126 ; the dddi - bare @xmath165 mix @xmath165 volume pairing interactions .",
    "we can then relate this trend to the features of density - dependent interaction strength @xmath166 , which is , in the external region , the largest for the dddi - bare and the smallest for the volume pairing , reflecting the density - dependent interaction strength at low densities .",
    "( @xmath167 mev @xmath19 and see also fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since the anomalous pair vibrational mode at @xmath144 has the transition density extending far outside the surface , the large difference in the interaction strength @xmath166 in the exterior is effective to this mode .",
    "however , for the usual pair vibrational modes whose transition density does not reach very far , the sensitivity becomes small .",
    "finally we remark on related works@xcite discussing the sensitivity to the density - dependence of the effective pairing interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pair - transfer strengths and the transition density of the pair vibrational modes are analyzed for @xmath168sn and @xmath169sn by using the skyrme - hfb + qrpa model , which is similar to the model adopted here . in the case of @xmath169sn ,",
    "the low - lying pair vibrational mode around @xmath170 mev emerges in two of their calculations ( the @xmath171 and 0.35 cases of ref.@xcite ) , in qualitative agreement with our results .",
    "the shape of the pair - addition transition density @xmath116 is also similar as seen from the comparison of the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) of the present paper and fig.8 of ref.@xcite . on the other hand , in another calculation adopting the dddi with the strongest density dependence ( the @xmath172 case in ref.@xcite ) , the low - lying pair vibrational mode is fragmented into three peaks ( cf .",
    "fig.7 of ref.@xcite ) , suggesting a complex sensitivity to the pairing interactions .",
    "we note that the interaction strength @xmath173 mev@xmath19 chosen in the @xmath172 case is too large since it leads to the positive scattering length , implying unphysical existence of a bound state for the @xmath42 neutron pair . in the present investigation , on the contrary , we constrain the upper limit of @xmath174 as @xmath175 mev @xmath19 by the scattering length @xmath25 mev of the @xmath27 channel of the bare nuclear force . for our pairing interactions determined under this constraint ,",
    "the anomalous pair vibrational mode stably emerges as a single - peak around @xmath176 mev in @xmath4sn .",
    "it is discussed in ref.@xcite that the quadrupole pair - addition transfer populating the first @xmath5 states in @xmath102sn and heavier isotopes is sensitive to the density - dependence of the pairing interaction . in that case",
    "the ratio of the pair - addition strengths between the volume pairing and the dddi - bare amounts to approximately a factor of two , which is slightly larger than the sensitivity ( a factor of @xmath177 ) of the pair vibrational mode in @xmath4sn .",
    "the origin of the different sensitivity is not clear at present , but it may be related to the fact that the monopole pair transition density has larger amplitude also in the internal region of the nucleus than that of the quadrupole mode .",
    "we have investigated microscopically monopole two - neutron transfer modes in heavy - mass superfluid nuclei using the skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean - field model and the continuum quasiparticle random phase approximation .",
    "emphases have been put on the pair vibrational modes populating low - lying collective @xmath0 states and on the pair rotational transitions connecting the ground states of the neighboring @xmath178 isotopes .",
    "we have performed systematic numerical analysis for the even - even sn isotopes ranging from @xmath179 to @xmath146 , and found the following new features of the two - neutron transfer modes emerging in neutron - rich sn isotopes beyond the @xmath1 shell closure ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the calculation predicts a novel type of pair vibrational mode in the isotopes @xmath4sn .",
    "it is a monopole vibrational mode characterized by intense transition from the ground state to a low - lying @xmath0 state in the neighboring @xmath46 isotope via the two - neutron addition transfer .",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 states are predicted to emerge near the threshold energy of the one - neutron separation , and to form a narrow resonance in case when it is located above the separation energy .",
    "an anomalous feature of this pair vibrational mode and a marked difference from the pairing vibration in nuclei near the stability line is that the pair transition density exhibits a large amplitude in the region outer than the surface , and also a long tail extending up to @xmath134 fm .",
    "we expect that the difference may manifest itself in reaction observables such as the cross section of the @xmath180 reaction although quantitative analysis remains for future investigations . as a microscopic origin of the anomalous pair vibrational mode , the weakly bound or resonant @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbits",
    "are suggested to play key roles .    in very neutron - rich isotopes with @xmath65 ( @xmath181 ) ,",
    "enhancement of the two - neutron transfer strength is predicted for the transitions between the ground states .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the spatially extended pair field originating from the weak binding of neutrons .",
    "particularly , occupation of the weakly bound @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbits gives the sudden increase in the strength for @xmath65 . in this perspective , the anomalous pair vibrational mode in @xmath4sn can be linked to the strong ground - state transfer in @xmath65 , and it can be regarded as a precursor of the enhanced pair transfer which emerges in weakly bound neutron - rich nuclei close to the drip - line .    this work was supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( nos .",
