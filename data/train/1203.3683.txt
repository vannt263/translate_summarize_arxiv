    "long - range order and excitation dynamics in the orbital degenerate correlated electron systems are one of the recent attractive themes in condensed matter physics .  @xcite orbital degree of freedom represents a spatially anisotropy of the electronic wave function . in molecules , orbital degeneracy is usually lifted by coupling with lattice , i.e. the jahn - teller effect .",
    "in contrast , in crystal lattices , there are some equivalent bonds around a transition - metal ion .",
    "when an orbital is directed along one of the equivalent bonds , anisotropy in the bond energies comes out . in this sense",
    ", all bond energies on the equivalent bonds are not minimized simultaneously .",
    "this is regarded as a kind of frustration effect termed `` orbital frustration '' .",
    "@xcite this characteristic in the orbital degenerate systems provides a wide variety of exotic phenomena such as order by disorder phenomena ,  @xcite orbital liquid state  @xcite and so on .",
    "one of the well - studied orbital models is the kugel - khomskii model .",
    "@xcite this is applied to orbitally degenerate mott insulators , where the orbital degree of freedom in a transition - metal ion is described by the pseudo - spin ( ps ) operator .",
    "the intersite interactions between the nearest neighbor ions are represented by products of the heisenberg - type interaction between spins and the orbital interaction . in the orbital part ,",
    "the interaction between the pseudo - spins explicitly depends on the bond direction .",
    "another well studied orbital model is the orbital compass model where the orbital degree of freedom is only taken into account .",
    "a general expression of the orbital compass model is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ps operator for the doubly - degenerate orbital degree of freedom with an amplitude of @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a unit vector along the bond direction @xmath6 , and @xmath7 indicates the nearest neighboring ( nn ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites along @xmath6 .",
    "this model has some analogy to the dipole - dipole interaction and shows the same characteristics with the orbital part in the kugel - kohmskii model ; the interactions explicitly depend on a bond direction .",
    "this model has been studied from broad view points ; quantum phase transition ,  @xcite topological quantum order  @xcite , hidden dimer order ,  @xcite and protected qubit  @xcite are examined on a square - lattice compass model , and a kind of compass model is proposed as an appropriate model for transition - metal oxides with a strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite    transition - metal ions with orbital degree of freedom sometime consist geometrically frustrated lattices , such as triangle and spinel crystals .",
    "interplay of geometrical frustration and spin - orbital entanglement often give rise to novel states of matter , such as spin - orbital molecules in alv@xmath10o@xmath11 ,  @xcite a cooperative release of frustration proposed in znv@xmath10o@xmath11 ,  @xcite and a resonating valence bond state predicted in linio@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite even without spin - orbital entanglement , ground state and excitation dynamics in orbital degenerate system with geometrically frustrated lattice are non - trivial because of the orbital anisotropy and frustration characteristics .",
    "the recent neutron scattering experiments suggest an excitation from spin - orbital molecules in geco@xmath10o@xmath11,@xcite where effective total angular moments might be described by the orbital compass model .    in this paper , the orbital compass model on one of the geometrically frustrated lattices ,",
    "i.e. a checkerboard lattice , is studied .",
    "competitions arise from an ising interaction for the @xmath0 component of ps , @xmath12 , along the horizontal and vertical directions on a lattice and an ising interaction for @xmath13 along the diagonal directions .",
    "phase diagrams in classical and quantum models , where ps operators are regarded as classical vectors and quantum operators , respectively , are obtained by several analytical and numerical methods .",
    "it is shown that , at a fully frustrated point , where a number of classical ps configurations are degenerate , two - dimensional staggered @xmath12 ordered state is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations . because of the bond depend ising interactions , a tricritical point for the two - dimensional staggered @xmath12 order appears .",
    "a one - dimensional characteristic excitation in this ordered state is remarkable near the phase boundary .",
