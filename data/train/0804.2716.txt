    "time - distance helioseismology is a powerful diagnostic tool used in local helioseismology to probe the subsurface structure and dynamics of the solar interior , in particular in and around solar active regions .",
    "to date however , results obtained by time - distance helioseismology have not directly accounted for the effects of the magnetic field on the wave - speed in travel - time perturbation maps , forward modelling or inversions , but have indirectly included magnetic effects only through their influence on the acoustic properties of the medium ( _ e.g. _ the sound speed ) .",
    "standard forward - modelling is based on a number of assumptions including , but not limited to , fermat s principle and the ray approximation ( _ e.g. _ ; ; ) , the fresnel - zone approximation ( _ e.g. _ ; ) and the born approximation ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "these models do not include any provision for surface effects .",
    "in fact , no standard local - helioseismic method includes provisions for contributions from near - surface magnetic fields .",
    "recent work in sunspot seismology has pointed to the significant influence of near - surface magnetic fields and possible contamination due to their effects in helioseismic inversions for sound speed beneath sunspots @xcite . prior to this , a number of other very important results have highlighted the complications of interpreting helioseismic observations ( in particular , the interaction of @xmath0 modes ) in the near - surface regions of sunspots ( see _ e.g. _ ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "the key issues are _ i _ ) how to successfully model the effects of wave - speed inhomogeneities thought to be produced by the magnetic field in solar active regions , _ ii _ ) how to isolate such effects from those thought to be associated with temperature , flow perturbations , and other observational constraints and effects , and finally _ iii _ ) how will inferences made about subsurface structure change as a result of incorporating these effects into the modelling process ?",
    "efforts to address these issues both observationally and computationally have been largely unsuccessful , mainly because of a general lack of understanding of the process involved .",
    "but there is some light at the end of the tunnel , as there are currently under development a number of robust magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations modelling helioseismic data and wave propagation that may aid our understanding considerably in the near future ( _ e.g. _ ; ) . in this work",
    ", we shall attempt to address some of these outstanding issues by using helioseismic ray theory to perform forward modelling of helioseismic rays in a simulated sunspot atmosphere with the aim of modelling the magneto - acoustic ray propagation and analysing the resulting artificial ray travel - time perturbations that will directly account for wave - speed variations produced by the magnetic field .",
    "we shall also address the problem of trying to isolate and analyze the thermal contributions to the observed travel - time perturbations using our simulations .",
    "the axisymmetric sunspot model chosen for our analysis consists of a non - potential , untwisted , magnetohydrostatic sunspot model constrained to fit observed surface magnetic field profiles .",
    "the surface field is therefore quite realistic , which is important because there is evidence @xcite that magnetic effects on helioseismology are dominated by the top mm .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the external atmosphere , ray - path simulations and computational grid remain identical to those described previously .",
    "the only difference is the resulting thermal travel - time perturbations ( @xmath1 ) which would then be purely a result of what can be referred to as `` thermal variations '' along the ray path .",
    "one can then compare the resulting perturbation profiles to those obtained when the magnetic field is included in the simulations ( _ i.e. _ figure  [ fig : bindt ] ) to better understand the role of the thermal contributions to the observed @xmath2 profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : bindt0 ] shows the resulting bins of the thermal component of @xmath1 .    in general ,",
    "the resulting @xmath1 profiles are relatively smooth and all bins clearly show exclusively positive travel - time perturbations ( compared to exclusively negative travel - time perturbations observed in figure  [ fig : bindt ] ) , this implies that rays are travelling considerably slower than in the model s atmosphere  a clear contrast with simulations where the magnetic field is present .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 is also decreasing with increasing radius for the smaller bins ( @xmath3 ) and _ vice versa _ for the larger bins ( @xmath4 ) , a similar behaviour to what is observed in figure  [ fig : bindt ] .",
    "however , when considering the magnitude of the perturbations between figures  [ fig : bindt ] and [ fig : bindt0 ] , it is clear that thermal perturbations appear to be much smaller for a majority of the bins  in fact up to 400% smaller for some frequencies when comparing the perturbations in the near - surface regions @xmath5 .",
    "the magnitude of the perturbations become much more comparable when looking at the larger bins ( @xmath6 onwards ) , and from @xmath7 onwards @xmath1 becomes ever slightly larger than the ones we see in figure  [ fig : bindt ] for the same bins .",
    "frequency dependence of @xmath1 is also evident , but only clearly discernible for the first six bins ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "whether it be through direct observations , forward modelling , or inversions , in order to be able to confidently interpret helioseismic observations and inferences made in regions of strong magnetic field , the actual physical effects of near - surface magnetic fields on ray propagation must be better understood and taken into account when analyzing or modelling active region sub - photospheres .",
    "our approach here is akin to forward modelling of rays , but in a simulated sunspot atmosphere based on ivm surface magnetic - field profiles with a peak field strength of 3  kg and an external field - free model s atmosphere used as the background or unperturbed medium .",
    "the main aim of these simulations was to isolate and understand the effects of the wave - speed inhomogeneities produced by the magnetic field from those thought to be produced from thermal or flow perturbations .",
    "the magneto - acoustic rays were propagated across the sunspot radius for a range of depths to produce a skip distance geometry similar to centre - to - annulus cross - covariances used in time - distance helioseismology .",
    "the perturbations from the model s atmosphere were calculated for each radial grid position and range of frequencies ( @xmath9  mhz ) , then binned into 11 different skip - distance geometries of increasing size . a separate , yet similar , set of simulations",
    "was then produced to isolate the role played by thermal variations inside the sunspot atmosphere on the ray skip - distance and travel - time perturbation profiles .",
    "this was achieved by having the magnetic field switched off in the sunspot model , thus essentially maintaining a modified sound - speed structure , but with no calculations of the alfvn speed .",
    "these _ artificial _ skip - distance and travel - time perturbation profiles , which directly account for the effects near - surface magnetic fields and thermal variations separately , have provided us with a number of very distinct and interesting observations :    1 .",
    "the sunspot magnetic field has a clear and distinct `` dual effect '' on helioseismic rays  increasing their skip distances , while at the same time , shortening their travel time ( compared to similar rays in a model s atmosphere ) .",
    "higher frequency rays propagated within the magnetic field also tend to undergo a more substantial speed up than their non - magnetic counterparts .",
    "2 .   there is a clear and significant frequency dependence of both ray skip - distance and travel - time perturbations across the simulated sunspot atmosphere .",
    "this frequency dependence of perturbations was prevalent for all skip - distance bins , but particularly so for shallow rays , which sample the near - surface layers of the sunspot .",
    "3 .   the negative sign of travel - time shifts , along with the general pattern and magnitude of these perturbations ( _ i.e. _ tending to increase with increasing magnetic - field strength and inclination ) points to more evidence of the significant role played by the sunspot magnetic field .",
    "rays with shorter skip distances were seen to experience greater perturbations as a result of spending a considerable proportion of their journey within the confines of the magnetic field .",
    "4 .   with the magnetic field switched off ,",
    "the simulated travel - time perturbation profiles changed sign for all bins ( _ i.e. _ only positive perturbations were observed across the sunspot radius , meaning that rays in the thermal model are actually slower than their model s counterparts ) , and the magnitude of these perturbations appeared to be significantly smaller in magnitude ( @xmath10@xmath11% at times ) than when the magnetic field is included in the model .",
    "this was particularly evident for the bins that sample rays in the near - surface layers , whereas bins of larger skip distances produce slightly larger perturbations than the magnetic model .",
    "frequency dependence of travel - time perturbations were also observed , but only for half of the bins .",
    "a majority of bins sampling larger skip distances did not exhibit this behaviour .",
    "these observation as a whole tend to suggest that active - region magnetic fields play a direct and significant role in sunspot seismology , and it is the interaction of the near - surface magnetic field with solar oscillations , rather than purely thermal ( or sound - speed ) perturbations , that is the major cause of observed travel - time perturbations in sunspots .",
    "( we note here that we are only commenting on the interpretation of time - distance results in terms of _ thermal / sound - speed _ perturbations , and not , for example , in terms of _ wave - speed _ perturbations ) .",
    "the frequency dependence of these perturbations is one of the strongest indications that the magnetic field is a significant contributor to the travel - time shifts . when isolating the thermal component of @xmath12 we did observe some frequency dependence in a limited number of bins / skip distance geometries , certainly not to the extent that we saw when",
    "the magnetic field was included .",
    "of course in the absence of any perturbations , rays propagated at different frequencies will naturally have slightly different upper turning points , this could certainly explain a part of a frequency dependence , but this effect combined with the ( negative ) sign and magnitude of the simulated @xmath12 profiles , along with the relatively small ( positive ) thermal component extracted from the perturbations , makes it very difficult for one to argue that what we are seeing in these travel - time perturbation profiles is a result of a sub - surface flow or sound - speed perturbation , as has been traditionally interpreted in time - distance literature .",
    "instead , these observations indicate that strong near - surface magnetic fields may be seriously altering the magnitude and lateral extent of sound - speed inversions made by time - distance helioseismology .",
    "this is because standard time - distance observations ( _ e.g. _ , see section 4.2 ) show @xmath2 maps derived from the averaged cross - correlations shifting from positive values for the first couple of bins ( usually @xmath13 ) , to negative ones for the remainder of the bins .",
    "traditionally , positive perturbations result in regions of decreased sound speed in inversions , while negative perturbations result in regions of enhanced sound speed .",
    "but we have clearly seen from our forward modelling that the inclusion of the magnetic field in the near surface layers consistently results in negative values for all bins of @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that any inversion of time - distance data that does not account for surface magnetic field effects will be significantly contaminated in the shallower layers of the sunspot ( _ i.e. _ down to a depth of a few mm below the surface ) , in strong agreement with the conclusions of .",
    "hence it is almost certain from these simulations that the two - structure sunspot sound speed profile , _",
    "i.e. _ region of decreased sound speed immediately below the sunspot ( corresponding to positive @xmath2 ) , is most likely an artifact due to surface effects , instead of thermal perturbations .",
    "deeper sound speed profiles do not appear to be affected as much , given the sign and magnitude of the simulated @xmath2 for the larger bins are comparable to actual time - distance calculations , as expected , given the flux tube becomes gas - pressure dominated at such depths .",
    "of course , we must bear in mind that some of our assumptions outlined earlier ( _ e.g. _ 2d treatment of rays , our choice of ray cutoff height in the atmosphere , the fact that we are not directly accounting for mode conversion , even the form of the surface magnetic field and background model in general _ etc . _ ) , can certainly alter our results quantitatively in one manner or another . indeed it would certainly be interesting and worthwhile to conduct a full 3d simulation ( _ i.e _ vary the shooting angle @xmath14 around the sunspot ) and also test the ray propagation code with other sunspot and quiet - sun models in the future .",
    "but in any case , it would be surprising , given the self - consistency of our current results , if our qualitative conclusions were changed as a result .",
    "the authors are very grateful to hannah schunker for providing the ivm observations of ar 9026 , and also to sbastien couvidat for providing us with the travel - time maps of ar 8243 .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for useful comments that helped improve this paper ."
