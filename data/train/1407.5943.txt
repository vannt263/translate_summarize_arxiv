    "in the modeling of phase transitions it is often of interest to consider surface - energy - driven motion of interfaces .",
    "if the surface energy is anisotropic this leads to motion by weighted mean curvature ( see angenent and gurtin @xcite ) . some materials have `` crystalline '' energies .",
    "the idea of taking a crystalline approximation of a convex surface - energy leads naturally to a numerical scheme for determining motion by weighted curvature . for a detailed explanation as well as for the physical and mathematical context of this work the reader is referred to the introduction and appendix of @xcite .",
    "( familiarity with the theory of surface - energy - driven motion of phase boundaries is _ not _ assumed either in this work or in @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of taking a crystalline approximation to the surface - energy has been studied in the static case by sullivan in @xcite to find an area minimizing oriented hypersurface that spans a given boundary in space . the first attempt to study",
    "this idea in the dynamic context was @xcite , where we examined the case in which the interface is the graph of a function of one variable .",
    "the main result of @xcite was the convergence of a certain numerical scheme for a quasilinear parabolic differential equation with constant dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we proved convergence in @xmath0 with a specified rate .",
    "our method was somewhat similar to the convergence analysis for a galerkin approximation .",
    "here we study the crystalline approximation of motion by weighted curvature for smooth simple closed convex curves . for motion by weighted curvature",
    "the normal velocity of the curve is its weighted curvature ; the weighted curvature @xmath1 is @xmath2 if @xmath3 ( the interfacial energy ) is a smooth function which depends only on the angle between the normal to the curve and a fixed axis and @xmath4 is the curvature .",
    "we assume throughout that both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are positive functions .",
    "we approximate the interface by a polygon with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) sides moving by weighted curvature ( as defined below ) .",
    "all the interior angles of the polygon are equal and the sides of the polygon have fixed directions : the interior normal to the @xmath8th side is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , in a fixed coordinate system .",
    "it is standard to parametrize a convex curve by the angle @xmath11 between its normal and a fixed coordinate axis ( here @xmath11 is the angle between the exterior normal and the @xmath12-axis ) .",
    "using this parametrization the evolution equation for the weighted curvature of the interface is @xmath13 ( see eq .",
    "( 2.23 ) of angenent and gurtin  @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution equation for the weighted curvature @xmath14 of the @xmath8th side of the polygon turns out to be @xmath15^{-1 }                    \\left [ \\wi^2 \\wsecdrv + \\wic\\right ] \\ ] ] ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "to prove convergence of the crystalline approximation we shall derive the discrete analogue of estimates due to gage and hamilton  @xcite for the curvature and then use standard arguments to estimate @xmath17 .",
    "this will enable us to estimate the distance between the curve and the polygon .",
    "we mention that if the energy is isotropic , the initial curve is a circle , and the initial polygon is regular and circumscribed to the initial circle then the polygon remains regular and circumscribed to the circle as they collapse to a point . for other computational examples",
    "we refer the reader to roosen and taylor  @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper  is as follows : in section  2 we set up the problem and give estimates for the weighted curvature ; then in section  3 we prove the convergence of the crystalline algorithm for motion by weighted curvature .    in this paper",
    "we consider only convex curves in the plane",
    ". a natural next step would be to consider general ( i.e.  nonconvex ) simple closed curves .",
    "the paper by grayson  @xcite might be relevant because it generalizes the results of  @xcite for convex curves to general embedded plane curves .",
    "consider a smooth simple closed curve in the plane .",
    "we say that the curve is moving by weighted curvature when its normal velocity equals its weighted curvature : v(,t )  =  ( , t )   [ f ( ) + f^ ( ) ]  ( , t ) [ vek ] as in eq .",

    "we are interested in studying convergence of an approximation scheme for this equation when the curve is convex . in this scheme",
    "we substitute the curve by a convex polygon with @xmath6 sides , @xmath20 .",
    "the angle between two adjacent sides of the polygon is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is fixed , @xmath23 .",
    "the interior normals can be written @xmath24 in a coordinate system that will henceforth remain fixed .",
    "we take @xmath11 to be the angle between the exterior normal and the @xmath12-axis . whenever we refer to `` sides '' we mean the sides of this polygon .",
    "the @xmath8th side is the one with interior normal @xmath25 and joins the @xmath8th vertex with the @xmath26th one .",

    "each side has zero curvature , of course , if curvature is defined in the standard way , namely the rate of change with respect to arc length of the angle between the tangent and a fixed axis ; in this standard sense the curvature is not defined at the vertices of the polygon .",
    "however , curvature can alternatively be defined as the negative of the gradient of arclength ; weighted curvature is the negative of the gradient of the interfacial energy . in this sense each side of the polygon",

    "<S> we prove the convergence of this numerical method for the case of simple closed convex curves in the plane . </S>"
