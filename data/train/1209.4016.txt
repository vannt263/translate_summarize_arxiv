    "these four real parameters are defined in an phase - convention independent way : @xmath1 as these parameters have been determined more and more precisely over the last decade , the attention has shifted from the pure metrology of the standard model to the investigation of deviations in flavour physics , tell - tale signs of new physics ( np ) .",

    "low - energy strong interactions constitute a central issue in flavour physics , which explains the need for accurate inputs for hadronic quantities such as decay constants , form factors , bag parameters  we mostly rely on lattice qcd simulations , with a specific averaging procedure ( educated rfit ) to combine the results from different collaborations .",

    "in addition to the discrepancy between @xmath7 and @xmath8 present at the time of the winter 2012 update , a large set of information has been obtained concerning @xmath9 mixing , as well as intriguing results for the dimuon charge asymmetry .",

    "in view of these results , new cp - violating contribution to @xmath90 can be advocated to explain the dmeasurement of @xmath91  @xcite . it amounts to postulating new @xmath41 decay channels with large branching fraction .",

    "however quantities like @xmath106 will not be chirality suppressed .",
    "it seems thus hard to add large np effects to @xmath90 without spoiling the agreement of well - measured with the sm .",
    "phenomenologically it is much easier to postulate np in @xmath107 as it stems from cabibbo - suppressed decay modes like @xmath108 .",
    "chirality suppression can be invoked to avoid problems with @xmath109 , and there is no problem with inclusive decay observables like the semileptonic branching fraction or the unmeasured @xmath57 . in ref .",
