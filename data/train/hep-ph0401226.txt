    "the main features of the @xmath7-production of @xmath0 in the frame work of pqcd had been discussed in our previous work@xcite .",
    "the dominant subprocess @xmath8 is described by 24 feynman diagrams .",
    "we suppose that the amplitude of the production process can be expressed through the amplitude @xmath9 of hard production of four heavy quarks @xmath10 followed by the soft fusion of @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks into @xmath0 meson due to the meson wave function @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are four momenta of @xmath0 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the three momentum of @xmath11 quark in the @xmath0 meson rest frame .",
    "one can neglect the @xmath18 dependence in @xmath19 and get for @xmath20 wave states production the following equation :    @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the value of @xmath0 wave function value at origin ( coordinate space ) .",
    "in such approach @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks in @xmath0 have the same velocities .",
    "thus : @xmath23 @xmath24    if one need to get the yields of @xmath0 and @xmath25 separately , the product of spinors @xmath26 , corresponding to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks in the @xmath19 amplitude , should be substituted by the projection operator @xmath27 where @xmath28 for @xmath29 , or @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the polarization vector for the spin - triplet state .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily show that @xmath33 can be expressed through the @xmath34 and @xmath35 :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    the more detailed description of the calculation technique one can find in the papers @xcite , where the gluonic and photonic @xmath0 production cross sections had been calculated ( see also @xcite ) .    to get the cross section of @xmath0 production in @xmath7 collision",
    "one should covert the cross section of the subprocess @xmath8 with the distribution function of gluon in the initial proton ( we use cteq6 parametrization of pdf @xcite ) and weizscker - williams photon function .",
    "the parameter values have been chosen as follows :    @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43    the total production cross section of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons is about 5 pb . higher excitations yield about 30% to the total cross section . thus for integrated hera luminosity 1 @xmath5 about @xmath6 @xmath0 mesons will be produced .",
    "it is rather small amount of @xmath0 to find these particles at hera , because of small branching ratios of @xmath0 decay mode , which are interesting for the extraction of @xmath0 signal .",
    "nevertheless , one can hope to find these particles at hera collider .",
    ".the branching ratios of exclusive @xmath0 decay modes @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the most popular model of @xmath44 meson production is the fragmentation one . in accordance to this mechanism at large @xmath45 quark @xmath16 quark",
    "is produced in the hard process followed by the soft process of heavy quark fragmentation .",
    "for example : @xmath46 followed by @xmath47 .",
    "the meson production cross section in the frame work of fragmentational model have a very simple form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "but can we estimate the numerical value ",
    "\" large  \" @xmath50 ?    for @xmath0 production",
    "we can do it in the frame of model discussed in chapter  1 and 2 of this paper : @xmath51    at @xmath52 nonframentational terms ( recombination terms ) give the dominant contribution into @xmath0 production cross section .",
