    "discrete time quantum walks ( dtqws ) are formal generalizations of classical random walks .",
    "they were first studied in a systematic fashion by d. a. meyer @xcite , while similar but different quantum discrete dynamics was first considered in @xcite .",
    "dtqws have been realized experimentally with a wide range of physical objects and setups @xcite , and are studied in a large variety of contexts , ranging from fundamental quantum physics @xcite to quantum algorithmics @xcite , solid state physics @xcite and biophysics @xcite .",
    "particular quantum cellular automata @xcite , among which dtqws @xcite defined on various regular lattices @xcite , are known to reproduce , in the continuous limit , the dynamics of free dirac fermions in one , two or three spatial dimensions .",
    "recently , such connexions have been extensively extended to dirac fermions coupled to gauge fields @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xmath3 dtqws have been proposed which reproduce the dynamics of dirac fermions coupled to arbitrary electric @xcite and/or gravitational @xcite fields , and a @xmath0 dtqw simulating the coupling of a dirac fermion to a constant uniform magnetic field has been proposed in @xcite .    for all existing dtqws ,",
    "the gauge fields are encoded in the time and space dependence of the operator advancing the fermion in discrete spacetime .",
    "they act on the fermion but the dynamics of the fermion has no effect on the gauge fields . in other words ,",
    "the gauge fields play the roles of imposed external fields .",
    "in particular , they are not advanced by their own discrete dynamical equations , as is for example the case in lattice gauge theories ( lgts ) .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to remedy this problem and introduce the first complete self - consistent model based on dtqws where both the fermions and the fields are advanced by compatible discrete dynamical equations .",
    "the first brick in such a self - consistent model is a family of dtqws which exhibit an exact discrete gauge invariance associated to a certain group @xmath4 and which describes the coupling of dirac fermions to arbitrary @xmath4-gauge fields .",
    "the existing literature contains only one such family .",
    "the associated gauge group is @xmath1 and the dtqws describe the coupling of @xmath3 dirac fermions to arbitrary electric fields .",
    "electromagnetism is however degenerate in @xmath3 .",
    "there is no magnetic field and maxwell equations reduce to the maxwell - gauss equation , which contains no time derivative .",
    "we therefore switch to @xmath0 and introduce a new family of dtqws whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of a dirac fermion coupled to @xmath0 arbitrary electromagnetic fields .",
    "we then show that these dtqws admit ( i ) an exact discrete @xmath1 gauge invariance ( ii ) a gauge - invariant discrete electromagnetic tensor ( _ i.e. _ gauge invariant electric and magnetic fields defined on the discrete lattice of the dtqws ) ( iii ) a discrete conserved current .",
    "we finally combine the discrete electromagnetic tensor and the discrete conserved current into discrete gauge - invariant maxwell equations which imply current conservation .",
    "this literal material is complemented by numerical computations which explore how the dtqws which serve as a basis for the whole construct behave outside the continuous limit . even outside this limit , the dtqws display in the weak field regime several well - known features usually associated to standard continuous motions in electromagnetic fields , including bloch oscillations and the so - called @xmath5 drift . in the regime of strong fields ,",
    "the discrete dynamics depends crucially on whether the fields are rational or not , as expected from previous work on other dtqws @xcite .",
    "we finally discuss possible applications of our results to quantum simulation and quantum algorithmics and highlight how the new discrete gauge theory based on dtqws differs from standard lattice gauge theories ( lgts ) .",
    "we consider dtqws with two - component wavefunctions ( @xmath0 coin or spin space ) defined on a discrete @xmath6-dimensional spacetime where instants are labeled by the index @xmath7 and space points on the @xmath0 square lattice are labeled by the indices @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution equation for the wave - function reads @xmath9 where the action of the shift operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the @xmath0 wave - function @xmath12 ( the superscript @xmath13 denotes the transposition ) is : @xmath14 the coin operator @xmath15 is the product of three simpler operators : @xmath16 \\left [    \\begin{array}{c c }    \\cos \\theta &     i\\sin \\theta \\\\",
    "i\\sin \\theta &    \\cos \\theta    \\end{array }    \\right ] \\left [    \\begin{array}{c c }     e^{i\\xi } &     0 \\\\     0 &     e^{-i\\xi }    \\end{array }    \\right ] .",

    "the parameter @xmath22 which enters the definition of the constant angles @xmath23 , will be interpreted as the mass of the walk and the three angles @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which may depend on @xmath27 , will be interpreted as the components of an electromagnetic potential .",
    "the positive parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 are introduced to trace the importance of @xmath22 and @xmath30 and will tend to zero in the continuous limit .",
    "all the parameters and angles are dimensionless .",
    "the formal continuous limit of the dtqws ( [ eq : fund ] ) can be determined by the method used in @xcite : we first introduce a ( dimensionless ) spacetime - lattice step @xmath31 and interpret any @xmath32-dependent quantity @xmath33 as the value taken by a function @xmath34 at time @xmath35 and spatial position @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "we then consider the scaling @xmath38 and let @xmath39 tend to zero .",
    "we expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : fund ] ) at first order in @xmath39 around the generic spacetime point @xmath40 . for the continuous limit to exist , the zeroth - order terms of the expansion must balance each other ; this contraint is automatically verified by the dtqws defined by ( [ eq : fund ] ) .",
    "the first - order terms of the expansion in @xmath39 deliver the differential equation which determines the dynamics of the walker in the continuous limit .",
    "this equation reads : @xmath41 here , the @xmath42 matrices are defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where the pauli matrices are @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the covariant derivative associated to maxwell electromagnetism , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath42 matrices satisfy the @xmath51-dimensional flat - spacetime clifford algebra @xmath52 , where @xmath53   = \\mathrm{diag}(1,-1,-1 ) $ ] is the minkowskian metric .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dirac ] ) is the dirac equation describing the dynamics of a spin @xmath54 fermion of mass @xmath22 and charge @xmath55 coupled to the electromagnetic potential @xmath30 . to consider a generic charge @xmath56 , just perform the substitution @xmath57 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) , the characteristic speed is @xmath58 because we have chosen the same value @xmath31 for the dimensionless time and space steps .",
    "since the formal continuous limit is obtained from the dtqw dynamics by keeping terms that are first order in @xmath39 , one expects the discrepancy between a solution of the dtqw and the corresponding solution of the dirac equation to scale as @xmath59 .",
    "this can be tested numerically by computing the distance between an exact time - independent solution of the dirac equation and the time - evolution of this solution by the dtqw . for simplicity",
    "we choose @xmath60 , which does not depend on @xmath61 and generates crossed , constant and uniform electric and magnetic fields .",

    "a straightforward computation now shows that the three quantities @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 defined by @xmath96 are gauge invariant .",
    "these are clearly discrete versions of the usual electromagnetic tensor components @xmath97 . in particular , @xmath93 and @xmath94 represent respectively the two components @xmath98 and @xmath99 of a @xmath0 discrete electric field ( parallel to the plan of the @xmath100-grid ) and the component @xmath95 represents a discrete magnetic field @xmath101 perpendicular to the plan of the @xmath100-grid .",

    "having identified the discrete current @xmath120 and the finite - difference operators involved in the discrete continuity equation ( [ eq : discrete_conservation_eq ] ) makes it possible to write the following simple discrete equivalent to maxwell equations @xmath121 which connects the discrete electromagnetic tensor @xmath122 to the discrete current @xmath123 .",

( [ eq : discrete_maxwell ] ) has the standard maxwell equations as continuous limit , and ensures the conservation of the discrete current @xmath124 because it implies @xmath125 , which vanishes identically because operators @xmath114 commute with each other and because @xmath126 is antisymmetric .",

    "first , unlike the ` u ' parallel transporters in lgts , gauge fields do not have to be added by hand to the dtqw dynamics , as the connection is already part of the basic definition of dtqws and most dtqws are by definition locally gauge invariant @xcite .",
    "second , the difference operators ( discrete derivatives ) which arise in conjunction with the local gauge invariance of dtqws are more complicated than the usual finite difference operators used in lattice gauge theories . the mathematical properties of discrete gauge theories based on dtqws are thus probably very different from the mathematical properties of lgts .    finally , dtqws are useful in a much wider context than high energy or condensed matter physics .",
    "dtqws are in particular universal building blocks of quantum algorithms @xcite and our results therefore have implications for quantum information .",
    "for example , the exploration of graphs by dtqws could be influenced by creating discrete gauge fields on these graphs .",
    "indeed , not only do gauge fields influence the transport of single dtqws , but gauge theories provide a novel manner to implement interaction between dtqws ."
