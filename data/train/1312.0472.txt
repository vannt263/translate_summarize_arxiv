    "the light of distant galaxies  at least outside the local group  presents to the observer , specially to the spectroscopist , a singular feature discovered by the american astronomer vesto slipher ( 1875 - 1969 ) in the early decades of the xx century : the position of the spectral lines of the chemical elements are , in the great majority of cases , systematically displaced to wavelengths larger than those measured for the same elements ( at rest ) in earthly laboratories .",
    "being the shifts in the direction of larger wavelengths , they are called _ redshifts _ because , in the visible solar spectrum , red has the larger wavelength .",
    "such a nomenclature is adopted even when the object s spectrum is outside the visible range .",
    "less frequently , there is also the _ blueshift _ , whose definition is analogous to the redshift .    what is the cause of the redshifts of galaxies ? strictly speaking ,",
    "this is still a question in dispute .",
    "one can , however , adopt the most obvious hypothesis , namely , that they originate from the motion of the galaxies , specifically due to a motion of recession from the observer . that is , the physical phenomenon responsible for the observed spectral shifts is the so - called _",
    "doppler effect_. redshifts are usually represented by the letter z. for z@xmath00.1 , the recession velocity is then given by v@xmath1cz , where c is the speed of light in vacuum ( soares 2009 , fig .",
    "observations are done from the earth , which has a rotational motion , that originates days and nights , and an orbital translation about the sun .",
    "these velocities are variable , depending on the time of the observation but they have amplitudes of 0.5 km / s and 30 km / s , respectively , which are , in general , much smaller than galaxy velocities .",
    "even so , galaxy velocity observations are corrected for these motions and become _ heliocentric _ velocities , that is , referred to the sun .",
    "one must , next , consider the motion of the sun .",
    "this consists of the motion inside the milky way plus the motion of the milky way with respect to the general field of galaxies , or , as the american astronomer edwin hubble ( 1936 , p. 106 ) prefers _  with respect to the nebulae\"_. the observations of galaxies are expressed , as we saw ,  with respect to the sun \" , and in order to have the motion of the galaxies with respect to the general field of galaxies one might remove the motion of the sun with respect to this same field .",
    "we shall describe this procedure , in what follows , according to the method quantitatively prescribed by hubble in his influential article of 1929 and , rather clearly described in a qualitative way , in his book of 1936 entitled _ the realm of nebulae_. in section 3 , we apply hubble s method to the galaxy sample of knut lundmark , hubble s contemporary at astronomy .",
    "we conclude with general remarks in section 4 .",
    "in his book _ the realm of the nebulae _ , hubble explains how the motion of the sun influences the motion of the  nebulae \" ( i.e. , of the galaxies ; see hubble 1936 , p. 106 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ each observed velocity was thus a combination of ( a ) the  peculiar motion  of the nebula , as the individual motion is called , and ( b ) the reflection of the solar motion ( a combination of the motion of the sun within the stellar system [ i.e. , inside the milky way galaxy ] and the motion of the stellar system with respect to the nebulae ) .",
    "if sufficient nebulae were observed , their random peculiar motions would tend to cancel out , leaving only the reflection of the solar motion to emerge from the totality of the data . _    (  )    _ actually , the residual motions were still large and predominantly positive .",
    "the unsymmetrical distribution indicated the presence of some systematic effect in addition to the motion of the sun [ with respect to the nebulae ] . _",

    "the above - mentioned  systematic effect \" was modeled by hubble simply as kr  a constant times the distance to the galaxy  , differently of others in his days who added quadratic terms and even logarithmic ones in r.    quantitatively , we follow hubble ( 1929 ) .",
    "the velocity of a galaxy observed from earth , after the heliocentric correction , may be written , according to classical relativity , as the composition of two velocities : @xmath2 the letter ",
    "r \" represents the  reference frame of the nebulae \" .",
    "the motion of the reference frame of the nebulae with respect to the sun is given by the  reflection of the solar motion \"  as hubble writes  with respect to the reference frame of the nebulae , that is : @xmath3 on page 170 of hubble ( 1929 ) , the letter ",
    "v \" represents the _ radial _ velocity of a galaxy measured with respect to the sun , in other words , it is one of the components of the velocity vector .",
    "according to the explanation given by hubble above , we can then write the expression for v , wherein the  systematic effect \" proportional to the distance and the  reflection of the solar motion \" appear separately : @xmath4 figure [ fig : eqtc ] shows , in the equatorial system of coordinates , the velocity @xmath5 and the velocity v of a given galaxy .",
    "the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the figure are , respectively , the right ascension and the declination of the galaxy .",
    "and its declination is @xmath7 .",

    "[ eq : e3 ] can be derived from fig .",
    "[ fig : eqtc ] and is explicitly shown below : @xmath9 this is the very same equation that appears on page 170 of hubble ( 1929 ) . through it and the galaxy observations ( velocities and distances )",
    "we can get the solar motion with respect to the reference frame of the galaxies : @xmath10 we have in this problem four unknowns to be determined , k , x , y and z. in general , one has much more than four observed galaxies , and the resulting system of equations turns out to be overdetermined ( more equations than the number of unknowns ) .",
    "this is a rather common situation in astrophysics .",
    "for example , a binary stellar system can be spectroscopically observed in many orbital phases yielding a set of observations much larger than the number of unknowns of the problem ( orbital inclination and eccentricity , mass ratio , etc . ) .",
    "next , we shall undertake such a procedure with the list of galaxies studied by whom is , by many regarded , one of the precursors of hubble . in the end of the procedure we shall obtain the solar motion and the equivalent to the modern ",
    "hubble s constant \" for the expansion of the galaxies .",
    "in 1924 , the swedish astronomer knut lundmark ( 1889 - 1958 ) published an article where he intended to determine the radius of curvature of the space - time , in the light of the cosmological model put forward by the dutch physicist willem de sitter ( 1872 - 1934 ) in 1917 .",
    "de sitter s model predicted that light from a distant object should exhibit a redshift proportional to the object s distance .",
    "the radius of curvature would be determined from the constant of proportionality .",
    "usually , redshift was interpreted as originating from the recession velocity of the object , calculated through the doppler effect formula v = cz .",
    "lundmark , hence , discuss diagrams velocity @xmath11 distance for various classes of objects .",
    "we shall analyze his data for the so - called  spiral nebulae \" , the modern spiral galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : lund ] shows the data of lundmark ( 1924 , table iii ) .",
    "he determined the distances to the nebulae by comparing their apparent sizes and brightnesses with the size and brightness of m31 .",
    "thus distances are given in terms of the distance to m31 @xmath12 ( see more details in soares 2013 ) .",
    "adopting the modern value of @xmath13 784 kpc ( stanek and garnavich 1998 ) , we superimpose on the data some relations of proportionality of the form v = h@xmath14d , where h@xmath14 represents the modern concept of ",
    "hubble s constant \" .",
    "the value h@xmath14=12 ( km / s)/mpc is the slope of the line fitted to lundmark s data , but forced to cross the origin",
    ". a linear fit to the data has a positive interception with the velocity axis of approximately 600 km / s and a slope of h@xmath14=3 ( km / s)/mpc .",
    "the interception with the velocity axis would indicate the contamination of the data by the solar motion .",
    "one can try then to remove the solar motion using the same proceeding adopted by hubble in his work of 1929 .    ,",

    ". the slope @xmath16 ( km / s)/mpc corresponds to the fitting of @xmath17 to lundmark s data ( see also soares 2013 ) .",
    "the accepted value of hubble s constant nowadays is 72 ( km / s)/mpc with an uncertainty of 10% ( cf .",
    "freedman et al . 2001 and soares 2009 ) . , width=453 ]    in order to remove the solar motion we must solve an overdetermined system of equations , as seen in the end of section 2 .",
    "we have a model ( with a set of n unknowns or parameters  n=4 in our case , k , x , y , z ) which must reproduce a series of m observations , being m much larger than n. it is this last feature that makes the system of equations to be called _",
    "our problem consists in making minimum the differences between the prediction of the model ( the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : e4 ] ) and the measurement of the observable ( the radial velocity of a given galaxy , i.e. , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : e4 ] ) . in practice",
    ", what we minimize is the sum of the squared differences between the prediction ( which we may call _ calculated value _ ) and the observed value .",
    "this is the classical _ method of least squares_.    the results we obtained , by reproducing hubble s 1929 methodology , implies into corrections in the observed velocities which , surprisingly , does not significantly affect the determination of the constant k ( the modern ",
    "hubble s constant \" ) .",

    ". such galaxies are not appropriate to lundmark s method of distance calculation , which is based in the comparison of apparent size and brightness with a spiral galaxy , m31 .",
    "this sample has 30 galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : all ] shows three diagrams : the sample without correction and a fit v = kr , the sample corrected by hubble s 1929 solar motion and a fit v = kr , and the sample corrected for the solar motion , by the method of least squares applied to eq .",
    "[ eq : e4 ] and the resulting line v = kr .",
    "as we can see , hubble s constant in all three cases is not substantially different .",
    "the obtained values are , however , smaller than the modern value of h@xmath14=72 ( km / s)/mpc .",

    "[ fig : nearby ] , the solar motion correction does not significantly affect the determination of @xmath20 .",
    "incidentally , it is interesting to point out that the original sample of hubble ( excluding the negative velocities ) _ without solar motion correction _ gives a linear correlation v = kr , with k=446 ( km / s)/mpc , consistent with the value determined by him _",
    "after solar motion correction _ ( k = 465@xmath22 ) .    qualitatively , the solar motion obtained with lundmark s reduced sample is compatible with the one obtained by hubble .",
    "the solar motion apex in hubble ( @xmath2319 hours and @xmath24 + 40 degrees ) sits approximately in the direction of the star vega , the brightest star of the lyra constellation . with lundmark s 12-galaxy sample ,",
    "the apex sits nearby , in the boundary between lyra and vulpecula constellations ( @xmath2319 hours and @xmath24 + 23 degrees ) .",
    "however , the uncertainty of distances in both samples makes almost irrelevant such similarities .",
    "in the modern relativistic cosmology , redshifts of distant objects are interpreted as the result of expanding space . for small values of z , as those discussed here , i.e. , z@xmath251 , both interpretations  doppler effect and expanding space  are mathematically indistinguishable ( see soares 2009 , fig .",
    "the influence of the solar motion on galaxy velocities is only physically meaningful within the interpretation of redshifts as originating from the doppler effect .",
    "the idea that there might be a component of systematic motion in the nebula velocities , as mentioned in the beginning of section 2 , was not hubble s .",
    "it had been introduced by the german astronomer carl wilhelm wirtz ( 1876 - 1939 ) in 1918 , following what was already done in the determination of the solar motion with respect to the stars ( hubble 1936 , p. 107 ) .",
    "wirtz assumed then the existence of a _ k - term _ ( or _ k - correction _ ) as a constant velocity ( k from the german _ konstant _ ) , which might be subtracted from the nebula velocities , before the solar motion determination : @xmath26 where k is the velocity correction that should be applied to v. with such a correction and the removal of the solar motion , the situation of the velocity residuals of wirtz nebulae improved , but still was not entirely satisfactory : they did not distribute in a completely random way  as expected  and , in addition to that , the derived k - term was of about 800 km / s , intriguingly large and comparable to the resulting solar motion ( @xmath19700 km / s ) .",
    "the situation would considerably improve with the introduction of the k - correction varying with distance , as done by hubble in 1929 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : e4 ] ) .",
    "the solar motion determined by him , in such a way , was of about 300 km / s , in the approximate direction of vega ( hubble 1936 , p. 114 ) , and the velocity residuals were satisfactorily random .",
    "hubble s ingenuity was his decision in adopting the simplest hypothesis for the variable k - correction , namely , of the type kr , while other astronomers got lost in much more complicated  and at that point unnecessary and even unjustifiable  k(r ) expressions .",
    "on the other hand , hubble was aware that the relationship v = kr was consistent with the prediction of de sitter s cosmological model ( hubble 1929 , p. 173 ) .",
    "as we have seen , solar motion correction in the early extragalactic astrophysics did not turn out to be important in the determination of the theoretical expansion parameter , mainly because of the significant errors in distance determination . in modern extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology ,",
    "however , distances and spectral shifts are determined with much better precision and solar motion correction becomes a fundamental aspect of the evaluation of theoretical parameters .    nowadays ,",
    "the observations of galaxies outside the local group , from a given observatory , are submitted to two corrections .",
    "first , as before , the heliocentric correction is done , and , in the second place , differently of what has been done above , the solar motion correction is done with respect to the barycenter  or centroid  of the local group of galaxies .",
    "velocities become then referred to to the center of the local group , and may then be used in the investigations of extragalactic issues , such as the expanding universe problem . for the technical details of these corrections",
