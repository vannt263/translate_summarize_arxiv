    "their results show that one should aim to shorten the duration and spatial extent of flow separation in the diverging direction of a jet pump to increase its performance .",
    "king and smith have shown that this can be accomplished by decreasing the taper angle of the geometry and by operating at either a higher reynolds number for a given displacement amplitude or a lower displacement amplitude for a given reynolds number .",
