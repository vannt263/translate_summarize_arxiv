    "the developments in modern communication systems are rapid , especially quantum communication systems which set new kinds of limitations and offer new possibilities .",
    "channel robustness and security are two of the basic features of many information processing systems , since many modern communication systems are often not perfect , but are vulnerable to jamming and eavesdropping .",
    "there is already work done in the security of quantum information transmission using quantum key distributions ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for two well - known examples ) .",
    "but our goal is to have a more general theory for channel robustness and security in quantum information theory , i.e. message transmission should be secure against every possible kind of jamming and eavesdropping . furthermore , we are interested in asymptotic behavior when we deliver a large volume of messages by many channel uses .",
    "therefore , we consider a new paradigm for the design of quantum channel systems , which is called embedded security . here",
    "we embed protocols with a guaranteed security into the bottom layer of the model of communications systems , which is physical layer .",
    "we use channels , for example fiber - optic cables , for generating and transmitting secure messages which generate secure keys , or robust and secure message transmissions .",
    "this is a new concept in physical layer service integration .    in the model of an arbitrarily varying channel ,",
    "we consider channel uncertainty , i.e. , transmission over a channel which is not stationary , but can change with every use of the channel .",
    "we interpret it as a channel with an evil jammer .",
    "it is understood that the sender and the receiver have to select their coding scheme first .",
    "after that the jammer makes his choice of the channel state .",
    "the arbitrarily varying channel was first introduced by blackwell , breiman , and thomasian in @xcite .",
    "we envision the scenario as follows .",
    "the sender and the legal receiver use a fiber - optic cable for message transmission , but they do not have a perfect protection against the environment , i.e. , the environment can interfere with the fiber - optic cable .",
    "we may consider the environment to be hostile , i.e. , there is a jammer who can change the nature of the fiber - optic cable to sabotage the message transmission .",
    "however , due to the physical properties , we consider that the jammer s changes only take place in a known set . hence",
    ", the jammer is not `` almighty '' .    in the context of arbitrarily varying channels",
    ", randomness can be an important resource for reliable communication over an arbitrarily varying channel .",
    "ahlswede showed in @xcite ( cf . also @xcite and @xcite ) , the surprising result that either the deterministic capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel is zero , or it equals its randomness assisted capacity ( ahlswede dichotomy ) . in @xcite , a sufficient condition for the zero deterministic capacity is given .",

    "it is defined as a family of pairs of indexed channels @xmath0 with a common input alphabet and possible different output alphabets , connecting a sender with two receivers , a legal one and a wiretapper , where @xmath1 is called a channel state of the channel pair .",
    "the legitimate receiver accesses the output of the first part of the pair , i.e. , the first channel @xmath2 in the pair , and the wiretapper observes the output of the second part , i.e. , the second channel @xmath3 , respectively . a channel state @xmath1 , which varies from symbol to symbol in an arbitrary manner , governs both the legal receiver s channel and the wiretap channel . a code for the channel conveys information to the legal receiver such that the wiretapper knows nothing about the transmitted information in the sense of the stronger security criterion ( cf .",

    "this shows that the research in quantum channels with channel uncertainty and eavesdropping can lead to some promising applications .",
    "in this section we present the result if we use the technique of @xcite for the entanglement transmission over an arbitrarily varying quantum channel . as we discussed in section [ bdacs ] , this result is very weak .",
    "firstly , ( [ equ1 ] ) gives only a lower bound of the entanglement generation , and we suppose that this lower bound is loose ( cf .",

    "the first part of the decoding operator and the encoder arise from a code for an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel with the assistance of stinespring dilation , while the second part is built with the assistance of error correcting code technique .",
    "one of the reasons why we just obtain the weak result ( [ equ1 ] ) is that using stinespring dilation for building code to transmit entanglement is suboptimal ( cf .",

    "the weakness of corollary [ schwacheserg ] shows that for the entanglement transmission over a quantum channel with channel uncertainty , we will need a much more sophisticated method than the technique for the entanglement transmission over a quantum channel without channel uncertainty .",
    "in this paper we studied message transmission over a classical - quantum channel with both a jammer and an eavesdropper , which is called an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel .",
    "we also studied how helpful various resources can be .",
    "ahlswede dichotomy for classical arbitrarily varying channels was introduced in @xcite . the ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum channels",
    "was established in @xcite . in our paper",
    "we have generalized the result of @xcite by establishing the ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels : either the deterministic secrecy capacity of an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel is zero , or it equals its randomness assisted secrecy capacity .",
    "interestingly , ahlswede dichotomy shows that the deterministic capacity for secure message transmission is , in general , not specified by entropy quantities .",
    "this is a new behavior in communication due to active wiretap attacks .",
    "dealing with channel uncertainty and eavesdropping is one of the main tasks in modern communication systems , caused , for example , by hardware imperfection . for practical implementation ,",
    "a reasonable assistance is to make resources available to the transmitters .",
    "for example , in wireless communication , the communication service may send some signals via satellite to its users .",
    "hence we analyzed the secrecy capacities of various coding schemes with resource assistance .",
    "a surprising and promising result of this paper is that the resources do not have to be secure themselves to be helpful for secure message transmission considering channel uncertainty .",
    "another interesting fact is that in @xcite , it has been shown that the correlation is a much `` cheaper '' resource than randomness and common randomness .",
    "however , the results in this paper show that for secure message transmission considering channel uncertainty .",
    "correlation is as helpful as randomness and common randomness .",
    "furthermore , a correlation @xmath112 does not have to be `` very good '' to be helpful in achieving a positive secrecy capacity , since @xmath112 is a helpful resource even if @xmath385 is only slightly larger than zero .",
    "we also gave an example that shows not only theoretically , but also physically , how helpful a resource can be .",
    "in this example , an arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channel has zero deterministic secrecy capacity , but as soon as the sender and the receiver can use a resource , either randomness , common randomness , or correlation , we can achieve positive secrecy capacity .",
    "this example shows that for communication in practice , having weak public signals will be very useful .",
    "moreover , we gave an example which shows how difficult it can be to find a result similar to the ahlswede dichotomy for the entanglement generating capacity of an arbitrarily varying quantum channel , and why it is so difficult .",
    "if we consider classical - quantum channel with channel uncertainty and eavesdropping , we show that many new kinds of difficulties can appear .",
    "this shows that ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels is a result which is far from trivial .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the phenomenon `` super - activation '' can occur for certain quantum channels ( `` @xmath672 '' ) . in this paper",
    ", we have proved that `` super - activation '' occurs for arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels . in classical information theory , adding a telegraph wire that relays no information to a system does not help in the majority of cases .",
    "our result shows that for message transmission over classical - quantum channels with both a jammer and an eavesdropper , adding a fiber - optic cable that relays no secure information can be really useful .",
    "this result sets a new challenging task for the design of media access control , which is an important topic for standardization and certification . unlike in classical communication , for quantum media access control",
    ", we have to consider that we can lose security if we have two orthogonal useless arbitrarily varying classical - quantum wiretap channels . to provide security",
    ", we therefore need a more sophisticated design of media access control than in the classical case .",
