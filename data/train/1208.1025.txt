    "the processes @xmath2 with @xmath3 are of great interest for our understanding of qcd and of the meson structure . in recent years",
    ", extensive experimental information on these processes has become available @xcite .",
    "the corresponding amplitude contains only one form factor , @xmath4 : @xmath5 a qcd factorization theorem predicts this form factor at asymptotically large spacelike momentum transfers @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8 hereafter , we use the notation @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( that is , @xmath11 is the  larger virtuality ) . for the experimentally relevant kinematics @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for instance , the pion  photon transition form factor takes the form @xmath14 similar relations arise for @xmath15 and @xmath16 after taking into account the effects of meson  mixing .",
    "the starting point for a qcd sum - rule analysis of the @xmath2 transition form factor  is the amplitude @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the relevant photon polarization vectors .",
    "this amplitude is considered for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "its general decomposition contains four independent lorentz structures ( see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) but for our purpose only one structure is needed : @xmath21 the corresponding invariant amplitude @xmath22 satisfies the spectral representation in @xmath23 at fixed @xmath24 and @xmath11 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the physical spectral density and @xmath27 denotes the physical threshold .",
    "perturbation theory yields the spectral density as a series expansion in powers of @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of the quark propagating in the loop .",
    "the lowest - order contribution , @xmath31 , corresponding to a one - loop triangle diagram with one axial current and two vector currents at the vertices , is well - known @xcite .",
    "the two - loop @xmath32 correction to the spectral density was found to vanish @xcite .",
    "higher - order corrections are unknown .",
    "the physical spectral density differs dramatically from @xmath33 in the low-@xmath34 region ; it contains the meson pole and the hadronic continuum . for instance , in the @xmath35 channel , one has @xmath36 the method of qcd sum rules allows one to relate the properties of the ground states to the spectral densities of qcd correlators .",
    "the following steps are conventional within the qcd sum - rule method @xcite : equate the qcd and the physical representations for @xmath37 ; then perform the borel transform @xmath38 which suppresses the hadronic continuum ; in order to kill then potentially dangerous nonperturbative power corrections which may rise with @xmath39 , take the local - duality ( ld ) limit @xmath40 @xcite ; finally , implement quark ",
    "hadron duality in a standard way as low - energy cut on the spectral representation , in order to arrive at the following expression for the ground - state transition form factor : @xmath41 all details of the nonperturbative - qcd dynamics are contained in the effective threshold @xmath42 . the formulation of reliable criteria for fixing effective thresholds proves to be highly nontrivial @xcite .    at large @xmath43 and fixed ratio @xmath44 ,",
    "the effective threshold @xmath42 may be determined by suitable matching to the asymptotic pqcd factorization formula . from this",
    ", one finds that , in the general case @xmath45 , @xmath46 depends on @xmath47 .",
    "the only exception to this is the case of massless fermions , @xmath48 : in this case the asymptotic factorization formula is reproduced for any @xmath47 if one sets @xmath49 the ld _ model _ for the transition form factor emerges when one _ assumes _ that , at finite values of @xmath39 , @xmath50 may be sufficiently well approximated by its value for @xmath51 , that  is , @xmath52 introducing the abbreviation @xmath53 for the pseudoscalar - meson  photon transition form factor , its ld expression for @xmath54 and @xmath48 reads , in the single - flavour case , @xmath55 independently of the behaviour of @xmath56 at @xmath57 , @xmath58 is related to the axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the ld model for the effective threshold may be estimated in quantum mechanics . there , the form factor may be found exactly by some numerical solution @xcite of the schrdinger equation . from this , the _ exact _ effective threshold may be calculated : for any given experimental or theoretical form factor , the corresponding exact effective threshold is defined as the quantity that reproduces this form factor by a ld sum rule  ( [ ldsr ] ) .    the result from a quantum - mechanical model with a harmonic - oscillator potential @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . for `` light '' quarks",
    ", the ld threshold gives a very good approximation to the exact threshold for @xmath60@xmath61 .",
    "for `` charm '' quarks , the local - duality model works for @xmath62@xmath63 .",
    "the accuracy of the ld approximation further increases with  @xmath64 in this region .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     first of all , we emphasize that the large-@xmath39 behaviour of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath65 form factors is determined by the spectral densities of perturbative qcd diagrams and should therefore be the same for all light pseudoscalars @xcite . in order to demonstrate this , we observe that the sum rule for @xmath66 in the ld limit @xmath40 is equivalent to the anomaly sum rule @xcite @xmath67.\\ ] ] similar relations arise for the @xmath68 and the @xmath69 channels . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the form factors @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 at large @xmath39 are determined by the behaviour of the appropriate @xmath73 at large @xmath34 . by quark ",
    "hadron duality , the latter are equal to the corresponding @xmath74 ; these are purely perturbative quantities and therefore  equal to each other for the different channels .    however , the babar data for the @xmath75 transition form factor exhibit a clear disagreement with both the @xmath15 , @xmath16 form factors and the ld model at @xmath39 as large as @xmath76 . moreover ,",
    "opposite to findings in quantum mechanics , the violations of ld rise with @xmath39 even in the region @xmath77 ! we thus conclude that the babar results are hard to understand in qcd ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "noteworthy , recent belle measurements of the @xmath78 form factor  although being statistically consistent with the babar findings ( see @xcite)are fully compatible with the @xmath15 and @xmath16 data as well as with the onset of the ld regime already in the region @xmath79@xmath80 , in full agreement with our quantum - mechanical experience .",
    "we studied the @xmath65 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath81 transition form factors by qcd sum rules in ld limit ; the key parameter ",
    "the effective continuum threshold  was determined by matching the ld form factors to qcd factorization formulas .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    @xmath82 for all @xmath83 form factors studied , the ld model should work well in a region of @xmath39 larger than a few gev@xmath84 : the ld model works reasonably well for the @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 form factors . for @xmath88 ,",
    "the babar data indicate an extreme violation of local duality , prompting a linearly rising ( instead of a constant ) effective threshold .",
    "in contrast to this , the belle data exhibit an agreement with the predictions of the ld  model .",
    "@xmath82 nevertheless , a better fit to the full set of the meson ",
    "photon form - factor data seems to prefer a small logarithmic rise of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "if established experimentally , this rise would require the presence of a @xmath90 duality - violating term in the ratio of the hadron  and the qcd spectral densities .",
    "@xmath82 a high accuracy of the ld model has implications for the pion s _ elastic _ form factor : we can show that the accuracy of the ld model for the _ elastic _ form factor increases with  @xmath39 in the region @xmath91@xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the accurate data on the pion form factor suggest that the ld limit for the effective threshold , @xmath93 , may be reached already at @xmath94@xmath95 .",
    "this property should be testable with the jlab upgrade clas12 .",
