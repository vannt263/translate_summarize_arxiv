    "finding the global behavior of an analytic function in terms of its taylor coefficients is a notoriously difficult problem , in fact one which is impossible in full generality since undecidable statements can be formulated in these terms .",
    "however , a very interesting and quite general criterion for the disk of convergence of a taylor series to coincide with its maximal domain of analyticity was recently discovered by breuer and simon @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper complements this result by finding criteria on the taylor coefficients , say at zero , for the associated analytic function not to have natural boundaries and to belong to the class @xmath0 of functions analytic in the complex plane with finitely many cuts and with algebraic behavior at infinity ( see definition [ def21 ] below ) .",
    "our condition is that the coefficients @xmath1 admit generalized borel summable ( or ecalle - borel summable , eb ) transseries in @xmath2 .",
    "many general classes of problems in analysis are known to have eb transseries solutions . for details on generalized borel summability ,",
    "transseries and resurgence see @xcite .",
    "in particular it is known @xcite that , if the @xmath1 are solutions of generic linear or nonlinear recurrence relations of arbitrary but finite order with analytic coefficients , then they are are eb - summable .",
    "recurrence relations exist for instance when the coefficients are obtained by solving differential equations by power series . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we show that the taylor coefficients of the borel transform of solutions of generic systems of linear or nonlinear odes ( in the setting of @xcite ) also admit eb summable transseries .",
    "the global analytic structure of the borel transform is crucial in understanding the monodromy of solutions of such equations .",
    "we also extend our procedure to analyze the global behavior of entire functions , and to formal series , giving criteria directly on the coefficients for the formal series to be borel summable .    globally reconstructing function from its taylor coefficients , when these admit eb summable transseries is effective , constructive and explicit -in the sense of producing integral representations far easier to analyze than the sums ; this provides a new summation procedure , generalizing in some ways the poisson summation formula .",
    "we recently used this approach to analyze a class of linear pdes with variable coefficients , @xcite .",
    "one can obtain explicit integral representations for solutions of odes not known to be solvable such as @xmath3 arising as the scaling pinching profile @xmath4 of the thin film equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the singularity time , where the interest is in the solution _ analytic at zero , @xmath7_. let @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . while it is not clear how to obtain representations of @xmath7 itself , the taylor coefficients of @xmath7 are explicit . from this ,",

    "we will use some particularly simple examples for illustration .",
    "for the first one , the generalized hurwitz zeta function , our procedure quickly yields one of the known integral representations . for the other three ,",
