    "the measured dilepton rates in heavy ion experiments show an enhancement in the low invariant mass regime of a few hundred mev and are getting sensitive to transport properties which are relevant in the hydrodynamic regime of small invariant masses @xcite .",
    "the spectral representation of the correlation functions of the vector current directly relates to the invariant mass spectrum of dileptons and photons and in the limit of small frequencies determines a transport coefficient , in the case of the vector correlation function of light quarks , the electical conductivity .",
    "+ at temperatures relevant for current heavy ion experiments , non - perturbative techniques are mandatory for the determination of those quantities .",
    "perturbative studies of the vector spectral functions @xcite and also the inclusion of nonperturbative aspects through the hard thermal loop resummation scheme @xcite break down , especially in the low invariant mass region indicated by an infrared divergent euclidean correlator @xcite leading to an infinite electrical conductivity .",
    "instead it was demonstrated that the spectral function at low invariant masses will increase linearly resulting in a finite electrical conductivity of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "+ in @xcite we have analyzed the behaviour of the vector correlation function at @xmath0 and performed its extrapolation to the continuum limit based on precise data at various lattice sizes , corresponding to different lattice cutoffs .",
    "while only small finite volume effects were observed in this study , large cutoff effects in the correlation functions require small lattice spacings and a proper continuum extrapolation to obtain reliable results for the determination of the spectral properties and the extraction of the dilepton rates and transport coefficients .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : gvcont ] ( left ) our results for the vector correlation function normalized by the corresponding continuum free correlator and the quark number susceptibilty @xmath2 are shown for various lattice sizes @xmath3 together with the continuum extrapolation @xcite .",
    "the strong cutoff effects at small separations @xmath4 on the lattices with small temporal extend @xmath5 clearly show the necessity for the continuum extrapolation . only on the finest lattice and in the extrapolation",
    "the relevant physical behaviour of the vector correlation function becomes apparent and a reliable continuum extrapolation at distance @xmath6 could be performed .",
    "+ we used an ansatz for the vector spectral function , @xmath7 that depends on four temperature dependent parameters ; the quark number susceptibility @xmath8 , the strength ( @xmath9 ) and width ( @xmath10 ) of the breit - wigner peak and the parameter @xmath11 that parametrizes deviations from a free spectral function at large energies . at high temperature and for large energies , @xmath12",
    ", we expect to find @xmath13 .",
    "+ the parameters are determined by a fit to the continuum extrapolated vector correlation function . in order to analyze the influence of the low energy structure of the spectral function and to analyze the systematic uncertainties of the ansatz",
    ", we have smoothly truncated the continuum contribution at some energy @xmath14 by multiplying the second term in ( [ ansatz ] ) with @xmath15 .",
    "details of the fit procedure including additional information obtained from thermal moments of the spectral functions are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectral functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] for different values of @xmath14 and @xmath16 that lead to @xmath17d.o.f smaller than unity .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : dilepton ] we show the thermal dilepton rate @xmath18 for two massless ( @xmath19 ) flavors .",
    "the results are compared to a dilepton spectrum calculated within the hard thermal loop approximation @xcite using a thermal quark mass @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 the results are in good agreement and for @xmath22 differences between the htl spectral function and our numerical results are about a factor two , which is the intrinsic uncertainty in our spectral analysis .",
    "+ while for energies @xmath23 the htl results grow too rapidly , from our numerical results we obtain a finite electrical conductivity , @xmath24",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the vector correlation function at a fixed temperature of @xmath25 in the high temperature phase of quenched qcd .",
    "the results allowed for a determination of the spectral properties and the resulting dilepton rate as well as an estimate for the electrical conductivity of the qgp .",
    "+ first results at different temperatures , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gvcont ] ( right ) ) , show a qualitatively similar behaviour for the vector correlation function .",
    "even at the smallest temperature of @xmath28 no signals for a sizeable contribution of a @xmath29-resonance are visible . however",
    "a detailed analysis of the spectral properties at temperatures close to the critical one remains to be performed in future .",
    "+ furthermore in order to analyze to what extent the low mass enhancement observed in our estimate for the dilepton rate can account for the experimentally observed enhancement of dilepton rates at low energies @xcite results over the whole temperature region probed experimentally as well as knowledge on its momentum dependence is needed together with a realistic model for the hydrodynamic expansion of dense matter created in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
