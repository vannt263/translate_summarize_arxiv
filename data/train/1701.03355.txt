    "<S> significant enhancement of the light - matter interaction is demonstrated under selective laser excitation of those quantum dots which are in resonance with the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement is manifested through rabi oscillations of the photon echo , demonstrating coherent control of excitons with picosecond pulses at intensity levels more than an order of magnitude smaller as compared with bare quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the photon echo transients is weakly changed by the resonator indicating a small decrease of the coherence time @xmath0 which we attribute to the interaction with the electron plasma in the metal layer located close ( 40  nm ) to the qd layer . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously we see a reduction of the population lifetime @xmath1 , inferred from the stimulated photon echo , due to an enhancement of the spontaneous emission by a factor of 2 , which is attributed to the purcell effect , while non - radiative processes are negligible as confirmed from time - resolved photoluminescence .    </S>",
    "<S> light - matter interaction in photonic nanostructures attracts strong attention in all areas of optics . </S>",
    "<S> efficient coupling at the nanoscale plays a decisive role for realization of single photon emitters and other nonclassical light sources of importance in quantum information technologies .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite various structural concepts based on photonic crystals , patterned microcavities or plasmonic structures have been intensely studied in that respect.@xcite another interesting system is a tamm - plasmon ( tp ) resonator in which confinement of the optical field is obtained between a distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) and a thin metal layer , leading to the appearance of a tp photonic mode.@xcite in addition , tp structures support surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) , evanescent electromagnetic waves at the metal - semiconductor interface which can propagate along this interface . </S>",
    "<S> especially interesting in such a system is the coupling between spps and tp cavity modes.@xcite therefore these structures are appealing for generation of spps via optical or electrical pumping of a close active layer containing , e.g. , semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) . in general , the integration of semiconductors into plasmonic circuits is appealing for compensating losses or switching in these circuits . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the metal mirror may be used as an electrode to apply a bias voltage for controlling the charging state of the qds or pumping the optically active layer electrically.@xcite as active material in the resonator single or multiple quantum well ( qw )  @xcite or qd  @xcite layers as well as organic materials  @xcite were used . </S>",
    "<S> so far , efforts have mainly been focused on time - integrated and time - resolved studies of the emission under non - resonant excitation . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the purcell effect of single qd excitons coupled to a localized tp mode,@xcite enhancement of the spontaneous emission  @xcite and coherent laser emission  @xcite were demonstrated .    </S>",
    "<S> coherent spectroscopy such as transient four - wave mixing ( tfwm ) is a powerful tool for investigating the nonlinear optical phenomena and coherent dynamics of optical excitations confined in semiconductor nanostructures.@xcite it allows one to study ensembles of light emitters and to perform direct measurements of their times for dephasing , decoherence , and population decay . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the strong field regime rabi oscillations can be used for direct evaluation of the light - matter interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> tfwm and two - dimensional fourier spectroscopy were used to investigate the coherent optical response of exciton - polaritons in qw and qd based microcavities with high quality factors ( strong coupling regime).@xcite qds were also implemented in low quality dbr - based cavities in order to increase the strength of tfwm signal and to study the corresponding coherent optical phenomena.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge there are no studies of the nonlinear optical phenomena under resonant excitation in tp resonators .        the unique feature of tp structures is the possibility to use an arbitrary in - plane design of a metallic layer on top of the semiconductor . covering only a part of the sample with a gold film allows comparison of the strength of light - matter interaction within the same qd ensemble so that size distribution and qd density remain the same . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the coherent optical response of planar qd - tp structures to picosecond laser pulses occurs in form of photon echoes ( pes ) : ( i ) the magnitude of the pe signal and its dependence on excitation intensity differ drastically from bare qds . from rabi oscillations we estimate the enhancement factor for the driving optical field in the tp structure . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) from two - pulse and three - pulse pe transients we evaluate the decoherence and population decay times of excitons in the tp microcavity and compare them with bare qds .    </S>",
    "<S> the investigated structures and experimental approach are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : r - pl ] . the sample was grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on a gaas ( 001 ) semi - insulating substrate . </S>",
    "<S> it comprises 20 pairs of @xmath2 gaas / alas layers forming the back dbr mirror with the stop - band located in the spectral region of interest ( @xmath3  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> a single ( in , ga)as qd layer in the gaas cavity layer is located about 125  nm above the dbr and 40 nm below the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the gaas layer @xmath4 beneath the qds is slightly varied by a wedge design which allows tuning the cavity resonance by the position of the excitation spot along the gradient axis @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : r - pl](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> half of the sample is covered with a 40 nm thick gold layer , which leads to formation of the tp photon mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the qd layer is located at the maximum of the electric field distribution , @xmath6 nm away from the gold layer ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : r - pl](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is close enough to the gold to ensure that the coupling to the tp mode is strong , but far enough so that quenching of the photoluminescence ( pl ) due to surface states , in particular at the uncovered surface , does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> the qd density is about @xmath7@xmath8 , their height and lateral sizes before overgrowth are about 2.3  nm and 25  nm , respectively.@xcite in order to prevent tunneling of photoexcited carriers into the metal layer , a 10  nm al@xmath9ga@xmath10as barrier was introduced between the qds and the surface ( 20  nm below the surface ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied structures with a single layer of ( in , ga)as qds which is embedded in a gaas @xmath11 microcavity of similar quality factor formed by two dbr mirrors.@xcite    the low temperature ( @xmath12  k ) photoluminescence spectrum from the bare qds under non - resonant excitation with photon energy @xmath13  ev shows a broad spectral band centered at about 1.35  ev ( fig .  [ fig : r - pl](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the large inhomogeneous broadening of @xmath14  mev originates from fluctuations of qd size and composition in the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the emission from the same part of the sample , but covered with gold shows a resonant enhancement of the pl signal around the photon energy of the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> the pl has a significantly narrower bandwidth with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of only 12  mev . </S>",

    "<S> fig : r - pl](b)).@xcite    the coherent optical response is measured using degenerate tfwm with a sequence of three spectrally narrow ps - pulses in non - collinear reflection geometry as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : r - pl](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> a mode - locked tunable ti : sa laser with a repetition frequency of 75.75  mhz was used as source of the optical pulses . </S>",

    "<S> the sample is kept at @xmath12  k. the transients are measured by taking the cross - correlation of the tfwm signal @xmath24 with the reference pulse using heterodyne detection.@xcite the spectral width of the optical pulses of 0.8  mev is significantly smaller than the width of the resonator mode , i.e. the lifetime of the tp mode in the microcavity is shorter than the pulse duration of @xmath25  ps . at zero magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> resonantly excited qds can be considered as isolated two - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> note that excitation of few - particle complexes such as biexcitons is excluded because the spectral width of the laser line is below the biexciton binding energy of about 2  mev . from these parameters </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the tfwm signal is determined by photon echoes due to the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions in the qd ensemble . in the case of the tp </S>",

    "<S> ]    the dependence of the pe amplitude on the intensity of the excitation pulses can be used to compare the strength of light - matter interaction in both systems . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dependence of the two - pulse pe on the energy of second pulse , @xmath32 , shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rabi](a ) and [ fig : rabi](b ) for the bare qds and the tp microcavity , respectively , for identical experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> strong inhomogeneous broadening of optical transitions can lead to a significant modification of the photon echo transients when the energy of the first pulse is scanned.@xcite first , in the tp microcavity one achieves significantly stronger pe amplitudes for low pulse energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35  nj . second , in the tp microcavity one observes a non - monotonous behavior which resembles the one expected for rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> both features indicate a considerable enhancement of the light - matter interaction in the tp cavity which allows us to work in the nonlinear regime already at moderate intensities .    for isolated two - level systems in absence of decoherence processes and when optical pulses with rectangular intensity profile are assumed the amplitude of the pe follows the simple relation  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rabi frequency which is determined by the electric field amplitude of the second pulse @xmath38 and the dipole matrix element of the two - level system @xmath39 . in our case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is fixed while @xmath41 is varied . </S>",
    "<S> we use this expression to evaluate the electromagnetic field amplitude inside the microcavity @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation should be valid also in the strong field limit because the lifetime of the cavity mode is the shortest time scale compared to the duration of the excitation pulses and the radiative lifetime in the qds . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath43  nj the pe oscillatory behavior in the tp - qd structure is reasonably well reproduced by eq .   with the @xmath44-rotation occuring at @xmath45  nj . however , for larger pulse areas significant damping of the rabi oscillations takes place . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to a statistical distribution of the dipole moments @xmath39 in the qd ensemble which results in a variation of the pulse area @xmath46 and blurring of the rabi oscillations .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite assuming a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation @xmath47 centered around @xmath48 we obtain @xmath49}\\exp{[-\\frac{(\\theta_0-\\theta)^2}{2\\sigma^2\\theta^2}}]d\\theta$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit to the experimental data is obtained for @xmath50 as shown by the solid curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rabi](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is in good agreement with previous results on similar qd ensembles.@xcite in addition other mechanisms such as the interaction with acoustic phonons can lead to damping of the rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is expected to be strongest for pulses with durations of several ps as used in our experiment.@xcite    in contrast to the tp microcavity structure , the @xmath30 for the bare wafer follows a quadratic dependence on @xmath51 which indicates that the pulse area is significantly below @xmath44 even for pulse energies as large as @xmath52  nj . thus a significant enhancement of the light - matter interaction is clearly present in the tp cavity . </S>",
    "<S> direct comparison of the intensities allows us to estimate the enhancement factor of the electromagnetic field for coherent excitation of the qds . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that the pe signal depends on both @xmath53 and @xmath32 , we estimate that the pulse area in eq .   is enhanced by a factor of 6 , i.e. the amplitude of the electromagnetic field @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : transients](a ) and [ fig : transients](b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the pe decay reflects an irreversible loss of optical coherence ( i.e. , of the medium s polarization ) due to interaction of the two - level systems with the environment and/or radiative damping . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transients](a ) that the signal can be described by a double exponential decay @xmath59 including a short coherence time @xmath60  ps and an approximately 10 times longer coherence time @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the short dynamics are attributed to fast energy relaxation of qd excitons excited in higher energy states , e.g. in @xmath61-shell states,@xcite into the ground state . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the long - lived signal with @xmath0 decay time corresponds to the coherent response of excitons in the ground @xmath62-shell . </S>",
    "<S> excitation of excitons in different energy shells is possible due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transition energies in the studied qds . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the long component decays faster in the tp microcavity with @xmath63  ps , while in the bare qds @xmath64  ps , i.e the coherent decay is twice slower ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .    </S>",

    "<S> we calculate the pure dephasing time @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 turns out to be shorter for the excitons confined in the qds in the tp microcavity , @xmath69  ps , as compared with the bare qds , @xmath70  ps . as this time exceeds the exciton lifetime , the pure dephaing is neverheless weak . in a studied fully dielectric dbr structure with </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 the pure dephasing is negligible and the ground state exciton coherence is radiatively limited : @xmath72 with @xmath73  ps . the latter value has approximately the same magnitude as for bare qds . from the comparison we conclude that the exciton coherence in the bare qds is somewhat reduced by charges at the surface 40 nm separated from the dot layer . </S>",
    "<S> the gold layer of the tp cavity induces further decoherence which can be attributed to the interaction between excitons and plasmons .    </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime measurements deduced from the spe in fig .  [ fig : transients](b ) show that for the tp microcavity @xmath1 is approximately halved compared to the bare qds . </S>",
    "<S> this shortening most likely is due to the purcell effect.@xcite however , we have to consider also non - radiative processes due to tunneling of photoexcited carriers from the qds into the nearby metal as potential origin . </S>",
    "<S> further insight can be obtained from pl transients measured using a streak camera for below - barrier pulsed excitation with photon energy @xmath74  ev . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are shown in fig .  </S>",
