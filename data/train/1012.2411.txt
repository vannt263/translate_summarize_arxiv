    "near infrared ( nir ) detector technology has made great strides over the past two decades and large format arrays with excellent performance are now commercially available .",
    "substrate - removed devices extend the wavelength sensitivity of near infrared detectors into the uv and highly integrated read - out asics provide compact , low power front - end electronics .",
    "advances in detector technology make nir detectors well suited for space - based wide - field imaging instruments , which are critical for pursuing some of the major scientific questions of our time .",
    "one of the most far - reaching problems in physics today is the lack of understanding of the nature of dark energy .",
    "the investigation of dark energy is most efficiently pursued with experiments that employ a combination of different observational probes , such as type - ia supernovae , weak gravitational lensing , galaxy and galaxy cluster surveys , and baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "most of these approaches rely on photometric calibrations over a wide range of intensities using standardized stars and internal reference sources .",
    "hence , a complete understanding of the linearity of the detectors is necessary . as part of a comprehensive program to study hgcdte detector properties that impact precision photometry ,",
    "we have studied flux dependent detector non - linearity .",
    "this effect was observed in the near infra - red camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst )  @xcite .",
    "the nicmos instrument , installed onboard hst during the second servicing mission in 1997 , employs three 256@xmath1256 nir detectors .",
    "these @xmath2 m cut - off hgcdte devices were fabricated by rockwell science center ( now teledyne imaging sensors , tis ) .",
    "this vendor also supplied the 1024@xmath11024 @xmath3 m cut - off hgcdte detector for the wide field camera3 ( wfc3 ) instrument @xcite , which was recently installed on hst during the final servicing mission .",
    "the @xmath3 m cut - off hgcdte detector used for the reciprocity study described here was also supplied by tis .",
    "the nicmos team concluded that the nicmos detectors exhibit a significant flux dependent non - linearity which strongly varies with wavelength @xcite .",
    "this non - linearity , referred to here as `` reciprocity failure '' , must be carefully distinguished from the well - known non - linearity of total signal , referred to here as `` classical non - linearity '' , which is observed in near infrared detectors that integrate charge on the junction capacitance of the pixels .",
    "classical non - linearity in nir detectors is caused by dependence of diode capacitance on voltage and non - linearity in the readout multiplexer , and is usually measured by integrating a constant flux for different exposure times .",
    "reciprocity failure in turn can be measured by varying the flux for exposure times that produce a constant integrated signal .",
    "the mechanism responsible for reciprocity failure is not yet understood .",
    "it has been suggested that image persistence in hgcdte detectors is caused by the slow release of trapped charge in the bulk material ( smith et al .",
    "it is conceivable that charge traps are also the cause of reciprocity failure . for a trap density that is small but not negligible compared to the photon density at low illumination levels , a small fraction of the signal",
    "would be lost due to the traps .",
    "an increase in the photon flux then will not result in a proportionally reduced signal , since charge is not efficiently exposed to traps with long fill - time constants . however , longer illumination at low flux levels could result in the filling of traps with long fill time constants and thus a reduced integrated signal .",
    "such a detector behavior would produce the observed effect : for a given total integrated signal a pixel s response to a high flux is larger than to a low flux .",
    "mathematically , reciprocity failure can be characterized by a logarithmic behavior over most of the dynamic range of a detector and the deviation from a linear system is expressed as fractional deviation per decade of total signal response .",
    "reciprocity failure impacts photometry as residual pixel - level uncertainties directly propagate to the estimated uncertainty on the derived magnitude . detailed knowledge of the degree of reciprocity failure for a detector will affect the calibration strategy and the calibration devices needed .",
    "a profound understanding of the cause of this effect could influence the detector manufacturing process , possibly reducing or even eliminating this non - linearity .",
    "to quantify reciprocity failure in nir detectors , a dedicated test system was designed and built . based on the measurements reported by the nicmos team",
    "it was determined that a sensitivity to reciprocity failure of at least 1%/decade over the full dynamic range of a typical nir detector had to be achieved . to measure reciprocity failure a detector",
    "was exposed at different illumination intensities , and the incident flux was precisely monitored with photodiodes .",
    "the exposure time at each illumination intensity was adjusted to integrate to similar total integrated signals .",
    "a parametrization including classical non - linearity and reciprocity failure was used to describe the data and to extract a measurement of the non - linearity due to reciprocity failure ( see appendix ) .",
    "knowledge of the linearity of the photodiodes is essential to this method .",
    "therefore , deviation from linearity of the photodiodes was measured independently as described in section[section_photodiodes ] .",
    "the experimental set - up utilizes a fixed illumination geometry .",
    "the illumination intensity is varied through a combination of neutral density filters and pinhole apertures , as schematically illustrated in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "a regulated light source placed outside the dewar is connected via a liquid light guide to a glass rod that illuminates a pinhole mounted on the aperture wheel inside the dewar . to avoid stray light entering the dewar ,",
    "the glass rod is surrounded by a bellows that attaches to the cold shield and the aperture wheel .",
    "the detector is illuminated by an integrating sphere , placed immediately below the aperture wheel , with fixed aperture and baffling .",
    "this produces an illumination profile at the detector that is independent of illumination intensity .",
    "the baffle tube , located between the integrating sphere and the detector , prevents stray light and reflected light from reaching the detector and keeps the illuminating geometry fixed .",
    "a set of six pinhole apertures at the input of the integrating sphere combined with neutral density filters at the entrance of the dewar extension allow a dynamic range in intensity of approximately @xmath4 to be covered . because all measurements are relative to the photodiodes that monitor the incident flux , knowledge of the exact area of the pinholes is not critical .",
    "furthermore , knowledge of the exact optical densities of the neutral density filters is also not essential .",
    "since neutral density filters can show spectral dependence , pinhole apertures were used to verify the spectral flatness of the nd filters utilized in the set - up at a level sufficient for the measurements reported here .",
    "the detector inside the dewar is illuminated by one of two light sources : a feedback controlled 50w quartz - tungsten - halogen ( qth ) lamp or alternatively a 790 nm diode laser .",
    "light from the qth light source is guided by a liquid light guide ( newport 77634 ) to a 70/30 beam splitter for feedback diode pick - up .",
    "a si feedback diode connected to the qth lamp control electronics stabilizes the qth light source .",
    "bulbs were changed frequently to avoid end - of - life fluctuations and spectral variations .",
    "a filter stack in front of the beam splitter provides for pass - band selection . depending on the wavelength selected for the measurement ,",
    "either a 900 nm long - pass filter or a stack of a 1100 nm short - pass filter and a 1000 nm short - pass filter ( to improve out - of - band blocking ) was inserted into the light path .",
    "the pass filter is then followed by one of four band - pass filters . following the splitter",
    ", the re - focussed light beam passes through a filter slide , housing a selectable set of neutral density filters with optical densities 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the connection from the warm optics into the dewar is made by a glass rod .",
    "light from the glass rod is then incident on the selected aperture inside the aperture wheel .",
    "the aperture wheel has a total of eight positions , six of which house pinholes ranging in diameter from 30@xmath5 m to 11 mm ( 30@xmath5 m , 100@xmath5 m , 330@xmath5 m , 1 mm , 3.3 mm , and 11 mm ) , one position completely blocks the light , and one position is fully open with no aperture ( @xmath613 mm diameter ) .",
    "the pinhole illuminates the entrance port of a 2-inch integrating sphere ( sphereoptics sph-2z-4 ) as shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "an optional short - pass cold filter ( asahi ysz1100 ) between two diffusers just in front of the integrating sphere is used for measurements below 1000 nm .",
    "the inside of the integrating sphere is coated with polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) based material providing good reflectivity at nir wavelengths and good low temperature performance .",
    "the reciprocity set - up was designed for measurement of substrate removed nir hgcdte detectors which exhibit spectral response at visible and nir wavelengths .",
    "two photodiodes , an ingaas photodiode and a si photodiode , were selected for good wavelength coverage .",
    "the nir photodiode is a blue extended ingaas pin diode ( hamamatsu photonics g108799 - 01k ) with an effective area of 0.785 mm@xmath7 and spectral response range of 0.5@xmath5 m to 1.7@xmath5 m . for improved sensitivity in the visible ,",
    "a si photodiode ( edmund optics 53371 ) with an effective area of 5.1mm@xmath7 and spectral response between 0.5@xmath5 m and 1.1@xmath5 m was used .",
    "the two photodiodes were mounted adjacent to each other to an open port of the integrating sphere as shown in fig.[fig : setup ] and were read out in parallel .",
    "the photodiode currents were recorded by two keithley 6485 pico - ammeters that were read out through a gpib interface by the data acquisition computer . for stable performance ,",
    "the pico - ammeter was turned on at least 1 hour prior to every series of measurements .",
    "typical photodiode currents were of order 1pa to 10na for the ingaas photodiode and 10pa to 100na for the si photodiode .",
    "an accurate photodiode current measurement requires multiple samples .",
    "this was achieved by operating the pico - ammeter in sampling mode and by averaging over ten such samplings .",
    "instrument drift during very long exposures was tracked by a reference photodiode and subtracted from the photodiode signal as shown in fig.[fig : photodiode ] .",
    "ingaas photodiode current as a function of time .",
    "the blue circles show the time averaged dark corrected current registered during a reciprocity measurement extending over 5 hours .",
    "the red squares show the same photodiode measurement corrected for fluctuations of the pico - ammeter . ]",
    "our measurement technique requires that any deviation from photodiode linearity be well characterized and corrected for . since",
    "precise linearity specifications were not available from the photodiode vendors , photodiode linearity was measured in our laboratory .",
    "we used a beam - addition method in which a small , constant `` test signal '' was intermittently added to `` base signals '' of varying intensities as illustrated in fig.[fig : diode_linearity_set_up ] .",

    "a 70/30 beam splitter following the stabilized light source extracts a constant amount of light , the test signal , that is attenuated and guided through a shutter into the integrating sphere .",
    "the direct light beam , the base signal , passes through an aperture wheel allowing to vary base signal intensities .",
    "a photodiode is mounted to the integrating sphere and , for different base signals , its response to the base signal alone and to base signal plus test signal is registered .",

    "] at different intensities spanning five orders of magnitude , and a power law model was fitted to evaluate the photodiode linearity . in order to cover five orders of magnitude in illumination , three test signals of approximately 9pa , 55pa and",
    "488pa were used as shown in fig.[fig : diode_linearity ] .",
    "the magnitudes of these test signals were fitted along with a power law exponent , resulting in a non - linearity of @xmath8%/decade .",
    "this non - linearity was later utilized to correct the detector response measurements , and its error was assigned as a systematic uncertainty .",

    ". a combined fit to all data results in a non - linearity of ( 0.08@xmath90.08)%/decade for the si photodiode .",
    "note that the error bars on the normalized test signals represent mainly the systematic uncertainties in these measurements , since the statistical uncertainties are negligible in comparison . ]    as shown in fig.[fig : diode_comparison ] , the _ relative _ linearity of the si and ingaas photodiodes is better than 0.1% over the dynamic range of illumination and wavelength used during the reciprocity measurements .",
    "this agreement gives us confidence that the absolute linearity of the ingaas photodiode is also of the order of 0.1%/decade , which is consistent with previous linearity studies of si and ingaas photodiodes @xcite .",

    "reciprocity failure in nir devices was characterized at a baseline temperature of 140k in an 8-inch dewar manufactured by ir labs .",
    "the hold time of the system is typically 6 to 8hours , longer than the longest sampling sequence which takes about 5hours to complete .",
    "this guarantees that measurements are not disrupted by the liquid nitrogen refill process . for all measurements",
    ", the nir detector was mounted to a fixed copper heater plate which is weakly thermally coupled to the liquid nitrogen reservoir and thermally stabilized to 10mk .",
    "the cool - down and warm - up ramp of 1k / min as well as temperature stabilization of the nir detectors at the operating temperature was controlled and monitored by a precision temperature controller ( lakeshore 330 ) . with the temperature of the detector held constant at @xmath10k",
    ", the illumination system inside the dewar was allowed to cool down to below @xmath11k at the integrating sphere over a time period of about 8 hours .",
    "this is much colder than required to suppress thermal background radiation in the @xmath3 m detector material .",
    "a second temperature control loop was used to eliminate temperature dependence in the response of the two photodiodes , which were always temperature stabilized at @xmath12k .      for detector",
    "read - out and control , a commercially available data acquisition system from astronomical research cameras ( arc ) was used . in this system ,",
    "32 channels of parallel read - out are available from four 8-channel infrared video processor boards combined with clock driver boards and a 250mhz timing and pci card .",
    "this read - out electronics is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "data are stored in fits format for subsequent analysis . in the current set - up",
    "no shutter was employed and thus each detector pixel starts to integrate signal immediately after reset .",
    "consequently , the shortest `` illumination time '' is determined by the amount of time it takes to read the array .",
    "in the default clocking mode ( 100khz ) the read - out of the whole array takes 1.418 seconds . to reduce the illumination time , only a partial strip of the detector , 300@xmath12048 pixels was read out for most of the measurements .",
    "this decreased the read - out time to 211 milliseconds .",
    "several detector characteristics depend on the bias voltage settings ; the full integration capacity for instance is a function of the reset voltage .",
    "all measurements reported here were performed with bias settings that were established to optimize low noise performance .",
    "the following voltages were applied : detector substrate voltage dsub=0.35v , reset voltage vreset=0.10v , pixel source follower bias voltage vbiasgate=2.45v , and pixel source follower source voltage vbiaspower=3.23v .",
    "following the discovery of dark energy in 1998 , one of the earliest experiments put forward to investigate the mysterious new property of the universe was the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) , a space - based telescope with a large wide field imager comprised of ccd and nir detectors .",
    "the project pursued a strong detector procurement and development program for 1.7@xmath5 m hgcdte focal plane arrays ( fpas ) with the goal of producing a low read - noise , high quantum efficiency ( qe ) device suitable for the proposed instrument @xcite .",
    "several lots were produced by tis , with fabrication based on the wfc3 development of 1k@xmath11k hgcdte material .",
    "low read - noise and dark current , high qe as well as substrate removal were addressed during different material growth runs .",
    "one of the devices procured from tis , h2rg-102 , an engineering grade 2k@xmath12k 1.7@xmath5 m cut - off detector mounted on a molybdenum pedestal was characterized with our reciprocity set - up .",
    "this fpa is a hybridized detector consisting of a highly integrated cmos multiplexer and a layer of infrared sensitive detector material .",
    "photon conversion takes place in a very thin layer of hgcdte , about 5 to 10@xmath5 m thick ( typically grown on a much thicker substrate layer ) with metallized contact pads defining the active area .",
    "the accumulation of photogenerated electron - hole pairs on the junction capacitance of the pixel causes a decrease in reverse bias which is sensed by a mosfet source follower .",
    "the multiplexer is an array of discrete read - out transistors and , unlike a conventional ccd , can be read non - destructively . detector layer and multiplexer are indium bump - bonded and mounted to a pedestal which equilibrates the temperature across the fpa .",
    "many challenges had to be overcome to achieve the 0.1%/decade sensitivity to reciprocity failure in our system .",
    "initial testing of the set - up indicated that it suffered from light leaks .",
    "the cryogenic ports identified as the source of the leaks were shielded , and the internal baffling system was extended to fully cover the detector to eliminate stray light in the system .",
    "the drifts in the photodiode readout affecting low illumination measurements were first reduced with better cable shielding and grounding , and finally corrected for in the analysis using the signal from a reference photodiode .",
    "it was noticed that dark images ( where the aperture was closed ) were brighter when the lamp was on than when it was off .",
    "this was caused by the light heating the aperture mounts causing them to glow in the nir .",
    "it was mitigated by facing the reflective side of the mounts towards the light and by using a cold short - pass filter between the apertures and the integrating sphere for measurements below 1000 nm . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "matched dark images were taken with the lamp on to allow a complete subtraction of this small dark glow .",
    "one of the greatest challenges involved the spectral mismatch of the detector and photodiode responses .",
    "the comparison of the signals from both , the si and ingaas photodiodes indicated that the pass - band filters leaked in the red .",
    "this was confirmed using a single wavelength laser .",
    "either short - pass or long - pass filters were placed in the light path to improve out - of - band rejection .",
    "monitoring photodiode signal ratios also confirmed that the neutral density filters used were spectrally flat to better than 0.1% in the region we operated .",
    "this was not the case for other neutral density filters we checked .",
    "using apertures instead of neutral density filters to control illumination avoids the spectral dependence issue .",
    "hence they were used as the primary means of illumination control .",
    "it turned out , however , that the integrating sphere used was not large enough to fully wash out the image of the aperture at its entrance and therefore different apertures resulted in slightly different illumination patterns on the device .",
    "this was remedied by two layers of spectrally flat diffusers , added between the apertures and the integrating sphere .",
    "ultimately , the different but complementary means of attenuating the illumination , the apertures and the nd filters , and the different spectral bands probed by the two photodiodes were essential in reaching the required sensitivity in our measurements .",
    "a comprehensive reciprocity test was performed on device h2rg-102 .",
    "for all measurements the detector temperature was held constant at 140k .",
    "measurements were made with the qth illumination system at wavelengths of 700 nm , 880 nm , 950 nm and 1400 nm and with the laser at 790 nm .",
    "h2rg-102 is a well performing engineering grade device .",
    "the detector is substrate removed and has an anti - reflective coating .",
    "the qe is greater than 90% from 0.9@xmath5 m to 1.7@xmath5 m and the detector response extends far into the visible : at 0.45@xmath5 m qe is about 40% .",
    "the dark current and read - noise performance is good , with a fowler-16 noise of @xmath13 for a @xmath14s exposure at @xmath10k .    during a typical reciprocity measurement",
    "the detector was first reset then repeatedly read non - destructively in a procedure that is generally called `` sample up the ramp '' ( sur ) mode , with up to 200 frames read during an exposure . for every sur sequence `` matched darks '' were obtained .",
    "measurement conditions for the matched darks were in every way identical to the reciprocity measurement conditions but exposures were taken with the aperture closed .",
    "the integrated signal , @xmath15 , in the detector is parameterized as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the detector count - rate as a function of time @xmath18 , and @xmath19 takes into account classical non - linearity ( for details see appendix ) . as can be seen in fig.[fig : total_signal ] , applying this parametrization describes the observed behavior well .",
    "after the correction , the classical non - linearity for signals below 60% of the saturation level is less than 0.1% . exposed images and matched darks were then included in the fit procedure used in calculating the nir detector response .",
    "monitoring photodiode currents were recorded for each frame in the sample and corrected as shown in fig.[fig : photodiode ] .",
    "long exposures over several hours were typical at the lowest illumination levels of a few electrons / pixel / second at the detector .",
    "it was observed that at the most sensitive setting the pico - ammeter drifts at the 10% level .",
    "those fluctuations were tracked by a reference photodiode connected to a pico - ammeter and removed from the data . the residual variation in the current measurement",
    "is dominated by statistical fluctuations and the variance of the mean improves linearly with the number of measurements in the exposure .",
    "the si photodiode itself was found to deviate from linearity at a level of @xmath20%/decade , requiring a correction that reduced the photodiode signal by this amount .",
    "the uncertainty in the si photodiode calibration along with the ingaas to si photodiode ratios constitute the systematic limit of our sensitivity to reciprocity failure of 0.1%/decade .",
    "the fitted detector response is divided by the photodiode current resulting in the flux ratios shown in fig.[fig : rec_failure_102 ] .",
    "normalized flux ratios were obtained at different illumination intensities and at different wavelengths . at wavelengths below 1000 nm , current readings from the si photodiode and above 1000 nm",

    "initial measurements were performed on a 1.7@xmath0 m hgcdte detector ( hr2g-102 ) between 700 nm and 1400 nm which yielded a non - linearity due to reciprocity failure of about 0.35%/decade .",
