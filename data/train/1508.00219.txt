    "the modeling of lifetime is an important aspect of statistical work in a variety of scientific and technological fields . in this area ,",
    "much new univariate distributions have been studied in the statistical literature recently .",
    "interestingly , not much work has been done on the bivariate distributions mainly due to its analytical intractability .",
    "the two - parameter generalized exponential ( ge ) distribution has been introduced by @xcite and it has the following cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and probability density function ( pdf ) , respectively : @xmath0    the hazard function of ge distribution can be increasing , decreasing and constant , but it can not be bathtub shaped .",
    "therefore , @xcite introduced the generalized exponential - power series ( geps ) distributions by compounding ge distribution with power series class of distributions .",
    "the proposed class includes ge , poisson - exponential @xcite , complementary exponential - geometric @xcite , and complementary exponential - power series @xcite distributions .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the ge distribution to a bivariate distribution .",
    "the cdf of the bivariate generalized exponential ( bge ) with parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is given by @xmath5    note that the bge distribution has both an absolutely continuous part and a singular part similar to the bivariate exponential distribution reported in @xcite and the bivariate models proposed by @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compound the bge distribution and power series class of distributions and define a new class of bivariate distributions .",
    "it contains the bge and geps distributions and is called the bivariate generalized exponential - power series ( bgeps ) distributions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec.class ]",
    ", we introduce the bgeps model and obtain some properties of this new family .",
    "some special models are studied in detail in section [ sec.spe ] .",
    "we propose an em algorithm to estimate the model parameters in section [ sec.est ] .",
    "a real data application of the bgeps distributions is illustrated in section [ sec.exa ] .",
    "a random variable @xmath6 follows the power series distribution if it has the following probability mass function @xmath7 where @xmath8 depends only on @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 can be @xmath13 ) is such that @xmath14 is finite .",
    "table [ tab.ps ] lists some particular cases of the truncated ( at zero ) power series distributions ( geometric , poisson , logarithmic , binomial and negative binomial ) .",
    "detailed properties of power series distribution can be found in @xcite . here , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "denote the first , second and third derivatives of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath18 , respectively .       for choosing the best value for @xmath19 in bgeb distribution",
    ", we considered @xmath20 , and obtained the corresponding log - likelihood values for all models .",
    "the results are given in figure [ fig.liks ] .",
    "it can be concluded that the log - likelihood values increase when @xmath19 increases .",
    "but there is negligible variation for large @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the results for @xmath21 are given in table [ tab.ex1 ] .    similarly , for choosing the best value for @xmath19 in bgenb distribution",
    ", we consider @xmath22 .",
    "the results are given in figure [ fig.liks ] .",
    "it can be concluded that the largest log - likelihood value occurs in the case of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we present the results for @xmath23 in table [ tab.ex1 ] .    for each fitted model , the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , the corrected akaike information criterion ( aicc ) and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) are calculated .",
    "we also obtain the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) distances between the fitted distribution and the empirical distribution function and the corresponding p - values ( in brackets ) for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ."
