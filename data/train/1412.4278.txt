    "our modification differs from the classical setting in the following aspects . on the one hand , as mentioned above , we do not take into account the reducing of mass in the equation for velocity , which simplifies the dynamics . on the other hand , we admit the presence of the gravity force together with a general nonlinear resistance and do not require the velocity to be nonnegative . to our knowledge ,",

    "note that since the admissible control set in problem ( 1 ) is convex and compact , and the dynamics is linear in @xmath20 the classical filippov theorem guarantees that a solution ( an optimal trajectory ) always exists .    to find an optimal trajectory , we , first of all , establish some properties of the control system @xmath21    define @xmath22 and @xmath23 from the conditions -(x_min)-g=0 , 1-(x_max ) - g = 0 , respectively .",
