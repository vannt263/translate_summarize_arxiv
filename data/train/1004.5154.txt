    "high energy neutrinos with different flavor ratios can be produced from various astrophysical environments or production processes .",
    "for instance , a typical hadronic interaction produces neutrinos through @xmath4 decay chains and generates a neutrino flavor ratio , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this type of source shall be referred to as pion source hereafter .",
    "when the source is hidden behind a strong field @xcite or a dense matter @xcite , the muon produced by the pion decay may lose a significant amount of its energy before its decay @xcite .",
    "this type of source is referred to as muon - damped source since the neutrinos produced by the decay of secondary muon give negligible contribution to the total neutrino flux .",
    "hence the resulting neutrino flavor ratio is @xmath6 .",
    "the flavor ratio of neutrinos are altered by oscillation effects while neutrinos propagate from the source to the detector on the earth .",
    "since the distance from an astrophysical source to the earth is generally much longer than the neutrino oscillation length , the observed neutrino flavor ratio is fully determined by three neutrino mixing angles and the cp phase . in this work",
    ", we aim to reconstruct the neutrino flavor ratio at the source from the observed flavor ratio on the earth .",
    "as we shall see later , the method for such a reconstruction depends on the neutrino energies .",
    "we shall focus our discussion on the highest energy regime , which is an extension to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "neutrinos interact with matters to produce observable signals .",
    "the major channel for such interactions is the charged - current ( cc ) interaction , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lepton associated with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the hadronic states .",
    "the sub - dominant channel is the neutral - current interaction ( nc ) , @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : trackandshower ] and table  [ tab : behave ] , we summarize different types of neutrino induced events and their detectable energy ranges .",

[ fig : trackandshower ] is an electron production through @xmath19 cc interaction . the electron has a large interaction cross section with the medium and produces a shower within a short distance from its production point .",
    "type - b event is a muon produced by @xmath0 cc interaction .",
    "contrary to the electron , a muon can travel a long distance in the medium before it loses all its energy or decays .",
    "the muon range in ice is more than @xmath20 km for @xmath21 pev ( @xmath22 ev ) .",
    "hence , above this energy , there is hardly any decay of muon occurring within the fiducial volume of the detector , which is about a few km@xmath23 .",
    "a muon does , however , lose a small fraction of its energy and emits dim lights so that only those optical detectors which are near to the muon track can be triggered . as a result , a muon produces a track - like signal .",
    "the @xmath1-induced events are listed as types c - g where the tau lepton produced by @xmath1 cc interaction behaves differently at different energies for a fixed detector design . for a neutrino telescope such as icecube @xcite ,",
    "the distance between each string of optical detectors is 125 m , which corresponds to the decay length of a @xmath24 pev tau lepton .",
    "such a tau lepton could be produced by the cc interaction of a @xmath1 with @xmath25 pev .",
    "therefore , for a @xmath1 with an energy significantly smaller than this , the separation between the first hadronic shower produced by cc interaction and the second shower produced by the tau - lepton decay is too small to be resolved .",
    "such an event is classified as type c. for @xmath17 pev , one can resolve the above double - bang event ( classified as type d ) until the separation of two showers exceeds the effective size of the detector .",
    "such a size is estimated to be the sum of icecube dimension ( @xmath26 km ) and two extinction lengths of optical photons in ice ( @xmath27 m ) , which corresponds to the decay length of a tau lepton with @xmath28 pev .",
    "the average energy of @xmath1 capable of producing such a tau lepton is around @xmath29 pev .",
    "hence the configuration of icecube detector determines the observable energy range for the double bang event to be @xmath30 @xcite . for an under - sea experiment , such as km3net @xcite",
    ", the observable energy range for the double bang event is similar .",
    "type - e event is referred to as the lollipop event .",
    "in such an event , a high energy tau lepton enters the detector and decays within it , producing a track signal followed by a shower .",
    "the probability for observing a lollipop event increases with the neutrino energy , and it is about @xmath31 for @xmath21 eev @xcite .",
    "type - f event is the inverted lollipop which consists of a hadronic shower from @xmath1 cc interaction and a subsequent tau - lepton track .",
    "both muons and tau leptons produce inverted lollipop events and it is not easy to separate them .",
    "type - g event is a through - going tau - lepton track which is produced by @xmath1 cc interaction with @xmath18 pev .",
    "finally type - h event is induced by the neutral - current interaction .",
    "although our focused energy range is at @xmath32 pev , it is helpful to review the flavor discrimination in the lower energy ranges .      in this energy range",
    ", type - c events can not be separated from type - a and type - h events since the two showers in type - c events can not be resolved .",
    "hence one can only distinguish muon track event ( type b ) from shower events ( type - a , c and h ) .",
    "in icecube , such a distinction can be done effectively @xcite , which is useful for deducing the flux ratio @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath34 in the numerator contributes to both type - b and type - h events . on the other hand , @xmath35 and @xmath36 contribute equally to type - h events if @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , type - a and type - c events occur with the same scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "this explains the flux combination @xmath38 appearing in the denominator .      in this energy range",
    ", one can detect the type - d and type - e @xmath1 events ( double bang and lollipop ) .",
    "hence it is also possible to deduce the flux ratio @xmath39 @xcite in addition to @xmath40 .",
    "however , the double bang and lollipop events are both rare so that the error associated with @xmath41 is large . in an earlier paper @xcite , we demonstrated that a large number of events is necessary for lowering down the errors of @xmath42 and @xmath43 to the point that one can distinguish the pion source from the muon - damped source .    . ]",
    ".flavor discrimination variables for different energy ranges [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this high energy regime , the tau - lepton range becomes long enough so that a tau lepton could pass through the detector fiducial volume without decaying . in this case",
    ", the tau - lepton loses its energy just like a muon does and the signal appears like a track event @xcite .",
    "thus , from an experimental point of view , one should classify such a signature as a track event ( type g ) . in this energy range , there are also type - e and type - f events where tau leptons also behave like tracks .",
    "it is clear that the discrimination between tau - lepton and muon tracks are challenging , i.e , it is non - trivial to measure the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "however , one can expect to measure the @xmath2 fraction @xmath45 by identifying the shower signature from the electron .",
    "in fact , @xmath2 can also be separated from other flavors in neutrino telescopes based upon radio detection technique @xcite due to landau - pomeranchuk - midal effect @xcite .    as a short summary , we present in table  [ tab : condition - set ] the appropriate flavor discrimination variables for @xmath46 pev and @xmath18 pev respectively .",
    "the evolution of neutrino flavor ratio from the source to the earth is given by the probability matrix @xmath47 such that @xmath48 each matrix element @xmath47 is a function of neutrino mixing angles and cp violation phase , @xmath49 is the flux of neutrinos of flavor @xmath50 on the earth , and @xmath51 is the flux of neutrinos of flavor @xmath52 at the source .",
