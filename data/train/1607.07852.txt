    "electron spins in double quantum dots ( dqds ) in the spin - blockade regime , with one or two electrons confined in each dot , have been proposed as qubits for quantum computing implementations at the nanoscale .",
    "@xcite from both theoretical and experimental points of view , the coherent control of these spin qubits has become a subject of great interest in the condensed matter and quantum information communities . in particular , there is considerable emphasis on the study of their coherent dynamics and the limiting mechanisms of spin coherence in the presence of hyperfine interactions with the ensemble of nuclear spins of the dqd host material .",

    "furthermore , in combination with dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) techniques , which rely on traversing the @xmath0 qubit resonance via landau - zener ( lz ) detuning sweeps , a sustained magnetic hyperfine field gradient between the qds can be created for times longer than 30 min , thus allowing coherent rotations around two axes of the bloch sphere , an essential requisite for the implementation of universal quantum gates .",
    "@xcite    an important question concerning the limiting factors to dnp efficiency when traversing the @xmath0 resonance , is whether the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) could influence dnp transfer from the electron to the nuclear spins , and consequently affect the fidelity of the singlet - triplet qubits .",
    "@xcite in particular , a quenching of dnp has been observed when soi exceeds the hyperfine interaction , preventing an increase in the spin decoherence time in gaas quantum dots .",
    "@xcite recently , interferometry experiments have been able to probe the fast dynamics associated with @xmath0 transitions by correlating the outcomes of an ensemble of individual single shot measurements of the qubit state after lz transitions .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we provide further insights into soi signatures that could be probed by one - shot readout experiments measuring the singlet state return probability following a rapid lz detuning sweep traversing the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "we perform both numerical and analytical calculations based on a realistic model , accounting for the dynamics of the lifting of the spin - blockade regime via soi .",
    "we show that the signatures of soi are manifested in a frequency shift near the vicinity of the @xmath0 resonance , and detuning - dependent modulation of the fourier amplitudes corresponding to transitions between the singlet state @xmath2 and the triplets @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",

    "<S> these allow direct access to the spin - orbit interaction scales and are characterized by a frequency shift and fourier amplitude modulation of the rabi flopping dynamics of the singlet - triplet qubits @xmath1 and @xmath0 . by applying the bloch - feshbach projection formalism , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate analytically that the aforementioned effects originate from the interplay between spin - orbit interaction and processes driven by the hyperfine interaction between the electron spins and those of the gaas nuclei . </S>"
