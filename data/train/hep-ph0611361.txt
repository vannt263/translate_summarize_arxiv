    "quantum mechanical meson - antimeson oscillations are sensitive to heavy degrees of freedom which propagate in the underlying mixing amplitudes .",
    "comparing observed meson mixing with predictions of the standard model ( sm ) , modern experimental studies would be able to constrain models of new physics ( np ) . yet , extensive precission data from b - factories and the tevatron collider show that the large sm mixing succesfully describes all available experimental data in @xmath1 and @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "the only flavor oscillation not yet observed is that of the charmed meson @xmath3 , where sm mixing is very small and the np component can stand out .",
    "this situation is an exact opposite to what happens in the @xmath4 system , where @xmath5 mixing measurements are used to constrain top quark couplings .",
    "together with the one loop standard model effects@xcite np effects can contribute to @xmath6 ( decays ) or @xmath7 ( mixing ) transitions . in the case of @xmath0 mixing",
    "these operators generate contributions to the effective operators that change @xmath3 state into @xmath8 state , leading to the mass eigenstates @xmath9 where the complex parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are obtained from diagonalizing the @xmath12 mass matrix .",
    "note that @xmath13 .",
    "if cp - violation in mixing is neglected , @xmath10 becomes equal to @xmath11 , so @xmath14 become @xmath15 eigenstates , @xmath16 .",
    "the mass and width splittings between these eigenstates are given by @xmath17 it is known experimentally that @xmath0 mixing proceeds extremely slowly , which in the standard model is usually attributed to the absence of superheavy quarks destroying gim cancellations .",
    "* semileptonic decays . *",
    "the most natural way to search for charm mixing is to employ semileptonic decays .",
    "it is also not the most sensivite way , as it is only sensitive to @xmath18 , a quadratic function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "use of the @xmath3 semileptonic decays for the mixing search involves the measurement of the time - dependent or time - integrated rate for the wrong - sign ( ws ) decays of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , relative to the right - sign ( rs ) decay rate , @xmath23 .",
    "* nonleptonic decays to non - cp eigenstates . *",
    "currently the most stringent limits on the @xmath3 mixing parameters arise from the decay time dependent @xmath24 measurements .",

    "a direct extraction of @xmath19 and @xmath20 from eq .  ( [ kpi ] ) is not possible due to unknown relative strong phase @xmath29 of dcs and cf amplitudes , as @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",

    "this measurement requires precise determination of lifetimes .",
    "* quantum - correlated final states . *",
    "the construction of tau - charm factories introduces new _ time - independent _ methods that are sensitive to a linear function of @xmath20 .",
    "one can use the fact that heavy meson pairs produced in the decays of heavy quarkonium resonances have the useful property that the two mesons are in the cp - correlated states@xcite .",
    "for instance , by tagging one of the mesons as a cp eigenstate , a lifetime difference may be determined by measuring the leptonic branching ratio of the other meson .",
    "the final states reachable by neutral charmed mesons are determined by a set of selection rules according to the initial virtual photon quantum numbers @xmath40@xcite .",
    "since we know whether this @xmath41 state is tagged as a ( cp - eigenstate ) @xmath42 from the decay of @xmath43 to a final state @xmath44 of definite cp - parity @xmath45 , we can easily determine @xmath20 in terms of the semileptonic branching ratios of @xmath42 , which we denote @xmath46 . neglecting small cp - violating effects ,",

    "the current experimental upper bounds on @xmath19 and @xmath20 are on the order of a few times @xmath49 , and are expected to improve in the coming years . to regard a future discovery of nonzero @xmath19 or @xmath20 as a signal for new physics",

    "[ fig : ddmixsm ] ) .",
    "roughly , there are two approaches , neither of which give very reliable results because @xmath54 is in some sense intermediate between heavy and light . the `` inclusive '' approach is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) . in the @xmath55 limit , where @xmath56 is a scale characteristic of the strong interactions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be expanded in terms of matrix elements of local operators@xcite .",
    "such calculations typically yield @xmath59 .",
    "the use of the ope relies on local quark - hadron duality , and on @xmath60 being small enough to allow a truncation of the series after the first few terms .",
    "the charm mass may not be large enough for these to be good approximations , especially for nonleptonic @xmath21 decays .",
    "an observation of @xmath20 of order @xmath61 could be ascribed to a breakdown of the ope or of duality , but such a large value of @xmath20 is certainly not a generic prediction of ope analyses .",
    "the `` exclusive '' approach sums over intermediate hadronic states , which may be modeled or fit to experimental data@xcite .",
    "since there are cancellations between states within a given @xmath62 multiplet , one needs to know the contribution of each state with high precision .",
    "however , the @xmath21 is not light enough that its decays are dominated by a few final states . in the absence of sufficiently precise data on many decay rates and on strong phases ,",
    "one is forced to use some assumptions . while most studies find @xmath59 , refs .",
    "[ ] obtain @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the @xmath61 level by arguing that su(3)@xmath50 violation is of order unity .",
    "it was also shown that phase space effects alone provide enough su(3)@xmath50 violation to induce @xmath63  [ ] .",
    "large effects in @xmath20 appear for decays close to @xmath21 threshold , where an analytic expansion in su(3)@xmath50 violation is no longer possible ; a dispersion relation can then be used to show that @xmath19 would receive contributions of similar order of magnitude .",
    "the above discussion shows that , contrary to @xmath4 and @xmath64 systems , theoretical calculations of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are quite uncertain@xcite , and the values near the current experimental bounds can not be ruled out .",
    "as one can see from the previous discussion , mixing in the charm system is very small . as it turns out ,",
    "theoretical predictions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the standard model are very uncertain , from a percent to orders of magnitude smaller@xcite .",
    "thus , new phyiscs ( np ) contributions can easily stand out .    in order to see how np might affect the mixing amplitude",
    ", it is instructive to consider off - diagonal terms in the neutral d mass matrix , @xmath65 is the effective @xmath66 hamiltonian .    * new phyiscs in @xmath67 interactions .",
    "* since all new physics particles are much heavier than the standard model ones , the most natural place for np to affect mixing amplitudes is in the @xmath67 piece , which corresponds to a local interaction at the charm quark mass scale . integrating out np degrees of freedom at some scale @xmath56 ,",
    "we are left with an effective hamiltonian written in the form of series of operators of increasing dimension@xcite . realizing this , it is not hard to write the complete basis of those effective operators , which most conveniently can be done in terms of left- and right - handed quark fields , [ seriesofoperators ] h^c=2_np = _ i=1 c_i ( )  q_i ( ) , where @xmath68 are the wilson coefficients , and @xmath69 are the effective operators , [ setofoperators ] q_1 & = & _ l _ c_l _ l ^c_l , _ 5 =",

    "r c_l , _ 8 = _ l _ c_r _ l ^ c_r , these operators exhaust the list of possible contributions to @xmath70 transitions .",
    "since these operators are generated at the scale @xmath71 ( at which new physics is integrated out ) , a non - trivial operator mixing can occur if we take into account renormalization group running of these operators between @xmath72 and @xmath73 scales .",
    "this running can be accounted for by solving rg equations obeyed by the wilson coefficient functions , [ rge ] c ( ) = ^t ( ) c ( ) , where @xmath74 represents the matrix of anomalous dimensions of operators of eq .",
    "( [ setofoperators ] ) . a prediction for a mixing parameter @xmath19 in a particular model of new physics",

    "it is interesting to note that some models _ require _ large signals in the charm system if mixing and fcncs in the strange and beauty systems are to be small ( e.g. the susy alignment model ) .    * new phyiscs in @xmath78 interactions . *",
    "the local @xmath67 interaction can not , however , affect @xmath79 because it does not have an absorptive part .",
    "thus , naively , np can not affect lifetime difference @xmath20 .",
    "this is , however , not quite correct .",
    "consider a @xmath3 decay amplitude which includes a small np contribution , @xmath80=a_n^{\\rm ( sm ) } + a_n^{\\rm ( np)}$ ] .",
    "here , @xmath81 is assumed to be smaller than the current experimental uncertainties on those decay rates .",
    "then it is a good approximation to write @xmath20 as @xmath82 the sm contribution to @xmath20 is known to vanish in the limit of exact flavor @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the first order correction is also absent , so the sm contribution arises only as a _",
    "second _ order effect .",
    "thus , those np contributions which do not vanish in the flavor @xmath62 limit must determine the lifetime difference there , even if their contibutions are tiny in the individual decay amplitudes@xcite .",
    "a simple calculation reveals that np contribution to @xmath20 can be as large as several percent in r - parity - violating susy models or as small as @xmath83 in the models with interactions mediated by charged higgs particles@xcite .",
    "consider , for example , models that do not vanish in the @xmath62 limit .",
    "the two most common scenarios involve models whose low energy @xmath78 effective hamiltonian involves ( v - a)@xmath84(v - a ) and ( s - p)@xmath84(s+p ) couplings .",
    "for instance , susy models without r - parity@xcite would fit the bill . in these models",

    "d^0  . operators with a tilde are obtained by swapping color indices in the charm quark operators . using factorization to estimate matrix elements of the above operators and taking for definiteness @xmath94  gev , we arrive at @xmath95@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are also several reasons that some np models vanish in the flavor @xmath62 limit .",
    "first , the structure of the np interaction might simply mimic the one of the sm .",
    "effects like that can occur in some models with extra space dimensions .",
    "second , the chiral structure of a low - energy effective lagrangian in a particular np model could be such that the leading , mass - independent contribution vanishes exactly , as in a left - right model ( lrm ) .",
    "third , the np coupling might explicitly depend on the quark mass , as in a model with multiple higgs doublets .",
    "however , most of these models feature second order @xmath62-breaking already at leading order in the @xmath96 expansion .",
    "this should be contrasted with the sm , where the leading order is suppressed by six powers of @xmath97 and the second order only appears as a @xmath98-order correction .",
    "for instance , lrm provide new tree - level contributions mediated by right - handed ( @xmath99 ) bosons@xcite .",
    "the relevant effective lagrangian is",
    "_ lr=-  * v*_ab^(r ) _ a , i ^p_r d_b , i   w^(r)_+  , where @xmath100 are the coefficients of the right - handed ckm matrix .",
    "since current experimental limits allow @xmath99 masses as low as a tev@xcite , a sizable contribution to @xmath20 is quite possible .",
    "we obtain & & y_lr = - c_lr * v*^(r)_cs * v*^(r)*_us  , [ ylrm ] where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 are the sm wilson coefficients and the operators appearing in eq .",

    "as one can wee , small np contributions to @xmath78 processes produce substantial effects in the @xmath110 lifetime difference , even if such contributions are currently undetectable in the experimental analyses of charmed meson decays . coupled with a known difficulty in computing sm contributions to",
    "d - meson decay amplitudes , it might be advantageous to use experimental constraints on @xmath20 in order to test various np scenarios due to better theoretical control over the np contribution and su(3 ) suppression of the sm amplitude .    * new phyiscs and cp - violation in @xmath110 mixing . * another possible manifestation of new physics interactions in the charm system",
    "is associated with the observation of ( large ) cp - violation .",
    "this is due to the fact that all quarks that build up the hadronic states in weak decays of charm mesons belong to the first two generations .",
    "since @xmath111 cabbibo quark mixing matrix is real , no cp - violation is possible in the dominant tree - level diagrams which describe the decay amplitudes .",
    "cp - violating amplitudes can be introduced in the standard model by including penguin or box operators induced by virtual @xmath112-quarks . however , their contributions are strongly suppressed by the small combination of ckm matrix elements @xmath113 .",
    "it is thus widely believed that the observation of ( large ) cp violation in charm decays or mixing would be an unambiguous sign for new physics@xcite .",
    "charm physics provides new and unique opportunities for indirect searches for new physics .",
    "np can affect charm mixing in a variety of ways , mainly affecting both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as well as providing cp - violating asymmetries . expected large statistical samples of charm data will allow new sensitive measurements of charm mixing and cp - violating parameters .",
