    "@xcite , and the quantum generalizations of _ finite automata _ ,",
    "i.e. , _ quantum finite automata _ ( qfas ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the study of qfas provides a good insight into the nature of quantum computation , since qfas can be viewed as the simplest theoretical model based on quantum mechanism .    the so - called _ measure - many one - way quantum finite automata _ ( mm-1qfas ) , introduced in @xcite , is a kind of qfa model whose tape head is subjected to moving one cell to the right at each computation step , and measurement is performed after every computation step .",

    "incidentally , the so - called _ enhanced one - way quantum finite automata _ ( e-1qfas ) introduced by nayak @xcite can be viewed as a generalization of mm-1qfas .    just as the equivalence problem of the classical finite automata @xcite , the concept of  equivalence \" gives us a classification of the elements of the set of mm-1qfas over the same alphabet . on the equivalence issue of mm-1qfas , li and",
    "qiu @xcite have shown , with the help of the so - called _ 1qfa with control language _",
    "@xcite , that two mm-1qfas @xmath0 and @xmath1 over the same alphabet are equivalent if and only if they are @xmath6-equivalent where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the numbers of states in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and factor @xmath7 is the numbers of states in the minimal dfa @xcite recognized the regular language @xmath8 .",
    "incidentally , there exist some works dealt with the equivalence issue with respect to other quantum finite automata @xcite .",
    "however , the equivalence problem of e-1qfas is still open thus far .",
    "a more comprehensive survey on this subject is @xcite by gruska .",
    "we note that the method to the equivalence problem of mm-1qfas , attributed to li and qiu @xcite , is roundabout and somewhat complicated .",
    "therefore , the first aim of this paper is to present a much simpler , direct and elegant approach to the equivalence problem of mm-1qfas .",
    "we summarize our motivations as follows .",
    "( 1 ) as we know , the mathematical method is the essence of mathematics .",
    "the mathematician usually investigates the same problem with different mathematical methods and different concepts to fully understand it .",
    "this method can be followed ; ( 2 ) it is an interesting work of its own to find a more general method to address the equivalence problem for mm-1qfas ; ( 3 ) we want to know whether the upper - bound @xmath6 can be further improved . such considerations",
    "lead us to transform the word function of mm-1qfas defined in a  cumulation \" manner ( described in the sequel ) to another version which is in a ",
    "non - cumulation \" manner .",
    "then , we improve the previous upper - bound to @xmath3 by showing the following    [ thm1 ] let @xmath9 , @xmath10 , be two mm-1qfas over @xmath2 . then @xmath0 and @xmath1 are equivalent iff they are @xmath11-equivalent , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the numbers of states in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the e-1qfa model @xcite can be seen as a finite memory version of the mixed state mm-1qfa .",
    "thus , the approach to the equivalence problem of mm-1qfas also can be applied to that of e-1qfas . therefore , as our second aim",
    ", we utilize the above approach to solve the equivalence problem of e-1qfas , which remains open so far , by showing the following    [ thm2 ] let @xmath12,@xmath10 , be two e-1qfas over @xmath2",
