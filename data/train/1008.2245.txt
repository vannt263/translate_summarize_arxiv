    "many of the systems which motivate the study of strong electronic correlations display their most interesting behaviors when doped .",
    "doping introduces disorder , and the role played by this disorder is often unclear .",
    "high temperature superconductors are an iconic example .",
    "moreover , experiments are performed at nonzero temperature , adding another energy scale to the problem .",
    "the recent proposal of a many - body localization transition at nonzero temperature@xcite underscores the richness of this phase space .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the interplay of interactions , disorder , kinetic energy and temperature in a very simple system .",
    "the phenomenon on which we focus is suppression of the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level .",
    "this can be seen directly in measurements such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy and is also reflected in transport measurements such as the low temperature conductivity .",
    "disorder - induced zero - bias anomalies ( zba ) have been studied in many doped transition metal oxides including the manganites,@xcite the cuprates@xcite and the ruthenates.@xcite it has been suggested that disorder may stabilize the pseudogap in cuprates,@xcite and the temperature dependence of the zba in the manganites may carry information about the metal insulator transition.@xcite the form of the dos in disordered interacting systems is best understood in two limits : altshuler - aronov zbas in metallic systems with weak interactions and weak disorder,@xcite and the efros - schklovskii coulomb gap in the atomic limit.@xcite however , dos measurements on strongly disordered transition metal oxides are not well described by either of these pictures .",
    "a fresh angle on these systems was provided by recent numerical results for the anderson - hubbard model.@xcite    the anderson - hubbard model ( ahm ) is among the simplest models to combine disorder and strong correlations .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath0 @xmath1 for nearest - neighbor sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and is zero otherwise .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are the annihilation and number operators for lattice site @xmath2 and spin @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 , the energy of the orbital at site @xmath2 , is chosen from a uniform distribution @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we consider here an ensemble of two - site systems , referred to as molecules .",
    "it has been shown that the density of states ( dos ) of this ensemble displays a zero - bias anomaly ( zba ) generated by a mechanism unique to strong correlations.@xcite moreover , at zero temperature the parameter dependence of this zba shares many features@xcite with that found in exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo studies of the two - dimensional lattice@xcite in the limit of large disorder .    here",
    "we present the temperature dependence of the zba in the ensemble of molecules . in the atomic limit",
    ", there is no zba at @xmath9 , but nonzero temperature creates one . with hopping ,",
    "the @xmath9 zba is initially enhanced as temperature is increased , and then filled in , resulting in non - monotonic temperature dependence of the dos at the chemical potential , @xmath10 .",
    "we begin by outlining the features of the ensemble dos at zero temperature , to provide context .",
    "the nonzero temperature results are then presented and discussed .",
    "in general , disorder reduces the importance of kinetic energy relative to interactions , and in the limit of strong disorder hopping causes only minimal changes to the atomic spectrum . in the atomic limit of the ahm",
    ", there is no distinction between an ensemble of molecules and a lattice of any dimension . in this limit",
    ", each site contributes to the dos at , at most , two energies .",
    "if a site with potential @xmath11 is empty , it will contribute at energy @xmath11 , corresponding to adding a particle to the lower hubbard orbital ( lho ) .",
    "if it is doubly occupied , it will contribute at energy @xmath12 , corresponding to removing a particle from the upper hubbard orbital ( uho ) . and",
    "if it is singly occupied , it will contribute with half the weight at both of these energies .",
    "the resulting atomic dos for an ensemble of molecules is sketched in figure [ fig:1 ] at three different fillings .",
    "panel ( a ) is at half filling and the dos is symmetric with a high plateau in the centre and lower shoulders . in panel ( b ) , the system is underdoped , but the fermi level remains in the central plateau . in panel ( c ) , the system is further underdoped and the fermi level sits at a step edge .",
    "the transition from configuration ( b ) to ( c ) occurs at @xmath13 , and the fermi level remains at a step edge down to @xmath14 , below which @xmath15 .",
    ", @xmath16 and three dopings : ( a ) @xmath17 , ( b ) @xmath18 and ( c ) @xmath19 .",
    "labels indicate the ground - state particle number of the sites contributing in each region .",
    "l and u refer to the lho and uho contributions respectively.,width=3 ]      at zero temperature , the poles in the molecular green s function depend on the ground state of the molecule .",
    "for all ground states , the addition of hopping shifts the positions of these poles .",
    "the largest contribution to the zba comes from molecules for which ( i ) there are two particles in the ground state and ( ii ) the lho on one site is close in energy to the uho on the neighboring site.@xcite the origin of the anomaly can be seen as follows : while one of the two electrons in the ground state sits almost entirely on the lower energy site , the second electron is spread between the uho on this site and the lho of the neighboring site .",
    "this spreading reduces the kinetic energy of the ground state by an amount of order @xmath20 .",
    "transitions from the ground state are correspondingly increased in energy . that this causes a reduction in the dos specifically near the fermi level",
    "can be seen from the fact that this particular arrangement with two particles in the ground state can only occur when the alignment of lho and uho occurs near @xmath21 .",
    "note that this mixing specifically of lho and uho on neighboring sites is unique to strongly correlated systems @xmath22 .",
    "additional contributions coming from other molecular ground states have been explored.@xcite    we are motivated by a desire to understand the zba found in two - dimensional lattices.@xcite given that there is no zba in the atomic limit , a molecule is the smallest ahm system to display zba physics at zero temperature . in considering an ensemble of molecules",
    ", we can expect to capture aspects of the physics in strongly disordered lattices .",
    "because the ensemble of molecules has only short length scales , its behavior at low energies will differ from that of the lattice .",
    "focusing , therefore , on the width of the zba , we found when @xmath23 the width is of order @xmath20 and independent of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and doping .",
    "this is consistent with results on two - dimensional lattices for disorder much larger than the band width and @xmath26 .",
    ", @xmath16 and three dopings : ( a ) @xmath17 , ( b ) @xmath18 and ( c ) @xmath19 .",
    "panels ( d ) and ( e ) focus on the temperature induced zba at half filling .",
    "the ensemble includes 10 million molecules.,width=5 ]    figure [ fig:2 ] shows the variation of the atomic dos at three different doping levels corresponding to those in figure [ fig:1 ] . in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , small nonzero temperatures generate a zba .",
    "examination of panels ( d ) and ( e ) show that the width of the anomaly grows roughly linearly with @xmath27 .",
    "the origin of this anomaly is as follows .",
    "consider a site with a potential just above the chemical potential , @xmath28 . at zero temperature",
    "it is empty , and contributes to the dos at @xmath29 .",
    "when the temperature is not zero , the site will be singly occupied with boltzmann probability @xmath30 .",
    "this causes some of the spectral weight for this site to shift from @xmath29 to @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , for sites with energies @xmath32 just below @xmath33 , which are doubly occupied at zero temperature , nonzero temperature causes spectral weight to shift from @xmath34 to @xmath32 , again moving spectral weight away from the chemical potential .",
    "the effect of sites which are singly occupied at zero temperature is the reverse , increasing spectral weight at @xmath35 . in panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    "the contribution to the dos at the chemical potential from empty and doubly occupied sites is greater than that from singly occupied sites .",
    "therefore , a negative anomaly forms .",
    "in contrast , in panel ( c ) nonzero temperature increases the dos below @xmath21 and reduces it above , smoothing the step edge . note",
    "that although the width of this anomaly is proportional to @xmath36 , the energy scale over which spectral weight is transferred is @xmath24 .",
    "the states removed from the fermi level do not pile up at the edge of the anomaly , as they do , for example , in the kinetic - energy - drive zba.@xcite    as the temperature is increased further , all sites begin to have contributions at both @xmath11 and @xmath37 . in the high temperature limit",
    ", the maximum value of the dos is reduced from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , which is the noninteracting value .       with @xmath40.,width=5 ]",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the variation with temperature of the dos at the same three fillings when @xmath41 . in the high temperature limit",
    ", the dos with hopping is very similar to that in the atomic limit .",
    "each molecule has four poles of equal weight . hopping shifts these poles relative to their atomic positions , rounding the step edges in the atomic dos , but only slightly so long as @xmath42 .    at zero temperature",
    ", however , hopping creates a zba . raising the temperature",
    "initially adds the temperature - driven anomaly to this kinetic - energy - driven one .",
    "the magnitude of the temperature - driven addition to the zba is only slightly reduced from its atomic limit magnitude .",
    "this is because there is only partial overlap between the molecules responsible for the temperature - driven anomaly and the kinetic - energy - driven one .",
    "the kinetic - energy - driven zba comes from molecules in which one site potential is near @xmath35 and the other is near @xmath33 .",
    "the temperature - driven zba comes from molecules for which at least one site potential is near @xmath35 .",
    "this includes all the molecules responsible for the kinetic - energy - driven zba but also many more .    as temperature",
    "is further increased , the molecules responsible for the kinetic - energy - driven zba have significant probability of _ not _ occupying the special ground state which is lower in energy by @xmath20 . as a result , this anomaly fills in from the bottom up .",
    "the result is a very non - monotonic temperature dependence of @xmath10 : it first declines as temperature is increased from zero , due to the addition of the temperature - driven zba .",
    "it then rises as the kinetic - energy - driven zba is washed out . and",
    "finally it falls again as the high temperature limit is approached .",
    "these results may shed light on existing experiments .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] ( e ) resembles the temperature dependence shown in figure 2 of reference @xcite , showing the zba in lani@xmath43mn@xmath44o@xmath45 filling in when the temperature is increased .",
    "moreover , measurements on la@xmath46ca@xmath47mno@xmath45 have observed a zba the depth of which has a similar non - monotonic dependence on temperature.@xcite    in conclusion , we have explored the temperature dependence of the zba in the ahm in the context of an ensemble of two - site systems .",
    "we find a temperature - driven zba in the atomic limit .",
    "when hopping is nonzero , a temperature - driven zba enhances the kinetic - energy - driven zba at low temperatures , while at higher temperatures the kinetic - energy - driven zba fills in from the bottom .",
    "this enhancement of the zba at low temperatures is in marked contrast to weakly interacting systems in which the altshuler - aronov anomaly is weakened at any nonzero temperature .",
