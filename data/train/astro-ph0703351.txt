    "the x - ray  spectra of many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) viewed directly toward the central source ( e.g. , seyfert 1 galaxies ) show the continuum flux absorbed by numerous absorption lines produced by ionized gas .",
    "the lines are generally shifted to shorter wavelengths , indicating an outflowing wind .",
    "it is not clear whether this wind can also be associated with the line - of - sight material responsible for the optical reddening of these sources . to that end",
    ", the outflow would have to entail neutral- gas or dust grains along with the highly ionized wind .",
    "it is still controversial whether the winds are significant for the agncentral engine or for the host galaxy in terms of mass , energy , and momentum .",
    "it is possible that extreme outflows may even play a central role in cosmological feedback and in the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in order to address these open questions , it is important to develop reliable techniques to probe the winds and to perform accurate measurements of their physical properties .",
    "the x - ray  band is advantageous for agn  outflow studies not only because most of the outflow appears to be highly ionized , but also since the x - ray  band comprises detectable absorption lines from the full range of charge states : from neutral up to hydrogen - like .",
    "moreover , in most cases an x - ray  spectrum features several lines from a single ion , which helps to deduce ionic column densities from saturated absorption lines .",
    "the detection of many charge states of a single element is key to plasma diagnostics as it allows to model the distribution of ionization and to measure the total column density independent of assumptions regarding the relative element abundances . for this purpose ,",
    "fe ions are particularly useful as they form over several orders of magnitude of the ionization parameter , defined ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the ionizing luminosity between 1 and 1000 rydberg , @xmath8 denotes the hydrogen number density and @xmath9 is the distance of the absorber from the ionizing source .",
    "once the distribution of ionization is known for one element , the relative abundances of other elements can be measured by comparison . for the absolute abundances of metals with respect to hydrogen ,",
    "one still needs to utilize uv  spectra , as the energies of atomic transitions in hydrogen are too low to be observed in the x - rays .",
    "highly ionized k- and l- shell ions ( 1 - 2 , and 3 - 10 electrons , respectively ) of fe appear regularly in astrophysical x - ray  sources , either in emission or in absorption .",
    "the lower charge states of fe ( 11 - 26 electrons ) feature strong inner - shell absorption lines in the soft x - ray band @xcite .",
    "each ion can produce dozens of overlapping lines forming unresolved transition arrays ( utas ) .",
    "interestingly , iras  13349 + 2438  was the first source in which fe m - shell utas were observed @xcite .",
    "the majority of works on the x - ray  spectra of agn  outflows fit the data with a gradually increasing number of iso-@xmath10 absorption components , until the fit is satisfactory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . for high - quality spectra two or three",
    "ionization components produce a good fit . in this work ,",
    "we employ a more fundamental method , which tries to reconstruct the actual distribution of the column density in the plasma as a continuous function of @xmath10 .",
    "we call this distribution the absorption measure distribution ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the present method is similar in principle to that tested by @xcite and by @xcite , who assumed a power - law distribution .",
    "however , here we fit for the @xmath0 directly from the measured ionic column densities making no _ a - priori _ assumptions regarding its shape .",
    "iras  13349 + 2438  is a bright type-1 quasar ( @xmath11 erg  s@xmath12 ) at a redshift of z=0.10764 @xcite .",
    "optical and infrared observations by @xcite have suggested absorption of the central source by dust .",
    "x - ray  observations with _ rosat_@xcite and _ asca _  @xcite did not find a significant column density of cold material , but suggested the presence of ionized gas along the line of sight , perhaps with embedded dust grains .",
    "@xcite restated the difficulty to explain the optical and x - ray  observations with the same absorber .",
    "the line - resolved rgs  ( reflection grating spectrometer on board _ xmm - newton _ ) spectrum of iras  13349 + 2438  measured by @xcite revealed broad ( fwhm  @xmath13 300 km  s@xmath12 ) absorption lines of many ions .",

    ", we revisit the ionized absorber of iras  13349 + 2438  using a long exposure with the high energy transmission grating ( hetgs ) spectrometer on board _ chandra _  performed 3 years and 9 months after the _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "the spectral resolution of hetgs  is much better than that of the rgs  and the long exposure compensates for its inferior effective area .",

    "no background subtraction was required as the backdround level was negligible .",
    "the post - pipeline procedure is similar to the method reported in @xcite .",
    "flux spectra were obtained by dividing the count spectra by the effective area curves produced by the standard ciao tool .",
    "positive and negative first - order data of both the meg and heg instruments were combined .",
    "the spectrum was corrected for neutral galactic absorption ( @xmath1 = 1.1@xmath18 @xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "the data were rebinned to 36  m  bins to improve the statistics of the spectra with minimal compromise of the spectral resolution , as the meg instrumental line spread function is approximately 23  m  broad ( fwhm ) .",
    "variations of approximately 25% on time scales of 20  ks were observed during the 300  ks exposure of iras  13349 + 2438 . due to this low level of variability and",
    "since we are interested in the over all properties of the ionized absorber , henceforth , we use only the combined meg and heg full 300  ks spectrum .",
    "the present fitting procedure follows our ion - by - ion fitting method @xcite .",
    "first , we fit for the broad - band continuum .",
    "subsequently , we fit the absorption features using template ionic spectra that include all of the absorption lines and photoelectric edges of each ion , but vary with the broadening ( so - called turbulent ) velocity and the ionic column density .",

    "[ plotone ] we present a direct comparison of the two grating spectra from these two observations showing their over all similarity .",
    "it can be seen that the hard x - ray  flux is almost identical , while there is some increase in the soft flux .",

    "@xmath33 is the total ionic column density towards the source in @xmath4 .",
    "the photoexcitation cross section is given by :    @xmath34    @xmath35 denotes the absorption oscillator strength and @xmath36 represents the voigt profile due to the convolution of natural ( lorentzian ) and doppler ( gaussian ) line broadening .",
    "the doppler broadening consists of thermal and turbulent motion , but in agn  outflows , the turbulent broadening appears to totally dominate the temperature broadening .",
    "transition wavelengths , natural widths and oscillator strengths were calculated using the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recent and improved atomic data for the fe m - shell ions were incorporated from @xcite .",
    "the doppler broadening can be typically characterized by a turbulent velocity @xmath37 , although for very high resolution uv  spectra of agn  outflows , this approximation has been shown to be inadequate and velocity - dependent partial covering effects need to be taken into account @xcite . due to the limited resolution ,",
    "the present hetgs  spectrum of iras  13349 + 2438  does not warrant a more sophisticated analysis than the @xmath37 approximation .",
    "indeed , a turbulent velocity of @xmath37  = 640 km  s@xmath12 , corresponding to a fwhm  of @xmath24 1500 km  s@xmath12 , provides a good fit to the strongest absorption lines in the spectrum as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] for the fe@xmath38 absorption line at 15.01   .",
    "this specific absorption line is shown because it has a high oscillator strength of 2.3 and it is relatively unblended .",
    "the value of @xmath37  = 640 km  s@xmath12  is consistent with that quoted by @xcite .",
    "since the absorbing gas is outflowing , the absorption lines are slightly blue - shifted with respect to the agn  rest frame .",
    "the current best - fit outflow velocity is @xmath39 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "errors correspond to @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , found from the rgs  spectrum two velocity components , high- and low- ionization components with velocities of + 20@xmath41   km  s@xmath12 , and 420@xmath42   km  s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we find that a single outflow velocity of @xmath43  km  s@xmath12  actually provides a better fit to the hetgs  spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] , the centroid of the fe@xmath38 line can be seen to be offset from the zero - velocity position by at least six sigma ( @xmath44  km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "@xcite ascribed this line to the high - ionization component with @xmath45= + 20@xmath41   km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath46300 km  s@xmath12  blue - shift ( obtained by fitting _ all _ absorption lines in the spectrum simultaneously ) clearly provides a better fit to the profile of this specific line .",
    "we ascribe the potential discrepancy with @xcite to the superior spectral resolution of the present hetgs  measurement and to the large errors on the velocities of @xcite . if anything , the data in fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] hint at an even higher velocity for this specific line , which might suggest that there is some scatter in velocity between the different ions .",
    "however , this effect is too weak for us to measure even with hetgs  and henceforth , we assume a uniform outflow velocity of @xmath47  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "our model includes all of the important lines of all ion species that can absorb in the waveband observed by hetgs . in the present spectrum of iras  13349 + 2438",
    ", we find evidence for the following ions : n@xmath48 , all charge states of o , ne@xmath48  ne@xmath49 , mg@xmath50  mg@xmath51 , na@xmath52 , si@xmath53  si@xmath54 , 21 ions of fe , and ni@xmath55 .",
    "we also include the k - shell photoelectric edges for all these ions although their effect here is largely negligible . when fitting the data , each ionic column density is treated as a free parameter .",
    "a preliminary fit is obtained using a custom made monte - carlo fitting method applied to the entire spectrum .",
    "subsequently , the final fit is obtained for individual ionic column densities in a more controlled manner , which ensures that the fit of the leading lines is not compromised . the best fit model for the present spectrum of iras  13349 + 2438is shown in fig .  [ plotthree ] .",
    "it can be seen that the si , mg , ne , and fe l - shell lines are reproduced fairly well by the model .",
    "however , in the fe m - shell region between 15.0  17.5  , the spectrum is rather noisy and it is difficult to identify individual ions . for these ions , only rough estimates of the column densities can be obtained .",
    "note that some lines could be saturated , e.g. , the leading lines of o@xmath48 and o@xmath56 . in these cases ,",
    "the higher order lines with lower oscillator strengths are crucial for obtaining reliable @xmath33 values .",
    "the best - fit ionic column densities are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . for the most part , the column densities of the fe , si , and mg ions are of the order of 10@xmath5710@xmath58  @xmath4 .",
    "the column densities of n@xmath48 and the ne ions exceed 10@xmath58  @xmath4 , while those of the o ions reach @xmath24  10@xmath59  @xmath4 . comparing these results with those of @xcite",
    ", we find that the fe m - shell column densities are consistent .",
    "the present column densities for the o k - shell ions are much higher , while those of fe l - shell are much lower than those of @xcite . in order to understand this discrepancy",
    ", we went back to the rgs  spectrum and compared both data and models with the present spectrum .",
    "we conclude that the o k - shell column densities indeed did vary between observations .",
    "this can be seen even in our fig .",
    "[ plotone ] where features of o@xmath48 and o@xmath56 , marked by labels , are clearly deeper in the present spectrum , even though the soft excess continuum is higher .",
    "conversely , for all non - oxygen ions , we find that the present ionic column densities obtained from fitting the hetgs  spectrum actually reproduce the rgs  spectrum fairly well .",
    "other than o , we have no good explanation for the discrepancies with @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find a relatively high column density of neutral fe which may not be part of the outflow , as manifested by the l@xmath60 absorption uta  at 17.53   ( see fig .",
    "[ plotthree ] ) .",
    "if we use the solar fe / h abundance ratio @xcite , we obtain a neutral gas column density of @xmath61  @xmath4 , much higher than the galactic column @xmath62  @xmath4 .",
    "this may indicate the presence of neutral gas or dust in the host galaxy reminiscent of the @xcite finding .",
    "the column density errors quoted in table  [ tab1 ] were calculated by keeping an individual ionic column density fixed while performing a minimum ",
    "@xmath63 fit with all other parameters , and then requiring that @xmath64 for variations of that individual ionic column density , while all other parameters remain fixed . the more statistically rigorous method would be to require @xmath64 following a refit of the data .",
    "however , since we supplement @xmath63 fitting with a more controlled manual fit to the strongest lines , leading to a best fit that is not strictly the @xmath63 minimum , this method which involves automatic @xmath63 minimization is inapplicable here .",
    "nevertheless , our simpler method gives reliable upper limits to the errors .",
    "for the cases in which the relative error was less than 10% , we assume an error of 10% .",
    "the reason is that even for the most prominent lines , we do not trust the column density to better than 10% .",
    "conversely , when the relative error was more than 200% , we quote a nominal error of 200% . in these cases",
    "we believe the errors are not statistical .    in  [ sec:@xmath0 ] we need to use symmetrical errors . in order to get a reliable symmetrical error estimate",
    ", we introduced one more adjustment .",
    "we define a geometrically averaged error :    @xmath66    we use geometrically averaged rather than arithmetically averaged errors , since the geometrical average gives an average in order of magnitude between the two errors , which is the more appropriate value to be applied as a symmetrical error . for the full @xmath0 analysis ( presented in  [ sec:@xmath0 ] ) , we use the true asymmetrical errors in the manner explained below .",
    "the large range of ionization states present in the absorber strongly suggests that the absorption arises from gas that is distributed over a wide range of ionization parameter .",
    "the total hydrogen column density @xmath1 along the line of sight can therefore be expressed as an integral over its distribution in @xmath67 .",
    "we call this continuous distribution the absorption measure distribution ( @xmath0 by analogy to the emission measure distribution in emission - line spectra ) :    @xmath68    and    @xmath69    the relation between the ionic column densities @xmath33 and the @xmath0 is then expressed as :    @xmath70    where @xmath33 is the measured ion column density , @xmath71 is the element abundance with respect to hydrogen assumed to be constant throughout the absorber , and @xmath72 is the fractional ion abundance with respect to the total abundance of its element . here",
    ", we aim at recovering the @xmath0 for iras  13349 + 2438 .    as an initial approximation to be relaxed later , let us assume that each ion forms exclusively at the ionization parameter @xmath73 where its fractional abundance peaks . furthermore ,",
    "if solar abundances @xmath74 are assumed , the equivalent hydrogen column density can be calculated separately from each ion using the relation :    @xmath75    and placed at the position of @xmath76 on an @xmath77 plot . for this we employed the xstar  code @xcite version 2.1kn3 to calculate @xmath72 using the continuum derived in  [ sec : continuum ] extrapolated to the range of 1  1000 rydberg .",
    "the results for iras  13349 + 2438  using solar abundances from @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] .",
    "the ions pertaining to each element in the figure are connected by straight lines to guide the eye .",
    "the fact that the connecting lines of fe , si , mg , o and ne largely overlap on this plot implies that the relative abundances of these elements do not deviate much from the solar values . on the other hand , the relative abundance of n and na appears to be significantly above solar , although there is only one n and one na ion to show this result .",
    "the errors in fig .",
    "[ plotfour ] are those propagated from the @xmath33 symmetrical uncertainties as explained in the previous section .",
    "the distribution presented in fig .  [ plotfour ] is only a first approximation for the actual @xmath0 . for the real @xmath0 , we need to find a distribution @xmath78 that after integration ( eq .  [ eqamd ] ) will produce all of the measured ionic column densities ( table  [ tab1 ] ) . in fitting for the @xmath0 one must take into account the full dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath10 .",
    "we assume all charge states see the same ionizing spectrum .",
    "this is justified by the absence of significant bound - free absorption edges in the spectrum .",
    "all elements are expected to reflect the same @xmath0 distribution , due to the assumption that they all reside in the same gas .",
    "iron however , has a special role as it covers almost five orders of magnitude in @xmath10 , more than any other element . nonetheless , in order to improve the @xmath0 fit",
    ", we can use other elements as well . in order to incorporate the non - fe ionic column densities without assuming anything about the elemental abundances , for non - fe ions we use column density ratios . using a reference ion for each element ( the one with the smallest symmetrical errors )",
    ", these ratios can be written as :    @xmath80    since there is no _ a - priori _ physical argument for a specific functional form for the @xmath0 , we choose to use a simple staircase function ( fig .  [ plotfive ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of this form is the well - localized easily - calculated errors .",
    "a similar approach was used for emission by @xcite .    the fit is performed with our monte - carlo evolution program in which the only free parameters are the values of the @xmath0 in each log@xmath10 bin .",
    "the program receives starting values for each bin , then generates 5000 other @xmath0 solutions randomly in the multi - dimensional region around the starting point . for each solution ,",
    "@xmath63 is calculated and the lowest-@xmath63 solution is subsequently considered as the new starting point .",
    "this process is repeated until @xmath63 can not improve any more . in our tests ,",
    "the program always converged to the same best-@xmath0 solution for arbitrary starting values within five orders of magnitude ( higher or lower ) of the final result .",
    "this gives us confidence that the fit finds the global minimum .",
    "as this is an ill - defined inversion problem , the @xmath0 binning is driven by the correlated errors . at first",
    ", we use 10 bins in the range of log@xmath10 = 1.25 to 3.75 ( c.g.s . ) , assuming the @xmath0 is zero elsewhere .",
    "we then combine bins so that the range and number of bins are optimized so that @xmath0 bin values are inconsistent with zero ( to within 1@xmath81 ) , except in broad regions of @xmath10 in which the @xmath0 is persistently zero .",
    "the final number of bins ( i.e. , the @xmath0 resolution ) depends on the specific absorber and on the quality of the data , which can limit the bin size .",
    "the @xmath0 fit is obtained by the @xmath63 minimalization technique with respect to all of the measured fe @xmath33 values ( eq .",
    "[ eqamd ] ) and @xmath33 ratios of at least one other element ( eq .",
    "[ eqratio ] ) . in the calculation of @xmath63 ,",
    "the real asymmetrical errors are used so that when the best - fit @xmath0 overestimates an ionic column density , the upper limit error is used and vice versa . for non - fe ions ,",
    "the same rule is applied to @xmath33 , while symmetrical errors are used for @xmath82 ( eq .  [ eqratio ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 errors are calculated in each bin including correlations between bins .",
    "the @xmath0 in a given bin is varied from its best - fit value and the whole distribution is refitted .",
    "this procedure is repeated until @xmath83 .",
    "the fact that changes in the @xmath0 in one bin can be compensated by varying the @xmath0 in other bins dominates the @xmath0 uncertainties .",
    "this is what limits the number of bins and the @xmath0 resolution .",
    "@xmath0 in neighboring , excessively narrow bins can not be distinguished by the data , i.e. , different distributions produce the measured @xmath33 values to within the errors .",
    "a meaningful quantity is the integral of the @xmath0 up to @xmath10 ( as a function of @xmath10 ) since during integration correlated errors cancel out , which explains the small errors on the integrated column density ( fig .",
    "[ plotfive ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the next step is to estimate the element abundances relative to fe .",
    "this is done by assuming that the other elements are distributed in log@xmath10 similar to fe , or in other words , that the _ shape _ of the @xmath0 ( e.g. , fig .  [ plotfive ] ) is manifested in the column density distribution of each and every element .",
    "this is what one would expect for a chemically uniform absorber .",
    "indeed , the overlap of elements in fig .  [ plotfour ] seems to support this assumption . in order to obtain the abundances",

    "[ plotsix ] and [ plotseven ] , we include comparisons with the two - component model of @xcite and the three - component model of @xcite for the same ngc  3783hetgs  data set .",

    "it can be seen that all models avoid the region of the @xmath0 minimum between log@xmath94   1 and 2 ( c.g.s .",
    "units ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only the present method , that allows for a complete distribution , accounts for the full range of absorbing gas from log@xmath10 = @xmath461.25 to log@xmath10 = 3.75 ( c.g.s .",
    "we obtain a total ( integrated ) @xmath1 value of ( 4.1@xmath20.7)@xmath3  @xmath4  compared with ( 3.8@xmath21.0)@xmath3  @xmath4  and ( 2.0@xmath20.8)@xmath3  @xmath4  obtained by @xcite and by @xcite , respectively .",
    "note , that we use slightly different solar abundances than the other authors do .",
    "finally , the results for the chemical abundances obtained for both iras  13349 + 2438  and ngc  3783  using the method described in the previous section are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we include in the table only elements with at least two significant ion detections . in both agns",
    "the ne / fe , mg / fe and o / fe abundance ratios are slightly above or at about their solar value .",
    "the si / fe ratio is above solar .",
    "the s / fe ratio can be measured only for ngc  3783  where it is at its solar value . in general",
    "we can say that in both agns the metal abundances are approximately consistent with solar values .",
    "the extent to which we can describe the low ionization region of the @xmath0 strongly depends on the photoionization balance , which is highly uncertain at low-@xmath10 for two main reasons .",
    "first , the uncertainties in the dielectronic recombination rates of the low charge states of fe at low ( photoionized ) temperatures are well known to be severely underestimated in all codes including xstar ; see @xcite and recently @xcite",
    ". correcting these would shift the ionization balance at a given @xmath10 value towards lower charge states , which would result in a more compact @xmath0 not extending as far on the low-@xmath10 end .",
    "the other effect that could drastically change our low-@xmath10 @xmath0 is photoionization of the low charge states by the euv and uv continuum , which is only poorly constrained .",
    "for example , a softer continuum than we assumed here ( see  [ sec : continuum ] ) , would allow for more highly ionized m - shell charge states at a given @xmath10 value .",
    "consequently , it is important to understand that the exact position of the low-@xmath10 peak of the @xmath0 for both iras  13349 + 2438and ngc  3783  is only poorly constrained , and will depend on the combined correction for the dr rates and for the soft continuum .",
    "conversely , the total column density in this component as well as the existence of a minimum in the @xmath0 are robust .",
    "one explanation that comes to mind for the minimum observed in the @xmath0 of both iras  13349 + 2438  and ngc  3783  is thermal instability .",
    "if photoionized gas is thermally unstable at these temperatures , it would provide a natural explanation for the absence of absorption and for the low column densities of the charge states that form primarily at these temperatures .",
    "note that our @xmath0 binning is driven by the requirement for meaningful errors .",
    "consequently , we can not determine where the alleged instability occurs to better accuracy than the @xmath10 and @xmath92 regimes given above , as narrower bins will inevitably result in excessive @xmath0 uncertainties .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 distributions presented in figs .",
    "[ plotfive ] and  [ plotseven ] along with their similar minima are reminiscent of what is widely referred to in the literature as the two - phase models of gas in photoionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these models have been invoked for agn  most importantly to allow for the confinement of low-@xmath92 high - density clouds by high-@xmath92 diffused gas .",
    "it is important to stress that the currently derived @xmath0 is not a model .",
    "it represents a direct measurement of the ionization structure of the absorber that is more complete and more detailed than a multi iso-@xmath10 fit . to that end ,",
    "the observed @xmath0 minima provide direct evidence for a thermal unstable temperature region that can not be obtained from iso-@xmath10 fits .",
    "the observed minimum or two - phase structure can also be ascribed to two geometrically distinct regions along the line of sight , a high ionization region and a low ionization region , both which have their own gaussian like @xmath0 distribution",
    ". however , there are good reasons to believe that gas at @xmath5 ( k ) would be unstable as the cooling function @xmath95 is generally decreasing in this temperature regime @xcite . additionally , the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) for ngc  3783shows that this region is marginally unstable .",
    "the model of @xcite for ngc  3783  avoids temperature zones , which could be a result of thermal instability .",
    "interestingly , the avoided region at @xmath96 ( k ) is consistent with the present measurement .",
    "however , there is another region of avoidance in that model at @xmath97 ( k ) that our measurement does not show .",
    "the model of @xcite has a very wide unstable region at @xmath98 .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite find an absorption component in this temperature regime , as we do .",
    "as the regions of instability depend strongly on unobserved regions of the ionizing spectra , the theoretical stability analysis models have to be treated with caution .",
    "we have analyzed the thermal and chemical structure of the ionized outflow in the quasar iras  13349 + 2438 . using a new @xmath0 reconstruction method",
    ", we measure the distribution of column density in the outflow as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "we find a double - peaked distribution with a significant minimum at @xmath99 ( c.g.s .",
    "units ) , which corresponds to temperatures of @xmath100 ( k ) . using a comparison method of the @xmath0 derived for different elements we are able to estimate the relative chemical abundances in the outflow .",
    "we find that all of the abundances relative to fe are more or less solar . for comparison",
    ", we applied the same analysis to the excellent - quality x - ray  spectrum of ngc  3783 .",
    "we find a similar minimum in the @xmath0 and rather similar abundances suggesting perhaps that these could be common features in agn  outflows .",
    "we believe this minimum is due to thermal instability .",
