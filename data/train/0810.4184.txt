    "the sources known as magnetars ( see @xcite for a review ) , comprised of the observational classes soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , are thought to be young neutron stars with magnetic fields above @xmath7  g @xcite .",
    "why some neutron stars are magnetars ( having magnetic field decay as their primary energy source and usually emitting no detectable radio pulsations ) while others are ordinary rotation - powered radio pulsars ( with comparatively little x - ray emission ; @xcite and references therein ) is a fundamentally unresolved issue , especially since some radio pulsars have been discovered with field strengths comparable to those of magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) .",
    "the proposed explanations run the gamut from evolutionary sequences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and quiescent states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to differences in progenitor mass @xcite or magnetic field orientation and geometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed that an initial short birth period is responsible for the generation of the high magnetar fields through an efficient large scale dynamo , and have also pointed out that high magnetic fields can produce asymmetric neutrino emission at birth , resulting in extreme space velocities ( @xmath8 ; also see @xcite ) .",
    "such large velocities would also help explain the apparent offsets between some sgrs and their putative natal supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these results for magnetars , taken with the extensive investigation of rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , imply that the initial spin periods , surface magnetic fields , and birth kick velocities of ns all originate in supernova core collapse processes , and the physics of these phenomena are tightly interwoven .",
    "magnetars , by virtue of their extreme magnetic fields , may provide a direct probe of this interdependence .",
    "for example , if birth kicks are driven by asymmetric neutrino emission mediated by high b - fields ( a mechanism that may not be able to produce the highest kick velocities ; @xcite ) , then magnetars should have a population velocity much higher than that of the radio pulsar population .",
    "however , a more critical investigation of some of the claimed sgr / supernova remnant associations led @xcite to doubt many associations and to conclude that magnetars as a class had velocities @xmath9 , comparable to the radio pulsar population .",
    "such speculations were largely without concrete examination , as the velocities of magnetars are difficult to measure . as a class , they lack radio counterparts and",
    "so can not be used for traditional very long baseline interferometry , and their spin - down properties are too noisy for measurement of `` timing '' proper motions .",
    "this has changed recently , though .",
    "the first measurement of the direct proper motion ( and hence space velocity , with an assumed distance ) of a magnetar was the work of @xcite , who found a proper motion of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 at a distance of @xmath12kpc ) for .",
    "this was made possible by the detection of a bright , transient radio counterpart197 to constrain the proper motion , and found a much coarser but consistent result .",
    "] @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to further address this issue by trying to measure the proper motions of two magnetars ,  and . in the absence of steady or widespread radio counterparts",
    ", we try to measure proper motions in the x - rays : while 1e  2259 + 586  has an infrared counterpart @xcite and would also be amenable to a measurement using data at those wavelengths , we try to use a technique applicable to objects without infrared counterparts , although we anticipate infrared data being used to check our measurement @xcite .",
    "not only can our data provide valuable constraints on the velocity distribution of magnetars , but they can also potentially address associations between the magnetars and other objects ( supernova remnants and massive star clusters ) .",
    "such associations are valuable for the constraints they can place on the ages , distances , and progenitor masses of magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we discuss this in more detail below .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in   [ sec : sources ] we discuss the two targets of this analysis , sgr  1900 + 14  and 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "we then discuss the archival data and our new _ chandra x - ray observatory _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) observations in   [ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : xray ] , we present a detailed analysis of those data , along with archival data used to test our techniques and simulations .",
    "we present our proper motion measurements in   [ sec : pm ] , along with comparison to other similar measurements and the prospects for improvement . finally , we give our discussion and conclusions in   [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the third sgr discovered @xcite , sgr  1900 + 14  was identified as a persistent x - ray source by @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations identified the 5.2-s pulse period @xcite with significant spin - down @xcite implying a large dipolar magnetic field .",
    "the magnetar nature of this source was confirmed by the giant flare detected on 1998  august  27 @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that sgr  1900 + 14  could be associated with the nearby supernova remnant ( snr ) g42.8 + 0.6 , based largely on position coincidence and the possible association of a number of other axps and sgrs with snrs .",
    "however , @xcite called the association into question when they discovered a relatively young ( @xmath13@xmath14  yr old ) radio pulsar near both the sgr and the snr , and @xcite calculated a 4% chance of random alignment between the sgr and snr .",
    "this chance is even greater if one accepts that supernova explosions would naturally tend to be clustered , so sgr  1900 + 14appearing near snr  g42.8 + 0.6  ( and other snrs ; @xcite ) is not unlikely . if the association between sgr  1900 + 14  and snr  g42.8 + 0.6  were real , sgr  1900 + 14would need a significant transverse velocity to make it from the explosion site to its current location outside the snr s radio shell @xcite .",
    "sgr  1900 + 14  is @xmath15 from the center of the snr ( at approximately @xmath16 , @xmath17 from low - frequency radio images , with an uncertainty of @xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this implies a proper motion of @xmath19 or a transverse velocity @xmath20 , where the distance to the system is @xmath21  kpc , and the age is about 1@xmath4kyr , but the spin - down rates of magnetars can easily vary by factors of several @xcite , thus making the spin - down age an unreliable estimator of the true age .",
    "the distance to sgr  1900 + 14  itself is largely unconstrained . ]",

    "@xcite identified a cluster of massive stars , with several m supergiant members and @xmath23 other stars , about @xmath24 away from the sgr  1900 + 14 .",
    "this has been viewed as a much more secure association for sgr  1900 + 14 , since such clusters are rarer and it is much closer on the sky , and @xcite claim that the infrared ring found around sgr  1900 + 14  could only be powered by the cluster stars .",
    "the possible inconsistency between the extinction to sgr  1900 + 14  and the cluster @xcite may not be significant , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "this cluster is at 1215@xmath4kpc , so if the association is real then sgr  1900 + 14  is at a distance of @xmath25 .",
    "the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e  2259 + 586  was the first member of its class to be discovered , when @xcite identified it as an x - ray point source in the center of the snr that had coherent @xmath26-s pulsations .",
    "the association with the snr seems secure @xcite , as the positional coincidence is very good ( @xmath27 ) compared to the local density of snrs .",
    "based on interactions between the snr and regions with measured distances , @xcite find a distancekpc using the `` red clump '' method .",
    "they argue that ctb  109 could also plausibly be at this distance too , based on a reinterpretation of radial velocity data , but there are uncertainties associated with this analysis . ] of @xmath28kpc .",
    "we examined the _ chandra _",
    "archive for suitable observations of magnetars .",
    "we found data on sgr  1900 + 14  and 1e  2259 + 586  that we used for the first epochs of our proper motions studies .",
    "these data were taken with the acis instrument in the full - frame mode and with no grating , in contrast to many other observations of magnetars that use subarrays , continuous clocking , or gratings to get better timing or spectral resolution .",
    "we re - observed sgr  1900 + 14  and 1e  2259 + 586  with _ chandra _ , with the new data serving as second epoch observations to try to measure or constrain their proper motions . for the second epochs , we chose to generally replicate the first epochs in detector choice , aimpoint , and exposure time .",
    "one of the priorities was to detect as many other sources as possible besides the sgr  1900 + 14/1e  2259 + 586 : as discussed below , our accuracy is limited by the number and quality of the reference sources . in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] we give the details of both the archival observations and our new ones .",
    "note that the rotations of the new and old observations are in general different .",
    "for sgr  1900 + 14 , which used the square acis - i detector , this made no difference , but for 1e  2259 + 586  the reference sources changed somewhat between epochs , giving us a smaller set than we would have liked : see discussion in ",
    "[ sec : axp ] .",
    "our general analysis technique is to ( 1 ) measure the positions of a number of field x - ray sources ( `` reference sources '' ) common to both epochs ; ( 2 ) measure the position of the object of interest ( sgr  1900 + 14or 1e  2259 + 586 ) in both epochs ; ( 3 ) use the reference sources to determine a transformation between the two observations ; and ( 4 ) apply that transformation to the object of interest , finding the position difference ( if any ) between the two epochs that we can then convert to a proper motion .",
    "this generally echoes the techniques of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , although like @xcite we prefer to use many reference sources and not just a few .",
    "we must determine the best way to carry out each step , and assess the uncertainties associated with each .",
    "for this reason , we discuss each step at length below , in many cases using data from other observations and/or simulations to assess accuracy .    in the discussion",
    "below , we work as much as possible in the sky pixel @xmath29 frame .",
    "this is a frame constructed by the _",
    "chandra _",
    "event processing that rotates the detector @xmath30 frame to have @xmath31 pointing north and @xmath32 pointing west .",
    "while in general we prefer to stay in a frame with as little processing as possible , which would argue for retaining the detector frame , the continuous dither of _ chandra _  ( in a lissajous pattern with amplitude @xmath33 and periods of 707@xmath4s and 1000@xmath4s along the two axes ) makes that difficult .",
    "the conversion from detector to sky frame involves correcting for that dither , for the nominal orientation of the spacecraft , and for any other position excursions , but this aspect reconstruction is of sufficient quality that it does not limit our accuracy .      for our main position - finding algorithm , we chose the ciao task ` wavdetect ` @xcite , which uses a wavelet - based detection algorithm .",
    "this echoes the choices made by such large x - ray surveys as the _ chandra _  multiwavelength plane ( champlane ) survey @xcite and the _ chandra _  multiwavelength project ( champ ; @xcite ) . in those cases",
    "the algorithm choice was made for optimum source detection , with astrometry only as a secondary goal , but they did find that ` wavdetect ` produced the most reliable astrometry .",
    "we verified this choice by comparing the results of ` wavdetect ` , the sliding - cell task ` celldetect ` , and our own implementation of an interactive centroiding task that operates on the raw event lists , and found that ` wavdetect ` gave the smallest scatter in the various tests described below .    as we were not overly concerned with detecting every possible source or measuring such source properties as count - rate",
    ", we ran ` wavdetect ` on the raw level 2 event files returned from the _ chandra _  archive without any additional processing ( e.g. , exposure map creation ) , using wavelet scales of @xmath34  pixels .",
    "we did test whether removing sub - pixel randomization made a difference in the positions , and we find no systematic difference .",
    "however , the uncertainties reported by ` wavdetect ` are systematically low , especially for off - axis sources .",
    "we therefore investigated the uncertainty models used by the champ and champlane projects .",
    "independent of the analyses of @xcite and @xcite , which relied on ` marx ` ( model of axaf response to x - rays ) and ` saosac ` ( a raytracing code developed for _ chandra _ ) simulations of sources , we wished to see how reliable the position measurement and uncertainty estimation of ` wavdetect ` are .",
    "therefore we took a number of relatively long acis - i exposures from the archive with a large number of point sources .",
    "we then split those exposures into two halves by time , effectively making two sub - exposures that are otherwise identical , and processed each with ` wavdetect ` in the same manner .",
    "this way we can examine how the positions from the first half agree with those from the second half : since the two sub - exposures are from the same observation , the positions should agree .",
    "of course the sources in each sub - exposure with have fewer counts than the sources in the total exposure , but there are still a range of count levels and off - axis angles .",
    "we first did this comparing the results of ` wavdetect ` with ` celldetect ` and an interative centroiding algorithm that we implemented , and found ` wavdetect ` to have the lowest dispersion .",
    "we then varied the energy range of our source extraction and found that including event energies from 0.3  kev to 7  kev optimized the signal - to - noise of the extraction .",
    "we then compared the position differences between the first and second sub - exposures with the position uncertainties returned by ` wavdetect ` .",
    "we found that ` wavdetect ` significantly underestimated the uncertainties , especially at off - axis angles @xmath35 .",
    "the comparison gave a reduced @xmath36 of 4.31 for 1450  degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) , and the shape of the distribution is clearly broader than the expected distribution , with more points at @xmath37 . in contrast ,",
    "both the champ and champlane models work well , giving reduced @xmath36 values of @xmath38 and 1.02 .",
    "the uncertainty from the champlane model exceeds that from the champ model slightly at large and small off - axis angles , leading to the slightly lower @xmath36 for champlane .",
    "overall , both the champ and champlane uncertainty models appear to work .",
    "both are based on simulations using ` marx ` , and so the agreement is not surprising , but since they agree with each other and also agree with the actual data presented here ( see   [ sec : tform ] ) we feel comfortable using either .",
    "the functional form of the champ model is somewhat simpler and conforms more to the expected relation between uncertainty @xmath39 and signal - to - noise ratio , with @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the number of counts above the background ) compared to the expected @xmath42 ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) . in contrast , the champlane model is a more complicated function of @xmath41 involving powers of the logarithm of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore we will use the champ model ( see eq .",
    "14 of @xcite ) : @xmath44 with @xmath39 as the @xmath45 or @xmath46 uncertainty ( converted from the radial uncertainty in @xcite by dividing by 1.515 ; see @xcite ) , and @xmath47 in arcminutes .",
    "note that this is only valid for low count levels ( @xmath48 ) as is the case here but not for sgr  1900 + 14  or 1e  2259 + 586 .      for sgr  1900 + 14",
    ", we are in a very different regime than for the reference sources . instead of relatively faint sources at a variety of off - axis angles , we have a bright source at @xmath49 . a different approach to position measurement and uncertainties than that described in   [ sec : ref ] is needed .",

    "the spatial distribution of events is still largely consistent with the point - spread function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rpsgr ] ) .",
    "our ` marx ` simulations here did not account for pileup , but even so they were consistent with our examination of the sub - exposures of the real data .",
    "overall , then , ` wavdetect ` positions and uncertainties seem sufficient for observations of sgr  1900 + 14 .      for 1e  2259 + 586 , we could not use the results of ` wavdetect ` .",
    "the pileup for this source is severe enough that the x - ray image has a central hole , where so many x - ray photons landed that all were judged to be cosmic rays .",
    "we also have issues at large radii : beyond a radius of @xmath173 , there is extended emission from a combination of the snr in which 1e  2259 + 586  is embedded , as well as a halo from dust scattering @xcite .",
    "we initially tried doing simple centroids on the event data , where we used events in an annulus whose inner radius varied from 0 to 5  pix ( to eliminate the central hole ) and whose outer radius varied from 15  pix to 100  pix . for data with no central hole , iterating this process will converge on the correct center ( this was one of the methods we used in   [",
    "sec : magpos ] ) . however , we found that this method gave results that did not converge : changing the outer radius led to systematic changes in the centroid position .",
    "this was partially due to asymmetries in the extended x - ray emission , but more important were the effects of non - uniform exposure over the acis ccds .",
    "together , these effects led to variations ( both smooth and discrete ) of the overall count level over the image , and when the annuli that we chose included those portions , they skewed the resulting centroid . simulating the data in ` marx ` , where we used similar exposure maps , reproduced the wandering centroid , although not to a high enough precision that the ` marx ` data would allow us to correct the observations .",

    "@xcite used a hyperbolic tangent for their `` hole '' function : we found that this did not decline quite quickly enough to match our data , and instead used @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the radius scale and the exponent serves to increase the sharpness of the hole ; the results are not sensitive to the exponent as long as it is @xmath204 .",
    "a fit to the data from both epochs ( averaged in azimuth ) , along with a ` marx ` simulation that includes pileup , is shown in figure  [ fig : rpaxp ] . to make that fit",
    ", we fit the gaussian to the data , the ` marx ` model with pileup , and the ` marx ` model without pileup , all for radii of @xmath205pix . at those radii",
    "the data and the two models all agree reasonably well . within @xmath206pix",
    "the effects of pileup become more severe , and the ` marx ` model is not able to accurately predict the data , but the agreement is qualitatively reasonable .",
    "we found a hole radius @xmath207pix , but again the fit was not extremely sensitive to this value .",
    "the goal of this model is to give a good qualitative representation of the data , not to fit it in great detail .    to actually find the position of 1e  2259 + 586 , instead of fitting the data , which is sensitive to the details of the model as well , we prefer to cross - correlate a fixed model with the data .",
    "our fixed model is that shown in figure  [ fig : rpaxp ] : @xmath208 where we found @xmath209pixels and @xmath210pixels gave good results .",
    "this function is radially symmetric , and by cross - correlating rather than fitting we can ignore issues of normalization and the variations in the wings of the radial profile . above , we could have just fit the data to a gaussian function only for radii greater than @xmath206pixels , but this would not have allowed the cross - correlation . using a gaussian kernel function with no hole but just excluding a portion of the data performed poorly , since the sharp `` horns '' of the data outside of the hole can cause local maxima in the cross correlation if the kernel function has a single peak like a gaussian .",
    "we cross - correlated images of the filtered event files created from both the data and the ` marx ` simulations with the model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xcorr ] ) .",
    "the cross - correlation results were smooth and well - behaved , and we interpolated between our grid points to find the best - fit offset .",
    "we made sure that the fitted position did not depend on the details of the cross - correlation : we varied the binning , the outer radius , and the parameters of the model ( @xmath211 and @xmath203 ) , and in all cases the resulting variations in the position were @xmath212pix .",
    "as a further check , we shifted the event positions by random amounts of up to @xmath213pix , and found that we were able to recover the shifts to an accuracy of @xmath214pix ; this test also verified that our result did not depend on the origin of the binning .",
    "based on these tests , as well as additional ` marx ` simulations , we estimate that our cross - correlation is accurate to @xmath215pix in each coordinate .    as another test",
    ", we also cross - correlated the binned images from epochs 1 and 2 against each other , rather than against a smooth kernel . in general the results of this test were similar , where we could recover an input shift at a level of @xmath214pix , and the offsets agreed to a similar precision .",
    "we plot the results of all cross - correlations ( epoch 1 vs.  model , epoch 2 vs.  model , and epoch 1 vs.  epoch 2 ) in figure  [ fig : xcorroffsets ] , where we plot the results relative to the best - fit positions given in table  [ tab : refaxp ] .",
    "the cross - correlations that we plot do not agree exactly with the positions in table  [ tab : refaxp ] as those positions were derived using multiple cross - correlations with random offsets used to eliminate the effects of binning , but the agreement is better than the quoted @xmath215pix uncertainty .    for a final check",
    ", we examined the position of the readout streak on the two epochs .",
    "this streak comes about because the acis detector has no shutter , so the ccds receive photons even as the charge is being clocked off .",
    "this gives rise to a one - dimensional streak centered on each bright source which is aligned with the ccd row and column axes .",
    "it ends up having @xmath216% of the total number of events as the original source , and can be used for both positional and spectral information . here",
    "we make use of only the former .",
    "to use the streak , we took the event positions from the level-2 event file .",
    "we then rotated by the ` roll_nom ` header keyword , putting them into a frame where the ccd rows and columns were vertical and horizontal ( similar to the ` chip ` frame ) .",
    "the readout streak , which is a line in the sky ( @xmath45,@xmath46 ) frame not aligned with either axis , is now horizontal .",
    "we then stepped along the line , computing the median event position in the vertical direction for bins of @xmath217pix width in the horizontal direction : see figure  [ fig : streak ] . for both epochs 1 and 2",
    ", we found streak positions that were consistent to @xmath218pix with our best - fit positions of 1e  2259 + 586  from table  [ tab : refaxp ] , albeit in one dimension . while not sufficient to get a position for 1e  2259 + 586  alone , this provides additional confirmation that our cross - correlation technique is accurate to the claimed @xmath219pix .",
    "we considered a number of ways to transform between the position measurements at each stage . to test this",
    ", we used 13 acis - i observations of the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ; @xcite and subsequent papers ) .",
    "the observations were between 50  ks and 140  ks in depth , and detected @xmath220  sources .",
    "note that the observational setup here was , if anything , more taxing that what we used for our proper motion observations .",
    "this was because a number of the observations had a different aimpoint ( off by about half of an acis detector ) and varying roll angles .",
    "we identified 38 sources that were common to each exposure ( note that this was not a completely exhaustive search , but comprised those that we could identify easily ) and computed transformations between each pair of observations .",
    "we used a number of different transformations with different levels of complexity .",
    "2-parameter : :    : a shift in @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "3-parameter : :    : a shift in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , along with a    rotation .",
    "4-parameter : :    : a shift in @xmath45 and @xmath46 , along with a    rotation and an overall scaling .",
    "6-parameter : :    : a general linear transformation , involving a shift and a separate    rotation and scaling for each axis ( e.g. , see eqn .",
    "a5 in @xcite ) .",
    "we were transforming between @xmath45 and @xmath46 values in the ` sky ` frame , so the nominal position angle of _ chandra _  was already taken out . any remaining rotation or scaling would account for imprecise knowledge of the spacecraft s orientation and breathing of the acis - i detector ( changes in the plate - scale due to thermal variations ) , respectively .",
    "overall we found that the 3-parameter transformation provided a significant decrease in @xmath36 compared to the 2-parameter transformation , with a mean @xmath221 of 23.8 going from 74 to 73 dof .",
    "this is extremely significant , with an f - test probability of @xmath222 that this is due to chance .",
    "therefore a non - zero rotation is required between different observations , with a magnitude of @xmath223 . comparing sets of three observations ,",
    "the rotations @xmath224 fitted between all of them are consistent , with ( e.g. , ) @xmath225 , indicating that the rotations can be physically meaningful . with just the 3-parameter transformation",
    "the reduced @xmath36 was consistent with 1.0 , and the distribution of position residuals was consistent with the expected distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pdifftform ] ) .",
    "this indicates that our uncertainty model is reasonable : tests using the champlane model gave similar results , while those using the raw ` wavdetect ` uncertainties had reduced @xmath36 larger than 2 . beyond this ,",
    "the more complicated transformations were not warranted , with a median @xmath226 of only 4.2 between 3 parameters and 6 .",
    "to actually measure the proper motion of sgr  1900 + 14 , first we ran ` wavdetect ` on both observations .",
    "the parameters were the same as those discussed in ",
    "[ sec : xray ] .",
    "we then identified sources common to both epochs of the data , finding 27 sources in addition to sgr  1900 + 14 .",
    "these sources were on all four of the acis - i ccds .",
    "it would be preferable to have the sgr  1900 + 14  centered on a single ccd , and to only use sources on that detector . that way we would not have to worry about inaccuracies in the relative positions of the detectors or shifts in their positions with time affecting our astrometry .",
    "however , that would severely restrict our field of view , and we felt that the gain of additional reference sources outweighed the possibility of smaller uncertainties for the detected sources . the various tests and discussion in   [ sec : ref ] seem to indicate that using sources on different ccds does not adversely affect our astrometry , at least at the level considered here .    with the source detections , we then updated the position uncertainties of all of the sources except sgr  1900 + 14  using eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dposs ] .",
    "finally , we fit for the transformation between the two epochs of data , using a 3-parameter fit (   [ sec : tform ] ) .",
    "the data gave a very good fit , with @xmath227 for 51 dof ( 27 reference sources and 3 parameters ) .",
    "there were no significant outliers in the data , which is not really surprising since we only included sources that we could match initially between the epochs .",
    "the magnitude of the residuals is @xmath228 , which is far larger than the proper motion one would expect from random field stars ( i.e. , at 1  kpc @xmath229 is @xmath230 , which is much larger than the velocity dispersion of galactic stars ) .",
    "therefore we can consider that we are measuring the motion of sgr  1900 + 14relative to reference stars that are at rest .",
    "similarly , corrections for galactic rotation and solar motion are too small to be considered .",
    "the fitted rotation here was consistent with 0 .",
    "we therefore found that a 2-parameter transformation was sufficient ( with virtually no change in @xmath36 ) , and with the smaller number of free parameters the resulting position difference had smaller uncertainties . while in   [ sec : tform ] we found that a rotation was necessary , here we do not , although whether it is the simpler observational setup ( both observations had the same aimpoint , in contrast to ",
    "[ sec : tform ] ) or just the reduced accuracy from a smaller number of reference sources that changed the situation we do not know .",
    "we plot the residual position differences of the reference sources in figure  [ fig : refresids ] .    as a check on our transformation , we performed jackknife tests , where we calculate the transformation for the data excluding a single reference source ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this tests whether or not the transformation depends overly on a single reference source , and indeed we find that it does not .",
    "we find that the means of the jackknifed shifts are consistent with the value using all of the data , and that the standard deviations are significantly less than our estimated shift uncertainties .",
    "we then performed a bootstrap test .",
    "here we created 100 data sets , each including a random subset chosen with replacement from the 27 reference sources .",
    "the resulting shifts are again distributed around the proper values created from the actual data , and the standard deviations are comparable to our uncertainties ( they are actually slightly smaller ) .",
    "based on these two tests , we see that our transformation calculation is reasonably robust to choices of the input data .    with the 3-parameter transformation , we find that the position of sgr  1900 + 14  is consistent between the two epochs , moving by @xmath231  pixels , implying no measurable proper motion .",
    "note that the bulk of this uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the fitted transformation ( uncertainties in each coordinate of the shift of 0.26  pixels , and an uncertainty in the rotation of @xmath232 ) , since the individual position measurements of sgr  1900 + 14  had uncertainties of @xmath233  pixels .",
    "we also checked to see if the choice of transformation ( 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 parameters ) , uncertainty model ( champ or champlane ) , or level of processing ( with or without acis randomization ) made a difference , and find that all of the results were consistent . with the 2-parameter transformation , which as discussed above is sufficient , we find a very similar shift but smaller residuals : @xmath234  pixels , or a magnitude @xmath235  pixels for the 2-parameter fit . again , the uncertainties are dominated by the 0.18  pixel uncertainties in each coordinate of the shift .",
    "we give the detailed fit results in table  [ tab : pm ] .",
    "the interval between the observations was @xmath236 , so we have a proper motion in pixels @xmath237 .",
    "the celestial proper motion is @xmath238 , which is @xmath239 .",
    "if we actually want to limit the speed of sgr  1900 + 14 , we can look at the distribution of the magnitude @xmath240 .",
    "our measurements were @xmath241 and @xmath242 , although @xmath243 . if we look at the magnitude of the proper motion @xmath244 , where @xmath245 , the probability density function for @xmath246 is : @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the modified bessel function of the first kind @xcite . from numerical integration",
    ", we find that the mean , mode , and median are all close to each other . for sgr  1900 + 14 ,",
    "the mean is @xmath249 ( vs.  @xmath250 ) , and we find a 90% upper limit to @xmath246 to be @xmath1 , or a transverse velocity @xmath251 .",
    "l c c c c c transform @xmath252 & 37.8/52 & 37.7/51 & & 14.1/10 & 13.1/9 + @xmath253 ( pixels ) & @xmath254 & @xmath255 & & @xmath256 & @xmath257 + @xmath258 @xmath259 & @xmath260 & @xmath261 & & @xmath262&@xmath263 + @xmath264 @xmath259 & 26 & 26 & & 36 & 32 + @xmath265 @xmath259 & 33 & 39 & & 42 & 44 + @xmath266 @xmath259 & 54 & 69 & & 65 & 73 + @xmath267 @xmath268 & 780@xmath269 & 930@xmath269 & & 600@xmath270 & 630@xmath270 + @xmath271 @xmath268 & 1300@xmath269 & 1600@xmath269&&930@xmath270 & 1000@xmath270 +      we followed the same procedure as for sgr  1900 + 14  above to find the reference sources for 1e  2259 + 586 . here",
    ", though , we could only identify 6 sources common to both epochs ( a seventh source was identified , but it is right near the gap between detectors and the positions disagreed by @xmath272 between the two epochs ) . while formally enough to determine a robust transformation , this is fewer than we might like to have .",
    "one problem here is that we are using acis - s , which has a smaller field of view . here",
    "1e  2259 + 586  is close to the center of a ccd ( acis - s3 ) , and we used sources from both acis - s3 and acis - s2 . we chose to do the second epoch observation with acis - s as well , to best reproduce the first .",
    "there were some slight problems , though .",
    "as the roll angle changed by @xmath273 , the position of acis - s2 changed relative to the aim - point . therefore , some of the reference sources detected in the first epoch were missed entirely by the detector in the second epoch , and vice versa .",
    "this also explains why some of the reference sources have such drastically different count - rates between the two epochs : some of them move from the front - illuminated ( and hence less sensitive ) acis - s2 to the back - illuminated acis - s3 , although in other cases the difference in count - rate is intrinsic , and may reflect flare stars or other variable sources .",
    "we computed 2- and 3-parameter transformations .",
    "as with sgr  1900 + 14 , the 3-parameter transformation did not provide any improvement . with the 2-parameter transformation , we find the position residuals in figure  [ fig : refresids ] .",
    "we also repeated the jackknife and bootstrap tests (   [ sec : pm ] ) .",
    "the residuals in figure  [ fig : refresids ] show an outlier , but it is relatively minor and the jackknifed transformations are consistent with the mean .    with the transformations from the six reference sources , we again find only an upper limit to a displacement between the two epochs",
    ": @xmath274 at 90% confidence ( translating to @xmath275 ) , with additional details given in table  [ tab : pm ] . unlike sgr  1900 + 14 , where the reduced @xmath36 for the 2-parameter transformation was less than 1.0 , here it is 1.4 .",
    "this appears slightly worrisome , and could indicate that we have underestimated our uncertainties , which would make the inferred proper motion less significant .",
    "however , the majority of the problem is caused by a single source , # 6 in table  [ tab : refaxp ] .",
    "this source deviates by @xmath276 , and without it the reduced @xmath36 becomes 1.1 .",
    "including source # 6 , it is still not impossible to get such a large reduced @xmath36 even with a proper description of the data : it should happen about 17% of the time , so our result is not really surprising ( also recall that our tests with the hdf - n observations gave a reduced @xmath36 of 1.33 for 1450 dof with the champ model ) .",
    "overall , the residuals for the remaining sources are reasonably well behaved , and given the tests for sgr  1900 + 14  and those in   [ sec : ref ] , we believe that our uncertainties are on the whole reliable .",
    "our result here is formally a non - detection of the proper motions of sgr  1900 + 14  and 1e  2259 + 586 .",
    "however , the direction and magnitude of sgr  1900 + 14  are suggestive , pointing as they do to a nearby snr ( see   [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to confirm or refute our measurements with newer data . beyond this , one must always view 2-point proper motions with suspicion , as a line can always be fit to two points , and only with the inclusion of a third observation does one begin to gain confidence in the result .",
    "the biggest limiting factor is astrometry of the reference sources ( this is similar to what was found by @xcite ) : increasing the number or accuracy of those measurements would be ideal , but that would have to be done for all of the observations .",
    "just improving the newest one would have little impact .",
    "if we assume similar observations to those presented here , we can achieve frame matching to a precision of @xmath277  pixels between a pair of observations . to measure a proper motion of the order of @xmath278",
    ", we would need to wait @xmath23  yrs from the first observation for a statistically significant ( @xmath279 ) measurement .",
    "this is only considering the first and last data - sets , though : by analyzing all three observations together we can establish a more robust reference frame and confirm the measurement of displacement .",
    "regardless , we would need to wait until 2010 or so before this will be possible .",
    "observations at other wavelengths , possible for 1e  2259 + 586  at least , should be able to achieve higher precision ( * ? ? ? * p.  b.  cameron 2008 , pers . comm . ) .",
    "another approach would be to use the high resolution camera ( hrc ; @xcite ) on _ chandra_. the pixel scale is almost factor of four smaller than that of acis , so the hrc has the potential for better spatial resolution . however , the effective resolution is @xmath280 , not that different from acis .",
    "it also does not suffer from pileup , so bright sources can be observed without penalty .",
    "the main drawback is that because of lower overall efficiency few , if any , reference sources are detected : @xcite and @xcite found only two and three sources , respectively .",
    "the accuracy of our present work is limited by the registration of the separate observations which depends on the reference sources .",
    "this was true even for 1e  2259 + 586 , where pileup limited the centroiding accuracy .",
    "even so , @xcite found a significant proper motion of @xmath281 for rx  j0822@xmath2824300 using three hrc observations ( also see @xcite for an earlier but consistent result ) .",
    "our proper motion limit can be used to limit the age of sgr  1900 + 14/snr  g42.8 + 0.6 , assuming an association . from the 327-mhz radio data from @xcite",
    ", we represent snr  g42.8 + 0.6  as a ring centered at ( j2000 ) : @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and with a radius of @xmath285 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : radiosgr ] ) .",
    "sgr  1900 + 14  would have needed @xmath286  kyr to traverse the separation of @xmath287 , using the 90% confidence upper limit on the proper motion .",
    "this is not a remarkably large age for a magnetar @xcite .",
    "suggestively , the marginal proper motion that we find is directed to the north , and sgr  1900 + 14  sits beyond the northern rim of snr  g42.8 + 0.6 . however ,",
    "our proper motion is so uncertain in both direction and magnitude that an association between sgr  1900 + 14  and the cluster found by @xcite is also consistent with the data .    for 1e  2259 + 586",
    ", we find an upper limit to the proper motion . the snr ctb  109 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : radioaxp ] ) , with which 1e  2259 + 586  is generally taken to be associated , has a somewhat complicated morphology @xcite with what may be multiple shells and seems to be interacting with a giant molecular cloud to the west @xcite .",
    "the site of the explosion is not particularly well defined , given the different shells and the impeded expansion to the west .",
    "however , there does not appear to be any suggestion that 1e  2259 + 586is displaced to the south relative to the explosion center , as our proper motion limit might suggest .",
    "the magnitude of the proper motion limit is not huge : for an age of @xmath288 , 1e  2259 + 586  would have moved @xmath289arcmin , so it could have still had an origin within the current @xmath290-diameter shell for ages up to @xmath291 .",
    "therefore our data do not greatly constrain the association between 1e  2259 + 586  and ctb  109 ( generally assumed to be secure ) .    taken together",
    ", we can try to use the velocities we measure / limit to understand if magnetars have a velocity distribution comparable to that of the radio pulsar population .",
    "the proper motion of xte  j1810@xmath282197 @xcite and the velocity limits inferred by @xcite are less than @xmath292 . for the magnetars considered here , though our results are less constraining .",
    "this is made worse by the very uncertain distances to these objects .",
    "if we accept the association between sgr  1900 + 14  and the massive star cluster of ( * ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) , then we must also accept a distance to sgr  1900 + 14  of @xmath293kpc .",
    "this means that our 90% upper limit on the transverse velocity is 3800@xmath294 , which encompasses the extreme range of velocities posited for the magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the fact of the association itself would imply a small proper motion on the order of @xmath295 . for 1e  2259 + 586 , our transverse velocity limit is moderately constraining ( although with the larger distance of @xcite it increases to almost 2500@xmath294 ) .",
    "future astrometric observations will help answer some of these questions .",
    "we now understand in detail what the limiting factors are , and a third epoch of data around 2010 should allow definitive measurement of the proper motions presented here .",
    "however , the velocity situation will remain more uncertain , owing to the factor of 3 uncertainty in the distance to sgr  1900 + 14  as well as unknown projection effects .",
