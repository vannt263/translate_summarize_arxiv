    "in the context of the minimal standard model ( msm ) , any electroweak ( ew ) process can be computed at tree level from @xmath1 ( the fine structure constant measured at values of @xmath2 close to zero ) ,  ( the w - boson mass ) ,  ( the z - boson mass ) , and  ( the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa flavour - mixing matrix elements ) .    when higher order corrections are included , any observable can be predicted in the `` on - shell '' renormalization scheme as a function of :    o_i & = & f_i ( , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , v_jk )    and contrary to what happens with `` exact gauge symmetry theories '' , like qed or qcd , the effects of heavy particles do not decouple .",
    "therefore , the msm predictions depend on the top mass ( @xmath3 ) and to less extend to the higgs mass ( log(@xmath4 ) ) , or to any kind of `` heavy new physics '' .",
    "the subject of this talk is to show how the high precision achieved in the ew measurements allows to test the msm beyond the tree level predictions and , therefore , how this measurements are able to indirectly determine the value of  and , to constrain the unknown value of , and at the same time to test the consistency between measurements and theory . at present",
    "the uncertainties in the theoretical predictions are dominated by the precision on the input parameters .",
    "the w mass is one of the input parameters in the `` on - shell '' renormalization scheme .",
    "it is known with a precision of about 0.04% , although the usual procedure is to take  ( the fermi constant measured in the muon decay ) to predict  as a function of the rest of the input parameters and use this more precise value .",
    "therefore , the input parameters are chosen to be :    input  parameter & value & relative  uncertainty + ^-1(^2 _ ) = & 128.965 ( 17 ) & 0.013 % + _ ( ^2 _ ) = & 0.118 ( 2 ) & 1.1 % + g _ = & 1.16637 ( 1 ) 10 ^ -5   & 0.0009 % + _ = & 91.1875 ( 21 )   & 0.0023 % + _ = & 174.3 ( 51 )   & 2.9 % + _ > & 114.1  @95%  c.l . &    notice that the less well known parameters are ,  and , of course , the unknown value of .",
    "the next less well known parameter is @xmath5 , even though its value at @xmath6 is known with an amazing relative precision of @xmath7 , ( @xmath8 ) .    the reason for this loss of precision when one computes the running of @xmath1 ,    ^-1(^2 _ ) & = &    is the large contribution from the light fermion loops to the photon vacuum polarisation , @xmath9 .",
    "the contribution from leptons and top quark loops is well calculated  @xcite : @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12  gev .",
    "but for the light quarks non - perturbative qcd corrections are large at low energy scales .",
    "the method so far has been to use the measurement of the hadronic cross section through one - photon exchange , normalised to the point - like muon cross - section , r(s ) , and evaluate the dispersion integral :    ( ^ _ ) & = & ( ds )    giving  @xcite @xmath13 , the error being dominated by the experimental uncertainty in the cross section measurements .",
    "recently , several new _",
    "`` theory driven '' _",
    "calculations  @xcite  @xcite have reduced this error , by extending the regime of applicability of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "these new calculations have been validated by the most recent data at bess  ii  @xcite , included in the evaluation in reference  @xcite .",
    "see a. h@xmath14cker s contribution to these proceedings for more details .",
    "therefore , along this talk , the most precise value from reference  @xcite,@xmath15 , will be consistently used .      from the point of view of radiative corrections",
    "we can divide the experimental measurements into four different groups : the 0  total and partial widths , the partial width into b - quarks ( @xmath16 ) , the 0  asymmetries ( ) and the w mass ( ) . for instance , the leptonic width ( ) is mostly sensitive to isospin - breaking loop corrections ( @xmath17 ) , the asymmetries are specially sensitive to radiative corrections to the 0  self - energy ( @xmath18 ) , and  is mostly sensitive to vertex corrections ( @xmath19 ) in the decay @xmath20 .",
    "one more parameter , @xmath21 , is necessary to describe the radiative corrections to the relation between  and .",
    "the sensitivity of these three 0  observables and  to the input parameters is shown in table  [ tab : sensitiv ] .",
    "the most sensitive observable to the unknown value of  are the 0  asymmetries parametrised via .",
    "however also the sensitivity of the rest of the observables is very relevant compared to the achieved experimental precision .    .",
    "relative error in units of per - mil on the msm predictions induced by the uncertainties on the input parameters .",
    "the second column shows the present experimental errors.[tab : sensitiv ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      lhc and its multipurpose detectors ( atlas / cms ) are the ideal laboratory to disentangle the mystery of mass generation in the msm .",
    "it s therefore interesting to evaluate what could be the situation of the indirect determination of the higgs mass when lhc starts sometime in 2007 .",
    "tevatron has started its run ii program and cdf / d0 expect to collect a significant amount of luminosity during the coming years . in figure  [",
    "fig : logmh ] it is shown the expected direct limit on  with @xmath22 .",
    "it s also shown what would be the improvement in the indirect determination when cdf / d0 are able to measure the top mass with an uncertainty of 3  gev and improve the world average of the w mass to give an uncertainty of 20  mev .",
    "either the higgs particle is found relatively soon ( it may be that lep has already seen the first hints of it ( see a. raspereza s contribution to these proceedings ) ) , or the msm will be in real trouble to describe the precision measurements .",
    "the measurements performed at lep and slc have substantially improved the precision of the tests of the msm , at the level of ( 0.1% ) .",
    "the effects of pure weak corrections are visible with a significance of about five standard deviations from 0  observables and about twelve standard deviations from the w - boson mass .",
    "the top mass predicted by the msm fits , ( = @xmath23  gev ) is in very good agreement with the direct measurement ( = @xmath24  gev ) and of similar precision .",
    "the w - boson mass predicted by the msm fits , ( @xmath25 ) is compatible ( -2.0@xmath26 ) with the direct measurement ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is predicted to be low ,    ( _ / ) = & 1.97 0.19 & ( _ = 94^+52_-35  ) + _ & < & 193  @ 95 %     most of the measurements are internally consistent with the predictions of the msm and with a very low value of the higgs mass ( lower than the limit from direct searches ) .",
    "there are a couple of measurements that do not follow this tendency : the hadronic 0 asymmetries and the nutev measurement prefer a somehow larger value of the higgs mass , and disagree with the msm predictions by about 3@xmath26 and 2.6@xmath26 respectively .",
