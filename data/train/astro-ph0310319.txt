    "x - ray emission is ubiquitous among late - type and pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , as has been amply demonstrated by imaging and low - resolution x - ray observatories @xcite . with the advent of the chandra transmission - grating and the xmm - newton reflection - grating spectrometers",
    ", we can now probe the nature of the x - ray emission in detail through high - resolution line and continuum diagnostics .",
    "early chandra results confirmed some of the abundance anomalies derived from low - resolution imaging spectra and also unambiguously confirmed that few - component temperature models are generally not adequate .",
    "much effort is now being spent to survey and analyze stellar x - ray spectra for a range of intrinsic emission conditions provided by evolutionary state , rotational periods , and activity level .",
    "we can derive temperature distributions and elemental abundances from line - based emission measure analysis under assumptions regarding collisional ionization equilibrium , ionization balance , and uniformity of emitting plasma .",
    "solutions are not unique even under these conditions , but they are a necessary starting point .    here",
    "we present preliminary results for tv  crt ( hd  98800 ) , a wtt , and i m  pegasi ( hd  216489 , hr  8703 ) , a long period rs  cvn binary .",
    "the tw  hya association ( twa ) is an association of about 30 @xcite pms stars at about 50 pc from the sun @xcite and far from star forming clouds .",
    "the twa has provided new insight into the process of star and planet formation ( see for examples * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we observed the wtt star system , tv  crt ( hd 98800 ) , a twa member , to compare its x - ray spectrum with that of the actively accreting tw  hya . tv  crt is a hierarchical quadruple and is one of the best studied examples of a solar mass star - disk system @xcite .",
    "two resolved sources , tv  crt-@xmath0 and -@xmath1 , are visible in the chandra zero - order image , with diskless component @xmath0 being about three times brighter than @xmath1 @xcite . component @xmath0 also flared during our observation . in the dispersed spectrum , we can not separate the @xmath2 due to their proximity ( @xmath3 arcsec ) , given the spectrograph s astigmatism in the spatial dimension .",
    "the first high - resolution x - ray spectrum of a low - mass ctt , tw  hya , showed dramatic differences from other stellar coronal spectra obtained to date : a very cool , sharply peaked temperature distribution , and line ratios indicative of high densities .",
    "abundances were similar to coronae , but more extreme : very weak iron , and very strong neon .",
    "optical and ir observations of tw  hya showed that its disk is nearly face - on @xcite . from this and",
    "the peculiar x - ray line properties , we attributed the x - ray emission to accretion rather than coronal emission from some form of rotational dynamo - driven magnetic activity .",
    "@xcite described the results in detail .",
    "the difference between tv  crt and tw  hya in the helium - like , density - sensitive , triplets of o  vii and ne  ix is obvious even in a casual inspection of the spectra . above a critical density , collisional excitation dominates recombination of the forbidden line ( @xmath4 ) and increases the strength of the intercombination line ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "( the ratio can also be affected by ultraviolet photo - excitation which is significant in systems with o or b stars , but which we do not believe to be significant in tw  hya . ) the @xmath6 ratios for tv  crt are at or near the low density limit , more like the typical coronal spectra of active binaries ( presumably magnetic - dynamo driven ) .",

    "the difference is extreme : no detectable @xmath4 line in tw  hya whereas in tv  crt the @xmath7 and @xmath4 are of comparable intensity and the @xmath5 line is only a marginal detection ( the gray , unfilled curve is the low - density theoretical spectrum).,title=\"fig : \" ] , @xmath5 , @xmath4 ) .",

    "both systems display a cool component at @xmath8 , but the emission measure distribution of tv  crt is flatter and remains high until about 7.0 before declining .",
    "the abundance anomalies deduced from the tv  crt spectrum are not as extreme as in the case of tw  hya , in which fe and ne ratios to solar were about 0.1 and 2.0 ; in tv  crt they are about 0.2 and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "further analysis requires iteration using the derived plasma model to define a physical continuum , then re - measuring lines , and re - deriving the emission measure and abundances until consistent .",
    "solar activity has long been used as a paradigm for the interpretation of activity in cool stars which are presumed to possess a magnetic dynamo based on determinations of magnetic fields and activity cycles @xcite .",
    "the existence of solar - like features such as spots and flares in addition to correlations between rotation rate and x - ray luminosity @xcite lends strong support to the notion of stellar dynamos , but details of solar and stellar dynamos remain obscure ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a discussion of dynamo theory ) .",
    "one goal of research on stellar activity is to determine the underlying coronal heating mechanism , which is not directly observable .",
    "fundamental observable quantities must be derived for a range of stellar parameters in order to provide the basis for a theoretical understanding .",
    "our immediate goals are to use the phased and total x - ray spectra of a long - period active binary to address several issues : determine the temperature distribution ; determine abundances ; probe the geometry via rotational modulation and density diagnostics ; monitor for flares ; and compare to other stars vs.  evolutionary state and environment .",
    "i m  pegasi , a 24d period , k2  iii rs  cvn binary , is one of a very few rs  cvn binaries to have shown rotational modulation in both lower and upper atmospheric emission @xcite .",
    "we monitored i m  peg with the hetgs during two rotations with eight observations of 25ks each .",
    "while there were slow flux modulations , they did not repeat with rotational phase .",
    "hence , we presume they are signatures of long - duration flares , especially since the amplitude of variability , though small , was largest at short wavelengths .",
    "we are in the process of performing line - based , iterative emission measure analysis vs.  flux level . a preliminary emission measure , integrated over the full 200ks is shown in figure  [ fig : dem ] . the emission measure and abundance distributions for i",
    "m  peg are quite similar to those of the 2-day period rs  cvn , ar  lac @xcite .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ]    the hotter peak in the i m  peg distribution ( near @xmath9 ) is probably due to flaring , since we have seen direct correlation of this peak with flares in other stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note the lack of such a peak in the tv  crt curve , and the cool , sharply peaked distribution of tw  hya .",
    "the comparison of three spectra from an actively accreting system , a young but disk - free system , and a `` traditional '' magnetically active corona shows a suggestive progression from accretion to dynamo driven x - rays",
    ". the temperature and density may be clues to differences in x - ray origin .",
    "but there are also similarities requiring explanation : the elemental abundance trends , and the occurrence of flares .",
    "a good sample of high - resolution x - ray spectra of rs cvn binaries and flare stars exists , but many more pms spectra are needed to help resolve these questions .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa contract nas8 - 01129 , sao sv1 - 61010 ( cxc / mit ) , and nasa - chandra award number g02 - 3005a issued by the cxc , which is operated by sao for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas8 - 39073 .",
