    "not long ago only science fiction authors ventured to use a term `` teleportation '' . however in the last few years the situation drastically changed . in a landmark work",
    "@xcite a procedure for teleporting an unknown quantum state from one location to another was described .",
    "recent experiments have proved that this process can actually happen @xcite .",
    "now invention of qt is expected to have a great influence on the future computation and communication hardware comparable with the impact of radio network on modern technique .",
    "it may have important applications in superfast quantum computers ( theoretical at present ) @xcite-@xcite as well as in utilizing quantum phenomena to ensure a secure data transmission ( by means of so - called quantum cryptography ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "practical realization of quantum information processing requires special quantum gates which can not be performed through unitary operations , but may be constructed with the use of quantum teleportation for a basis element @xcite .",
    "recently a one - to - one correspondence between quantum teleportation and dense coding schemes were established as well @xcite . besides a relevancy to such applications as quantum computing ,",
    "qt is also a new fundamental concept in quantum physics .",
    "experimental demonstrations show that qt is an experimentally achievable technique to study the phenomenon of quantum entanglement .",
    "indeed , the very phenomenon of qt appeared to be possible only due to the einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations ( see below ) , which till now are confirmed exactly only for photons .",
    "the same is true for qt , because only entangled optical beams have been so far used to teleport quantum states of massless matter .    since",
    "quantum information processing involves material particles such as atoms and ions , teleportation of heavy matter is considered now as the next necessary step for obtaining a complete set of quantum processing tools @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we propose here a new experimental scheme for qt of heavy matter based on a standard experimental nuclear physics technique and expected to be fulfilled in the nearest one or two years . to the best of our knowledge",
    "other methods require at least ten years to be successful .",
    "in 1935 albert einstein and his colleagues boris podolsky and nathan rosen ( epr ) developed a gedanken experiment to show as they believed a defect in quantum mechanics ( qm)@xcite . this experiment has got the name of epr - paradox .",
    "an essence of epr - paradox is as follows .",
    "there are two particles that have interacted with each other for some time and have constituted a single system . in the qm",
    "that system is described by a certain wave function . when the interaction is terminated and the particles fled far away from each other they are as yet described by the same wave function .",
    "however individual states of each separated particle are completely unknown .",
    "moreover , definite individual properties do not exist in principle as the qm postulates prescribe .",
    "it is only after * one * of the particles is registered by a detection instrument that the states arise to existence for * both * of them .",
    "furthermore , these states are generated simultaneously regardless of the distance between the particles at the moment .",
    "it looks like one particle informs instantly the other of its state .    the real ( not just `` gedanken '' ) experiments on teleportation of information of this type , or `` a spooky - action - at - a - distance '' , as a. einstein called it , were carried out only 30 - 35 years later , in the seventies - eighties@xcite .",
    "experimenters , however , managed to achieve full and definite success only for photons , though attempts to perform experiments with atoms@xcite and protons were also undertaken@xcite . for the case of two photons the experiments were carried out for various distances between them at the moment of registration , and the epr - correlations were shown to survive up to as large distances as more than ten kilometers@xcite . in the case of protons ,",
    "an experiment was carried out only for much less distances of about a few centimeters and the condition of causal separation , @xmath2 , was not met .",
    "thus it was not fully persuasive , as have been recognized by the authors of the work@xcite themselves .",
    "the next step in this direction that suggested itself was not merely the `` action - at - a - distance '' , but transmission of a quantum state from one quantum object to another .",
    "namely , this process was called qt . in spite of the successful epr - effect experiments it was until recently even this kind of teleportation",
    "was believed to be impossible at all . at first sight",
    "it seems as heisenberg uncertainty principle would forbid the very first step of the teleportation which was meant as an extraction of complete information about the inner properties of a quantum object to be teleported .",
    "but it can not be done because of an impossibility to measure simultaneously exact values for the so - called complementary variables of a quantum microscopic object ( e.g. spatial coordinates and momenta ) .",
    "nevertheless , in 1993 , a group of physicists ( c.bennet and his colleagues ) managed to get round this difficulty@xcite .",
    "they showed that measurement of full quantum information is not necessary for quantum states transferring from one object to another .",
    "instead , it was proposed to create that a so - called epr - channel of communication on the basis of epr - pair of two quantum particles .",
    "let it be photons b and c , shown in fig.1 .",
    "after they have interacted in a way to form a single system , decaying afterward , the photon b is directed to the `` point of departure '' , where it meets a within a registration system .",
    "the system is arranged in a mode ( see below ) to `` catch '' only those events which leave no choice to c but to take a state that a had initially ( before its interaction with b in the detector at the `` point of departure '' ) .",
    "this experimental technique is very fine but well known to those skilled in the epr - art .",
    "what is important from the principal point of view , it is `` disappearing '' of a in the place , notified in fig.1 as `` zone of scanning '' ( zs ) . indeed ,",
    "interaction of b and a destroys the a photon , in a sense that none of the two photons outgoing from zs has definite properties of a. they constitute a new pair of photons , which only as a whole has some quantum state , and the individual components of the pair are deprived of this property .",
    "therefore , in some sense the photon a really disappears at zs .",
    "exactly at the same moment the photon c obtains the properties a had in the beginning .",
    "once it is happened , in view of the principle of identity of elementary particles , we can say that a , disappearing at zs , reappears at another location .",
    "thus , the quantum teleportation is accomplished .",
    "this process has several paradoxical features . in spite of the absence of contacts between objects ( particles , photons ) a and c ,",
    "a manages to pass its properties to c. it may be arranged in such a way that the distance from a to c is large enough to prevent any causal signals between them ! furthermore , in contrast to the transportation of ordinary material cargo , when a delivery vehicle first visits the sender to collect a cargo from it , quantum properties are delivered in a backward fashion .",
    "here the photon b plays a role of the delivery vehicle , and one can see that b first interacts with the recipient ( c photon ) and only after that it travels to the sender ( a ) for the `` cargo '' .    finally , to reconstruct initial object",
    "completely it is necessary to inform a receiver at the destination about a result of the measurement in zs .",
    "this allows him to accomplish processing of quantum signal ( incoming with the particle c ) in a due manner .",
    "therefore , one more channel of communication is needed for an ordinary or classical information transmission . only receiving a message ( using the classical communication line ) that a and b form a * new epr ",
    "pair with zero total spin * , an observer at destination may be sure that the properties of c are identical to those of a before teleportation . in the case when a  @xmath3  b system has non a zero total spin , some additional transformation of quantum signal is needed ( see below ) .",
    "the new idea was immediately recognized as an important one and several groups of experimenters set to implement it concurrently .",
    "nevertheless , it took more than four years to overcome all technological obstacles on the way@xcite .",
    "that was because such experiments , being the records , are always a step beyond the limits of experimental state of the art achieved before .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that experimental setups and instruments developed for conventional nuclear - physics studies allow one to design a new way of performing non - zero mass matter teleportation , with a prospect to implement the project in a rather short time .",
    "for example , in accordance with our estimates , teleportation of protons could be achieved in one or two years .",
    "is initial proton from the accelerator , lh@xmath4 is a liquid hydrogen target , which may be also replaced by ordinary polyethylene ( ch@xmath4 ) foils , protons p@xmath5 and p@xmath6 constitute an entangled epr - pair , ph@xmath4 denotes polarized hydrogen target , c is a carbon target which operates as an analyzer of the proton polarization using the left - right asymmetry of scattering , f-1 and f-2 are large - aperture position - sensitive particle detectors ( the so - called fobos - facilities ) .",
    "proton spin - state is being teleported from the ph@xmath4 target placed at x@xmath7 to the point x@xmath8 .",
    "k is a point where the spin of p@xmath5 gets a definite orientation ( which is just the same that one of the protons p@xmath8 in the ph@xmath4 target had before the scattering of p@xmath6 from it ) .",
    "the proton p@xmath8 losses its definite quantum state , as it forms a new epr - pair together with the scattered proton p@xmath6 .",
    "the role of classical communication channel including a data - processing center is explained in the text . ]    in fig.2 , the layout of an experiment on teleportation of spin states of protons from a polarized ph@xmath4 target into the point of destination ( target c ) is shown .",
    "a proton beam p@xmath7 of a suitable energy within the range 20 - 50 mev bombards the lh@xmath4 hydrogen target @xcite . according to the known experimental data , the scattering in the lh@xmath4 target onto the direction of the second target ( corresponding the angle @xmath9 at the c.m . ) occurs within an acceptable accuracy through the singlet intermediary state @xcite .",
    "thus , the outgoing protons p@xmath4 and p@xmath10 form the two - proton entangled system fully analogous to the epr - correlated photons used in the experiments on the teleportation of massless matter , as it was discussed in the preceding section . at this moment",
    "the system is in a state latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{23}\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|\\uparrow_2\\rangle|\\downarrow_3\\rangle-     one of the scattered protons , p@xmath4 , then travels to the point of destination ( the target - analyzer c ) , while the other , p@xmath10 , arrives to a point where teleportation is started , i.e. , to ph@xmath4-target .",
    "the last one is used as a source of particles to be teleported .",
    "therefore , protons within this target play the same role asthe photons a in the above section .",
    "but there are two features differentiating the case of protons from the photon one .",
    "first , the protons p@xmath8 are within the motionless target ( and thus they are motionless themselves ) with a much more proton density ; besides , the protons within the ph@xmath4 target have quite definite quantum state , determined by a direction of polarization , @xmath12 which could be oriented accidentally and , thus , unknown to the experimenters .    in the case , when the scattering in the polarized ph@xmath4 target occurs in the same kinematics conditions as in the lh@xmath4 target ( i.e. , at the c.m . angle @xmath9 )",
    ", the total spin of the particles p@xmath8 and p@xmath10 also must be equal to zero after collision . to detect the events , a removable circular module f-1 of the facility `` fobos ''",
    "is supposed to be used @xcite . due to this fact , the detection efficiency is hoped to be much enhanced .",
    "if all the above conditions are provided , the protons reaching a point k will suddenly receive the same spin projections as the protons in the polarized @xcite ph@xmath4 target .",
    "indeed , using a so - called bell s basis , @xmath13 @xmath14 the state of three - particle system before the last scattering may be written in the form @xmath15 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the last scattering and measurement with f-1 select from this state the term containing @xmath16 , and therefore the state of the particle 2 will be @xmath17 .",
    "thus , if the coincidence mode of the detection is provided via any classical channel , then a strong correlation has to take place between polarization direction in the ph@xmath4 target and the direction of the deflection of p@xmath4-protons scattered in the carbon target c. here the carbon foil c plays a role of the polarization analyzer , i.e. , one measures the asymmetry of the left - right counting rates to determine a spin state orientation of p@xmath4 before the scattering @xcite .",
    "in particular , if one succeeds to make a distance between the detectors f-1 and f-2 to be sufficiently large and the difference between the moments of registration in f-1 and f-2 to be short enough , then it will be possible to meet the important criteria of the causal independence between the events of the `` departure '' of the quantum state from ph@xmath4 target and `` arrival '' of this `` cargo '' to the recipient ( proton p@xmath4 ) at the point k. the measurements consist of recording signals entering two independent but strictly synchronized memory devices with the aim to select afterward those events alone that for sure appeared to be causal separated .",
    "thus , experimental setup shown in fig",
    ".  2 also allows one , at least in principle , to fill the gap in verification of the epr - effect for heavy matter .",
    "in the experiments that were carried out until now it was managed to use only one quantum information transmission channel corresponding to registration of bell s state @xmath16 .",
    "is it possible to involve other channels utilizing the states @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ? to answer this question let us consider a general expression for scattering amplitude of two particles , not necessarily identical ones , with the spin value @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath21 using a relation @xmath22 , \\ ] ] in the case of the coordinate system to be fixed for a definiteness in the following way @xmath23 the expression for @xmath24 can be represented in the form @xmath25 + \\frac{c}{2}\\left[s^2_y-\\frac12\\right ] + \\frac{d}{2}\\left[s^2_z-\\frac12\\right]+es_z - fs_z,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 the scattering operator @xmath24 can be now expressed in terms of the bell s state transition operators making use of the following formulas @xmath27 and a decomposition of the unity @xmath28 . as a result one obtains @xmath29 where @xmath30 c= a+ , d = a + .",
    "@xmath31 in the case @xmath32 expression ( 1 ) is a usual spectral decomposition for the operator @xmath33 , which can be interpreted then as a quantum observable corresponding to measurement of one of the bell s state .",
    "therefore , to register a definite bell s state one has to find such experimental conditions at which all coefficients but one of a , b , c , or d in the expression ( [ f ] ) turn into zero .",
    "for these purposes , the type and energy of colliding particles , as well as the angle which scattered particles are recorded at , could be altered .",
    "since the number of necessary conditions formulated above is less than the number of free coefficients in ( [ f ] ) , it is clear that registration of each bell s state is possible at least theoretically .",
    "directions which spin projections of the scattered particles should be measured along for detecting the states @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 form three orthogonal spatial vectors .",
    "it follows from the relations @xmath37 where @xmath38 are orthonormalized states with the definite values of the spin and its projections , @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 , represent the group of permutation for the bell s states considered ( putting aside an unimportant phase factor -1 ) .",
    "thus the possibility of registration of @xmath34 state also opens the way to register two other states @xmath36 , @xmath35 by means of change on @xmath41 of the direction along which the spin projection is measured .",
    "for identical spin 1/2 particles the scattering operator ( [ f ] ) has some additional symmetries , so that in c.m.s .",
    "one has @xmath42",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 for nucleon - nucleon scattering we have @xmath45 as total spin squared of such a system is conserved and the last two terms in ( [ f ] ) describe transitions between bell s state with different @xmath46 .",
    "thus , e.g. , for two identical nucleons at @xmath47 one obtains @xmath48 and @xmath34 is rather simple due to the characterization of these states by the definite values of total spin and its projections @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , @xmath50 , respectively ) .",
    "the result of spin projection measurement for the particles 1 and 3 is @xmath52 for any choice of z axis direction , provided their initial state is @xmath53 .    for particles in the @xmath34 state such correlations",
    "take place only if the spin projections are measured along a definite axis @xmath54 .",
    "if the axis of measuring is deflected at an angle @xmath55 from this direction the probability to have @xmath56 will decrease as @xmath57 .",
    "one may expect that at the energies considered , there is a scattering angle interval corresponding to @xmath58 and , therefore , to the @xmath34 final state of two protons .",
    "it seems more difficult to identify states @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in this case , it is necessary first to find out a direction @xmath59 ( which is perpendicular to @xmath54 ) for which measurements of spin projections give either @xmath60 and @xmath61 or @xmath62 and @xmath63 with the same probability @xmath64 .",
    "now measurement of the spin projection of the particle 2 allows one to determine what of two two possible states , @xmath19 or @xmath20 , the scattering has really occurred into .",
    "referring to the principle of identity of elementary particles of the same sort with the same quantum characteristics , i.e. , the protons in our case , we can say that protons from a polarized target ph@xmath4 are transmitted to the destination point c ( through the point k ) .",
    "thus , in the nearest future , teleportation of protons can come from the domain of dreams and fiction to the reality in physicists laboratories .",
