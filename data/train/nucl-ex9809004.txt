    "in 1996 the heavy - ion community explored a whole new physics landscape by measuring au+au reactions at beam energies of 2 , 4 , 6 and 8 agev . with experimental data to link the ags full - energy of 10 agev and the bevalac / sis energies of 1 - 2 agev , we can uniquely explore how the physics of strongly - interacting matter changes as a function of density .",
    "the results from experiments e895 and e866/e917 @ ags and kaos @ sis are becoming available , so it is timely to review the physics of strange particle production across the energy range from sis to ags .",
    "there are at least three interconnected physics questions about how matter of increasing density behaves ; 1 ) what are the appropriate degrees - of - freedom ? , multiply - colliding hadrons and their excited resonances , or is the matter dense enough such that a baryon - rich quark - gluon plasma@xcite is formed , 2 ) if the system remains in the hadronic sector , do the hadrons propagate with an effective mass different than their free mass@xcite , and 3 ) do multi - body , instead of two - body , hadronic collisions play a role in the reaction dynamics@xcite ?    before reviewing the data and the status of answers to these physics questions , i would like to expand on each of the three topics .",
    "in contrast to the high - temperature qgp where quarks and gluons are predicted to be quasi - free , the baryon(quantum - number)-rich plasma is conjectured to have momentum - space correlations between pairs of quarks@xcite .",
    "this pairing is predicted to produce a color - superconducting quark - gluon phase of matter .",
    "the transitions between this phase , the quasi - free quark - gluon phase , and normal hadronic matter could make a rich and varied phase diagram of strongly - interacting matter .",
    "however there is currently little knowledge of what signatures could indicate the onset of the superconducting quark phase , or whether the standard battery of high - temperature qgp signatures would retain their sensitivity in the baryon - rich phase .",
    "dense matter , which at several times normal nuclear density ( @xmath0 ) may be insufficient to form a quark - gluon plasma , should still be considered a novel and fascinating system in its own right . at four times",
    "normal density the mean - free path ( @xmath1 ) of typical hadrons is a strikingly small 0.5  fm .",
    "this estimate of the mean free path is smaller than the typical size of a hadron which implies that the system is so densely packed that each hadron can collide several times per 1fm / c .",
    "such multiple collisions will not be independent of each other and could behave differently than a succession of two - body collisions@xcite .    at considerably lower densities",
    "there are several predictions@xcite that kaons have in - medium properties .",
    "k@xmath2 are predicted to interact attractively with baryons , which can be implicitly accounted for by either an attractive mean - field@xcite or by decreasing the k@xmath2 effective mass with density@xcite .",
    "k@xmath3 are expected to have a repulsive interaction with baryons@xcite . in transport calculations of heavy - ion reactions , these in - medium effects",
    "are predicted to strongly increase the yield of k@xmath2 due to the increase of phase - space from the drop in k@xmath2 mass .",
    "the spectra of k@xmath3 and k@xmath2 are also predicted to be shifted in opposite directions@xcite , with k@xmath3 repelled to higher transverse momentum and k@xmath2 attracted to lower values of transverse momentum .    by changing the density it may be possible , but very difficult , to identify any density - dependent in - medium effect and separate this from other processes that affect kaon production , e.g. multiple secondary collisions . to establish",
    "the existence of in - medium physics will require the systematic use of the measured k@xmath3 and k@xmath2 yields and spectra as a function of beam - energy . as a strong consistency check ,",
    "any posited explanation of an experimental result that supports in - medium physics , must also explain data at other beam energies , as well as the other observables that are sensitive to in - medium effects .    by studying strangeness production as a function of beam energy",
    "we can probe these three interlinked physics questions : in - medium properties , multi - body collisions , and the baryon - rich qgp .",
    "this will help us make progress towards a consistent understanding of the behavior of strongly - interacting matter as a function of density .",
    "in figure 1 the yield of k@xmath3 per projectile participant is plotted versus the number of projectile participants in au+au reactions at the full ags energy of 11.6agev@xcite .",
    "the number of participants is calculated from the measured energy of the projectile spectators .",
    "the yield per projectile participant in central reactions is 3.5 times larger than the k@xmath3 yields from the isospin - averaged n - n collisions at the same beam energy .",
    "this extra production steadily increases with the number of projectile participants and hence most probably comes from multiple secondary collisions of hadrons in a heavy - ion reaction@xcite .",
    "this mechanism is aided by many of the secondary collisions being between one or two hadronic resonances with the energy of the resonances available for kaon production .",
    "in au+au collisions at 1 agev@xcite , k@xmath3 production per participant also increases with centrality ( figure 2 ) , suggesting that a similar secondary collision production mechanism may work at both sis and ags energies .",
    "the pion yield per participant ( figure 2 ) is nearly independent of centrality .",
    "it is possible that the difference between pions and kaons is the strong absorption of pions .",
    "the kaon yield can be parameterized as a power law in the number of participants @xmath4 at sps energies , where the centrality dependence of kaons yields is not yet available , the power - law exponent for @xmath5 production is used instead@xcite .",
    "the power - law exponent @xmath6 decreases with higher beam energies ( figure 3 ) .",
    "if kaon enhancement is defined as the yield in central collisions compared to either peripheral collisions , or n - n reactions , then the enhancement of strangeness is largest at the lower beam energies .",
    "this is consistent with secondary collisions increasing in relative importance for kaon production compared to initial collisions as the beam energy is reduced .",
    "the change in the power - law exponent for k@xmath3 production demonstrates that heavy - ion yields have a different beam energy dependence than proton - proton reactions .",
    "secondary collisions will also change the energy dependence of the k@xmath2 yield .",
    "this is an effect which will need to be firmly understood before any in - medium mass reduction of k@xmath2 can be inferred from the yield of k@xmath2 or the shape of its excitation function@xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare k@xmath2 and k@xmath3 production by plotting the ratio of total yields as a function of the number of participants .",
    "figure 4 shows the k@xmath2/k@xmath3 ratio in au+au reactions at 11.6 agev / c@xcite , and figure 5 plots this ratio for ni+ni reactions at 1.8 agev@xcite . at both beam energies , and also at the intermediate energy of 4 agev , the k@xmath2/k@xmath3 ratio is independent of centrality .",
    "whatever mechanism drives the enhancement of kaons with centrality , it similarly affects the production of both k@xmath3 and k@xmath2 .",
    "given the many differences between k@xmath2 and k@xmath3 production , absorption , and possible opposite changes of in - medium mass , the observation that the k@xmath2/k@xmath3 ratio is constant with centrality is a puzzle .",
    "at each beam energy , the volume of dense matter , and even the density should increase with centrality .",
    "any possible k@xmath2 mass decrease with density should lead to an increase in the k@xmath2/k@xmath3 ratio with centrality . this is not observed , potentially placing a strong constraint on the existence of in - medium kaon properties .",
    "a review of the theoretical effort to model these reactions is outside the scope of this paper . for our purposes we can divide the models into two classes , those that include the possibility of hadrons having an effective in - medium mass ( hsd@xcite , rbuu@xcite , art@xcite ) and those that use normal masses throughout ( rqmd@xcite , urqmd@xcite and the above codes run in normal - mass mode ) .",
    "calculations that use in - medium masses successfully reproduce the experimental yield of k@xmath2 to within  30% at both gsi@xcite and ags@xcite energies . the k@xmath2/k@xmath3 ratio has also been studied@xcite .",
    "the calculated ratio increases with centrality when in - medium masses are used , however the predicted effect is negated by the increased absorption of k@xmath2 in dense matter .",
    "while such a cancelation is plausible , it would be unusual for the cancelation to occur at all energies from 1 to 10agev and as such , the explanation should be checked across this full energy range .",
    "no consistent picture has yet to emerge on the calculated k@xmath3 yields . using an increasing in - medium mass for k@xmath3 ,",
    "transport calculations underpredict the measured yield by factors of two@xcite . as a cross - check on the consistency of k@xmath3 production in these models , rqmd , hsd , and art calculations with unmodified , normal masses for au+au reactions at 11.6 agev / c",
    "are compared in figure 6 .",
    "rqmd impressively reproduces the centrality dependence of kaon production , whereas both art and hsd , for which only central calculations are available , produce too few kaons .",
    "these calculations nominally include the same physics , i.e. multiple scattering and excitation of a range of resonances , yet for central collisions there is a factor of two discrepancy between the predictions .",
    "this indicates the current level of model uncertainty of how to calculate the details of a cascade of interacting hadrons .",
    "given this range of model systematics it is premature to claim the existence of in - medium masses using a model comparison of kaon yields@xcite .",
    "the situation can be improved by constraining the models to reproduce the high precision p+p@xmath7k@xmath3 data from cosy@xcite , and the semi - inclusive p+a data at ags energies that is becoming available . as an example",
    "the yield of k@xmath8 in p+au at 18 gev / c from e910@xcite is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the yield increases rapidly with the number of slow particles associated with the reaction , consistent with the hypothesis that as the proton suffers multiple collisions , it increases both strangeness and the overall yield of particles .",
    "successful transport models should be able to reproduce the wide range of p+p , p+a reactions as an entry step towards the harder problems of a+a reactions .",
    "insight into the dynamics of particle production and propagation can be obtained by examining the spectra of kaons . in the top panels of figure  8 ,",
    "dn / dy distributions for k@xmath3 and k@xmath2 are shown for a mid - central event class of au+au reactions at 11.6 agev / c@xcite .",
    "these have been extracted from exponential fits to invariant spectra as a function of transverse mass . also extracted from each transverse spectrum",
    "is the inverse slope , t. the rapidity dependence of the inverse slope parameter is shown in the lower panels of figure  8 .",
    "the dn / dy distribution for k@xmath2 is narrower than for k@xmath3 , and the k@xmath3 inverse slopes tend to be slightly larger than the inverse slope for k@xmath2",
    ". both observations are consistent with there being less phase space available for k@xmath2 due to the higher energy threshold for k@xmath2k@xmath3 pair production compared to k@xmath9 associated production .",
    "in contrast , the transport model rqmd predicts that the k@xmath2 inverse slopes are larger than those for k@xmath3 .",
    "this can be seen in figure 9 which plots the difference of slopes , + t@xmath10-t@xmath11 .",
    "the incorrect ordering of slopes in rqmd could be caused by a too strong absorption of low m@xmath12 k@xmath2 effectively increasing the k@xmath2 inverse slope .",
    "this could merely be a problem with the parameterization or alternatively it could indicate the need to include either multi - body collisions@xcite or an attractive in - medium potential to the transport model .",
    "this would effectively soften the k@xmath2 spectra as has been observed in the in - medium hsd calculations for ni+ni reactions at 1.8 agev@xcite .",
    "in addition to the softening of spectra , a rather striking low - p@xmath12 rise has been predicted in the k@xmath2 spectra due to the attractive mean - field@xcite . in preliminary e864 data@xcite at the ags",
    "there is no observation of such a rise even at values of m@xmath12-m@xmath13=50 mev . at gsi",
    "the predicted rise occurs just beyond the current experimental acceptance@xcite .",
    "one sensitive probe of the possible existence of in - medium kaon properties is collective flow .",
    "figure 10 shows the measure k@xmath3 squeezeout@xcite , or preferential emission at azimuthal angles 90@xmath14 and 270@xmath15 from the event reaction plane , in au+au reactions at 1agev .",
    "the rbuu calculations that include an in - medium repulsive kaon potential better reproduce the measured azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "the kaon production rate from a qgp has been predicted to be larger than the hadronic production rate , leading to the suggestion that strangeness enhancement is a plausible qgp signature@xcite . as the beam energy is increased from 1 to 10agev , the density of the participating matter should increase@xcite .",
    "a small but increasing volume of qgp might be observable as an additional increase in kaon production beyond the hadronic enhancement from multiple collisions .",
    "this would not necessarily be a sharp onset with beam energy , but rather a change of evolution in strange yields .",
    "the mid - rapidity yields of @xmath16 and k@xmath3 as a function of the initial available energy @xmath17 are shown in the upper panels of figure  11 .",
    "both pion and kaon yields increase steadily and smoothly with beam energy .",
    "there is no statistically significant indication of any sudden increase , or change in evolution of the particle yield with increasing @xmath17 .    in the lower panels of figure  11 , the @xmath18 of the transverse spectra minus the rest mass for @xmath16 and k@xmath3",
    "are plotted versus @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 is calculated from each fit to the transverse spectrum and hence includes an extrapolation to low m@xmath12 .",
    "compared to the increase of particle production , the @xmath18 increases slowly with beam energy .",
    "the extra available energy mainly goes into more particle production rather than increased transverse energy .",
    "the increase in kaon mid - rapidity yield with beam energy in figure 11 is more rapid than the increase of pion yield .",
    "this is emphasized in figure  12 , where the @xmath19 ratio of dn / dy is plotted versus @xmath17 .",
    "this ratio increases steadily from near 3% at 2 a  gev to 19% at 10.7 a  gev .",
    "the mid - rapidity k@xmath3/@xmath16 ratio from central au+au reactions at 1  a  gev from the kaos collaboration@xcite is k@xmath3/@xmath20 .",
    "this is one order of magnitude below the k@xmath3/@xmath16 ratio at 2  a  gev .",
    "also shown in this figure is the @xmath19 ratio measured in central pb+pb reactions at cern@xcite .",
    "this ratio is comparable , if somewhat lower , than the ags result .    the double ratio , the measured au+au k@xmath21 ratio divided by the p+p k@xmath21 ratio is shown in figure  13 .",
    "this double ratio is greater than one , demonstrating that k@xmath3/@xmath16 is enhanced in au+au reactions relative to p+p collisions .",
    "this enhancement steadily decreases and is low at sps beam energies , possibly because secondary collisions decrease in relative importance for kaon production compared to initial collisions as the beam energy is increased .",
    "a steady decrease in enhancement coupled with the smooth increase in the k/@xmath22 ratio from p+p reactions naturally produces a maximum in the k/@xmath22 ratio in a+a reactions .",
    "many new measurements on strangeness have recently been made . at gsi",
    "the kaos collaboration is analysing proton and carbon - induced reactions to provide a baseline for kaon production via multiple secondary collisions .",
    "detailed k@xmath3 and k@xmath2 spectra at 4 agev from e866@ags will provide more information on possible in - medium effects . complementing the kaon data is the measurement of the @xmath5 excitation function by e895@ags .",
    "multi - strange production from au+au ( e896 ) and p+a reactions ( e910 ) at the ags will be soon available to compare to the results at sps .",
    "in addition e917@ags is analysing the centrality dependence of anti - lambda as well as the mass , width of the decay @xmath23k@xmath3k@xmath2 .",
    "the availability of heavy - ion data at beam energies of 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 agev has bridged the gap between bevalac / sis and ags accelerators . this provides the opportunity to systematically study the properties of strongly - interacting matter as a function of the density .",
    "two intriguing possibilities are the whether hadrons change their properties in a dense medium , or whether the baryon - rich quark - gluon plasma can be found .",
    "the observation of k@xmath3 squeezeout in au+au reactions at 1 agev is consistent with the presence of a repulsive kaon potential .",
    "however transport models that include such effects underpredict the yield of k@xmath3 . in - medium",
    "effects are also predicted to increase the yield of k@xmath2 , potentially changing the k@xmath2/k@xmath3 ratio as a function of centrality and causing a sharp low p@xmath12 rise in the k@xmath2 spectra .",
    "neither effect is observed .    taking the above data together as a whole",
    ", there is no consistent evidence for kaon in - medium properties .",
    "in addition using model comparisons to extract this physics is difficult .",
    "the factor of two discrepancy between different models with nominally the same physics input indicates the current level of uncertainty in how to calculate a cascade of interacting hadrons .",
    "given this range of model systematics it is premature to claim the existence of in - medium masses using a model comparison of kaon yields .    at densities four to five times normal nuclear matter densities multi - body ( as opposed to two - body ) collisions could dominate the dynamics .",
    "this topic needs more attention , in particular how to distinguish multi - body collisions from a succession of two - body interactions .",
    "the measured particle yields and the k@xmath3/@xmath16 ratio smoothly evolve with beam energy between 1 and 10 agev .",
    "there is no indication of a change in behavior that could indicate the onset of a baryon - rich qgp . by establishing an energy dependence of particle production ,",
    "the data provide a stronger link between ags and sps energies .",
    "interpolating between the newly available excitation function and the full sps energy leads to empirical predictions for quantities such as the k/@xmath22 ratio at energies of 30 - 40 agev , the planned low - energy run at the sps .",
    "the extension of the excitation function from sis@xmath7ags@xmath7sps will provide a new opportunity to examine how strongly interacting matter evolves with density and whether there is any indication of the onset of the quark - gluon plasma .",
