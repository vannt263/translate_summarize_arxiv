    "the frequency- and electric - field - dependent conductivity investigation of different network densities is not only helpful to build a comprehensive understanding of the electrical transport properties of swcnt networks , but is also important for the sake of applications of these networks.@xcite for example , when using swcnt networks to construct high speed transistors , or as transparent shielding materials , knowledge of their frequency dependent electric transport properties are required .",

    "different carbon nanotube sources have different bundle sizes and lengths , which causes the conductance difference .",

    "when one measures the conductance at a given frequency , there is a typical probed length scale . at low frequencies ( corresponding to long time periods )",

    "the junction resistances between different tubes are much larger than the resistances of the tubes themselves .",
    "@xcite hence the conductance is small and equal to the dc conductance . as the frequency increases , @xmath22 becomes smaller than @xmath19 , @xmath23 , and the junction resistances have less contribution to the total resistance .",
    "the intrinsic properties of the swcnt then dominate the measurement .",

    "@xcite    the swcnt film can be treated as a random walk network , in which the probed length scale at a given frequency goes as @xmath24 . then with the onset frequency @xmath0 of samples we are able to estimate their correlation length @xmath25 . as the density of the swcnt networks increases , there are more junctions and the average distance between connections , the correlation length @xmath19 , becomes smaller and thus the onset frequency @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior shown by the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : figurecond ] .",
    "from the measured frequency dependent conductivity , we observed that the correlation length @xmath19 varies as the thickness of the film increases .",
    "due to the large resistance of junctions between different tubes , the carriers in the swcnt networks are easier to move on small length scales than on larger length scales .",
    "this phenomenon inspires us to investigate whether the transport properties are nonlinear as a result . according to the works of m. s. fuhrer _",

    "@xmath26 one can determine a length scale of the system : @xmath27 where @xmath1 corresponds to the size of the regions with good conductivity , and @xmath28 is the energy gained by a carrier in one conducting region on average.@xcite .",

    "note that this is much larger than the @xmath4 obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "this suggests that a different mechanism for hindering transport is active here , namely poor contacts between bundles of swcnts .    to investigate the dependence of @xmath29 on the film thickness , we measured the electric field - dependent conductance for samples with various thicknesses .",

    "= 2.6 in    although the localization behavior may be affected by the properties of individual swcnts @xcite , the above result shows that the observed behavior is more likely a consequence of poor electric conduction through inter - bundle junctions . as the thickness and density increase , there are more and more connections , which decreases the length scale @xmath29 , as shown in fig.[fig : swcntfig6 ] .    when the film thickness increases to a large value , the density of the swcnts and connections of the film will finally saturate and stop increasing . for those very thick swcnt films ( also called mats ) , their correlation length @xmath19 , and also the length scale @xmath29 , as well as the onset frequency ,",
