    "at low redshift we have found that the ionized ( `` warm '' ) x - ray absorbers and the associated uv absorbers in two radio - loud quasars were due to the same material : an x - ray quiet quasar 3c351 ( mathur et al .",
    "1994 ) and a red quasar 3c212 ( elvis et al . , 1994 , mathur 1994 ) . in both cases the absorber",
    "is situated outside the broad emission line region ( belr ) , is outflowing , and is highly ionized .",
    "this delineates a new nuclear component in lobe - dominated , radio - loud quasars .",
    "could the same component explain all the x - ray and uv absorption in agn seen over the past 20 years and more ( anderson 1974 , ulrich 1988 ) ?",
    "we have recently tested this generalization using the best studied of all agn , ngc5548 .",
    "we applied the same photoionization modeling method ( mathur et al . , 1994 ) to the x - ray and uv absorbers in ngc5548 to determine whether consistent values for the abundances of all the observed ions could be obtained . in ngc5548",
    "the model must meet two extra requirements : it must not lead to a density for the absorber in conflict with its recombination time ; and the distance of the absorber from the continuum source must not conflict with the well - determined belr size .    at high redshifts x - ray absorption and rest frame uv absorption have been found together in a number of radio - loud quasars .",
    "the low energy x - ray cut - offs in these objects are likely to be due to their environment .",
    "the absorption seen in the high - z quasars may be similar to the low - z ` x / uv ' absorption , but on a larger scale .",
    "asca observations confirm the presence of an ionized absorber in ngc5548 with equivalent n@xmath0 ( fabian et al . 1994a ) , and resolving the ovii and oviii absorption edges .",
    "an fe - k edge is not detected ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "hst finds blueshifted uv absorption lines ( korista et al .",
    "the civ and n  v doublets , and an associated ly@xmath2 absorption line ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) are all clearly seen in the mean fos spectrum .",
    "we searched ( using cloudy , ferland 1991 ) for a photoionized absorber satisfying both x - ray and uv constraints .",
    "figure 1 shows the ionization fractions of ovii and oviii as a function of ionization parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "we used the de - reddened continuum for ngc5548 and assumed solar abundances ( grevesse & andres 1989 ) and density @xmath6 atoms @xmath7 .",
    "the asca constraints on the fractional ionization of ovii and oviii ( fig.1 , thick lines ) allow only a narrow range of @xmath5 , @xmath8 .    in the mean hst spectrum ,",
    "the civ doublet ratio is 3.8@xmath9 , putting them off the linear portion of the curve of growth .",
    "a consistent solution for all three ions , civ , nv and hi is obtained for b=40  km  s@xmath10 , with only a small tolerance for both uv and x - ray constraints to be met ( see mathur et al .",
    "1995 for the details of the model ) .",
    "the matching of the five ion abundances leads us to conclude that the uv and x - ray absorbers in ngc5548 are one and the same .",
    "an additional test of the model is now available .",
    "the hst ly-@xmath2 hi column density is highly uncertain : @xmath11 , while the model values are tightly constrained , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "mathur et al . ( 1995 ) noted that a lyman edge absorption would be observed if @xmath14 , and would be detectable by hut . in the event hut did not find a lyman edge ( kriss et al .",
    "1996 ) , implying n@xmath15 , close to our best fit value .",
    "this strengthens our x / uv model .",
    "ovi absorption would provide another strong test .",
    "unfortunately the hut spectrum seems to have low s / n in ovi , although the ovi absorption doublets may be present .    our model is also consistent with the asca limit on an fe - k x - ray absorption edge of @xmath16 , implying n@xmath17 @xmath4 ( for solar abundance ) . for our best fit model",
    "the dominant stage of iron is fexvii .",
    "( this is common .",
    "fexvii dominates over a wider range of @xmath5 than other ionization states since it is neon - like and so more stable than other iron ions . )",
    "we find @xmath18 , implying n@xmath19 , far below the asca limit .",
    "the absence of an fe - k absorption edge affects another model . the warm gas above and below the torus that electron scatters and polarizes light from the belr into our line of sight in many seyfert 2 galaxies is a natural candidate for the ionized x - ray absorbers ( krolik & kriss , 1996 ) . in unified schemes",
    "this gas will be seen pole - on in seyfert 1 galaxies and will cause absorption .",
    "krolik & kriss ( 1996 ) predict an fe - k or an fe - l edge of optical depth @xmath20 .",
    "the absence of these features in the ngc5548 asca spectrum pushes these models to higher @xmath5 and so lower @xmath21 and larger size .",
    "our x / uv absorber modeling finds smaller column density material at a lower ionization state , and so is due to some other nuclear component .",
    "netzer ( 1996 ) has modeled x - ray absorbers in a similar way to mathur et al .",
    "( 1995 ) but predicts that the uv lines will show n(nv)@xmath22n(civ ) , in contradiction to the observations of ngc5548 , and concludes that two separate absorbers are needed in ngc5548 .",
    "however , netzer uses a continuum with very steep euv slope .",
    "the observed continuum of ngc5548 instead gives n(nv)@xmath23n(civ ) ( mathur et al .",
    ", 1995 ) , as observed .",
    "this illustrates the danger of comparing results using differing assumptions .    our model , together with",
    "the reverberation mapping variability constraints , leads us to understand the physical properties of the absorber .",
    "the absorber is highly ionized , has high column density , low density , and is situated outside the civ emitting region the gas is outflowing with a mean velocity of 1200@xmath24 ( relative to the host , heckman 1978 ) , and has a corresponding kinetic luminosity of @xmath25 . a scenario",
    "in which the absorbing material comes off a disk , and is accelerated by the radiation pressure of the continuum source may explain the observed properties of the absorber",
    ".    we can now generalize our unification of uv and x - ray absorbing outflows from the lobe dominated radio - loud quasars to include radio - quiet seyfert galaxies .",
    "this may also provide a link to the radio - quiet balqsos , which show unexpectedly strong x - ray absorption ( mathur , elvis & singh 1996 , green & mathur 1996 ) .",
    "this analogy suggests that the x - ray / uv absorbers in radio - quiet agn may be viewed close to edge - on , which would be a valuable known parameter if it can be independently supported .",
    "a few rosat pspc spectra of high redshift ( z@xmath263 ) quasars showed strong low energy cut - offs , suggesting strong obscuration ( elvis et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "a search of the whole pspc pointed archive ( fiore et al . , 1996 )",
    "has now shown that only radio - loud quasars have x - ray colors suggesting cut - offs ; so _ low energy x - ray cut - offs are associated with the quasars _ , and not with intervening systems ( since those would affect radio - quiet and radio - loud equally ) . moreover , among radio - loud quasars those at high redshift are more cut - off than those at low z ; so _ the x - ray cut - offs show evolution with cosmic epoch . _",
    "investigating the optical and radio properties of the 11 quasars with rosat cut - offs ( elvis et al . , 1996 )",
    "we find that _ all _ have associated absorption lines in their optical / ultraviolet spectra and/or show reddening associated with the quasar .",
    "we conclude that _ absorption is highly likely to be the cause of the x - ray cut - offs _ too .",
    "the implied x - ray column densities are a few@xmath27  @xmath4 .",
    "there are several trends within the sample : going from low to high redshift and luminosity we find a related change from low to high ionization , and from low to high compactness ( as indicated by radio size and cut - off frequency ) .",
    "interestingly , the ionization parameter and column densities are similar to those expected from a large ` cooling flow ' ionized by a quasar .",
    "even these pressures are insufficient to thermally confine the radio sources , but ram pressure can slow down their expansion .",
    "the suggestive picture that emerges is of radio sources that are both young and frustrated ( fanti 1990 ) by a high pressure surrounding medium .",
