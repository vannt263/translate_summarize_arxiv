    "observational evidence indicates that the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) is correlated with the luminosity ( marconi & hunt , 2003 and references therein ) and velocity dispersion ( tremaine et al . , 2002 and references therein ) of the host spheroids , suggesting that the process that leads to the formation of galaxies must be intimately linked to the growth of the central smbh . studying low redshift agn , heckman et al .",

    "under the standard assumption that black holes grow mainly by accretion , their cosmic evolution can be calculated from the luminosity function of agn @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the bolometric luminosity produced by a smbh accreting at a rate of @xmath2 with a _ radiative _ efficiency @xmath3 ( soltan 1982 ) .",
    "following the discussion in mrd04 , we will assume that the absorption corrected 2 - 10 kev luminosity function of agn , @xmath4 , ( la franca et al .",

    "its radiative efficiency , instead , critically depends on the nature of the flow : if powerful outflows / jets are capable of removing the excess energy which is not radiated , as , for example , in the adios scenario ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) , then @xmath14=1 , and black hole are always efficient radiators _ with respect to the accreted mass _ ( `` black holes are green !

    "although clearly correlated with the stellar mass density , smbh accretion does not exactly track either the spheroid nor the total star assembly : irrespective of the exact mass budget in spheroids and disks  @xmath44  irregulars , the ratio of the total or spheroid stellar to black hole mass density was lower at higher redshift .",
    "our results also suggest that the fraction of stars locked up into the non - spheroidal components of galaxies and in irregular galaxies should increase with increasing redshift ( @xmath45 , see mrd04 for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "our version of the soltan argument yields a well defined constraint on the average radiative efficiency , and a corresponding one for the total accretion efficiency ( i.e. on the mean mass - weighted smbh spin ) , only weakly dependent on the uncertain physics of low @xmath43 accretion flows ."
