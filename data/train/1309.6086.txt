    "the standard model describes particle physics in great detail . nonetheless in the past",
    "most work has been based on the assumption , with varying motivations , that the standard model must be incomplete and that new physics should be just around the corner . with the new data from the lhc it seems reasonable to question this assumption .",
    "the fact that the lhc has found no evidence for new physics puts strong constraints on possible extensions . for instance , the fact that lhcb finds full agreement with standard model predictions basically rules out any new form of flavor physics at accessible scales .",
    "also direct searches have found no sign for new physics , deep into the tev scale .",
    "the analysis of the higgs boson properties is an eminent goal of the physics at the lhc .",
    "the data show a resonance at 125  that is consistent with a standard model higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "however there is still a considerable uncertainty on the value of the overall coupling strength to the different particles in the theory",
    ". therefore constraints on the presence of extra states mixed with the higgs boson are relatively mild .    the two - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the with the present central value for the higgs mass do not lead to a theory that is stable up to the planck scale  @xcite ( see , however ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this statement is strongly dependent on the value of the top quark and higgs boson masses .",
    "based on old ideas , a number of studies in the light of recent developments have reinforced the picture that simple scalar extensions can relax this tension and lead to a theory that is stable up to very large mass - scales , either via tree - level mixing  @xcite or as new thresholds in the running of the quartic coupling  @xcite .",
    "another major point of interest in the running of the higgs coupling is the fact , that the vanishing of the higgs quartic coupling at the planck scale sets the lower bound on the higgs mass when related to inflation ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present letter we investigate at the two - loop level whether the hill model can improve the validity range of the .",
    "further , we begin the analysis of its extension , the heidi model , by constraining the parameter space of the latter compatible with inflation in view of the higgs boson discovery at the lhc .    this letter is organized as follows : in the next section we describe the hill model and give the one - loop rges of the model parameters . in section  [",

    "the scalar potential reads @xmath3    a defining feature of the hill model is the absence of @xmath1 self - interactions , as well as @xmath4 terms , so there are only two new parameters .",
    "the fact that the extra interaction is superrenormalizable leads to a limited impact on the renormalization group , whose study is the aim of this letter .",
    "the beta function for the  higgs coupling stays untouched , which makes it possible to study it at @xmath5 loops while still considering new physics at @xmath6 loop , as discussed in the next section .",
    "moreover , the absence of @xmath1 self - interactions is a key feature that allows for an extension to higher - dimensional ( heidi ) fields in a renormalizable way up to six dimensions , to be discussed in section  [ sec : heidi ] .",

    "the mass eigenstates @xmath15 couple to the particles with an overall @xmath16 prefactor and have masses @xmath17 where we have defined @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the mixing angle is given by @xmath21    eqs .",

    "the presence of the hill singlet modifies the contribution solely of the real higgs field , via tree - level mixing , while leaving all the rest untouched .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to replace the real higgs contribution in the one - loop scalar potential with the following term : @xmath25\\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] in which the field - dependent mass now reads as a matrix ; @xmath26 with @xmath27 being a real field . the condition of minimization of the tree - level potential fixes the parameter @xmath28 , and we defined @xmath29 imposing the condition that the improved potential does not depend on the renormalization scale yields the rges for @xmath30 @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the anomalous dimension of the higgs boson at one loop .",

    "we identify @xmath37 , the lighter mass eigenstate , with the scalar boson as observed at the lhc , with a mass of 125 .",
    "the mass of the second boson and the mixing angle @xmath14 are our free parameters .",
    "we have thus @xmath38 we will call the particle with mass of 125 the -like higgs boson , and the other one the hill field , with mass @xmath39 .",
    "the labels @xmath37 , @xmath40 and their corresponding masses will be employed accordingly .",
    "the rges from the previous section are solved numerically , identifying the regions in parameter space that comply with the following conditions : @xmath41 where the left-/right - hand side is usually referred to as the `` vacuum stability''/``triviality '' condition .",
    "their meaning is that the condition of perturbativity and the existence of a well - defined vacuum of the model must be fulfilled at any scale @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the ultimate scale of validity of the theory . in this letter , we take @xmath44 .",
    "both conditions have been chosen somewhat restrictive in order to show that the model under consideration is a simple extension that is viable up to the planck scale , and to identify the tightest possible bounds in parameter space .",
    "relaxing these conditions ( e.g. , considering @xmath45 or increasing the perturbativity bound ) will lead to results for which our findings are a valid subset . the allowed parameter space is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_hill-2 ] .",
    "as remarked earlier , the rge for the quartic coupling reads as in the .",
    "however , the  higgs boson is now mixed with the hill field , which will affect the former running . strictly speaking",
    ", a threshold effect appears at the mass of the new particle ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which should be treated with care . if the difference between the mass threshold and the initial energy scale is much smaller than the range in energy that is considered , one could in first approximation use for all energies the modified rges , since the numerical difference with and without threshold effect is very small . in this letter",
    "we consider hill boson masses below 1 tev , and evolve the rges all the way up to the planck scale : it is then a justified approximation to consider the impact of the hill boson on the boundary condition for the  quartic coupling instead of the full treatment of the threshold effect .",
    "hence , in first approximation , it is possible to improve on the previous study by considering the two - loop rges of the integrated by the one - loop equations for the hill parameters from the previous section , and consider the effect of the hill boson on the solely in eq .",

    "we compare the previous results to the experimental constraints , given by cms  @xcite .",
    "we point out that these bounds come from the standard higgs searches applied to the heavy scalar .",
