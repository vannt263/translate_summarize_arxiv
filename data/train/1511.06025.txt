    "the visual aspect of black holes is a frequent public outreach question but for decades , did not generate much interest among physicists or astronomers .",
    "a somewhat caricatural example of this is given by s.  chandrasekhar famous book on black holes  @xcite , where the visual aspect of a schwarzschild black hole is summarized in a tiny picture on page  130 , the caption of which being rather pedantic and obscure for a non expert reader since the author does not describe the picture as a sketch of the angular size of a schwarzschild black hole as a function of the distance of a static observer , but rather talks about the `` cone of avoidance '' of null geodesics ( which technically means the same thing ) .",
    "still , the problem of black hole visualization had already drawn some sparse attention at the time of chandrasekhar book in the more difficult context of the kerr metric , the earliest work being that of bardeen in 1972  @xcite and later luminet  @xcite .",
    "an increasing number of work were published afterward , a very incomplete subset of which lies in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the recent years , a much larger amount of work has been peformed on black hole visualization .",
    "the main reason for this growing interest came from obvious astronomical constraints : the largest black hole ( in term of angular size ) seen from earth , sgr  a * , has an angular diameter of order of 60  @xmath0as , which is unobservable by convential astronomical devices , but which should be at reach within less than a decade with the advent of long baseline interferometry in the millimetric domain , thus making the actual aspect of a black hole silhouette become a problem of astronomical relevance .",
    "consequently , most of those recent works are motivated by actual astrophysical observational projects of our galactic center such as gravity  @xcite or the event horizon telescope  @xcite , see , e.g. , @xcite , but some others were focused on what could be seen if an observer stood close to a black hole   @xcite thus being less relevant from an observational perspetive , but more focused on the diversity of physical effects that can arise in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "our work fits in this second category .",
    "the case of special relativity is much simpler and has deserved an earlier attention as early as 70 years ago with the pioneering sketches of gamow  @xcite .",
    "( although it is often said that special relativity was also a source of artistic inspiration for s.  dali in his famous painting `` la persistncia de la memoria '' ( the persistence of memory , 1931 ) , it actually does not seem to be the case  @xcite . ) the increasingly easier access to large computing facilities has progressively allowed the completion of excellent works by , for example ruder and nollert  @xcite or searle _ et al . _",

    "the aim of this paper is to present here a numerical code that implements most of the relativistic effects that arise when simulating what an observer would see in a black hole metric , focusing here on the schwarzschild one .",
    "the schwarzshild metric is the simplest black hole metric that exists .",
    "it is both astrophysically relevant ( contrarily to the reissner - nordstrom one ) and simple to study thanks to its spherical symmetry ( contrarily to the kerr on kerr - newmann metrics ) .",
    "in particular , as we shall see , it is possible to perform a rather nice and efficient rendering of pointlike light sources ( i.e. , stars ) thanks to spherical symmetry , an issue which was not addressed satisfactorily till now .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the camera ( i.e. the way to project a part of the celestial sphere on a two - dimensional screen ) is described in sec .",
    "[ sec_cam ] .",
    "we then address the way to simulate the way a background sky is distorted both by special relativistic effects and the presence of a gravitational field ( sec .",
    "[ sec_cel1 ] ) .",
    "this first , naive method can be significantly improved in term of computational time as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec_cel2 ] .",
    "the results of this section are then used to make a very rapid and satisfactory rendering of the stars ( or any pointlike light source ) , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec_stars ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec_data ] , we list all the data that we use in order to produce images , some examples of which are shown in sec .  [ sec_img ] .",

    "[ sec_conc ] .    in",
    "what follows , we shall use the @xmath1 convention for the metric signature .",
    "we place ourselves in a coordinates systems such that @xmath2 , and keep the second as time unit , so that a distance of @xmath3 corresponds to one light second ( i.e. approximatively  @xmath4 ) and a mass of @xmath3 corresponds to around @xmath5 solar masses . unless otherwise specified we shall place ourselves in a spherical version of the so - called schwarzschild coordinates , where the line element is written @xmath6",
    "we assume that the images we want to simulate are those that would be seen by an observer is endowed with a four velocity @xmath7 that either result from a chosen trajectory ( possibly following a geodesic or not ) or from any user defined data .",
    "we do not take into account the fact that the observer is unlikely to survive to his / her journey within the black hole metric either because of arbitrarily large acceleration iposed by some non geodesic motion or because of arbitrarily large tidal effects endured close or wthin a black hole of sufficiently small mass .",
    "we simulate here standard image and do not address the interesting issue of stereoscopic vision as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the camera orientation is described by a set of three unit orthogonal spacelike vectors , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 all of which are orthogonal to @xmath7 .",
    "we define the orientation of the camera by the following assumptions :    * any pixel of the screen can be seen as pointing toward a spacelike direction @xmath11 belonging to the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 hyperplane , where @xmath12 , i.e. , a photon hitting the screen coming from this direction possesses a wave vector proportional to @xmath13 , which is evidently a null vector ; * the @xmath10 direction points toward the center of the screen , i.e. photons hitting the center of the screen possesses a wavevector proportional to @xmath14 ; * the @xmath8 direction is associated to the central horizontal line of the screen in the sense that any photon hitting this part of the screen possesses a wavevector proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , the value of @xmath17 and @xmath18 being determined by the pixel position and the choice of projection ( see below ) ; * the @xmath9 direction is associated to the central vertical line of the screen in the sense that any photon hitting this part of the screen possesses a wavevector proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 ( same remark as for @xmath17 and @xmath18 above ) .    the exact association between a pixel of coordinates @xmath21 and the corresponding direction @xmath22 is somewhat arbitrary and depends on the choice of projection we want to use . a natural choice is spherical projection , which reproduces the exact view on the screen provided that the person viewing the screen is set at the proper position with respect to it , that depends on the view opening angle .",
    "when not at the proper position , any shape on the screen becomes distorted .",
    "for example , the circular silhouette of a schwarzschild black hole no longer appears circular . in order to evade this problem",
    ", a natural choice corresponds to stereographic projection for which the circular shape of the black hole silhouette is always a circle on the screen .",
    "if one denotes @xmath23 the opening angle of the picture along the horizontal direction , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 the number of rows and columns of the screen then the pixel coordinates @xmath21 of a given direction @xmath11 is given by @xmath26 ( the minus sign at the denominator of each formula comes from the signature convention we adopt here . ) we assume here that the pixel coordinates ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath25 in along the horizontal direction , number @xmath3 being on the left , and from @xmath3 to @xmath24 in the vertical direction , from top to bottom . in the usual case where both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are even , the center of the screen ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) does not correspond to a pixel but to the common corner of the four adjacent central pixels of coordinates @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume that pixels are perfectly square , i.e , that pixel aspect ratio is exactly 1 . in the case where one produces pictures with",
    "non square pixels such as for standard video formats ( e.g. , 576i  4:3 , which has a pixel ratio of 12:11 ) , then one has to rescale the second formula  ( [ pix_j ] ) along the vertical direction according to the imposed pixel ratio .",
    "the inverse transform that allows to compute the direction @xmath11 as a function of pixel coordinates can be written in two steps by defining the intermediate quantity @xmath32 , @xmath33 , \\\\",
    "n^\\mu & = & - z^\\mu - 2 \\frac{w^\\mu}{w_\\mu w^\\mu } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , the way one defines the vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is done as follows :    * we start from what we call a reference tetrad that is defined for each event of the spacetime .",
    "this tetrad is orthonormal and is made of one timelike vector @xmath34 and three spacelike vectors @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the label of which are of course related to the coordinate system  ( [ ds2 ] ) ( see later ) . * all these vectors",
    "are lorentz transformed according to the unique lorentz boost @xmath38 that transforms the tetrad timelike vector @xmath34 into the observer s velocity @xmath7 and leaves invariant any vector orthogonal to both of them .",
    "* the three spacelike vector obtained after performing the lorentz boost on @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are then rotated by a space rotation @xmath42 that leaves @xmath7 invariant in order to give the three camera vectors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "simple algebra allows to prove that the @xmath38 components are ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) : @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 as the lorentz factor @xmath48 so that one indeed has @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as expected .    before computing",
    "the components of this matrix one of course has to define those of the reference tetrad vectors .",
    "a natural choice can be to use a normalized version of the standard spherical schwarzschild coordinates ( i.e. , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and so on ) , however such a choice is only valid outside the black hole , since the then defined @xmath34 would no longer be timelike within the black hole .",
    "it is therefore more appropriate to define the tetrad that can be associated to a freely falling observer starting from infinity with zero velocity and zero angular momentum .",
    "such an observer four velocity will correspond to the vector @xmath34 .",
    "then we define @xmath35 as the unique unit spacelike vector spanned by @xmath53 and @xmath54 that is orthogonal to @xmath34 and that reduces to @xmath55 at infinity .",
    "we keep @xmath36 and @xmath37 unchanged as compared to the first ansatz above .",
    "one then obtain directly the following components @xmath56 this tetrad is defined everywhere , regardless one is inside or outside the black hole ( except , of course , at @xmath57 ) .",
    "however , it is not valid everywhere if one explores the full analytical extension of the metric . in this case , if one denotes i our asymptotic region , ii the black hole interior beyond the future event horizon ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , iii the other asymptotic region and iv the region beyon the past event horizon , then the signs of both @xmath58 and @xmath59 must be reversed in region  iv and the signs of both @xmath60 and @xmath61 must be reversed in region  iii .",
    "regarding the rotation @xmath62 , we do not compute its components explicitely .",
    "rather , we define its three associated euler angle . we first rotate @xmath63 and @xmath64 by an angle @xmath65 around @xmath66 .",
    "then , we rotate the newly obtained @xmath67 and @xmath66 by and angle @xmath68 around the newly obtained @xmath69 , and finally , we perform a new rotation by an angle @xmath70 around the new @xmath71 . in other words , we process along the following sequence : @xmath72",
    "as stated above , any photon seen originating from unit spacelike direction @xmath11 orthogonal to the observer velocity @xmath7 is endowed with a wave vector proportional to @xmath73 . once such vector is defined ( up to some unimportant proportionality constant ) , knowing from which direction on the celestial sphere it originates amounts to propagate it backward in time ( i.e. backward in its affine parameter @xmath74 ) the geodesic equation @xmath75 where the @xmath76 are the usual christoffel symbols .",
    "if one works in the usual schwarzschild spherical coordinates , then this set of equations is written as @xmath77 where we have set @xmath78 and where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the @xmath79 coordinate ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) .",
    "these equation have of course to be solved together with the position equation : @xmath81 in practice , this set of equations is solved using an adaptative 4@xmath82 order runge - kutta method inspired from the numerical recipes  @xcite .",
    "one step that has to be implemented with some care is the choice of the time step .",
    "as we will see later , two numerically tricky zones lie at @xmath83 ( horizon crossing ) and @xmath84 ( light circle crossing , where radial motion can be slow and unstable whereas orthoradial motion must be carefully computed ; see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , the timestep choice is essentially given by the following choices :    * if the geodesic is recessing away from the black hole ( when propagated backward in time ) with @xmath79 already larger than @xmath85 , the timestep is chosen proportional to @xmath86 , so that infinity ( or , in practice , a very large value of @xmath87 ) is reached after a few steps ( typically 4 or 5 ) ; * if the geodesic approaches the black hole , then one chooses a timestep proportional to @xmath88 ; * if one lies within the @xmath89 sphere , then a sufficiently small timestep is chosen so as to insure both stability of the integration and monitoring a possible horizon crossing ( see later ) .",
    "if one is outside the black hole and if we do not consider the maximal analytic extension of the metric , then this equation has to be solved only when the geodesics originates from infinity . by setting the constants of motion @xmath90 and @xmath91 by their standard definition ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath92 then the geodesic equation needs to be computed if and only if    1 .",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 , or 2 .   @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "( since this is a fairly well - known result we just recall it here , but for the sake of completeness derive it in appendix . )",
    "if none of these conditions are satisfied , this means that the geodesic originates from the past event horizon , or , from an astrophysically realistic point of view , from the infinitely redshifted surface of the collapsing object which gave birth to the black hole as it was passing through the horizon . if one does not work within the maximal analytic extension of the metric",
    ", then such geodesics do not carry any photon and the corresponding pixel is black .",
    "if , on the contrary , one works in the maximal analytic extension , then the geodesic can be propagated back to the past singularity and imaged provided one decides of some emission properties of the past singularity .    for geodesics originating from infinity ,",
    "one obtains at the end of integration a wavevector @xmath97 whose only non negligible components are @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the two others tending to 0 when @xmath79 tends to infinity because of angular momentum conservation .",
    "regarding the position , @xmath79 and @xmath100 both tend to minus infinity with their difference @xmath101 being almost constant , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 tend to be constant .",
    "this is because as long as the radial coordinate @xmath79 is much larger than the impact parameter @xmath104 , the geodesic can be considered as ( almost ) purely radial and originating from the direction defined by the above mentioned @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , one can compute the redshift @xmath105 of the photons we receive .",
    "this is done through the standard formula @xmath106 where the numerator is evaluated ( as the subscript indicates ) at infinity , whereas the denominator is computed at observer s position before integration .",
    "note that this formula include both the kinetic and gravitational redshift .",
    "once the initial direction of the photon and the redshift are known , we can draw the corresponding pixel .",
    "the set  ( [ deb_ode1][fin_ode1 ] ) is valid only when geodesics do not cross the horizon .",
    "therefore , if the observer is within the horizon , it is not possible to simulate what he / she sees of the celestial sphere using these equations . in order to do so",
    ", one has to use another system of coordinates , the most natural of which being that of kruskal . in this case , the subset of coordinates @xmath107 have to be replaced by the subset @xmath108 defined by the following procedure .",
    "first , we define the so - called `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath109 by @xmath110 so that @xmath111 here , @xmath109 is a growing function of @xmath79 outside the horizon and a decreasing function of @xmath79 inside ( regardless one considers the maximal analytic extension or not ) . then , we define @xmath112 and @xmath113 such as @xmath114 and finally @xmath115 and @xmath116 are defined through @xmath117 the constant @xmath118 are then chosen so that both @xmath115 and @xmath116 grow with any observer proper time or grow with any null geodesics affine parameter when it grows as the geodesic is propagated in the future . their value are summarized in table  [ table_eps_eta ] .",
    ".values of the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 as defined in eqns  ( [ defu][defv ] ) .",
    "their value allow the null coordinates @xmath115 and @xmath116 to with proper time regardless the observer position within the maximal extension of the schwarzschild metric . which of the variable @xmath100 or @xmath79 of the standard schwarschild coordinates that is bound to grow or decrease with proper time from any timelike geodesics is also given . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this choice for @xmath119 and @xmath120 also possesses the nice property to ensure that the product @xmath121 can be expressed as a function of @xmath79 only , without any reference to @xmath119 or @xmath120   has the same sign as @xmath122 so that it compensate to absolute value that arises in the definition of @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ def_rstar ] ) ] : @xmath123 this being set , the geodesic equation  ( [ deb_ode1][fin_ode1 ] ) has then to be replaced by the following set of equations @xmath124 where we have set @xmath125 @xmath126 being defined in eq .",
    "( [ def_a ] ) and where we have used the following intermediate quantities @xmath127 in which @xmath128 denotes the derivative of @xmath129 with respect to @xmath79 , which is quite straightforwardly deduced from eq .",
    "( [ res_uv ] ) and can be written as @xmath130 since @xmath128 only appears when multiplied by @xmath126 the set of equation is regular at horizon crossing .",
    "the set of variables @xmath131 is well suited for horizon crossing and is in principle defined everywhere on the maximal analytic extension of the manifold . in practice",
    "it is however not possible to use it everywhere since the exponential dependence of both @xmath115 and @xmath116 in term of @xmath79 and @xmath100 make it numerically impossible to use as soon as one goes a few schwarzschild radii away from the black hole .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following procedure in order to choose the coordinate system :    * from the knowledge of constants @xmath90 and @xmath91 and position , we determine whether the geodesic we are interested in has any chance to cross horizon ; * if not , then we use the schwarzschild coordinates @xmath132 ; * if so , then we check whether one is close to the horizon ; * if not , then we keep the schwarschild coordinates ; * if so , then we switch to kruskal coordinates ; * then we keep on using kruskal coordinates till horizon has been crossed , in which case we switch back to schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "the only arbitrariness here lies in where exactly we decide to switch from one coordinate system to the other . in practice ,",
    "the radial motion of photon is determined by and effective potential @xmath133 given in eq .",
    "( [ def_pot ] ) . this potential show that in some case , a geodesic may spend a large amount of time around @xmath134 ( the so - called light circle )",
    "around which the one dimensional radial motion is unstable .",
    "therefore , we choose to impose that the light circle crossing is made using schwarschild coordinates @xmath132 .      in a perfectly realistic situation , we would have at our disposal a spectral map of the celestial sphere , i.e. , spectroscopic data for each direction of it",
    ". then we would modify the spectrum according to the computed redshift and then compute the eye response to that observed spectrum and then deduce the corresponding rgb coordinates of the pixel . in practice , such a precision is rarely taken into account .",
    "many papers focus on the aspect of an accretion disk and do not care about the celestial sphere itself , while others care only with stars . in practice ,",
    "when one wants to include a celestial sphere as a background image distorted but the black hole , one often uses a pixellized version from full sky picture of our sky , whether realistic or computer generated , but which is does not include any spectral information ( apart from its color ) .",
    "this therefore gives the correct colors of the sky seen by the observer only when redshift is negligible as such procedure does not allow to compute the color or intensity change of the celestial sphere due to the redshift is not possible but this can compensated by various visual artifacts .",
    "on the contrary , it is possible to define by hand the spectral information for each direction of the celestial sphere . this allows to have a perfect rendering of the influence of the redshift , but possibly at the cost of performing a less aesthetic rendering of the sky . in what follows",
    ", we shall use both approaches .",
    "in the section above , the number of geodesic equations we have to solve is equal to the number of pixels of the screen and can therefore easily reach several millions and severely affect the computational time for each picture .",
    "the situation is worsened by the fact that some smoothing may be necessary when computing the image , i.e. , one may need to split one pixel into several subpixels , compute the color of all of them and average the result accordingly .",
    "such a large number of integrations of the geodesic equation is actually not necessary because , as is well known , null geodesics are described by a single parameter , which can be taken to be the impact parameter @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , we are considering a situation where the only information about the geodesics we are interested in is the amount of deflection the photon trajectory experiences between the direction it travels at the observer s position and the direction it was traveling at infinity .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following procedure :    * before computing the image , we solve the geodesics equation for a freely falling observer ( the one that defines our reference tetrad , with four - velocity @xmath34 ) for all possible angles @xmath136 between the geodesic and the radial direction",
    ". this amounts to sample , in a more appropriate way , all the values of the geodesic impact parameter . * for each of these geodesics we obtain the angle @xmath137 by which the geodesics has been deflected .",
    "* we sample this quantity sufficiently by computing a moderately large number of geodesics so that the both functions @xmath138 and its inverse @xmath139 are well sampled . * then , for each pixel of the image , compute the angle @xmath136 between the corresponding null geodesic and the radial direction , and identify the plane into which the photon trajectory lies . *",
    "we rotate within this plane the observer position by an angle @xmath140 so as to identify the point of the celestial sphere the photon originates from . *",
    "we compute the rgb coordinates of the pixel one had to draw following the selected assumptions for redshift rendering .",
    "the angle @xmath136 we use here is defined with respect to a freely falling observer .",
    "this means that it is given by the formula @xmath141 or , equivalently , this means that we will integrate a bunch of geodesics whose wavevector @xmath142 is defined as @xmath143 with an appropriate sampling of @xmath136 . with this definition ,",
    "a radial geodesic originating from the black hole past horizon is described by an angle @xmath144 , and a radial geodesic originating from infinity is described by @xmath145 . because of spherical symmetry , when we compute the @xmath138 fonction , we can place ourselves in the equatorial plane at the same @xmath79 coordinate as the observer and by considering equatorial geodesics only that start from the @xmath146 axis ( i.e. , our freely falling fiducial observer lies at coordinates @xmath147 and @xmath148 in eq .  ( [ def_k_prec ] ) ) . from this position and this wavevector",
    ", we propagate the geodesic backward in time till it reaches very large values of @xmath79 ( typically larger than @xmath149 ) .",
    "we then obtain the azimuthal angle @xmath150 with respect to the observer of the corresponding origin of the geodesic ( for example , @xmath151 for @xmath145 , and the angle @xmath152 is then given by @xmath153 should there be no aberration nor deflection of light , then one would just have @xmath154 regardless of the observer position and velocity .",
    "however this is not what happens here and the deflection experienced by any geodesic between its starting point at infinity and the moment it crosses the fiducial observer world line given by @xmath137 which is zero only when @xmath145 .",
    "an example of deviation function @xmath138 ( or , in fact , @xmath155 ) is given in figure  [ fig_dev ] .    .",
    "the one shown here was computed for a freely falling observer on a schwarzschild black hole at coordinate distance @xmath156 . in the absence of any relativistic effect ,",
    "the function @xmath157 would trivially reduce to @xmath158 , shown in dashed lines .",
    "but the adjunction of aberration ( since the observer is freely falling ) and light deflection modify it , only slightly away from the black hole ( @xmath136 close to @xmath159 ) , or much more importantly toward the black hole ( @xmath136 close to @xmath160 or @xmath161 ) .",
    "the black hole angular radius is given by the first value of @xmath136 for which @xmath150 diverges . here",
    ", the function was sampled so as to include values of @xmath162 slightly larger than @xmath163 , which is sufficient to include any visible ghost images of stars in most situations.,width=307 ]    note that the two angles @xmath136 and @xmath152 are associated to somewhat different contexts : @xmath136 is an angle defined by a freely falling oberver in the schwarzschild metric , whereas @xmath152 corresponds to an angle measured by a static observer in minkowski space whose origin and orientation matches that of the schwarzschild metric .    in practice ,",
    "sampling this @xmath138 function necessitates a few thousands of geodesics to be computed , i.e. a factor between @xmath164 and @xmath165 less than the brute force computation of the previous section .",
    "this situation is also enhanced by the fact that it suffices to perform the computation in the equatorial plane , so that , in practice , there is no need to consider the @xmath102 and @xmath166 variable in the ode system  ( [ deb_ode1][fin_ode1],[def_ode2 ] ) .",
    "then , once this deflection function is computed , all what we need to do rely on very simple trigonometric operations for all each pixel of the screen and some search in the deflection function @xmath167 pre - computed array .",
    "more importantly , the deviation function will further be used in the next section ( through its inverse ) in order to perform a very clean rendering of the stars .",
    "the main drawback of the sky rendering above is that it is not well suited to include point sources .",
    "a point source such as a star will never appear as perfectly pointlike .",
    "because of diffraction a point source will always appears as possessing a small but non zero angular size typically of circular shape ( and possibly diffraction patterns ) and can , in principle , belong to the pixellized version of the celestial sphere .",
    "however , when distorting the image of such a source , its appearance will also be distorted .",
    "as is well known , amplification due to gravitational lensing goes with a large amount of shear , so that an initially circular pattern will become quite elongated .",
    "this is not the way this source should appear because given the actual smallness of a star angular size , even in a strong lensing regime it should be considered a pointlike and its visual finite angular size would only result in the optical distortions caused by the observation apparatus .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to consider stars as `` points '' that would be `` impainted '' on the celestial sphere , and stars ( or any almost pointlike sources ) should be processed using a different procedure .",
    "since we work in a schwarzschild metric , any direction on the celestial sphere will possess an infinity of images seen from any observer point of view , even though most of these images will be extremely faint and close to the edge of the black hole silhouette . since the metric is spherically symmetric , any geodesic is planar and all the geodesics starting from the same point of the celestial sphere and reaching the observer belong to the same plane .",
    "what we initially know about a star is its position @xmath168 on the celestial sphere .",
    "we also know the observer position , and consequently we know the plane spanned by the observer , the black hole and the star , as well as the angle between the observer radial position and and star position , @xmath169 .",
    "we can choose the orientation of the star - observer - black hole plane so that @xmath170 lies between @xmath160 ( observer is between the star and the black hole ) and @xmath159 ( black hole is between the observer and the star ) .",
    "we can now invert the procedure outlined in the previous section , with the extra complication that for a given @xmath171 such that @xmath172 , there exists other values of @xmath136 that we shall note @xmath173 such that @xmath174 those are the ghost images of the star .",
    "there exists an infinity of such images as long as the function @xmath175 diverges , which is the case for the schwarzschild metric .",
    "these ghost images are not difficult to find numerically as long as the function @xmath175 is accurately sampled .",
    "we therefore can find without difficulty the apparent position of any ghost image of any star .",
    "this being done , we know the direction under which we see a given image of the star . however , because of both aberration and lensing , the actual ( microscopic ) angular size of the star will be different , and hence its luminosity . in order to take account for this , we shall define two directions very close to that where the star ( or , in fact , one of its image ) is seen . since we work here in the observer s frames ,",
    "the directions we are talking about can be expanded in term of the spacelike vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and can be considered as euclidean three - vectors which we shall write in bold notations and the direction into which the ( image of the ) star is seen will be written @xmath176 . in order to define two directions infinitesimally close to @xmath176 , we choose one direction @xmath177 that is different from @xmath176 .",
    "this can be for example either @xmath178 or @xmath179 ( one may choose the one among these two which has the smallest dot product with @xmath176 ) .",
    "then , we compute @xmath180 and then @xmath181 we then choose two small quantities @xmath182 and @xmath183 and define @xmath184 up to @xmath185 terms , these two vectors are units vectors that are very close to @xmath176 .",
    "now , it is obvious that the solid angle @xmath186 spanned by three directions @xmath176 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 is given by the formula @xmath189 equivalently , if we propagate the null geodesics which originate from these three direction till the celestial sphere , we obtain three direction on the celestial sphere , @xmath168 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 which span a solid angle @xmath192 given by @xmath193 with these notations , the amplification or desamplification factor @xmath194 induced both by lensing and aberation is simply writen as @xmath195 computing this factor numerically is in fact not necessary",
    ". there exists an analytical formula for amplification due to aberration , and the deflexion function @xmath138 ( or , in fact , the derivative of its inverse ) allows after some algebra to address the lensing part .",
    "however in practice this does not allow to perform significant enhancement in term of cpu time so that we wo nt address this here but rather keep it for future work .      in the two last subsections ,",
    "we explained how to determine the position of ( the image of ) a star on the observer s screen , in addition to its redshift and the amplification of its light because of aberration and lensing .",
    "for simplicity , we shall assume here that stars have a blackbody type emission whose temperature is given by their spectral type ( o and a being hotter , k and m cooler ) .",
    "if one wants to compute the colour perceived by human eye a given light source ( in term of , say , its rgb coordinate of a computer screen ) , one has to know the eye perception for each visible monochromatic frequency .",
    "these data are called the spectral tristimulus values are have been tabulated since a long time by the dedicated authority , the international commission on illumination ( cie )  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that eye response do not depend on light intensity , that is , we questionably assume that the observer s vision always works in diurnal ( photopic ) mode rather than in low brightness ( scotopic ) environment .",
    "this allows more colorful hues for stars than what we are used to . in any case , if one starts from a light source with a given spectrum , one can compute the rgb coordinates of this source by using the trichromatic tables delivered by the cie .    in practice , with the assuptions we make about the star spectra ,",
    "the procedure is the following :    1 .   prior to launching the code",
    ", we have processed our star catalog in order to transform each star s spectral type and magnitude in the v - band into a bolometric magnitude @xmath196 and a surface temperature @xmath197 .",
    "2 .   for each image of each star , we compute the corresponding redshift @xmath105 and amplification factor @xmath194 .",
    "we deduce that the star image possesses an apparent ( in the sense of observer - dependent ) bolometric magnitude and temperature given by @xmath198 4 .   with these new values , we compute the rgb coordinates of this image of the star .",
    "this being done , we have to decide how to simulate a pointlike light source with these rgb coordinates .",
    "since the source is supposed to the pointlike , the most natural choice is to add to the pixel where the star image is seen the rgb coordinates of the star to that of the already computed background .",
    "however , this naive assumption quickly leads to difficulties .",
    "the reason is that there is nothing that guarantees that the rgb coordinates are smaller than 1 , i.e. , that adding the star to this pixel will not saturate it .",
    "if they are not , putting all the luminosity of the star into a single pixel will truncate its true luminosity to the maximum that a pixel can draw and many bright star will have , in practice , identical magnitude because of the limitations of a computer screen .",
    "therefore , in order to allow recovering the whole luminosity range of observable stars , we draw them as extended blobs which are several pixel wide .",
    "we have found that a pleasant redering is obtained if our blob intensity profile looks like a truncated gaussians both in r , g , and b colors .",
    "this means that we impaint the already computed distorted celestial sphere by those blobs , imposing that the gaussians are centered on the actual position of the star ( not necessarily at the center of the pixel they belong to ) and by choosing their size so that their integrated luminosity corresponds to the one that has been computed . in other words ,",
    "the brighter the star , the larger the blob that represents it .",
    "this procedure is inspired by the beautiful pictures made by famous amateur astronomer akira fuji  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) which are obtain by putting a diffusing filter in front of the camera so as to artificially spread a bright star images on some extended area of the picture in order to more faithfully reproduce the luminosity contrast between faint and bright stars .    in order to reproduce the most satisfactoy rendering of the stars , some cooking is necessary here .",
    "for example , its appears less artificial to saturate the centre of the blobs that represent bright stars , so that its color is less saturated than the edge of the blob which reproduces more faithfully the star color . also , it appears that when performing videos , a faint stars slowly crossing the screen appears more easthetic if one imposes that its blob is always at least a few pixel wide in diameter even if the center of the blob is then not saturated .",
    "even if there are obviously some `` artistic '' choices that are made here ( apologizing in advance that not every reader will agree with them ! ) , we insist on the fact that the really physically significant quantities that are needed , @xmath199 and @xmath200 are computed as accurately as possible , so that we have very carefully splitted the problem into its physical content ( @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) and its representational content ( how to associate a colored blob to these two quantities ) .",
    "for pedagogical purposes , a celestial sphere made of a coordinate grid is by far sufficient . in what follows",
    "we have defined a celestial sphere under the form of a checkerboard structure of @xmath201  degrees both in latitude and longitude .",
    "the two type squares ( `` light '' ) and ( `` dark '' ) all correspond to blackbody type emission but with same temperature ( @xmath202 ) but different intensity ( a factor @xmath203 between light and dark squares ) . in order to avoid thinner and almost triangular squares toward the pole ,",
    "the polar regions are covered by discs of @xmath201  degrees in diameter wich are both redder ( @xmath204 ) and brighter .    for aesthetic rendering and/or astronomical outreach use ,",
    "it is by far better to use a celestial sphere that looks like a real one . the simple way to obtain this is by using actual pictures of the sky seen from earth .",
    "many such high resolution pictures of this exist .",
    "one of the most famous is the one made by a.  mellinger some time ago  @xcite , at the same epoch as the one made by s.  brunier  @xcite .",
    "unsurprisingly , the latter was much advertised in french speaking countries , whereas the former was mostly known in the rest of the world .",
    "independently however of the astonishing quality of these two pictures , both suffer from the fact that stars are part of the pictures in the sense that their appear to be impainted on the celestial sphere .",
    "this is not satisfactory for the reasons given in sec .",
    "[ sec_stars ] .",
    "for this reason , it is better to look for a full sky picture of the celestial sphere whose star have been removed . whether or not this could be done starting from these existing and highly star crowded pictures is not known to the author , however this was achieved in a rather clean way by the 2mass collaboration which produced a starless picture of the celestial sphere  @xcite .",
    "it seems that the pictures is not actually `` starless '' , but that the luminosity of each pixel was computed by averaging the luminosity of the stars over some windows function .",
    "the picture obtained in this way is of moderate size ( @xmath205 pixels ) corresponding ( once borders are removed ) to a resolution of around @xmath206 per pixel .",
    "this is a factor @xmath207 coarser that the natural resolution of human eye , however , for practical purposes , what is of interest is the ratio between the digital resolution of the produced images and that of the images that are used for rendering .",
    "if one considers normal ( for modern screen standards ) pictures of around @xmath208 pixel wide corresponding to a view computed with an opening angle of @xmath209  degrees , then the theoretical resolution of such a picture is around  @xmath210 which is only marginally better than the 2mass picture , which is therefore is sufficient for many purposes .",
    "this picture suffers however from small but noticeable problems .",
    "the most obvious one is that the lower border is missing on a width of a few pixels , so that one has to complete the missing part by some ( rather arbitrary ) procedure .",
    "the second one is that the 2mass project has observed the sky in the infrared bands and the structure of the milky way is somewhat affected by this .",
    "the most noticeable difference comes from the fact that there is far less absorption , especially in the direction of the galactic centre which appears much more regular and more symetric with respect to the galactic plane than in optical images .",
    "also , since this picture is unavoidably made in false colors , the overall hue does not correspond to visible image , notable the milky way band which is both brighter a has much more yellowish hue than what human eye is used to .",
    "finally , since the image is already given in term of a planar projection and its pixellisation follows this projection .",
    "when viewed in a spherical context , then the underlying pixellisation of the image appears more or less elongated depending on the direction of observation .",
    "this is particularily true at the joining of the two edges of the pictures some quite visible and unaesthetic patterns are visible on the bare image .",
    "regarding the stars , visual inspection of simulated images shows that the more stars , the more spectacular the result is .",
    "we therefore need a large , uniform and magnitude limited catalog comprising at least several @xmath211 stars .",
    "we have chosen to use the electronic version of the henry draper catalogue with its extension  @xcite , that were initially published by a.  j.  cannon and e.  w.  pickering between 1918 and 1924 .",
    "this catalog comprises more than 250,000 stars . for high magnitudes , it is not uniform , some regions of the sky having a deeper coverage ( the galactic anticenter , among others ) .",
    "we therefore truncate up to some magnitude around 9 . after this , some hand made change have to be performed because the magnitude of some binary star systems are not given and this happens for some easily noticeable stars such as @xmath212  lyrae .    for very high resolution images",
    ", we also have used the ascc catalogue of around 2.5  million stars  @xcite .      with the described implementation , the typical computational time for a single high resolution image",
    "is split in equal proportion between the few thousand geodesic calculation sampling the deflection function @xmath138 , and drawing the stars pixel by pixel along the lines described above .",
    "typical images of one million pixel initially computed at a twice larger resolution and then smoothed needed in the first versions of our code needed one minute of single cpu time to be computed . assuming one makes a movies at 25 of 30 frames per second , one second of the movie can be computed in less than half an hour , thus allowing to obtain a one minute long movie in less than one cpu day .",
    "in some situations however , most notably when large portions of the sky experience a large blueshift ( for example , a freely falling observer within the horizon and approaching the singularity or static observer close to the horizon ) , the cpu time is dominated by the star drawing , something which is far from being optized , thus reducing the length of the movie that could be made in one cpu day .",
    "however , we did not meet any critical cpu issues here .",
    "moreover , since any frame can be computed independently of the others , we did not have any need of parallelization .",
    "it was in practice simpler to launch by hand our code to compute a few hundreds of frame per computer , and then to split the not so numerous hard - to - compute frames after they had been identified .",
    "the methods that we have outlined can now be implemented to compute high quality images of black holes in various situations , and to explore the unexpected variety of special and general relativistic effects that one would visually experience close to a black hole . for pedagogical purpose",

    "note also that the background sky is much brighter , as expected.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    , except that periastron now occurs at @xmath316 , which necessitates an initial velocity greater than @xmath317 . on the top picture ,",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]      as long as the observer lies outise the horizon , any calculation can be done in the standard schwarzschild coordinates , although this is not necessaily what we do in practice .",
    "such a coordinate choice is nolonger possible when the observer is within the horizon since all the null geodesics he or she intersects have crossed the horizon and consequently have locally necessitated to use another coordinate system .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fighor ] three views of a radial geodesic trajectory starting from inifnity and plunging into the black hole .",
    "several interesting features can be seen from those images :    * firstly , the angular size of the black hole is rather small at horizon crossing .",
    "this comes from the fact that an observer wh is about to cross the horizon has a very large relative velocity with respect to a static observer close to the horizon .",
    "this means that the view seen by the former experiences a very strong aberration phenomenon with respect to the view seen by the latter , thus drastically reducing the black hole angular size . in order to determine the angular size of the black hole",
    ", one needs to know which angle @xmath136 a geodesic with critical impact parameter @xmath318 makes with respect to the radial direction .",
    "we therefore have to consider eq .",
    "( [ def_k_prec ] ) together with the constraint @xmath319 , with @xmath277 and @xmath90 given by eqns  ( [ def_l2],[def_e ] ) . at horizon",
    "crossing , when @xmath83 one obtains @xmath320 leading to an angular diameter of @xmath321 degrees .",
    "* secondly , soon before hitting the singularity , the same calculaton also gives the surprisingly simple result @xmath322 leading to an angular size of 180  degrees .",
    "in other words , hitting the singularity happens when the black hole silhouette fills exactly half of the celestial sphere , just as what would happen in a euclidean space when one lands on the surface of the spherical body .",
    "* thirdly , the celestial sphere is never very dark before horizon crossing . in order to see this",
    ", one has to consider the scalar product of @xmath323 between the radially freely falling observer and a radial null geodesic .",
    "very simple algebra then show that the maximum redshift that is seen by the observer at the moment he or she crosses the horizon is @xmath3 .",
    "it is only when the observer is deep within the horizon that the maximum redshift significantly increases .",
    "in fact , soon before hitting the singularity , only a very thing ring of direction show a bleshift rather than a redshift , since all what is behind the observer is very dark , being a highly redshifted flux of radiation , and everything that is in front of the observer in absolutely dark , being the black hole silhouette .",
    "in this paper , we have outlined the main steps in order to produce a correct rendering of relativistic raytracing in the schwarzschild metric . although this problem is not new , we have obtained a very satisfactory ( and , to our knowledge , new ) way to simulate correctly the rendering of stars without any significant increase of the cpu time .",
    "this was made possible thanks to the spherically symmetric character of the schwarzschild metric and in fact , such a trick can be easily implemented for any other spherically symmetric metric such as a reissner - nordstrom one , some result of which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "unfortunately , this does not work in a simple way in the kerr metric or any other non spherically symmetric metric such as the papapetrou - majumdar one .",
    "some results regarding these metrics will also be presented elsewhere .",
    "one major drawback of the techniques presented here is that they are still computationally intensive and do not allow real - time rendering of the metric since even at moderate resolutions , the cpu time is of several dozens of seconds .",
    "real - time rendering thus necessitate to reduce cpu time by a factor greater than @xmath165 , which is a rather ambitious goal , the attainability of which will be presented in a future work .",
    "we briefly recall here the different types of null geodesics in the schwarschild metric as well as the parameters that allow to distinguish them .",
    "a null geodesics described by wavevector @xmath142 is characterized by the trivial equation @xmath324 using the constants of motion @xmath90 and @xmath91 defined in eqns  ( [ def_e],[def_l2 ] ) , this can be rewritten @xmath325 where for simplicity @xmath326 denotes the @xmath79 component of the wavevector .",
    "such an equation can formally be seen as decribing the motion of a one dimensional particle along coordinate @xmath79 , with a total energy @xmath327 and subject to a potential @xmath133 given by @xmath328 this potential goes to @xmath160 at infinity and tends to minus infinity when @xmath79 goes to @xmath160 .",
    "it has a unique maximum at @xmath134 ( regardless of the value of @xmath91 ) whose value is @xmath329 .      1 .",
    "if @xmath330 , or , equivalently @xmath331 , then the geodesic does not have any turning points along the @xmath79 coordinate and therefore its endpoints are @xmath57 and @xmath332 .",
    "it originates from infinity if and only if @xmath333 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath334 then the geodesics has its both endpoints either at @xmath57 or at @xmath335 . in the first case",
    ", it always lies within the @xmath336 $ ] region and in the second case it always lies in the @xmath337 region .",
    "the values of @xmath338 and @xmath339 are computed by finding the positive roots of the third degree polynomial equation @xmath340 , the solution of which can be expressed in term of moderately simple elementary functions which do not matter here since if one has @xmath341 ) a geodesic originates from infinity if and only if one lies at @xmath94 .",
    "the critical case @xmath342 corresponds to geodesics which are stuck at @xmath134 or which indefinitely spiral toward this value , either originating from @xmath343 of from @xmath332 . in practice",
    "such geodesics never have to be taken care of since numerical roundoff error prevent from having this exact value of the @xmath344 ratio even if one tries to .",
