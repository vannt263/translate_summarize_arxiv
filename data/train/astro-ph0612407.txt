    "the input value of @xmath2 is stepped along over a given range around zero and @xmath21 is computed at each step .",

    "this is obviously crucial when using the standard method of deriving the 1-@xmath11 uncertainty , @xmath24 , from the width of the @xmath21 curve at @xmath25 : if the fluctuations on the @xmath21 curve are @xmath26@xmath27 then one expects @xmath28 to be rather poorly defined and @xmath24 to be underestimated .",

    "the @xmath21 fluctuations in must therefore be due to failings in the algorithm used to minimize @xmath21 for each input @xmath2 .",
    "this point can not be over - emphasized since the @xmath21 curve is the very means by which measure @xmath2 and its uncertainty in each absorption system .    based on fits to simulated absorption spectra , argue that their measurement technique is indeed robust . however , strong fluctuations even appear in the @xmath21 curves for these simulations ( their figure 2 ) .",
    "this leads to spurious @xmath2 values : figure 6 in shows the results from 30 realizations of a simulated single - component mg / feii absorber .",
    "at least 15 @xmath2 values deviate by @xmath29 from the input value ; 8 of these deviate by @xmath30 and 4 by @xmath31 .",
    "there is even a @xmath32-@xmath11 value .",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 values should be gaussian in this case but these outliers demonstrate that it obviously is not .",
    "the @xmath21 fluctuations also cause the uncertainty estimates , @xmath24 , from each simulation to range over a factor of @xmath33 even though all realizations had the same simulated  and input parameters . none of these problems arise in our own simulations of either single- or multiple - component systems ( @xcite ; )",

    "similarly , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the laboratory and absorber values of @xmath0 .",
    "the mm method is the comparison of measured velocity shifts from several transitions ( with different @xmath37-coefficients ) to compute the best - fitting @xmath2 .",
    "the linear equation ( [ eq : da ] ) implies that the error in @xmath2 is determined only by the distribution of @xmath37-coefficients ( assumed to have negligible errors ) being used and the statistical errors in the velocity shifts , @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 ^ 2\\,.\\ ] ] this expression is just the solution to a straight - line least - squares fit , @xmath48 , to data @xmath49 , with errors only on the @xmath50 , where the intercept @xmath51 is also allowed to vary .",
    "allowing the intercept to vary is important since it mimics the real situation in fitting absorption lines where the absorption redshift and @xmath2 must be determined simultaneously",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : lim1 ] ) can only be used if one knows the statistical error on the velocity shift measurement for each transition , @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity is only well - defined in an absorption system with a single fitted velocity component or in a system with several velocity components which do not blend or overlap significantly with each other .",
    "however , the general case  and , observationally , by far the most common one  is that absorbers have many velocity components which , at the resolution of the spectrograph , are strongly blended together . for this general case",
    "we wish to define a ` total velocity uncertainty ' for each transition _ integrated over the absorption profile _",
    "( i.e.  over all components ) , @xmath52 , so that the substitution @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : lim1 ] ) provides some easily - interpreted information about @xmath54 .    the quantity @xmath52 is commonly used in radial - velocity searches for extra - solar planets , e.g.  @xcite , but is not normally useful in qso absorption - line studies .",
    "most metal - line qso absorption profiles display a complicated velocity structure and one usually focuses on the properties of individual velocity components , each of which is typically modelled by a voigt profile .",

    "some velocity components  typically the narrow , deep - but - unsaturated , isolated ones  will obviously provide stronger constraints than others but all components nevertheless contribute something . thus , @xmath55 should incorporate all the velocity - centroiding information available from a given profile shape . from a spectrum @xmath56 with 1-@xmath11 error array @xmath57 , the minimum possible velocity uncertainty contributed by pixel @xmath58",

    "note that the only requirements are the 1-@xmath11 error spectrum and the multi - component voigt profile fit to the transition s absorption profile .",
    "the latter allows the derivative in ( [ eq : sv_i ] ) to be calculated without the influence of noise . if very high  spectra are available ",
    "i.e.  where the @xmath57 are always much less than the flux difference between neighbouring pixels in high - gradient portions of the absorption profiles  then one could use the spectrum itself instead of the voigt profile fit , thus making the estimate of @xmath62 model - independent .",
    "once @xmath52 has been calculated for all transitions @xmath35 , the uncertainty in @xmath2 simply follows from equation ( [ eq : lim1 ] ) with the substitution @xmath63 .",
    "it is important to realize that the uncertainty calculated with the above method represents the absolute minimum possible 1-@xmath11 error on @xmath2 ; the real error  as derived from a simultaneous @xmath21-minimization of all parameters comprising the voigt profile fits to all transitions  will always be larger than @xmath54 from equation ( [ eq : lim1 ] ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that absorption systems usually have several velocity components which have different optical depths in different transitions .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lim1 ] ) assumes that the velocity information integrated over all components in one transition can be combined with the same integrated quantity from another transition to yield an uncertainty on @xmath2 .",
    "however , in a real determination of @xmath2 , each velocity component ( or group of components which define a sharp spectral feature ) in one transition is , effectively , compared with only the same component ( or group ) in another transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim ] illustrates this important point .",
    "it shows simulated absorption profiles for two transitions commonly used in mm analyses ( mgii @xmath642796 and feii @xmath642600 ) in different stages of saturation .",
    "the velocity structure is identical for both transitions and contains two well - separated main spectral features ( msfs ) , each of which comprises two velocity components which are blended together .",
    "the column - density ratios between the corresponding components of the two transitions is kept fixed while the total column density is varied . for each simulation with a different total column density we determined @xmath54 using the method above and the real value of @xmath24 using the usual @xmath21 minimization analysis . when comparing @xmath65 with @xmath24 one notices 4 characteristic stages as the column density increases :    * * stage 1 : * both msfs are relatively unsaturated in both transitions and",
    "so @xmath52 will be small for @xmath35=mg ii @xmath642796 and @xmath35=feii @xmath642600 .",
    "thus , @xmath54 is quite small .",
    "however , note that the right - hand msf in mgii @xmath642796 is nevertheless a little saturated and so the _ real _ precision is somewhat weakened , i.e.  @xmath24 is pushed higher than @xmath66 ; the high velocity precision available from that msf in feii @xmath642600 is ` wasted ' because the profile of the _ corresponding _ msf in mgii @xmath642796 is smoother . *",
    "* stage 2 : * the right - hand msf in mgii @xmath642796 is now completely saturated . since that part of the profile is now smoother , @xmath54 should get _ larger_. however , this is more than compensated by the additional centroiding potential ( or velocity information ) now offered by the weaker velocity components in the left - hand msf _ and _ both msfs in feii @xmath642600 due to the increased column density . on the other hand , the _ real _ precision , @xmath24 ,",
    "has substantially worsened because the right - hand msf from the two transitions no longer constrain @xmath2 tightly when considered together .",
    "this principle also applies to the left - hand msf where , in feii @xmath642600 , it is too weak to provide strong constraints , even though the same velocity components in mg ii @xmath642796 are stronger and well - defined . *",
    "* stage 3 : * the decrease in @xmath54 is now dominated by the small increase in velocity information available from the left - hand msf because the right - hand msf of both transitions is now saturated .",
    "note also that the _ real _ precision also improves here because the components of the left - hand msf in feii @xmath642600 are getting stronger while the corresponding components of mgii @xmath642796 are not completely saturated .",
    "* * stage 4 : * the decrease in @xmath54 is now only marginal because it is dominated only by one msf in one transition , i.e.  the left - hand side of feii @xmath642600 .",
    "however , @xmath24 has increased sharply because now even the left - hand msf of mgii @xmath642796 is saturated and , when considered together with the corresponding msf of fe ii @xmath642600 , provides no constraint on @xmath2 .    to summarize this illustration ,",
    "it is always the case that @xmath67 and it is the degree of _ differential saturation _ between _ corresponding _ components of different transitions which determines how much worse @xmath24 is than @xmath54 .",
    "also note that the  of the data ( or the simulations above ) affects @xmath54 and @xmath24 in precisely the same way .",
    "that is , the ratio @xmath68 is independent of .",
    "only the degree of differential saturation between corresponding components of different transitions affects @xmath68 .",
    "finally , as the above discussion implies , fits comprising a single velocity component ( or multiple but well separated components ) should have @xmath69 .",
    "as an internal consistency check on our simulations , fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] also shows the results for an absorber with a single velocity component , again in the mgii @xmath642796 and feii @xmath642600 transitions . note that @xmath54 tracks quite closely the real value of @xmath24 as a function of column density",
    "nevertheless , the real error is slightly worse than @xmath65 ; this is expected because the real estimate derives from a fit where all parameters of the absorption profiles , including the doppler parameters and column densities , are varied simultaneously , thus slightly weakening the constraint on @xmath2 ( and the absorber redshift ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath54 for the absorbers from the three independent data - sets which constitute the strongest current constraints on @xmath70 : ( i ) the 143 absorbers in our keck / hires sample ; ( ii ) the 23 absorption systems , comprising mostly mg / feii transitions , from uves studied by ; ( iii ) the uves exposures of the @xmath71 absorber towards he0515@xmath164414 studied by .",
    "calculating @xmath54 requires only the error spectra and the voigt profile models used to fit the data . for samples ( ii ) & ( iii )",
    "we use the voigt profile models published by those authors .",
    "below we describe the errors arrays . for sample ( ii ) ,",
    "other aspects of the data are important for the analysis in section [ sec : rev ] and so we also describe them here .",
    "the reduced ( i.e.  one - dimensional ) spectra in sample ( ii ) were kindly provided to us by b.  aracil who confirmed that the wavelength and flux arrays are identical to those used in . however , one main difference is that the error arrays we use are generally a factor @xmath721.4 smaller than those used by ( h.  chand , b.  aracil , 2006 , private communication ) . we have confirmed this by digitizing the absorption profiles plotted in .",
    "the reason for this is that they derive their error arrays by adding two error terms of similar magnitude in quadrature , even though each term should reasonably approximate the actual error .",
    "one term reflects the formal photon statistics while the other reflects the r.m.s .",
    "variation in the flux from the different exposures which are combined to form the final spectrum .",
    "our error spectra were derived from the maximum of the two terms .",

    "note that this implies that @xmath54 calculated using our spectra will be _ smaller _ than the value would derive .",
    "the only other difference between our spectra and those of is that we performed our own continuum normalization of the absorption profiles .",
    "however , we used a method similar to that employed by and any small differences will have negligible effects on the analysis here and in section [ sec : rev ] for the absorbers involved . ] .    for sample ( iii ) , we reduced the raw uves exposures using a modified version of the uves pipeline . for the present analysis , small differences between our reduction and that of are unimportant ;",
    "all that is required is that the error arrays match fairly closely .",
    "indeed , the  matches very well those quoted by in the relevant portions of the reduced spectrum .    for all samples ,",
    "the atomic data for the transitions ( including @xmath37-coefficients ) were the same as used by the original authors .    in practice , when applying equations ( [ eq : sv_i ] ) and ( [ eq : sv ] ) we sub - divide the absorption profile of each transition into @xmath73 chunks to mitigate the effects illustrated in fig .

    "secondly , for at least 11 of their 23 absorbers , quote errors which are _ smaller _ than @xmath54 . recall that since their error arrays are larger than ours , 11 out of 23 is a conservative estimate ; if they were to calculate @xmath54 using their larger error arrays then more points on fig .",

    "finally , the very small error quoted by for he0515@xmath164414 , @xmath79 , disagrees significantly with the limiting precision of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the ( supposedly ) strong current uves constraints on @xmath2 fail a basic consistency test which not only challenges the precision reported by and but which must bring into question the robustness and validity of their analysis and final @xmath2 values .    as discussed in section [ ssec : chi ] , underestimated error bars on @xmath2 are expected from the jagged @xmath21 curves derived by .",

    "the atomic data for the different transitions ( i.e.  laboratory wavelengths , oscillator strengths etc . ) were identical to those used by .",

    "the first effect is easy to understand : the minimum @xmath21 must , by definition , be found in a downward extreme fluctuation . since the fluctuations are @xmath261 , the width of the ` curve ' at @xmath91 will be underestimated , typically by factors of order a few . the absorber at @xmath92 towards q0122@xmath16380 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi](left ) , is the extreme example of this problem .",
    "the @xmath21 fluctuations are @xmath310 here , leading to assign an uncertainty of just @xmath93 for this system .",
    "note that different points on their @xmath21 curve are separated by this value so , even in principle , such an error estimate is questionable .",
    "our robust error estimate is almost a factor of 16 times larger .",
    "also note that it is far from clear how determine @xmath24 in some absorbers .",
    "one such case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi](right ) where , following the previous example , @xmath2 would appear to be @xmath94 rather than the value quoted by , @xmath95 .",
    "in a few absorbers , such as this one , the confusion inherent in deriving @xmath24 from such jagged @xmath21 curves may have somewhat ameliorated potentially gross underestimates ; in others , not .     uncertainties from our analysis ( grey / red bars ) compared with those of @xcite ( black bars ) .",
    "the tight distribution of @xmath2 values from @xcite has a probability of just @xmath96 of occurring by chance given our new robust error estimates . ]    the second effect  that the @xmath2 values of are biased towards zero  is more difficult to understand .",
    "first , to demonstrate that the effect is significant , fig .",
    "[ fig : cmp ] shows the values of @xmath2 from plotted with the 1-@xmath11 uncertainties from our analysis .",
    "the @xmath2 values are clearly more tightly clustered around zero than expected based on our robust error - bars : the value of @xmath21 around the weighted mean of @xmath97 is just @xmath98 . for 22 degrees of freedom ,",
    "a @xmath21 this low ( or lower ) _ has a probability of only @xmath96 of occurring by chance alone_. the explanation for such a strong bias _ may _ be linked , again , to the failure of the @xmath21 minimization algorithm of .",
    "one possibility is that , for a given absorber , the minimization algorithm may have been run several times with @xmath2 fixed to zero with very slightly different initial conditions ( as one might do when experimenting with different velocity structures in the model fit ) , thus reducing @xmath21 to a relatively low value even though the algorithm was impaired . when subsequently using non - zero values of @xmath2 in individual minimizations , the perturbation which the small shift in @xmath0 imparts to the fit could cause @xmath21 to preferentially fluctuate to higher values .",
    "the impaired minimization algorithm may or may not repair this fluctuation ( i.e.  reduce @xmath21 by adjusting the parameters of the fit ) ; this ` hysteresis ' would therefore bias @xmath2 towards zero .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] demonstrates the robustness of our @xmath2 and @xmath24 estimates , the large scatter of the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] is inconsistent with our previous hires results .",
    "furthermore , the hires values had a scatter consistent with that expected from the @xmath24 estimates ( e.g.  @xcite ; ) .",
    "what systematic effects might contribute to the additional scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ?    we considered a wide variety of systematic effects on @xmath2 in @xcite and , the most obvious possibility being wavelength calibration errors",
    ". the quasar spectra are wavelength calibrated by comparison with exposures of a thorium - argon ( thar ) emission - line lamp .",
    "a simple test for miscalibration effects was described in @xcite and applied to the hires data in @xcite and : the basic approach was to treat the thar emission lines near the redshifted quasar absorption lines to the same mm analysis , thereby deriving a correction , @xmath99 , to the value of @xmath2 in each absorber .",
    "for the hires spectra , wavelength calibration errors contributed negligible corrections , especially since so many absorption systems ( 128 ) were used .",
    "this thar test was not applied to the results of .",
    "however , recently in @xcite we found that corruptions of the input list of thar wavelengths caused significant distortions of the wavelength scale in uves spectra such as those of . from these distortions it is possible to quantify the value of @xmath99 and it was demonstrated in @xcite that the absorber at @xmath100 towards q0122@xmath16380 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : chi](left ) ] was , again , particularly problematic , having @xmath101 .",
    "this is 4 times larger than the formal uncertainty quoted by for this system .",
    "however , for most absorbers the corrections due to wavelength calibration errors are small compared to the scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ; other systematic errors must dominate .",
    "another strong possibility is that too few velocity components have been fitted to the absorption profiles in many of the 23 absorbers .",
    "if this is the case then one should expect to find values of @xmath84 for the profile fits exceeding @xmath721 , whereas generally found @xmath102 for their fits .",
    "however , as mentioned several times above , the error spectra employed by were set too high by a factor of @xmath721.32 .",
    "this is easily cross - checked by comparing the r.m.s .",
    "flux in continuum regions around the absorption profiles with the 1-@xmath11 error spectra .",
    "thus , when more appropriate error arrays are employed , as in our new analysis , the velocity structures of prove too simplistic , resulting in the high values of @xmath1034 we derive .",
    "clearly  and , in many cases , this is obvious simply upon visual inspection  more velocity components must be fitted in almost all 23 absorption systems to account for the evident velocity structure that the high @xmath84 values reflect .",
    "preliminary fits which include additional velocity components indicate that ` under - fitting ' of the absorption profiles has indeed caused large , spurious excursions in @xmath2 and may well be responsible for the bulk of the scatter in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] .",
    "the following section presents a discussion and simulations of complicated velocity structures which confirm this .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , several other recent studies of uves qso spectra have ostensibly provided constraints on @xmath2 . the first of these was the ad analysis of 15 siiv doublets by @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath21 curves they present contain strong fluctuations just like those in ",
    "see their figures 16 .",
    "it is therefore with caution that their final weighted mean result of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) should be interpreted .",
    "our analysis of a sample of 21 somewhat lower  siiv absorbers from keck / hires gave @xmath104 over the range @xmath105 without similar problems in minimizing @xmath21 for each absorber @xcite .",
    "in section [ sssec : apply ] we saw that the mm analysis of the single complex @xmath15 absorber towards he0515@xmath164414 by gave a very small uncertainty of @xmath106 but that the limiting precision was substantially larger , @xmath107 .",
    "however , in this case , we can not easily identify the cause of the inconsistency .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite possible , even likely , that the cause of the underestimated uncertainty also affected the value of @xmath2 and , again , caution should evidently be used in interpreting the result of .",
    "previous analyses of the same absorber by the same group utilized very simplistic profile fits : see figure 2 of @xcite , particularly at velocities around @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111@xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 where large residuals are clearly visible . as we demonstrate below , these are very likely to have caused large systematic effects in this single - absorber estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "the same single absorber was studied , again with mm analysis , by @xcite . however , in this case the fluctuations on the @xmath21 curve were so large ",
    "@xmath350 ; see their figure 9  that the authors found it difficult to define a minimum in the curve .",
    "instead they attempted to fit a low - order polynomial through the large fluctuations  as one would fit a line through noisy data  to define a minimum .",
    "it must be strongly emphasized that such a practice is illogical and yields completely meaningless values of @xmath2 and @xmath24 .",
    "firstly , it is not ` noise ' in the usual sense that one is attempting to fit through but spurious fluctuations in @xmath21 caused by the failure of the algorithm to find the true minimum at each fixed input value of @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , the _ real _ @xmath21 curve must lie _ beneath _ the majority of points on the @xmath21 and it _ can not _ lie above any of them .",
    "the logical conclusion is that one can not infer the shape , minimum or width ",
    "i.e.  @xmath2 or @xmath24  from such a @xmath21 curve since the real @xmath21 curve may lie anywhere below it .",
    "the most recent constraint on @xmath2 from uves qso spectra was derived from mm analysis of the @xmath18 absorber towards q1101@xmath16264 by : @xmath115 .",
    "three feii transitions were employed ",
    "@xmath641608 , @xmath642382 and @xmath642600 .",
    "the latter two have nearly identical @xmath37-coefficients so they shift in concert as @xmath0 varies .",
    "however , the bluer line , @xmath641608 , shifts in the opposite sense to the other two and is therefore crucial for any meaningful constraint on @xmath2 to be derived .",
    "it is also the weaker line of the trio , with an oscillator strength less than a third of the others .",
    "as outlined in section [ ssec : sys ] , systematic effects , even with small statistical samples of absorbers , can result if one does not fit the observed structure in the absorption profiles with an adequate number of velocity components . for any analysis of a _ single _ absorber",
    ", this becomes particularly important .",
    "explored this effect by using three different fits : a fiducial one with 16 velocity components and two others with _ fewer _ ( 11 and 10 ) components .",
    "they find very similar values of @xmath2 from all fits and therefore maintain that @xmath2 is insensitive to the number of fitted components .",
    "however , the components removed from the fiducial fit to form the 11- and 10-component fits appear mainly at the edges of the absorption complex and , crucially , do not absorb statistically significant fractions of the continuum in the weaker feii @xmath641608 transition .",
    "that is , those components do not appear in feii @xmath641608 . since this transition is vital to provide any sensitivity to @xmath0 at all , one _ must _ find similar values of @xmath2 in all three fits ; as far as @xmath2 is concerned , the three fits are identical and the test , in this case , is ineffective",
    ". in any case , visual inspection of the residuals between the fiducial fit and the data reveals correlations over @xmath320-pixel ranges and , moreover , these ranges occur at similar velocities in the three different transitions .",
    "this is one indication of _ more _ than 16 components being required in the fit , not fewer .",
    "we will present further analysis of this absorber in bainbridge et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    to illustrate the effect of ` under - fitting ' absorbers in this way , fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] shows a simulated absorption spectrum generated with 6 velocity components but which has then been fitted with different numbers of components .",
    "the mgii doublet ( @xmath1162796/2803 ) and the five strongest feii transitions longward of 2340  were included in the fit but fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] just shows two representative transitions .",
    "all transitions were simulated with a  of 200 per 2.5-  pixel in the continuum .",
    "the velocity structure was inspired by ( but is not strictly the same as ) a real absorption system  one of the 23 contained in the sample  and includes two weaker components ( the second and fourth from the left ) .",
    "it is these components which are missing in our 4- and 5-component fits to the simulated data .",
    "these fits result in values of @xmath2 which deviate significantly from the input value depending on which component is removed .",
    "thus , ` under - fitting ' individual absorption systems can easily cause spurious values of @xmath2 .    with such high  ` data ' we can also ` over - fit ' the simulated absorption system .",
    "the additional components were placed at around @xmath117 and @xmath118@xmath119 . of course , @xmath84 for these fits is below unity and , more importantly , the additional components are not statistically justified : the reduction in @xmath21 they provide compared to the fiducial 6-component fit is smaller than the additional number of free parameters they introduce .",
    "nevertheless , the results show that the value of @xmath2 is robust to the introduction of these components .",
    "we hasten to add that one can not simply keep fitting additional components : note that the uncertainty on @xmath2 increases as one adds components  with more components , @xmath21 becomes increasingly insensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "however , when reporting strong constraints on @xmath2 from _ individual _ absorbers , some demonstration of how robust @xmath2 is to both under- and over - fitting is desirable and our illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] suggests that the latter is more conservative than the former .",
    "we have critically analysed the reliability of the mm treatment of 23 vlt / uves absorption systems by @xcite . using the _ same data and profile fits _ we find values of @xmath2 in individual absorbers which deviate significantly from those of and our uncertainty estimates are consistently and , in some cases dramatically , larger .",
    "indeed , simple ( but robust ) calculations of the limiting precision available on @xmath2 in these absorbers indicates that @xmath26half of s quoted uncertainties are impossibly low ; the  of the spectra and the complexity of the fitted velocity structures simply do not allow such small uncertainties on @xmath2 .",
    "this is altogether unsurprising given the large fluctuations in the @xmath21 curves presented by .",
    "the only way such large fluctuations can occur is if the @xmath21 minimization algorithm fails to reach a truly minimum value at each step along the input @xmath2 axis .",
    "that is , since the very means by which @xmath2 is estimated ( the @xmath21 curve ) is flawed , so are the values of @xmath2 and their uncertainties invalid .",
    "just as the 1-@xmath11 errors were underestimated , we have also demonstrated that s values of @xmath2 are strongly biased towards zero .",
    "again , this is likely to stem from the fluctuations on the @xmath21 curves .",
    "it is therefore expected that s weighted mean result of @xmath1 should not truly represent the _ reduced data and profile fits _ they employed .",
    "indeed , our own analysis  again , with the same reduced data and profile fits  yields a very different central value and much a larger error bar : @xmath4 . since our @xmath21 minimization is demonstrably robust , we argue that this latter value does truly reflect the reduced data and profile fits .",
    "however , we do not argue that this value is necessarily the final or best one to be gleaned from this dataset : improvements in the profile fits are almost certainly required to reduce the evident scatter in the 23 values of @xmath2 to within that expected based on their ( robust ) 1-@xmath11 uncertainties . although not discussed in this paper , improvements in the data reduction process may also be needed . after increasing the uncertainties by adding a constant amount in quadrature to match the scatter , we obtain a more conservative estimate of the weighted mean from s reduced data and profile fits : @xmath5 .",
    "note that the uncertainty here is 6 times larger than that quoted by .",
    "the data and fits of thus provide no stringent test of the keck / hires evidence for a varying @xmath0 .",
    "jagged @xmath21 curves have also affected the ad analysis of si iv doublets in uves spectra by @xcite and the mm analysis of a single , high-  uves spectrum by @xcite .",
    "the same single absorber was studied by @xcite but their quoted uncertainty is much lower than the limiting precision available , even in principle , from this spectrum .",
    "the only other uves constraint on @xmath2 is from another single absorption system studied by @xcite .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that when analysing individual systems in this way , care must be taken to ensure that all the structure in the absorption profiles is adequately fitted .",
    "indeed , simulations indicate ` under - fitting ' the profile can cause dramatic spurious excursions from the real value of @xmath2 whereas ` over - fitting ' the profile ( to a mild degree ) is a more conservative approach .",
    "we argue that additional components are probably required to fit the data of ; this will be demonstrated in bainbridge et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    in summary , reliable comparison of hires and uves constraints on a varying @xmath0 must await improvements in the analysis of uves spectra .",
