    "velocity distributions in dilute granular gases are generically away from equilibrium because the collision processes in such gases are dissipative . even in the dilute limit the velocities of different particles",
    "may be strongly correlated  @xcite , and therefore the usual description in terms of single particle distribution functions may not be sufficient to determine all the properties of the granular gas .",
    "nevertheless , the single particle distribution @xmath1 contains important information , and is particularly interesting because in a granular gas it typically deviates from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution . quite aside from possible spatial inhomogeneity effects such as particle clustering , even the single particle velocity distribution @xmath2 in general differs from the maxwell - boltzmann form .",
    "the deviations of these single particle distributions from the usual `` universal '' behavior in ordinary gases has been a subject of intense interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "these deviations can be observed in granular gases that achieve a steady state because external forcing balances the dissipative collisions among particles  @xcite , or they can be observed in unforced gases as they cool down  @xcite .    typically , gases equilibrate or achieve a steady state via collision processes .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum imply maxwellian velocity statistics in three dimensions  @xcite . in lower dimensions",
    "the situation is more complicated ; for example , a gas of hard spheres in one dimension simply retains its initial distribution forever . in granular media",
    "the situation is in any case more complex because energy is certainly not conserved  @xcite .",
    "most work on relaxation in granular materials , in any dimension , has focused on the interesting consequences of energy non - conservation .",
    "a particularly interesting behavior of granular gases induced by energy non - conservation is the so - called `` inelastic collapse , '' whereby the energy of the gas goes to zero in a finite time  @xcite . in the `` quasi - elastic limit '' the inelastic collapse",
    "is avoided , and one obtains non - trivial asymptotic velocity distributions  @xcite with features similar to the ones obtained in this paper .    in the presence of friction , not only is energy",
    "not conserved , but momentum is not conserved either , leading to interesting new relaxation behavior  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have recently shown  @xcite that in the absence of conservation laws random linear mixing can lead to velocity distributions with algebraic or exponential tails , with nontrivial characteristic exponents . in general , conservation laws play a crucial role in the universality of the usual velocity distribution properties .",
    "our focus here is the effect of viscosity , and consequently , of momentum non - conservation , on the velocity distribution as a one - dimensional dilute granular gas cools down .",
    "the model consists of @xmath3 grains on a line ( or a circle , since we will use periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the grains move freely except during collisions , governed by the hertz potential , @xmath4 here @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the displacement of granule @xmath7 from its equilibrium position , and @xmath8 is a prefactor determined by young s modulus and poisson s ratio .",
    "the exponent @xmath9 is @xmath10 for spheres , it is @xmath11 for cylinders , and in general depends on geometry . in this paper",
    "we only consider cylindrical grains , which leads to considerable simplification while still capturing important general features of the non - maxwellian distributions .",
    "we stress that the one - sided ( only repulsion ) granular potential even with @xmath12 is entirely different from a two - sided ( repulsion and attraction ) harmonic potential .",
    "the displacement of the @xmath7-th granule ( @xmath13 ) of mass @xmath14 in the chain from its equilibrium position in a frictional medium is governed by the equation of motion @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the friction coefficient and @xmath17 is the heaviside function , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the heaviside function ensures that two particles interact only when in contact , that is , only when the particles are loaded .",
    "note that for periodic boundary conditions @xmath23 . in terms of the rescaled variables and parameters @xmath24 where @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath26 a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity @xmath28 is an arbitrary choice in terms of which other velocities are now expressed , i.e. , it settles the energy scale of the system .",
    "although the problem might appear relatively simple because it is one - dimensional and quasi - linear , the one - sidedness of the potential leads to analytic complexities even in the dissipationless case  @xcite , and even greater complexities in the presence of dissipation  @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to explore analytic approximations appropriate for _ low densities_. the low density feature of these approximations is implemented via the assumption that the collisions are always _ binary _ , that is , that only two granules at a time are members of any collision event , and that at any moment of time there is at most one collision .",
    "we explore two low - density analytic approximations .",
    "one is based on the boltzmann equation for binary collisions , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : defs ] and elaborated in sec .",
    "[ sec : boltzmann ] , and the other is an even simpler model that we call the maxwell model , presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : maxwell ] . the detailed description of a binary collision that must be used as an input in either of these models is also presented in sec .  [ sec : defs ] .",
    "to assess the success of each analytic model , a comparison of the approximate model results with numerical simulations of the entire chain is carried out in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] . in that section",
    "we also summarize the outcome of our analysis .",
    "our analytic starting point in the following sections is the boltzmann equation for binary collisions in a spatially uniform gas , which describes the rate of change of the probability distribution of velocities , @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the initial velocities of a pair of particles just before a collision and and @xmath31 and @xmath32 their velocities just after , then the boltzmann equation is @xmath33 .",
    "\\label{beq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the problem is one - dimensional , one can keep track of the precise conditions under which a collision between two particles of given velocities will or will not occur , and how these events will change the distribution function .",
    "the binary collision approximation implies that at any one time there is at most one pair of loaded grains , so we need to consider in detail the fate of a colliding pair from the beginning to the end of a collision  @xcite . at the moment of the start of the collision , which we call @xmath34 , the velocities of the grains are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the collision ends at the time @xmath35 , when the grains lose contact .",
    "it is important to notice that for @xmath36 the collision time _ is independent _ of the initial condition .",
    "this is a feature that makes the cylindrical granule geometry much simpler than other shapes . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath37 , since we can always relabel particles to make it so .",
    "the velocities at the moment of separation @xmath38 are found to be  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 .    in our further analysis",
    "we think of the distance traveled by the granules during a collision as negligible . for small damping @xmath41",
    "this distance is @xmath42 , which is to be compared to the mean distance between particles .",
    "the latter can be made arbitrarily large by lowering the density .",
    "we also take the collision time between two granules as instantaneous .",
    "this collision time for small damping is @xmath43 , to be compared with the typical mean free time of flight of a particle between collisions . with these approximations , the only role played by the viscosity is dictated by the collision rule  ( [ eq : vel ] ) .",
    "these assumptions might conceivably be problematic for the most energetic particles that may travel a relatively long distance during a collision and a relatively short distance between collisions , but explicit analysis of these extreme events is difficult and probably not important at sufficiently low densities .",
    "we now start with the boltzmann equation ( [ beq ] ) in which the collision rate depends on the difference in the velocities of the colliding pair . to write the explicit boltzmann equation for our system , we must collect all the instances that lead to a collision , that is , all the instances for which one or another of the @xmath44-functions in eq .",
