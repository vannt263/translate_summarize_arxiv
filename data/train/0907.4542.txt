    "one of the goals of the physics program at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) is to locate a critical point in the qcd phase diagram @xcite . the qcd phase diagram is often plotted as temperature ( @xmath1 ) _ vs. _ baryon chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) calculations indicate that at small chemical potential ( @xmath2@xmath30 ) , corresponding to the cases for rhic and lhc , the transition from hadronic to partonic matter is a cross - over @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , model calculations suggest that when the @xmath2 is larger , the transition becomes first order in nature @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects the existence of a critical point at the end of first order transition @xcite . at rhic",
    "we plan to scan @xcite the center of mass energy ( @xmath0 ) to vary @xmath2 in order to search for the location of the qcd critical point .",
    "several lattice calculations suggest the existence of the critical point for @xmath4 @xmath5  160 mev @xcite , corresponding to a center of mass energy of @xmath6  gev .",
    "one of the characteristic signatures of the critical point is an increase in fluctuations of various event - by - event observables  @xcite .",
    "the moments of the conserved quantities such as net - charge , net - baryon and net strangeness are related to respective thermodynamic quantity susceptibilities .",
    "the lgt calculations , indeed , have shown that the fourth moment of these distributions have large values or diverge at critical temperature near the qcd critical point  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that higher moments of event - by - event net - charge and net - proton multiplicities are significantly more sensitive to existence of critical point compared to measures based on second moments  @xcite .",
    "the fourth moments of these multiplicity distributions are expected to be proportional to the seventh power of the correlation length  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the evolution of fluctuations from the critical point to the freeze - out may lead to non - gaussianity in the event - by - event multiplicity distributions .",
    "thus , the kurtosis of multiplicity distributions ( net - charge or net - proton ) could be a sensitive observable in the search of qcd critical point .",
    "we present the results of the moments of net - charge and net - proton distributions at midrapidity from au+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath0 = 200  gev in the star experiment at rhic .",
    "with the large acceptance and excellent particle identification capabilities , star provides the best environment for studying event by event fluctuations .",
    "the charged particles were detected in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and protons were identified by their specific energy loss in the tpc gas .",
    "standard star track quality cuts were applied in this analysis .",
    "the charged particle tracks are chosen to be within the transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) range of @xmath8  gev / c whereas for protons the @xmath7 range is taken to be @xmath9 gev / c in order to have a clean proton identification and to reject secondary protons from interactions with detector material .",

[ fig1 ] . for the charged particles the distributions are symmetric around the mean value",
    "whereas the distributions for net - protons seem to be skewed in peripheral collisions .",

    "the characterization of a given data set may be obtained by analyzing the moments of their distribution . for a given distribution of @xmath20 data points ,",
    "the third and fourth moments are expressed in terms of skewness and kurtosis as given by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the standard deviation .",
    "skewness is a measure of the symmetry of a distribution whereas kurtosis measures the peakedness of the distribution . for a gaussian distribution ,",
    "the values of skewness and kurtosis are zero .",
    "a positive value of skewness means a long tail on the right side and a negative value means the left tail is dominant .",

    "@xmath25 eliminates the 1/n behaviour necessary for the central limit theorem and removes explicit dependence on centrality .",

    "the results are presented as a function of collision centrality for mid - rapidity and low @xmath27 ranges . in case of net - charge distributions , the skewness values are close to zero for all centralities indicating the distributions are rather symmetric around the mean and the @xmath25 distributions are consistent with the predictions from hijing . for net - protons , the kurtosis distributions",
    "are observed to decrease with increasing collision centrality and the @xmath25 is unity for all centrality bins .",
    "the values are in agreement with model calculations from hijing which do not have the physics of qcd critical point .",

    "the present study at the currently available rhic energies only probes the @xmath4 @xmath16 30 mev region of the phase diagram , while most theoretical calculations expect the qcd critical point to exist around @xmath28160  mev .",
