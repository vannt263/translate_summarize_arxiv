    "the spatial atomic distribution can be measured by taking an absorption image either immediately afterwards ( position analysis ) or alternatively after a free expansion time of typically @xmath3 ( momentum analysis ) .",
    "the zeeman state of atoms can be analysed by either applying a stern - gerlach force with a magnetic field gradient , which allows one to spatially resolve atoms in the different zeeman states in a far field time - of - flight measurement , or by using a zeeman state - selective microwave @xmath4-pulse which transfers the atoms from the @xmath5 to the @xmath6 hyperfine state and subsequently recording a shadow image on a ccd - camera with a laser beam pulse tuned to the @xmath7 hyperfine component of the rubidium d2-line .",

    "the eigenstates of these two bands can now be expressed in terms of the eigenstates @xmath42 and @xmath44 of the free atom . when diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) assuming a finite size energy gap @xmath45 one readily finds    @xmath46    one way to selectively load atoms into the upper ( @xmath47 ) or lower ( @xmath48 ) eigenstate is to initially load the atoms into one band far from the crossing , where the mixing angle between the two bands is small and selective loading can be achieved",

    "subsequently , the atomic population can be transferred adiabatically , e.g. by corresponding slow acceleration of the lattice , into the region of the crossing ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this section ,",
    "we describe a method to diabatically load into the eigenstates of the lattice by transferring atoms initially in the ground band to a desired upper band near a crossing by simultaneously imparting two bragg pulses to the atoms , each of which resonantly couple ground band atoms ( in state @xmath49 ) to the eigenstates @xmath42 and @xmath44 respectively . for equal pulse areas of both pulses and a relative phase @xmath50 of the two bragg pulses ,",

    "the observed relative population of the @xmath58 states shows a sinusoidal dependence on the phase @xmath50 , as expected .",
    "the observed finite contrast of the sinusoidal variation is attributed to remaining coupling to other bands , the finite initial momentum width of the atomic sample , and the limited rabi frequencies of the bragg pulses .    in a further experiment",
    ", we have included an additional , variable holding time before accelerating away from the band crossing and performing time - of - flight imaging for detection to verify whether the two superimposed bragg pulses leave the atoms in an eigenstate of the system .",

    "the relative population of the bloch states remains constant , as expected for an eigenstate . for longer holding times , we observe atom loss attributed to spontaneous scattering from the lattice beams , which prohibits further detailed investigations .",
    "non - relativistic quantum tunneling corresponds to the effect that a particle is able to penetrate a potential barrier which is not surmountable in the classical case with an exponential loss of the probability amplitude . for relativistic particles , on the other hand ,",
    "also penetration of a barrier without this exponential damping is possible .",
    "this effect , as predicted by klein @xcite , occurs when a strong potential , being repulsive for particles and attractive for antiparticles , results in particle and antiparticle states matching in energy across the barrier .",

    "we can both investigate the case of an effectively relativistic dispersion near the position of the crossing between the first and the second excited bloch band , for the case of a vanishing or small splitting between bands , or the case of a quadratic dispersion with atoms not being able to tunnel between bands for the case of a large splitting between bands , ( see also fig .",
