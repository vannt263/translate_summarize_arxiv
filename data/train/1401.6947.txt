    "the flux variations caused by magnetic activity can hamper the extraction of the exoplanet atmosphere signal and a need arises to diagnose stellar variability mostly in the near - ir and mid - ir continuum .",
    "such variations are associated with active regions ( cool and/or bright spots ) coming on and off view as the star rotates and from intrinsic variability of such active regions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the impact of activity varies with wavelength and , during transmission spectroscopy , it may be confused as a planetary atmosphere effect @xcite .",
    "these variations can occur on relatively many timescales compared to the planet s orbital period , and thus impact directly on echo s observation strategy , which will consist in the combination of different epochs of eclipse data @xcite .",
    "the problem of magnetic activity is a main issue in particular for m dwarfs , which may be largely covered by photospheric cool spots @xcite . in the recent years",
    "some work has been done using optical spectra , but focusing on the chromospheric indicators ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while there is poor knowledge on the infrared , mostly due to lack of data . moreover , if the star hosts hot jupiters , then planetary atmospheres may be as hot as photospheric spots , thus affecting the same spectral ranges .",
    "we can assume that the transiting planetary atmosphere is almost transparent in the optical , its opacity showing molecular features at wavelengths longer than 2.5@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "one possible approach is thus to obtain simultaneous optical and infrared spectra , using the former as a calibrator to correct the effects of activity .",
    "observations in the visible range are thus essential to provide the stellar data needed for the measurement and interpretation of exoplanet atmospheres .",
    "echo will adopt such approach .    from the theoretical point of view , synthetic models of dm spectra still present some inconsistencies compared to the observations , due to the difficulties in implementing realistic molecular opacities , grain formation and convection in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "finally , may theoretical models perfectly reproduce the observed spectra , the robustness of the method described in @xcite decreases with later spectral types .    to overcome all these difficulties , in this paper we discuss a new mixed observation - model approach for the analysis and correction of the effects of magnetic activity in dm spectra . in particular , in sect .",
    "[ sec : coaddition ] we build an empirical library of quiet m spectra using the database of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , while in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we discuss the results of our spectral fitting algorithm .",
    "we take advantage of the catalog of 70,841 m spectra selected by @xcite from the sdss .",
    "these spectra , which are flux - calibrated by the sdss pipeline , cover the wavelength range from @xmath13800  to @xmath19000  with a spectral resolution of r@xmath12000 .",
    "@xcite also provide a number of measurements relative to the spectra ( e.g.  radial velocity , interstellar extinction , metallicity index , h@xmath2 equivalent width  ) , which we use to discard outliers and/or peculiar stars .",
    "we use these measurements to select good representatives of quiet m stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we will carefully describe this selection in a forthcoming paper dedicated to the study of activity in low mass stars . here",
    "we remark that our first selection includes bona - fine disk stars with solar - like metallicity and poor interstellar extinction.then , for each subtype we select 25% of the spectra with the lowest emission in h@xmath3 , which are likely the quietest spectra in the selected subsamples .",
    "finally , for each subsample we keep 66% of the spectra with the highest s / n .",

    "cols=\"^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     after correction for doppler effect , we degrade the spectra down to echo s nominal spectral resolution ( r=300 ) , propagating the sdss flux uncertainties accordingly . then , we scale the spectra ( both fluxes and corresponding uncertainties ) such that the integrated flux over the 5500@xmath49000    range matches the flux of the synthetic spectrum computed by @xcite with the same temperature .",
    "we adopt the temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "once the spectra are justified in wavelength and luminosity , for each spectral subtype we compute the sigma - clipped average weighted over the flux uncertainties , obtaining our quiet templates .",
    "these are extended over the infrared range ( up to @xmath5=20@xmath0 m ) using the synthetic spectra of @xcite with the same temperature .",
    "our spectral templates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrae ] .",
    "in this section we describe our algorithm to correct the distortion in m dwarfs spectra introduced by photospheric active regions using the spectral templates derived in sect .  [",
    "sec : coaddition ] .",
    "the proposed approach is based on the following assumptions @xcite :    * photospheric activity is due to the presence of a dominant spot cooler than the photosphere , i.e.  @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , covering a fraction @xmath9  of the stellar surface ( @xmath8  is the temperature of the unspotted photosphere , @xmath6  and @xmath9  are the spot s temperature and filling factor respectively ) ; * the observed flux @xmath10 can be expressed as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and the @xmath13 are the fluxes radiated by the unspotted photosphere and the spot respectively . * the spectrum radiated by a m star is largely determined by its photospheric temperature , while the presence of active regions on the stellar surface introduces a first order distortion in the spectrum .",
    "we thus assume that spectral typing is weakly affected by photospheric activity .",
    "we use our spectral templates to model the flux @xmath12 from the unperturbed photosphere , at temperature @xmath8 , and the flux @xmath13 radiated by the spot , at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "we extend our analysis down to the m7 spectral type , due to the fact that the m8 and m9 templates descend from statistically poor samples ( @xmath1425 spectra , table  [ tab : samples ] ) and , by consequence , are quite uncertain , with s / n@xmath1200 over the analyzed spectral range .",
    "we focus on the 5500  @xmath49000    spectral range , entirely covered by the sdss spectra : the blue cutoff is presumably the bluest wavelength observable with echo , while the red cutoff is a compromise between the need to have a band broad enough to include the spectral features sensitive to activity , and maintain as small as possible the overlap with the band interesting  for planetary atmosphere observations . in this spectral range",
    "we exclude a few narrow windows bracketing the chromospheric lines , i.e.  the nai doublet ( not resolved at echo s resolution , at @xmath15893   ) , the h@xmath3 line ( @xmath56562.79 ) , the caii irt ( @xmath58498.02 , @xmath58542.09 , @xmath58662.14 ) , the caoh band head at @xmath16225    @xcite .    since we foresee the application of this method also for stars with no information on the distance , in the following analysis we will normalize the spectra over the integrated spectra in the analyzed spectral range ( 5500  @xmath49000    excluding the small gaps discussed above ) .",
    "we analyze the effect of activity separately for each subtype .",
    "we fix the subtype , and we build a 2d grid of spotted spectra in the @xmath9@xmath15@xmath16  space , where @xmath16=@xmath8-@xmath6 . in this space , @xmath9  ranges in the [ 0,0.5 ] interval with a step of 0.01 , while @xmath16  runs from 50  k up to the temperature difference corresponding to a m7 spot , with a step of 20  k. for each node in the grid , we compute the corresponding spotted spectrum using eq .",
    "[ eq : flux ] . this grid is thus a bidimensional collection of reference spectra for the following fitting procedure .",
    "then , we simulate a number of spotted spectra with different combinations of @xmath9  and @xmath16  ( not corresponding to any of the grid nodes ) , over which we run our fitting algorithm aimed at recovering the simulated parameters .",
    "we also simulate the noise associated with the observed spectra using the transmissivity function delivered by echo s consortium ( adriani , _ private communication _",
    "[ fig : efficiency ] ) , available up to 2.5  @xmath17 m .",
    "in particular , the noise we simulate is such to have s / n@xmath18=200 per resolution element , which is the minimum requirement for the echo mission .        in order to recover the simulated parameters",
    ", we fit the observed spectrum using the nelder - meade ( or downhill simplex ) method , which minimizes the weighted @xmath19 over the @xmath16  and @xmath9  ranges covered by the 2d grid .",
    "the minimization method is such that the solution is searched over the continuous parameter intervals , i.e.  it is not constrained on the grid nodes ( as for the nearest neighbor method ) .      to test the robustness of our algorithm",
    ", we generate 1000 random realizations of flux noise to associate to the simulated spectrum , and we run the fitting algorithm on each noisy spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit ] we show the output of our algorithm for the test case of a m0 star with a spot @xmath16=325  k cooler than the photosphere and with @xmath9=0.10 .",
    "the mode of the 2d probability distribution function of the 1000 best - fits ( left panel ) is consistent with the simulated parameters within 1 sigma .",
    "in particular , we remark that the geometry of the confidence region is such that the the output parameters are anti - correlated , i.e.  the spot s temperature decreases with increasing coverage .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the impact of the spot in the observed fluxes increases with both parameters .",
    "we also remark that the half - width of the @xmath20  range spanned by the confidence region is as large as @xmath21100  k.        in fig .",
    "[ fig : bestfit ] we also plot the distortion introduced in the spectrum by the spot , compared with the simulated s / n .",
    "the black solid line represents the error one makes when subtracting the quiet template to the observed spectrum .",
    "this residual spectrum contains structures above the noise level which significantly affect the planetary signal .",
    "if we correct the observed spectrum using the best - fit parameters , the structures in the residual spectrum ( green line ) are largely reduced below noise . moreover , the envelope of the solution within the 68% confidence region ( red dashed lines , see left panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : bestfit ] ) are consistent with the noise level , indicating that the algorithm introduces negligible uncertainty compared with flux noise .",
    "we tested a number of cases with different spectral types and spot s parameters , obtaining results similar to what is discussed above . to determine the applicability limits of our procedure",
    ", we also tested the some challenging test cases .",

    "we find that the 1-@xmath22 2d region ( left panel ) spans larger ranges of @xmath9  and @xmath6 , including in particular consistent overestimates of the two parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that , since the spectral distortion is comparable with noise , the best fit sometimes collapses to the edge of the investigated parameter space , leading to solutions which overcorrect the observed spectrum above the noise level ( right panel ) .",
    "we find that this is a regular feature for the cases with spectral distortion comparable with noise , due to the fact that the best fit solution tend to collapse at the edge of the investigated parameter space .",
    "we are currently working on a way to discriminate and automatically avoid such cases .",
    "still , the algorithm is able to confidently recover , from a statistical point of view , the simulated parameters such to correct the spectrum within the noise level .",

    "[ fig : testcase3 ] we discuss the results for a m0 star with spot temperature @xmath6=3075  k and @xmath9=0.10 .",
    "the effect of such a low temperature is the change of the slope of the confidence region in the 2d plane ( left panel ) , i.e.  the ensemble of noisy spectra is consistent with spotted m0 photospheres whose temperature and filling factor are directly correlated .",
    "a careful investigation of this effect shows that this is due to the shape of late m spectra over the analyzed spectral range . as a matter of fact , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show the flux ratio between each subtype and the earlier one .",
    "we find that at early subtypes ( m4 and hotter ) the ratio has features related to the functional dependence of molecular bands profiles on @xmath20 .",
    "conversely , at later subtypes the ratios tend to flatten both in general slope and features , i.e.  late m subtypes roughly differ by just a rescaling factor with poor reshaping of the flux distribution .",
    "thus , the flux - rescaled spectrum of a spot cooler than @xmath20@xmath213100  k may be mimicked by large cool spots or small warm ones .",
    "this leads to uncertainties on @xmath6  of the order of @xmath21150  k.        this sort of degeneracy between @xmath6  and @xmath9  is particularly evident at small filling factors .",
    "if the spot coverage increases , the extent of the degeneracy ( and the width of the confidence band in the plots ) decreases , as shown in fig .",

    ", we also assemble a set of 1-spot dominant spectra by linearly combining the corresponding template with cooler templates and different filling factors ( eq .  [ eq : flux ] ) , thus mimicking the presence of photospheric spots .",
    "then , we develop and test an algorithm to fit the spotted spectra aiming at recovering the spot s temperature and filling factor .",
    "the results show that at the foreseen echo s s / n we generally recover the spot s parameters such to rectify the spectral distortions introduced by photospheric activity . moreover , the uncertainty on the corrected optical spectra in most cases is comparable with spectral noise .",
    "some caution is needed in case of poor contrast between the photosphere and the spot , i.e.  when the difference between the observed spectra and the template with the same spectral type is comparable to noise . in these cases",
    "our algorithm may erroneously diverge to the edges of the investigated parameter space . despite the correction of such a low distortion , compared with the noise level , may lead to wrong results , we remark that the correction itself is generally of little utility , as the correction is of the same order of magnitude of noise .    finally , when the spot is cooler than t@xmath213100  k , our algorithm is less accurate , in particular at @xmath9@xmath230.10 , as the uncertainty on the correction is generally larger than spectral noise .",
    "currently , we are working on different aspects of our algorithm trying to achieve better results .",
    "we are refining the selection of dm stars to improve our template library .",
    "in particular , we are analyzing in details the activity signatures of the stars aiming at ( i ) a subset of spectra with as negligible as possible activity and ( ii ) a subset of active spectra to be fitted with our algorithm .",
    "this analysis will also indicate the spectral range and activity range over which the algorithm works at best .",
    "the same analysis will also lead to the systematic characterization of photospheric activity in m stars , providing valuable information on the typical temperature and size of spots , eventually depending on spectral subtype .",
    "this study will thus provide tools to set boundaries and priors on the fitting algorithm , shrinking the searched parameter space and improving the spot s parameters retrieval .",

    "these will allow us to better constrain the uncertainty on the spectral correction .",
