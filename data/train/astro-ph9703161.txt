    "inflation is a bold and expansive idea that stands upon the tall shoulders of the hot big - bang cosmology @xcite .",
    "it holds the promise of extending the standard cosmology to times as early as @xmath2 , of addressing almost all of the pressing issues in cosmology , and of shedding light on the unification of the forces and particles of nature .",
    "inflation is ripe for testing and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory of structure formation plays a central role .",
    "while there is no standard model of inflation , there are three robust predictions : ( i ) spatially flat universe ( @xmath3 where @xmath4 baryons , cold dark matter , hot dark matter , vacuum energy , radiation , etc . ) ; ( ii ) nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gaussian density perturbations ; and ( iii ) nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "( a few would dispute the prediction of a flat universe @xcite ; however , i believe there is ample reason for calling it a robust prediction @xcite . )",
    "these predictions , together with the big - bang nucleosynthesis determination of the baryon density , @xmath5 @xcite , and the failure of hot dark matter models to account for the structure observed today @xcite , make the cold dark matter theory of structure formation an important secondary prediction .    when the cdm scenario emerged more than a decade ago many referred to it as a `` no - parameter theory '' because it was so specific compared to previous models of structure formation @xcite .",
    "however , this was enthusiasm speaking as there are cosmological quantities that must be specified in any theory of structure formation .",
    "these parameters lead to families of cdm models .",
    "fortunately , observations are becoming good enough to both decisively test inflation and discriminate between cdm models .      broadly speaking the parameters",
    "can be organized into two groups @xcite .",
    "first are the cosmological parameters : the hubble constant @xmath6 ; the density of ordinary matter @xmath7 ; the power - law index @xmath8 that describes the shape of the spectrum of density perturbations and the overall normalization of the power spectrum @xmath9 [ @xmath10 ; the level of gravitational waves , specified by the ratio of their contribution to the variance of the quadrupole anisotropy to that of density perturbations ( @xmath11 ) and the tensor power - law index @xmath12 .",
    "the inflationary parameters are in this group because there is no standard model for inflation .",
    "they are related to the scalar - field potential @xmath13 that drives inflation @xmath14 where prime indicates derivative with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the value of the scalar field when scales of order @xmath17mpc crossed outside the horizon during inflation .",
    "it should be noted that the scalar and tensor power spectra are not exact power laws ; e.g. , the variation of the scalar index @xmath8 with scale ( or running ) is given by @xcite : @xmath18 i know of no model for which @xmath19 ( exact scale invariance ) ; for several interesting models @xmath20 ; for natural or power - law inflation @xmath8 can be as small as @xmath21 ; for hybrid inflation @xmath8 can can be as large as 1.2 , or as small as 0.7 @xcite .",
    "the level of gravitational radiation can be negligible or significant , and typically , @xmath22 .",
    "the second group of parameters specifies the composition of invisible matter in the universe : radiation , dark matter , and cosmological constant .",
    "radiation refers to relativistic particles : the photons in the cbr , three massless neutrino species and possibly other undetected relativistic particles ( some particle - physics theories predict the existence of additional massless particle species @xcite ) .",
    "the level of radiation today is important as it determines when the transition from radiation domination to matter domination took place , and thereby determines the characteristic turnover scale in the present cdm power spectrum , @xmath23 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "dark matter could include other particle relics in addition to cdm .",
    "for example , a neutrino species of mass @xmath24 ( or two or more neutrino species whose mass summed to @xmath24 ) would account for about 20% of the critical density ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "predictions for neutrino masses range from @xmath26 to several mev , and there is some experimental evidence that at least one of the neutrino species has mass @xcite .    in the modern context a cosmological",
    "constant corresponds to an energy density associated with the quantum vacuum .",
    "since there is no reliable calculation of the quantum vacuum energy @xcite , the existence of a cosmological constant must be regarded as a logical possibility .",
    "the original no - parameter cdm model , or standard cdm , is characterized by simple choices for the cosmological and the invisible matter parameters : precisely scale - invariant density perturbations ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; no radiation beyond the photons and the three massless neutrinos ; no dark matter beyond cdm ; no gravitational radiation and zero cosmological constant .",
    "the overall normalization of the power spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) was determined by setting the _ rms _ mass fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath30mpc ( @xmath31 ) equal to the inverse of the bias parameter @xmath32 , allowing for the likely possibility that light ( in the form of optically bright galaxies ) is more clustered than mass .",
    "the cobe detection of cbr anisotropy on angular scales of @xmath33 to @xmath34 changed the normalization procedure . by requiring the predicted the level of cbr anisotropy to be consistent with cobe ,",
    "the power spectrum is normalized on very - large scales ( @xmath35 ) without regard to biasing .",
    "cobe also put the stake through the heart of standard cdm : cobe - normalized standard cdm predicts too much power on small scales @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "when normalizing cdm by large - angle cbr anisotropy , the level of gravitational radiation must be specified because some of the anisotropy on large angular scales could arise from gravity waves : a higher level of gravitational radiation leads to a lower level of density perturbations .",
    "the standard cdm set of parameters is not sacred ; it was simply a starting point . in making the case for @xmath0cdm",
    "i will discuss four `` families '' of cdm models .",
    "they are distinguished by their invisible matter content : standard invisible matter content ( scdm ) ; extra radiation ( @xmath36cdm ) ; small hot dark matter component ( @xmath37cdm ) ; and a cosmological constant ( @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "there are , of course , more complicated possibilities , e.g. , @xmath38cdm , etc .",
    "in reviewing the observations i will show that of these four models only @xmath0cdm is consistent with all present data .",
    "there are now more than ten independent detections of cbr anisotropy on angular scales from @xmath39 to @xmath34 and the angular power spectrum is beginning to show a doppler peak at @xmath40 ( as expected for a flat universe ) . however , the strongest constraints come from the cobe four - year data set @xcite which implies : quadrupole anisotropy @xmath41k ( for @xmath19 ) , where the error is statistical + systematic arising from galaxy subtraction , and @xmath42 .",
    "cbr anisotropy serves to normalize the power spectrum and exclude models with @xmath43 .",
    "there are three robust constraints to the power spectrum from observations of the contemporary universe : the shape derived from several redshift surveys @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; the value of @xmath44 derived from the abundance of x - ray clusters @xcite , @xmath45 ; the level of inhomogeneity on small scales ( @xmath46 ) required to insure early structure formation ( neutral gas in damped ly-@xmath47 systems at redshift four , @xmath48 @xcite ) .",
    "for all four families , there are a variety of cosmological parameters for which the cobe - normalized power spectrum is consistent with these three constraints ( fig .  2 )",
    ".      determinations of @xmath49 and @xmath50 provide powerful tests of inflation as well as discriminating between the different cdm models . at present ,",
    "the best the strongest statements that can be made are : @xmath51 , based upon the peculiar velocities of thousands of galaxies ( including the milky way ) @xcite ; @xmath52 , based upon the frequency of gravitational lensing of qsos @xcite . while a decisive determination of @xmath49 is lacking , there is little evidence to suggest that @xmath53  as predicted in all but @xmath0cdm  and much evidence that @xmath54  as predicted by @xmath0cdm .",
    "together , these two fundamental cosmological parameters have great leverage . determinations of the hubble constant based upon a variety of techniques ( type ia and ii supernovae , ir tully - fisher and fundamental plane methods ) have converged on a value between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to an expansion age of less than @xmath57 for a flat , matter - dominated model ; for @xmath0cdm , the expansion age can be significantly higher , as large as @xmath58 for @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "on the other hand , the ages of the oldest globular clusters indicate that the universe is between @xmath60 and @xmath61 old ; further , these age determinations , together with the those for the oldest white dwarfs and the long - lived radioactive elements , provide an ironclad case for a universe that is at least @xmath62 old @xcite .",
    "_ unless the age of the universe and the hubble constant are near the lowest values consistent with current measurements , only @xmath0cdm model is viable .",
    "_      clusters are large enough that the baryon fraction should reflect its universal value , @xmath63 .",
    "most of the ( observed ) baryons in clusters are in the hot , intracluster x - ray emitting gas . from x - ray measurements of the flux and temperature of the gas , baryon fractions in the range @xmath64 have been inferred @xcite ; further , a recent detailed analysis and comparison to numerical models of clusters in cdm indicates an even smaller scatter , @xmath65 @xcite . from the cluster baryon fraction and @xmath66 , @xmath50 can be inferred : @xmath67 , which for the lowest hubble constant consistent with current determinations ( @xmath68 ) implies @xmath69 . _",
    "unless one of the assumptions underlying this analysis is wrong , only @xmath0cdm is viable . _",
    "since only @xmath0cdm is consistent with all the observations there can be little debate that it is the current strawman for structure formation .",
    "( unless one is willing to dispute some of the observations or their interpretations ",
    "e.g. , the hubble constant , age of the universe , or cluster baryon fraction . )",
    "further , taken together , the constraints argue for @xmath70 and @xmath71 as the best fit model ( fig .",
    "others have reached similar conclusions @xcite .",
    "at the moment , the case for @xmath0cdm hinges upon the cluster baryon fraction and measurements of the age and hubble constant .",
    "however , in the near future there are a number of tests that can distinguish @xmath0cdm from its cdm siblings .",
    "* deceleration parameter .",
    "this is the most striking test : @xmath0cdm predicts @xmath72 , while the other cdm models predict @xmath73 .",
    "two groups ( the supernova cosmology project and the high - z supernova team ) are hoping to determine @xmath74 to a precision of @xmath75 by using distant type ia supernovae ( @xmath76 ) as standard candles .",
    "together , they discovered more than 40 high redshift supernovae last fall and winter and both groups should be announcing results soon .",
    "* hubble constant . since the universe is at least @xmath62 old , a determination that the hubble constant is @xmath77 or greater would rule out all models but @xmath0cdm",
    "; on the other hand , a determination that the hubble constant is below @xmath78 would undermine much of the motivation for @xmath0cdm . * cluster baryon fraction .",
    "this strongly favors @xmath0cdm .",
    "further evidence that x - ray measurements have correctly determined the total cluster mass ( e.g. , from weak gravitational lensing ) and baryon mass ( e.g. , from axaf ) would strengthen the case for @xmath0cdm . on the other hand , discovery of a systematic effect that lowers the cluster baryon fraction by a factor of two ( e.g. , underestimation of cluster mass because gas is not supported by thermal pressure alone , or overestimation of cluster gas mass because the gas is clumped ) would undermine the case for @xmath0cdm . *",
    "gravitational lensing .",
    "it has long been appreciated that @xmath0cdm predicts a much higher frequency of gravitationally lensed qsos @xcite ; however , modelling uncertainties have precluded setting a limit more stringent than @xmath79 @xcite . with new qso lensing surveys coming gravitational lensing",
    "should not be forgotten as a striking signature of @xmath0cdm . * early structure formation . because @xmath0cdm is slightly antibiased ( fig .",
    "1 ) structure formation commences earlier .",
    "the study of the universe at high redshift by hst and keck will test this prediction .",
    "* redshift surveys .",
    "the differences in the level of biasing , power spectrum and redshift space distortions between @xmath0cdm and the other models are significant .",
    "the two large redshift surveys coming on line ( sdss and 2df ) should be able to discriminate between the different cdm models .",
    "the theoretical underpinnings of @xmath0cdm could be changed by new arguments against or in favor of a cosmological constant . * cbr anisotropy in the map / cobras / samba era",
    ". the high - resolution cbr maps that will be made by these two satellite - borne experiments will settle the issue decisively ( fig .",
    "5 )  among other things , by determining both @xmath49 and @xmath80 to better than 10% @xcite .",
    "inflation is a bold , expansive and attractive extension of the standard cosmology , and the cold dark matter theory of structure formation provides a crucial test of it .",
    "although i am not wedded to any cdm model ",
    "i will be happy to see any one proven correct ",
    "the only model consistent with all present observations is @xmath0cdm . to be fair , the case hinges upon the hubble constant and cluster baryon fraction , neither one of which has been settled completely ; however , new observations ( especially @xmath74 ) should clarify matters soon .",
    "to end , i summarize my view of the world models discussed by this panel .",
    "@xmath0cdm is the best fit to the present data ; scdm is the most elegant ; @xmath37cdm has the most striking signature  around @xmath24 of neutrino mass ; the defect models are the most interesting ; and ocdm is my worst nightmare !"
