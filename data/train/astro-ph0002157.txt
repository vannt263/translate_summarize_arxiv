    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy is the closest known member of the local group orbiting around the milky way ( @xmath025 kpc from the sun , @xmath016 kpc from the galactic centre ) , but as a consequence of its location behind the galactic centre , it has been discovered only recently ( ibata , gilmore , irwin 1994 , 1995 ) . since this discovery it turned out that sgr presents typical features of a dwarf spheroidal : domination of an old ( @xmath410 gyr ) metal poor stellar population ( mateo et al .",

    "+ the mapping of sgr is difficult to achieve because of the combination of its low surface brightness ( @xmath5 mag.arcsec@xmath6 ) , contamination by foreground galactic stars and its large spatial extent ( at least 22@xmath78@xmath1 ) ( ibata et al .",

    "this map includes @xmath0 1500 rrab .",
    "the eastern and western box represents respectively the _ sag _ field and the _ duo _ field .",
    "the total area covered is about @xmath63 deg@xmath2 , and comprises the globular cluster m54 at ( l=5.5@xmath1,b=-14.0@xmath1 ) which is associated to sgr and located in its highest density region . the image of m54 is completely saturated until @xmath01.5 half mass radius on our plates",
    ", thus we do not expect this globular cluster to contribute significantly to our rrab sample .",
    "the spatial distribution of rrab reveals a density gradient in the se - nw direction .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ rawmap ] the rrab discovered by the macho team ( alc97 ) , confirming that these stars are the continuation of sgr +      there are two steps where the completeness of the rrab sample might be affected : first , the detection of stars becomes difficult towards the galactic centre because of the increasing stellar density , and some rrab blended by a neighbouring stars are missed .",
    "second , we might miss some rrab during the selection process .      to quantify the loss induced by the first effect we simulated a set of 250000 artificial stars with the same apparent magnitude than the detected rrab .",
    "these stars were then injected in small regions of 10@xmath31 10@xmath32 uniformly spread over the fields and we tried to retrieve them with the same detection process as for the real stars .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[complete ] displays the fraction of stars re - detected as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "filled circles are stars injected onto the _ sag _ field whereas crosses are stars simulated in the _ duo _ field .",
    "the dispersion reflects mainly the dependence on galactic longitude .",
    "one can see that while the fraction of stars re - detected in _ sag",
    "_ stays at a high level ( above 90@xmath34 ) and varies slowly , this is not the case in _ duo _ where this fraction drops abruptly to reach 40@xmath34 at b@xmath0 - 5@xmath1 .",
    "the reason for the higher variation rate in _ duo _ is that the stellar density gradient increases at a higher rate towards the galactic centre ( the mean density gradient is @xmath015 stars.arcmin@xmath6.deg@xmath64 in _ sag _ and @xmath025 stars.arcmin@xmath6.deg@xmath64 in _ duo _ ) .",
    "another feature visible on fig.[complete]b is that the loss induced by crowding is intrinsically higher in _ duo _ than in _ sag _ as can be seen in the range -10@xmath65b@xmath66 - 8@xmath1(@xmath010@xmath34 offset ) .",
    "this can be explained by the lower resolution of the iii@xmath67 emulsion in _ duo _ relative to the finer grained 4415 emulsion in _ sag _ ( parker & malin @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the lower extinction in _ duo _ ( a@xmath58/a@xmath680.7 ) results in a higher number of stars detected ( n@xmath69(duo)/n@xmath69(sag)@xmath01.25 in the overlap ) , increasing by this way the crowding .      [ [ amplitudes ] ] amplitudes : + + + + + + + + + + +    our selection process might not be able to detect variable of low amplitude . to check the dependency of completeness on amplitude we simulated a set of 1000 rrab light curves with the same time sampling as the real ones , the fourier coefficients have been taken from simon & teays ( 1982 ) . the distributions in amplitude , magnitude and period ( excluding integer fractions of a day ) of the simulated light curves were chosen in a way to match the actual distributions of the detected rrab , and the phasing was uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath70 .",
    "this set of simulated light curves was then injected in 100 regions of @xmath71 ( uniformly distributed over the fields ) from which we took the errors to deteriorate the light curves .",
    "these light curves were then reduced in the same way as the real rrab .",
    "fig.[complete]a shows the completeness levels of our selection process as a function of amplitude for the two fields , averaged over 50000 simulated light curves .",
    "the shapes of the completeness curves are nearly identical for both fields and the difference is not significant .",
    "fig.[complete]a shows that the detection rate stays above 95@xmath34 for amplitude @xmath720.8 mag , and then drops abruptly down to @xmath0 20@xmath34 at amplitude=0.5 mag .",
    "these results signify that our selection process would detect almost all the rrab with an amplitude above 0.8 mag if these were point sources .",
    "+ however , the completeness levels will differ between _ sag _ and _ duo _ because the amplitudes of the rrab measured in each filter are different , being more important on average for _ sag _ than for _ duo _ .",
    "this difference occurs because the color band of _ sag _ peaks at shorter wavelength than the color band used for _ duo _ whereas the amplitude of rrab decreases with increasing wavelength ( smith @xcite ) .",
    "a least square fit between the amplitudes of 30 rrab in common in the overlap yielded the relation @xmath73 where a@xmath74 and a@xmath75 represent respectively the amplitudes measured in _ duo _ and in _ sag _ . _ in order to construct a consistent density map , we will consider in the remainder of this paper only those rrab satisfying amplitude @xmath76 mag in sag and amplitude @xmath77 mag in duo _",
    ", where 0.54 has been derived from the above relation ( [ amprel ] ) .",
    "these cuts have been chosen both to ensure the largest sample as possible and to keep the completeness corrections at a manageable level .",
    "the corresponding corrections are 3.7% in _ sag _ and 12.3% in _ duo _ .",
    "[ [ periods ] ] periods : + + + + + + + +    some rrab are missed because their periods are close to an integer fraction of a day , this causes points of the folded light curve to accumulate in a narrow phase range .",
    "the fitted fourier series is then poorly constrained over a large fraction of the light curve and some of these stars might lie outside the ellipse of our selection process ( see fig.[r21phi21 ] ) .",
    "monte - carlo simulations shows that we miss about @xmath78 of the rrab within the range 0.49@xmath79 to 0.51@xmath79 for both fields , corresponding to a total loss of @xmath80 .",
    "+      an important point to inspect for checking the consistency between the two fields is the overlap ( fig.[overlapcomp ] ) .",
    "open circles correspond to rrab detected in the _ sag _ field with an amplitude(b@xmath81 ) @xmath72 0.60 mag . while crosses represent rrab detected in the _ duo _ field and having an amplitude(b@xmath30 ) @xmath72 0.54 mag .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the limit of each plate , their inclination is due to a slight tilt between the two plates .",
    "note that this overlap applies to the reference frames and is not necessarily constant from plate to plate .",
    "fig.[overlapcomp ] reveals that most of the rrab are detected independently in the _ sag _ field and in the _ duo _ field .",
    "however , some rrab are not detected twice and it is important to understand the reasons why these stars are missed by one of the fields :    1 .",
    "rrab not detected in the _ sag _ field ( crosses ) * eight rrab are located very close to the edge of the _ sag _ plate . such stars usually have fewer points in their light curves because the centre of the plate is not exactly the same at each exposure . for example the three westernmost stars in the _ sag _ field have respectively 47 , 55 and 47 points in their light curve ( instead of 69 for most of the other light curves ) . * two rrab did not pass through the selection process ( one because of its estimated b@xmath30 amplitude and the other one because of its @xmath82 ) .",
    "2 .   rrab not detected in the _ duo _ field ( open circles ) * one rrab has not been detected probably because of its low amplitude ( 0.61 mag in _ sag _ ) . *",
    "two rrab have a period of nearly @xmath0 0.50@xmath79 and were detected in _ sag _ only by chance . *",
    "three rrab were blended by a nearby star . as stated above , _ duo _ is more sensitive to crowding than _ sag _ and the relative loss of three rrab in the overlap is fully consistent with the @xmath010@xmath34 offset observed in fig.[complete]b in the range -10@xmath65b@xmath66 - 8@xmath1 .",
    "most of the missed rrab will therefore have no statistical incidence and should not bias the density map .",
    "the only concern is for the greater sensitivity of the _ duo _ field to crowding . however",
    "this effect should be lowered by the crowding correction .",
    "turning now to the western edge of _ duo _ we re - detect 7 rrab out of the 8 detected by the macho team in our field ( disregarding two rrab located close to the edge ) .",
    "this is a satisfactory result .",
    "a surface density map is constructed from rrab with the amplitude cuts stated above .",
    "the spatial distribution of these rrab has been convolved with a gaussian on a grid with a step of @xmath83 and a variable filter size adapted to the local surface density @xmath84 , constrained between 0.2@xmath1and 0.5@xmath1 .",
    "this map was then corrected for the different completeness in amplitude and crowding ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the resulting map is shown on fig [ contmap ] where the elongated shape of sgr is clearly visible .",
    "this is the first map of sgr in these regions , showing that sgr extends far beyond the outer limit of the map previously published by iwgis .",
    "one of the most striking features of this map is the slow decrease ( if any ? ) of the density along the main axis of sgr for @xmath13b@xmath149@xmath1 .",
    "+ the main source of uncertainty in the surface density is the poissonian noise in the star counts , which is variable over the field and tends to increase towards lower @xmath13b@xmath13 . to estimate this noise we simulated 1000 maps by injecting 1400 stars ( corresponding to the number of rrab actually used to construct the final map ) onto the field with a probability density matching the surface density of the real map .",
    "these spatial distributions were then processed exactly in the same manner as the real one and a 1@xmath3 `` noise map '' has been deduced .",
    "this map is shown on fig.[sigma_map ] where the contours are labelled in percent .",
    "the typical ( relative ) uncertainty is constrained between 10@xmath34 and 15@xmath34 over the main part of the field , but increases up to @xmath040@xmath34 towards the edges where the number of rrab drops .",
    "the position angle of sgr has been determined by fitting an exponential to the surface density along various directions .",
    "the highest scale length was reached for an angle of 108.4@xmath1 , which we choosed as the direction of the major axis .",
    "fig.[sgrprof ] displays the density profile of sgr along that axis .",
    "this figure is based on a map smoothed on a constant scale of 0.5@xmath1 .",
    "the thick line is the density after correction for completeness whereas the dotted line is the density before that correction .",
    "the shaded region represents the 1@xmath3 uncertainty issued from simulated maps .",
    "a discontinuity in the slope is clearly visible at @xmath06@xmath1from the centre .",
    "after this point the surface density seems to be almost constant .",
    "it is however disconcerting that this discontinuity occurs near the limit between _ duo _ and _ sag _ and we may wonder if this is not an experimental effect .",
    "we have shown in section 3 that the crowding correction in _",
    "sag _ and _ duo _ were consistent with the completeness of each field in the overlap . furthermore the break is also perceptible in the uncorrected density so it can not be an effect of the crowding correction .",
    "another possibility is that our amplitude cut in _ duo _ is to low to be consistent with _ sag _ .",
    "this is difficult to check and we can only rely on those 30 rrab in common in the overlap , from which we derived the relation in amplitude between _ duo _ and _ sag _ ( eq .",
    "[ amprel ] ) . however , if we make the assumption that the rrab population is homogeneous over the field , it is possible to search for the relation @xmath85 for which the amplitude distributions are the most similar ( through kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "the resulting coefficients were a=0.95 and b=-0.08 and are within the error bars stated in eq .",
    "[ amprel ] .",
    "the corresponding cuts are @xmath86 .",
    "these cuts would have reinforced the discontinuity , showing that our adopted amplitude cuts are not responsible for the break observed in fig .",
    "[ sgrprof ] .",
    "we conclude that the discontinuity in the slope of the density profile is probably real and not a consequence of the change of field .",

    "finally the minor axis is not present within our field and instead we fitted an axis making a large angle relative to the main axis ( 50 @xmath1 ) , referred to as _ min _ .",
    "the fit of model l on _ maj10_has been performed by fitting the density before 6@xmath1and after 6@xmath1separately . in order to get uncorrelated points for the fit",

    "model k and g also give an acceptable fit to the core of sgr but they fail to reproduce the high density in the first bin .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainties on the parameters of the empirical king model are quite large and the infinite tidal radius is rather unrealistic .",
    "+ finally , the best fit on _ min _ is achieved by model g ( @xmath107=1.75 ) , but again it fails to reproduce the high density of the first bin . the only model that reproduces the high central density is model e but the @xmath107 of this model is worsened by the poor fit on the three last bins .",
    "however these bins contain only very few points ( between 1 and 5 ) , introducing uncertainties induced by small - numbers statistics .",
    "to summarize , we presented the detection of @xmath01500 rrab stars located in the sgr dwarf galaxy . a surface density map based on the spatial distribution of these variables unveiled the structure of this dwarf galaxy in a region that was still almost unexplored so far between b=-14@xmath1and b=-4@xmath1 .",
    "the core of sgr is best fitted by an exponential with a scale length of 4.1@xmath1along the major axis .",
    "a cross section of this density map revealed a break in the slope occurring at @xmath06@xmath1from the highest density region of sgr and an almost flat density past the break .",
    "+ although the break coincided with the change of field we have shown that this is unlikely to be an experimental effect since it is also perceptible in the uncorrected density , whereas the _ duo _",
    "field is intrinsically more sensitive to crowding than _ sag _ ( lower resolution , lower extinction ) .",
    "also , as shown in section 4.2 , the amplitude cuts used in this study can not be considered as responsible for the break .",
    "finally , could this break be a consequence of an overestimation of the completeness correction in _",
    "duo _ relative to _ sag _ ? though not excluded , this would be in conflict with what is observed in the overlap where 3 rrab blended by a neighbouring star were detected in _",
    "sag _ and missed in _ duo _",
    ", a result that is quite consistent with the corrections actually applied .",
    "we argue therefore that the break is real .",
    "the significance of the break relative to an exponential with a scale length of 4.1@xmath1is @xmath02@xmath3 .",
    "mom also observed a break in their density profile in the southern extension of sgr .",
    "however neither the location ( 20@xmath1from the centre ) nor the density at the break location ( @xmath10929.0 mag.arcsec@xmath6 ) are consistent with our values ( 6@xmath1and @xmath026.7 mag.arcsec@xmath6 ) implying that either the main body of sgr is not symmetric or these `` post - break '' stars are not directly related to it .",
    "+ another striking feature revealed by the surface density profile is its flatness past the break .",
    "this feature relies on the accuracy of the completeness correction over the field , a correction that becomes quite important at low galactic latitudes ( up to 60@xmath34 ) . yet",
    ", the difficulty of modeling point spread functions on photographic plates ( due to non - linear response of the emulsion ) and potential systematic errors caused by differential sensitivity over the plate makes the crowding correction rather uncertain .",
    "therefore , although our completeness corrections are fairly consistent within the overlap , we can not exclude that the flatness of the density profile in the outer regions is a consequence of an overcorrection .",
    "wide - field high resolution imaging would be necessary in these extremely crowded regions ( up to @xmath010@xmath110 stars per square degree at our magnitude limit ) to confirm or to rule out this issue .",
    "nevertheless , even if we consider that our completeness corrections are overestimated by a factor of 2 ( a quite conservative estimate ) , it remains that the density profile decreases slowly in the outer regions and sgr may well be extending even further out towards ( beyond ? ) the galactic plane .",
    "+ johnston et al .",
    "( @xcite ) recently modeled the sgr stream as a superposition of a main body and tidal streams of stars stripped on previous peri - centric passages .",
    "this scenario has been worked out to explain both the break observed by mom and the possible detection of stars in the outer region of sgr with different radial velocities relative to those of the main body ( majewski et al .",
    "@xcite ) . similarly",
    ", spectroscopic observations on our rr lyrae catalogue could allow to determine the nature of the stars in the outer region : if these stars are linked to the main body of sgr , then they should share almost the same radial velocities as the main body ( apart of a gradient along the main axis due to the rapidly varying galactic potential ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the break we observe corresponds to a transition between the main body and an unbound tidal stream from a previous orbit , it is likely that the two objects will have different radial velocities .",
    "this new catalogue of rr lyrae is an interesting opportunity to study further a region of sgr that has been poorly investigated so far .",
