    "the instability of an electron gas due to strong electron correlations at the conditions of dhva effect resulting in diamagnetic phase transition ( dpt ) into inhomogeneous diamagnetic phase ( idp ) with formation of condon domains ( cds ) @xcite , @xcite is intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the realization of intrinsic structure of idp is governed by the competition between long - range dipole - dipole interaction and short - range interaction related to the positive interface energy with typical magnetic length of larmor radius @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are striking similarities between idp in normal metals and other strongly correlated systems which undergo phase transition on temperature and magnetic field with formation of complex macroscopic patterns , e. g. the type - i superconductors and thin magnetic films with quality factor exceeding unity .",
    "the different technics , including the powder pattern and magneto - optic methods , successfully used for observation of intermediate state of type - i superconductors revealed a very rich structure @xcite which in spite of all it complexity , amazingly reminds the variety of domain structures in thin film @xcite .",
    "the list of the phenomena can be further continued by including other strongly correlated systems which driven by the corresponding parameters exhibit the analogous many - pattern behavior , e. g. quantum hall effect system , showing the charge density wave instability with formation of stripe and bubble phases @xcite , spin - glasses @xcite , itinerant metamagnets @xcite-@xcite , the saffman - taylor instability of fluid - ferrofluid interface in rotating hele - shaw cells @xcite and langmuir monolayers @xcite . at the background of these phenomena , the model of simple lamina periodic domain structure ( pds ) of normal metals @xcite-@xcite associated with cds and used for explanation of electron instability",
    "seems to be rather simplified .",
    "indeed , the new experiments on observation of diamagnetic domains by use of a set of hall probes at the surface of the plate - like sample of silver @xcite reveal rather complicated domain structure which only at certain conditions , with tilting the sample relative to applied field , transforms into regular laminar structure similar to the observation of intermediate state of type - i superconductor @xcite .",
    "muon spin rotation spectroscopy ( @xmath1sr ) being a powerful method for investigation of complex materials was successfully used for studying cds @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the series of excellent experiments on investigation of diamagnetic instability by methods of @xmath1sr spectroscopy @xcite-@xcite prove the existence of cd phase in beryllium , white tin , aluminum , lead and indium , but reveal also contradictions in attempts of quantitative analysis in the framework of existent theoretical considerations .",
    "the specific case of evolution of domain structure for two - dimensional electron gas in ultra - thin magnetic films with finite thickness @xmath2 was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the electron system undergoes the phase transition into a domain state which can cross over into a modulated , or vortex , state with decreasing of the sample thickness .",
    "the consideration was restricted by the center of the period of dhva oscillations .",
    "while it is known that idp occupies only a part of dhva period , it would be extremely interesting to investigate the morphology of the domain patterns with the change of the magnetic field within one dhva period .",
    "the influence of magnetic field on pds at the conditions of diamagnetic instability was investigated in @xcite where the dependencies of the period of domain structure on magnetic field and film thickness were calculated numerically .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated by numerical calculations that the width of the domains with favorable direction of magnetization increases and the width of the domains with unfavorable direction of magnetization decreases with field goes away from the center of dhva period .",
    "the transformation of pds into modulated state near the critical point @xmath31 at the center of dhva period was also illustrated .",
    "unfortunately , the critical fields corresponding to transitions between different domain structures within dhva period , including bubble lattice , separated bubbles and so on were not calculated and the phase diagrams were not constructed .    in @xcite",
    "the equilibrium set for the system of strongly correlated electron gas at the conditions of dhva effect was investigated in the framework of catastrophe theory .",
    "it was shown that in every period of dhva oscillations the discontinuities of order parameter accompanied dpt is handled by riemann - hugoniot catastrophe implying the standard scenario for dpt , e.g. dpt is of the second order at the center of dhva period , weakly first order in the nearest vicinity of this point and is of the first order at the rest part of the dhva period .",
    "thus , similar to other magnetic systems , e. g. the spin @xcite and metamagnetic ones @xcite , the dpt can be realized in rich background of nonuniform phases depending on the shape of the sample .",
    "the studies of diamagnetic instability @xcite are based on postulates of the phase theory when the irreversibility effects are ignored , and the results are applied for ellipsoidal uniformly magnetized phases in uniform external magnetic field . thus , the shape effect accounted for by use of the conception of demagnetizing coefficient @xmath4 consists in expansion of the magnetic field range for idp existence @xmath5 with increase of @xmath4 .",
    "the calculations based on bifurcation theory allows to eliminate all possible stable equilibria of the strongly correlated electron system , but the conclusion about realization of non - uniform states and evolution of idp can be done only on the basis of consideration of global minimum of the free energy of a system for given configuration of domain patterns , including the energy of long - range dipole - dipole interaction , the energy of the interphase boundaries and the magnetic energy in applied field .",
    "the calculations become a rather complicated problem due to existence of non - local dipole - dipole interaction which can not be accounted for by use of demagnetizing coefficient contrary to the studies performed in the framework of phase theory .",
    "although , the relevant problems were solved in the physics of magnetism of spin origin @xcite , the general picture of formation of non - uniform phases is complicated by the electron correlations due to non - local magnetic interaction between electrons @xcite .",
    "using the methods developed in the physics of magnetic materials , for a plate - like sample we calculate the phase diagrams related to complicated intrinsic structure of idp which can realized through the formation of variety of different domain patterns , including modulated states in the nearest vicinity of critical point and regular parallel band domains which transferred into separated band domains , close - packed bubble lattices and isolated bubbles with changing the small - scale magnetic field @xmath6 within one period of dhva oscillations .",
    "we show that evolution of domain structure with temperature is different at the center of the period of dhva oscillations and its other part within the range of existence of idp .",

    "the steady - state domain size is defined by competition between long - range dipole - dipole interaction and short - range electron interaction on the scale of @xmath0 and calculated by standard method based on minimization of total energy containing two terms , e. g. dipole - dipole energy energy and surface energy of separation of two domains @xcite .",
    "away of the center of dhva period the transition is of the first order and takes place at lower temperature . at this condition",
    "the crossing of bifurcation set leads to appearance of additional local minimum in free energy . the energy corresponding to this new minimum is higher than the energy of the previous state .",
    "but , even in this case the formation of non - uniform phase can decrease the net energy due to decrease of magnetostatic energy .",

    "<S> based on shoenberg assumption of magnetic flux density dependence of diamagnetic moments which accounts for an instability of strongly correlated electron gas at the conditions of dhva effect and diamagnetic phase transition ( dpt ) to non - uniform phase , we investigate the morphology of the condon domains ( cd ) in plate - like sample theoretically . at one period of dhva oscillations the intrinsic structure of inhomogeneous diamagnetic phase ( idp ) </S>",
    "<S> is governed by the first order phase transitions between different non - uniform phases similar to the high - anisotropy magnetic systems of spin origin , and strongly affected by temperature , magnetic field and impurity of the sample due to the electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams of evolution of idp with temperature and small - scale magnetic field in every period of dhva oscillations are calculated . </S>"
