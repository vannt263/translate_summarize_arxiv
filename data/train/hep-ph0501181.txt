    "in the two - body @xmath1 decay into light vector - mesons , the vector mesons should polarize longitudinally according to the simple @xmath5 power counting in the perturbative picture .",
    "the measured values of the longitudinal decay fraction @xmath6 are close to unity for the @xmath7 modes@xcite in good agreement with this theoretical prediction .",
    "quantitatively more reliable calculation can be made for @xmath8 with the heavy - quark symmetry and the experimental value of @xmath9@xcite agrees with theory@xcite .",
    "however , this simple prediction unexpectedly broke down for the decay @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 turned out to be approximately 0.5 for @xmath10 ; @xmath11 the observed value for the charged mode @xmath12 is consistent with them ; @xmath13@xcite . as for the @xmath14 modes ,",
    "the situation is inconclusive at present since the numbers given by babar and belle collaborations are not perfectly consistent with each other ;",
    "@xmath15@xcite vs @xmath16@xcite .    dominance of the longitudinal helicity is a direct consequence of the fact that the weak and strong forces are both mediated by gauge interactions , that is , chirality - conserving vector - axial - vector interactions .",
    "the longitudinal dominance should hold for all types of the decay interaction , either the tree or the penguin type , of the standard model . in the limit that the light quark ( @xmath17 ) masses are zero and the valence @xmath18 are collinear inside fast mesons ,",
    "the longitudinal fraction @xmath6 would be unity for all of @xmath7 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath21-quark in @xmath20 and the @xmath22-quark in @xmath7 should not be important if the strong interaction is strictly perturbative except at hadron formation .",
    "there are two conceivable origins of the large transverse polarization in @xmath23 .",
    "the first one is breakdown of short - distance qcd dominance .",
    "that is , the strong interactions at long and/or intermediate distances may be somehow enhanced and cause helicity flip of quarks .",
    "for instance , if on - shell charm - anticharm meson intermediate states are important in the decay @xmath0 , spins of slow charmed hadrons could flip with long - distance interactions and this effect would propagate into the light mesons in the final state@xcite .",
    "but our limited knowledge of dynamical parameters of the charm hadron sector makes a reliable estimate difficult .",
    "another proposal has been made from the perturbative side : it was argued@xcite that soft collinear quarks and gluons can enhance the annihilation decay process , which would be otherwise subleading in @xmath5 .",
    "although the spin flip cost another @xmath5 , the soft - collinear loop corrections in the annihilation decay might generate significant helicity flip in the case of @xmath20@xcite .",
    "while one can parametrize such an effect , numerical estimate is subject to the uncertainty in the infrared and collinear cutoff . yet",
    "another proposal is that the color - dipole decay operators may be nonperturbatively enhanced to generate a large transverse polarization@xcite .",
    "many different proposals are being made to point to possible sources and mechanisms of the long - distance interactions responsible for the large transverse polarization of @xmath20 .",
    "however , it is not clear at present whether any of these proposals will really explain it as a strong interaction effect .",
    "if the origin is not in strong interaction , a nonstandard decay interaction must be responsible .",
    "is there a new decay interaction whose chirality structure is different from the standard gauge interaction ?",
    "the case for such a new decay interaction is severely constrained .",
    "fist of all , a new interaction must be of the scalar - pseudoscalar or the tensor type.-@xmath24 interaction arising from fierz rearrangement of the penguin operators does not solve the problem . ]",
    "it should couple preferentially with the @xmath21-quark if the problem exists only in @xmath20 , not in @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore the coupling should not have the quark - mass suppression @xmath25 unlike the standard higgs coupling .",
    "while the possibility of the tensor weak coupling was pointed out@xcite , it is yet to find a way to incorporate such an _ ad hoc _ interaction in the context of the electroweak gauge theory .",
    "the fundamental issue is whether the breakdown of the helicity rule is due to failure of the perturbative picture or to a new weak interaction .",
    "if nonperturbative strong interactions are responsible , how and where do they enter the decay processes ?",
    "in addition to the pursuit from the theoretical side , more experimental information will help in reaching the root of the problem .",
    "study of the decay @xmath26 such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be useful for this purpose .",
    "indeed the first crude measurement of polarization has been made for the latter@xcite .",
    "we call attention here usefulness or relevance of the two - body baryon decays to the issue raised by the two - body meson modes . for instance",
    ", if large long - distance physics enters @xmath0 through the soft collinear corrections to the annihilation process , the violation of the helicity rule would smaller in the corresponding baryonic decay modes since the annihilation decay is suppressed more severely for the baryonic decays than for the mesonic decays . as for the exotic decay interaction , one advantage of the baryonic decay over the mesonic decay",
    "is that the dominant helicity amplitude is sensitive to the right - handed current .",
    "the helicity rule in the baryon - pair modes was discussed in an early paper by krner@xcite .",
    "he studied the baryonic decays with the tree interaction of @xmath29 using dynamical models for additional @xmath18 emission .",
    "now the penguin interaction is of our primary concern because of the @xmath20 puzzle .",
    "we distinguish between the two processes here and present the results in a way relevant to the current issue of the @xmath20 polarization .    in the case of @xmath3 ,",
    "separation of the decay amplitudes into opposite - sign helicities @xmath30 requires measurement of the @xmath31-wave interference between the resonant @xmath32 and the nonresonant @xmath33 background@xcite or a three - body decay correlation for some modes@xcite or else the angular correlation between decay products of different parents@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the helicity amplitudes of @xmath34 in the baryonic decay can be easily separated with the angular analysis of a single hyperon in the final state if the decay violates parity .",
    "it is done as part of hyperon identification .",
    "although the branching fractions of the baryon - pair modes are small according to early indications@xcite , the simplicity in analysis will work to our advantage and allow us to accomplish the goal with much smaller samples of data on the baryonic modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after a brief review of the perturbative helicity selection rule for @xmath3 and its comparison with the data in section ii , we discuss the helicity rule for the baryon - antibaryon pair modes in section iii . in section",
    "iv we discuss how to extract helicity information from measurement and then select the baryonic modes that are useful for our purpose . we will not attempt detailed dynamical computation of the baryonic decay amplitudes since despite numerous theoretical efforts over years@xcite the results are numerically less reliable for the baryonic modes than for @xmath3 .",
    "instead we quote only semiquantitative estimates which are based primarily on simple perturbative dynamics and symmetry , not on the specific form factors or the value of @xmath35 .",
    "such crude estimates are in good agreement with experiment for @xmath3 other than @xmath20 and @xmath19 . in section",
    "v , we summarize our results and discuss prospects in theory and experiment .",
    "the perturbative helicity rule in b decay is based on two facts of the standard model .",
    "first , the weak and strong interactions are both gauge interactions so that , whenever a light quark pair is produced , its chirality is given by @xmath36 or @xmath37 , not @xmath38 nor @xmath39 .",
    "picks up @xmath40 through the light quark pair production @xmath41 . ]",
    "the energetic quarks may be produced either directly by the decay interaction or through the hard gluon interaction .",
    "the quark chirality does not change by emission nor absorption of hard gluons . secondly",
    ", final hadron states are formed in the leading order by superposition of valence quarks with the light - cone wavefunctions .",
    "therefore , helicity of a fast hadron is determined by helicities of its energetic constituents , @xmath42 for mesons and @xmath43 for baryons .",
    "the terms neglected in this approximation are of higher orders in @xmath5 or of higher - twist contributions in terms of the wavefunctions and effective operators .",
    "breakdown of the helicity prediction therefore means that some long and/or intermediate distance strong interaction is enhanced to overcome the power suppression of @xmath5 .    under these conditions",
    "the chiral content of the energetic quarks produced in the final state of @xmath3 is : @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the quark state of @xmath46 , the subscript of @xmath47 stands for the `` spectator '' .",
    "it is understood that the colors are saturated appropriately . by parity invariance , @xmath47 has equal probabilities of spin up and down .",
    "the chiral content of eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) would not change in the limit of @xmath48 and @xmath49 even after any number of hard qcd interactons may take place .",
    "( [ int ] ) gives the chiral content of the valence quarks / antiquarks of @xmath32 not only for the spectator decay processes but also for the annihilation and exchange decay processes .    to derive the helicity rule ,",
    "consider the decay , @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 fly in parallel to form one vector meson , this meson @xmath53 ( @xmath37 ) is in the helicity state of @xmath54 . in the other meson @xmath55 ,",
    "the @xmath56 pair alone can make @xmath54 or + 1 since the spin of @xmath47 can point to either direction .",
    "but requirement of the overall @xmath57 forces the @xmath55 helicity to @xmath54 in this case .",
    "( see the first figure in fig.1 . )",
    "the same argument holds in the case of @xmath58 .    alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath52 try to form @xmath53 , helicity of @xmath53 ( @xmath39 ) is in @xmath60 , but helicity of @xmath55 ( @xmath61 ) can be only @xmath54 or @xmath62 , not @xmath63 ( the second figure in fig.1 ) .",
    "this conflicts with @xmath64 .",
    "therefore one concludes that the only allowed helicity state is the longitudinal ( @xmath54 ) state for @xmath65 .",
    "the kinematical corrections to this rule arise in @xmath40 from the transverse motion of @xmath18 inside a meson and the nonvanishing quark masses .",
    "computation of these higher - twist terms can be carried out for @xmath3 by the qcd factorization method . in the case",
    "that one of the final mesons is a charmed meson , the form factor can be computed reliably with the heavy quark symmetry . in the case of light meson pairs ,",
    "final results involve larger uncertainties due to the light - cone wavefunctions and the value of @xmath35 . without going through this computation",
    ", however , a reasonable order - of - magnitude estimate can be made as we shall do below .",
    "the @xmath60 amplitude is realized by the small _ wrong _ helicity component of @xmath51 in @xmath53 when @xmath37 form @xmath53 as @xmath66 and the right - chiral component of @xmath47 combines @xmath52 to form @xmath55 as @xmath67 . for the @xmath68 amplitude ,",
    "the wrong helicity component is needed for @xmath52 in @xmath53 and also for @xmath52 in @xmath55 . according to the chiral projection of the plane dirac wave , the wrong helicity component is suppressed by @xmath69 . the transverse motion of @xmath42 inside a meson also acts as an effective quark mass under the longitudinal lorentz transformation .",
    "consequently the effect of the internal motion on the helicity can be incorporated by replacing the ( current ) quark mass @xmath70 with the transverse quark mass @xmath71 .",
    "we are thus led to the well - known hierarchy of the helicity amplitudes @xmath72 for @xmath73 @xcite ; for the @xmath74 decay . ] @xmath75 where the bracket @xmath76 @xmath77 denotes the average over the quark momentum with the light - cone wavefunction .",
    "it is a reasonable approximation to set @xmath78 for the light mesons or a little more accurately @xmath79 by taking account of @xmath80 .",
    "with @xmath81 , eq . ( [ hierarchy ] ) is a counting rule in @xmath5 based on kinematics .",
    "it applies to decay amplitudes of a given decay operator .",
    "a total amplitude may be sum of terms from different operators in general . instead of going through detailed dynamical calculation , we proceed here with a semiquantitative estimate .",
    "let us substitute @xmath82 with its peak value of distribution @xmath83 .",
    "then we obtain with eq .",
    "( [ hierarchy ] ) the magnitude of the longitudinal fraction @xmath84 as @xmath85 if the contribution of the end points of the wavefunctions is enhanced , these numbers can deviate more from unity .",
    "they are in line with measurement for the tree - dominated @xmath7 , off by two standard deviations or more on the larger side for the penguin - dominated @xmath19 , and clearly far too large for @xmath20 which is expected to be almost purely a penguin decay . for @xmath8 .",
    "this number includes the @xmath86-quark mass effect ( with the constituent mass @xmath87 gev ) in the left - chiral @xmath88-quark state in @xmath89 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 does not deviate much from unity since it is the wrong helicity of @xmath90 in @xmath91 not of @xmath92 in @xmath89 that is needed to realize @xmath60 for this tree - decay process .",
    "it is in reasonable agreement with experiment , @xmath93 and @xmath94@xcite . ]",
    "if a longitudinal helicity amplitude consists of more than one term and large cancellation occurs between different terms , the ratio of the transverse - to - longitudinal amplitude could be enhanced .",
    "we would need suppression of factor five for @xmath95 to explain @xmath96 for @xmath20 by such cancellation , which would translate to suppression of the @xmath20 branching fraction by a factor of 25 relative to the case without cancellation .",
    "the observed values of the penguin decay branching fractions are not by order - of - magnitude off the conventional theoretical estimate .",
    "therefore , it is not easy to attribute the observed large transverse polarization particularly in @xmath20 to a strong suppression of the dominant longitudinal amplitude by cancellation :    it is tempting to attribute the large transverse polarization of @xmath20 to a new interaction of an unconventional chiral structure hidden in the penguin loop .",
    "however , as long as the strong interaction dynamics is of short distances , the right - hand weak current would not solve the problem . because the only difference of the right - handed weak interaction from the left - handed weak interaction is to interchange @xmath97 in eq.([hierarchy ] ) . to violate the helicity selection rule of eq .",
    "( [ hierarchy ] ) , such a new interaction must emit a quark pair through the @xmath98-@xmath99-@xmath24 interaction , @xmath100 , instead of @xmath101-@xmath102 interaction , @xmath103 . the effective @xmath98-@xmath99-@xmath24 interaction from the fierz - rearrangement of the left - right current interaction does not help since the helicity argument at the beginning of this section can be made equally well for the interaction prior to the fierz rearrangement . because the coefficients of @xmath98-@xmath99-@xmath24 are fixed in such a case so that only @xmath95 survives after the @xmath98-@xmath99-@xmath24 contributions are summed over .",
    "furthermore , if one has to explain that the transverse polarization is more pronounced in @xmath20 than in @xmath19 , the new interaction should affect more strongly on @xmath21-quark than on @xmath22-quark .",
    "the higgs interaction indeed follows such a coupling pattern , but the magnitude of the standard higgs coupling is far too small to be relevant .",
    "when a baryon - antibaryon pair @xmath104 is produced in @xmath1 decay with the four - quark decay interaction , an additional pair of @xmath105 or @xmath106 must be produced through strong interaction . since our interest is to test the perturbative picture of the helicity structure for the @xmath104 modes",
    ", we consider the case where the gluon producing the @xmath18 pair is hard and highly virtual as much as @xmath107 on average .",
    "this costs @xmath35 suppression , which is unavoidable and common to all perturbative @xmath104 production .",
    "krner noticed@xcite that in the tree interaction of @xmath29 , helicity mismatch occurs when the hard quark - antiquarks enter @xmath104 as valences directly from the primary decay interaction .",
    "he derived selection rules assuming no subsequent hard bend of the primary momenta .",
    "the helicity mismatch does not occur for the penguin interaction since it contains @xmath108 .",
    "once a hard gluon emission is considered , however , the tree decay process can be saved from the helicity conflict under a certain circumstance",
    ": imagine that the hard gluon emission reverses the primary quark momentum and takes away one unit of helicity . in this case the primary quark ( or antiquark ) momenta need not be parallel at the time of emission from the weak interaction .",
    "then the selection rule of @xcite is evaded .",
    "a closer inspection of the matrix element proves that the tree - decay amplitudes are indeed allowed even in the massless quark limit when a virtual gluon gives a hard backward kick to one of the primary quarks .    in our leading - order process",
    "all quark - antiquarks carry robust momenta except for the spectator , while in krner s picture the @xmath18 pair produced by a gluon is likely to be much softer .",
    "it is a dynamical question which process is more important to the actual baryonic decay modes through the tree process ; the @xmath35 suppression versus ( @xmath109 the tail of the quark distribution in the baryon ) .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to derive and test the perturbative helicity rule for @xmath104 as an extension of the helicity rule in @xmath3 .",
    "therefore we assume the perturbative picture and proceed to study the @xmath110 expansion here .",
    "let us move to our argument . in the simple perturbative picture , three quarks fly in one direction and turn into valence quarks of a baryon while three antiquarks fly to the opposite direction and turn into valence antiquarks of an antibaryon .",
    "we derive the helicity selection rule on the same assumptions as in @xmath3 .",
    "the chiral content of quarks and antiquarks is any one of the following three possibilities ; @xmath111 where colors are saturated separately among @xmath43 and among @xmath112 . in the standard model ,",
    "the @xmath113 pair can come only from the gluon interaction .",
    "therefore , the final quark state ( a ) and ( b ) are produced by either the tree or the penguin interaction , but the state ( c ) can be realized only by the penguin interaction . in these final states",
    "the antibaryon helicity can take the value of @xmath114 [ @xmath115 of ( a ) ] , @xmath116 [ @xmath117 of ( b ) ] or @xmath118 [ @xmath119 of ( c ) ] .",
    "the helicity of the baryon ( @xmath120 ) must match the antibaryon helicity to satisfy the overall @xmath57 condition .",
    "the matching is possible only in the case of @xmath116 from ( b ) since @xmath121 or @xmath118 for @xmath122 of ( a ) , @xmath123 or @xmath124 for @xmath125 of ( b ) , and @xmath126 or @xmath127 for @xmath128 of ( c ) .",
    "this helicity matching is shown in table i and depicted in fig.2 .",
    "it is easy to understand why neither the case ( a ) nor ( c ) can satisfy @xmath57 : when two pairs of quark - antiquark @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 ) fly back to back , they are in the state of @xmath131 ( or + 2 ) along the baryon momentum",
    ". then the remaining pair @xmath56 has no way to turn total @xmath132 to zero .",

    "\\(ii ) the @xmath137 in @xmath138 is in the spin - zero state and the @xmath138 spin is carried by the @xmath139 spin . since @xmath140 ( @xmath60 ) is in the spin - one state , @xmath135 can not form @xmath138 .",
    "therefore the modes @xmath141 and @xmath142 are forbidden .",

    "a few brave attempts were made in the past to compute the decay rates@xcite .",

    "this large theoretical uncertainty is not surprising since the baryonic decay rates depend on how the additional @xmath18 is created .",

    "that is , if substantial branching fractions are observed for them in future experiment , we may count them as an independent evidence against the perturbative argument .",

    "we have proposed to study the baryonic modes and collect more information about the source of the breakdown of the helicity rule .",
    "since there have already been several proposals of possible sources , we comment on what impact the baryonic modes may possibly have on the issue .",
    "if the large transverse polarization of @xmath20 arises from enhancement of the annihilation process@xcite , the same enhancement is unlikely in the baryonic modes for the following reason : the annihilation decay amplitudes for @xmath3 are expressed with the vector - meson form factors in the time - like region in the leading order .",
    "they fall off like @xmath160 at large @xmath161 in perturbative qcd , but the author of ref .",
    "@xcite suspects that the soft - collinear loop corrections enhance the amplitudes numerically and upset the power suppression of the perturbative power counting . while the baryon form factors similarly describe the annihilation processes into a baryon pair , they fall off like @xmath162 in perturbative counting@xcite .",
    "this difference in the asymptotic form factors can be traced back to the dimensions of the meson and baryon wavefunctions . barring the possibility that the soft - collinear loops overcome one more factor of @xmath163 in rate ,",

    "nonetheless , we can argue that such a nonperturbative enhancement is highly unlikely in the baryon - antibaryon decays : since the @xmath42 pair originating from @xmath168 flies back to back to form @xmath104 , it is hard to avoid the short - distance chirality suppression of @xmath169 .",
    "we therefore suspect that enhancement of the color magnetic decay does not occur in the baryonic modes .",
    "we expect that @xmath156 should be around @xmath170 even if this mechanism should be responsible for the large polarization of @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath156 deviates largely from unity in @xmath104 , a more likely source would be a large mixture of the higher fock configuration in the baryon composition .",
    "a proposal@xcite of the effective tensor four - quark interaction is ad hoc but similar to the enhanced color - gluon decay interaction in physical consequence .",

    "<S> the unexpectedly large transverse polarization measured in the decay @xmath0 poses the question whether it is accounted for as a strong interaction effect or possibly points to a hidden nonstandard weak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we extend here the perturbative argument to the helicity structure of the two - body baryonic decay and discuss qualitatively on how the baryonic @xmath1 decay modes might help us in understanding the issue raised by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find among others that the helicity + 1/2 amplitude dominates to the leading order in the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) decay and that unlike the @xmath3 decay the dominant amplitude is sensitive to the right - handed @xmath4 current , if any , in the penguin interaction . </S>"
