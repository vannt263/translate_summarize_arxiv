    "the term structure modelling in the interest rate and in the credit risk modelling has been widely adopted and extended since the original paper of heath - jarrow - morton @xcite .",
    "notably , there have appeared many important papers ( e.g. @xcite ) incorporating jump diffusions to describe the family of bond prices or the forward curves as a generalization of the classic hjm model .    in the credit risk modelling ,",
    "the conditional survival probability associated to the default time is an important quantity for measuring default risk and studying valuation of credit derivatives .",
    "let @xmath0 be a nonnegative random variable defined on a complete probability space @xmath1 equipped with a filtration @xmath2 satisfying the usual conditions .",
    "the conditional survival probability ( csp ) is defined as @xmath3 , @xmath4 . to describe the term structure of the csp",
    ", we can use both the density and the intensity point of view .",
    "on the one hand , as in el karoui et al @xcite , we assume that there exists a family of @xmath5-measurable functions @xmath6 such that the csp has the following additive representation : @xmath7 the family of random variables @xmath8 is called the conditional _ density _ of the default time @xmath0 given @xmath9 . on the other hand , similarly to the definition of forward rate , we can use the `` intensity '' point of view and the following multiplicative representation : @xmath10 where the @xmath5-measurable function @xmath11 is called the _",
    "forward intensity_. it is equivalent to assume the existence of the density or the intensity for all positive @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have the relationship : @xmath14 in the interest rate models , the time @xmath13 is always larger than @xmath12 and the forward rate has no economic interpretation for @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is noted in @xcite that to study what happens after a default event , we need the whole term structure of the conditional survival probability , that is , for all positive @xmath12 and @xmath13 . one typical example is a defaultable bond where the recovery payment is effectuated at a given maturity later than the economic default date .    in this paper , we consider the whole term structure modelling of csp and the applications to the credit derivative pricing . in the credit risk models , the default contagion phenomenon is often modelled by positive jumps in the intensity process .",
    "we take this point into modelling consideration and propose a forward intensity driven by lvy random fields . in the existing l ' evy term structure models , in filipovi et al .",
    "@xcite , the authors consider forward curve evolutions as solutions of the infinite dimensional musiela parametrization first - order hyperbolic stochastic differential equations driven by @xmath16-independent lvy processes or driven by a wiener process together with an independent poisson measure . in @xcite ,",
    "eberlein and raible present a class of bond price models that can be driven by a wide range of lvy processes with finite exponential moments .",
    "this model was further applied to describe the defaultable lvy term structure and explore ratings and restructuring of the defaultable market .",
    "the driving process of the lvy term structure model in @xcite was further extended to non - homogeneous lvy processes in @xcite .    motivated by those existing lvy term structure models and the random field models which are widely used to model various stochastic dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "we suppose that the lvy random field in our model is a combination of a kernel - correlated gaussian field and an independent ( central ) poisson random measure .",
    "the jump component described as poisson measure is similar to that used in @xcite , but it is not necessary to assume the exponential integrability condition for the characteristic measure under our framework ( see section  2 ) .",
    "the kernel - correlated gaussian field is more flexible compared to the gaussian components without kernel - correlation considered in @xcite . in fact , we can choose appropriate correlated - kernels of the gaussian field so that the models considered in @xcite can be covered ( see remark  [ rem : comparison ] ) .",
    "note that it is not genetically tractable for pricing of defaultable bonds under infinite dimensional framework as in @xcite .",
    "although we do not intend to consider the forward intensity under infinite dimensional framework as in @xcite , it has a close relationship between the ( infinite dimensional ) wiener process and the kernel - correlated gaussian field . indeed , the kernel - correlated gaussian field can product a cylindrical wiener process by establishing appropriate hilbert spaces ( see proposition 2.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "we deduce the dynamics of the csp and the associated density in this setting .",
    "in particular , we emphasize on a martingale condition , which can be viewed as an analogue of the non - arbitrage condition in the classical hjm model .",
    "for the pricing of credit derivatives , we follow the standard general framework in bielecki and rutkowski @xcite .",
    "the global market information contains both the default information and the `` default - free '' market information represented by the filtration @xmath17 , which is obtained by an enlargement of filtration .",
    "we are particularly interested in an economic default case , that is , the default does not lead to the total bankruptcy of the underlying firm and a partial recovery value is repaid at the maturity date of the bond in case of default prior to the maturity .",
    "to evaluate this `` after - default '' payment , we use the density approach in @xcite and obtain that the key quantities for the pricing of a defaultable bond are two pricing kernels , one depending on the interest rate and the default density , and the other depending on additionally the recovery rate .",
    "we assume that both the short interest rate and the default density are modelled by the l ' evy random field model and are correlated between them . for the recovery rate",
    ", we analyze firstly the simple case where the recovery rate is deterministic and then the random recovery case .",
    "we show that the pricing kernel is related to the solution of a second - order parabolic integro - differential equation and we prove , based on a result of garroni and menaldi @xcite , the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to the equation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our model setting in section [ forward intensity ] and give the martingale condition .",
    "we then analyze the dynamics of the csp and the conditional density in section [ csp ] . in section [ sec :",
    "pricing ] , we discuss the pricing of credit derivatives and in particular the defaultable zero - coupon bond . the two sections [ sec : pring - kernel1 ] and [ sec : pring - kernel2 ] focus on the pricing kernels .",
