    "globular clusters are spherical collections of stars located throughout the haloes of galaxies .",
    "once thought to be composed entirely of old metal - poor population ii stars , they are now also believed to form during interactions or collisions of galaxies , therefore containing younger stars having higher metallicities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the total masses of globular clusters range up to the order of @xmath3 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and core stellar number densities reach @xmath4 pc@xmath5 . the high core densities lead to dynamical interactions between stellar systems that are found less commonly in the galactic plane .",
    "for example , globular clusters favour the formation of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that are believed to be the progenitors of millisecond pulsars ( msps ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and hence , the fraction of msps among all pulsars in globular clusters is much larger than that in the galactic field ( @xmath697% versus @xmath611% ) . in addition , the binary msps in globular clusters tend to have higher eccentricities compared to their field counterparts , due to exchange or fly - by encounters .",
    "msps , due to their formation history , can be considered long - lived tracers of lmxbs , and therefore , constraints on the msp content of globular clusters provide unique insights into binary evolution and the integrated dynamical history of globular clusters , while determining the radio luminosity function of these pulsars helps shed light on the radio emission mechanism in action in these compact objects .",

    "this work is different in that it treats clusters individually instead of dealing with the total population .",
    "bayesian approaches to constrain the pulsar population of individual globular clusters have been used specifically for the case of young ( non - recycled ) pulsars by @xcite .",
    "this work focuses on the entire radio pulsar content of the cluster ",
    "the majority of which is made up of old ( recycled ) pulsars  and additionally , attempts to constrain luminosity function parameters jointly with population size .",

    "more recently , @xcite have verified that the observed luminosities of recycled pulsars in globular clusters are consistent with this result .",
    "assuming , therefore , that there is no significant difference between the nature of galactic and cluster populations , we investigate some of the consequences that occur when one applies this functional form to populations of pulsars in individual globular clusters .    for a log - normal ( base-10 )",

    "we are interested in the situation where we observe @xmath12 pulsars with luminosities above some limiting luminosity @xmath13 . given this sample of pulsars , we ask what constraints we can place on their luminosity function parameters , in addition to the potentially observable population size @xmath14 ( that is , the population of pulsars beaming towards the earth ) .",
    "another way of thinking about this problem is that there is a family of luminosity function parameters and population sizes that is consistent with an observation of @xmath12 pulsars above the luminosity limit of the survey , and we are analyzing the posterior probabilities of different members of this family given the observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec_bayesian ] , we describe our technique . in  [ sec_apps ] , we apply the technique to observations of a few globular clusters to determine the constraints on the luminosity function parameters and population size . later , we refine our results using _ a priori _ information on the luminosity function parameters to get a better estimate of the number of pulsars in those clusters .",

    "we have developed a bayesian technique to constrain the luminosity function parameters and population size of pulsars in individual globular clusters , given a data set that consists of the number of observed pulsars , the flux densities of the individual pulsars in the cluster and the total diffuse flux emission from the direction of the globular cluster , assuming a log - normal luminosity function .",
    "we have applied our analysis to a few globular clusters and have demonstrated the utility of this technique in constraining the aforementioned parameters .",
    "our technique is applied in two different ways  first , with no prior information , and second , assuming prior knowledge of the possible ranges of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . as shown for terzan 5 , the results for the first approach do not constrain @xmath14 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 very well due to paucity of data , but the latter two do exhibit consistency with the values found by @xcite and @xcite . for the second approach in which we assume prior information to bound @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the priors help better constrain the total number of pulsars in the cluster .",
    "the technique we have developed here should prove useful in future studies of the globular cluster luminosity function where ongoing and future pulsar surveys are expected to provide a substantial increase in the observed populations of pulsars in many clusters .",
    "in particular , we anticipate that the increased amount of data would enable us to constrain the distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 independently ( i.e. without the need to assume prior information from the galactic pulsar population ) .",
    "further interferometric measurements of the diffuse radio flux in many globular clusters could provide improved constraints on @xmath10 and @xmath11 by measuring the flux contribution from the individually unresolvable population of pulsars .",
