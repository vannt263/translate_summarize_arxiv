    "in both lagrangian and eulerian inviscid fluid dynamics , a small dissipation is normally useful to handle discontinuities in the flow ( the riemann problem ) .",
    "an artificial viscosity is introduced in sph , as a shock capturing method , to prevent particle interpenetration and to smooth out spurious heating in the flow to solve the strictly hyperbolic system of euler equations .",
    "the introduction of such a small dissipation , to solve the euler equations , is also currently adopted to produce both mass and angular momentum transport in sph physically inviscid modelling of accretion discs in astrophysics ( molteni et al . 1991 , 1994 ; lanzafame et al .",

    "efforts were accomplished in sph to solve both the `` approximate '' and the `` exact '' riemann problem , either via a reformulation of the artificial viscosity term ( balsara 1995 ; monaghan 1997 ; morris & monaghan 1997 ) or via godunov techniques ( yukawa et al . 1997 ; inutsuka 2002 ; parshikov & medin 2002 molteni & bilello 2003 ) which also include an `` intrinsic '' dissipation . in the first case ,",
    "a reformulation of the artificial viscosity could be necessary because , for `` weak shocks '' or low mach numbers , the fluid becomes `` too viscous '' and angular momentum and vorticity could be non - physically transferred . a technique to solve the riemann problem , based on a reformulation of the eos in the euler equations ,",
    "is here presented , where particle sph pressure terms are recalculated without any artificial viscosity contribution . since shock flows are non - equilibrium events of fluid dynamics , we pay attention to the fact that the eos : @xmath1 for ideal flows can not exactly be applied to solve the riemann problem .",
    "in fact such equation is strictly valid only for equilibrium or for quasi - equilibrium thermodynamic state , when the velocity of propagation of perturbations equals the sound velocity .",
    "successful results , based on some form of mathematical dissipation introduced within the strictly hyperbolic system of euler equations for ideal flows , are obtained due to the necessity to correct such congenital defect . in  2 of this paper",
    ", we briefly remind how does sph method work for ideal non viscous flows . in the same  2 we also outline",
    "which evolution has been accomplished in the explicit artificial viscosity dissipation description . instead , in  3 , we show how to reformulate the eos , according to the riemann problem for inviscid , ideal gases .",
    "applications to 1d shock tubes ( sod 1978 ) , to solve shocks are also shown in  4 .",
    "as for lagrangian ideal non - viscous gas hydrodynamics , the relevant equations ( euler equations ) are :    @xmath2    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    the most of the adopted symbols have the usual meaning : @xmath7 stands for the lagrangian derivative , @xmath8 is the gas density , @xmath9 is the thermal energy per unit mass .",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath10 has the meaning of a numerical parameter whose value lies in the range between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in principle .",
    "the sph method is a lagrangian scheme that discretizes the fluid into moving interacting and interpolating domains called `` particles '' .",
    "all particles move according to pressure and body forces .",
    "the method makes use of a kernel @xmath13 useful to interpolate a physical quantity @xmath14 related to a gas particle at position @xmath15 according to ( monaghan 1986 , 1992 ) :    @xmath16    @xmath17 , the interpolation kernel , is a continuous function - or two connecting continuous functions whose derivatives are continuous even at the connecting point - defined in the spatial range @xmath18 , whose limit for @xmath19 is the dirac delta distribution function .",
    "all physical quantities are described as extensive properties smoothly distributed in space and computed by interpolation at @xmath15 . in sph terms",
    "we write :    @xmath20    where the sum is extended to all particles included within the interpolation domain @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the number density relative to the jth particle .",
    "@xmath23 is the adopted interpolation kernel whose value is determined by the relative distance between particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "( 8) , @xmath28 represents the module of the radial distance between particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 in units of @xmath0 .    in sph formalism , equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) take the form :    @xmath29    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the mass of jth particle .    for a better energy conservation , the total energy @xmath33",
    "can also be introduced in the sph formulation :    @xmath34    of the energy equation :    @xmath35    in this scheme the continuity equation takes the form :    @xmath36    or , as we adopt , it can be written as :    @xmath37    which identifies the natural space interpolation of particle densities according to equation ( 7 ) .",
    "the pressure term includes the artificial viscosity contribution given by monaghan ( 1985 , 1992 ) and monaghan & lattanzio ( 1985 ) , with an appropriate thermal diffusion term which reduces shock fluctuations .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath38    where    @xmath39    with @xmath40 being the sound speed of the ith particle , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these @xmath45 and @xmath46 parameters of the order of the unity ( lattanzio et al .",
    "1985 ) are usually adopted to damp oscillations past high mach number shock fronts developed by non - linear instabilities ( boris & book 1973 ) .",

    "angular momentum transport is mainly due to the artificial viscosity included in the pressure terms as :    @xmath51    where terms into parentheses refer to intrinsic gas properties .    in sph conversion ( eqs .",
    "9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 ) of mathematical equations ( eqs . 1 to eq .",
    "4 ) there are two principles embedded .",
    "each sph particle is an extended , spherically symmetric domain where any physical quantity @xmath52 has a density profile @xmath53 . besides",
    ", the fluid quantity @xmath52 at the position of each sph particle could be interpreted by filtering the particle data for @xmath54 with a single windowing function whose width is @xmath0 .",
    "so doing , fluid data are considered isotropically smoothed all around each particle along a length scale @xmath0 . therefore , according to such two concepts , the sph value of the physical quantity @xmath52 is both the superposition of the overlapping extended profiles of all particles and the overlapping of the closest smooth density profiles of @xmath52",
    ".      strong shock require @xmath55 .",
    "however for weak shocks and for small mach number flows , the fluid becomes `` too viscous '' and both angular momentum and vorticity are transferred unphysically . to solve such problem ,",
    "several solutions are proposed :    \\a ) the formulation of a `` limiter '' ( balsara 1995 ) , multiplying the artificial viscosity terms @xmath56 for @xmath57 , where    @xmath58    it reduces the unhysical spread of angular momentum in whirling flows up to @xmath59 times .",
    "it is @xmath60 for planar shocks , while it increases if the tangential kinematics is relevant ;    \\b ) a switch to reduce artificial viscosity ( morris & monaghan 1997 ) . in this hypothesis , for each @xmath61 particle the @xmath45 evolves according to a decay equation :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the source term @xmath65 .",
    "\\c ) a reformulation of the artificial viscosity according to the riemann problem ( monaghan 1997 ) .",
    "particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 are considered as the equivalent left `` @xmath66 '' and right `` @xmath67 '' states of a given contact interface . the 1d riemann problem is taken into account along the line joining them .",
    "being the euler equations in conservative form :    @xmath68    the simplest euler technique of integration is :    @xmath69,\\ ] ]    where numerical fluxes ( mart et al .",
    "1991 )    @xmath70    where the @xmath71 are the eigenvectors of the jacobian matrix @xmath72 and @xmath73 is an average of @xmath74 for the `` @xmath66 '' and `` @xmath67 '' states .",
    "@xmath75 are the `` jumps '' of @xmath76 across the characteristics :    @xmath77    for 1d ideal flows , the eigenvalues are @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where the two including the sound velocity are the velocities of propagation of sound referred to the frame whose fluid velocity is @xmath78 . assuming that the jump in the velocity across characteristics could physically be @xmath81 and that a signal velocity @xmath82 corresponds to the above eigenvalues",
    ", @xmath83 corresponds to @xmath84 .",
    "so doing , the artificial pressure contribution in the momentum equation is :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is an arbitrary constant @xmath60 and @xmath87 .    as far as the energy equation is concerned , the sph formulation in this case is :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the signal velocities for the 1d lagrangian riemann problem on ideal flows are reported in ( whitehurst 1995 ) , on the base of gottlieb & groth ( 1988 ) and toro ( 1992 ) results . the pressure on the contact interface @xmath91 links the left and the right states . for systems with one shock and one rarefaction wave @xmath92 $ ] and    @xmath93^{2 \\gamma/(\\gamma - 1)}.\\ ] ]    in the case of two shocks , a more complicated relation ( gottlieb & groth 1988 ) also involves the velocity @xmath94 on the contact interface . however , for some practical purposes , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "in shu ( 1992 ) , some cautionary remarks are reported on the adoption of artificial dissipation .",
    "in particular , `` because the magnitude of the viscous term does not affect the net shock jump conditions , many numerical schemes implicitly or explicitly incorporate the trick of _ artificial viscosity _ for halting the ever - growing steepening tendency produced by nonlinear effects , thereby gaining the automatic insertion of shock waves wherever they are needed ( in time - dependent calculations ) . ''",
    "however , the numerical viscous term should be large enough to spread out shock transitions only over a few resolution length , making shock waves resolvable . in this sense",
    ", any mathematical dissipation should be considered a useful mathematical `` trick '' to get correct results .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem is obtained at the interparticle contact points among particles , where a pressure and a velocity , relative to the flow discontinuity , are computed .",
    "this is also clearly shown in inutsuka ( 2002 ) ; parshikov & medin ( 2002 ) ; molteni & bilello ( 2993 ) , where the new pressure @xmath91 and velocity @xmath94 are reintroduced in the euler equations instead of @xmath102 and @xmath78 to obtain the new solutions compatible with inviscid flow discontinuities . in sph , we pay attention in particular ( inutsuka 2002 ; parshikov & medin 2002 ) to the particle pressures @xmath103 and @xmath104 , in the sph formulation of the momentum and energy equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , whose substitution with pressures @xmath105 and @xmath106 , solutions of the riemann problem , excludes any artificial viscosity adoption , although a dissipation , implicitly introduced , is necessary .",
    "therefore , the solution of the lagrangian riemann problem , only in its pressure computation , is enough to interface sph with the riemann problem solution .",
    "the key concept is that the physical interpretation of the application of the artificial viscosity contribution in the pressure terms corresponds to a reformulation of the eos for inviscid ideal gases , whose equation :    @xmath107    is strictly applied in fluid dynamics when the gas components do not collide with each other . in the case of gas collisions , it modifies in :    @xmath108    the further term takes into account the velocity of perturbation propagation ( monaghan 1997 ) .",
    "this velocity equals the ideal gas sound velocity @xmath109 whenever we treat non collisional gases in equilibrium or in the case of rarefaction waves .",
    "instead , it includes the `` compression velocity '' : @xmath81 in the case of shocks ( eq .",
    "29 ) . in the first case",
    ", we write the eos for inviscid ideal gases as :    @xmath110    where @xmath111^{1/2}$ ] . instead , in the second case",
    ", the new formulation for the eos is obtained squaring @xmath112 , so that @xmath113 is an energy per unit mass in the case of shock . hence :    @xmath114    in the sph scheme , being :    @xmath115    @xmath116    this formulation introduces the `` shock pressure term '' @xmath117 , whose linear and quadratic power dependence on @xmath81 is analogue to both the linear and the quadratic components of the artificial viscosity terms ( 15 ) .",
    "the linear term @xmath118 is based on the viscosity of a gas .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath119 ( von neumann - richtmyer - like ) is necessary to handle strong shocks . these contributions involve a dissipative power , whose effect corresponds to an increase of the gas pressure .",
    "therefore , we adopt the formulation ( eq .",
    "21 ) as @xmath120 and @xmath121 in the sph formulation of the momentum ( eq . 9 ) and energy equations ( eqs . 10 or 11 ) :    @xmath122    @xmath123    @xmath124    this simple reformulation , allows us to to keep the same courant - friedrichs - lewy condition as for the timestep computation , substituting only the sound velocity @xmath109 with @xmath125 .",
    "in this section a comparison of analytical and our sph - riemann 1d shock tube test results ( sod 1978 ) , also with the initial particle configuration ( time @xmath126 ) , is made .",
    "notice that the so called analytical solution of the riemann problem is obtained through iterative procedures left - right , applying to the discontinuity the rankine - hugoniot `` jump '' solution .",
    "1 and 2 shows results concerning the particle density , thermal energy per unit mass and velocity at the same final computational time ( @xmath127 ) . throughout our sph - riemann simulations ,",
    "the initial particle resolution length is @xmath128 .",
    "the whole computational domain is built up with @xmath129 particles from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , whose mass is different , according to the shock initial position . at time @xmath126 all particles are motionless .",
    "@xmath132 , while the ratios @xmath133 and @xmath134 in fig . 1 , and @xmath133 and @xmath135 in fig . 2 , between the two sides left - right .",
    "the first @xmath136 and the last @xmath136 particles of the 1d computational domain , keep fixed positions and do not move .",
    "the choice of the final computational time is totally arbitrary , since the shock progresses in time .",
    "results , where our sph - riemann solution is applied to sph , are in a good comparison with the analytical solution .",
    "discrepancies involve only 4 particles at most .",
    "this means that , according to the cautionary remarks on  2.3 , the physical dissipation introduced in the eos ( eqs .",
    "37 , 38 ) is effective .",
    "any artificial viscosity contribution is totally absent , as well as no thermodynamic properties of neighbour particle are involved , as the application of godunov - type solver ( yukawa 1997 ; inutsuka 2002 ; parshikov & medin 2002 ; molteni & bilello 2003 ) does .",
    "the comparison of 1d sod shock tube analytical results with sph - riemann ones , where a revision of the eos within the riemann problem is made , are quite successful .",
    "in particular , in our modelling , neither a parametrized artificial viscosity , nor any dependence on spatial resolution length @xmath0 , nor a godunov solver , nor additional computational time are involved . however , to give a generalization , we need only one general eos and not a separation of the eos according to the kinematic of the flow . to this purpose , we can generalize the eos : @xmath137 as :          where @xmath143 .",
    "@xmath144 is a large number describing how much the flow description corresponds to that of an ideal gas . to this purpose , @xmath145 ,",
    "being @xmath146 the molecular mean free path , and @xmath147 the mean linear dimension of gas molecules .",
    "further , improvements can be made next future .",
    "the comparison with analytical results of 1d sod shock tubes in the same test in  4 gives us the same results showed in figg . 1 and 2 .",
    "the simple eos for inviscid ideal gases : @xmath1 can not be strictly applied in shock problems by the fact that , solving the euler equations , not only instabilities and spurious heating come out , but also that this empirical eos derived by charles , volta gay - lussac and boyle - mariotte laws , should be strictly applied only either in equilibrium configurations or to `` quasi - static '' evolutions of thermodynamic systems without any dissipation .",
    "this is a restriction that does not match with shock flow dynamics , when dissipation on the shock front can not be neglected .",
    "those techniques involving godunov - type schemes also introduce some dissipation mechanisms ( park & kwon 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , according to these schemes , the solution of euler equations is made possible because of dissipative mechanisms introduced in the numerical methods ."
