    "such as the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , the complex cubic - quintic ginzburg - landau equation ( ccqgle ) is one of the most intensively studied equation describing weakly nonlinear phenomena in dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "thus , much work has been done about the features and the properties of this equation as well as its numerous applications such as nonlinear waves , superconductivity , superfluidity @xcite , bose - einstein condensation , bnard convection @xcite and nonlinear optics @xcite . + solitary waves ( or solitons ) are self localized solutions of certain nonlinear pdes describing the evolution of a dissipative system @xcite . whereas traditional solitons are stationary in time and preserve their shape upon interaction , some dissipative soliton solutions of the ccqgle are non stationary . in hamiltonian systems ,",
    "stationary solitons exist as a result of a balance between diffraction / dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "however , a dissipative system is known to be far from equilibrium and is defined by energy exchanges with external sources . thus , there is no conserved quantity , which implies that they are not hamiltonian systems . in dissipative systems ,",
    "solitons are obtained by balancing gain and loss . as a result , whereas solutions are defined by one parameter family in hamiltonian systems , in dissipative systems solutions are obtained with varying amplitude and width that are fixed by the parameters of the equation .",
    "therefore , the inverse scattering method @xcite which is used to calculate solutions of integrable and some non integrable hamiltonian systems can not be used in our case . in this paper , we present new classes of soliton solutions of the ccqgle and we analyze both their shape and energy evolution that depends strongly on the parameters used , and choice of initial conditions .",
    "the development of powerful numerical tools over the last decades lead us to use an accurate spectral method for the spatial discretization , together with a @xmath0 order adams - bashforth scheme for temporal discretization . due to the intensive computations codes in fortran 90 , we run simulations on zeus cluster ( 256 nodes dual xeon 3.2 ghz processors , 1024 kb cache 4 gb with myrinet ) at embry - riddle aeronautical university . for each class of solitons , simulations lasted from several hours to several days .",
    "numerical simulations are based on the 2d ccqgle model with transverse laplacian @xmath1 that takes into account spatial diffraction in the paraxial wave approximation .",
    "quintic terms are essential in order to obtain stable solitons @xcite @xmath2 @xmath3 is the normalized envelope of the field which is a complex function , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the transverse spatial coordinates and @xmath6 is the propagation distance along the optical fiber ( or cavity depth ) .",
    "the physical parameters of the system are : @xmath7 linear gain / loss , @xmath8 angular spectral filtering , @xmath9 second - order diffraction coefficient , @xmath10 nonlinear gain / loss , @xmath11 nonlinear dispersion , @xmath12 saturation of the nonlinear gain / loss , and @xmath13 saturation of the nonlinear refractive index .",
    "the solutions to will be computed using a fourier spectral method in which we will monitor the energy @xmath14 . for a localized solution ,",
    "@xmath15 is finite and changes smoothly while the solution stays within the region of existence of the soliton . when @xmath15 changes abruptly there is a bifurcation and the solution jumps from a branch of solitons that become unstable to another branch of stable solitons , or vice versa .",
    "as soon as the solution becomes unstable , @xmath15 diverges until infinity or collapses to @xmath16 . for a certain class of solutions",
    ", @xmath15 will evolve periodically in some regime , and will converge to a finite value @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this study is to find continuous parameter ranges around a fixed set in which each class of solitons remains stable .      first ,",
    "an initial set of parameters published in @xcite is used for the elliptic , filament , pulsating and exploding classes , while for creeping we use parameters published in @xcite , see table 1 .",
    "starting from these values , for each class we vary one parameter in a range of width @xmath17 while keeping all the other parameters constant . when we are outside of the range of existence of the solitons , we return to the initial value , and vary the other remaining parameters one by one .",
    "after several simulations , we noticed that @xmath10 and @xmath7 seemed to be the more sensitive , i.e. , small changes of @xmath10 or @xmath7 implied significant changes of the solution .",
    "thus , a step of @xmath18 has been chosen for these parameters whereas a step of @xmath19 has been used for @xmath8 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . however ,",
    "this behavior is not a general rule , so , in some cases , a smaller step has been used for the last three parameters .",

    "in conclusion , we have found fascinating ( 2 + 1)d structures in dissipative media predicted by the complex cubic - quintic ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "different types of solutions , spinning or not , such as elliptic vortex , filament , pulsating , exploding and creeping solitons have been categorized by focusing on their energy , shape and phase evolution .",
    "regions of existence of these types of soliton have also been calculated in the five dimensional parameter space given by the physical parameters of the equation .",
    "the study revealed interesting ranges and bifurcations for each structure . whereas non spinning structures have mainly lead to stable stationary solitons , due to",
    "bifurcations spinning structures , symmetric or asymmetric , split and have revealed to be no spin solitons . by changing the initial conditions , and increasing the vorticity , allowed us to observe for the first time new types of solutions such as disorganized exploding and propeller solitons .",
