    "the characteristics of the distributions of masses , ages , and positions in a newborn stellar population are determined by the process of star formation . as a result ,",
    "measurements of these distributions in star - forming regions are potentially valuable for testing models of the birth of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "for instance , the properties of the stellar initial mass function ( imf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can constrain the relative importance of turbulent fragmentation @xcite , gravitational fragmentation @xcite , dynamical interactions @xcite , and accretion and outflows @xcite in regulating the final masses of stars .",
    "models of the star formation rates of molecular clouds ( e.g. , constant , accelerating , bursts ) can be tested against the distributions of ages and positions of members of young clusters @xcite .",
    "the spatial distributions also provide insight into cloud fragmentation , binary formation , cluster dynamics , and the origin of brown dwarfs @xcite . to obtain measurements of this kind",
    ", one must identify the members of star - forming regions and estimate their masses and ages .",
    "only a few young stellar populations have been characterized in detail , such as the orion nebula cluster @xcite , taurus @xcite , and ic  348 in perseus @xcite .",
    "the chamaeleon  i star - forming region is amenable to a thorough census of its stellar population for several reasons .",

    "* ) , exhibits less extinction than many young clusters ( @xmath3 ) , is compact enough that a large fraction of the region can be surveyed to great depth in a reasonable amount of time , and is sufficiently rich for a statistically significant analysis of its stellar population .",
    "in addition , because chamaeleon  i is relatively isolated from other star - forming regions , confusion with other young populations is minimal .",
    "previous surveys have already identified more than 150 young stars and brown dwarfs in chamaeleon  i through photometric variability , h@xmath4 emission , x - ray emission , mid - infrared ( ir ) excess emission , and optical and near - ir color - magnitude diagrams ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "however , in the census of known members produced by these surveys , the completeness as a function of mass and position is unknown @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "i present a set of magnitude - limited surveys for members of chamaeleon  i that have well - defined completeness limits (   [ sec : new ] ) .",
    "i then use the new census of chamaeleon  i to measure the star formation history (   [ sec : hr ] ) , imf (   [ sec : imf ] ) , and spatial distribution of its stellar population (   [ sec : spatial ] ) .",
    "i have used optical and near - ir broad - band photometry from several sources to perform four surveys for new members of chamaeleon  i. the fields covered by these surveys are indicated in the maps of the cluster in figure  [ fig : map1 ] . the first survey ( hereafter named ik1 ) is shallow ( @xmath5 ) and covers most of the cloud complex , concentrating on the central @xmath6 area where most of the known members reside . the second survey ( ri ) also focuses on this central field , but with greater depth ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these two surveys are designed to produce an imf measurement that has good number statistics and completeness to reasonably low masses ( @xmath8  @xmath0 ) .",
    "a third survey ( ik2 ) considers a small range of masses ( @xmath9 - 0.02  @xmath0 ) across a very wide field extending well beyond the chamaeleon  i cloud .",

    "these spectroscopic targets and the previously known members appearing in these data are shown in the color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig : ik1 ] .",
    "when selecting candidates for spectroscopy , i gave highest priority to ones that are within the central @xmath6 area indicated in figure  [ fig : map1]a because i will measure an imf from members within this field (   [ sec : imf ] ) .",
    "the boundaries of this field were designed to encompass a significant fraction of the known cluster members , which favors a larger area , while minimizing contamination by field stars among the candidates , which favors a smaller area .    based on the spectral classifications performed in   [ sec : class ] , the 112 ik1 candidates that were observed spectroscopically consist of 32 members and 80 nonmembers .",

    "i also account for binaries in the manner described by @xcite , except that i assume an unresolved binary fraction of 30% , which should be a reasonable value for a sample like the one in chamaeleon  i that is dominated by low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "i now convolve the error distributions with model star formation histories and compare the results to the distributions of isochronal ages in figure  [ fig : ages ] .",

    "the northern sample exhibits a distribution of ages that is broader than the model distribution for a single burst .",
    "if the observational errors are similar between the two halves of chamaeleon  i , then the broader age distribution in the north indicates the presence of a larger age spread , and that star formation began 1 - 2  myr earlier in the northern subcluster than in the southern one .    for both the northern and southern subclusters",
    ", the burst model produces too few stars with isochronal ages less than 1  myr .",
    "indeed , the presence of protostars in this region demonstrates that star formation is ongoing @xcite .",
    "therefore , i also consider a constant star formation rate that extends to the present time .",
    "for comparison to the data in figure  [ fig : ages ] , i select a lower limit of 0.3  myr for the ages of stars in this model because most of the protostars lack spectral classifications and thus are absent from the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "the same approach was used by @xcite for taurus .",
    "after varying the upper age limit for this model , i find that values of 6 and 4.5  myr provide the best match to the data in the northern and southern samples , respectively , although they produce too many stars younger than 1 myr .",
    "the models for a burst and periods of constant star formation bracket the data for the two subclusters , which suggests that star formation has occurred for the past 3 - 4  myr in the south and 5 - 6  myr in the north at rates that have declined with time .",

    "i have inferred ages for stars in chamaeleon  i with the model isochrones of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "use of other models would produce different age estimates .",

    "thus , the shape of the distribution of isochronal ages shown in figure  [ fig : ages ] is insensitive to the choice of models , while the average age can vary by 0.1 - 0.2 in log  @xmath86 from one set of models to another because of differences in birthlines .",
    "the difference in isochronal ages between the northern and southern subclusters is consistent with the relative levels of obscuration toward their members .",

    "the apparent gradient in median age and cloud morphology between the northern and southern subclusters implies that the chamaeleon  i clouds are dissipating on a time scale of @xmath89  myr after the initiation of star formation , which is consistent with previous estimates of molecular cloud lifetimes ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , it is likely that additional systematic errors are present in these measurements . in particular , because the peak of the imf is close to the hydrogen burning limit ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : imf ] and [ fig : histo ] ) , small systematic offsets in mass estimates can result in large differences in the relative numbers of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "these offsets can arise from differences in adopted evolutionary models , temperature scales , and spectral classification systems @xcite , or from basic differences in the methods of estimating masses ( e.g. , positions on h - r diagrams versus luminosity functions ) .",
    "these sources of systematic errors are not present among the measurements that i have performed in ic  348 , taurus , and chamaeleon  i. however , because the low - mass stars in ic  348 and chamaeleon  i are segregated and low - mass stars dominate these stellar populations by number , the brown dwarf fraction is also sensitive to the size of the field in which it is measured .",
    "the fields considered in ic  348 , taurus , and chamaeleon  i are probably large enough to accurately represent the entire stellar population in each cluster , but it is possible that the brown dwarf fractions would change noticeably if they were measured from even larger fields . even in the absence of systematic errors , the modest differences in the brown dwarf fractions of these regions can be explained by slight variations in the peak mass of the imf and probably do not require a deeper explanation that is specific to brown dwarf formation .",
    "if i account for the completeness limits described in ",
    "[ sec : complete ] , i can use the current census of chamaeleon  i to characterize the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarfs in this cluster .",
    "i first investigate whether a widely - distributed population of brown dwarfs is present in chamaeleon  i. the ik2 survey was specifically designed for this question (   [ sec : ik2 ] ) . to be sensitive to members moving at high velocities ( @xmath105  km  s@xmath33 ) , such as brown dwarfs ejected from multiple systems @xcite ,",

    "however , i have shown that brown dwarfs are not more widely distributed than their stellar counterparts in chamaeleon  i. @xcite and @xcite found the same result for taurus , which also lacks an extended population of brown dwarfs . thus , embryo ejection models that predict high velocities for brown dwarfs are not viable as the dominant mode of brown dwarf formation .",
    "i next examine the spatial distributions of members of chamaeleon  i within a radius of @xmath113 from the cluster center . because i wish to compare the distributions for different ranges of spectral types , i begin by summarizing the completeness within this area (   [ sec : complete ] ) .",
    "the current census of the central @xmath6 field should be nearly 100% complete for @xmath56 ( @xmath57m8 ) and @xmath58 . outside of this field , most members at m4.5-m8 should be identified .",

    "thus , spatial distributions measured from members earlier than m8 in the current census should be accurate representations of the cluster",

    "the cluster contains too few stars at @xmath114k0 to examine their spatial distribution in detail .",

    "based on visual inspection of figure  [ fig : map5 ] , the members at k6-m2 , m4-m6 , and @xmath107m6-m8 exhibit similar spatial distributions in the southern subcluster .",

    "again , the northern m4-m6 members are less centrally concentrated than the other populations .",
    "according to two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov tests among the northern radial distributions , the probability that the m4-m6 sample is drawn from the same parent distribution as k6-m2 and @xmath107m6-m8 is 1 - 2% , while the latter two samples are consistent with each other .",

    "all of these characteristics are consistent with an increase in the accretion rate .",
    "similar variability is present in the data for cha  h@xmath4  1 and t48 , as shown in figure  [ fig : op7 ] .",
    "the variability for t48 occurred over a period of only three days .",
    "eso  h@xmath4  281 was resolved as a @xmath118 pair by @xcite .",
    "the brighter component was designated as eso  h@xmath4  281  a by @xcite and is 2mass  11070350 - 7631443 .",

    "the fainter component , eso  h@xmath4  281  b from @xcite , is not resolved from the brighter star by 2mass .",
    "it was spectroscopically confirmed as a member of chamaeleon  i by @xcite , but it was overlooked in the compilation of members in @xcite .    the spectrum of 2mass  11253653 - 7700348 has m - type spectral features but does not match any standard dwarfs , giants , or pre - main - sequence objects .",
    "thus , the luminosity class of this object is uncertain . it is unlikely to be a young star based on the absence of li absorption in its spectrum .",
    "the strengths of the na  i and k  i lines in the spectrum of 2mass  11052472 - 7626209 are suggestive of youth . however , because the variation of these lines between dwarfs and pre - main - sequence stars is subtle for the spectral type of this star ( m2.75 ) , it remains possible that it is a field dwarf .",
    "similarly , the triangular @xmath11-band continuum of cha  j11083040 - 7731387 is indicative of youth @xcite , but this object appears to have strong k  i absorption at 1.25  , which suggests higher , dwarf - like gravity . because no spectral type of field m and l dwarfs matches the spectrum of cha  j11083040 - 7731387 and the apparent strength of k  i may be due to low signal - to - noise , i assume that it is a member of chamaeleon  i for the purposes of this work .",
    "@xcite presented an optical spectrum for a putative new member of chamaeleon  i. they attributed their spectrum to 2mass  11095300 - 7730588 and named the object sgr1 .",
    "their spectrum exhibited strong h@xmath4 emission and they reported a spectral type of m7 from those data .",

    "if placed on the color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig : ri ] ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) , this star falls well below the sequence of known members , which further indicates that it is a field star rather than a member .",

    "@xcite suggested that chsm  15991 , t14a , and iso  225 are unusually faint because they are seen only in scattered light ( e.g. , edge - on disks ) , and @xcite offered the same explanation for eso  h@xmath4  574 .",
    "@xcite concluded that eso  h@xmath4  569 is more likely to have an intrinsically low luminosity rather than an edge - on disk because excess emission from a disk was not detected in mid - ir observations with iso @xcite .",

    "although it falls below the sequences of known members in those diagrams , cha  j11081938 - 7731522 was not rejected as a field star because it was red enough in figure  [ fig : ri ] to be selected as a candidate ( substellar ) member .",
    "the presence of extended emission around this star in the acs image in figure  [ fig:72422 ] supports the idea that it is seen in scattered light .",

    "iso  165 was the only star that was classified differently between the two studies .",
    "@xcite classified iso  165 as a member of chamaeleon  i because of its strong h@xmath4 emission ( @xmath1263 ) and weak na  i and k  i lines that are indicative of low surface gravity .",
    "in addition , it can not be a foreground dwarf because it significantly reddened , while it can not be a background dwarf because such an object would appear below the main sequence when placed on the h - r diagram at the distance of chamaeleon  i , which is not the case . in comparison , @xcite suggested that iso  165 might be a nonmember because it was not detected in their x - ray data .",
    "however , the spectral type of m5.5 for this object corresponds to a mass of 0.1 - 0.15  @xmath0 , which is near their completeness limit , so it is not surprising that it was not detected . in the mid - ir images from @xcite , iso",
    "165 exhibits mid - ir excess emission that indicates the presence of a disk , which provides further evidence of the youth and membership of this object in chamaeleon  i. in addition to iso  165 , seven other known members of chamaeleon  i were not detected in the x - ray data from @xcite .",
    "six of these sources have spectral types later than m7 ( @xmath127  @xmath0 ) , and thus detections were not expected since they fall below the mass completeness limit of the x - ray data .",
    "the seventh member , eso  h@xmath4  569 @xcite , has a relatively high mass of 0.4  @xmath0 based on its spectral type of m2.5 , and yet it was not detected by @xcite , which suggests the presence of extremely high extinction toward this star ( @xmath121 ,   [ sec : app1 ] ) .    using _ xmm - newton _ , @xcite obtained an x - ray image of a @xmath128 field in the southern subcluster of chamaeleon  i , which is indicated in figure  [ fig : map1]a .",

    "one of the x - ray sources from @xcite , hd  97240 ( kg  2001 - 78 ) , was treated as a possible member of chamaeleon  i in that study .",

    "i show in figure  [ fig : histox ] the distributions of spectral types for all known members of chamaeleon  i within each survey field and for the members detected in x - rays .",

    "the membership lists from @xcite and this work agree almost perfectly down to m6 , or 0.1  @xmath0 , so this effect is not a result of incompleteness in the _ chandra _ data . indeed ,",
    "my census is complete to much lower masses for most of the _ chandra _ field , and it still exhibits the deficit of low - mass stars ( figure  [ fig : histox ] ) . instead of incompleteness , the anomalous imf in the _ chandra _ field is a reflection of the segregation of low - mass stars to larger radii surrounding the northern subcluster that was described in   [ sec : spatial ] .",
    "@xcite obtained images in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , h@xmath4 , and two narrowband optical filters toward 1.2  deg@xmath130 in chamaeleon  i. with these data , they identified 69 candidate members of the cluster .",

    "only source 424 exhibits colors that are consistent with those of the confirmed late - type members .",
    "the other four candidates are too red in @xmath131 for their @xmath36 , which suggests that they are highly reddened early - type objects rather than late - type sources .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the near - ir spectra of sources 428 and 607 from @xcite , which lack the strong steam absorption that is expected for late m and l types .",
    "@xcite estimated spectral types for their 72 candidates from optical colors .",
    "the classifications of 29 candidates were later than m6 . in comparison , 15 and seven of these 29 objects",

    "thus , no more than eight of the 29 objects that were classified as later than m6 by @xcite actually have spectral types in this range .",
    "it is likely that the types from @xcite were systematically too late because of extinction . when estimating spectral types from the colors of their candidates , @xcite did not correct for extinction , which was unknown without spectroscopic data .",

    "<S> fourteen of these new members have spectral types later than m6 , which doubles the number of known members that are likely to be substellar . </S>",

    "<S> the distribution of isochronal ages indicates that star formation began 3 - 4 and 5 - 6  myr ago in the southern and northern subclusters , respectively , and has continued to the present time at a declining rate . </S>",
    "<S> the imf in chamaeleon  i reaches a maximum at a mass of 0.1 - 0.15  @xmath0 , and thus closely resembles the imfs in ic  348 and the orion nebula cluster . in logarithmic units where the salpeter slope is 1.35 , </S>",
    "<S> the imf is roughly flat in the substellar regime and shows no indication of reaching a minimum down to a completeness limit of 0.01  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the low - mass stars are more widely distributed than members at other masses in the northern subcluster , but this is not the case in the southern subcluster . meanwhile , </S>",
