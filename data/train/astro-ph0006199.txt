    "a first reference to the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) , or the `` zone of few nebulae '' was made in 1878 by proctor @xcite , based on the distribution of nebulae in the `` general catalogue of nebulae '' by sir john herschel @xcite .",
    "this zone becomes considerably more prominent in the distribution of nebulae presented by charlier @xcite using data from the `` new general catalogue '' by dreyer @xcite .",
    "these data also reveal first indications of large - scale structure : the nebulae display a very clumpy distribution .",
    "currently well - known galaxy clusters such as virgo , fornax , perseus , pisces and coma are easily recognizable even though dreyer s catalog contains both galactic and extragalactic objects as it was not known then that the majority of the nebulae actually are external stellar systems similar to the milky way . even more obvious in this distribution ,",
    "though , is the absence of galaxies around the galactic equator .",
    "as extinction was poorly known at that time , no connection was made between the milky way and the `` zone of few nebulae '' .",
    "a first definition of the zoa was proposed by shapley @xcite , as the region delimited by `` the isopleth of five galaxies per square degree from the lick and harvard surveys '' ( compared to a mean of 54 gal./sq.deg .",
    "found in unobscured regions by shane & wirtanen @xcite ) .",
    "this `` zone of avoidance '' used to be `` avoided '' by astronomers interested in the extragalactic sky because of the inherent difficulties in analyzing the few obscured galaxies known there .",
    "merging data from more recent galaxy catalogs , i.e. the uppsala general catalog ugc @xcite for the north ( @xmath0 ) , the eso uppsala catalog @xcite for the south ( @xmath1 ) , and the morphological catalog of galaxies mcg @xcite for the strip inbetween ( @xmath2 ) , a whole - sky galaxy catalog can be defined . to homogenize the data determined by different groups from different survey material , the following adjustments have to be applied to the diameters : @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite . according to hudson & lynden - bell @xcite",
    "this `` whole - sky '' catalog then is complete for galaxies larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of these galaxies is displayed in galactic coordinates in fig .",
    "[ ait ] in an equal - area aitoff projection centered on the galactic bulge ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the galaxies are diameter - coded , so that structures relevant for the dynamics in the local universe stand out accordingly .",
    "most conspicuous in this distribution is , however , the very broad , nearly empty band of about 20@xmath7 .",
    "why this zone of avoidance ? optical galaxy catalogs are limited to the largest galaxies .",
    "they therefore become increasingly incomplete close to the galactic equator where the dust thickens .",
    "this diminishes the light emission of the galaxies and reduces their visible extent .",
    "such obscured galaxies are not included in diameter- or magnitude - limited catalogs because they appear small and faint  even though they might be intrinsically large and bright .",
    "a further complication is the growing number of foreground stars close to the galactic plane ( gp ) which fully or partially block the view of galaxy images .    comparing this `` band of few galaxies '' with the currently available dust extinction maps of the dirbe experiment @xcite",
    ", we can see that the zoa  the area where the galaxy counts become severely incomplete  is described almost perfectly by the absorption contour in the blue @xmath8 of @xmath9 ( where @xmath8 is 4.14 times the extinction @xmath10 @xcite ) .",
    "this contour matches the zoa defined by shapley @xcite closely .",
    "the galaxies are diameter - coded : small circles represent galaxies with @xmath11 , larger circles @xmath12 , and big circles @xmath13 . the contour marks absorption in the blue of @xmath14 as determined from the schlegel et  al .",
    "[ 13]dust extinction maps .",
    "the displayed contour surrounds the area where the galaxy distribution becomes incomplete ( the zoa ) remarkably well , width=453 ]      why is the distribution of galaxies behind the milky way important , and why is it not sufficient to study galaxies and their large - scale distribution away from the foreground `` pollution '' of the milky way ?    in the last 20 years , enormous effort and observation time has been devoted to map the galaxy distribution in space .",
    "it was found that galaxies are located predominantly in clusters , sheets and filaments , leaving large areas devoid of luminous matter ( see @xcite for a detailed observational description of `` large - scale structures in the universe '' ) .",
    "our galaxy is part of the local group ( lg ) of galaxies , a small , gravitationally bound group of galaxies consisting of a few bright spiral galaxies and about 2 dozen dwarf galaxies .",
    "our lg lies in the outskirts of the local supercluster , a flattened structure of about 30  mpc , centered on the virgo galaxy cluster with a few thousand galaxies ( including its numerous dwarfs ) .",
    "many such superclusters have meanwhile been charted .",
    "the nearby ones can actually be identified in the 2-dimensional galaxy distribution of fig .",
    "[ ait ] : the local supercluster is visible as a great circle ( the supergalactic plane ) centered on the virgo cluster at @xmath15 , the perseus - pisces supercluster which bends into the zoa at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the general galaxy overdensity in the great attractor ( ga ) region ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "most of these superclusters and wall - like structures have massive clusters at their centers .",
    "the lack of data in the zoa severely constrains the studies of these structures in the nearby universe , the origin of the peculiar velocity of the local group , and other streaming motions .",
    "such studies are dependent on an accurate description of the whole sky distribution of galaxies , as described in the following sections .",
    "the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) of @xmath19  k  the relic radiation of the hot early universe  shows a dipole of about 0.1% .",
    "this dipole is explained by a peculiar motion of the lg on top of the uniform hubble expansion of 630  kms@xmath20  towards the galactic coordinates @xmath21 @xcite induced by the gravitational attraction of the irregular mass distribution in the nearby universe ( see fig .",
    "[ ait ] ) .",
    "part of this motion can be explained by the acceleration of the lg towards virgo , the center of the local supercluster ( @xmath22  kms@xmath20  towards @xmath23 ) .",
    "the remaining component of @xmath24  kms@xmath20  towards @xmath25 @xcite hence must arise from other mass concentrations and/or voids in the nearby universe .",
    "the determination of the peculiar motion on the lg , i.e. its net gravity field , requires whole - sky coverage . here , the lack of data in about 25% of the optical extragalactic sky is a severe handicap .",
    "various dipole determinations have assumed a uniformly filled zoa or have used cloning methods which transplant the fairly well - mapped adjacent regions into the zoa .",
    "both procedures are unsatisfactory , because inhomogeneous data coverage will introduce non - existing flow fields .",
    "the derived results on the apex of the lg motion , as well as the distance at which convergence is attained , still are controversial .",
    "kolatt et  al .",
    "@xcite , for instance , have shown that the mass distribution within the inner @xmath26 of the zoa  as derived from theoretical reconstructions of the density field ( see sect .",
    "[ recon ] )  is crucial to the derivation of the gravitational acceleration of the lg : the direction of the motion measured within a volume of 6000  kms@xmath20  will change by @xmath27 when the ( reconstructed ) mass within the zoa is included .",
    "care should therefore be taken on how to extrapolate the galaxy density field across the zoa .",
    "obviously , a reliable consensus on the galaxy distribution in the zoa is important to minimize these uncertainties .      in this context , not only the identification of unknown and suspected clusters , filaments and voids are relevant , but also the detection of nearby smaller entities .",
    "the peculiar velocity of the lg , @xmath28 , is proportional to the net gravity field @xmath29 , which can be determined by summing up the masses @xmath30 of the individual galaxies at their distances @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the density parameter and @xmath34 the bias parameter .",
    "the gravity field as well as the light flux of a galaxy decreases with @xmath35 . the direction and amplitude of the peculiar velocity therefore",
    "is directly related to the sum of the _ apparent magnitudes _ of the galaxies in the sky through @xmath36 for a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this has important implications and suggests , for instance , that the galaxy cen a with an absorption - corrected magnitude of @xmath37 exerts a stronger luminosity - indicated gravitational attraction on the local group than the whole virgo cluster .",
    "however , in this context , the question whether the mass - to - light ratio is constant , i.e. no biasing occurs , is doubtful , a problem inherent to all cumulative dipole determinations .",
    "these calculations also predict that the 8 apparently brightest galaxies  which are all nearby ( @xmath38  kms@xmath20 )  are responsible for 20% of the total dipole as determined from optically known galaxies within @xmath39  kms@xmath20 .",
    "hence , a major part of the peculiar motion of the lg is generated by a few average , but nearby galaxies .    in this sense",
    ", the detection of other nearby galaxies hidden by the obscuration of the galaxy can be as important as the detection of entire clusters at larger distances .",
    "the expectation of finding additional nearby galaxies in the zoa is not unrealistic .",
    "six of the nine apparently brightest galaxies are located in the zoa : ic342 , maffei 1 and 2 , ngc4945 , cena and the recently discovered galaxy dwingeloo 1 ( see sect .  [ dogs ] ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of an unknown andromeda - like galaxy behind the milky way would have implications for the internal dynamics of the lg , the mass determination of the lg , and the present density of the universe from timing arguments @xcite .",
    "density enhancements locally decelerate the uniform expansion field , as has been observed within our own local supercluster .",
    "vice versa , systematic streaming motions over and above the uniform expansion field usually indicate mass overdensities ( accelerations ) or voids ( decelerations ) . knowing ( a ) the observed recessional velocity @xmath40 of a galaxy through its redshift @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the rest wavelength , and @xmath44 is the observed wavelength , and ( b ) a redshift - independent distance estimate @xmath45 , the peculiar motion of a galaxy @xmath46 due to the underlying mass density field can be determined : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the recession velocity a galaxy would have in an unperturbed expansion field ( @xmath49 ) . in this manner , the mass density field can be determined independent of the galaxy distribution and/or an assumption on the mass - to - light ratio .    based on these considerations , dressler et  al .",
    "@xcite identified a systematic infall pattern from peculiar velocities of about 400 elliptical galaxies which was interpreted as being due to a hypothetical great attractor with a mass of @xmath50 , at a position in redshift space of @xmath51  kms@xmath20 ) @xcite . a more recent study by kolatt et  al .",
    "@xcite , based on a larger data set ( elliptical _ and _ spiral galaxies ) and the potential reconstruction method potent ( see sect .  [ recon ] and fig .",
    "[ kolatt ] ) place the center of the ga right behind the milky way .",
    "recent consensus is that the ga is an extended region ( @xmath52 ) of moderately enhanced galaxy density centered behind the galactic plane .",
    "although there is a considerable excess of optical galaxies and iras - selected galaxies in this region ( see fig .",
    "[ ait ] and fig .",
    "[ btp ] ) , no dominant cluster or central peak can been seen . however , a major part of the ga is hidden by the milky way .",
    "various large - scale structures are ` bisected ' by the milky way . what is their true extent ?",
    "these large - scale structures , their sizes , and the distribution of the various galaxy types within these structures , carry information on the conditions and formation processes of the early universe , providing important constraints which must be reproduced in cosmological models .",
    "it is therefore valuable to fully outline these superclusters across the zoa .",
    "it is curious , that the two major superclusters in the local universe , i.e. perseus - pisces and the great attractor overdensity , lie at similar distances on opposite sides of the lg , and that both are partially obscured by the zoa .",
    "it is therefore of particular interest to map these structures in detail , determine their extent and masses , in order to find out which one of the two is dominant in the tug - of - war on the local group .      for all of the above reasons ,",
    "the unveiling of galaxies behind the milky way has turned into a research field of its own in the last ten years . in the following ,",
    "i discuss all the various observational multi - wavelength techniques that are currently being employed to uncover the galaxy distribution in the zoa such as deep optical searches , far - infrared and near - infrared surveys , systematic blind radio surveys and searches for hidden massive x - ray clusters .",
    "i will describe the different limitations and selection effects inherent to each method and present results obtained with these various methods  describing the results and discoveries in detail for the great attractor region .",
    "predictions from reconstructions of the density field in the zoa are also presented and compared with observational evidence .",
    "the comparison between reconstructed density fields and the observed galaxy distribution are important as they allow derivations of the density and biasing parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "systematic optical galaxy catalogs are generally limited to the largest galaxies ( typically with diameters @xmath53 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these catalogs become , however , increasingly incomplete for galaxies the closer they are to the galactic plane . with the thickening of the dust layer , the absorption increases and",
    "reduces the brightness of the galaxies and their ` visible ' extension .",
    "obviously such galaxies are not intrinsically faint ; they only appear faint because of the dimming by the dust .",
    "systematical deeper searches for partially obscured galaxies  down to fainter magnitudes and smaller dimensions compared to existing catalogs  have been performed on sky surveys with the aim of reducing this zoa .",
    "one of the first attempts to detect galaxies in the zoa was carried out by bhm - vitense in 1956 @xcite .",
    "she did follow - up observations in selected fields in the gp in which shane & wirtanen @xcite found objects that `` looked like extragalactic nebulae '' but were not believed to be galaxies because they were so close to the dust equator .",
    "she confirmed many galaxies and concluded that the obscuring matter in the plane must be extremely thin and full of holes between @xmath54-@xmath55 .    because extinction was known to be low in puppis , fitzgerald @xcite performed a galaxy search on a field there ( @xmath56 ) and discovered 18 small and faint galaxies .",
    "two years later , dodd & brand @xcite examined 3 fields adjacent to this area ( @xmath57 ) and detected another 29 galaxies .",
    "kraan - korteweg & huchtmeier @xcite observed these galaxies at radio wavelengths with the 100  m radio telescope at effelsberg in germany .",
    "this method was chosen because extinction is unimportant at these long wavelengths and the neutral gas of spiral galaxies can easily be observed at 21  cm ( see sect .",
    "[ hi ] ) . with these observations ,",
    "a previously unknown nearby cluster at ( @xmath58  kms@xmath20 ) could be identified .",
    "adding far - infrared data ( see sect .",
    "[ fir ] ) , it was shown that this puppis cluster is comparable to the virgo cluster and that it contributes a significant component to the peculiar motion of the lg @xcite . during a search for infrared objects",
    "weinberger et  al .",
    "@xcite , detected two galaxy candidates near the galactic plane ( @xmath59 ) which huchra et  al .",
    "@xcite confirmed in 1977 to be the brightest members of a galaxy cluster at 4200  kms@xmath20 .",
    "this discovery led weinberger @xcite to start the first _",
    "systematic _ galaxy search . using the red prints of the palomar sky survey , he covered the whole northern gp ( @xmath60-@xmath61 ) in a thin strip @xmath62 .",
    "he found 207 galaxies , the distribution of which is highly irregular : large areas disclose no galaxies , the `` hole '' pointed out by bhm - vitense was verified , but most conspicuous was a huge excess of galaxies around @xmath63-@xmath64 . in 1984 , focardi et  al .",
    "@xcite made the connection with large - scale structures : they interpreted the excess as the possible continuation of the perseus - pisces cluster [ pp ] across the plane to the cluster a569 .",
    "radio - redshift measurements by hauschildt @xcite established that the pp cluster at a mean redshift of @xmath65  kms@xmath20  extends to the cluster 3c129 in the gp ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "additional hi  and optical redshift measurements of zwicky galaxies by chamaraux et  al .",
    "@xcite indicate that this chain can be followed even further to the a569 cloud at @xmath67  kms@xmath20  on the other side of the zoa .",
    "these early searches proved that large - scale structure can be traced to very low galactic latitudes despite the foreground obscuration and its patchy nature which shows clumpiness and clustering in the galaxy distribution independent of large - scale structure .",
    "the above investigations did confirm suspected large - scale features across the plane through searches in selected regions and follow - up redshift observations . to study large - scale structure , systematically broader latitude strips covering the whole milky way , respectively the whole zoa ( see fig .",
    "[ ait ] ) are required .",
    "using existing sky surveys such as the first and second generation palomar observatory sky surveys poss i and poss ii in the north , and the eso / src ( united kingdom science research council ) southern sky atlas , various groups have performed systematic deep searches for `` partially obscured '' galaxies .",
    "they catalogued galaxies down to fainter magnitudes and smaller dimensions ( @xmath68 ) than previous catalogs . here ,",
    "examination by eye remains the best technique .",
    "a separation of galaxy and star images can as yet not be done on a viable basis below @xmath69-@xmath70 by automated measuring machines such as e.g. cosmos @xcite or apm @xcite and sophisticated extraction algorithms , nor with the application of artificial neural networks .",
    "thus , although surveys by eye clearly are both very trying and time consuming  and maybe not as objective  they currently still provide the best technique to identify partially obscured galaxies in crowded star fields .    meanwhile , through the efforts of various collaborations , nearly the whole zoa has been surveyed and over 50000 previously unknown galaxies could be discovered in this way .",

    "the contour level of @xmath95 , for instance , is nearly indistinguishable from the galaxy density contour at 0.5 galaxies per square degree .    at intermediate extinction levels ( between the outer and second extinction contour @xmath96 ) , distinct under- and overdensities",

    "this is mainly due to the foreground obscuration .",
    "a3627 is hardly discernable in , for instance , the distribution of lauberts galaxies : the observed diameters of the galaxies in this density peak are just _ below _ the lauberts diameter limit ( due to the obscuration ) .",
    "this cluster is _ not evident _ in the far infrared ( see sect .  [ fir ] ) .",
    "this can be explained by the predominance of early - type galaxies ( 50% in the core of this cluster , 25% within its abell radius ) which do not radiate in the far infrared but are a clear signature of rich clusters .",

    "the galaxies at these extinction levels are not intrinsically faint .",
    "they must in fact be intrinsically very bright galaxies to still be visible through the murk of the milky way .",
    "the obscuration effects on the parameters of galaxies have been studied in detail by cameron @xcite who simulated the effects of absorption on the brightness profiles of various virgo galaxies .",

    "analazing the galaxy density as a function of the galaxy size , magnitude and/or morphology in combination with the foreground extinction has led to the identification of various important large - scale structures in the zoa and their approximate distances .",

    "the success and status of these approaches are discussed in the following sections .",
    "in 1983 , the infrared astronomical satellite iras surveyed 96% of the whole sky in the far infrared bands at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  @xmath172 , resulting in a catalog of 250000 point sources , i.e. the iras point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the latter has been used extensively to quantify extragalactic large - scale structures .",
    "the identification of the galaxies from the iras data base is quite different compared to the optical : only the fluxes at the 4 far infrared ( fir ) iras passbands are available but no images .",
    "the identification of galaxies is strictly based on the relation of the fluxes .",
    "for instance , yamada et  al . @xcite",
    "used the criteria : * 1 . *",
    "@xmath173jy , * 2 . * @xmath174 , * 3 . * @xmath175 , to select galaxy candidates from the iras psc .    with these flux and color criteria",
    "mainly normal spiral galaxies and starburst galaxies are identified .",
    "hardly any dwarf galaxies enter the iras galaxy sample , nor the dustless elliptical galaxies , as they do not radiate in the far infrared .",
    "the upper cut - off in the third criterion is imposed to minimize the contamination with cool cirrus sources and young stellar object within our galaxy .",
    "this , however , also makes the iras surveys less complete for nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using iras data for large - scale structure studies is its homogeneous sky coverage ( all data from one instrument ) and the negligible effect of the extinction on the flux at these long wavelengths .",
    "even so , it remains difficult to probe the inner part of the zoa with iras data because of cirrus , high source counts of galactic objects in the galaxy , and confusion with these objects  most of them have the same iras characteristics as external galaxies .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining unambiguous galaxy identifications at these latitudes was demonstrated by lu et  al .",
    "@xcite , who found that the detection rate of iras galaxy candidates decreases strongly as a function of galactic latitude ( from @xmath176 to @xmath177 ) .",
    "this can only be explained by the increase in faulty iras galaxy identifications .",
    "yamada et  al .",
    "@xcite also found a dramatic and unrealistic increase in possible galaxies close to the galactic plane in their systematic iras galaxy survey of the southern milky way ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "so , despite the various advantages given with iras data , the sky coverage in which reliable iras galaxy identifications can be made ( 84% ) provides only a slight improvement over optical galaxy catalogs ( compare e.g. the light - grey mask in fig .",
    "[ btp ] with the optical zoa - contour as displayed in fig .",
    "[ ait ] ) .",
    "in addition to that , the density enhancements are very weak in iras galaxy samples because ( a ) the iras luminosity function is very broad , which results in a more diluted distribution since a larger fraction of distant galaxies will enter a flux - limited sample compared to an optical galaxy sample , and ( b ) iras is insensitive to elliptical galaxies , which reside mainly in galaxy clusters , and mark the peaks in the mass density distribution of the universe .",
    "this is quite apparent in a comparison of the iras galaxy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ btp ] ) with the optical galaxy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ ait ] and fig .",

    "nevertheless , dedicated searches for large - scale clustering within the whole zoa ( @xmath178 ) have been made by various japanese collaborations ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "they used iras color criteria to select galaxy candidates which were subsequently verified through visual examination on sky surveys , such as the poss of the northern hemisphere and the eso / src for the southern sky . because of their verification procedure , this data - set suffers , however , from the same limitations in highly obscured regions as optical surveys .",
    "based on redshift follow - ups of these zoa iras galaxy samples , they established various filamentary features and connections across the zoa .",
    "most coincide with the structures uncovered in optical work . in the northern milky way both crossings of the perseus - pisces arms into the zoa are very prominent  considerably stronger in the fir than at optical wavelengths",
    " and they furthermore identified a new structure : the cygnus - lyra filament at ( @xmath179kms@xmath20 ) . across the southern milky way they confirmed the three general concentrations of galaxies around puppis ( @xmath180 ) , the hydra - antlia extension ( @xmath181 , @xcite ) and the centauraus wall ( @xmath182 )",

    "the comparison of the real galaxy distribution @xmath333 ( * r * ) , from e.g.  complete redshift surveys , with the peculiar velocity field * v*(*r * ) will lead to an estimate of the density and biasing parameter ( @xmath334 ) through the equation @xmath335 cf .",

    ", they have been quite successful in pinpointing a number of important features :    @xmath337 scharf et  al .",
    "@xcite applied spherical harmonics to the 2-dimensional iras psc and noted a prominent cluster behind the zoa in puppis ( @xmath56 ) which was simultaneously discovered as a nearby cluster through hi - observations of obscured galaxies in that region by kraan - korteweg & huchtmeier @xcite .",
    "@xmath337 hoffman @xcite predicted the vela supercluster at ( @xmath338  kms@xmath20 ) using 3-dimensional wf reconstructions on the iras 1.9 jy redshift catalog @xcite , which was observationally discovered just a bit earlier by kraan - korteweg & woudt @xcite .",

    "[ kolatt ] ) . shortly thereafter , kraan - korteweg et  al .",
    "@xcite unveiled the cluster a3627 as being very rich and massive and at the correct distance .",
    "it hence is the most likely candidate for the central density peak of the ga .",
    "recent reconstructions have been applied to denser galaxy samples covering larger volumes ( @xmath340  kms@xmath20 ) with smoothing scales of the order of 500  kms@xmath20  ( compared to 1200  kms@xmath20 in the earlier reconstructions ) .",
    "it therefore seemed of interest to see whether these reconstructions find evidence for unknown major galaxy structures at higher redshifts .",
    "the currently most densely - sampled , well - defined galaxy redshift catalog is the optical redshift survey @xcite . however , this catalog is limited to @xmath341 and the reconstructions @xcite within the zoa are strongly influenced by 1.2  jy iras redshift survey data and a mock galaxy distribution in the inner zoa .",
    "i therefore concentrate on reconstructions based on the 1.2  jy iras redshift survey only . in the following , the structures identified in the zoa by ( a ) webster et  al .",
    "@xcite using wf plus spherical harmonics and linear theory and ( b ) bistolas @xcite who applied a wf plus linear theory and non - constrained realizations on the 1.2  jy iras redshift survey are discussed and compared to observational data .",

    "@xcite identified nearby cluster at ( @xmath342 , @xmath343-@xmath70 , 1500  kms@xmath20 ) , whereas bistolas reveals no clustering in the region of the local void out to 4000  kms@xmath20 . at the same longitudes ,",
    "clustering is indicated at 7500  kms@xmath20  by bistolas , but not by webster et  al .",
    "the perseus - pisces chain is strong in both reconstructions , and the 2nd perseus - pisces arm  which folds back at @xmath344  is clearly confirmed .",
    "both reconstructions find the perseus - pisces complex to be very extended in space , i.e.  from 3500  kms@xmath20  out to 9000  kms@xmath20 . whereas the ga region is more prominent compared to perseus - pisces in the webster et  al .",
    "reconstructions , the signal of the perseus - pisces complex is considerably stronger than the ga in bistolas , where it does not even reveal a well - defined central density peak . both reconstructions find no evidence for the suspected pks1343 cluster but its signal could be hidden in the central ( a3627 ) density peak due to the smoothing . while the cygnus - lyra complex ( @xmath345-@xmath346  kms@xmath20 ) discovered by takata et  al .",
    "@xcite stands out clearly in bistolas , it is not evident in webster et  al .",
    "both reconstructions find a strong signal for the vela supercluster ( @xmath347  kms@xmath20 ) identified by kraan - korteweg & woudt @xcite and hoffman @xcite . the cen - crux cluster identified by woudt @xciteis evident in bistolas though less distinct in webster et  al .",

    "2 in @xcite  is supported by both methods .",
    "the ophiuchus cluster @xcite just becomes visible in the most distant reconstruction shells ( 8000  kms@xmath20 ) .",
    "not all reconstructions find the same features , and when they do , the prominence of the density peaks as well as their locations in space do vary considerably . at velocities of @xmath349",
    "kms@xmath20  most of the dominant structures lie close to the zoa while at larger distances , clusters and voids seem to be more homogeneously distributed over the whole sky . out to 8000",
    "kms@xmath20 , none of the reconstructions predict any major structures which are not mapped or suggested from observational data .",
    "so , no major surprises seem to remain hidden in the zoa .",
    "the various multi - wavelength explorations of the milky way will soon be able to verify this .",
    "still , the combination of both the reconstructed potential fields and the observationally mapped galaxy distribution will lead to estimates of the cosmological parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in the last decade , enormous progress has been made in unveiling the extragalactic sky behind the milky way . at optical wavebands ,",
    "the entire zoa has been systematically surveyed .",
    "it has been shown that these surveys are complete for galaxies larger than @xmath350 ( corrected for absorption ) down to extinction levels of @xmath170 . combining these data with previous `` whole - sky '' maps results in a reduction of the `` optical zoa '' of a factor of about 2 - 2.5 which allow an improved understanding of the velocity flow fields and the total gravitational attraction on the local group .",
    "various previously unknown structures in the nearby universe could be mapped in this way .    at higher extinction levels , other windows to the zoa become more efficient in tracing the large - scale structures .",
    "very promising in this respect are the current near - infrared surveys which find galaxies down to latitudes of @xmath351 and systematic hi  surveys which detect gas - rich spiral galaxies all the way across the galactic plane  hampered slightly only at very low latitudes ( @xmath352 ) because of the numerous continuum sources .",
    "the `` behind the plane '' survey resulted in a reduction from 16% to 7% of the `` fir zoa '' and new indications of possible hidden massive clusters behind the milky way are now forthcoming from the ciza project ",
    "although again an `` x - ray zoa '' will remain due to the absorption of x - ray radiation by the thickening gas layer close to the galactic plane .",
    "a difficult task is still awaiting us , i.e. to obtain a detailed understanding of the selection effects inherent to the various methods in order to merge the different data sets in a uniform , well - defined way .",
    "this is extremely important if we want to use this data for quantitative cosmography .",
    "moreover , we need a better understanding of the obscurational effects on the observed properties of galaxies identified through the dust layer ( at all wavelengths ) , in addition to an accurate high - resolution , well - calibrated map of the galactic extinction .    despite the fact that our knowledge of the above questions is as yet limited , a lot can and has been learned from zoa research .",
    "this is evident , for instance , from the detailed and varied investigations of the great attractor region .",
    "mapping the ga and understanding the from peculiar velocity fields inferred massive overdensity had remained an enigma due the fact that the major and central part of this extended density enhancement is largely hidden by the obscuring veil of the milky way .",
    "does light trace mass in this region and where is the rich cluster which biasing predicts at the center of large - scale potential wells ?",
    "the results from the various zoa surveys now clearly imply that the great attractor is , in fact , a nearby `` great - wall '' like supercluster , starting at the nearby pavo cluster below the gp , moving across the massive galaxy cluster a3627 toward the shallow overdensity in vela at 6000  kms@xmath20 .",
    "the cluster a3627 is the dominant central component of this structure , similar to the coma cluster in the ( northern ) great wall .",
    "whether a second massive cluster around pks1343@xmath129601 is part of the core of the ga remains uncertain .",

    "<S> i present the various observational multi - wavelength procedures ( optical , far infrared , near infrared , radio and x - ray ) that are currently being pursued to map the galaxy distribution behind our milky way , including a discussion of the ( different ) limitations and selection effects of these ( partly ) complementary approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the newly unveiled large - scale structures are discussed and compared to predictions from theoretical reconstructions of the mass density field . </S>",
    "<S> particular emphasis is given to discoveries in the great attractor region  a from streaming motions predicted huge overdensity centered behind the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> the recently unveiled massive rich cluster a3627 seems to constitute the previously unidentified core of the great attractor . </S>"
