    "massive early - type galaxies in the local universe have long been known to show surprisingly tight scaling relations such as faber - jackson relation @xcite , or more generally , fundamental plane @xcite , as well as red sequence @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that early - type galaxies are a fairly homogeneous population and they are thought to form in an intense starburst in their initial phase , followed by passive evolution .",
    "the seminal work of the galactic - wind model by @xcite is among the first successful theoretical attempts to reproduce the observed properties of early - type galaxies in the local universe such as the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "this simple picture of early - type galaxy formation is supported by the observation that the single - burst passive evolution model is able to reproduce the observed location of the red sequence even in @xmath6 clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed absorption line studies of nearby early - type galaxies lends a further support .",
    "alpha elements are primarily released in type - ii supernova explosions , which occur on a short time scale . on the other hand ,",
    "iron - peaked elements are primarily produced by type - ia supernovae , which are thought to occur with a delay time of @xmath7 gyr .",
    "the observed [ @xmath8/fe ] enhancement at high mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) is often interpreted as massive galaxies being formed on a fairly short time scale at high redshifts @xcite so that type - ia supernovae do not significantly contribute to the overall metal enrichment , although [ @xmath8/fe ] is also sensitive to imf .",
    "this picture nicely fits within the framework of a top - down galaxy formation scenario .",
    "however , the widely accepted @xmath9cdm cosmology naturally predicts bottom - up galaxy formation .",
    "this bottom - up scenario might appear to confront with the simple observational picture above , but @xcite presented a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation built upon the millennium simulation @xcite and showed that the hierarchical model can reproduce the observed old stellar population of massive early - type galaxies today . in their model , galaxies do assemble hierarchically , but most stars that are in massive galaxies at @xmath10 formed early and the stellar population is thus old .",
    "an extreme example of this hierarchical assembly presented by @xcite is that the most massive galaxies today has acquired 80% of their mass below redshift of unity .",
    "deep imaging observations of nearby elliptical galaxies often unveil tidal features around them , which support the picture of growing early - type galaxies at low redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we are starting to understand the galaxy formation in the hierarchical universe , but theoretical models in this context still do not fully reproduce the observed mass growth of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the massive galaxy formation still remains one of the major issues .",
    "recent advent of sensitive near - ir spectrographs on large aperture telescopes has opened a new window in this area .",
    "imaging observations have shown that many of the massive galaxies in the field at @xmath11 are actively forming stars , but quiescent galaxies do exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "deep near - ir spectroscopy of these quiescent galaxies has revealed their evolved stellar populations .",
    "@xcite performed near - ir spectroscopy of @xmath11 galaxies in order to probe their rest - frame optical light and showed that roughly half of the galaxies they observed have suppressed star formation .",
    "ultradeep spectroscopy of a @xmath11 galaxy by @xcite showed a pronounced 4000  break .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also presented deep near - ir spectroscopy , and recently , x - shooter has started producing high - quality spectra of @xmath12 galaxies with clear detections of absorption features ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the number of such spectra is fast growing .",
    "so far , most of the work on @xmath11 massive galaxies are based on data in blank fields and the nature of massive cluster galaxies remains unclear .",
    "but , high-@xmath13 clusters are an interesting site to study the formation of massive ellipticals given the prominent red sequence in local clusters .",
    "also , they will provide a key to understanding the origin of the environmental dependence of galaxy properties observed at low redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dedicated effort has identified a number of high redshift groups and clusters of galaxies at @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among them , a @xmath15 group , which is likely a progenitor of a today s massive cluster , is carefully studied by @xcite and they showed that the group already exhibits a prominent red sequence of quiescent early - type galaxies formed at @xmath16 ( ssp - equivalent ) .",
    "this adds further evidence that at least a fraction of today s massive cluster ellipticals passively evolve since an early epoch .",
    "higher redshift galaxies have stronger constraining power on their own formation process , and in this paper , we focus on a forming cluster at @xmath0 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for recent work on a @xmath17 cluster .",
    "pks1138 - 26 is a powerful radio galaxy located at @xmath0 and it has been intensively studied by many authors , providing robust evidence for a forming cluster @xcite .",
    "a wealth of imaging data as well as a large number of spectroscopic redshifts are available in this field , making it an unique place to investigate the question raised above .",
    "we present deep near - ir spectroscopy of galaxies in this proto - cluster and study galaxy populations in detail with an emphasis on the formation of massive cluster ellipticals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we summarize the data used in this work in section 2 .",
    "we perform sed fitting using spectroscopic and photometric data in this paper and the procedure is described in section 3 , followed by the results from the sed fitting in section 4 .",
    "we discuss the nature of star forming members by stacking their spectra in section 5 .",
    "we then turn our attention to massive quiescent members and perform spectral analyses to constrain the stellar population and formation time scale of these massive galaxies using a stacked spectrum in section 6 .",
    "we summarize and discuss the implications of our findings in section 7 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a flat universe with @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "a deep multi - wavelength data set is available in the field of the radio galaxy pks1138 at @xmath0 .",
    "the field has been imaged with lris on keck ( @xmath21-band ; @xcite ) , fors on vlt ( @xmath22 and @xmath13 ) , acs on hst ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; @xcite ) , moircs on subaru ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; @xcite ) , sofi on ntt ( @xmath27 ; @xcite ) , and irac on spitzer ( @xmath28 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we base our analysis on an updated version of the multi - band catalog presented in @xcite .",
    "we primarily used mag_auto from source extractor @xcite in the original catalog , but this resulted in somewhat erroneous photometry particularly for faint objects .",
    "we instead smooth all the images to the worst seeing of 1.2 arcsec and perform aperture photometry in dual image mode to derive colors .",
    "all the objects are selected in the unsmoothed @xmath26-band .",
    "aperture correction is derived by comparing mag_auto and aperture magnitudes in the @xmath26 band and has been applied to all the other bands .",
    "we used moircs on the subaru telescope @xcite to perform a near - ir follow - up spectroscopy of the galaxies in pks1138 .",
    "the targets for spectroscopy were selected by photometric redshifts ( @xmath29 hereafter ) in @xcite .",
    "we first applied a @xmath26-band magnitude cut of @xmath30 to ensure that we do not observe spurious objects .",
    "galaxies that are consistent with being at the cluster redshift within @xmath31 were selected as primary targets for spectroscopy .",
    "we further gave a priority to red objects in the @xmath32 color because their @xmath29 are likely more precise and we are particularly interested in constraining the formation history of the oldest , most massive cluster galaxies . in areas of the moircs field with no suitable targets ( about 10% of the field of view ) , we filled the mask with random objects , which in the end serve as a good control sample to estimate our redshift accuracy .",
    "we targeted 38 objects in total , of which 34 are photo-@xmath13 selected galaxies . among them , 13 have a red color with @xmath33 .",
    "only this one mask was observed in our run .",
    "the observations were carried out on the 4th and 8th feb .",
    "the conditions were photometric and seeing was good ( 0.6 - 0.8 arcsec ) on both nights .",
    "we used @xmath34 slits with the zj500 grism , which provides a wavelength coverage of 0.9 - 1.7@xmath35 with a resolving power of @xmath36 .",
    "the data reduction was performed in a standard manner using the custom - designed code described in @xcite .",
    "after the dark subtraction , the frames were cut into individual slits and flat - fielding was performed .",
    "we measured relative spatial offsets between the exposures using a bright star in the mask .",
    "as most of the objects were not readily visible in each exposure , we first stacked all the exposures to measure a trace of an object .",
    "we then extracted objects in each exposure using that trace shifted by the spatial offsets measured off the bright star .",
    "finally , the extracted spectra were combined with weights computed with the flux of the bright star , which effectively accounted for both seeing and atmospheric transparency variations .",
    "the wavelength was calibrated against the sky lines and the flux was calibrated against a0v stars .",
    "telluric absorptions were corrected for in each exposure using a bright star observed in the same mask .",
    "we note that the spectral fluxes are not calibrated in the absolute sense at this point due to the slit loss .",
    "the total science integration time amounted to 6.8 hours .    among 38 objects that we observed ,",
    "we were able to extract spectra for 30 of them and we have visually inspected all of them .",
    "even with the long integration on an 8 m telescope , a typical s / n of the spectra is too low ( @xmath37 per resolution element ) to directly measure redshifts via absorption features .",
    "seven objects show multiple emission lines and their redshifts can be derived .",
    "five objects show only a single emission line and the line is not uniquely identified .",
    "such a line is probably a strong line such as @xmath38 , @xmath39 or h@xmath40 .",
    "we choose the most probable line among them using spectrophotometric redshifts measured in section 3 .",
    "we can not measure secure redshifts for the rest of the objects .",
    "we present a list of measured redshifts in table [ tab : spec_sample ] along with spectroscopic redshifts from the literature where available @xcite . note that our redshift for id=537 is inconsistent with the literature redshift , but our redshift is not a secure redshift .",
    "the spectra with measured redshifts ( both secure and possible redshifts ) are presented in appendix .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : spec_sample ]",
    "as mentioned in the last section , a large fraction of the moircs spectra is not of sufficient quality to measure redshifts using absorption features . as a result",
    ", we can not determine precise redshifts for quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , we can still determine fairly accurate redshifts as well as physical properties of these galaxies using continuum features in the spectra such as the 4000@xmath3 break when combined with the broad - band photometry .",
    "this technique has been demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we measure an inverse - variance weighted mean flux of the observed spectra in 300@xmath41 bins starting from 0.9@xmath35 to 1.7@xmath35 .",
    "the observed spectra are not flux - calibrated in the absolute sense due to the slit loss .",
    "we compute the slit loss by comparing the broad - band @xmath25 and @xmath27-band photometry with the photometry synthesized with the observed spectra .",
    "we take the average of the slit loss in the @xmath25 and @xmath27-band for most objects . for a small number of objects ,",
    "either @xmath25 or @xmath27-band is not fully covered in the spectra due to the slit positions , and we use either one of the bands to compute the slit loss .",
    "a typical amount of the slit loss is about 40% .",
    "we follow the standard procedure for the sed fitting .",
    "we use an updated version of the @xcite code , which includes an improved treatment of thermally pulsating agb stars , to generate model templates of galaxies .",
    "we assume the chabrier initial mass function and solar metallicity .",
    "we adopt the @xmath42-model for star formation histories of galaxies with @xmath42 allowed to vary between 0 and infinity .",
    "dust extinction is applied to the templates assuming the calzetti attenuation curve @xcite .",
    "emission lines are added to the spectra using the emission line intensity ratios given in @xcite assuming the @xcite attenuation law .",
    "each template is convolved with the response functions of all the filters ( including the atmosphere for ground - based facilities ) . for the binned spectra",
    ", we use a top - hat function to synthesize fluxes .",
    "the observed seds are fit with the model templates using the standard @xmath43 minimization technique .",
    "we apply a template error function in order to reduce systematics between the model templates and real seds of galaxies and also to assign uncertainties to the model templates as a function of rest - frame wavelength .",
    "we use the same template error function as in @xcite ( for details , refer to the appendix b of that paper ) .",
    "the model templates have 4 free parameters : redshift , star formation time scale ( @xmath42 ) , extinction ( @xmath44 ) , and age .",
    "stellar mass and sfr can be computed from the combination of redshift , @xmath42 , and age .",
    "the @xmath43 fits thus produce multi - parameter probability space . in this probability space ,",
    "each parameters are marginalized over all the other parameters and we use the median of the probability distribution as the central value and quote 68% interval around it as an uncertainty .",
    "our estimates of the physical parameters thus properly include uncertainties in redshift .",
    "as mentioned above , we bin the spectra into @xmath45 . from a statistics point of view",
    ", one does not necessarily have to bin the spectra .",
    "fitting the unbinned spectra together with the broad - band photometry may be more straightforward .",
    "we find that , in our case , fits to unbinned spectra often result in catastrophic outliers in redshift with unrealistically small uncertainties .",
    "we suspect that this likely comes from non - gaussian nature of the noise property of our spectra .",
    "our spectral resolution is very low and sky emission lines often overlap each other in near - ir .",
    "it is not surprising if we have under / over subtracted the sky lines , which would introduce non - gaussianity in the noise characteristics of the spectra .",
    "a flux calibration error and small offsets in object traces used for the 1d extraction , especially at the edges of the covered wavelength range , are also sources of systematics . to reduce the systematic errors",
    ", we bin the spectra by clipping outliers in each bin . to be specific , we clip top 10% and bottom 10% distribution of the fluxes in each bin and use the rest to compute the weighted average .",
    "this binning at the same time loses wavelength resolution .",
    "we would like to keep the resolution , while having the bin size wide enough to reduce the systematics .",
    "our bin size is a compromise between them .",
    "we have confirmed that our results do not significantly change if we change the bin size by a factor of 1.5 ( i.e. , @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) .",
    "we denote photometric redshifts based on broad - band data only as @xmath29 and those based on both broad - band photometry and binned spectra as @xmath48 in what follows .",
    "@xcite suggested to use the term photometric redshifts for those based on photometry with a spectral resolution of @xmath49 .",
    "our binned spectra have a higher resolution and we use the term @xmath48 just to distinguish it from @xmath29 .",
    "it will be instructive to compare redshifts and physical parameters estimated with and without the binned spectra and we briefly summarize how the binned spectra improve them in appendix .",
    "we have performed the sed fitting using the broad - band photometry and the binned spectra for all of the objects for which we are able to extract the spectra .",
    "we first investigate how accurate our spectro - photometric redshifts ( @xmath48 ) are and then move on to discuss detailed physical properties of the galaxies in the proto - cluster .",
    "[ fig : specz_vs_specphotoz ] compares @xmath50 and @xmath48 . in general , the agreement between them is fairly good , except for agns .",
    "this is not surprising because we did not include agn templates in the sed fitting .",
    "if we do so , @xmath48 for normal galaxies tends to degrade and we choose not to include agn templates .",
    "we measure the accuracy of @xmath48 to be @xmath51 .",
    "this may not appear as good as one might expect , but this accuracy is for faint galaxies with @xmath52 , while photo-@xmath13 accuracies quoted in the literature often include much brighter galaxies .    fig .",
    "[ fig : zhist ] presents @xmath48 distribution of all the objects we observed .",
    "a half of the observed galaxies are clustered around the cluster redshift of @xmath0 .",
    "this is particularly clear in the full @xmath53 distribution and a sharp peak is observed at the cluster redshift .",
    "the peak is partly due to the fact that we pre - selected member candidates using @xmath29 , but the @xmath54 range in @xmath29 used for the target selection is typically @xmath55 which is wider than the redshift spike observed here .",
    "this likely represents a large - scale structure and/or galaxy concentration at the cluster redshift .",
    "we define a proto - cluster membership candidate using the photo-@xmath13 probability distribution function ( pdf ) . to be specific",
    ", we apply the following criterion :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the proto - cluster redshift of @xmath58 and @xmath53 is the photo-@xmath13 pdf .",
    "note that we take the redshift of the radio galaxy @xcite as the proto - cluster redshift here .",
    "our @xmath48 has @xmath51 as noted above and we adopt the @xmath59 range to integrate the pdf .",
    "if the integrated probability exceeds 0.16 , we define the galaxy as a member candidate .",
    "this probability threshold is arbitrary , but if a galaxy is consistent with being at @xmath60 within @xmath61 , it is a candidate for group membership . given the limited accuracy of our @xmath48 , we expect some contamination of near - foreground / background galaxies .",
    "we will estimate the amount of such contamination later .",
    "most objects at @xmath62 satisfies @xmath63 and they are the subject of this work . however , there are three objects that have @xmath63 but with spec-@xmath13 s inconsistent with being cluster members ( id113 , 280 , and 435 ) .",
    "we exclude them from the following analysis .",
    "there are two agns with spec-@xmath13 s consistent with the cluster members , but we fail to obtain consistent @xmath48 due probably to the agn contamination to the overall seds ( id=537 and 559 ) .",
    "we could fit these objects with redshifts fixed to their spectroscopic redshifts to derive their physical properties , but the agn contribution would still affect the measurement of sfr and stellar mass .",
    "we do not examine these galaxies either .",
    "this leaves us with 11 member candidates .      among the 11 member candidates we have selected ,",

    "our spectral analysis is performed in the rest - frame optical wavelengths , where these unstable stars do not significantly contribute .",

    "direct , precise metallicity measurements of our proto - cluster galaxies will be essential , but we note that , even if we assume ( somewhat unrealistic ) super - solar metallicity with @xmath134 , a short formation time scale ( @xmath135 gyr ) is still required to reproduce the observed red spectrum . for sub - solar metallicity ,",
    "the time scale becomes even shorter .",
    "we have summarized a number of sources of systematics above and we argue that our results do not significantly suffer from most of them . the only major concern is the uncertainty in the overall spectral evolution of the models in the optical at ages of a few gyr , which is difficult to quantify at this point .",
    "we should bear it in mind , but it is unlikely that the inferred short formation time scale changes by as much as @xmath7 gyr , which is needed to bring the observation consistent with recent simulations as discussed below .",

    "detailed spectral analyses based on the stellar population synthesis models suggest that the quiescent galaxies form at @xmath132 with a formation time scale of @xmath4 gyr .",
    "this short formation time scale is consistent with what has been indicated by stellar absorption studies of massive ellipticals in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the observed @xmath8 element enhancement suggests that their major episode of star formation has to be short so that type ia supernovae do not significantly contribute to the overall metal enrichment .",
    "the exact delay time of type ia supernovae is still uncertain , but eq .",
    "4 of @xcite gives a star formation time scale of 0.4 gyr for a @xmath137 galaxy , which is consistent with our finding .",
    "one of the main criticisms of this interpretation is that it is possible to attribute the @xmath8-enhancement to an imf variation .",
    "but , our observation at @xmath11 presented in this paper provides independent evidence for the rapid formation .",
    "@xcite performed sph simulations of massive galaxy formation in the cosmological context .",
    "they show that most star formation happens at high redshifts , while a significant mass assembly happens at later times , @xmath138 .",
    "this nicely reproduces the observation that the stellar populations of massive early - type galaxies today are old .",
    "however , the overall star formation time scale of the massive galaxies ( @xmath139 ) in @xcite is @xmath140 gyr , which is longer than the time scale inferred from our observations .",
    "@xcite extended the work by including stellar feedback , but the star formation time scale seems to remain similar ( see their fig .",

    "they studied objects that become isolated massive galaxies today , while we have focused on a forming galaxy group .",

    "our observation sets the upper limit on the formation time scale .",
    "the lower limit comes from the observed solar [ fe / h ] abundance in nearby massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    ", the star formation should not be instantaneous .",
    "closed - box models have provided a way to link metallicity and star formation time scales , but a detailed chemo - hydrodynamic simulation in the cosmological context would be needed to derive a more useful lower limit .",
    "after the intensive in - situ star formation , subsequent star formation has to be shut off in order to reproduce the red spectra of the observed quiescent galaxies without prominent emission lines .",
    "theoretical work has suggested a role of agns for such quenching @xcite .",

    "this is a total sfr of all galaxies that end up in a massive galaxy at @xmath10 , and thus sfrs of individual galaxies at @xmath2 should be lower .",
    "this may indicate a tension between observation and simulation or perhaps it just means that only a fraction of massive galaxies experience a submm phase ( and hence not fully reproduced by simulations of a dozen galaxies ) .",
    "we should also mention that the simulated galaxies in @xcite tend to be less massive than observed submm galaxies and the comparison here may not be fair .",
