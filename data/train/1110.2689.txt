    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are mass - exchanging binary stars in which a white dwarf primary accretes material from a late main - sequence secondary .",
    "the systems represent an important stage in the life cycle of binary stars undergoing common envelope evolution . of specific relevance to the investigations presented in this paper",
    "is the fact that cvs also provide the setting for some of the most observationally accessible accretion disc - driven outflows in the universe , since the binary systems are relatively bright and have short ( @xmath1 hours ) orbital periods .",
    "outflows in the form of winds with velocities of @xmath31000 km s@xmath4 are evident in almost all high accretion rate cvs , and particularly nova - like and dwarf novae in outburst .    empirical properties of the high - speed , high - ionization cv winds have been established very effectively from uv line transitions accessible to the _ iue _ , _ hst _ and _ fuse _ space borne observatories ( see e.g heap et al .",

    "; knigge , woods & drew 1995 ) . the observational transition between blueshifted absorption and p  cygni profiles in low inclination ( face - on ) cvs to broad emission dominated uv lines in more",
    "edge - on systems has been interpreted as evidence for the bipolarity of the outflows ( e.g. drew 1987 ) .",
    "it is clear however that the morphologies of the uv lines can not be assumed to be independent of orbital phase or temporal changes .",
    "time - series _ hst _ uv and _ fuse _ fuv spectroscopic datasets have revealed extensive variability in the uv resonance lines on @xmath1 hourly time - scales ( e.g. baptista et al . 1995 ; prinja et al . 2000 ; hartley et al .",
    "2002 ; prinja et al .",
    "2003 ; froning 2005 ) . the ( f)uv time - series studies have revealed an enigmatic variety of characteristics . several low inclination systems exhibit orbitally modulated , blue - shifted wind features for which the origin of the departure in axisymmetry remains unclear .",
    "a few nova - like cvs reveal erratic episodic features that accelerate rapidly across the absorption line profiles ; others in contrast have mostly steady wind - formed uv lines .",
    "additional uncertainties concern the origin of thermal emission that produces substantial emission components in cvs viewed at low inclination .",
    "the origin and driving of fast outflows in high - state cvs also remains uncertain , primarily as the effective radiation force in low ( e.g. proga , stone & drew , 1997 ) .",
    "though magnetic fields and thermal expansion have been considered as mechanisms for potentially driving the disc winds , line - driven models are currently the more fully developed in the context of bipolar cv winds , and in the hydrodynamic and magneto - hydrodynamic limits ( see e.g. proga 2005 ) .",
    "proga , stone & drew ( 1997 ) also highlighted the potentially unsteady nature of the line - driven disc winds , with the consequent rise due to instabilities of ( stochastic ) rapidly evolving ( over several minutes ) clumps of gas ; however in contrast the hydrodynamical models of pereyra , kallman & blondin ( 1997 ) indicate more stable outflows .",
    "theoretical predictions of unsteady disc outflows are interesting in the context of the rapid _ fuse _ fuv spectroscopy presented here .",
    "we present here a study of the nova - like system v3885 sgr , based on highly time - resolved _ fuse _ datasets .",
    "we aim to investigate systematic changes in the uv lines and bipolar disc wind on orbital and rapid ( @xmath1 few minutes ) time - scales .",
    "we examine whether orbital - related changes are present and examine causal connections to an axi - symmetry of the entire bipolar outflow .",
    "the alternative of a non - wind departure of symmetry due to line - emitting hots spots or disc residing structures is also investigated .",
    "v3885 sgr is a bright , non - eclipsing cv ( e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "the recent studies of ribeiro & diaz ( 2007 ) and linnell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have provided firm values for the orbital , disc and binary parameters .",
    "some adopted values are listed in table 1 .    .v3885",
    "sgr adopted system parameters . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we explore here whether tomography can offer any constraints on the line formation regions of the variable fuv absorption in v3885 sgr .",
    "we add the caveat that the line formation of the fuv resonance lines is likely to be complex due to contributions from multiple physical sources such as the disc , disc@xmath2stream interaction , and the outflow .",
    "two dimensional images of v3885 sgr were calculated using a back - projection tomography code ( e.g. richards 2004 ) .",
    "since the observed siv doublet profiles are dominated by absorption , the tomograms were made from difference profiles by subtracting the mean spectrum for each epoch ( obs1 , obs2 ) from each respective observed spectrum .",
    "the coverage afforded by our _ fuse _ time - series is reasonably complete in phase except for phases 0.3@xmath20.4 and 0.6@xmath20.7 ( e.g. fig .",
    "7 ) , and high resolution spectra collected around the orbit of the binary are required to produce a good image .",
    "tomograms were calculated from siv @xmath51063 , 1073 spectra collected during observing runs on 2000 may 24 ( obs1 ) and 2003 sep .",
    "21/22 ( obs2 ) .",
    "the parameters of v3885 sgr adopted for the calculation are listed in table 2 .",
    "the doppler maps based on the siv difference spectra are shown in fig .",
    "10 and reveal the line emission regions in doppler coordinates ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) , where low velocity patterns correspond to the inner regions of the images , and high velocity parts of the inner disc are mapped to the outer portions of the tomograms .",
    "the tomograms reveal closely corresponding structures for the separate @xmath81063 ( blue ) and @xmath81073 ( red ) components of the siv doublet , although the absorption features in the blue difference spectra were typically weaker than in the red spectra .",
    "there are similarities between the tomograms derived at the two epochs , which is expected since the orbital modulation is present at both epochs ( e.g. fig .",
    ". however , some clear differences are evident .",
    "for example , the intense emission source seen in obs1 near the velocity of the mass donor ( at @xmath6 @xmath1 0 to 100 km s@xmath4 and @xmath7 @xmath1 200 to 500 km s@xmath4 ) is significantly reduced in obs2 ( see fig .",
    "10 ) . during obs2 ,",
    "the most intense emission arose from two regions on opposing sides of the accretion disc around the white dwarf with @xmath6 velocities of @xmath2250 to @xmath2700 km / s and + 300 to 700 km / s .",
    "the blueshifted region is close to where the gas stream would interact with the accretion disc , and the redshifted part can be viewed half an orbit away , as emission from the stream - disk impact region moving away from us .",
    "11 shows the comparison between the siv tomograms and the h@xmath0 tomograms from hartley et al .",
    "the main difference between the images results from the incomplete phase coverage for the siv data .",
    "however , the most intense parts of the siv tomograms overlap with the brightest parts of the accretion disc identified in the h@xmath0 tomograms",
    ". the regions of overlap are illustrated by the dashed areas on the image in the right frame of fig .",
    "the trailed spectrograms of the siv lines display an s - wave pattern suggesting that a complete data set might produce a more disk - like image as seen in the h@xmath0 tomogram .",
    "we have analysed the fuv absorption line characteristics of the nova - like cv v3885 sgr .",
    "_ fuse _ satellite spectra secured in ttag mode were extracted in 100 sec bins to provide intensive time - series datasets comprising of 126 spectra in 2000 may and 155 spectra in 2003 september . _ all _ the well developed absorption lines in the _ fuse _ range are tightly modulated on the system orbital period of @xmath1 0.207 days .",
    "the ttag data additionally reveal very rapid ( @xmath1 5 to 10 mins ) fluctuations in the absorption lines , which are indicative of stochastic density changes .",
    "we have calculated the first fuv doppler tomograms of v3885 sgr and highlight a variable line - emitting source where the gas stream from the secondary interacts with the accretion disc .",
    "the fuv lines are on average blueshifted thus suggesting a disc outflow is also present ( see e.g. fig . 2 and _ hst _ data of hartley et al .",
    "2002 ) .        the orbital phase dependent behaviour of the fuv lines is summarised in fig .",
    "12 where we show phased - binned siv doublet profiles compared to the mean profile , for the dataset of 2000 may ( obs1 ) .",
    "the variable line profile morphology is illustrated clearly .",
    "the absorption is narrower and deeper at the most redward velocities ( phase @xmath1 0.75 ) , and the absorption is shallower when most blueshifted ( phase @xmath1 0.25 ) .",
    "the orbital phase - dependent changes in line velocity and optical depth are in concert for a very wide range of ion species , including low ions such as ly@xmath0 , ciii , niii and high ionization lines of pv and ovi .",
    "this correspondence suggests that the fuv lines have the same physical origin or that the material generating them is coherent enough to supply low and high ionization regions .",
    "the monte carlo based radiative transfer models of long & knigge ( 2002 ) predict the thermal and ionization structures of disc winds in cvs .",
    "the disc and wind models , with plausible mass accretion rates , provide simulations that can successfully reproduce multiple lines in high state systems .",
    "the models can match the general cases where civ and nv are observed as well developed p  cygni profiles , and lower ion lines such as ciii and niii appear in absorption only .",
    "more problematic for the line - driven disc wind model is the origin of the axisymmetry that results in orbital modulation of all the wind - formed lines .",
    "time - resolved _ fuse _ spectroscopy of other non - eclipsing nova - like cvs has also revealed modulation on the orbital period ( e.g. rw sex , prinja et al .",
    "2003 ; v592 cas , prinja et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the case of v3885 sgr presented here",
    "it is difficult to imagine a scenario where the orbital - phase modulations in uv lines are entirely to due an asymmetry that has a wind - only origin .",
    "there is no clear mechanism for shifting the velocities of the entire bipolar outflow that arises in the inner disc by several 100 km s@xmath4 in a cyclic manner on the orbital period .",
    "we propose that it is more plausible that the orbital behaviour of the fuv lines in v3885 sgr is due to interaction(s ) between the disc and the mass accreting stream from the donor secondary .",
    "a disc - stream interaction region , such as line emitting hot spot , may be highlighted in the doppler tomography presented in sect .",
    "4 . also revealing in this context are the line depth changes as a function of velocity and orbital phase ( figs . 8 and 12 ) .",
    "we interpret that a relatively steady component of the blueshifted absorption lines arises from a slow ( few 100 km s@xmath4 ) disc wind in v3885 sgr .",
    "the source of the orbital changes in the lines may then be due to a disc - residing emission - line hot spot .",
    "we draw some parallels here with the study of long et al .",
    "( 2009 ) of the dwarf nova vw hyi in quiescence .",
    "long et al .",
    "propose that significant emission in the _ fuse _ range may arise due to a 25,000 k hot spot where the material from the secondary encounters the disc . in the context of v3885 sgr , at phase @xmath1 0.25 the emission source due to a hot spot has a maximum positive velocity ( @xmath1 150 km s@xmath4 , see e.g. fig .",
    "the superposition of this emission component on an ` underlying ' disk wind absorption has the effect of ` filling in ' the very low to rest velocity regions of the absorption trough , while the high velocity absorption ( @xmath3 @xmath2200 km s@xmath4 ) is relatively unaffected .",
    "in contrast at phase @xmath1 0.75 the emission due to a hot spot has maximum blueward velocity , and thus the high velocity absorption is now affected , while the absorption depth of the lowest velocity regions of the profile remains comparatively high ( e.g. fig .",
    "we attempted a simple illustration of this scenario by adopting a gaussian profile ( fwhm = 300 km s@xmath4 ; peak flux above continuum = 1.5 ) to crudely represent the emission component from a localised disc - stream interaction region , such as a hot spot .",
    "the gaussian profile velocity was shifted as a function of orbital phase with a semi - amplitude of @xmath9 150 km s@xmath4 ( phase = 0 corresponds to red to blue crossing , and maximum redward and blueward velocities occur at phases 0.25 and 0.75 , respectively ) .",
    "the product of the emission profile and the mean siv @xmath81063 profile observed in obs1 was then used to form a short ` time - series ' .",
    "the line profiles generated essentially approximate a steady low velocity outflow with a superimposed disc residing emission source .",
    "the phase - dependent behaviour of the emission line source is shown in fig . 13 . though we have simply assumed a fixed emission strength and width ( see counter evidence in sect .",
    "3.1 ) , the grey - scale image in fig .",
    "13 nevertheless reproduces the empirical result that the redward absorption between @xmath1 0 and 300 km s@xmath4 is weaker at phase @xmath1 0.25 and more enhanced at phase @xmath1 0.75 ( cf .",
    "figs . 7 and 8) .",
    "a more accurate reproduction of the behaviour observed in v3885 sgr would require ad - hoc reduction of the blueward emission line strength at phase @xmath1 0.75 .",
    "ultimately it would be necessary to examine the line formation and dynamics of a localised disc residing emission source that in effect acts as the lower boundary to the ` overlying ' disc wind in v3885 sgr .",
    "we conclude meanwhile that the orbital phase behaviour of fuv absorption lines in v3885 sgr is not due to an asymmetry in the disc wind .",
    "the line profile variability more likely betrays a line emission source associated with a localised region where gas from the secondary interacts with the accretion disc .",
    "0.25 compared to phase @xmath1 0.75 . ]",
    "we have analysed the variability characteristics of _ fuse _ ( ttag ) time - series spectra of the non - eclipsing , nova - like system v3885 sgr .",
    "the data were secured over two epochs in 2000 and 2003 .",
    "our key results are :    \\(i ) the low ( ciii ) , intermediate ( siv ) and high ( pv , ovi ) ionization lines vary in a tightly corresponding manner , on time - scales of a fraction of the system orbital period ( @xmath1 0.21 days ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the line profile variability is predominantly orbital - phase modulated , with a s - wave velocity motion of the observed absorption troughs over a range of @xmath1 @xmath2200 km s@xmath4 to + 200 km s@xmath4 .",
    "\\(iii ) for phase = 0 corresponding to the + ve to @xmath2ve crossing of the spectral lines , the maximum blueward velocity occurs at phase @xmath1 0.25 and the maximum redward displacement is at @xmath1 0.75 .",
    "\\(iv ) in addition to the orbital modulations , stochastic line profile changes are evident on time - scale down to @xmath1 3 minutes .",
    "we associate these events with instabilities in the accretion stream or disc wind .",
    "\\(v ) we have derived the first fuv tomograms of v3385 sgr , to complement previously published tomography based on optical spectra . with the caveat that the fuv lines likely arise from multiple line formation regions , we find evidence in the tomograms for structures forming where the gas stream interacts with the accretion disc .",
    "\\(vi ) we favour a scenario where localised disc - stream interaction generates a line - emitting source , and thus provides the dominant axisymmetry for orbital modulated fuv line profile behaviour in v3885 sgr .",
