    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies are an intriguing subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; boroson & green 1992 ) , consistent on average with having lower black hole masses and higher mass accretion rates compared with typical seyfert 1s .",
    "they typically have steep 2 - 10  kev spectra ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) , and even steeper spectra at lower energies forming a prominent soft x - ray excess below @xmath0 2 kev ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; leighly 1999 ; boroson 2002 ) .",
    "gallo ( 2006 ) proposed that nls1s could be split into two types .",
    "there are ` complex ' nls1s which show deep dips in their x - ray light curves , during which their hard x - ray spectra become harder and contain strong features around the fe k@xmath2 line , and ` simple ' nls1s which do not show these features .",
    "so far the most robust agn quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) detection is also in the ` simple ' nls1 re j1034 + 396 ( gierliski et al .",
    "2008 ; alston et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "while there is general consensus that the high energy 2 - 10  kev emission in agn is from the compton up - scattering by high temperature , optically thin electrons in a corona , the origin of the soft x - ray excess is less clear .",
    "there are two main models proposed for this , namely the highly relativistically smeared , partially ionised reflection model ( e.g. miniutti & fabian 2004 ; ross & fabian 2005 ; fabian & miniutti 2005 ; crummy et al 2006 ) , and the low temperature , optically thick comptonisation model ( laor et al . 1997 ; magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ; gierliski & done 2004 ; mehdipour et al 2011 ; done et al .",
    "both models can fit the spectra equally well over the classic 0.3 - 10  kev x - ray bandpass , and both require some fine - tuning of parameters : comptonisation models all give very similar temperatures ( czerny et al .",
    "2003 ; gierliski & done 2004 ; porquet et al .",
    "2004 ) while reflection models give similar ionisation states ( done & nayakshin 2007 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the models can be separated with variability or higher energy data .",
    "noda et al .",
    "( 2011 ) use the fast variability in the broad line seyfert 1 ( bls1 ) mkn 509 to show that on the shortest timescales there is a constant component in the spectrum which has a shape compatible with thermal comptonisation and not with reflection .",
    "similarly , including high energy data shows that a thermal comptonisation component is better than reflection in terms of fitting the soft x - ray excess in bls1s ( boissay et al .",
    "2014 ; matt et al . 2014 ; mehdipour et al .",
    "lohfink et al .",
    "( 2016 ) similarly find the soft x - ray excess in the bls1 fairall 9 is dominated by an additional component ( though they model it with a very steep power law rather than thermal comptonisation ) .",
    "they also require some additional relativistically smeared reflection , but this disappears when more physical models are used to describe the narrow torus reflection component in these data ( yaqoob et al .",
    "thus in bls1s there is mounting evidence that the soft x - ray excess is an additional thermal comptonisation component .",
    "however , in nls1s the situation is more open .",
    "the key observation is that the new spectral - timing techniques reveal a soft lag in the data , consistent with the reflection geometry as reflected photons have longer light paths than those from the hot corona .",
    "this predicts a reverberation time - lag for the reflected emission which depends on the height of the corona and the black hole mass ( fabian et al .",
    "2009 ; zoghbi et al . 2010 ; zoghbi & fabian 2011 ; zoghbi , uttley & fabian 2011 ; kara et al .",
    "2013a , b , c ; fabian et al . 2013",
    "; uttley et al .",
    "2014 ; fabian et al . 2014 ; chiang et al .",
    "while the reflected spectrum is dominated by the iron line in the 6 - 7  kev bandpass , this reverberation lag is as strong or stronger at soft energies for partially ionised reflection , and current instruments have so much more effective area below 2  kev that this is much easier to detect as a soft lag than as an iron line lag ( though the latter h@xmath3as also been seen : de marco et al .",
    "2013 ; kara et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "however , the reflection - dominated model often requires extreme parameters , with the x - ray source being very close to the event horizon of a high spin black hole .",
    "this is inconsistent with the lag - frequency spectra seen from these objects , as these are actually dominated by a soft lead at low frequencies , which only switches to the reverberation soft lag for the fastest variability timescales ( e.g. alston , done & vaughan 2014 ; jin , done & ward 2016 ) . a soft lead on timescales",
    "much longer than the soft lags requires that the hard x - rays respond to changes in the soft x - ray flux on timescales which are longer than the light travel time between the two regions .",
    "these longer lags are generally interpreted as propagation , where fluctuations in the accretion flow propagate down to progressively smaller radii which emit harder spectra ( e.g. lyubarskii 1997 ; kotov , churazov & gilfanov 2001 ) .",
    "this is most naturally produced in a radially stratified flow , which requires that a large fraction of the soft x - ray excess is intrinsically produced in the flow rather than being reflected ( but see chainakun & young 2016 for an alternative dual lamppost model ) .",
    "thus it seems most likely that in nls1s there is a mix of both intrinsic ( soft leads ) and reprocessed ( soft lags ) emission making up the soft x - ray excess .",
    "gardner & done ( 2014 ) do a full spectral - timing model and find that they can model the lag - frequency spectrum in the ` simple ' nls1 pg 1244 + 026 by a model where fluctuations in the thermal comptonisation inner disc region propagate down to the high energy corona .",
    "the high energy x - rays reflect from the same inner disc , producing a small , moderately ( not extremely ) smeared reflection component .",
    "this is not sufficient to produce the observed soft lag , but many of the illuminating photons are not reflected , so instead are absorbed in the disc .",
    "these should thermalise , producing a ( quasi ) blackbody soft component which reverberates with the harder x - rays , producing the observed lag .",
    "this model can also be generalised to fit the much shorter observed soft lag of a few tens of seconds seen in the ` complex ' nls1s if much of the extreme variability is associated with occultation events ( gardner & done 2015 ) .",
    "both ` simple ' and ` complex ' nls1s may well be accreting at super - eddington rates ( done & jin 2016 ) , in which case the occultations can easily be explained as arising from the clumpy disc wind which should be produced at such mass accretion rates ( ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ; jiang et al .",
    "2014 ; takeuchi et al . 2014 ; hagino et al . 2016",
    "; done & jin 2016 ) .",
    "this also provides a way to unify the ` simple ' and ` complex ' nls1s if the differences in their x - ray spectra and variability are caused by differences in the viewing angle relative to the clumpy wind .",
    "we note that complex absorption has long been suggested as the origin of the extreme iron features associated with the ` complex ' nls1s ( turner et al . 2007 ;",
    "miller et al . 2007 ; sim et al . 2010 ; tatum et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the number of nls1s which are bright enough and/or have long enough observations to allow a detailed spectral - timing analysis is very limited . here",
    "we present the analysis of a recent 133 ks  observation of another ` simple ' nls1 , namely .",
    "this source is a relatively nearby , type-1 narrow - line quasi - stellar object ( qso ) ( @xmath4 , thomas et al . 1998 ) , with a galactic gas column density of @xmath5 @xmath6 ( kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) and no significant intrinsic extinction ( grupe et al . 2010 ) , indicating a very clear line of sight .",
    "the h@xmath7 fwhm of  was found to be only @xmath8  km  s@xmath9 , which is the narrowest among all the 110 soft x - ray selected agn in grupe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( also see bian & zhao 2004 ) .",
    "based on the _ swift _ observation , grupe et al .",
    "( 2010 ) report a soft x - ray slope of @xmath02.2 , a single - epoch black hole mass of @xmath10 m@xmath11 and an extreme eddington ratio of 12.9 which is derived from the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "therefore ,  has a very similar x - ray spectral shape to the ` simple ' nls1s such as pg 1244 + 026 and re j1034 + 396 , but with an even more extreme mass accretion rate , potential more comparable to 1h 0707 - 495 ( done & jin 2016 ) .",
    "the study of this source allows us to further understand the soft excess mechanism in these unobscured , highly accreting agn , and to identify additional ubiquitous properties among these sources .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "firstly we describe the latest  observation of  and our data reduction procedures .",
    "then we present the source s variability properties in section 3 .",
    "a detailed spectral timing modelling is present in section 4 , in order to separate the various components and to understand their origins . in section 5",
    "we report results from our x - ray inter - band coherence and covariance analysis .",
    "the inter - band time - lag analysis is present in section 5 .",
    "discussion of the soft x - ray excess and its potential connection with the region of inner disc which we claim is puffed up , is given in section 7 .",
    "finally , section 8 summaries the main results of this work .",
    "we adopt a flat universe model for the luminosity distance with the hubble constant h@xmath12 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "( jansen et al . 2001 ) observed  on 2016 - 02 - 12 for a continuous duration of 133 ks ( pi : c. jin ) .",
    "all three european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) ( pn , mos1 , mos2 ) were operated in the _ imaging _ data - mode , with the epic - pn camera in the _ primelargewindow _ mode with the _ thick _ filter , and the two mos cameras in the _ primepartialw3 _ mode with the _ thin _ filter .",
    "the two reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) cameras were both in the _ spectroscopy _ data - mode .",

    "imaging+fast _ data - mode with exposures in six optical / uv filters ( v , b , u , uvw1 , uvm2 , uvw2 ) .",
    "we followed the standard procedures of using the sas software ( v15.0.0 ) and the latest calibration files to reduce the data .",
    "the epproc and emproc tasks were used to reprocess the epic data and create the event files .",
    "the rgsproc and omfchain tasks were used to reprocess the rgs and om data . for the epic data",
    ", we defined a source extraction region of 80 arcsec centred at the position of , and extracted background from a nearby region of the same size without any point source contamination . by checking the background light curve above 12 kev",
    ", we found that this observation is almost free from high background flares except for some short periods at the beginning and end of the exposure . as a result we excluded all contaminated data from the first 4 ks and last 8 ks using the tabgtigen task .",
    "the filtered observation has a continuous 121 ks duration with 113 ks exposure in epic - pn ( 94.9% live time ) and 120 ks exposure in mos1 and mos2 ( 99.5% live time ) .",
    "the background subtracted mean source count rates are 2.01 counts per second ( cps ) , 0.64 cps and 0.61 cps in epic - pn , mos1 and mos2 , respectively , which are all well below the pile - up threshold for the chosen observing mode and filter .",
    "we further checked that there is no photon pile - up in any of the three epic cameras by running the epatplot task .",
    "in the subsequent analysis , we only adopted good events ( flag=0 ) with pattern @xmath15 4 for epic - pn ( i.e. single and double patterns ) and pattern @xmath15 12 for mos1 and mos2 ( i.e. single , double , triple , quadruple patterns ) .",
    "the epic light curves and spectra were extracted from the source and background regions separately using the evselect task .",
    "these regions were chosen to avoid the ccd area where the copper instrumental background is high ( freyberg et al .",
    "the epiclccorr task was used to perform the background subtraction and _ absolute _ corrections on the source light curves for various instrumental factors .",
    "the rmgfen , arfgen and backscale tasks were used to create response and auxiliary files and to calculate the scaling factor .",
    "the rgs spectra were extracted using the rgsproc task .",
    "all the epic and rgs spectra were grouped with at least 20 counts per bin using the grppha tool ( ftools v6.19 ) .",
    "spectral fittings were performed using the xspec ( v12.9.0u ) package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "variability studies can provide crucial information concerning the mechanism of the soft x - ray emission and to help break the degeneracy of spectral components .",
    "this clean and uninterrupted 120 ks  observation of  reveals the characteristics of its energy - dependent variability in great detail .",
    "we first compared the light curves extracted from the 0.3 - 1 , 1 - 2 and 2 - 10 kev bands . after applying all the filtering , correction and background subtraction ( see section  [ sec - obs ] ) , the intrinsic source variability can be visualised in these light curves .",
    "fig.[fig - lc ] shows that  exhibits strong variability in all three x - ray bands .",
    "the count rate varies by @xmath1650% over tens of ks . for timescales of ks and shorter ,",
    "the 2 - 10 kev band shows a factor of 2 variability , while the 0.3 - 1 kev band is more stable on these short timescales .",
    "this is confirmed by the intrinsic fractional root - mean - square ( rms ) variability ( edelson et al . 2002 ; markowitz , edelson & vaughan 2003 ; vaughan et al . 2003 ) , which is @xmath17% , @xmath18% , @xmath19% for the 0.3 - 1 , 1 - 2 and 2 - 10 kev bands , respectively .",
    "a psd quantifies the variability power in different frequency bands .",
    "we first combined light curves from all three epic cameras to maximise the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) using the lcmath tool ( ftools v6.19 ) , and then calculated the psd from the combined light curve using the powspec tool .",
    "the normalisation of powspec was chosen to be -2 , which allowed it to produce a white noise subtracted psd , the integration of which gives the excess variance .",
    "the resultant psds are binned with a geometrical step of 1.4 and plotted in fig.[fig - powspec ] .",
    "these psds show significant variability across a wide frequency band ( @xmath20 hz ) covered by the  observation , extending from the soft up to the hard x - rays .",
    "there is no detection of periodic signals , which is not surprising as qpos in agn are very rare , and not always easy to detect even when present ( middleton et al .",
    "2009 ; alston et al .",
    "2014 )    for the high frequency band of @xmath21 hz , the hard x - rays show stronger rms variability than seen in the soft x - rays .",
    "this is also observed in several other nls1s of high mass accretion rates ( e.g. pg 1244 + 026 , jin et al .",
    "2013 ; re j1034 + 396 , middleton et al . 2009 ; ark 564 , m@xmath22hardy et al . 2007 ) .",
    "there is a high frequency rollover in the 0.3 - 1 kev band psd ( fig.[fig - powspec]a )",
    ". a broken power law fit to the psd indicates a best - fit break frequency of @xmath23 hz ( 1 @xmath24 confidence level , red dashed line in fig.[fig - powspec]a ) . assuming a power law form of @xmath25",
    ", we find @xmath26 ( the 90% confidence range is [ -1.81 , -1.19 ] ) and @xmath27 below and above the break frequency .",
    "this indicates a similar psd shape to some other nls1s such as ark 564 around the high frequency break ( m@xmath22hardy et al .",
    "if the slope below the break frequency is fixed at -1 , we find @xmath28 hz ( blue solid line in fig.[fig - powspec]a ) which is slightly lower than in the previous fit , with @xmath29 which is consistent with the previous value .",
    "the s / n of psds of the higher energy bands is not sufficient to provide strong constraints on the broken power law model .",
    "the x - ray variability not only has an energy dependence , but also has a clear frequency dependence as already seen in the psd .",
    "this can be revealed directly by the frequency - dependent rms spectra ( arvalo et al .",
    "2008 ; middleton et al . 2009",
    "; jin et al . 2013 , here after : j13 ) .",
    "we adopted the prescription in arvalo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to calculate the frequency - dependent rms from the psd in every energy bin , and used the equations given in poutanen , zdziarski & ibragimov ( 2008 ) to calculate the error . to reduce the number of zero - count bins in the light curve , which would otherwise bias the rms , we combined light curves from all three epic cameras and chose a binning time of 400 s. with careful division of energy bins , all the light curves below 4 kev have @xmath31 zero - count bins out of 305 bins ( i.e. @xmath32 2% ) , while the 4 - 6 kev light curve has 9 zero - count bins ( 3% ) and 6 - 8 kev light curve has 70 zero - count bins ( 23% ) .",
    "the light curve above 8 kev has more than 50% zero / negative - count bins after background subtraction , so we did not use it in the timing analysis .",
    "each light curve has bins of 400 s and 120 ks long , which corresponds to a frequency range of @xmath33 hz . since the psds in fig.[fig - powspec ]",
    "show the soft x - rays have smaller rms than the hard x - rays above @xmath34 hz , we chose to divide the frequency range into two sub - ranges at @xmath34 hz , and refer to @xmath35 hz as the high frequency ( hf ) band and @xmath36 hz as the low frequency ( lf ) band .",
    "similar to other ` simple ' nls1s such as rx j0136.9 - 3510 ( jin et al .",
    "2009 ) , re j1034 + 396 ( middleton et al . 2009 ) , pg 1244 + 026 ( j13 ) and rx j1140.1 - 0307 ( jin , done & ward 2016 ) , the hf rms of  increases steeply from soft to hard x - rays , suggesting a strong dilution to the hf variability in the soft excess ( fig.[fig - rms ] ) .",
    "the lf rms spectrum shows strong variability across the entire x - ray band with no obvious trend , which is different from pg 1244 + 026 where the lf rms was strongly suppressed in the hard x - ray band ( j13 ) , and also different from re j1034 + 396 where the lf rms is small across the entire x - ray band ( middleton et al .",
    "these rms spectra imply that there must be at least two major x - ray components with different variability behaviours dominating the soft and hard x - ray bands separately , which we will model in the next section ."
