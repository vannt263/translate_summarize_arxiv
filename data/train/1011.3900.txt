    "for example , the kalman filter @xcite was developed at a time when significant efforts were underway in aerospace engineering in the early 1960 s .",
    "the kalman filter is the solution of a filtering problem based on a statistical model involving gaussian stochastic processes and linear dynamics ( statistical filtering dates back to kolmogorov @xcite and wiener @xcite ) .",

    "progress in quantum filtering has been slow , due to both conceptual and practical experimental issues concerning the measurement of quantum systems .",
    "however , significant advances were made in the field of quantum optics , a field of study concerned with quantum properties of light and the interaction of light and matter . in quantum optics ,",
    "thanks to the invention of the laser and other experimental developments , quantum effects became accessible and a sophisticated theory of open systems , measurement theory , and quantum noise emerged .",
    "in particular , we mention the quantum filtering results due to belavkin @xcite , @xcite that extend the thinking behind the above - mentioned classical filtering theory ( belavkin was a student of stratonovich in the 1960 s ) .",
    "belavkin employed quantum stochastic methods that were developed in the 1980 s to describe quantum noise and a quantum generalization of the it calculus , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the principle algebraic distinctions between the boson and fermion cases are the commutation and anticommutation relations satisfied by these fields ( which underly the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics ) , and the need to take parity into account in the fermion case .    in an effort to be as concrete as possible , in this paper we develop the filtering theory using a model with just enough generality to solve filtering problems for two examples .",

    "we mention that for an _ odd _ adapted process @xmath379 and a fermion field @xmath380 , @xmath381 we have the anti - commutation relations @xmath382",
    "the laws of quantum physics dictate that fermionic operators from independent systems must _ anticommute _ with one another .",
    "that is , if @xmath383 is any fermionic operator on a system @xmath384 with hilbert space @xmath385 for @xmath386 then we must have @xmath387 . realizing this property is not trivial",
    "because typically when one has a composite system with hilbert space @xmath388 ( here @xmath389 , depending on the context , denotes the tensor product between two hilbert spaces or the tensor product between two hilbert space operators ) the operator @xmath390 , originally defined only on @xmath391 , would be identified with its ampliation @xmath392 on the composite hilbert space , whereas @xmath393 would be identified with @xmath394 .",
    "this is problematic for fermionic systems since then we would have that @xmath395 , which is not necessarily @xmath42 for arbitrary fermionic operators @xmath390 and @xmath393 . to resolve this issue and get these operators to anticommute correctly ,",
    "the hilbert spaces of fermionic systems are endowed with some additional structure and the usual tensor product between operators must be replaced with the antisymmetric tensor product between operators .",
    "we briefly explain this below , for a more detailed account see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be the hilbert space of a fermionic system .",
    "then it is required that there exists an orthogonal decomposition @xmath396 where the subspace @xmath397 is called the _ even subspace _ , while @xmath398 is called the _ odd subspace_. an operator @xmath23 on @xmath19 is said to be even if it leaves the even and odd subspaces invariant @xmath399 and odd if it maps vectors of the even subspace into the odd subspace and vice - versa @xmath400 .",
    "in particular the fermionic operators ( or degrees of freedoms ) are odd operators .",
    "let @xmath401 and @xmath402 denote the orthogonal projection onto the odd and even subspace , respectively .",
    "define the linear",
    "_ parity operator _ @xmath403 and the linear _ parity superoperator _",
    "@xmath404 for any bounded operator @xmath23 on @xmath19 .",
    "it is easily checked from the definition that @xmath405 and @xmath224 have the following properties :      note that properties @xmath410 to @xmath411 imply that @xmath224 is an automorphism on @xmath412 ( the space of all bounded operators on @xmath19 ) .",
    "for an operator @xmath23 with definite parity ( i.e. , it is either even or odd ) we define the binary - value parity functional @xmath413 as @xmath414 if @xmath23 is even and @xmath415 if @xmath23 is odd . thus for any operator with a definite parity we have that @xmath416 . in general an operator",
    "@xmath23 has a decomposition into odd part and even parts as @xmath417 , where @xmath418 and @xmath419 are even and odd operators , respectively , given by : @xmath420 thus @xmath421    we can now define the composition of independent fermionic systems @xmath422 and @xmath423 . the composite system has hilbert space @xmath424 and parity operator @xmath425 so that its even and odd subspaces are @xmath426 and @xmath427 . the key question is how to ampliate the action of operators @xmath428 acting on the individual hilbert spaces @xmath429 to the composite hilbert space , so as to satisfy the desired fermionic anti - commutation relations . for this",
    "we define the antisymmetric tensor product @xmath430 between @xmath390 and @xmath393 as @xmath431 the ampliation of an operator @xmath432 of the first system is @xmath433 , and the ampliation of an operator @xmath434 of the second system is @xmath435 , such that @xmath436 .",
    "in particular if both @xmath390 and @xmath393 are odd then @xmath437 ( the ampliations anticommute ) , while if at least one of them is even then @xmath438=0 $ ] ( the ampliations commute ) .",
    "note that the ampliation preserves the original parities of the system operators , e.g. @xmath439 .",
    "now , if @xmath440 is a third fermionic system we can show that @xmath441 so that the antisymmetric tensor product is associative and @xmath442 is unambigously defined . by repeating the above procedure we can define the composition of an arbitrary number of systems @xmath443 , @xmath444 such that @xmath445 is well defined for arbitrary operators @xmath383 on @xmath446 . for simplicity",
    "we identify each @xmath383 with its ampliation to @xmath447 with respect to the antisymmetric tensor product @xmath430 , so that if @xmath448 then @xmath449 whenever both @xmath383 and @xmath450 are odd , while @xmath451=0 $ ] whenever one of them is even .    in the setting of this paper , we also consider composite systems consisting of fermionic and non - fermionic ( bosonic ) sub - systems .",
    "the composition can be described in the framework of the anti - symmetric tensor product by endowing the non - fermionic systems with a _ trivial _ parity structure . indeed according to quantum physics , bosonic operators from one system commute with all operators ( even or not ) from the other systems , so they can be interpreted as `` even '' operators .",
    "this can be achieved by defining the parity operator of a bosonic system as @xmath452 ( i .. e . , take @xmath453 and @xmath454 ) so that @xmath455 for all bosonic operators .",
    "in this way we can extend the definition of @xmath430 _ mutatis mutandis _ to mixtures of fermionic and non - fermionic systems in the way we had done above for fermionic systems .",
    "for instance , let @xmath391 and @xmath456 be the hilbert spaces of two non - fermionic systems and @xmath457 is the hilbert space of a fermionic system .",
    "consider the composite system on @xmath458 and let @xmath383 be an operator on @xmath385 .",
    "then we have that @xmath459 .",
    "similary , for the composite system on @xmath460 we have @xmath461 .",
    "that is , the generalized antisymmetric tensor product between two operators from distinct systems of which one is fermionic and the other is not , reduces to the usual tensor product between operators . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two operators are from two distinct fermionic systems then it reduces to the antisymmetric tensor product for operators of fermionic systems .",
    "this is exactly how it should be : non - fermionic operators from one system commute with all operators from the other systems , and the fermionic ones anti - commute with fermionic operators from the other systems . by inspection",
    "it is easy to see that the generalized antisymmetric tensor product defined in this way has the associative property , hence it is unambiguously defined for systems that are the composite of any finite number of fermionic and non - fermionic systems .    _",
