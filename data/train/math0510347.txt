    "other lines are untouched except the following case : the vertex @xmath286 is joined to two vertices @xmath317 by dotted lines .",
    "then after the flop , the two dotted lines are replaced by solid lines , and furthermore @xmath318 and @xmath319 are joined by a dotted line .",
    "surely this process is symmetric , i.e. , if @xmath286 is joined to @xmath320 by solid lines and @xmath320 are joined by dotted line , then after the flop along @xmath286 , the dotted line between @xmath318 and @xmath319 should be removed , and the solid lines joining @xmath286 to @xmath320 are replaced by dotted ones .",
    "now we describe how the vertex labels change . since the process is symmetric , we only describe the changes when @xmath11 is a vertex joined to @xmath286 by a solid line .",
    "suppose that @xmath11 is labeled by an ellipse ( i.e. , a one point blow - up of @xmath291 ) .",
    "there are two cases :    \\(i ) the solid line comes from a dotted line , i.e. , this line corresponds to the exceptional fiber of the one point blow - up of @xmath291 , then the label at @xmath11 is changed to a square ( i.e. , @xmath291 ) ;        any projective symplectic resolutions of @xmath4 is obtained in this way .",
    "however , it is not clear ( and it may be not true ) that any sequence of mukai flops gives a projective symplectic resolution .",
