    "high porosity silica aerogels are the only known means for studying the effect of impurities on the otherwise completely pure superfluid phases of @xmath3he .",
    "recently there has been substantial interest in exploring the role of structural anisotropy in the aerogel and how it pertains to superfluid phase stability , textural orientation , spin dynamics , and nucleation .",
    "the narrow window of _ a_-like phase stability might be explained by the existence of anisotropy in the aerogel structure @xcite .",
    "the possibility of using anisotropic aerogels to stabilize superfluid phases not present in bulk @xmath3he , such as the polar phase , has also been explored theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "experimental work has shown that anisotropy affects the orientational degrees of freedom in both the _ a_-like and _",
    "b_-like phases @xcite and anisotropic aerogels allow for the realization of novel spin dynamical states not possible in bulk @xcite .",
    "the nucleation of the _ b_-like phase may also be modified by anisotropy in the aerogel @xcite .",
    "we report on measurements of the transverse acoustic impedance of superfluid @xmath3he confined in a 97.8% porous aerogel with well defined axial anisotropy to study the role of anisotropy on phase stability and nucleation .",
    "optical birefringence in a transparent or translucent material results from an anisotropic dielectric constant , which leads to an optical axis in the material .",
    "the optical axis acts as a linear polarizer whose direction and distribution throughout the sample can be determined by viewing the material between crossed polarizers @xcite .",
    "we have previously shown that axial strain can be used to produce _ global _ structural anisotropy in high porosity silica aerogel and that this anisotropy can be characterized by optical birefringence @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts how axial strain introduces anisotropy into an initially isotropic 98% porous aerogel .",
    "all aerogels discussed here were synthesized at northwestern university via a one - step sol - gel process followed by supercritical drying @xcite .",
    "a cylindrical aerogel sample was placed between two crossed polarizers and illuminated with diffuse white light .",
    "the sample was oriented vertically and images were captured with a digital camera .",
    "the polarizers were oriented with one at 45@xmath4 and the other at 135@xmath4 relative to the cylinder axis .",
    "panel 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the unstrained gel does not impose any preferred direction of polarization when placed between crossed polarizers .",
    "we found this to be the case for all orientations of the polarizers with respect to the cylinder axis .",
    "we also found that light propagating along the cylinder axis was not transmitted before the sample was strained .",
    "consequently , we refer to the nature of this aerogel sample prior to the application of strain as homogeneously isotropic .",
    "the increasing intensity of light transmitted through the sample with increasing strain in panels 2 - 9 indicate how global anisotropy was introduced as the sample was strained up to 18.6% .",

    "transverse acoustic impedance is sensitive to phase transitions of superfluid @xmath3he in aerogel , and the technique has been used to map out the pressure - temperature phase diagram in unstrained aerogel samples @xcite . to explore the role of axial strain , we have performed measurements of transverse acoustic impedance at 17.6 mhz in a sample of 97.8% porous aerogel grown onto the surface of an _",
    "ac_-cut quartz piezoelectric transducer and strained by 17% @xcite .",
    "the impedance was measured using a continuous wave rf - bridge @xcite .",
    "the sample cell was cooled in liquid @xmath3he using a dilution refrigerator , followed by adiabatic nuclear demagnetization .",
    "we monitored the temperature of the @xmath3he by measuring the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibiliy of a paramagnetic salt ( lcmn ) @xcite , calibrated with respect to the greywall temperature scale @xcite .",
    "the sample cell consisted of an open cavity between two parallel transducers separated by two spacer wires of diameter 0.0305 cm . alongside and between these spacer wires were two smaller wires of diameter 0.0254 cm .",
    "in this configuration the cavity was held under tension by a stainless steel spring , see fig .",
    "aerogel was grown directly in the cavity and onto the surfaces of the transducers .",
    "excess aerogel around the cavity was removed such that the outer surfaces of the transducers would be in contact with bulk @xmath3he",
    ". then the large diameter spacers wires were removed and the spring compressed the aerogel onto the small diameter wires .",
    "this procedure resulted in 17% strain . to verify the existence of global anisotropy in our sample after the compression procedure , we performed optical birefringence measurements on the aerogel cavity after the experiment was completed .",
