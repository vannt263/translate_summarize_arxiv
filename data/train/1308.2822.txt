    "in the past researchers were often deeply convinced of the absolute validity of the ruling set of theories , and yet the set was later inevitably replaced by a more fundamental one of which the old one has remained a special case . in this respect",
    "it seems of supreme importance to keep performing dedicated tests of foundations of quantum physics with the goal of possibly finding a cue for deviations from what we presently expect . a vast majority of the tests performed to date contrast quantum mechanical predictions with the predictions of those theories that preserve one or other notion of classical physics intact .",
    "examples are hidden - variable theories  @xcite , non - linear modifications of the schrdinger equation  @xcite or the collapse models  @xcite .",
    "hidden variables pre - assign definite values to outcomes of unperformed measurements , non - linear schrdinger equations allow solutions with localized wave - packets to resemble classical trajectories and collapse models restore macrorealism by suppressing superpositions between macroscopically distinct states . judging from historical experience",
    ", however , it seems very unlikely that a post - quantum theory will be based on pre - quantum concepts .",
    "in contrast , one might expect that it will break not only postulates of classical but also quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics can be seen as particular theory of the class of generalized probabilistic theories  @xcite .",
    "these theories share with quantum mechanics its non - classical features such as randomness of individual results , the impossibility of copying unknown states  @xcite , violation of bell s inequalities  @xcite , uncertainty relations  @xcite or interference  @xcite .",
    "recent progress in reconstructions of quantum formalism give a variety of choices for postulates on which quantum theory can be singled out from the class of generalized probabilistic theories  @xcite .",
    "quantum interference is standardly explained through the double - slit experiment , where one combines superposition principle and born rule to derive the `` interference term ''  a quantity that vanishes in all classical experiments .",
    "if one considers multi - slit interference experiments there is a very natural hierarchy of probabilistic theories due to sorkin  @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy is described by the _ order of interference _ @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) defined by the outcome probabilities in @xmath2-slit experiment .",
    "one may consider @xmath0 as a measure of genuine coherence between @xmath2 slits .",
    "sorkin showed that quantum mechanics exhibits only two - slit interference , but no genuine three - slit or higher - order interferences .",
    "this demonstrates that a theory that exhibits , for example , genuine three - slit interference @xmath3 is essentially a non - quantum theory though no explicit such theory is known .",
    "recently , an experiment has been performed that puts a bound to third - order interference term to less than @xmath4 of the regular second order interference  @xcite and further experiments are planned to improve the bound  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we give operational arguments why the theory that exhibits the @xmath2th - order interference describes physical states by tensors with @xmath2 indices .",
    "for example , classical probability theory as a first - order theory represents states by a ( probability ) vector ( one - index tensor ) and quantum theory by a density matrix .",
    "similarly , for a third - order theory one needs an object with three indices and we call it a _ density cube_. we develop a theory of density cubes and show that it contains quantum theory as a subset , the same way quantum theory contains classical theory as a subset .",
    "we derive a class of non - quantum states and show that there exists non - trivial dynamics that maps between quantum and non - quantum states .",
    "all this allows creation , manipulation and tomography of density cubes as well as violation of the leggett - garg inequality  @xcite beyond the quantum tsirelson bound for temporal correlations  @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the absence of third - order interference implies the validity of tsirelson s bound for spatial correlations for a broad class of probabilistic theories  @xcite .",
    "in ref .  @xcite sorkin suggested a classification of theories according to the order of interference the theory exhibits . roughly speaking ,",
    "the order indicates how much the calculus of the predicted probabilities in the theory deviates from the one in classical physics . to demonstrate the interference phenomenon we first consider the double - slit experiment , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , and a series of set - ups in which each slit is either open or closed .",
    "we distinguish four situations : both slits are open , either one of them is closed and both are closed .",
    "the four physical situations are labeled as @xmath5 , where , e.g. @xmath6 denotes the scenario with the lower slit blocked .",
    "the `` non - classicality '' is measured via the interference term : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conditional probability to find the particle at a certain point on the observation screen given that situation @xmath9 is realized .",
    "of course , @xmath10 always vanishes bringing no contribution to the value of @xmath11 and we introduce it only for symmetry reasons and future generalization .",
    "classical theory of bullets belongs to the lowest class in this hierarchy because @xmath12 .",
    "quantum theory is an example of a theory for which @xmath11 does not vanish , and we call this feature the second - order interference .",
    "consider now a triple - slit experiment .",
    "one could propose to measure the third - order interference by the quantity @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the conditional probability to detect the particle at a certain point on the observation screen , if the upper slit is open and the middle and the lower slits are blocked ( see lower panel of fig .  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath15 can solely be due to the non - vanishing second - order interference terms . in order to quantify genuine third - order interference",
    "one thus needs to subtract all the two - order interference terms @xmath16 from @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , as a measure of genuine third - order interference one introduces @xmath18 where again the last term @xmath19 always vanishes .",
    "straightforward calculation shows that @xmath20 in quantum theory , regardless of the hilbert space dimension of the system and the type of measurement .",
    "in fact all theories that are represented by jordan algebras  @xcite have vanishing the third - order interference as well .",
    "examples contain quantum mechanics based on complex , quaternion or octonion probability amplitudes .",
    "the theories for which the third - order interference term is zero have been characterized as those in which it is possible to fully determine the state , i.e. to perform state tomography , via a complete set of single - slit and double - slit experiments  @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the sorkin s quantity @xmath21 measuring the genuine @xmath2th - order interference is a sum of interference terms for all combinations of open slits where the terms involving @xmath22 slits , for odd @xmath23 , enter with a minus sign and for even @xmath23 , with a plus sign .",
    "if @xmath24 , then all @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , also vanish  @xcite .",
    "the level of a theory is the highest @xmath2 for which the sorkin s quantity @xmath21 does not vanish .",
    "we will now develop an explicit theory that belongs to the sorkin s class of theories with non - vanishing third - order interference .",
    "the theory contains quantum theory as a subset .    the fact that @xmath20 in quantum mechanics can be traced back to the description of state in terms of density matrix elements @xmath27 that link coherently at most _ two _ different states @xmath28 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that if a theory should allow for @xmath29 , then the description of the state in the theory should involve elements that link _ three _ different states @xmath28 , @xmath23 , @xmath2 , i.e. it should have elements of the form @xmath30 .",
    "we consider a framework in which the description of the state is given by the tensor with elements @xmath30 , and we call it a density cube .",
    "we follow the analogy to the quantum case in order to define the basic ingredients of the theory . to every measurement outcome",
    "we associate a density cube with , in general , complex entries @xmath30 .",
    "the element @xmath31 is chosen to be real and gives the probability for the outcome @xmath28 , therefore @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the born rule in quantum mechanics reads @xmath34 , where we adopt einstein s summation rule . in a similar manner",
    "we define @xmath35 here @xmath36 denotes the probability , whereas @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are the state and element of a projective measurement , respectively . note , that we follow the analogy to quantum theory where there exists a compete identification between states and measurements",
    ". therefore , @xmath37 and @xmath38 belong essentially to the same set . to ensure that @xmath36 is a real number , we put the constraint @xmath39 . in the quantum case @xmath40",
    "is provided by the fact that @xmath27 is a hermitian matrix , hence @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , we expect @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is some permutation of indices @xmath44 .",
    "the condition @xmath45 implies that @xmath46 is the index transposition .",
    "accordingly , we call the cubes hermitian if exchanging two indices gives a complex conjugated element . as in the case of hermitian matrices ,",
    "hermitian cubes form a real vector space with the inner product given by  ( [ br ] ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath47 . for @xmath30 being a pure state we expect @xmath48 .",
    "for a system with two distinguishable outcomes , the hermiticity constraint together with the normalization condition reads : @xmath49 there are three independent real parameters here , e.g. @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , and we can write a density cube as a list of two matrices @xmath53 where the @xmath28th list element is the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "we set @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . in this parametrization",
    "the normalization condition for pure states @xmath48 is equivalent to @xmath57 , therefore the set of pure states is isomorphic to the bloch sphere .",
    "we can define the four pauli cubes @xmath58 they span the set of hermitian cubes and we can write @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . hence , the set of density cubes for a two - level system is equivalent to the set of states of a qubit .",
    "this is intuitively expected as the departure from quantum theory should rather be seen if at least three states are allowed due to genuine third - order interference .",
    "for the case of three - level system the hermiticity condition together with normalization reads : @xmath61 hence we have in total ten real parameters : @xmath62 and @xmath63 with all three different indices , which is two real parameters more ( one complex parameter ) than what is required to describe a general state of a quantum mechanical three - level system , a qutrit .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 brings the crucial difference between the density matrix and the density cube . if @xmath65 the set of cube states is equivalent to the qutrit state space .",
    "indeed , we can map any density matrix @xmath27 to the density cube @xmath30 with @xmath65 in the following way @xmath66 and vice versa .",
    "this mapping preserves the inner product , thus we have a complete ( physical ) identification between the two sets .",
    "the analysis becomes more intriguing when we consider some genuine non - quantum @xmath30 with @xmath67 .",
    "positivity condition for two density cubes @xmath37 and @xmath38 has to be fulfilled , hence @xmath68 .",
    "the complete characterization of the set of density cubes remains an open problem , and here we present one explicit class of states that is in agreement with the positivity condition and extends standard quantum theory . consider the pure states @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "they form a `` basis set '' @xmath71 .",
    "when we refer to the `` basis set '' of density cubes , we mean the set of normalized , mutually orthogonal density cubes .",
    "operationally , it means that states @xmath72 can be distinguished in a single - shot experiment .",
    "note , that this set is not a complete basis in the vector space of hermitian cubes .",
    "the quantum parts of these states correspond to density matrices @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are the states of the standard ( computational ) basis , e.g. @xmath75 . this way , to each pure quantum state @xmath76 , we can associate one of three density cubes @xmath77 with the following elements @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "straightforward verification shows @xmath80 , hence the positivity is preserved .",
    "furthermore , one can verify that there are at most three mutually orthogonal density cubes , within the class of states @xmath77 .",
    "we derived the class of `` non - trivial '' density cubes , and the next step is to give an example of genuine `` non - quantum '' transformation ( evolution ) .",
    "we define the unitary ( norm preserving ) transformation @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the standard basis set , i.e. @xmath83_{ijk}=\\delta_{in}\\delta_{jn}\\delta_{kn}$ ] and @xmath84 is the basis set defined in eq .",
    "( [ example ] ) . rather than working directly with the whole set of hermitian cubes we define the following subspace spanned by the ( sub)basis @xmath85 note that this is not a complete basis within the vector space of hermitian cubes .",
    "however , we assume that @xmath86 keeps the subspace spanned by the subbasis invariant , that is if @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , then necessarily @xmath89 . recall that @xmath86 has been defined as a unitary transformation .",
    "therefore , within this invariant subspace , @xmath86 is represented by a @xmath90 unitary matrix .",
    "the basis sets @xmath91 and @xmath92 are represented by the vectors @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the condition @xmath94 leads to the following matrix @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are unknown coefficients .",

    "suppose that some unitary @xmath102 maps the vector of the standard basis @xmath74 such that @xmath103 .",
    "note that matrix @xmath102 has zeros at the main diagonal , whereas all the off - diagonal elements have non - zero value .",
    "this implies that its columns can not form a set of orthogonal vectors , and thus @xmath102 is not a unitary matrix .      when a measurement is performed and an outcome is obtained , our knowledge about the state of the system changes and its representation must be updated to be in agreement with the new knowledge acquired in the measurement . in quantum theory , when we refer to a state of a @xmath104-level system defined by a density matrix @xmath27 , we implicitly assume that the matrix elements are defined with respect to some basis of orthogonal states @xmath105 .",
    "we call this basis set a measurement or computational basis .",
    "if a projective ( selective or von neumann ) measurement is performed and outcome @xmath106 has been observed , the state is updated to a pure state @xmath107 , and each outcome occurs with the probability @xmath108 . an operational argument for this update rule is that immediate consecutive measurements of the same observable should give the same result .",
    "more generally , a non - selective measurement can be performed , i.e. the outcomes are `` merged '' into @xmath109 non - overlapping slots that correspond to the partition of basis @xmath110 .",
    "the set of outcomes is fully specified by the set of orthogonal projectors @xmath111 , each of which projects onto subspace spanned by @xmath112 . in this case , for an outcome @xmath113 obtained in a measurement , the generalized projection postulate ( l \" uders rule  @xcite ) applies @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",

    "therefore macrorealism is violated by the phenomenon of quantum interference .",
    "similarly , the cube theory as well as all higher - order tensor theories are at variance with the premises of macroscopic realism .",
    "let us begin by recalling the assumptions of macro - realism  @xcite :    * macrorealism per se : `` a macroscopic object , which has available to it two or more macroscopically distinct states , is at any given time in a definite one of those states . ''",
    "* noninvasive measurability : `` it is possible in principle to determine which of these states the system is in without any effect on the state itself , or on the subsequent system dynamics . ''    under these assumptions we now derive condition @xmath180 .",
    "consider an evolving macro - realistic system measured at times @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "assume that at time @xmath146 it is in one of two macroscopically distinct states .",
    "one may think about a bullet shot into a double - slit experiment that at time @xmath146 propagates through one of the two slits . here",
    "the macroscopic state is the position of the bullet , i.e. at @xmath146 the position of the slit it goes through .",
    "the measuring apparatus at @xmath146 has the following four settings :    * `` 00 '' both slits open * `` 10 '' only second slit open * `` 01 '' only first slit open * `` 11 '' both slits closed    at time @xmath147 , a different apparatus verifies if a system is in a possibly different macro - state we call `` @xmath181 '' ( this could be position of the object at the observation screen placed behind the screen containing the slits ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 the probability of observing the `` @xmath181 '' result at time @xmath147 , if setting @xmath9 was chosen at time @xmath146 . clearly , @xmath182 .",
    "due to the macro - realism assumptions the probability @xmath183 has to be given by the sum @xmath184 , as in every experimental run the system takes a well defined path through a single slit ( macrorealism per se ) and its future dynamics is independent of whether the unoccupied slit is opened or closed ( non - invasiveness ) .",
    "therefore , condition @xmath12 can be seen as the simplest leggett - garg equality .",
    "one might think that in order to observe genuine multi - slit interference it is necessary to modify the born rule , i.e. the probability of a particular result should not be given by the inner product between the relevant states of the theory but perhaps by its different power .",
    "this is not the case as we presented here an explicit theory that does satisfy the born rule but nevertheless allows for higher - order interference .",
    "the state in the theory is represented by a mathematical object called `` density cube '' and is a natural generalization of the standard `` density matrix '' in quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum mechanics is contained in the theory of density cubes , but the latter in addition contains new `` coherence terms '' that give rise to the genuine third - order interference in sorkin s classification .",
    "the theory of density cubes is the first explicit example of a model exhibiting higher - order interference .",
    "we have shown that density cubes allow violation of the temporal tsirelson bound for the leggett - garg inequalities , thus illustrating the stronger - than - quantum correlations .",
