    "in 1900 paul drude introduced a classical model @xcite for the motion of electrons in a material with the aim of studying transport properties such as conductivity of metals .",
    "in particular ohm s law could be derived from the model . in 1933",
    "the model was supplemented with results from quantum theory by hans bethe and arnold sommerfeld as what is now known as the drude - sommerfeld or free electron model .",
    "anderson discovered in 1958 that at low energy electronic transport could break down in disordered media , provided the disorder is sufficiently strong @xcite . in particular",
    "the eigenstates in this regime are exponentially localized .",
    "this phenomenon is today known as anderson localization .",
    "a key question concerns the transition from a localized to a delocalized regime when the disorder becomes small compared with the energy . in 1979 ,",
    "abrahams , anderson , licciardello and ramakrishnan proposed their scaling theory which suggests that such a transition should exist in dimension @xmath4 , the case @xmath5 being critical , whereas for @xmath6 there is only a localized regime .",
    "regarding @xmath5 the widely held belief is that no transition exists , however the localization length can be very large compared with the size of the system .",
    "the type of disordered system considered in this paper is a box @xmath7^d$ ] , @xmath8 , which contains @xmath9 independently uniformly distributed impurities , which are modeled by dirac masses ( also known as fermi s pseudo - potential , delta potentials or point scatterers ) . in this paper",
    "we will consider periodic boundary conditions , i.e. we will study flat tori @xmath10 .",
    "however , our results can easily be generalized for dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "by a random schrdinger operator on @xmath11 we mean the following type of stochastic differential operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is a stochastic process on @xmath11 .",
    "a simplified model @xmath15 replaces @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes a dirac mass centered at the origin .",
    "such a `` potential '' is known as fermi s pseudo - potential , a delta potential or a point scatterer .",
    "the model approximates the generic random schrdinger operator @xmath18 well in the regime , where @xmath19 , and where @xmath20 denotes the wavelength , and @xmath21 the energy .",
    "the advantage of considering the formal operator @xmath15 is that it can be realized as a self - adjoint extension of the restricted laplacian @xmath22 , which is a positive symmetric operator with deficiency indices @xmath23 .",
    "the extensions are parametrized by a unitary matrix @xmath24 , and the corresponding self - adjoint extension is given by the restriction of the adjoint @xmath25 to the domain of functions @xmath26 which are of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are incoming and outgoing circular waves at the point @xmath31 .",
    "we note that the parameter space of self - adjoint extensions is much larger than the physical parameter space which is of dimension @xmath9 ( there are @xmath9 real coupling constants ) .",
    "in fact a non - diagonal matrix @xmath32 corresponds to an extension which violates local conservation of mass in the scattering process ( i. e. it is possible for part of the wave to enter into one impurity and emerge from another , as if a wire were attached between the two points ) . assuming local conservation of mass in all scattering processes we reduce the parameter space to the subgroup of diagonal unitary matrices @xmath33 .",
    "note that the operator @xmath15 corresponds to a matrix @xmath34 , for some @xmath35 , since all coupling constants are equal to @xmath36 .",

    "]    let us consider a particular type of random schrdinger operator on @xmath3 , a random displacement model ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) @xmath38 where the displacements @xmath39 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with radially symmetric probability density @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 strictly decreasing .",
    "the disorder in the present system can for instance be measured by the average displacement , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a random variable with probability density @xmath45 .    if the probability distribution @xmath45 were given by a dirac distribution centered at the origin , i.e. if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then we know from bloch s theorem that the spectrum has a continuous band structure with corresponding extended eigenstates .",
    "however , if there is sufficiently strong disorder , i.e. @xmath48 is large enough , then we have , almost surely , pure point spectrum and the corresponding eigenstates are exponentially localized at the bottom of the spectrum .",

    "pure point spectrum on @xmath50 $ ] and the eigenfunctions @xmath51 satisfy the bound : @xmath52 where the localization length @xmath53 depends on @xmath54 and the localization centre @xmath55 as well as the constant @xmath56 depend on the sample @xmath57 .",
    "mathematical proofs of anderson localization were for instance obtained by goldsheid , molchanov and pastur @xcite , frhlich and spencer @xcite , simon @xcite , bourgain and kenig @xcite , klopp @xcite and germinet @xcite .",
    "however , a crucial question concerns the existence of a delocalization transition in the regime where the disorder is small compared with the energy , in the case of a random displacement model : @xmath58 .    in 1979 ,",
    "the `` gang of four '' , abrahams , anderson , licciardello and ramakrishnan @xcite proposed what is now known as the `` scaling theory of localization '' which predicted that the answer should depend on the dimension @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath6 the theory predicts that there is only a localized regime , i.e. any amount of disorder is sufficient to localize all eigenstates .",
    "for @xmath60 it predicts the existence of a delocalization transition , i.e. when the disorder is sufficiently small compared with the energy , the eigenstates should become delocalized .",
    "the case @xmath5 was identified as critical , and it was famously conjectured that there should only be a localized regime , however , the localization length could be very large .",
    "the mathematical characteristics of the delocalized regime are continuous band structure above a certain energy threshold and associated extended eigenstates .",
    "a very interesting phenomenon is observed near the transition point between the two regimes , where physicists have observed a multifractal structure of the eigenstates @xcite .",
    "very few rigorous mathematical results exist regarding the multifractal or delocalized regime . we will continue to describe some rigorous results about the geometry of the eigenstates of poisson random schrdinger operators with dirac masses on flat tori .",
    "in particular these compact models allow us to give polynomial lower bounds on the localization length on @xmath3 .",
    "in fact for certain stochastic processes , such as random displacement models , one can go much further and prove the breakdown of exponential localization for sufficiently large eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "we will sketch these results at the end of this paper .",
    "we consider a flat torus @xmath11 , @xmath1 with @xmath9 independent uniformly distributed delta potentials located at the points @xmath61and we let @xmath62 .",
    "we denote the associated self - adjoint extension of @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "we denote the green s function , the resolvent kernel of the laplacian on @xmath11 by @xmath65    the spectrum of @xmath64 consists of two parts , old eigenfunctions of the laplacian which vanish on @xmath13 and new eigenfunctions which , almost surely , diverge at each point in @xmath13 .",
    "the divergence is of order @xmath66 in @xmath5 and of order @xmath67 in @xmath68 .",
    "the new eigenvalues are solutions of the equation @xmath69 where the matrix entries are given by @xmath70 in particular one can show that per old laplacian eigenspace the self - adjoint extension @xmath64 produces at most @xmath9 new eigenvalues , which almost surely lie in between two neighbouring laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "the associated new eigenfunctions are superpositions of green s functions @xmath71 and we recall @xmath72 .",
    "also note that @xmath73 is a function of the random variables @xmath74 .",
    "given @xmath75 , the matrix @xmath76 has almost surely rank @xmath77 which implies @xmath78 , so the choice of @xmath73 is unique up to normalization .",
    "the aim of this section is to given information on the geometry of the new eigenfunctions of the random operator @xmath64 . for a large number @xmath9 of impurities",
    "we expect the eigenfunctions to be exponentially localized at the bottom of the spectrum . however",
    ", we will show that for sufficiently large eigenvalues there exist , with a certain positive probability ( which tends to zero as @xmath79 ) , eigenfunctions which are uniformly distributed on the torus @xmath11 .",
    "in particular this fact gives information on the size of the localization length , yielding a certain polynomial lower bound .",
    "before we state our main result we recall that each new eigenvalue @xmath80 satisfies almost surely @xmath81 for some @xmath82 .",
    "we have the following result .",
    "denote the laplacian eigenvalues on @xmath11 by @xmath83 .",
    "fix any @xmath84 .",
    "there exists @xmath85 , an index subset of full density such that for any @xmath86 and any new eigenvalue of @xmath64 , @xmath81 , we have with probability @xmath87 for all @xmath88 , s.t . @xmath89 . ] , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92",
    ".    we may now apply this result to give a lower bound on the localization length . the equidistribution theorem above implies that if we are still in the localized regime , then the localization length must exceed the size of the torus : @xmath93    let us now fix a positive density of impurities @xmath94 and observe that our stochastic process on @xmath11 converges to a poisson process of density @xmath95 on @xmath3 in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "our equidistribution result on the torus of @xmath11 therefore gives information on the localization length for a schrdinger operator with poisson delta potentials on @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , equidistribution occurs when @xmath96 where @xmath97    and this implies that the localization length must satisfy the lower bound @xmath98",
    "consider the square torus @xmath99 .",

    "we have @xmath104 were @xmath105    our goal is to show that a matrix element correponding to a nonzero mode @xmath106 , @xmath107 , is small if @xmath108 .    let us define the annulus @xmath109    using chebyshev s inequality one can show that with probability @xmath87 we have @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 is the best known exponent ( due to huxley @xcite ) in the circle law @xmath113    for a density one subsequence of new eigenvalues @xmath80 we have that @xmath114 implies @xmath115 so that @xmath116 also the error term in the circle law implies the following bound on the number of lattice points in a thin annulus @xmath117    combining the bounds above we obtain the estimate ( recall @xmath118 ) @xmath119    furthermore , we have for a density one subsequence of eigenvalues @xmath80 the lower bound @xmath120 so , for generic @xmath80 , the following bound holds with probability @xmath121 @xmath122    this argument can easily be extended for any trigonometric polynomial with nonzero frequencies .",
    "the result for a general torus @xmath123 then follows by a simple scaling argument .",

    "one of the problems with definition [ loc ] is that the localization centre depends on the sample @xmath57 . to observe localization",
    "it is therefore advisable to consider the two - point correlation function of the smoothed eigenfunction @xmath134 which is defined for any two points @xmath135 by @xmath136 the decay is then observed with respect to the distance @xmath137 , which is independent of the sample @xmath138 .",

    "one of the key obstructions to doing this is the dependence on the number of potentials , @xmath155 , in the error term in equation .",
    "however , we are able to improve the estimate of the error term significantly in the case of random displacement models : fix @xmath156 and any @xmath157 .",
