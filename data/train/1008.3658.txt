    "in 1940 kramers derived chemical reaction rates from certain limits in a fokker - planck equation that describes the probability density of a brownian particle in an energy landscape @xcite .",
    "the limit of high activation energy has been revisited in a recent paper by peletier et al @xcite , where a spatially inhomogeneous extension of kramers formula is rigorously derived for unimolecular reactions between two chemical states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "their derivation relies on passing to the limit in the @xmath2-gradient flow structure of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "it is well - known by now that the fokker - planck equation has also an interpretation as a wasserstein gradient flow @xcite and the question was raised in @xcite whether kramers formula can also be derived and interpreted within this wasserstein gradient flow structure .",
    "this concept has also been investigated on a formal level for more complicated reaction - diffusion systems in @xcite . a further motivation for studying the fokker - planck equation within the wasserstein framework comes from applications that additionally prescribe the time evolution of a moment @xcite .",
    "in this note we present a rigorous derivation which is based on passing to the limit within the wasserstein gradient flow structure . to keep things simple",
    "we restrict ourselves to the spatially homogeneous case and consider the simplest case of a unimolecular reaction between two chemical states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are represented as two wells of an enthalpy function @xmath3 . to avoid unimportant technicalities we assume that the enthalpy function @xmath4 is a ` typical ' double",
    "- well potential .",
    "specifically , we assume that @xmath4 is a smooth , nonnegative and even function that satisfies @xmath5 with @xmath6 the probability density of a molecule with chemical state @xmath7 is in the following denoted by @xmath8 . in kramers approach",
    "the molecule performs a brownian motion in the energy landscape described by @xmath4 , so the evolution of @xmath8 is governed by the kramers - smoluchowski equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the so - called viscosity coefficient . in what follows we consider the high activation energy limit @xmath11 .",
    "the leading order dynamics of can be derived by formal asymptotics and governs the evolution of @xmath12 which satisfy @xmath13 due to @xmath14 .",
    "using wkb methods , for instance , one finds @xmath15 we emphasize that the constant @xmath16 depends on the details of the function @xmath4 near its two local minima and its local maximum , and that the time scale is exponentially slow in the height barrier @xmath17 between the two wells .",
    "our goal is to derive rigorously by passing to the limit @xmath18 in . in order to derive a non - trivial limit",
    "we have to rescale time accordingly .",
    "thus we consider in the following the probability distribution @xmath19 that is a solution of @xmath20 an important role in the analysis will be played by the unique invariant measure @xmath21 which converges in the weak@xmath22 topology of probability measures to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the delta distributions in @xmath25 ,    as in @xcite it is often convenient to switch to the density of @xmath26 with respect to @xmath27 , that is @xmath28 .",
    "heuristically we expect that @xmath29 is  to leading order in @xmath10  piecewise constant for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the respective values correspond to @xmath32 and @xmath33 as introduced above . in what follows",
    "we write @xmath34 instead of @xmath32 , so @xmath33 is given by @xmath35 .    for the derivation of the limit equation",
    "we assume that our data are well - prepared .",
    "[ t.1 ] let @xmath36 and @xmath16 be as in , and for each @xmath10 let @xmath37 be a solution to with initial datum @xmath38 . moreover ,",
    "suppose that the initial data @xmath38 are probability measures on @xmath39 that converge weakly@xmath22 as @xmath40 to some probability measure @xmath41 , and satisfy @xmath42 with constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 independent of @xmath10 .",
    "then , for all @xmath45 we have that @xmath46 weakly@xmath22 in the space of probability measures , where the function @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "this result has already been derived in @xcite in the more general setting with spatial diffusion and under slightly weaker assumptions on the initial data .",
    "our main contribution here is therefore not the result as such , but the method of proof .",
    "we answer the question posed in @xcite , how the passage to the limit can be performed within a wasserstein gradient flow structure and we identify the corresponding structure for the limit .",
    "we present the formal gradient flow structures of as well as in section  [ sec : structure ] . in order to derive the limit equation we pass to the limit in the rayleigh principle that is associated to any gradient flow .",
    "this strategy is inspired by the notion of @xmath50-convergence and has already been successfully employed in other singular limits of gradient flows ( e.g. in @xcite ) . in section  [ s.compactness ]",
    "we first obtain some basic a priori estimates as well as an approximation for @xmath29 that will be essential in the identification of the limit gradient flow structure .",
    "it is somewhat unsatisfactory that we can not derive suitable estimates solely from the energy estimates associated to the wasserstein gradient flow .",
    "instead we use the estimates that correspond to the @xmath2-gradient flow structure that is satisfied by @xmath29 .",
    "it is not obvious to us how this can be avoided .",
    "section  [ s.proofs ] finally contains our main result , that is the novel proof of theorem  [ t.1 ] .",

    "the limit is a solution of .",
    "we briefly summarize the wasserstein gradient structure of the fokker - planck equation as well as the corresponding gradient flow structure of the limit problem . to point out the key ideas we give a formal exposition and",
