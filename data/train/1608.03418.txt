    "since the invention of laser in the year of 1960 @xcite , laser technology has witnessed an immense progress @xcite .",
    "the revolutionary invention of the chirped pulse amplification technique brought the laser to a completely new level @xcite .",
    "roughly twenty years later a record peak intensity of order @xmath1 was reached by focusing a 45-tw laser beam @xcite .",
    "recently , a compression scheme has been proposed that opens the possibility to generate ultra - short and ultra - strong laser pulses with focused intensities of @xmath2 and duration of 2fs @xcite .",
    "this progress offers an opportunity to study new physical phenomena of laser plasma interactions .",
    "one of the most important processes in this field is the hhg , which has been studying very intensely nowadays .",
    "as the minimum achievable duration of laser pulses continuously reduces towards few femtoseconds , the generation of even shorter pulses ( in the attosecond or even zeptosecond range ) is possible only for radiation with shorter wavelengths .",
    "the reduction of the pulse duration and the radiation wavelength would open new horizons for potential applications .",
    "this is the main motivation to study the hhg .",
    "first observations of hhg from plasmas were made in 1981 @xcite .",
    "rather matured is hhg in gases that allows to generate single attosecond pulses with duration less than 1fs @xcite .",
    "however , this method of hhg requires the limitation of laser pulse intensity by maximum @xmath3 in order to prevent the ionization .",
    "fortunately , there is another method of efficient production of high order harmonics by unlimited laser power .",
    "this is the interaction process of high contrast laser pulses @xcite with solid density targets .",
    "the pedestal of the pulse ionizes the surface and the main pulse interacts with electrons of the overdense plasma , while ions remain nearly immobile during the short pulse duration .",
    "one distinguishes two main hhg mechanisms in this case : coherent wake emission ( cwe ) @xcite and the `` relativistically oscillating mirror '' ( rom ) @xcite .",
    "cwe is caused by fast brunel electrons @xcite , which excite plasma oscillations at the local plasma frequencies .",
    "thus , there are no harmonics beyond the maximal plasma frequency in the case of cwe .",
    "this process dominates for non - relativistic laser intensities @xmath4 . for @xmath5",
    "the harmonics are generated mostly via the rom mechanism . in this case , the electron layer at the plasma surface acts as a mirror that oscillates at relativistic velocities , resulting in the generation of high order harmonics via doppler effect when the surface moves towards the incident wave . during this process",
    "there is no limit of frequency like by cwe , so higher harmonics can be generated .",
    "the first theoretical description of rom claimed that the intensity spectrum envelope of reflected wave can be described by @xmath6 up to the  roll over ",
    "frequency @xmath7 which is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the harmonic order and @xmath10 is the relativistic gamma factor @xcite .",
    "later this theory was improved , especially the acceleration of the reflecting layer was taken into account .",
    "this leads to the power law @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this model assumes the existence of a so called apparent reflection point ( arp ) where the transverse electric field vanishes .",
    "predictions based on that model where experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "most recently another hhg mechanism was discovered .",
    "using p - polarized oblique incident light with @xmath5 one can cause the formation of extremely dense electron nanobunches under appropriate conditions .",
    "these bunches can emit attosecond pulses with intensities much larger compared to the incident pulse @xcite .",
    "this means that the boundary condition assumed in @xcite corresponding to arp fails and thus the rom theory can not be applied in this case .",
    "this process is called coherent synchrotron emission ( cse ) .",
    "the reflected radiation in case of cse in characterized by the power law @xmath13 or @xmath14 which is flatter comparing to rom @xcite .",
    "the corresponding experiments can be found in ref .",
    "detailed numerical investigation of the case of p - polarized oblique incidence in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that the rom model can be violated when the similarity parameter @xmath15 ( where @xmath9 is the electron density given in units of the critical density @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the dimensionless laser amplitude @xcite ) is smaller than five .",
    "the authors of @xcite present a new relativistic electronic spring ( res ) model for @xmath18 .",
    "since usually one obtains a train of attosecond pulses by hhg , the question is whether it is possible to isolate one single pulse .",
    "one method is to use the polarization gate technique @xcite .",
    "this is important because it opens the opportunity to a number of potential applications @xcite .",
    "successful application of @xmath19 focusing could even lead to investigation of vacuum instabilities @xcite .",
    "we pursue two main goals in this work .",
    "the first one is to provide a more detailed analytical description of the spectrum in the case of cse compared to @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we introduce an analytical approach which allows us to calculate the electron density profile of the given nanobunch as well as its current distribution , that are used in formulas for back - radiating spectrum derived in @xcite .",
    "subsequently we compare the derived expressions with one - dimensional simulation results done with the vlpl pic code .",
    "the second aim is to determine the most efficient case of hhg at moderate laser intensity ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "for that reason we perform several 1d pic simulations with different parameters .",
    "finally , we analyze the obtain results and define different regimes of hhg .    in the last section of the paper we consider the nanobunches moving and radiating in forward direction .",
    "for our simulations we use the one - dimensional version of the vlpl pic code @xcite . in our geometry , the incident wave comes from the left hand side of the simulation box and propagates along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "the wave is p - polarized and the electric field component oscillates along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the plasma is located at the right hand side of simulation box .",
    "it is also possible to simulate oblique incidence with our code .",
    "let @xmath22 be the angle of incidence in the laboratory frame and consider a frame moving along the @xmath21-axis with velocity @xmath23 .",
    "lorentz transformations verify that the laser is normally incident in this frame . at the same time the whole plasma moves in @xmath21-direction in the frame .",
    "thus , attributing some initial velocity to plasma in our simulation , we are working in the moving frame .",
    "if we need to get the results in laboratory frame , we have to transform the values obtained from the simulation via lorenz transformation .",
    "consequently we obtain results that correspond to the process with oblique incidence .",
    "we use the incident wave @xmath24 of duration @xmath25 , that is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( fig .",

    "[ pulse]b ) , @xmath33    assuming that the ions are at rest during the whole interaction process , we consider only the interaction between the electrons and the incident wave . in the simple case of normal incidence",
    "there are two forces acting on particles along @xmath20-axis .",
    "the electrostatic force proportional to @xmath34 and laser ponderomotive force oscillating with @xmath35 ( twice of the laser frequency ) .",

    "simulation parameters considering from the laboratory frame are : plasma density @xmath30 , @xmath29 ; laser amplitude @xmath36 .",
    "note that the values in ( b ) are transformed concerning to the moving frame .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in the case of oblique incidence of a p - polarized wave , there is going to be an additional longitudinal component of the electric field oscillating at frequency @xmath37 and acting on the plasma surface .",
    "consequently the interaction becomes even more complicated , which leads to stronger oscillations of the plasma surface containing both @xmath37 and @xmath35 modes ( fig .",
    "[ dens_comp ] ( b ) ) .    as soon as the electrons are pulled back by the electrostatic force , they form a thin nanobunch that reaches a velocity close to @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the generation of high harmonics is possible .",
    "in this section we do the first step towards our first goal described in the introduction and derive two different analytic expressions for two different cases , which roughly describe the electron density profile at the times where the sharp spikes appear .",
    "the starting point of our calculations is the approximation of the electron phase space distribution at these times .",
    "as we shall see later this distribution depends on the propagation velocity @xmath39 of the given electron layer .",

    "we assume that this curve in phase space is described by the function @xmath49 at some small interval close to the density spike . obviously , @xmath42 is the local minimum of this function that coincides with the position of the spike .",

    "for instance , if we take a look at another curve in phase space , which is enclosed by the previous one , we see that there is also a local maximum of the density at the point were the curve reaches its minimal @xmath20-value .",
    "however the electrons are more scattered ( heated ) compared to the previous case and thus the local density maximum is much smaller .",
    "the idea , that gives us the staring point for our calculations is the following one .",
