    "nonlocality , _ i.e. _ the existence of correlations which can not be explained by any local hidden variable model , is perhaps the most debated implication of quantum mechanics . during the last decade other aspects of nonlocality , in addition to generating nonlocal correlations , have been discovered .",
    "for example , the possibility of teleporting and effectively encoding information , as well as the ability to perform certain computations exponentially faster than any classical device .",
    "realistic implementations of quantum information protocols require the investigation of nonlocality properties of quantum states in a noisy environment .",
    "in particular , the robustness of nonlocality should be addressed , as well as the design of protocols to preserve and possibly enhance nonlocality in the presence of noise .",

    "@xcite we have suggested a conditional measurement scheme on twb leading to a non - gaussian entangled mixed state , which improves fidelity of teleportation of coherent states .",
    "this process , termed inconclusive photon subtraction ( ips ) , is based on mixing each mode of the twb with the vacuum in an unbalanced beam splitter and then performing inconclusive photodetection on both modes , _ i.e. _ revealing the reflected beams without discriminating the number of the detected photons .",
    "ips states have the following properties : they improve the teleportation fidelity for coherent states @xcite and show enhanced nonlocal correlations in the phase space @xcite in ideal conditions , namely in the absence of noise .",
    "motivated by these results and by the recent experimental generation of ips states @xcite , in this paper we extend the previous studies on the twb and consider the nonlocality of the ips state in the presence of noise .",

    "<S> we address nonlocality of continuous variable systems in the presence of dissipation and noise . </S>",
    "<S> three nonlocality tests have been considered , based on the measurement of displaced - parity , field - quadrature and pseudospin - operator , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocality of twin - beam has been investigated , as well as that of its non - gaussian counterparts obtained by inconclusive subtraction of photons . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that : i ) nonlocality of twin - beam is degraded but not destroyed by noise ; ii ) photon subtraction enhances nonlocality in the presence of noise , especially in the low - energy regime . </S>"
