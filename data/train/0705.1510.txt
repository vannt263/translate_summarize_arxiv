    "much of the recent interest in schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) stems from the description it offers of cluster boundaries in critical statistical mechanics models .",
    "these models are conjecturally described by conformal field theories , which determines expectation values of products of local operators . however , non - local objects such as cluster boundaries do not have a natural expression in the field theory language .",
    "these curves are of great interest as , for example , they describe percolation cluster boundaries , level lines of height models and spin cluster boundaries .",
    "recently , the scaling limit of the spin cluster boundary in the ising model with appropriate boundary conditions has been proven to be sle with @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the ising model corresponds to the @xmath2-state potts model with @xmath3 .",
    "we may ask , therefore , whether spin boundaries in the critical potts model with other values of @xmath2 have sle as their scaling limit . the fortuin - kastelyn ( fk ) cluster representation  @xcite of the potts model contains closed loops which may be taken to be the contours of a suitably defined height model .",
    "the scaling limit of this model is supposed to be a field theory ( cft ) called the coulomb gas which possesses a single parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "the connection with sle is that the winding angle of these loops in the coulomb gas are equivalent to that seen in radial sle for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we have reason to believe that the fk cluster boundaries should correspond to sle in the scaling limit , with @xmath7    the spin cluster boundaries are related to these fk cluster boundaries in a non - trivial way , however , and it is therefore interesting to investigate the properties of these spin boundaries in the scaling limit . for the ising model , these spin cluster boundaries are also described by sle at the dual value @xmath8",
    "@xcite .",
    "besides @xmath9 ( corresponding to percolation ) , there are two other integer values of @xmath2 for which the potts model displays a continuous phase transition : @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 the transition is first order ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the case @xmath10 and test for agreement of numerically simulated lattice spin cluster boundaries with known predictions of sle .",
    "the dual value of @xmath13 for @xmath10 is , from equation  [ eqnkappa ] above , @xmath14 .",
    "we may hypothesise , therefore , that the spin cluster boundaries , properly defined , of the @xmath10 potts model are sle with @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is a numerical investigation of that prediction .",
    "the set - up of chordal sle requires that the curves connect fixed points on the boundary of a simply connected domain .",
    "this is ensured by careful choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "for example , consider the following boundary conditions for the ising model : divide the boundary into two connected subsets ( ` left ' and ` right ' ) .",
    "let the left boundary spins be spin up and the right boundary spins be spin down .",
    "this ensures that a spin cluster boundary runs from one fixed point on the boundary to another , for every configuration of the bulk spins .",
    "the gibbs distribution induces a measure on these curves .",
    "the case of the @xmath10 potts model is similar , although there are now two types of interesting boundary conditions .",
    "if the boundary conditions are chosen as for the ising model , with those on the left part being of spin type  @xmath15 ( say ) and those on the right of spin type @xmath16 , the right boundary curve of the cluster connected to the boundary spins of type  @xmath15 does not everywhere coincide with the right boundary curve of those of type  @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , the spin cluster boundary may split around regions of spin type  @xmath17 , which themselves may contain islands of the other spin types , ad infinitum .",
    "one possibility for the scaling limit is that the two cluster boundaries are distinct , with probability one .",
    "this might then be expected to correspond to two - curve sle .",
    "we therefore simulate numerically a set of samples with these boundary conditions and compare to predictions from two - curve sle : the fractal dimensions and the formulae describing the expected spatial distribution of the curves in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "the other choice for boundary conditions is to fix the left set of the boundary spins to be of type  @xmath15 and to allow those on the right to fluctuate between the other two spin types . in this case",
    ", we may consider the right boundary of the cluster connected to the boundary spins of type  @xmath15 , which forms a curve connecting the two fixed points on the boundary .",
    "the measure on this set of curves is , as before , induced by the gibbs distribution .",
    "we also simulate potts models with these boundary conditions to test against two predictions of single - curve sle : the fractal dimension and schramm s formula . for the single curve case",
    ", we also examine the statistics of the driving function by undoing the sequence of conformal transformations which uniquely determine the form of the curve through the loewner equation .",
    "this driving function should be brownian motion with diffusivity @xmath13 if the curves correspond to sle .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section  [ secpotts ] , we summarise the definition and important features of the potts model , explaining in detail the boundary conditions required to generate cluster boundaries . in section  [ secsle ] , we recall the definition of sle and describe the predictions of sle which we will test our samples against . in section  [ secsimulations ]",
    "we describe the details of the numerical simulations we performed , explaining how the fractal dimension and other data are extracted from the generated samples . in section  [ secresults ] , we present the results of our numerical simulations and conclude in section  [ secsummary ] .",
    "the appendix contains details of the wolff algorithm used for all simulations .",
    "the @xmath2-state potts model is a lattice spin model .",
    "the spins may take values from the set @xmath18 and have nearest neighbour interactions , such that the partition function takes the form @xmath19 @xmath20 is the reduced coupling constant and @xmath21 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the case @xmath3 is equivalent to the ising model , up to a constant . for @xmath22 , therefore , the potts model describes a generalisation of the ising model to systems with more than two spin types . for a given @xmath23 and choice of lattice ,",
    "there exists a value of the coupling constant , @xmath24 , at which the model has a continuous transition ; the two point correlation function of the spins decays as a power law and the scaling limit of the model is supposed to be described by a conformal field theory . for later reference ,",
    "these values for the two lattice types considered in this work are  @xcite    * square lattice @xmath25 . *",
    "triangular lattice @xmath26 .",
    "let us consider spin cluster boundaries in the ising model arising from a specific choice of boundary conditions .",
    "namely , let those spins on a connected piece of the boundary be of spin type  @xmath15 and elsewhere on the boundary , the spins be of type  @xmath16 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ figisbound ] , where spin type  @xmath15 is represented by the colour red and type  @xmath16 spins are coloured green .",
    "then , for every configuration of the spins in the bulk , there exists a unique curve starting and ending at two fixed points on the boundary . immediately to one side of the curve , all the spins are green . to the other side ,",
    "the spins are red .",
    "the measure on these curves is derived from the gibbs distribution .",
    "let us consider how to define the boundary conditions for the @xmath10 potts model in such a way as to guarantee the existence of cluster boundary curves propagating through the sample .",
    "the natural extension of the boundary conditions for the ising model is to fix a connected set of the boundary spins to be of ( say ) spin type  @xmath15 ( red or dark grey on black and white printouts ) , with the remaining spins of type @xmath17 ( blue or black ) , as in figure  [ figq3bbound ] .",
    "the particular choice of spins is , of course , arbitrary due to the @xmath27 symmetry of the model .",
    "we shall refer to these boundary conditions as ` fixed ' boundary conditions .",
    "however , the situation is different from the ising model , since in this case the boundary curve of the cluster containing the red boundary spins does not always coincide with the boundary of the cluster containing the blue boundary spins . in the figure ,",
    "the dotted line is the boundary of the cluster containing the blue boundary spins , the dashed line is the boundary of the cluster containing the red boundary spins and where the two curves are both present along an edge , a thick black line has been drawn .",
    "this black line is reminiscent of the single cluster boundary in the ising model , with spins immediately to one side of it red and those on the other side being blue , but the dotted and dashed lines are of a new type .",
    "the dotted line has blue spins to one side and either green ( light grey on black and white printouts ) or red to the other .",
    "the dashed line has red spins to one side and either green or blue to the other side . in this paper",
    ", we shall refer to the thick black lines as the ` composite ' cluster boundaries and the dashed and dotted lines as the ` split ' cluster boundaries .",
    "note that the ` composite ' cluster boundary splits into two ` split ' cluster boundaries whenever it encounters a vertex with all three spin types , and that a pair of ` split ' cluster boundaries recombine only at such three spin vertices .",
    "there exists another choice of boundary conditions for the @xmath10 potts model which we will refer to as ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions .",
    "a connected set of the boundary spins are set to be of spin type @xmath15 ( red ) .",
    "the remaining boundary spins are allowed to fluctuate with the spins in the bulk , but are not permitted to be of type  @xmath15 .",
    "they are therefore of type  @xmath16 ( green ) or @xmath17 ( blue ) , see figure  [ figq3bound ] .",
    "the cluster boundary of the red spin cluster connected to the top edge now coincides with the boundary of a cluster comprised of green and blue spins connected to the bottom edge , which is defined as follows : replace all green and blue spins with a new spin type @xmath28 and consider the boundary of the cluster of @xmath28 spins connected to the bottom edge . that these two cluster boundaries always coincide",
    "may be readily seen by analogy with configurations of the ising model with spin types red and @xmath28 .",
    "the reader will note the lack of reflection symmetry in the boundary conditions .",
    "this may be expected to lead to non - reflection symmetric spin cluster boundary curves",
    ". however , we shall present evidence that these curves are actually reflection symmetric in the scaling limit .",
    "we expect the cluster boundary curves of critical statistical models to be described by measures which are invariant under conformal transformations , due to the conformal invariance of the action associated to these models .",
    "this argument can be made more precise ; the changes in boundary conditions described in the previous section have been shown  @xcite to be produced by the insertion of boundary @xmath29 operators in the appropriate conformal field theory .",
    "expectation values of observables therefore correspond to correlation functions with a pair of these boundary condition changing operators inserted .",
    "it may be shown , for a specific choice of observables , that the partial differential equations for these correlation functions arising from the null state associated with the @xmath29 operators are the same as those coming from the mathematical theory of random curves with conformally invariant measure , known as schramm loewner evolution ( sle ) .",
    "let us summarise the main features of the theoretical physicist s version@xcite of sle .",
    "a curve in the upper half plane from the origin to infinity is considered as being grown dynamically as a function of time @xmath30 , which therefore parameterizes distance along the curve .",
    "let @xmath31 be the set consisting of the curve as grown up to time @xmath30 ( as well as all points enclosed by the curve and between the curve and the real axis ) so that the complement of this set in the upper half plane is simply connected .",
    "let @xmath32 be the ( unique ) conformal mapping of this complement to the whole upper half plane , normalised such that @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath35 term is increasing with @xmath30 , so ` time ' can be reparametrised such that this coefficient is exactly @xmath36 .",
    "then , @xmath30 is known as the capacity .",
    "the image of the growing tip of the curve under @xmath37 is a point @xmath38 on the real axis .",
    "loewner showed that the time - evolution of @xmath37 satisfies a differential equation , which is named after him : @xmath39 any suitably continuous function @xmath38 generates a curve .",
    "schramm@xcite showed that for this process to generate a conformally invariant measure on curves , the driving function must be @xmath40 , with @xmath41 being a standard brownian motion .",
    "there remains a single parameter in the theory , @xmath13 , which is the diffusivity of the brownian motion . a small value of @xmath13 results in a measure which favours curves with few turns , whereas a large value of @xmath13 leads to a measure favouring curves which wind more frequently , touching themselves and the real axis .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is conjecturally related to the central charge of the conformal field theory it describes via the formula : @xmath42 from this formula , it is clear that the central charge associated to an sle with diffusivity @xmath13 is equal to that of the dual sle with @xmath8 .",
    "we will now describe some properties of sle curves .      if @xmath43 is the number of discs of radius @xmath44 required to cover an object , this number scales as @xmath45 for small @xmath44 , where the exponent @xmath46 is known as the fractal dimension .",
    "sle curves are fractal objects , with @xmath47    the total length of the curve , @xmath48 , measured in units of the lattice spacing , @xmath49 , obeys a scaling relation as a function of system size , @xmath50 , as @xmath51 @xmath52      schramm s formula relates to the following question : given an sle connecting two boundary points , what is the probability that the curve passes to one side of a point , @xmath53 , in the interior ? if the domain is mapped to the upper half plane such that the sle connects @xmath54 to @xmath55 , this probability may be expressed as the solution to a second order partial differential equation .",
    "let us consider the probability that the curve passes to the left of a point , @xmath56 . by this",
    "we mean that there is a continuous path from the point to the positive real axis which does not intersect the sle curve .",
    "the solution is found by applying appropriate boundary conditions to the solution to the differential equation , which is a function only of @xmath57 due to the conformal invariance of the measure :    @xmath58    the two domains considered in this work are related to the upper half plane by simple transformations , hence this result may be re - expressed easily in terms of the conventional coordinates in these domains .",
    "the generalisation of this result to the two - sle case , was the subject of a recent paper@xcite .",
    "given a pair of sles both connecting @xmath54 to @xmath55 in the upper half plane , there are three possibilities : an interior point , @xmath53 , may be to the left of both curves , between them or to the right hand side of both .",
    "there is a probability for the curve to belong to each class , which is a function only of @xmath59 , just as for the single curve case .",
    "the probability of each class obeys a third order linear partial differential equation , with solutions which are integrals of hypergeometric functions .",
    "the particular solution of interest is found by imposing a natural set of boundary conditions , namely the asymptotic behaviour as the point approaches the positive and negative real axis .",
    "the solutions are    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62\\,.\\ ] ] the probability that the curves are both to the right of a point may be deduced from the other two cases . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall refer to these equations as the two - curve formulae .",
    "as for the single curve formula , the results may be transferred to the domains of interest via a conformal transformation .",
    "consider the @xmath10 potts model with ` fixed ' boundary conditions .",
    "there are a pair of cluster boundary curves in this case , which initially overlap , taking the form of a ` composite ' cluster boundary .",
    "this may be expected to split around a cluster of spins which is not connected to the boundary .",
    "we may ask about the relevance , in a renormalization group sense , of the operator responsible for the recombination of these ` split ' curves .",
    "this operator is familiar from the height representation of the @xmath63 model , where it is known as the 4-leg operator .",
    "the scaling dimension of this 4-leg operator is @xmath64 where @xmath65 . for @xmath11 , which we do not consider in this paper ,",
    "the 4-leg operator is therefore marginal with @xmath66 , since @xmath67 in this case . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the scaling dimension is @xmath68 , which means it is irrelevant . as the system size increases , the ` split ' boundary curves are therefore expected to collide less frequently .",
    "we may expect the scaling limit in this case to correspond to a pair of non - intersecting sle curves .",
    "note that the joining of two ` split ' curves and a ` composite ' curve at a point does not correspond to the insertion of a 3-leg operator , since the two types of curves are inequivalent .",
    "indeed , we shall see that the ` composite ' curve has a different fractal dimension .",
    "we use the algorithm described in appendix  [ secwolffalgorithm ] to generate a representative set of spin configurations at the critical point of the @xmath2-state potts model for both @xmath3 and @xmath10 in two domains .",
    "the first is the square lattice on the rectangle with aspect ratio @xmath69 , the second is the triangular lattice on the disc .    as explained in section  [ secpotts ] ,",
    "if the boundary conditions for @xmath3 ( the ising model ) are chosen appropriately , a continuous boundary curve separating the two spin clusters runs between two points on the boundary .",
    "this ensemble of curves has recently been proven to converge to sle@xmath70  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a useful check to show that the set of boundary curves obtained from our algorithm for @xmath3 satisfy the expected properties of sle , as outlined in section  [ secsle ] .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to gather numerical support for the spin boundaries of the 3-state potts model with appropriate boundary conditions becoming sle in the scaling limit .",
    "there are two types of boundary conditions : ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions ( see section  [ secpotts ] ) lead to a single curve running between two boundary points . `",
    "fixed ' boundary conditions lead to a pair of ` split ' curves running between two fixed points on the boundary , which may overlap to form a ` composite ' curve . in section  [ sec4leg ]",
    "we presented an argument for only the ` split ' curves being present in the scaling limit .",
    "we test the validity of this argument by comparing the fractal dimensions of the two types of curves .",
    "the geometries chosen for the simulations are the square lattice on a narrow rectangular sample , and the triangular lattice on a disc .",
    "the first is chosen so that schramm s formula ( see section  [ subsecschramm ] ) may be compared with that on an infinite strip .",
    "the second geometry is chosen for the ease of obtaining the driving function of single curves ( see section  [ secdrivingfunction ] ) .",
    "the two are complimentary in the sense that the measure on curves in the two domains should be related by the conformal transformation between them .",
    "that critical statistical models are conformally invariant is an accepted conjecture , but this does provide another useful check of the robustness of the algorithm , as well as a further demonstration that properties of the scaling limit of the curves are consistent with those of sle .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to a technical discussion of the methods of obtaining data from the samples .      given a configuration of spins ,",
    "the first step to identifying the boundary curves is to identify the extent of the cluster containing a given boundary spin .",
    "this is done using the following algorithm :    1 .",
    "start at the boundary spin of interest , marking it as belonging to the cluster 2 .",
    "mark all neighbours if they are of the same spin type 3 .",
    "repeat step 2 for all neighbours of marked spins 4 .",
    "identify all connected sets of unmarked spins which are surrounded by a closed path of marked spins .",
    "mark all such sets of spins .",
    "this process is demonstrated in figure  [ sub - figis ] for an ising sample .",
    "it is sufficient to identify a single cluster boundary for the ising model and @xmath10 model with ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions , since the cluster boundaries of the top and bottom clusters overlap everywhere in these cases ( see section  [ secpotts ] ) . for the case",
    "@xmath10 with ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions , as in figure  [ figq3bound ] for example , the first step to identifying the mixed spin cluster boundary is to replace all blue spins throughout the sample with green spins .",
    "then , the algorithm is the same as that for the ising model .    for the @xmath10 model with",
    "` fixed ' boundary conditions , however , this process must be run twice to identify both the cluster connected to the bottom edge of the sample and that connected to the top edge , see figure  [ sub - figq3 ] .",
    "the result is figure  [ sub - figq3](f ) , which shows all three types of clusters present .",
    "note that the example figures are for the triangular lattice case . the same algorithms to determine the cluster boundaries",
    "are employed for samples generated on the square lattice .      for the ising model and the @xmath10 potts model with ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions , there is a single curve running between two fixed points on the boundary .",
    "first , identify the cluster containing one set of boundary spins , as outlined in section  [ secident ] .",
    "this results in a configuration of the type shown in figure  [ sub - figis](d ) .",
    "then , the length of the cluster boundary curve is deduced as follows .",
    "for each site on the sample , compare the colour at that site to each of its nearest neighbours .",
    "if the nearest neighbour is of the same colour ( and therefore connected to the same cluster ) there is not a cluster boundary separating the two spins .",
    "otherwise , if it is of the other colour , add one half to the total length of the cluster boundary curve ( since each link will be counted twice by this algorithm ) .",
    "the situation for @xmath10 with ` fixed ' boundary conditions involves the fractal dimension of two types of cluster boundaries : the ` composite ' cluster boundaries and the ` split ' cluster boundaries , see section  [ secpotts ] .",
    "identify the clusters containing the two types of boundary spin and also the clusters which do not contain a boundary spin .",
    "this leads to a cluster configuration similar to that shown in figure  [ sub - figq3](f ) .",
    "the total length of ` composite ' boundaries is found by summing over all sites , adding one half to a running total wherever a pink site is adjacent to a grey site .",
    "the total length of ` split ' cluster boundaries is found by identifying all sites where a grey site is adjacent to a yellow site or a pink site is adjacent to a yellow site , adding one half to a different running total for each such occurence .",
    "in this way , we may deduce the expected length of curves as a function of system size .",
    "comparison to equation  [ eqfractlength ] allows an estimation of the fractal dimension of the curves .",
    "firstly , for the ising model and @xmath10 potts model with ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions , the starting point is the cluster configuration picture , as in figure  [ sub - figis](d ) .",
    "recall that the boundary conditions are chosen such that the curve starts and ends at opposite points on the boundary .",
    "there is a path which is equidistant from these two points , which is shown in figure  [ figisrectgeom ] for the rectangle .",
    "for each site along this path , calculate the percentage of the samples for which the site is coloured cyan .",
    "this yields the fraction of samples for which this point is connected to the bottom cluster .",
    "this may be compared to the predictions of schramm s formula .    for the @xmath10 potts model with `",
    "fixed ' boundary conditions , the procedure is to deduce the cluster picture , as in figure  [ sub - figq3](f ) .",
    "two separate quantities may be measured , the percentage of the samples for which each point along the path is connected to the bottom cluster ( coloured grey ) and the percentage which are in the central , yellow cluster . in the former case , the point is to one side of both curves ( the left hand side say ) , whereas in the latter example , the points are between the two curves .",
    "these results are to be compared to the generalisation of schramm s formula to two curves , the two - curve formulae ( see section  [ subsecschramm ] ) .",
    "the third test is to analyse the driving function of the curves for the ising model and @xmath10 potts model samples with ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions .",
    "the spin boundary curves have a natural discretisation provided by the lattice itself , so a curve may be approximated by the set of ordered lattice points which it passes through .",
    "it is easiest to consider the set of conformal mappings of the curve back to the boundary in the upper half plane , so the first step is to transform domains using a conformal transformation . for the disc , for example ,",
    "this is the following mobius transformation : @xmath71 for the rectangle , the transformation to the upper half plane is not so convenient ; the derivative of the conformal map at the corners is large .",
    "the effect of this can not be simply and systematically removed .",
    "the curve grown up to a point @xmath72 may be mapped back to the real axis by a series of vertical slit maps for each successive discretized point , @xmath73 , along the curve @xmath74 this maps the point @xmath73 to @xmath75 on the real axis , which is therefore the value of the driving function , @xmath76 , at the time when this point is the tip of the growing curve .",
    "the change in @xmath30 associated with this piece of curve is found from the expansion of the map as @xmath77 : @xmath78 the change in @xmath30 is therefore @xmath79 . for sle , the driving function should be a multiple of brownian motion .",
    "in particular , the expectation value of @xmath76 should vanish and the variance should be @xmath13 . on a plot of frequency of step lengths ( normalised by @xmath80 ) the distribution should be gaussian with variance @xmath81 .",
    "our lattice curves are only supposed to approximate sle at scales much larger than the lattice spacing . therefore , effective steps equivalent to @xmath82 lattice steps are considered .",
    "@xmath83 is then the change in the driving function as a result of an effective step , and @xmath84 is the capacity change , totalled over the @xmath82 component steps .",
    "we also plot @xmath85 as a function of @xmath30 , with a view to equating the gradient to @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we present a comparison between the results from the numerical simulations and predictions from sle .",
    "the algorithm used to generate samples is described in appendix  [ secwolffalgorithm ] .",
    "this section describes the results from the ising model on the rectangle on a square lattice of aspect ratio @xmath86 .",
    "four system sizes are used : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where the lengths are in multiples of the lattice spacing .",
    "these will be referred to by their smaller dimension .",
    "the boundary conditions are as described in section  [ secpotts ] , with one spin type fixed along a long edge and half each of the shorter sides , and the other spin type elsewhere .",
    "the geometry is therefore as shown in figure  [ figisrectgeom ] .",
    "a cluster boundary curve runs from the centre of one short edge of the rectangle to the centre of the other short edge .",
    "@xmath91 independent samples of each system size are used to estimate the fractal dimension of the curves , by determining the average length as a function of system size .",
    "this process is explained in section  [ secnumfract ] .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ figisingrectfract ] .",
    "the error bars are shown , but are only just discernible at this magnification .",
    "the linear fit is in good agreement with the data , with reduced @xmath92 equal to @xmath93 .",
    "it shows a fractal dimension of @xmath94 . using formula  [ eqfract ]",
    ", this would correspond to sle with @xmath95 .",
    "the known value of @xmath0 for the ising model lies just outside these error bars .",
    "the fit to schramm s formula is via the logarithmic map from the upper half plane to the infinite strip : @xmath96 the assumption that the strip is effectively infinitely long is valid only if the boundary curve at the centre of the sample is independent of the boundary conditions at the ends of the rectangle .",
    "we tested this by generating system sizes of aspect ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the differences in the data are smaller than the error in the measurements . in terms of a coordinate , @xmath99 , which describes the fractional distance across the strip , @xmath30",
    "is given by @xmath100 in equation  [ eqschramm ] .",
    "this follows from equation  [ equhptoplane ] .",
    "the results from the numerical data are the expectation value for the point at a fractional distance @xmath99 across the strip being connected to the bottom spin cluster .",
    "figure  [ figschrammisingrect100 ] shows the comparison to the best fit value of @xmath101 .",
    "once more , the known value lies just outside this range .",
    "we should not be surprised , therefore , it the predicted value of @xmath102 for @xmath10 potts model also lies just outside the range obtained from the numerics .",
    "the average is again over @xmath91 independent samples .",
    "the geometry is the same as for the ising model above , with sample sizes @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "first , let us examine the case of ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions , when there is a single curve connecting two boundary points at the centre of each short end of the rectangle .",
    "the boundary conditions are like those in figure  [ figisrectgeom ] except that the boundary spins on the bottom half are permitted to be either blue or green and to fluctuate with the spins in the bulk .",
    "the fractal dimension comes from the average length of the curves as a function of system size , where @xmath91 independent samples have been generated for each sample size .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig3qrectfract ] .",
    "the linear fit shows the fractal dimension to be @xmath103 , which would correspond to sle with @xmath104 .",
    "the fit to schramm s formula , figure  [ fig3qrectschramm ] , shows that on average , the curve is closer to the fluctuating spins boundary than would be expected . equivalently , a point of fractional distance @xmath105 across the sample from the fluctuating boundary towards the fixed boundary is more likely to be connected to the fixed spin cluster than would be expected from schramm s formula .",
    "perhaps this is not surprising ; whereas the two types of boundary conditions in the ising model are reflection symmetric , the boundary conditions for @xmath10 with fluctuating boundary conditions are not .",
    "it is only in the scaling limit that we might expect to recover reflection symmetry .",
    "the best fit value is @xmath106 .",
    "we shall see that this asymmetry is a result of non - zero average of the driving function , but that this effect is localised to the neighbourhood of the boundary spins , and therefore is unimportant in the scaling limit .",
    "an alternative set of boundary conditions are the ` fluctuating ' boundary conditions described in section  [ secpotts ] .",
    "these lead to the existence of two cluster boundary curves ; the boundary of the cluster containing one set of boundary spins and the boundary of the cluster containing the other boundary spins . wherever the two curves overlap , this is labelled a ` composite ' part of the curve . where they are distinct they are labelled ` split ' curves .",
    "in order to ascertain the fractal dimensions of the two types of curves , the expected total length of the two types of curves as a function of system size is plotted , see figure  [ fig3qrectcomplexsimplefract ] .",
    "@xmath107 independent samples are generated for each sample size .",
    "the fractal dimension of the ` composite ' boundary type is @xmath108 , which would correspond to sle with @xmath109 .",
    "the reduced @xmath92 of this linear fit is @xmath110 however , which is indicative of non - linearity in the results .",
    "closer investigation reveals convexity resulting from the fractal dimension diminishing as system size increases .",
    "the ` split ' boundary type has a larger fractal dimension of @xmath111 , which would result from sle with @xmath112 .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the ` split ' boundary types dominate in the scaling limit , resulting in a pair of curves running between the boundary points .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is a little surprising ; it is close to the dual value for @xmath1 , namely @xmath113 .",
    "figure  [ fig3qrect2cschramm ] shows the agreement with the generalisation of schramm s formula to two curves , again from @xmath107 independent samples .",
    "the path used is the same as for the single curve case , namely the dashed line in figure  [ figisrectgeom ] . as a function of the distance of a point upwards from the bottom boundary",
    ", we may determine the expected fraction of the samples for which both cluster boundary curves are above the point ( top figure ) and the fraction for which the point is between the two curves ( bottom figure ) .",
    "the fit to the two - curve formula is poor for the lattice sizes considered , as may have expected ; for finite lattice size , there is a non - zero contribution from ` composite ' cluster boundaries , which reduce the proportion of points which lie between the two curves and increase the proportion of points to one side of both curves as a result .",
    "the spins lie on the triangular lattice so that each spin has six nearest neighbours and the spin boundaries lie on the edges of the honeycomb lattice ( the sides of the hexagons ) .",
    "initially , four system sizes are considered , characterised by the maximum number of rows across the central vertical diameter : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "spins are included if the centre of the hexagon is a distance away from the centre of less than or equal to the radius of this vertical column .",
    "the geometry is shown in figure  [ figisdiscgeom ] with the boundary conditions used for the ising model .",
    "the fractal dimension of the curve in this geometry is @xmath118 , which would correspond to sle with @xmath119 , see figure  [ fig2qdiscfract ] .",
    "this result is obtained from @xmath120 independent samples for each system size .",
    "the fit to schramm s formula is via the mobius transformation from the upper half plane to the disc @xmath121 the value of @xmath30 in equation  [ eqschramm ] is related to the fractional distance @xmath105 upwards along the vertical diameter by the formula @xmath122 the best fit for the largest system size considered would correspond to sle with @xmath123 , as shown in figure  [ fig2qdiscschramm ] .",
    "the reason that only the largest system size is shown is that the plot is quantitatively similar for all system sizes . over",
    "the range of system sizes tested , the value of @xmath13 fluctuates around a constant value .",
    "this appears inconsistent with the hypothesis that the value should be converging to @xmath0 as system size increases , but is likely to be a result of the small range of system sizes considered .",
    "larger systems are computationally demanding to simulate , but would offer further insight into this problem .",
    "the third test against sle is to extract driving functions for each curve and to examine their statistics as a function of system size .",
    "this process is described in section  [ secdrivingfunction ] .",
    "an example , for diameter @xmath117 , is shown in figure  [ fig2qdiscstep ] .",
    "the results are from @xmath91 independent samples . for each sample ,",
    "only the part of the curve corresponding to capacity @xmath124 was used , since the error introduced by the series of conformal maps may be expected to grow exponentially .",
    "this would result in inaccurate values for the driving function from later points on the curve .",
    "the form should be gaussian , but the finite lattice is apparently responsible for a bi - modality for small steps @xmath125 .",
    "a second test is to examine the expected squared value of the driving function as a function of capacity , @xmath30 .",
    "each system size has a linear fit with a gradient which would correspond to @xmath13 .",
    "the results for diameter @xmath117 is shown in figure  [ fig2qdiscline ] .",
    "the linear fit is excellent , with reduced @xmath126 .",
    "the value of this best fit as a function of the inverse system size is plotted in figure  [ figisdisctend ] .",
    "the approach to the scaling limit appears to be complicated ; it is not a simple power law at these lattice sizes .",
    "smaller system sizes and larger numbers of independent samples are used for this test , as large numbers of samples are required to obtain results to a desirable accuracy .",
    "the table below shows the system sizes used , with the corresponding values of the inverse number of spins and number of samples generated .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ` split ' boundaries have a larger fractal dimension .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that they dominate in the scaling limit , supported by the irrelevance of the 4-leg operator .",
    "for the sample sizes considered , the agreement with the two - curve formula ( the generalisation of schramm s formula to two - curve sle ) is poor .",
    "this is unsurprising , as the presence of ` composite ' cluster boundaries reduces the frequency of points being between the two curves and redistributes this to the probability that a point is to one side of ` both ' curves .",

    "the product may be expanded into a sum of @xmath129 terms ( @xmath130 is the number of nearest neighbours ) by choosing either @xmath131 or @xmath132 from each bracket .",
    "if a line is drawn on the edge between each pair of spins for which the term @xmath132 was chosen , the partition function is seen to correspond to a sum over all graphs on the edges of the original lattice .",

    "the monte carlo algorithm used throughout to generate samples was the wolff algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it is a monte carlo algorithm with the following update procedure :    1 .   pick a lattice site at random .",
    "2 .   visit all neighbouring sites , adding them to the cluster with a probability @xmath137 if the spin is of the same type .",
    "3 .   repeat step ( 2 ) for all the newly included sites , adding their neighbours with the same probability if they are also of the same type .",
    "4 .   repeat ( 3 ) until no new sites may be added .",
    "5 .   change all spins in the cluster to a randomly chosen new spin type .",
    "there is always a sequence of single spin flips from any configuration to any other .",
    "the probability , @xmath137 , is related to the reduced coupling by ( cf equation  [ fk ] ) @xmath138 it is the conditional probability that two neighbouring spins of the same type belong to the same fk cluster .",
    "the algorithm is therefore equivalent to isolating a single fk cluster and changing all included spins to a new type .",
    "the benefit of using this algorithm is that the phenomenon of critical slowing down is eliminated .",
    "however , the average computational time required for an update increases as the critical temperature is approached due to increasing average cluster sizes .",
    "this procedure describes a single update . to generate a sample , we start with a random initial configurations of spins which are consistent with the boundary conditions",
    ". then the update algorithm is run a sufficient number of times for the energy of the system to equilibriate . in this way",

    "note that @xmath142 is also a time average .",
    "this autocorrelation function decays exponentially as @xmath143 .",
    "the correlation time , @xmath144 , is a function of system size .",
    "samples are deemed independent after 3 correlation times .    in this paper",

    "if a cluster generated by the wolff algorithm connects with such a boundary , we do not flip the spins .",
    "that is to say we ignore step ( 5 ) , thus keeping the boundary spins fixed to the only allowed type .",
    "the other choice of boundary condition considered is for the spins not to be allowed to be spin type  1 ( say ) .",
    "if a cluster generated by the algorithm connects with a boundary of this type , then the allowed spin flips in step ( 5 ) of the algorithm are constrained to not be spin type 1 . in this way , the boundary spins fluctuate with the sample , but never take the value  1 .",
