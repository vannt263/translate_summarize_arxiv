    "over the last decade , deep studies of nearby galaxies have led to the discovery of vast stellar envelopes that are often rich in substructure @xcite . these components are naturally predicted in models of hierarchical galaxy assembly and their observed properties place important constraints on the amount , nature and history of satellite accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to their very low surface brightness , one of the most effective ways of mapping the peripheral regions of galaxies is through resolved star studies .",
    "for example , dedicated surveys of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars around m31 have revealed a stellar halo extending to more than @xmath5  kpc that is dominated by tidal debris features ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarily , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has been used to explore main - sequence ( ms ) turn off stars in the halo of the milky way , leading to many discoveries of new substructures , satellites and a refined characterization of halo and thick disk properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    using wide - field cameras equipped to 8 m class telescopes , it has recently become possible to extend these studies to systems beyond the local group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "located at a distance of 3.6 mpc @xcite , m81 , is a prime target for wide - field mapping of its resolved stellar content .",
    "spectacular neutral hydrogen images have demonstrated the significant tidal interactions between m81 and its two brightest neighbors , m82 and ngc3077 , which modelling suggests have taken place in the last 300 myrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "deep photometry from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has been used to argue that the outlying hi concentrations arp s loop ( al ) , and holmbergix ( hoix ) may be tidal dwarf galaxies formed as a result of these interactions @xcite . in ngc3077 ,",
    "90% of the atomic hydrogen is located eastward of the center , in the tidal arm called  the garland \" where young stars have been observed @xcite .",
    "several other young star concentrations have been associated with peaks in the hi gas @xcite , however , the global properties of this population throughout the m81 group are still poorly known .",
    "the old stellar content around m81 has also been studied using large telescopes . @xcite found the evidence for a faint , extended structural component beyond the bright optical disk of m81 from wide - field images taken by subaru / suprime - cam .",
    "they detected no colour gradient in this structure out to 44  kpc ; @xcite used hst pointings to extend this result to 50  kpc .",

    "we observed the central region of the m81 group in the @xmath16- and @xmath17-bands using 4 pointings of subaru / hsc during the nights of january 21 and 22 , 2015 ( pi : s. okamoto ; proposal i d : s14b-101 ) with the seeing ranged from 0.6to 0.9 .",

    ", we focus on the inner @xmath7 of our survey which overlaps the sdss footprint @xcite .    the raw images were processed using the hsc pipeline ( version 3.2.2 ) , which is based on a software suite being developed for the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) project @xcite . for the processed images , the daophot in iraf",
    "was used to obtain the psf photometry of resolved stars @xcite .",
    "astrometric and photometric calibrations were done using the sdss catalog .",

    "young ms and core helium burning ( cheb ) stars in the m81 group are found .",

    "the polygon contains rsgs about 25 - 160 myr old with some contamination from galactic disk stars . above the rgb tip at @xmath37 , intermediate age ( @xmath26 0.5 - 8 gyr ) agbs are found @xcite . from the rgb tip to about 1.5 magnitude below , the blue and red rgbs boxes contain stars older than 1 gyr .",
    "we also examine the spatial distribution of bo sources .",
    "we note that the completeness of our photometry decreases towards the red , as shown by the dashed lines , so our rgb sample may be biased toward the bluer side .",

    "we also select a @xmath42 area for the se - stream between m81 and ngc3077 .",
    "young blue ms and rsg can be easily seen in the m81 cmd , as well as vast numbers of rgbs . in m82 and ngc3077 ,",
    "rgbs are prominent and some mss exist , but few if any rsgs can be seen .",
    "we note that the area within @xmath12 of each galaxy could not be resolved due to crowding , so we miss the stars of the m81 and m82 disks , and in ngc3077 center . in the se - stream ,",
    "the most luminous mss correspond to @xmath2632 myr old . in hoix ,",
    "several mss , chebs and rsgs exist .",
    "although we can not resolve rgbs at the innermost ( @xmath43 ) of hoix , the number density of rgbs in hoix are comparable to those of other regions at the same distance from m81 . therefore , as discussed by @xcite with deeper hst images , most of the old component at hoix may belong to m81 halo .",
    "figure [ fig : map ] shows the spatial distributions of hi gas @xcite , ms , cheb , rsg , agb , blue and red rgb stars , and bos defined in figure [ fig : cmd ] , without correction for the completeness and contaminants . in the upper panels ,",
    "the solid ellipses represent the @xmath12 radii of the three main galaxies .",
    "the distribution of the young populations traced by the young ms , ms+cheb and rsg stars agrees extremely well with that of the hi distribution , except for the stream at the northwest of ngc3077 where few stars are seen .",
    "the young mss are mainly concentrated in the spiral arms of m81 , at the north - west side ( hereafter nw - arm ) , al , hoix , bk3n , the garland , and se - stream .",
    "a number of small clumps are also seen as they follow hi blobs around these systems .",
    "the stellar concentration in the nw - arm was identified by @xcite and was suggested to be part of the m81 arm by @xcite .",
    "we confirm that it is connected to the stellar concentration on the north arm .",
    "the higher density regions in the se - stream have been reported either as clumps or as a dwarf galaxy ( @xmath44 ) in previous studies @xcite .",
    "as @xcite discussed , these over - densities are clearly parts of a single stream .",
    "near ngc3077 , many mss are found in the garland and up to about 8  kpc to the south and 10  kpc to the east where hi gas and dust emission have been observed @xcite . in m82 , a prominent stellar feature can be seen at @xmath45 , identified as an arc by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mss are also distributed well beyond the @xmath12 radius up to the projected distance of about 16  kpc from m82 .",
    "stars in the ms@xmath35cheb box have a very similar distribution to that of the young mss .",
    "the arc at the southeast of m82 appears to have a clumpy shape , but it is an artificial appearance due to the overlap of plotted points ( see figure [ fig : maps ] ) . interestingly , our maps show that there is another young stellar feature on the opposite side of m82 that appears to be aligned with the southern arc and may therefore be related .",
    "the selection box of ms@xmath35cheb stars includes some contamination , mainly from background blue objects , as can be seen by the low - level uniform distribution of sources through out the area . in the top - right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : map ] , the distribution of the rsgs is almost the same as that of mss and chebs .",
    "however , the fainter substructures  se - stream , m82-arc , some clumps around hoix and al , and bk3n  can not be seen in this map due to the shorter lifetime and the lower number of rsgs compared to mss .",
    "in contrast , the older populations ( agb , rgbs ) have a much smoother distribution than the younger stars .",
    "old stars are mainly embedded in the halos which reach far beyond the @xmath12 radii of three galaxies .",
    "the sizes of these rgb halos are considerable , and they may even overlap ( see figure [ fig : map_cont ] ) .",
    "while the m82 halo seems to be more extended in the blue rgb map , the halos of m81 and ngc3077 are more prominent in the red rgb map , suggesting they have a higher mean metallicity . in the contour map of red rgbs in figure [",
    "fig : map_cont ] , a tidal stream between m81 and m82 can clearly be seen , and the outer regions of m82 and ngc3077 exhibit an ",
    "s - shaped \" morphology .",
    "the dwarf galaxies ikn , bk5n , and kdg61 can not be seen in the maps of young stars , but appear as over - densities of old populations , implying they have not formed as a result of the recent interaction .    in the bottom - right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : map ] , we plot the distribution of bos at @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the uniform distribution of these sources supports their identification as contaminants , since the star / galaxy separation in our photometry degrades at magnitude fainter than about 24 mag in both @xmath16- and @xmath17-bands .",
    "we find that the young intra - group population in the m81 group traces the filamentary structures of the hi gas connecting m81 , m82 , and ngc3077 , confirming the results of several smaller field - of - view studies .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : maps ] shows the spatial distribution of stars in young ms and ms@xmath35cheb boxes of figure [ fig : cmd ] , which are color coded according to @xmath17-band magnitude in a transparent manner , so that colors of overlapping points represent the average color .",
    "bright stars are mainly located in the inner disk of m81 , while most of young stars in al , nw - arm , bk3n , garland , and other debris features are fainter than @xmath48 and have similar luminosity distributions to the se - stream , implying ages of 30 - 160 myr old .",
    "this suggests that star formation in these tidal features was synchronized , and may have stopped about 30 myrs ago .",
    "the se - stream is slightly inclined from the southeast to the northwest , whereas the tail of rgb stars in ngc3077 at the same location is extended toward the northeast - southwest .",
    "that fact that these spatial distributions do not exactly match may indicate that the se - stream comes from material torn from m81 while the rgb tail is material stripped from ngc3077 .",
    "the color of hoix is slightly greener than other clumps and streams , meaning it includes some bright ( younger ) ms stars as we see in figure [ fig : cmds ] .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : maps ] shows the color distribution of rgbs , which can be interpreted as a rough proxy for metallicity .",
    "the bluest ( index=0 ) and reddest ( index=1 ) colors correspond to @xmath25}}=-2.3 $ ] and @xmath28 , respectively , assuming 12 gyr old age .",
    "the rgbs between the solid and dashed lines of m81 , m82 and ngc3077 have the similar colors ; the medians of the color indexes are 0.41 , 0.40 , 0.46 respectively , corresponding to @xmath25}}\\sim-1.4 $ ] , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this m81 halo metallicity is slightly lower than the value of @xmath25}}\\sim-1.1 $ ] derived from previous subaru imagery and the estimation @xmath51}}=-1.2 $ ] from deep hst photometry @xcite .",
    "this might due to the missing metal - rich rgb stars in our photometry , since the completeness gets worse at redder colors .",
    "the halo of m82 has a color gradient from the inner greener area to the outer bluer region ; the greener part is also extended toward the northeast and along the direction of the young stellar arc .",
    "note that we do not correct for the internal extinction of each galaxy , so it is not possible from this study alone to determine if these are the bona fide features of the m82 halo .",
    "the tidal stream between m81 and m82 is also predominantly blue in color , indicating that this is material being stripped from m82 onto m81 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : map_cont ] and [ fig : maps ] , the ngc3077 halo is extended far beyond the @xmath12 , and has a rhombus shape stretched in the east - west direction . in the outermost region ,",
    "an s - shape distortion can be discerned , which is similar to what was found around m33 @xcite .",
    "the component in the northwest appears to reach a maximum projected radius from ngc3077 of @xmath26 65  kpc , but does not appear to trace the hi distribution in this region .",
    "the s - shaped structure is typical of an interacting dwarf galaxy with a larger companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "numerical modelling suggests the encounters between ngc3077 , m81 and m82 took place @xmath26 200 - 300 myr ago @xcite , which may not leave enough time to restore equilibrium in the ngc3077 halo .",
    "we will return to the topic of the stellar streams in the m81 group in a later paper .",
    "the close encounters between m81 , m82 and ngc3077 induced star formation in tidally stripped gas . as a consequence",
    ", new stellar concentrations were born out of these hi rich clumps , many of which lie far from the main bodies of the galaxies . of these concentrations , only al appears to have a clear counterpart in the rgb map .",
    "the presence of an older stellar component suggests that this object , like the dwarf galaxies ikn , bk5n , and kdg 61 , may not have a tidal origin .",
    "the gravitational interactions between the m81 group galaxies have also significantly perturbed their older stellar components leading to disturbed halo morphologies and giant stellar streams which appear to connect all three systems . when combined with our forthcoming hsc observations of the west side of m81",
