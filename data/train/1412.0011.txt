    "this yields simplified proofs to the classical results , and we view their value as much in this natural interpretation as in the fact that they are generalizations . indeed , this paper grew out of @xcite , in which we find a characterisation of the graphs admitting distributive lattice polymorphisms . in that paper , we found it was necessary to consider non - tight embedding of lattices into product of chains .",
    "it was then that we realized they had been largely overlooked in the literature .",
    "the point of view we develop here differs from the classical one in one point in particular .",

    "more generally , any family of sets , closed under union and intersection , is a distributive lattice under inclusion .    in @xcite , birkhoff proved a representation theorem for distributive lattices , showing that any distributive lattice @xmath0 can be represented as the inclusion lattice of a family of sets .",
