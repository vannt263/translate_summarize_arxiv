    "before the development of astronomical ccds , photoelectric detectors routinely attained photometric precision at the parts - per - thousand level.@xcite the advent of ccd cameras , by enabling simultaneous photometric measurement across the entire focal plane , opened up numerous fruitful avenues of research , notably the massive surveys of type ia supernovae that resulted in the discovery of the cosmic acceleration.@xcite . for a number of reasons , however , this new convenience and efficiency came at a cost in precision , with a typical ccd - based photometric survey achieving precision of only about 3 - 5% .",
    "such a level of precision was entirely adequate for the discovery of the dark energy  a 20% effect  but",
    "current and future attempts to use supernovae to constrain the nature of the dark energy are placing increasingly stringent demands on the calibrations that underpin these measurements @xcite current and planned surveys produce sufficient numbers of supernovae ( and photons per supernova ) that statistics no longer dominate the photometric error budget ; it is now systematic uncertainties in basic flux calibration that limit the utility of survey data.@xcite in order to move forward , ccd - based photometric technique must reclaim the precision once provided by its more primitive photoelectric ancestors .",
    "this paper outlines the nature of the precision photometry challenge in the context of type ia supernova cosmology and describes a path to the sub-1% precision regime through the use of a flux calibration approach that departs from the tradition of using celestial standards and embraces the use of well - characterized detectors as the fundamental metrologic standard .",
    "the initial evidence for the accelerating expansion of the universe was obtained from measurements of the brightness of type ia supernovae as a function of redshift.@xcite the peak brightness of these cosmic detonations ( after an empirical correction for dependence on color and rate - of - decline of the light curve ) serves as a standard candle and can therefore be converted into a distance measure called the  luminosity distance . \"",
    "the cosmological redshift , which is obtained from the wavelength shift of spectral features , provides a measure of cosmic expansion during the light travel time .",
    "combining the observed peak brightness of a supernova with its cosmological redshift provides a direct measurement of the amount of cosmic expansion since the time the light was emitted by the supernova .",
    "this relationship is often presented as a graph of luminosity distance _ vs. _ redshift called the  hubble diagram \" a graphical representation of the expansion history of the universe .",
    "distant supernovae ( at redshift z@xmath00.8 ) are roughly 20% fainter than one would expect in a critical density , matter dominated ( @xmath1=1 ) , universe ( where @xmath2 denotes dimensionless cosmic density normalized to the critical density ) .",
    "thus , the cosmic expansion is seen to be accelerating  a phenomenon presumed to be due to a still - mysterious dark energy .",
    "the initial supernova datasets that indicated a non - zero dark energy content are shown in figure [ fig : hubble ] .",
    "fainter than would be expected in a matter - dominated critical density universe ( the dashed curve ) .",
    "the orange bar corresponds to a 1% flux uncertainty , which is the calibration target for next - generation measurements to constrain the nature of dark energy .",
    "( from riess@xcite , used with permission ) .",
    "[ fig : hubble],width=576 ]    as the study of the dark energy progresses from the discovery phase to the detailed characterization phase , we face the challenge of making increasingly precise measurements of the expansion history .",
    "it is common to parameterize the relationship between the density @xmath3 and pressure @xmath4 of the various constituents of the universe ( matter , radiation , dark energy , and so forth ) in terms of an equation of state parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "measuring the equation of state parameter @xmath7 of the dark energy , and any redshift - dependence @xmath8 , is a primary objective in contemporary fundamental physics .",
    "physically , this measurement amounts to determining whether the dark energy ( or vacuum energy ) density is invariant over cosmic time , in which case @xmath9 would be constant .",
    "ascertaining whether there is any significant evidence for @xmath10 or for @xmath8 is critical to discriminating between an interpretation of dark energy as a manifestation of the cosmological constant originally envisioned by einstein , or whether we should instead attribute this effect to some other unexpected aspect of fundamental physics .",
    "the stakes are high from the perspective of fundamental physics , and our ability to continue to use type ia supernovae as a probe of the nature of dark energy depends on our ability to drive down the dominant calibration contribution to the systematic error budget .    for supernova surveys that use spectroscopic measurements to determine redshifts , the uncertainty in redshift",
    "is overwhelmed by the uncertainty in luminosity distance  which is based on flux measurements .",
    "relative flux calibration as a function of wavelength is presently the dominant source of uncertainty for using type ia supernovae as a probe of the history of cosmic expansion . in order to distinguish among different interpretations of the dark energy",
    "we will need relative flux measurements at a much improved level of precision .",
    "figure [ fig : wplot ] shows how the luminosity distance _ vs. _ redshift depends on the value of the equation of state parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this plot assumes @xmath11 and zero curvature .",
    "current data constrain the equation of state parameter to be within 10% of @xmath12 , and producing substantially more refined constraints will require flux measurements with precision of better than 1% .",
    "table [ tab : contrib ] shows the contributions of various sources of uncertainty to measurements of @xmath7 from the snls survey .",
    "notice that calibration systematics completely dominate this error budget , including contributions from uncertainties in the flux standard bd+17 and in the instrumental sensitivity function .",
    ".contribution of various sources to the uncertainty of @xmath7 , the equation of state parameter of the dark energy , for type ia supernovae .",
    "these data are taken from sullivan _",
    "et al._@xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : consistency ]    the dark energy survey has undertaken a campaign to monitor the variable aspects of atmospheric transmission ( aerosols , water vapor , ozone , and clouds ) during survey observations , as well as the survey s instrumental response function .",
    "analysis of those data is under way.@xcite comparing the results obtained with this method to more traditional photometric calibration methods will be an important step towards realizing the goal of sub - percent precision .",
    "regardless of what method is used for astronomical relative flux calibration , all extragalactic targets and most calibration stars inevitably lie both above the earth s atmosphere and behind layers of interstellar dust in the milky way . achieving sub - percent knowledge of the cosmologically relevant spectral energy distributions of these sources",
    "requires that we account for the attenuation due to both the atmosphere and the interstellar medium .",
    "the traditional definition of the luminosity of an astronomical object is the irradiance it produces at the top of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "this pragmatic definition accounts for atmospheric extinction , but ignores the effects of galactic dust , and consequently is inadequate for sub - percent photometry .",
    "it is essential to account for both .",
    "fortunately , the precision with which we must determine the attenuation due to these effects scales inversely with their severity . to achieve 1% precision in attenuation correction for a process that knocks out only 10% of the light , we need only measure the attenuation to a fractional precision of 10% .",
    "there are two traditional methods used to correct for atmospheric extinction : one is to assume that the attenuation obeys a bouguer law so that the apparent magnitude of an observed object can be extrapolated to zero airmass as its zenith angle changes through the night ; the other is to observe a calibration object at the same zenith angle and apply its observed attenuation to the object of interest .",
    "either of these methods is effective at the 10% level of precision , but pushing the the sub - percent regime requires more care .",
    "according to the bouguer law , the flux @xmath13 of a beam of light passing through the atmosphere decreases exponentially with the airmass @xmath14 of the observation .",
    "that is , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the sought - for flux of the beam at the top of the atmosphere , and @xmath17 is a wavelength - dependent factor that accounts for the specific composition of the air .",
    "the airmass @xmath14 is simply the secant of the zenith angle .",
    "thus @xmath18 ( or the apparent magnitude ) is linear in @xmath14 with intercept @xmath19 $ ] . by observing the object at various zenith angles through the night , the unattenuated ( zero airmass ) magnitude",
    "is easily extrapolated .",
    "there are two main difficulties with this technique .",
    "first is that it takes time , and during that time the characteristics of the atmosphere  as accounted for in @xmath17may well change .",
    "also , in the survey environment a source may not be monitored for long periods .",
    "the second problem is that @xmath20 changes from observation to observation , diluting the precision of comparisons from one object to another , or even for a particular object , from one observation to another . basically , for a given zenith angle , the optical depth ",
    "the product @xmath21is not really known accurately .",
    "difficulties with the use of celestial calibration sources have already been discussed . in order to account for atmospheric extinction at high precision ,",
    "we must obtain a real - time evaluation of its transmission spectrum .",
    "fortunately , certain aspects of atmospheric attenuation are deterministic , depending almost entirely on the barometric pressure at the base of the atmosphere .",
    "the basic chemical composition of atmospheric air is well known and quite stable , so it is possible to use our well - established understanding of atomic and molecular optics to model the propagation of light through it . the modtran atmospheric modeling computer code@xcite has been successful in performing this feat and is widely used in the remote sensing community .",
    "some aspects of the atmosphere are non - deterministic and time - varying , however .",
    "there is weather , after all .",
    "non - deterministic atmospheric attenuation processes include    1 .",
    "scattering from aerosols in the atmosphere , where the dependence of scattering cross section on wavelength is determined by both the shape and size distribution of the particles , 2 .",
    "absorption by water vapor along the line of sight , which occurs at discrete wavelengths that are often saturated with an airmass dependence that does not obey the bouguer law , 3 .",
    "attenuation due to ozone in the upper atmosphere , and 4 .   scattering by ice and water particulates in clouds .",
    "numerous researchers are developing methods of real - time direct measurement of atmospheric attenuation , including the use of lidar @xcite , differential gps water vapor detection @xcite , and various balloon,@xcite rocket,@xcite and satellite - borne@xcite calibrated sources observed from the ground .",
    "a full description of these efforts is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that the lsst project has dedicated @xcite a 1.5 meter class telescope to this task .",
    "the precise measurement of the apparent magnitudes of extragalactic sources requires a correction for galactic extinction .",
    "this correction clearly requires knowledge of the wavelength - dependent scattering cross section along any given line of sight . in this case",
    "we do nt have the ability to modulate the line of sight through the attenuating medium , as can be done for atmospheric attenuation .",
    "the dust in the milky way scatters light at optical wavelengths , and emits blackbody radiation with an effective temperature of around 20 k. so we can use a combination of emission and attenuation data to constrain the amount of galactic extinction along any line of sight .",
    "early work@xcite used the iras infrared survey to produce an all - sky map of galactic extinction using infrared emission .",
    "more recent 3d dust maps were produced using the observed perturbation of the apparent colors of stars.@xcite using the background density of galaxies to map out large scale structure in the universe requires that we know how to properly correct for extinction in the milky way , and the determination of photometric redshifts similarly requires correcting the colors of galaxies for the spectral distortion ( `` reddening '' ) due to milky way dust .",
    "systematic errors from relative flux calibration prevent our making full use of increased catalogs of type ia supernovae . identifying and overcoming the multiple sources of systematic error seems entirely tractable , as evidenced by the ability of numerous projects to make differential astronomical flux measurements at precisions better than a part per thousand . new techniques for characterizing the response of instruments , and careful corrections for atmospheric and galactic attenuation are integral parts of this endeavor .",
    "by pursuing a combination of techniques , including the use of da white dwarf stars as celestial standards in conjunction with calibrated photodiodes as terrestrial standards , we can assess our progress in suppressing systematic errors as we enter the sub - percent regime .",
    "the  precision frontier\"@xcite in astronomy is ripe for progress .",
    "ongoing efforts include the following .    * the access suborbital rocket payload will connect@xcite nist photodiode calibration to bright stars . *",
    "wide - field photometric survey systems have installed progressively more sophisticated instrumentation both to monitor atmospheric transmission and to map out the response functions of their instruments . *",
    "combined analysis of planck , gaia , panstarrs , skymapper , and dark energy survey data have led to improved constraints on galactic extinction .",
    "* wide field surveys such as des , lsst , and wfirst are pushing to implement improved precision for flux calibration .",
    "we look forward to a decade of continual progress in achieving improved precision in relative astronomical flux calibration , with a commensurate improvement in our ability to constrain the nature of the dark energy .",
