    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have become important members of our extragalactic zoo . since @xcite showed that the central surface brightness limit of @xmath6   in spirals claimed by @xcite was just a selection effect due to the narrow surface brightness sensitivity of photographic plates , the discovery of lsb galaxies in huge numbers in the universe gave rise to a new field of study in astronomy : the low surface brightness universe . since then , a wealth of observational data @xcite and theoretical work @xcite has been invested not only to describe the most relevant features of these galaxies , but also to analyze whether these features are consistent with models of galaxy formation and evolution . in the observational front",
    ", lsb galaxies have been investigated in the optical @xcite in the near - ir @xcite , in radio wavelengths , including studies of the hi distribution @xcite , detected and mapped in co @xcite , and also studied spectroscopically @xcite , including the analysis of rotation curves @xcite and the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "these references strongly indicate that lsb galaxies are unevolved systems with low stellar formation rate ( sfr ) , low metallicity , small stellar density , relatively high gas fractions and , from dynamical information , large amounts of dark matter",
    ". however , several challenging questions still remain .",
    "first , in spite of the evidence indicating that lsb galaxies are young when compared with spectrophotometric models , the spread in color is wide , implying that they have probably gone through diverse evolutionary paths .",
    "moreover , the fact that only small amounts of blue stars are needed to make bluer the integrated colors , due to the small stellar density , makes some lsbs appear spuriously younger than they really are . or , equivalently ,",
    "small changes in the sfr make galaxies look much younger what they actually are .",
    "second , while emission line analysis of a few spectra of lsb galaxies have revealed the metallicity of the current _ gas phase _",
    "@xcite , the metallicity of the _ underlying stellar population _ ,",
    "as measured for example using absorption lines , has not been possible to be determined , except in some few cases @xcite .",
    "third , the total stellar mass of lsb galaxies is still poorly estimated , mostly due to the large uncertainties in the stellar mass - to - light ratios at optical wavelengths .",
    "only recently , less scattered m / l ratios have been derived using near - ir bands , where the extinction due to dust has a smaller effect than in optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "finally , recent modeling of lsb galaxies predict that , under the assumption that blue lsb galaxies are currently undergoing a period of enhanced stellar formation , _ there should exist _ a population of _ red _ , non bursting , quiescent lsb galaxies @xcite .    in the context of the old stellar content of disk and lsb galaxies ,",
    "the bulge or nuclear component plays a fundamental role as it also affect any analysis where rotation curves are studied @xcite .",
    "although by the proper hubble morphological definition late type spirals tend to be bulgeless , recent studies with the hst have shown that many late type , face - on spirals apparently bulgeless , have in fact small , tiny bulge @xcite missed by studies where the spatial resolution was not good enough to resolve such small bulges .",
    "one of the recurrent questions is whether many of these bulges hosted by lsb galaxies or disks with low stellar density , are in fact high surface brightness bulges embedded in lsb disks .",
    "in such a case the bulge could evolve independently with respect to the disk , and one should expect that bulges in lsb disks present more or less the same metallicity than bulges of hsb galaxies .    on the other hand , the secular evolution of galaxies , i.e. the idea that the bulge is formed from disk evolution , allowing the direct formation of bulges from disks in isolated galaxies , implies that the stellar population of disks are similar to those in bulges .",
    "for example , one can expect that color gradients are less violent , or even inverse ( red to blue , from the center to the outskirt of the galaxy ) .",
    "also , one can expect that light profiles are fitted only by a combination of exponential profiles , instead of the classic de vaucouleurs + exponential profile @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "secular evolution could produce what is called a pseudobulge , structurally similar to a bulge , although more comparable to disk when its stellar population is analyzed and/or its light and color profile is studied .    in this paper",
    "we explore possible evolutionary scenarios for a set of selected face - on spirals and lsb galaxies , using a combination of optical and near - ir colors .",
    "in particular , we investigate the observables and structural parameters in scope of the secular disk to bulge evolution , as stated for example in @xcite .",
    "most galaxies investigated here are face - on _ nucleated _ lsb galaxies ; all of them are part of the catalogue published by @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the stellar content of the bulges .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine what ranges of metallicities and ages are consistent with bulge and disk formation scenarios , by comparing observed @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitudes and colors with spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution .",
    "we have selected a subsample with prominent bulges , for which we have carefully studied their structural parameters ( bulge and disk scale lengths , surface brightnesses ) . for this subsample ,",
    "we present radial brightness profiles and color gradients , both in optical and near - ir bands .",
    "secular evolution is analyzed in scope of these results . in ",
    "2 the sample selection is presented .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present results and a basic analysis . in  5 we present a discussion in scope of the bulge formation in hsb and lsb galaxies .",
    "we conclude in  6 .",
    "galaxies presented here were originally selected from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the sample includes galaxies with @xmath7 , with hi masses such that @xmath8 , and with dec @xmath9 deg , covering all ra .",
    "our sample includes not only lsb galaxies , but hsb galaxies as well .",
    "this allows to generate a continuous sequence for properties derived for lsb galaxies and hsb galaxies , like colors , structural parameters , etc . @xcite .",
    "the total original catalogue amounts 107 galaxies which satisfy these constraints .",
    "77 galaxies were already observed in the near - ir at las campanas observatory between 1999 and 2000 .",
    "observations and reductions for this data set are described in @xcite . from these 77 galaxies with near - ir photometry , 55 galaxies were observed during photometric nights in @xmath0 ( johnson ) and @xmath1 ( cousins ) . in this paper , we focus our attention on a subsample of 21 face - on nucleated galaxies out of these 55 spirals . in order to prevent undesirable strong internal reddening due to the effect of inclination , we have selected only face - on nucleated spirals ( defined following hubble morphological classification scheme ) for which we were interested to reach faint isophotes to @xmath10 .",
    "the face - on criteria is defined such that galaxies are spirals with inclinations smaller than 20 deg deg .",
    "this turns its disk surface brightness about @xmath11 = 0.37 $ ] magnitudes fainter , at most . ] .",
    "in fact , the combined optical and near - ir imaging @xcite allow us to select galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "the 21 spirals exhibit central surface brightnesses between 21 and 23 , in the @xmath0 band , allowing to reach the desirable central surface brightness limit .",
    "figure [ mosaics ] shows an optical mosaic of the 21 galaxies selected for the main part of this study .",
    "note that all galaxies present bulges .",
    "also note that 6 galaxies are barred .",
    "optical observations were strictly performed during photometric nights in three runs at las campanas observatory , using the 2.5 m du pont telescope .",
    "the first two runs took place in april and august 2000 , and the third one was in april 2002 . in all of them we used the same detector : a 2048@xmath122048 tek#5 ccd of 0.259 arcsec / pixel scale and 8.8 arcmin fov .",
    "the ccd present low read out noise ( 4.2 e@xmath13 ) at a gain of 3.0 e@xmath13/adu .",
    "typical exposures were between 800 and 1200 secs , splitted in two exposures per galaxy per filter .",
    "typical seeing was around 0.9 and 1.2 arcsec in the @xmath0 band , and 0.8 and 1.0 arcsec in the @xmath1 band .      with the purpose of obtaining an acceptable accurate photometry for our sample ,",
    "it is important to reduce very carefully our set of images .",
    "special attention was taken in the flat - fielding process and fringing corrections , particularly in the @xmath1 band .",
    "in fact , low ( flat ) and high ( fringes ) frequency spatial variations can introduce a spurious systematic signal over the ccd that affects the surface brightness estimate of our galaxies . in order to reduce as possible these kind of effects , we build - up a super flat for each filter from observations , especially in @xmath1 , where fringes dominate the spatial signal variations at high frequencies . a fourier transform of the images",
    "allows to detect the most common spatial patterns . also , and before flat - fielding , images were cleaned - up from cosmic rays , bad pixels and dead columns .",
    "images were finally aligned pixels ) between consecutive exposures to allow for photons of the same source to fall into different pixels . ] and averaged .      after removing instrumental effects and pixel to pixel variations , images were photometrically calibrated . the usual method based on observation of landolt standards @xcite",
    "we observed no less than 15 standards per night , allowing to derive accurate zero points and color terms for our transformation equations @xmath14 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the calibrated magnitudes in the standard system ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the instrumental magnitudes ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the photometric zero points ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the atmospheric extinction coefficients ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the measured airmasses at the moment of the observation ; and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the first order color terms .",
    "all photometric reductions were performed with the iraf photcal package .    solving the two above equations independently for each night it is possible to determine the photometric quality of each night .",
    "the corresponding coefficients for each run are presented in table [ phot_coefs ] .",
    "errors of aperture photometry were computed using the standard rules of error propagation from original measured fluxes , taking into account the s / n ratio of the different stars and galaxies and also the detector features ( read out noise and gain ) . in the error propagation",
    "we also take into account the effect of the various steps involved within the image reduction process ( bias subtraction , flat field division , summing , etc ... ) .",
    "the calibration for the corresponding @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitude for each galaxy was already presented in @xcite .",
    "table [ magnitudes ] present @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes for all spirals in the sample ( from which a subsample of 21 face - on nucleated galaxies is taken , denoted as bold - face identifications ) .",
    "magnitudes are calculated for the inner 2 kpc diameter , which is estimated using the radial velocity of each galaxy and the diameter angular relation with a hubble constant h@xmath25 of 75 km sec@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "considering the typical size of the galaxies ( see next section ) , we estimate that inside the inner 2 kpc radius we are including the typical bulge population . along with the atmospheric extinction correction ,",
    "we have applied to all images galactic extinction corrections using the maps of @xcite .",
    "structural parameters are consistently computed using the light profiles in the four bands @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these are derived using ellipse ( iraf ) , which provide azimuthally averaged isophotes for each galaxy . from these values",
    "one can derive fitting parameters for both the bulge and disk components simultaneously @xcite . from the isophote level we derive exponential profiles of the form @xmath26 where the structural parameters defining these profiles are @xmath27 , the surface brightness at @xmath28 , in l@xmath29 pc@xmath30 ; and @xmath31 , the scale length of the bulge or disk , i.e. , the radius at which we have @xmath32 times the central intensity . transforming equation [ exp_profile ] to a logarithmic scale we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the central surface brightness in   for the disk , and",
    "@xmath35 is the radial distance to the azimuthally averaged isophote . for the bulge component",
    "it is also common to use the @xmath36 profile law in the form @xmath37 , \\label{old_profile}\\ ] ] to fit the bulges of all kind of spiral galaxies ( as they were similar to elliptical galaxy profiles ) , where @xmath38 is the surface brightness at @xmath39 , the so - called effective radius containing half of the galaxian light .",
    "in fact , we do know that the exponent of the fit is correlated with the morphological type : light profiles of ellipticals and s0s follow the @xmath36 law @xcite , and bulges of sa and sb fit better to @xmath40 profiles @xcite .",
    "we use the task nfit1d in stsdas / iraf to fit two exponential ( and @xmath36 ) profiles for the whole light curve , using a @xmath41 minimization algorithm .",
    "light profiles errors are related to the corresponding errors in the fitting parameters .",
    "these errors are derived from usual @xmath41 minimization . in turn",
    ", each isophote has an associated error given by the ratio between the root - mean - square scatter around the isophotal intensity and the square root of the total pixels included in the isophote .",
    "table [ structural_parameters ] shows optical structural parameters measured for the sample of 21 spirals .",
    "table [ structural_parameters_ir ] shows the corresponding parameters measured from the near - ir brightness profiles .",
    "parameters include central surface brightnesses and scale lengths for both the bulge and the disk in the four bands .",
    "note that 38% of our sample is composed by bonna fide lsb spirals ( fainter than 22.0 ) , and the rest are in fact hsb spirals .",
    "this is useful to clearly determine what properties in spirals suffer a continuous transition to the lsb regime and which do not . in particular",
    ", we are interested on colors and light profiles for our sample , since its behavior is one of the diagnosis for a bulge / disk evolution ( see  5 ) .    in this work",
    ", all disks are fitted better by an exponential profile of the form given by equation [ exp_profile ] , or equivalently by its logarithmic version given by equation [ exp_prof_log ] , from where the central surface brightness of the disk is computed . for bulges ,",
    "the usual method is to use a @xmath36 profile ( or de vaucouleurs profile ) .",
    "however , we shall demonstrate that most of our galaxies are better fitted by a combination of _ two _ exponentials : one for the disk and one for the bulge .",
    "figure [ profiles ] shows the surface brightness profiles and color gradients in @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the 21 galaxies selected for the bulge analysis .",
    "figure [ near_ir_profiles ] present the corresponding near - ir surface brightness profiles and color gradients .",
    "names are correlative to the @xcite catalogue .",
    "dashed lines represent exponential fits , using equation [ exp_prof_log ] . in figure [ profiles ] , we include the fitted parameters @xmath34 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , expressed in , and @xmath31 , the scale length , expressed in kpc .",
    "vertical lines in the panels of color gradients , represent approximated boundaries for _ pure _ bulge and disk components , computed visually .",
    "light and color profiles extend up to the radius where the 1@xmath42 isophote is reached . for 16 out of 21 galaxies",
    "the bulge component can be fitted in the optical by an exponential profile ( equation [ exp_profile ] ) instead than a de vaucouleurs profile ( equation [ old_profile ] ) . in the near - ir , 14 out of 21 galaxies ,",
    "are well fitted by two exponentials .",
    "the radius separating the bulge and the disk components is estimated visually , and then computed using a simultaneous exponential fit for the bulge and the disk .",
    "note that 5 galaxies which are better fitted in the optical by exponential profiles are however better fitted by @xmath36 profiles in the near - ir .",
    "also note that some galaxies with good fits in the near - ir are not fitted in the optical neither by an exponential neither an @xmath36 profile ( see below ) .    in most cases ,",
    "a fit using the @xmath36 law was unsatisfactory for the central part of the galaxies .",
    "this functional form gives overestimates the bulge central brightness @xmath34(bulge ) , as has been noted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the exponential fit gives better results for our sample of galaxies .",
    "five galaxies present no definite optical detection for the disk , and therefore no fitting was possible . for galaxy 473 , no acceptable fit was possible to obtain in these bands . for galaxy 264",
    "we were unable to derive a good fit in @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the bulge component .",
    "it is also possible to appreciate for some cases the `` flattening '' effect in the central zone of the fittings , due to the seeing effect .",
    "this effect , however , is so small that it does not change our results .",
    "in this section we present and discuss the color - magnitude and the color - color diagrams .",
    "we also use some measured structural parameters which help to study stellar populations in the bulge of our sample galaxies , and analyze possible secular evolution of the galaxies .",
    "we also discuss light and color profiles in optical and near - ir bands .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained for hsb galaxies by other authors .",
    "morphological classification is important because it links those features observed locally with those observed at high-@xmath43 .",
    "@xcite showed that bluer , gas rich galaxies are more irregular compared to those with lower fractions of hi .",
    "figure [ color_mag_br ] show that the 21 face - on nucleated galaxies selected are in fact brighter and generally redder than most of the rest of the sample .",
    "it is also true that , concerning light emitted by stars , bluest galaxies have the lowest absolute magnitudes ( figure [ color_mag_br ] ) , a trend largely observed in the universe and the first indication that ( 1 ) most of the light emitted by very blue galaxies does not come from their continuum stellar emission but from the gas emission , and ( 2 ) they present generally an irregular morphology .",
    "we note that we have indirectly excluded in our sample dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) and dwarf ellipticals ( de ) . although these galaxies ( especially dsph ) present in general low surface brightnesses and red colors , these are not present in our sample , since ours is selected from the impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) catalog , which lack these types of galaxies .",
    "we recall that the impey catalogue of spirals was built mainly from the apm catalogue @xcite , which in fact lack dsph and other kind of red but faint galaxies .",
    "however , we have checked that the luminosity of bulges hosted by spirals is wide , and the sample include all the hubble classification for normal spirals ( from sa to late sc ) .      here we discuss some structural parameters for the 21 face - on nucleated spirals ( figure [ mosaics ] ) .",
    "brightness profiles and color gradients are presented in figure [ profiles ] ( optical bands ) and figure [ near_ir_profiles ] ( near - ir ) .",
    "figures [ mu_h ] and [ mu_mu ] show that our sample follows the same trends observed by the galaxies of @xcite , showing that we have not selected spirals with very bright bulge surface brightness ( note the outlier lsb 264 with @xmath44 , with a large central region compared to the disk , see figure 1 ) . from figure [ mu_mu ]",
    "it is clear that galaxies with brighter bulges have brighter disk surface brightness .",
    "the range of bulge surface brightness is consistent with the fact that the original sample from the impey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) catalogue ( which selects galaxies from the apm survey ) includes the total range of spiral galaxies , from sa to late sc .",
    "we note that our sample of 21 galaxies is in any case a complete sample : these are simply the number of galaxies from our sample with valid @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry which are oriented face - on .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ br_mu ] shows the inner 2 kpc @xmath45 color as a function of the disk central surface brightness .",
    "this figure shows that there is no bias or selection effect between color and surface brightness : a wide color range is included in the sample for both the faint and bright end .",
    "however , note that there are tight correlations between the hi gas mass ( taken from @xcite ) , the color , the absolute total magnitude and the surface brightness .",
    "figure [ relations ] shows the relationship for these parameters , for the 52 galaxies shown in table [ magnitudes ] .",
    "the 21 nucleated , face - on galaxies ( black dots ) are in fact part of the most massive sample ( in terms of the hi content ) , and with the brightest absolute magnitudes .",
    "the color @xmath46 is computed for the inner 2 kpc for each galaxy .",
    "note the tight relationship for the parameters , especially for the absolute magnitudes in both filters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the brighter a galaxy is , the larger the hi mass , the redder the galaxy , and the higher the surface brightness are .",
    "these trends in optical bands agree with results of @xcite in the near - ir bands @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , note that one can infer from figure [ relations ] that lsbgs ( @xmath47 ) have faint absolute magnitudes ( @xmath48 mag ) .",
    "this is different to what was found in the near - ir bands @xcite .",
    "figure [ profiles ] presents the surface brightness and color profiles for the 21 face - on nucleated galaxies .",
    "contrary to what was expected , a high fraction of them ( 10 galaxies out of 21 ) present a significant inverse color gradient near their center : the color is redder as the distance to the bulge increases .",
    "could this due to dust present in the disk , which redden the color ? if this is not the case , could this be a sign of bulge secular evolution in these spirals , i.e. , the bulge was formed after the disk ?    currently , many authors argue that the dust content of the disk in lsb galaxies is low @xcite , and there is some evidence suggesting that some lsb galaxies are dust poor @xcite .",
    "the combined near - ir and optical photometry shows that these galaxies in fact do not have significant amounts of dust in their most inner parts and their bulge neighborhood ( see however @xcite ) , and is unable to reproduce the observed color gradients ( e.g. galaxies 196 , 213 , 345 , 463 , 468 , 470 , 471 , 473 , 484 and 488 , see also discussion in  5.1 ) .",
    "however , near - ir color gradients ( figure [ near_ir_profiles ] ) show that most of the near - ir surface brightness profiles are ( 1 ) well fitted for all their extension solely by the combination two exponential profiles , and ( 2 ) color gradients are null .",
    "although this last point could support by itself the hypothesis that reddening is not strong in these galaxies or , at least , the dust abundance is similar along the galaxy components ( bulge or disk ) , a large amount of dust seems not to change necessarily the near - ir colors , and therefore the color gradient , as shown in  5.1 .",
    "therefore it is likely that for our selected sample of spirals and lsb galaxies , the nature of these color gradients is not the dust content , either for the galaxies presenting `` normal '' color gradients ( i.e. galaxies with nearly flat or red to blue color gradients ) , as well as for those presenting inverse color gradients .    for galaxies with normal color gradients ,",
    "we support the hypothesis that observed color gradients are generated by a canonical stellar distribution along the radial axis : the stellar populations more distant to the bulge are metal poorer and/or younger compared to the stellar population closer to the bulge .",
    "this scenario agree with the idea that the bulge is formed first from accretion , and the disk form after , and does not agree with stellar formation occurring progressively from the disk to the center of the galaxy mass distribution ( the bulge secular evolution ) . at first impression , the bulge secular evolution does not match with the observation that some early type galaxies were already formed at high-@xmath43 ( @xmath49 ) , following recent results from the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) .",
    "however , there could be an undetermined fraction of bulges in the hudf hosted by undetectable disks with central surface brightnesses well below the limiting surface brightness reached by the acs at the hst galaxies is mainly due to the cosmological dimming factor @xmath50 for the surface brightness @xcite . ]",
    ". these spiral galaxies could be therefore misclassified as pure ellipticals ( compact ones ) . in spite of this evidence ,",
    "we wish to confront the model of bulge secular evolution with our analysis from the structural parameters .",
    "assuming that the internal dust extinction is not the main reason for the inverse color gradients for the 10 galaxies of our sample , the hypothesis of secular evolution for these galaxies should be seriously considered .",
    "we investigate and discuss this hypothesis in the next section , especially in scope of the results for the near - ir light profiles and color gradients .",
    "colors observed in cores of spiral galaxies selected for this study can be compared to those predicted by spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution .",
    "these models predict , among many other quantities , the integrated colors and ages for stellar populations , for a given range of metallicity .",
    "the synthesis models use a wealth of information about stellar evolution , which include stellar evolutionary sequences , spectral libraries , and a number of tunable parameters such as the initial mass function ( imf ) slope , the stellar formation rate ( sfr ) , and current results of semi - empirical theories of chemical enrichment .",
    "they allow the computation of spectral energy distributions for an ensemble of stars ( a galaxy ) , and some selected spectral indices and colors , as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "the model used here is that of @xcite , which provides results as a function of the mean age , after an instantaneous burst of stellar formation and subsequent exponential ( increasing and decreasing ) sfrs , for a metallicity range 0.0052.5 z@xmath29 .",
    "the imf used is that of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite imf gives similar results .",
    "different amplitudes for the star formation are indicated by different exponents in the sfr , which can increase or decrease exponentially from an initial time @xmath51 to present , and @xmath52 for sfrs @xmath53 , and @xmath54 or sfrs @xmath55 .",
    "each one of these exponents is associated with a mean stellar age for the corresponding stellar population . giving the joint evidence of wmap that the last electron scatter was about 13.7 billion years ago , and",
    "stars formed 200 million years after @xcite , it is reasonable to fix model star formation 12 gyrs ago .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath56 is related with the stellar formation efficiency .",
    "for example , the most efficient sfr is set with @xmath57 , where most of the population is formed recently , and has 1 gyr mean age .",
    "alternatively , for the less efficient stellar formation we use @xmath58 , corresponding to an instantaneous burst , i.e. , all stars formed at the same time , with no further stellar formation processes . as discussed in the next section , current evidence suggests that possible paths of bulge formation in hsb galaxies are closely related to the relative size of bulges @xcite .",
    "bulges of hsb spirals , large and prominent , share some properties in their stellar populations with those featured by medium size elliptical galaxies .",
    "more precisely , both populations of stars exhibit the same age and metallicity ( old and metal rich ) .",
    "in contrast , _ small _ bulges present in a number of hsb spirals clearly exhibit different abundances and probably have different ages compared with medium size ellipticals , _ but _ similar properties compared with stellar populations in _ disks _ ( younger and less metal rich than core of ellipticals ) .",
    "are these features also observed in lsb galaxies ?",
    "the color - color diagram @xmath59 vs. @xmath45 for the inner part of the bulges ( radius @xmath60 kpc ) and the corresponding color - color model grid are shown in figure [ br_jk_2 ] .",
    "black dots represent bulge colors of our 21 nucleated , face - on spirals and open circles of @xcite data , corresponding to a @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 photometry for a sample of bulges hosted by spirals .",
    "the major change in @xmath59 is for a z@xmath29 population , which varies only @xmath61 mags for an increase of mean age from 1 gyr to 12 gyrs .",
    "all points have been corrected from atmospheric and galactic extinction , this last using the @xcite extinction maps .",
    "figure [ br_jk_1 ] shows the color - color diagram using colors of the _ inner 2 kpc _ for the 21 selected galaxies , superimposed over the @xcite model grid as in figure [ br_jk_2 ] .",
    "colors have been corrected using the galactic extinction maps of @xcite , and internal extinction supposing a maximum in @xmath46 reddening of 0.3 mag ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "this color - color diagram suggests that stellar populations of small bulges ( open symbols ) , defined by the bulge to disk scale length ratio @xmath62 ( see next section ) compared to average , appear slightly younger and clearly metal poorer than stellar populations hosted by larger bulges ( @xmath63 , filled circles ) , except for three bulges with metallicity above z@xmath29 .",
    "this is expected from the hypothesis of secular evolution : bigger bulges are result of larger accretion time , generating more stellar formation in the past and then the present stellar population is more metal rich compared to what is found in smaller bulges . from figure [ br_jk_1 ] it is also apparent that lsbgs , as usual , but note however that all galaxies are just above or tiny below this limit , and hence we really do not have hsb galaxies strictly speaking . ] tend to have smaller bulges ( open squares ) , which is also consistent with secular evolution : a smaller stellar stellar density ( which define a lsbg ) could impact on a slower secular evolution , forming a smaller bulge as see today . in summary ,",
    "our data suggest that metal poor bulges tend to be smaller than metal rich bulges , on average .",
    "this result _ suggests _ that the relation between the relative size of hsb spiral bulges and their eventual secular evolution , could be also applicable to lsb spirals , given the melting hsb / lsb fraction in our sample . from figure [ br_jk_1 ] , it is clear that @xmath59 is a good metallicity indicator @xcite , and relatively insensitive to stellar populations of different mean ages .",
    "a very hard problem to solve is the amount of internal extinction which reddens each particular galaxy .",
    "the optical color @xmath45 is the most affected by dust and/or gas . in principle , the amount of extinction could be very different from one galaxy to another . however , it is important to keep in mind that in our case : ( 1 ) colors are computed for the central part of the galaxies , in particular for the bulges , where dust is not generally present ; therefore it is reasonable to assume that extinction should not be too large in these regions .",
    "( 2 ) the selected galaxies are oriented face - on , and then the line of sight is not passing through a thick portion of the corresponding galactic disk and/or spiral arms ; thus , the extinction should not be large .",
    "however , when we observe the color - color diagram at face value , specifically the @xmath45 color , one has the impression that @xmath45 is too red compared to the models , appealing for a possible significant extinction .",
    "the key is to estimate the modulus of the extinction vector in the color - color diagram using some reasonable assumptions . for this",
    "we use the spectrophotometric model pegase @xcite , which offer the possibility to consider extinction , by allowing to generate a set of synthetic spectra with different amounts of dust , which are convolved with synthetic filters to estimate the reddening vectors in the @xmath59/@xmath45 plane .",
    "results show that increasing the dust content of the bulge component by as much as 60% from a nominal value , imply an increase in @xmath64 and @xmath45 colors by no more than 0.15 mag over the full range of colors ( see figure [ pegase_reddening ] ) .",
    "each symbol in figure [ pegase_reddening ] represent a different evolutionary stage ( from 0.5 gyr to 13 gyr , from left to right ) with a different metallicity , consistent with stellar evolution , nucleosynthesis and supernova rate .",
    "for each point or square , the dust _ surface density _ is 60% larger than a fiducial dust surface density at the same age .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the internal extinction should not be large , _ at least _ in the regions where our color indices were calculated , i.e. in the bulges .",
    "this is discussed by other authors : for example @xcite , precisely claim that dust does not have a large impact on the color of _ face - on _ nucleated lsb spirals .",
    "an almost negligible extinction in @xmath59 and small extinction in @xmath45 in the bulge ( a maximum of @xmath65 mag ) would primarily affect our age estimates but not our metallicity determinations .",
    "note in figure [ pegase_reddening ] that there is an interval of age where the index @xmath45 has a _ lower _ reddening than @xmath59 , probably due to a saturation effect on the @xmath45 index , which seems to continue for @xmath66 , reflected in the decease of the color @xmath67 ; while the optical thickness increases , the @xmath45 color may saturate and the bulge gets optically thick in both bands . at the same time , however , the galaxy is optically thin in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , although the opacity @xmath56 increases and @xmath59 still reddens .    bulges of hsb galaxies appear to have less scattered colors than those observed in spirals and lsb galaxies of our sample , as shown in the color - color diagram .",
    "their metallicity range is 1.0z@xmath68 z @xmath69z@xmath29 and ages are around 8.6 gyr .",
    "one can compare these results with those obtained for high surface brightness ( hsb ) bulges .",
    "for example , the higher metallicity measured for bulges of hsb spirals of @xcite , represented as open circles in figure [ br_jk_2 ] , is in agreement with the fact that these contain evolved , enriched old stellar populations . however , our data disagree with the metallicity measured for the hsbs in peletier et al .",
    ", in the sense that they claim solar or near solar metallicities using the models of @xcite , and the model we use gives super - solar metallicities .",
    "what probably makes the difference between vazdekis et al .",
    "models and the bruzual & charlot models used here is the contribution of the post - agb stars and other advanced stages of stellar evolution .    in the case of our normal and lsb spirals",
    ", we obtain that bulges show solar or subsolar metallicities , and ages as young as 4 gyrs .",
    "this supports well known results where lsbs appear as metal poor systems @xcite .",
    "we also measure systematic bluer color for lsb bulges , as compared to those bulges of hsb galaxies ( see figure [ br_jk_2 ] ) , both in @xmath45 and @xmath64 .",
    "one of the fundamental questions about galaxy formation , and in scope of the observed stellar population content at a given redshift , is the possible _ chronological _ order in which the different structural components of a spiral galaxy form .",
    "this chronology clearly imposes constraints to the galaxy formation models and to the subsequent stellar evolution of the different building blocks of galaxies . in this context",
    ", one can ask about the order in which the two major components of spirals , namely the bulge and the disk , are formed .",
    "many studies have pointed out that the bulges of grand design spirals ( like m31 ) share many properties with those observed in medium size elliptical galaxies . among these properties",
    "we can mention the so - called @xmath70 @xcite and the fundamental plane @xcite relations .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that bulges of late type spirals ( sc ) follow the same mg-@xmath42 relationship defined for early type ones , suggesting that their bulges share the same mass - metallicity relationship as observed in elliptical galaxies .",
    "these results , along with the kinematical evidence provided by velocity dispersions , support the idea that medium - size elliptical galaxies accrete gas from the surrounding environment , forming a disk and then building up a spiral galaxy @xcite . in this way",
    ", stars in bulges of spiral galaxies should be similar to those in elliptical galaxies , i.e. , old and metal rich , differentiating from those populating disks .",
    "results from kinematical studies and surface brightness observations of hsb galaxies with small bulges , indicate that they share many properties with their corresponding disks .",
    "for example , many bulges of spiral galaxies are much better fitted by exponential profiles than by de vaucouleurs profiles @xcite , and also many of them present a disk like kinematics @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that small bulges of spiral galaxies were built from stars already formed in the corresponding disks , which in turn indicate that stars currently populating such bulges should be similar to those stars populating the corresponding disks ( relatively young and metal rich , but less than those populating elliptical galaxies ) , and therefore are different to stars present in elliptical galaxies . in fact , the excellent work of @xcite based on stellar population models and spectroscopy of the central region of sa - sd spirals , provides evidence in favor of bulge formation in late spirals triggered by gravitational interaction in their disks .",
    "one can argue that the above evidence supports secular evolution .",
    "are these results also valid for some lsb spiral galaxies ?",
    "the hypothesis of secular evolution ( that disk form first , and the bulge emerges naturally from this @xcite ) , imply that the disk and bulge scale lengths are correlated or , in other words , the bulge - to - disk ( b / d ) ratio is independent of galaxy type .",
    "if the sequence of galaxy morphology is continuous in terms of surface brightness , naturally the statement should be valid for both lsbs and hsbs .",
    "this correlation is supported by some models @xcite , and depends mainly on the relative timescales of the star formation and the viscous transport , and on the strength of the total angular momentum .",
    "also , one can predict that secular evolution will produce in many cases what is called pseudobulges : disks agglomerate to the center of the galaxy , producing a high density of stars which structurally are similar to bulges , and share similar stellar population properties observed in the disk .",
    "one of the observed properties is that the entire surface brightness profile can be fitted by a combination of two exponential profiles .",
    "this is exactly what we obtain for most of the optical profiles ( 14 galaxies , figure [ profiles ] ) and almost all the near - ir profiles ( 16 galaxies ) as presented in figure [ near_ir_profiles ] .",
    "thus , one can argue that our data support the evidence not only of secular evolution , but also of the formation of pseudobulges .",
    "figure [ hd_hb ] presents the correlation between disk and bulge scale lengths for a set of spirals .",
    "filled circles correspond to our data and open ones are those compiled by @xcite . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks )",
    "test show that the idea that the two variables are not correlated is rejected at the 98% level .",
    "this could suggest that disk and bulge formation were coupled @xcite .",
    "note that there is _ no correlation _ between the bulge - to - disk scale lengths and the central surface brightness of the disk , as shown by figure [ ratio_scale_lenghts_and_mu ] . in this figure , it is apparent that most scale lengths ratios are around 0.05 and 0.2 , with four outliers with @xmath71 .",
    "these correspond to galaxies 470 , 447 , 324 y 264 .",
    "they do have larger bulges , and well defined surface brightness profiles , except galaxy 264 ( with no acceptable bulge fitting in the near - ir ) , and do not present any other different feature from the rest of the sample , except galaxy 470 , which present inverse color gradient in its bulge .",
    "the correlation between scale lengths of disks and bulges shown in figure [ hd_hb ] suggests that the formation of these two components is coupled , supporting the hypothesis that disks form first and bulges emerge after and , the larger the disk , the larger the corresponding bulge scale length .",
    "the restricted range of @xmath72 for the bulge and disk scale lengths ratio ( figures [ mu_h ] and [ ratio_scale_lenghts_and_mu ] ) is the same as used as an argument for secular evolution models @xcite : self consistent numerical simulations of disk galaxies evolve toward a double exponential profile with a typical bulge - to - disk ratio @xmath73 @xcite , suggesting that bulge formation is triggered by disk instability .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then bulges should be relatively young .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented numerical simulations showing that bars can be formed in massive lsbs under some specific constraint of disk density and gas temperature .",
    "these bars , short in length compared to the halo and quite unstable in time , _ necessarily _ trigger the formation of a bulge component , similar to that present in many lsbs observed in red and near - ir bands by @xcite and @xcite .    for our sample of 21 galaxies ( figure [ hd_hb ] ,",
    "filled circles ) , we define the relative size of their bulges using the ratio between their scale lengths ( @xmath74 ) , which is naturally correlated with the hubble type .",
    "a small bulge has a ratio @xmath74 below 1@xmath42 compared to average ( a hubble type typically a sc ) .",
    "a large bulge has a @xmath74 above 1@xmath42 respect to the average ( a hubble type sa or sb ) . although we do not observe a tight relationship between these two scale lengths ( particularly if we consider the 3 outliers marked in the figure ) , the trend is clear and similar to what has been observed by @xcite ( open circles ) , suggesting a possible secular evolution .",
    "both , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , follow approximately the same trend , except that our slope ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) is somewhat different to that of @xcite , indicated as a dashed line in figure [ hd_hb ] ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "we therefore define a bulge as `` small '' if @xmath81 and `` large '' if @xmath82 , considering our average slope @xmath83 and its measured standard deviation .",
    "note that we are not excluding any galaxy from our sample following this criterion and , although the number of galaxies is small , trends are observed clearly for the scale length ratios . in figure [ hb_hd_near_ir ] we show a similar correlation as in figure [ hd_hb ] , but for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 near - ir bands .",
    "the correlation holds and in fact , the scatter is even smaller .",
    "however , near - ir bulge scale lengths are larger compared to their optical counterparts .",
    "this is natural if we think that the bulge is metal rich compared to the disk and with older stellar populations .",
    "therefore the bulge appear brighter and larger in the near - ir .    in summary ,",
    "( 1 ) the observed relationship between @xmath75 , @xmath76 and its ratios , ( 2 ) the inverse color gradients in the optical , ( 3 ) the double exponential fit for most of the galaxies , both in the optical and the near - ir bands , and ( 4 ) the almost null @xmath59 color gradients , support the secular evolution hypothesis .",
    "however , the fact that most bulges are redder than disks ( see figure [ profiles ] ) , favors at first impression the scenario where bulges were formed before disks .",
    "@xcite showed that , in this case , it should also exist a correlation between the bulge and disk scale lengths , similar to the correlation observed in figure [ hd_hb ] .",
    "if this last scenario is correct , bulges should be relatively old compared to disks . nevertheless , note that even two stellar populations formed at the same time , but with different surface density ( e.g. the bulge and the disk , the first a denser one ) could evolve differently . a larger surface density would favor a more efficient stellar formation , and therefore a larger sfr at the bulge , resulting in a redder bulge compared to the disk .",
    "it is worth noting that the observed trend does not strongly support the hypothesis that hsb galaxies are progenitors of lsb galaxies , since we do not observe that hsb galaxies are bluer than lsb galaxies . in fact , bulges of lsb galaxies appear metal poor compared to bulges of hsb galaxies ( see figure [ br_jk_2 ] ) .",
    "one of the most striking features in the optical color profiles , is the inverse color gradient in the central zone in 11 of the 21 galaxies , i.e. the color is bluer as radius decreases .",
    "@xcite , comparing data of lsb galaxies with chemical and spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution , arrive to the conclusion that , given the large scatter observed in the lsb galaxy properties , it is necessary to introduce both starburst events as well as interruption of ongoing stellar formation processes , in order to match models with observations .",
    "these events could arise by gravitational interactions , causing then inverse color gradients .",
    "@xcite , studying a hst dataset of 77 early - type galaxies presenting this inverse color gradient , use a multizone single - collapse model which account for the observed blue cores .",
    "the model adopts a broad spread in formation redshifts for elliptical galaxies , allowing some of these galaxies to begin their formation up to 1 gyr before the redshift of observation .",
    "therefore , the single - zone collapse model produces cores that are bluer than the outer regions because of the increase of the local potential well toward the center , which makes star formation more extended in the central region of the galaxy than in the outer parts .",
    "could these inverse color gradients be an evidence of secular evolution ?",
    "the answer to this question is directly related to the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "indeed , bulges can be redder because they are older , more metallic or more affected by dust reddening .",
    "the inverse color gradients presented here would support secular evolution , if it would be possible to show that these gradients are exclusively due to metallicity @xcite . however , further evidence already discussed here , namely ( 1 ) the relationship between @xmath75 , @xmath76 and its ratios , ( 2 ) the double exponential fit for most of the face - on nucleated galaxies , both in the optical and the near - ir bands ( pseudobulges ? ) , and ( 4 ) the almost null radial @xmath59 color gradients , support the secular evolution hypothesis .",
    "the null @xmath59 gradient suggests that the bulge and disk stellar population are much more similar , i.e. , that their metallicity is uniform ( see figure [ br_jk_1 ] or [ br_jk_2 ] ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of a sample of 21 face - on nucleated hsb and lsb spirals selected from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "we have studied their bulges colors and structural parameters in scope of bulge and disk formation , obtaining the following relevant results .",
    "first , bulge and disk scale lengths appear to be marginally correlated , weakly supporting a secular evolutionary process between these two components",
    ". however , the relationship between the bulge and disk sizes for hsb seems ( b / d @xmath73 ) to be identical to that observed for lsb galaxies , which can be understood in a general context of bulge and disk formation .",
    "also , our results agree with the analysis both from observations presented by @xcite , and from models by @xcite , suggesting that bulges could be formed by bar instabilities in early stages of disk evolution .",
    "the recently discovered red lsbs , with a notable non - axisymmetric structure and bulge components , are in agreement with many of the lsb models which incorporate massive disks .",
    "second , structural analysis shows that lsb galaxies follow the same trends ( bulge size , disk size , scale lengths , etc . )",
    "observed in hsb galaxies , which constitutes evidence that , at least in their structure , lsb galaxies are not a different type of galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , we rule out the possibility that hsb galaxies are progenitors of lsbs , basically using the fact that the colors of their bulges are redder compared to those observed in lsbs .",
    "third , almost half of our sample shows inverse gradients in their @xmath45 radial color profiles ( bluer color toward center ) .",
    "although there is not a straightforward explanation for this , this analyze is key to understand correctly the possible chronology of events which lead to the formation of disk and bulge .",
    "our near - ir surface brightness profiles , do not show inverse color gradients , but present null color gradients which , with the evidence that almost all the light profiles are well fitted by exponential forms ( in the optical and in the near - ir ) , support the secular evolution for these face - on nucleated galaxies and the existence of pseudobulges .",
    "fourth , using a spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution , and using the fact that the color index @xmath59 is metal sensitive , we find evidence suggesting that bulges of lsbs are metal poor compared to those hosted by hsbs , extending the overall result from emission line analysis that stellar formation regions of lsbs are also metal poor compared to hsb ones @xcite .",
    "using the synthesis model pegase , we have shown that a possible small amount of dust in the bulges does not play an important role on the bulges color and structural parameter properties , and that the extinction in @xmath45 is smaller than 0.3 mags .",
    "we arrive to the same conclusions of @xcite .",
    "moreover , we obtain that bulges hosted by lsb galaxies tend to be small ones . in turn , small bulges are metal poor , compared to larger bulges .",
    "this agree with the secular evolution model , in which bulges are built up secularly from the disk , where small bulges have been subject of weak stellar formation processes and slower accretion , leading to a metal poor stellar population in average .",

    "<S> it is an observational fact that bulges of spiral galaxies contain a high fraction of old and metal - rich stars . following this observational fact , </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated colors of 21 bulges hosted by a selected sample of high surface brightness spirals and low surface brightness galaxies observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 optical bands and in @xmath2 and @xmath3 near - ir bands . using structural parameters derived from these observations we obtain evidence that bulges could be formed by pure disk evolution ( secular evolution ) , in agreement with the suggestion by some authors . </S>",
    "<S> the color profiles , especially the near - ir ones show null or almost null color gradients , supporting the hypothesis that the disk stellar populations are similar to those present in the bulge , and/or some bulges can be understood as disks with enhanced stellar density ( or pseudobulges ) . in the optical , half of the galaxies present an inverse color gradient , giving additional evidence in favor of secular evolution for the sample investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the observed colors with those obtained from spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution suggests that bulges of the selected sample have solar and subsolar metallicity , and are independent of the current stellar formation rate . also , we obtain evidence suggesting that galaxies hosting small bulges tend to be systematically metal poor compared to those with larger bulges . </S>",
    "<S> these results are being checked more carefully with high s / n spectroscopy .    </S>",
