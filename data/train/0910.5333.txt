    "[ tab_parameters ] ) . in this case , the deviation is probably due to the different scopes of refs . and , namely the crystal structure and the electronic properties , respectively .",

    "obviously , the magnitude of the interface - induced spin splitting is much larger than the conventional spin splitting for @xmath146k , k. however , at k , k the interface - induced spin splitting vanishes because the edge states become delocalized over the whole graphene region so that the interface contribution to the spin splitting vanishes .",
    "this means that the spin splitting due to the bulk graphene soi is dominant at k , k.        this is important for the qsvhe in that the fermi energy must be tuned exactly to the spin - orbit gap which is due to the bulk graphene soi .",

    "<S> the projected hamiltonian reads @xmath79 with @xmath80 the @xmath1-edge state annihilation operators and @xmath81_{\\tau\\tau ' } \\label{eff_so_ham},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 are constants describing the rashba and intrinsic parts of the effective soi . </S>",
    "<S> the dresselhaus term ( @xmath83 ) vanishes because of the mirror symmetry @xmath84 of the interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the additional factor @xmath85 accounts for the fact that the effective soi , generated by a gg interface , must be proportional to the amplitude of the state at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath86mev and @xmath87mev are obtained from a fit to the numerical results ( see appendix f ) . because of time - reversal invariance the spin splitting is exactly zero at @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> these are also the points where the spin direction of the energetically higher edge state changes abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> note that for wide ribbons ( @xmath89 nm ) , the spin splitting at k , k is essentially given by the bulk soi because @xmath90 vanishes for @xmath91k , k. as a result , the soi enhancement at the interfaces does not increase the critical temperature at which the qsvhe can be observed </S>",

    "<S> however , there is another possibility to use the interfacial enhancement of the soi for high temperature spin - valley conversion . </S>",
    "<S> the spin splitting at k and k decays like @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one should use narrow ribbons in order to exploit the soi enhancement at gg interfaces . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_bandstructure ] , the band structure of a narrow gg heterostructure is shown . at the maxima of the edge mode </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit splitting is about 78 @xmath93ev @xmath94k . </S>",
    "<S> note that although these states are derived from edge states , they do not actually appear like edge states in this case because @xmath95 ( @xmath96 diverges near k and k ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by squeezing the wide edge states into a narrow ribbon , the spin - orbit splitting is enhanced at k and k.    as required , the energetically higher band at k has the opposite spin - direction than the corresponding band at k. thus , by tuning @xmath54 as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_bandstructure ] , a spin - valley filter is realized : left- and right - movers exist for each spin and valley but the transmission of this structure is only non - zero for ( k,@xmath63 ) or for ( k,@xmath64 ) and zero for the other two combinations of valley and spin . </S>",
    "<S> this means that each spin - up electron which initially consists of k and k components ( valley - unpolarized ) will be in a pure valley state ( k here ) after it has passed the narrow @xmath57-ribbon in x - direction , while a valley - unpolarized spin - down electron will be in a pure k state after the passage . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that graphane can be utilized to create an effective edge for the @xmath0-band in graphene and that the soi of the resulting edge states is strongly enhanced , compared to pure graphene . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown that , due to enhanced soi at graphene / graphane interfaces , binary information which is encoded in the spin of an electron can be transferred to a valley - based encoding .    </S>",
