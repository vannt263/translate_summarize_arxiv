    "at present , nonradial stellar pulsations constitute a valuable tool in extracting information about the properties and internal structure of objects that undergo such kind of oscillations .",
    "as observational techniques are refined , a growing variety of stellar objects is discovered that undergo nonradial oscillations .",
    "the most extensively studied case is our sun , which has been shown to vibrate in a large amount of modes , investigation of which has been so powerful in revealing clues of its internal structure that it is known as the discipline of _ helioseismology_. also , it has been established that different kinds of stellar objects which are located in a variety of places in the hr diagram , covering several evolutionary stages , undergo nonradial pulsations , e.g. : ap , wr , @xmath1 scuti , @xmath2 cephei , and variable white dwarfs ( hereafter wds ) : dav , dbv , dov and pnnv . the study of oscillations in such variable stars , and the subsequent comparison and fitting with theoretical pulsation patterns is now known as _",
    "asteroseismology_. for a general introduction to this topic see , e.g. , cox ( 1980 ) ; unno , et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ; brown & gilliland ( 1994 ) ; and gaustchy & saio ( 1995 ; 1996 ) .    from the observational point of view",
    "( with the obvious exception of our sun ) , wds represent the best established kind of nonradial pulsators .",
    "wds are the final fate for low and intermediate mass stars . during its cooling",
    ", they go across very narrow instability strips inside which suffer nonradial pulsations in the branch of g- ( gravity ) modes with periods between 100 and 2000 sec and amplitudes up to 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "as wds cools down , the outermost layers main constituent ( hydrogen in davs , helium in dbvs , and probably carbon or oxygen in dovs and pnnvs ; see e.g. brown & gilliland 1994 and gaustchy & saio 1995 ; 1996 ) gets partial ionization conditions which forces the development of an outer convection zone ( ocz ) . in the bottom of such zone the instabilities are originated ( @xmath3 mechanism of overstability ) .",
    "this gives rise to the blue edge of the instability strip ( see , e.g. , dziembowski & koester 1981 and winget , et al .",
    "1982 ; see also tassoul , fontaine & winget 1990 , hereafter tfw ) .",
    "the physical reason for the appearance of a red edge is still under debate .    at present",
    ", there is a general consensus that variable wds are very interesting objects for asteroseismological studies .",
    "their very simple internal structure allows us to predict theoretically the modes with a very high degree of detail and sophistication .",
    "also , they have a very rich spectrum of periods which may give us information about stellar masses ( by means of measuring the mean period spacing ) , core composition ( by measuring the rate of change of the period @xmath4 ) , mass of the surface helium and hydrogen layers ( if present ) ( by means of the departures from uniform period spacing and mode trapping ) , velocity of rotation and strength of the magnetic field ( studying the fine structure of a multiplet ) , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , bradley 1996 ) .",
    "so , it is not surprising that in the last years davs and dbvs as well as dovs have been the preferred target for the network called `` whole earth telescope '' ( wet ) .",
    "wet observations have been of an unprecedent quality which in some cases ( see , e.g. , winget et al . 1991 ; kawaler 1993 ; bradley & winget 1994 ) allowed to apply the powerful tools above mentioned .    in view of the growing importance of this line of research , in our observatory",
    "we have begun the study of nonradial oscillations . to this end , we have developed a code to compute eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies for spherical objects in the linear , adiabatic approximation .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to describe the numerical techniques employed in our program to search for and to compute the modes and its application to the case of a 0.3 @xmath0 pure helium wd .",
    "this code is based on a modification of the general newton - raphson technique presented in kippenhahn , weigert & hofmeister ( 1967 ) to solve the set of difference equations which represent the differential equations of linear , adiabatic , nonradial pulsations of spherical stars .    in order to test the code",
    "we have applied it to the case of polytropic spheres whose eigenfrequencies have been computed with very high accuracy ( christensen - dalsgaard & mullan 1994 ) .",
    "also , we have coupled our pulsation code to an stellar evolution code .",
    "we have done it in order to be able to follow the changes in the pulsational spectrum of a given model during its evolution with a number of steps as large as it would be needed by specific studies . in making such computation",
    "we selected an evolutionary time step short enough such that eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to a given model are used as a initial approximation to those of the next one .",
    "this is very useful for a relaxation code like this and is intended to work as it is the case of the heneyey technique in stellar evolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ secc : deq ] is devoted to present the differential equations of linear , adiabatic , nonradial pulsations we have to solve . in section [ secc : code ] a detailed description of the general newton - raphson technique we employ for computing the eigenmodes is presented . section [ secc : polyt ] , presents the results for the case of polytropic spheres , and in section [ secc : helium ] we describe the work we have done with a realistic helium wd model .",
    "finally , in section [ secc : conclu ] summarize our results .",
    "the differential equations that govern linear , nonradial pulsations of spherical stars in the adiabatic approximation are ( unno , et al . 1989 ) :    @xmath5}\\    y_{2 }   + { v_{g}\\ y_{3}},\\ ] ]    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8}\\ y_{3 } - u\\ y_{4}.\\ ] ]    @xmath9 is the independent variable defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radial coordinate and @xmath12 is the stellar radius .",

    "@xmath23 is the local acceleration of gravity and @xmath24 is the stellar mass .",
    "@xmath25 is the dimensionless square of the angular frequency of oscillation , @xmath26 .    among the coefficients of eqs .",
    "( [ 46]-[49 ] ) there appears the harmonic degree @xmath27 , corresponding to the spherical harmonic @xmath28 which describes the angular dependence of the oscillation pattern .",
    "the adimensional quantities @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , inherent to the non - perturbed model , are defined as :    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the first adiabatic index , @xmath38 is the square of the local velocity of sound , @xmath39 is the mass contained in a ( non - perturbed ) sphere of radius @xmath11 , and @xmath40 is the brunt - visl frequency .",
    "( [ 46]-[49 ] ) together with the adequate boundary conditions conform the eigenvalue problem to be solved .",
    "in order to write the pulsation equations in a form adequate for numerical calculations we divide our non - perturbed model in a number of spherical , concentric shells . this is equivalent to divide the dominion of the independent variable in @xmath41 mesh points ( @xmath42 shells ) non - necessarily equidistantly spaced @xmath43 . in our treatment we define @xmath44 as the surface and @xmath45 as the central point of the model .",

    "( [ 46]-[49 ] ) has been solved .    in order to search for the first approximation to the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalue of a mode , we have applied the method of the discriminant presented in unno et al .",
    "specifically , the expression adopted reads @xmath91_{1 }    + [ y_{4}]_{1}$ ] .",
    "notice that @xmath92 corresponds exactly to the second outer boundary condition given in eqs .",
    "( [ bc_outer ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to that book for more details .",
    "obviously , for applying this technique we need to define a grid of meshpoints . in getting an appropriate distribution of meshpoints",
    "we have employed a simple recipe . as a first approximation to the solution of the oscillation equations",
    "we have computed the eigenfunctions and eigenvalue taking the points at which the equilibrium model is defined .",
    "after convergence , we have redistributed the grid asking for the same criterium usually employed in stellar evolution ( kippenhahn , et al .",
    "1967 ) : that the relative variation of each eigenfunction inside a zone must be below some prescribed limit ( if the eigenfunctions are below some other very small , prescribed value we have asked for absolute differences in place of relative ones ) . if necessary , our program add or remove meshpoints , using spline interpolation over quantities of non - perturbed model , and lineal interpolation in eigenfunctions , since these will be improved after in the general newton - raphson stage .",
    "as a first test for our code , we have applied it to the well - known case of nonradial pulsations of polytropic spheres .",
    "polytropes are particularly adequate for the purpose of testing , because in this case we separate the inaccuracies of the non - perturbed model from those inherent to the nonradial pulsation code . in particular we have computed the p- ( pressure ) , f- ( fundamental ) and g- ( gravity ) modes of polytropes with indices @xmath93 and @xmath94 for the case of @xmath95 and @xmath94 .    because in this case @xmath29 and @xmath32 are divergent at surface ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : vg ] and [ eq : astar ] ) , we have integrated the structure by means of an accurate runge - kutta technique ( press , et al . 1992 ) and most of the meshpoints were located near surface .",
    "here we assumed @xmath96 .    to compare our eigenvalues with those available in the literature we shall employ the work of christensen - dalsgaard & mullan ( 1994 ) which presents accurate eigenfrequency tabulations for a variety of polytropic spheres . for such purpose we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chd ] the relative difference @xmath97 for the cases of p - modes for @xmath98 and @xmath95 , g - modes for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and also for p - modes for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the comparison indicates that the higher radial order the larger the relative differences are , without any dependency on @xmath27 value .",
    "the absolute value of relative differences found in the eigenvalues are @xmath103 , except in the @xmath104 g - modes , for which the difference is @xmath105 . as christensen - dalsgaard & mullan ( 1994 ) state that their computations are accurate to @xmath106 we conclude that our code is able to compute the eigenvalues of polytropes with a precision of @xmath107 which is enough for our purposes .",
    "with the aim of investigating the behaviour of the code when it is applied to realistic models , in this section we shall consider nonradial g - modes in evolutionary models of low mass , pure helium wds .",
    "this election is due mainly because of two reasons .",
    "first , at present we have available a detailed and updated code we have employed in the calculation of the evolution of such stars ( see , e.g. , althaus & benvenuto 1997 ; benvenuto & althaus 1998 ) . such evolutionary code is fully described in the above - cited papers .",
    "second , the computation of nonradial modes in pure helium wds provide us an important way for testing the pulsation code when applied to realistic models . at present , to our notice there is no study available in the literature on the pulsation properties of these objects . in evaluating our results",
    "we shall pay special attention to the asymptotic behaviour of periods of oscillation , comparing in particular the spacing of adjacent periods ( for the same @xmath27 ) with that predicted by asymptotic theory of tassoul ( 1980 ) in stars with homogeneous composition .",
    "this theory has been employed as check for the nonradial spectrum of polytropes ( mullan & ulrich 1988 ; mullan 1989 ) in the cowling approximation .",
    "one possible way for computing nonradial oscillations modes in evolutionary models is to first compute such structures with a evolutionary code , and then to choose a subset of these models ( usually belonging to a predetermined interval in @xmath108 , called hereafter @xmath108-strip ) for pulsation analysis .",
    "this procedure has been employed in most of the studies of adiabatic pulsations in wds to date ( see , e.g. , tfw , bradley , winget & wood 1993 , bradley 1996 , brassard et al .",
    "1992a , 1992b ) .    here , we present an alternative way for computing nonradial modes in evolutionary sequences .",
    "the basic idea is very direct : if the time step in the evolutionary sequence is short enough , eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to a given model should strongly resemble those corresponding to the previous one .",
    "then , if we couple the pulsation code to the evolutionary code , it is feasible to avoid the scan in @xmath25 for each model : the search of modes is carried out only for the first model inside the relevant @xmath108-strip .",
    "the modes are computed and stored and serve as a trial solution for the next model and so on . in this way it is possible",
    "economize cpu time , and ( more importantly ) it is possible to follow the changes in the pulsational spectrum due to the evolution of the stellar structure in a continuous fashion .",
    "let us briefly describe how our pulsation and evolutionary codes work together .",
    "firstly , @xmath108-strip is chosen , as well as the frequency window to be scanned .",
    "the evolutionary code computes the model up to the moment when the model reaches the hot edge of the @xmath108-strip .",
    "then , the program calls the pulsation routine beginning the scan for eigenfrequencies , as described in  [ secc : code ] .",
    "when a mode is found , the code generates an approximate solution for @xmath109 and @xmath25 , which is improved iteratively .",
    "then , such solution is tested and , if necessary , meshpoints are redistributed as outlined in  [ secc : code ] , and iterated to convergence . before improving the solution , the eigenmodes have been stored on the original grid in a common block , with the aim of being employed later as an approximate solution for the next stellar model of the sequence . when the computation of the mode has been finished , the code begins to look for eigenmodes again , and the process is repeated until the given frequency window is fully covered .",
    "thus , we have finished the computation of all eigenmodes of the first model belonging to the @xmath108-strip and the structure of each one is now in the computer memory .",
    "then , the evolutionary code generates the next stellar model and the code calls pulsation routine again , but in this occasion the search for modes is skipped . instead of this , stored eigenmodes are taken as input to the general newton - raphson scheme to approximate the modes of this subsequent stellar model .",
    "then , the solution is iterated , and so on .",
    "the whole procedure is automatically repeated for all evolutionary models inside the @xmath108-strip .",
    "when the star gets outside the @xmath108-strip , computation is finished .    in terms of cpu",
    ", a large fraction of the running time is spent in the search for modes , but this is executed only once .",
    "the process of relaxation and improvement of the solution is faster , and the building of each stellar model is almost instantaneous .",
    "as mentioned before , we have choose models of helium wds for checking the efficiency our pulsation code in realistic stellar configurations . to be specific",
    ", we computed nonradial g - modes for a helium wd model with mass @xmath110 , in the range of @xmath111 .",
    "the complete sequence comprise 216 models .",
    "convection , present in the outermost layers , is treated with the ml3 version of mixing length theory .      since one of our interests here",
    "is to evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of eigenperiods , we have computed nonradial g - modes for @xmath112 and @xmath113 with radial order from @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "the resulting set of modes is adequate for our purpose , since it covers a broad range in periods , enough for enabling the comparison with the predictions of the asymptotic theory of tassoul ( 1980 ) .",
    "here we employ the mechanical external boundary condition given in unno , et al .",
    "( 1989 )    @xmath116 - y_{2 } + y_{3 } \\bigg [ 1 + \\bigg ( \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{\\omega^2 } - \\ell- 1 \\bigg ) \\frac{1}{v } \\bigg ] = 0 , \\label{eq : buenabc}\\ ] ]    which replaces the first of eqs .",
    "( [ bc_outer ] ) .    for each computed mode , the quantities of interest are the period @xmath117 , eigenfunctions @xmath118 ; kinetic energy k.e . , and first order rotation splitting coefficient , @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , we compute the variational period , @xmath120 , and the weight function , wf , in the form given by kawaler , hansen & winget ( 1985 ) . also , for each non - perturbed model we obtain the asymptotic spacing of periods ( for the same @xmath27 ) , @xmath121 , given by ( tfw , tassoul 1980 )    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is defined as    @xmath124^{-1}.\\ ] ]    as in tfw , for computing @xmath123 we have ignored the presence of an ocz , integrating from the center to the surface of model but setting @xmath125 in the ocz where @xmath126 . in this approximation , we have overestimated the value of @xmath127 , but since the thickness of the ocz ( in the radial coordinate ) is very small , this is a good approximation .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath128 are qualitatively very similar .",
    "although pulsations have not yet been observed in these stars , in other pulsating wds the modes with @xmath129 dominate the observations , thus we shall concentrate in @xmath130 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_y1 ] we have plotted the eigenfunction @xmath85 for the modes g@xmath131 , @xmath132 , g@xmath133 with @xmath134 , for a model with @xmath135 k. from fig . [ fig : he_y1 ] it is evident that @xmath85 has large amplitudes in the whole star , especially in the core .",
    "this feature is strongly emphasized when we inspect modes with increasing @xmath136 .",
    "this is a remarkable difference in the behaviour of @xmath85 comparing with the case of oscillating da and db wds . in such wds",
    "@xmath85 has a lower central amplitude ( for modes with @xmath137 in a @xmath138 da wd model see , e.g. , fig .",
    "14a and 16a of brassard et al .",
    "1992b ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : he_wf ] displays the normalized weight function ( wf ) for g@xmath131,@xmath132,g@xmath133 ( @xmath130 ) of the same model .",
    "wf provides a measure of the relative contribution from different zones in the model to the period formation .",
    "the plot indicates that period formation happens mainly in external region of star , where wf is large .",
    "however there are important contributions from central locations ( @xmath139 ) , which is somewhat different to the wf corresponding to the case of da and db wds , for which wf displays appreciate values only in the envelope ( in the `` normal '' modes ; see figs .",
    "15 and 17 of brassard et al .",
    "1992b ) .",
    "let us discuss our results concerning periods ( @xmath117 ) and kinetic energies ( k.e . ) .",
    "the periods here computed show the expected trend in g - modes , with values increasing with the order of modes @xmath136 . since our calculations covers a wide @xmath108-strip ,",
    "it is possible infer the changes of periods during wd cooling .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we have computed the brunt - visl frequency as in tfw ( the ledoux term @xmath140 is zero for the whole of model , since it is chemically homogeneous ) .",
    "we have found that @xmath40 decreases as the model cools down , a feature that is very pronounced in the core .",
    "it is due mainly to the increasing degeneracy in that region , decoupling more and more pressure from temperature ( @xmath141 drops ) .",
    "as consequence eigenperiods increase monotonically when @xmath108 drops below @xmath142 k , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_per]a .    next",
    ", we consider the behaviour of the kinetic energy ( k.e . ) of the modes . we have found that , as expected in a chemically homogeneous star , k.e",
    ". is a smooth function of @xmath136 and thus of the period . in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_ener ] we show @xmath143(k.e . )",
    "vs. @xmath108 for the models included in fig .",
    "[ fig : he_per ] . for hotter models",
    "it is clear that the more energetic modes are those with lower order , because they penetrate deep in the star , where density is high .",
    "however , when @xmath108 drops below @xmath142 k the energy of high order modes ( which are mainly concentrated in the outer envelope of star ) strongly increase .",
    "the explanation of this effect ( see brassard et al .",
    "1992b in context of a da wd star ) resides in the fact that at such @xmath108 value the ocz of the object suddenly gets thicker ( see the dotted line in fig .",
    "17 of althaus & benvenuto 1997 ) .",
    "the high order modes that oscillates in the envelope feel gradually the presence of convection as the star cools down .",
    "since that in oczs g - modes become evanescent , such modes are forced to get larger amplitudes somewhat below the bottom of the ocz where the density is larger . since k.e .",
    "is proportional to the integral of square of displacement , weighted by @xmath144 , these modes oscillate with larger energies . in sharp contrast to the behaviour of high @xmath136 modes , low order modes are rather insensitive to the thickening of the ocz .    now let us discuss the period spacing of the modes . to our knowledge there is no study available in the literature devoted to nonradial pulsations of helium wds .",
    "this situation does not allow us to perform a direct comparison of our results .",
    "nevertheless we can have a good idea related to the reliability of our pulsation code examining the period spacing of consecutive modes of the same @xmath27 .",
    "tassoul ( 1980 ) predicted that the asymptotic period spacing for g - modes for a chemically homogeneous object in the adiabatic approximations is a constant value @xmath127 ( see eq . [ eq : asympt ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltap ] we show the forward period spacing @xmath145 vs. radial order @xmath136 ( @xmath129 ) for models with @xmath146 and @xmath147 k. as reference we also include in this figure the corresponding asymptotic spacing predicted by tassoul ( 1980 ) treatment . from fig .",
    "[ fig : deltap ] it is clear that the trend of the numerical solution is the correct one .    in order to get an estimation of the accuracy of our treatment , we have calculated the variational eigenperiods ( @xmath148 ) for each mode in the formalism presented by kawaler , et al .",
    "the comparison of variational and numerical eigenperiods for the values of @xmath27 here considered gives a difference between these treatments which is lower than @xmath149 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : variational ] for the case of @xmath129 ) .    by the way ,",
    "let us comment on that we have also tested our code running it on the same models for which oscillation modes were previously computed .",
    "specifically we have employed for such test two carbon - oxygen da wd models of 0.5 @xmath0 and 0.85 @xmath0 whose structure was computed with the wdec evolutionary code and its vibrational properties were previously analyzed ( bradley 1996 ) . in this case @xmath150 ; @xmath151 and @xmath152k .",
    "this is a valuable test for our pulsation code because we could confront our results with those of other researchers working on detailed models .",
    "also the fact that these models were computed with the same evolutionary code is valuable because differences in the resulting periods are due only to the pulsation code and not to differences in e.g. between the treatment of the equation of state in our evolutionary code and in wdec . considering a large amount of modes",
    ", the differences between the previously computed periods and those we have found has been below @xmath153 .",
    "thus , we judge that our code produce results accurate enough for our purposes .",
    "this comparison has been made possible by paul bradley who provided us with the da wd models and the periods of many its modes .",
    "in this paper we have presented a general code intended for calculating linear , adiabatic , nonradial eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies corresponding to spherically symmetric stars by means of a finite difference scheme .",
    "this is a very simple strategy based on a slight modification of the general newton - raphson method for computing stellar evolution presented by kippenhahn , weigert & hofmeister ( 1967 ) because of the different structure of the matrix to be inverted in finding the iterative corrections .    as a first test to this code",
    "we have applied it to the simplest case : polytropic spheres . as there exist very precise tabulations of the eigenfrequencies for such configurations , we have been able to perform a quantitative comparison of our results with the best available in the literature ( christensen - dalsgaard & mullan 1994 ) .",
    "we have found that our code is able to compute polytropic eigenfrequencies with an accuracy of @xmath154 or much better for low @xmath136 values .",
    "then , we have coupled this nonradial oscillation code to our evolutionary code and applied it to the computation of the pulsation spectrum of pure , low mass helium white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "specifically we considered the case of an object with a mass of 0.3 @xmath0 for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath108-strip ) . in making such computation",
    "we have employed a new method . taking a short - enough time step in the evolutionary sequence , eigenvalues and eigenfunctions corresponding to a given model",
    "strongly resemble those corresponding to the previous one .",
    "then , we scan for modes in the first model inside the @xmath108-strip .",
    "eigenmodes are computed and stored and serve as a trial solution for the next model and so on . in this way it is possible to follow the changes in the the pulsational spectrum due to the evolution of the stellar structure in a continuous and fairly detailed fashion (",
    "[ fig : he_per ] ) .    regarding the computation of g - modes for the 0.3 @xmath0 pure helium wd model we have presented eigenfunctions and weight function ( wf ) for low order @xmath136 modes , and periods , period spacing , kinetic energy ( k.e . ) and variational periods for a wide range of modes .",
    "these quantities were computed for the case of @xmath134 and @xmath113 but in figs .",
    "[ fig : he_wf ] - [ fig : variational ] we have presented only the case @xmath129 for brevity . to our notice this is the first effort in studying the pulsation properties of helium wds .",
    "our experience with realistic helium wd models indicates that our numerical code for pulsations work nicely and in particular the solutions we have found have an asymptotic period spacing in good agreement with the predictions of the analytical theory of tassoul ( 1980 ) .",
    "this , and the fact that comparison with more complex wd models with layers of different internal composition show us that our numerical tool for computing eigenmodes work adequately , especially regarding the coupling we have performed between it and our evolutionary code .",
    "we plan in the near future to apply this new code to the study of pulsation of wds in general .",
    "the authors would like to warmly acknowledge paul bradley for his kindness in providing us with numerical models of carbon - oxygen da wds together with his pulsation calculations and also for the time he spent in doing so .",
