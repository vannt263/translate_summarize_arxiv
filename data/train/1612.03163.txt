    "we use the intrinsic x - ray luminosity , instead of the @xmath43(5100   ) luminosity commonly used to estimate the size of the blr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , using the bayesian  estimation  of  hardness  ratios code @xcite , we find that the 90% statistical upper limit on the hardness ratio , defined as ( h - s)/(h+s ) , is -0.9 , requiring a power law index greater than @xmath82 , suggesting significant contamination by soft x - ray photons of a non - agn origin .",

    "component as the dashed black line.,title=\"fig : \" ]    using a model of three gaussian components derived from the doublet , we achieved a good fit to the h@xmath40 + complex after adding the additional broad line component ( figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "the fwhm of this broad line component is @xmath83  km  s@xmath11 , where the uncertainty is 1@xmath21 and derived from the fit covariance matrix . as a check on this uncertainty , we created a ` null ' spectrum without any additional broad h@xmath40 component , and using the best - fit parameters for the rest of the line components of h@xmath40 , , and .",
    "we then made @xmath84 permutations of this spectrum , adding to each a broad line with a fwhm randomly chosen between 4000 and 7000 km  s@xmath11 , and with a flux randomly chosen between 1/3 and 3 times the flux of the line measured in the original spectrum .",
    "we then added gaussian noise to the spectrum with sigma taken from the spectral uncertainty described in ",
    "[ subsec : methodbhmass ] . after fitting each spectrum with our model , we find that the scatter between the input fwhm and the fit fwhm has a standard deviation of @xmath85  km  s@xmath11 , which we take as a more realistic estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "we repeated this procedure on the sdss spectrum of , but we did not find evidence for an additional broad line component .    additionally , we explored any possible effect of the use of gaussian components to parameterize the doublet by repeating our line fitting procedure using lorentzian components .",
    "we tested a model with and without a broad line component , and compared their values .",
    "the addition of a gaussian broad line to the lorentzian model reduces by a factor of @xmath86 , with fwhm  =  6540  km  s@xmath11 , consistent with the gaussian - based model within the uncertainties . however , the model using gaussian components yields a much better overall fit to the data , with a that is 42% that of the lorentzian model , and a ks test shows that the residuals of the gaussian model are consistent with the spectral uncertainties ( @xmath87 ) , while the residuals of the lorentzian model are not ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we therefore use the fwhm of the broad line from the gaussian - based model , not only because of the better fit but also because it yields a more conservative estimate of the fwhm of the broad line .",
    "we note that the boss spectrum aperture overlaps somewhat with a knot of h@xmath40-heavy emission seen in figure  [ fig : rgiig ] , top and bottom left panels .",
    "while the method of modeling the non - blr emission we employ is designed to avoid uncertainties with respect to the source of broad emission , it is nonetheless helpful to consider how significantly a knot of emission outside the agn in might be affecting our measure of the fwhm of the blr .",
    "the broadest component of our model is indeed consistent with highly broadened emission in the environment around the agn , with a fwhm of @xmath89  km  s@xmath11 , so a highly broadened non - blr emission component is already factored into our fit of the h@xmath24 complex .",
    "however , we tested for the possibility that the and non - blr h@xmath40 line profiles might deviate significantly from by freeing their widths and velocities and refitting the spectrum . freeing these parameters improved the fit , as expected , but the effect on the fwhm of the blr component was not significant , increasing it to 6790  km  s@xmath11 , with about a factor of 2 increase in the uncertainty . to remain conservative ,",
    "we retain our estimate of 6440  km  s@xmath11 for the fwhm of the blr , and we adopt a factor of 2 increase of the uncertainty , equal to the uncertainty of 200  km  s@xmath11 assumed by @xcite .",
    "we calculate the black hole mass as @xmath90 , where we adopt a virial coefficient of @xmath91 @xcite , which has an intrinsic scatter of 0.44  dex , and we calculate @xmath92  light - days with an uncertainty of 52% @xcite . propagating these uncertainties and the uncertainty of the fwhm of the broad h@xmath40 , @xmath93 , where the uncertainty is 1@xmath21 , consistent with the mass estimate from @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that while the @xmath41-@xmath42 relation from @xcite that we use has been shown to predict maser masses for several highly obscured agns like to a high degree of accuracy @xcite , there are some possible caveats .",
    "the objects studied in @xcite had typical @xmath41 luminosities of about @xmath94  , over an order of magnitude less luminous than . of the objects studied in @xcite with @xmath41 luminosities",
    "similar to , while most also have blr sizes of around @xmath95 light - days , there are some outliers .",
    "the most notable is ic  4392a , with a blr size of @xmath96  light - days , despite having @xmath97  .",
    "if has a blr of similar size , then its smbh has a mass of @xmath98 , and it is radiating very close to its eddington limit .",
    "this is inconsistent with its x - ray spectral properties , as we discuss in  [ sec : discussion ] , but moreover the blr size uncertainty for ic  4392a is very large , and as such it is not included in other works on the radius - luminosity relationship ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , other objects with similar @xmath41 luminosities to that have much smaller blr size uncertainties have blr sizes that are quite large , up to @xmath85  light - days . this being the case , the smbh in has a mass of @xmath99 .",
    "neither of these extremes is inconsistent with the 0.5  dex uncertainty that we have derived for our smbh mass , and the smbh may in fact be somewhat larger given the uncertainty associated with ic  4392a . with these considerations , we use the value of @xmath93 originally calculated , noting the caveats detailed above .",

    ", the bat agn is hosted in the more massive galaxy , and the sole exception ( ngc  3758 ) is a major merger ( stellar mass ratio of 1:2 ) .",
    "we may gain some insight by comparing was  49 to results from a numerical simulation of a gas - rich minor merger @xcite .",
    "this simulation of a coplanar , minor ( 1:10 ) merger bears some resemblance to the was  49 system , given the apparent co - rotation of within the disk of , and the fact that the agn in the primary galaxy is largely quiescent throughout the merger .",
    "however , the secondary agn only rarely reaches high luminosities ( @xmath138  ) .",
    "@xcite also simulate a coplanar , 1:10 merger , and find similar results .",
    "however , these simulations assumed that the central bhs were initially on the @xmath139-@xmath140 relation : the @xcite relation in the case of former ; the @xcite relationship in the case of the latter .",

    "however , it is not clear how meaningful this scaling is , as the bulge mass of is about 30  times larger .",
    "moreover , while the bhs in these simulations were @xmath145 the mass of their host bulge as expected from scaling relations , the bh in is apparently over - massive , at about 2.3% .",
    "it is therefore not certain how well these numerical studies can inform our picture of the was  49 system .",
    "while the uncertainty on our smbh mass of 0.5  dex means that it is possible that the smbh is not as over - massive than the data suggests , we note that if does follow the above bh - galaxy scaling relations , then the agn would be radiating very near its eddington limit .",
    "however , the hard x - ray spectral index of @xmath146 implies that the agn is radiating at a small fraction of its eddington limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for example , the relation between the eddington ratio @xmath147 and @xmath37 from @xcite implies that the agn in is radiating at only @xmath148 of its eddington limit , and other relations between @xmath147 and @xmath37 from the literature consistently imply that the eddington ratio is only a few percent .",
    "given the bolometric luminosity calculated in  [ x - rayresults ] , the eddington ratio for a @xmath143   black hole is 0.08 , meaning that our mass estimate is generally consistent with the x - ray spectral index .",
    "conversely , for a smbh of @xmath149  , the host spheroid should have a mass of @xmath150  , using the same scaling relations as @xcite and @xcite , making the was  49 system a major merger , which is not the case , owing to two considerations .",
    "first , in a major merger between two disk galaxies , both disks are severely disrupted , while in minor mergers the disk of primary galaxy is left relatively unperturbed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is no known mechanism by which only one member of an equal - mass system can be stripped .",
    "second , while a stellar disk can reform following a major merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the was  49 merger is still ongoing , as is at a projected separation from of @xmath9  kpc .",
    "this implies that the disk of is the original .",
    "moreover , has a typical disk galaxy rotation curve @xcite , which strongly disfavors significant perturbation by .",
    "empirically , was  49 is not the only minor merger in which the smaller galaxy hosts the more luminous agn .",
    "for example , ngc  3341 is a minor merger composed of two dwarf galaxies merging with a giant disk galaxy .",
    "one of the dwarf galaxies , 1/25 the size of the primary galaxy , hosts an agn with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath151  , while the primary galaxy is likely quiescent @xcite .",
    "is 100 times more luminous , making it a unique system that may provide insight into the nature of minor - merger driven agn fueling .    as noted in  [ subsec : morphology ] , is a consistent with being a pseudobulge galaxy , a morphology with a distinctly different and largely merger - free origin , suggesting that it has not gone through any major mergers in the recent past .",
    "indeed , the was  49 system is isolated : a manual inspection of sdss images / spectra shows that there are no other major galaxies ( @xmath152 ) within @xmath1531,000 km  s@xmath11 with a projected distance closer than about 1  mpc .",
    ", being consistent with a de galaxy in terms of mass and light profile , may have once been a late - type disk galaxy that was transformed into an elliptical morphology via galaxy ` harassment ' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or it may have been a primordial tidal dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the isolation of the system , however , implies that whatever morphological changes underwent happened during the beginning of its encounter with , and so it has not been severely tidally stripped ( unlike , for example , the smbh - hosting ultracompact dwarf galaxy m60-ucd1 : * ? ? ?",
