    "chemistry is an important branch of science which treats change of matter .",
    "it explains , for example , why and how a protein works , the process @xmath0 converts to @xmath1 , _ etc .",
    "_ the goal is to predict , understand , and control what will happen when we mix some substances . to do that",
    ", we usually do experiments which can be explosive , poisonous , expensive and unstable .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to do chemistry without experiments . fortunately , the basic equation for chemistry is already known and it is called the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "it is possible to approximately solve the schrdinger equation using computers with various methods and algorithms .",
    "such branch of chemistry is called quantum chemistry and it is our main interest .    determining the exact or approximate solution to the schrdinger equation is the fundamental problem in quantum chemistry .",
    "this solution is called the _ wavefunction _ , or sometimes referred as _ electronic structure_.",
    "if we know the electronic structure , we can do chemistry",
    ". often such methods are referred as _ ab initio _",
    "( latin word which means `` from the beginning '' ) or the first principle method if approximations are not heuristic or do not employ parameters from experiments .    the _ ground state energy _",
    "calculation of a non - relativistic and time - independent , @xmath2-electron molecular system under the born - oppenheimer approximation is the most important problem @xcite .",
    "it can be obtained as the lowest eigenvalue @xmath3 of the electronic schrdinger equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the _ schrdinger operator _ or _ hamiltonian _ defined by    @xmath6",
    "in which @xmath7 is the atomic number of the nucleus @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the distance between the electron @xmath10 and nucleus @xmath8 , and @xmath11 is the distance between two distinct electrons .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) , @xmath12 in @xmath13 , @xmath14 with the inner product @xmath15 ( @xmath16 includes integration over spin variables ) , is the _ wavefunction _ , and the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath3 , the _ total energy _ of the system .    besides , since electrons are fermions , the wavefunction itself is antisymmetric due to pauli exclusion principle : @xmath17 that is to say , we must solve the schrdinger equation in the antisymmetric subspace of @xmath13 .",
    "we denote such space as @xmath18 .",
    "even on computers , treating the @xmath2-particle wavefunction is very difficult .",
    "thus , we discretize the hilbert space @xmath18 by taking antisymmetric products of the one - particle hilbert space @xmath19 , whose complete orthonormal system ( cons ) is @xmath20 .",
    "each @xmath21 is called _ single - electron wavefunctions _ or _ spin orbitals _",
    "@xmath22 we can explicitly construct a cons of @xmath18 using @xmath20 by the slater determinants defined as follows @xcite : @xmath23here , we used an ordered set of indices @xmath24 .",
    "it is known that @xmath25 is a cons of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a second approximation to solve the schrdinger equation would be choose carefully @xmath26 functions from a cons @xmath20 by chemical or physical intuition .",
    "then we construct a subspace of @xmath18 by the slater determinants considering all possible combinations of @xmath2 spin orbitals among @xmath26 possibilities . in this case , solving the schrdinger equation becomes the eigenvalue problem of the hamiltonian matrix which now seems to be feasible on computers .",
    "nevertheless , the dimension of the problem becomes @xmath27 which obviously is impractical even for small values .",
    "the ( approximate ) ground state energy obtained by this procedure is considered the reference value , and called _ full configuration iteration _",
    "( full ci ) ( energy ) .",
    "the mainstream approaches in quantum chemistry can be roughly interpreted as linear or nonlinear approximations of this eigenvalue problem , , hartree - fock method , second - order perturbation methods , coupled cluster methods , truncated ci methods , _ etc . _",
    "our main motivation is employ the second - order reduced density matrix ( 2-rdm ) as the basic variable for quantum mechanics to construct simpler methods .",
    "since only two - body interactions exist in nature , we can calculate all observables using the 2-rdm .",
    "moreover , the number of variables of the 2-rdm is always four , regardless of the number of electrons in the system ( @xmath28 when discretized ) , whereas the wavefunction scales like @xmath2 ( @xmath29 when discretized ) .",
    "this chapter is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we define the first - order and second - order reduced density matrices , and introduce the notion of @xmath2-representability and its conditions .",
    "the reduced - density - matrix method is a viable implementation to approximate the ground state energy of molecular systems .",
    "the reduced - density - matrix method is formulated as an semidefinite program in section  3 , and its numerical results using a parallel optimization code is given in section  5 . in section  4 , we give a brief historical note of this approach .",
    "finally in section  6 , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "most generally , a quantum system containing @xmath2 particles is described by the density matrix @xmath30 which was introduced independently by von neumann , landau , and bloch , and is an ensemble average of wavefunctions , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a cons of an @xmath2-particle state . for a pure state where the system is described by the wavefunction @xmath35",
    ", @xmath30 can be written by @xmath36 this is equivalent to requiring @xmath30 to be idempotent ; @xmath37 .",
    "hereafter , when we refer to a state , it means be an ensemble if not otherwise specified .",
    "we are mainly interested in the pure state but usually we do not care about whether @xmath30 is a pure or ensemble .",
    "this only becomes a problem when the system is degenerated or we consider its subsystems .",
    "given an ensemble @xmath38 , the _ first - order reduced density matrix _ ( 1-rdm ) @xcite is defined by @xmath39 the _ second - order reduced density matrix _ ( 2-rdm ) @xcite is given by @xmath40 and higher - order rdms are defined in an analogous way .",
    "the normalization factor for the @xmath41-th order reduced density matrix is then @xmath42 .",
    "the second - quantized versions are defined using a set of creation and annihilation operators @xmath43 , where @xmath44 creates and @xmath45 annihilates a particle at @xmath46 of @xmath30 as follows @xcite : @xmath47 the normalization factor for the @xmath41-th order reduced density matrix is @xmath48 for this case .",
    "the equivalence of these two different expressions can be found by @xmath49 where we used the single - particle wave function @xmath50 of ( [ eq : basis ] ) .",
    "the following conditions are inherited by these definitions :    \\(1 ) the 1-rdm and 2-rdm are hermitian , @xmath51    \\(2 ) the 2-rdm is antisymmetric ,",
    "@xmath52    \\(3 ) trace conditions are valid , @xmath53    \\(4 ) a partial trace condition holds between the 1-rdm and 2-rdm , @xmath54    additionally , we can find more conditions from the symmetry of the system .",
    "in particular , the spin symmetry of the ( ground state ) molecular systems is important and formulated as follows :    \\(5 ) the total spin @xmath55 ; the 2-rdm should be the eigenstate of spin operator @xmath56where @xmath55 is defined as follows : @xmath57 the indices @xmath58 , @xmath59 means that we choose spin eigenfunctions of the @xmath60-axis for @xmath50 , and reorder them so that @xmath10 means @xmath10-th spacial function and @xmath61 , @xmath62 denote eigenfunctions of @xmath61-spin and @xmath62-spin ; @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "\\(6 ) the @xmath60-component of the spin , @xmath64 can be chosen as integer or half integer , @xmath65    in the subsequent discussion , one will notice that the 1-rdm can be disregarded throughout . however , we explicitly use it in order to prioritize the compactness of the notation",
    ".      the hamiltonian of the most general form in second - quantization can be written by : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are one- and two - particle terms which can be calculated from the molecular hamiltonian ( [ eq : molehamiltonian ] ) by the slater s rule as follows : @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the distance between an electron and a nucleus .",
    "then , the total energy @xmath3 can be expressed using @xmath30 as follows : @xmath72 the ground state energy @xmath73 can be calculated minimizing the total energy over 1- and 2-rdms .",
    "@xmath74 it is easy to show that this minimization ( [ eq : wfmin ] ) is equivalent to solve the schrdinger equation for the ground state , and often such kind of methods are called variational methods .",
    "moreover , ( [ eq : rdmmin ] ) is also equivalent to solve the schrdinger equation for the ground state .",
    "advantage of using 1- and 2-rdms instead of @xmath30 is that the number of variables are reduced drastically .      in 1950",
    "s , researchers based on the above facts chose the 1- and 2-rdms as basic variables , and did some variational calculations ; according to lwdin @xcite , f. london , j. e. mayer , a. j. coleman , p. o. lwdin , r. mcweeny , n. a. march , c. a. coulson and others have attempt to minimize via ( [ eq : rdmmin ] ) . however , their results were considerably lower than the true energy .",
    "the reason is that the trial 2-rdms were not actually derived from an existing density matrix @xmath30 .",
    "we need some more conditions on the trial 2-rdm to ensure that it comes from a true @xmath30",
    ". such formalism of the problem was first described by a.  j.  coleman in 1963 and named _",
    "@xmath2-representability problem _ , and these conditions are known to be the _",
    "@xmath2-representability conditions _",
    "@xcite ; given a trial @xmath41-th order rdm @xmath75 , if there exists some wavefunction or ensemble which reduces to the @xmath41-th order rdm @xmath75 , then this @xmath75 is pure or ensemble @xmath2-representable , respectively .      given a 1- and 2-rdm , they should satisfy the relations @xmath76 to @xmath77 of section  2.2 the 1- and 2-rdm for the ground state should additionally satisfy @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , these conditions are necessary conditions for the @xmath2-representability . unfortunately , these conditions are not sufficient , thus early attempts failed and obtained very low energy .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the 1-rdm is relatively easy @xcite .",
    "however , the complete ( sufficient ) @xmath2-representability of the 2-rdm is very complicated in general .",
    "garrod and percus @xcite showed that the 2-rdm @xmath80 is ensemble @xmath2-representable if and only if @xmath81 where @xmath82 is every possible hamiltonian and @xmath83 is the ground state energy corresponds to @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the ensemble @xmath2-representable set @xmath84 can be defined by : @xmath85this result is theoretical and very important , but totally not practical since if one wants to calculate the _ exact _ ground state energy of a hamiltonian , then he / she must know the exact ground state energy of the system beforehand .",
    "this is a tautology ! after that , many researchers seek the complete @xmath2-representability condition , and did not succeed .",
    "a meaningful result from complexity theory was obtained by liu _",
    "et al_. @xcite in 2007 .",
    "they showed that the computational complexity of the @xmath2-representability problem is qma - complete , which is the quantum generalization of np - completeness .",
    "thus it is almost hopeless to find an efficient algorithm to decide whether a given 2-rdm is @xmath2-representable or not . we can consider a more physical example : the ground state problem of the spin - glass hamiltonian",
    "is known to be a very hard problem , and equivalent to solve the max - cut problem or the traveling sales person problem , which in turn are known to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "if the complete @xmath2-representability conditions were easy to handle , we could solve such difficult problems in computer science as well .",
    "currently we do not know how to solve these problems efficiently .",
    "we just want to stress , the complete @xmath2-representability is a really hard problem .",
    "the problem we want to solve can be formulated using the 1- and 2-rdms as basic variables , @xmath86    @xmath84 is known to be a compact convex set .",
    "besides , all possible hamiltonians and the corresponding ground state energies serves as a characterization of this convex set . to be more precise ,",
    "a 2-rdm corresponding to the ground state of an @xmath2-particle hamiltonian is a surface point , and any surface point of @xmath84 corresponds to the ground state of some hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the compact and convex set of the @xmath2-representable set is represented as an ellipse ( we do not show , but there are also cusp points as well ) in fig . [",
    "fig : nrep ] .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , and their ground state energies @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 serves as @xmath2-representability conditions , respectively .",
    "-representable set ; a hamiltonian and its ground state energy serves as a characterization of the set . ]",
    "we should not be demotivated by the facts of the previous subsection .",
    "understanding the chemical and/or physical meaning of the necessary @xmath2-representability conditions is much more important .",
    "mathematical theorems do not tell about chemistry or physics . in practice , @xmath2-representability conditions for the molecular systems might not be so difficult .",
    "we seek for chemically and/or physically meaningful necessary @xmath2-representability conditions on the 1- and 2-rdms .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for an ensemble @xmath2-representability for the 1-rdm is characterized by its eigenvalues lying between 0 and 1 @xcite . for the pure state , it is more complicated @xcite .",
    "coleman introduced two necessary conditions called the @xmath95 and @xmath96 conditions @xcite .",
    "these conditions require the positive semidefiniteness of the @xmath95-matrix ( @xmath80 ) , and the @xmath96-matrix @xmath97 another important necessary condition is called the @xmath98 condition @xcite , which also require positive semidefiniteness of the @xmath98-matrix defined as follows @xmath99 in the original paper by garrod - percus , the definition of the @xmath98-matrix is non - linear : @xmath100 but for a fixed particle state , these @xmath98-matrices share the same eigenvalues , since @xmath101 can be replaced with @xmath102 @xcite . in zhao _ et al _ @xcite , we can find explicitly formula of @xmath103 and @xmath104 conditions from erdahl s survey paper @xcite : @xmath105 which are stronger conditions .",
    "an important property of these matrices is that @xmath96 , @xmath98 , @xmath103 and @xmath104-matrices can be written _ only _ by linear combinations of the 2-rdm elements like following : @xmath106   { \\cal a } [ \\ell , m , n ] ( \\frac{1}{6 } \\delta^{i}_{\\ell } \\delta^{j}_{m } \\delta^{k}_{n }   - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{i}_{\\ell } \\delta^{j}_{m } \\gamma^{k}_{n }   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\delta^{i}_{\\ell }",

    "the @xmath110 condition replaces the @xmath104 condition and is slightly strengthened by the addition of the one - particle operator @xcite .",
    "other positive semidefinite type representability conditions are known such as the @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , they are implied by the @xmath98 condition @xcite .",
    "we can extend these conditions to positive semidefiniteness of higher order rdms .",
    "these extensions seems to be known for a long time .",
    "erdahl and jin @xcite formulated the @xmath41-th order approximation to the @xmath2-particle density matrix in terms of the semidefiniteness conditions on the @xmath41-th order rdms , which is an generalization of the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 , @xmath103 and @xmath113 conditions .",
    "we call as the _ reduced - density - matrix method _ , the variational method having the 2-rdm ( and the 1-rdm ) as the basic variable(s ) restricted to some approximation @xmath114 of the @xmath2-representability set @xmath84",
    ". it can be formulated as follows : @xmath115 among the possibilities , we usually consider the set obtained by imposing some necessary conditions for the @xmath2-representability .",

    "compact set , so that a linear functional ( the hamiltonian ) has a minimum .",
    "* convex set , so that the solution would not be stuck into local minima . * stringent , so that resultant 2-rdm should be physically or chemically meaningful .",
    "* computationally feasible and/or efficient .",
    "* completely general : since the form of the hamiltonian is totally general , it is not only applicable to chemistry but also to physics . *",
    "_ ab initio _ : no empirical parameters .",
    "currently very successful methods based on the density functional theories employ a lot of empirical parameters .",
    "we can find new @xmath2-representability conditions from chemical or physical requirements satisfying the above properties by constructing a hamiltonian and obtaining an upper bound to the ground state energy .",
    "then we can add this as a new condition .",

    "these variational energies have the following property :    * if we add more necessary conditions , the calculated energy usually becomes better and would never become worse : @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the variational energy with the @xmath95 and @xmath96 conditions , @xmath120 is the variational energy with the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 conditions , _ etc .",

    "this property is totally _ opposite _ from traditional wavefunction approaches .",
    "variational calculation using the wavefunction gives upper bounds , and approximation to the total energy becomes lower ( better ) when the variational space becomes larger .",
    "note that the obtained 2-rdm may not be unique , even when the original problem is non - degenerated and the energy is unique .",
    "-representable sets ; a better set shrinks . ]",
    "we usually enforce only the necessary conditions on the trial 2-rdms .",
    "therefore , the rdm method gives lower bounds to the exact energy , an @xmath2-representable 1-rdm and a non - physical 2-rdms .",
    "thus it is important to realize the physical meaning of the necessary conditions employed in the calculations .",
    "the following results may be useful to interpret results from actual calculations on molecules and atoms :    \\(a ) if a trial 2-rdm @xmath80 satisfies the @xmath95 and @xmath96 conditions , the original 2-rdm is ensemble @xmath2-representable @xcite .",

    "moreover coleman proved that the agp ( anti - symmetrized power ) wavefunctions covers all such 1-rdms @xcite .",
    "thus if these conditions apply to the systems , we always obtain pure representable 1-rdms with necessary @xmath2-representability conditions .",

    "the restriction of the @xmath2-representability problem only on the diagonal elements of the 2-rdm , known as the _ diagonal problem _ , were investigated by weinhold and wilson @xcite , davidson @xcite , mcrae - davidson @xcite , and yoseloff @xcite since late 1960 s . other progresses on this topic",
    "can be found in the survey @xcite .",
    "the first variational calculation on the 2-rdm imposing the necessary @xmath2-representability conditions for the doubly ionized carbon c@xmath185 @xmath186 were performed by kijewski and co - authors since late 1960 s @xcite ( see earlier reference therein ) .",
    "garrod and co - authors proposed several algorithms , some of them which resemble modern optimization algorithms , and reported results for the beryllium ( @xmath187 ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , mihailovi and rosina applied it to nuclear physics @xcite , but obtained large deviations to the full ci calculations if compared to electronic systems .    in the 1978 survey paper of erdahl @xcite",
    ", we can find the conditions which is knows as @xmath103 , @xmath104 @xcite , and @xmath113 conditions @xcite .",
    "he also proposed algorithms based on the exact mathematical characterization of solutions of the lower bound method ( rdm method ) in the next year @xcite .",
    "these were the golden ages for the rdm research , but somehow faded away because it was realized soon that the underlying problem is computationally difficult and poor results were obtained for nuclear systems .    a revival of the 2-rdm approach appeared since 1992 due to valdemoro @xcite , nakatsuji and yasuda @xcite , and mazziotti @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the density equation or the contracted schrdinger equation ( cse ) , which is equivalent to solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "nakatsuji proved that if an @xmath2-representable 4-rdm satisfies the cse , then the original @xmath30 satisfies the schrdinger equation and vice versa @xcite .",
    "valdemoro , nakatsuji - yasuda and mazziotti consider the 2-rdm as the basic variable .",
    "the cse requires 1- to 4-rdms , thus they reconstruct 3- and 4-rdms using 1- and 2-rdms and solve the cse iteratively . in this approach",
    ", they assume the resultant 2-rdm is nearly @xmath2-representable because the reconstruction functional is physically relevant ; they did not explicitly impose any @xmath2-representability conditions .",
    "their results are quite good , and can be compared to single and double ci for small atoms and molecules such as @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 .",
    "the absolute values of negative eigenvalues of the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath98-matrices were small .",
    "however , researchers payed little attention to this approach since non - convergence or divergence occur especially where the correlations are strong @xcite .",
    "there are difficulties in systematic refinements of the reconstruction functional even though some improvements are reported @xcite , but there are even more miscellaneous problems @xcite .    in 2001 , nakata _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were the first to employ an optimization software to solve the rdm method s problem as an sdp , and reported computational results imposing the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath98 conditions on a series of small atoms and molecules .",
    "the results were better than the sdci calculations , and obtained correlation energies from 100% to 120% . as mentioned in section  [ subsec : sdp ] , these results have a numerical certificate of correctness , which could not be obtained before the advent of interior - point methods .",
    "also , the numerical convergence does not depend on the initial guess as it is common in hartree - fock , ccsd methods , _ etc .",
    "_ moreover , there exists a global minimum , whereas this is not guaranteed in the cse approach for instance . in the next year , nakata _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed results for the dissociation limit for several molecules including triple bonded @xmath191 , demonstrating numerically that the rdm method do not break down as the single reference methods such as ccsd and perturbation methods .",
    "however , it was also shown that size consistency is slightly deviated .",
    "the inclusion of the weinhold - wilson inequalities @xcite , which was not satisfied only including the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath98 conditions @xcite , however showed little progress in the results @xcite .    in 2002 , mazziotti immediately reproduced nakata _",

    "they noted a `` spectacular increase in accuracy '' and results were comparable to ccsd(t ) ; typically the correlation energies for various atoms and molecules were between 100% to 101% @xcite .",
    "in the same year , mazziotti announced the rrsdp method @xcite in which he reformulates the sdp problem as an nonlinear and nonconvex problem and applies a quasi - newton method to solve it @xcite . in 2006 , cancs _ et al . _",
    "proposed and implemented the dual problem of ( [ eq : approx ] ) @xcite .",

    "the ground state energy differences to full ci of the rdm method imposing the @xmath204 or @xmath205 , and of hartree - fock for the 57 atomic or molecular systems @xcite and those 5 shown at table  [ tab : new1 ] are plotted in figure  [ fig : dif1 ] .",
    "each horizontal bar corresponds to a system and they are ordered accordingly to the order it appears in the tables .",

    "apparently , it does not seems to exist an correlation between the hartree - fock and the rdm method s results .",
    "however , we clearly notice that the imposing the @xmath204 conditions , we can obtain results much better than the hartree - fock s ones .    figure  [ fig : dif2 ] shows the ground state energy differences to full ci of the rdm method imposing the @xmath205 ( same value as figure  [ fig : dif1 ] ) or @xmath207 , and of ccsd(t ) for the 57 atomic or molecular systems @xcite and those 5 shown at table  [ tab : new1 ] ( notice that we do not have the values for @xmath205 entries for this case ) .    , or @xmath207 conditions , and those obtained by ccsd(t ) for the 57 atomic and molecular systems of [ 45 ] and the 5 of table  [ tab : new1 ] . ]",
    "if you compare the rdm method with @xmath207 conditions and the ccsd(t ) values , they seems equally good .",
    "however , in some case ccsd(t ) can fails to converge .",
    "there are 4 case in @xcite which are replaced by zero in figure  [ fig : dif2 ] .",
    "the largest deviation of 0.00279 hartree to full ci for ccsd(t ) is for the oxygen atom at the @xmath208 state @xcite .",
    "in this chapter , we showed the outline of the reduced - density - matrix method with applications to atomic and molecular fermionic systems .",
    "some feature of this method are : ( i ) it is an _ ab initio _ method , which is rigorously the same as the schrdinger equation for the ground state ; ( ii ) the number of variables is always four , regardless of the size of the system ; ( iii ) from the sparsity of the first- and second- order reduced density matrices the existence of a linear scaling method is apparent .",
    "the major obstacle for this method is the fundamentally difficulty of obtaining the complete @xmath2-representability conditions for the 2-rdm .",
    "however we know fairly good approximated ( necessary ) condition like @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 , @xmath103 and @xmath113 conditions which reproduces comparable ground state energies to ccsd(t ) , which is considered the golden standard method in quantum chemistry .",
    "the considered problem becomes a semidefinite programming problem , which minimizes a linear functional keeping the eigenvalues of matrices non - negative . in this chapter , we presented new results ; @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 using a supercomputer with a highly efficient semidefinite programming solver , sdpara .",
