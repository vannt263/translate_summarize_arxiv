    "the key result that permits the explicit calculation of @xmath42 is that the joint occupation probability distribution of the system factorizes into poisson distributions . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we show how this comes about .",
    "we require the determination of the joint occupation probability distribution , that is , the probability @xmath81 of finding @xmath82 particles , at the sites @xmath83 respectively at time @xmath84 , with the boundary conditions described in the text .",
    "the evolution equation for this quantity is @xmath85 where @xmath86 and we recall that @xmath2 . equation ( [ long ] ) looks messy , but it is actually very easy to understand : if we consider the lhs of this equation without the delta functions , we note that it contains all the possible events from all the possible configurations at time @xmath84 , weighted by the probability that the events occur .",
    "the deltas restrict this immense sum to the terms which end up in the occupancy configuration specified on the rhs of the equation .    in expression ( [ long ] )",
    "we have already imposed poisson occupancy distributions with concentrations @xmath6 and @xmath87 on the sites @xmath88 and @xmath89 as boundary conditions for the system .",
    "this will enable us to drive the system into `` nonequilibrium '' steady states by imposing different concentrations on the boundary , or considering biased random walks ( i.e. @xmath90 ) , or both .",
    "this evolution equation can be dealt with by evaluating the multivariate generating function of the joint distribution , namely : @xmath91 after some simple but tedious algebra , which consists in regrouping terms and adding up binomial expansions , the generating function can be shown to satisfy the recursion relation @xmath92^{m_{0}}[q+z_{2}p+z_{1}r]^{m_{1}}\\\\\\nonumber & \\times&[z_{l-1}q+p+z_{l}r]^{m_{l}}[1+(z_{l}-1)q]^{m_{l+1}}\\\\ \\nonumber & \\times&\\prod_{i=2}^{l-1}[z_{i+1}p+z_{i-1}q+z_{i}r]^{m_{i}}.         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with the definition of the generating function , we note that this expression is equivalent to @xmath93    to solve this equation we make the ansatz that the distribution is given by the product of poisson distributions , and thus , its generating function can be written as @xmath94 substitution of this expression into eq.([occ - rec ] ) leads to the following equations for the mean occupation numbers @xmath95 which characterize the poisson distributions at each site : @xmath96=c_{0}[1-z_{0}]+ c_{l+1}[1-z_{l+1 } ] + c_{0}(t)p[1-z_{1}]+ c_{1}(t)[1-(z_{2}p+q+z_{1}r)]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum\\limits_{i=2}^{l-1}c_{i}(t)[1-(z_{i+1}p+z_{i-1}q+z_{i}r ) ] + c_{l}(t)[1-(z_{l-1}q+p+z_{l}r ) ] + c_{l+1}(t)q[1-z_{l}]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we now impose the boundary conditions @xmath97 and @xmath98 for all times @xmath84 , the above equation may be rewritten as @xmath99z_{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which must be valid for all values of the variables @xmath100 .",
    "this is achieved if , in addition to the boundary conditions , the parameters @xmath95 satisfy the discrete diffusion equation @xmath101 thus , if we have an ensemble of systems in which each site is initially occupied according to independent poisson distributions , then the occupancy distribution will remain being the product of poisson distributions throughout the evolution of the process .    furthermore , independently of the initial conditions",
    ", the system will reach a unique stationary state characterized by the product distribution with the parameters @xmath26 solutions of the stationary state of equation ( [ conc - diff ] ) :      with this expression , we can calculate the explicit values of the mean flux and its variance as functions of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , the imposed boundary concentrations @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and , for the variance , the position along the system : @xmath102\\ ] ]                            this is a natural choice of boundary conditions if we wish to model contacts with a chemical baths at equilibrium , for which the number of particles is poisson distributed in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "further , as shown in the appendix , this choice allows the exact factorizability of the joint occupancy distribution ."

    "<S> we calculate the explicit probability distribution function for the flux between sites a in a simple discrete - time diffusive system composed by independent random walkers . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight some of the features of the distribution and we discuss its relation to the local instantaneous entropy production in the system . </S>",
    "<S> our results are applicable both to equilibrium and non equilibrium steady states as well as for certain time dependent situations .    </S>",
    "<S> random walkers are used extensively as phenomenological models for diffusive processes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between physical diffusion and random walks arises from the fact that the concentration in a system containing many identical independent random walkers satisfies fick s law . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the mean flux between sites is proportional to the difference in the mean number of walkers at each site , plus , perhaps , a convective term if the walks are not symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> however , to the best of our knowledge , the statistics of the flux in such a system have not been characterized ( beyond the mean , of course ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case in more complicated systems , for which a large amount of work on the statistics of currents has been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> recent examples include statistics and large deviation theory for the fluctuations of the current in lattice gases @xcite ; the integrated current distribution for the steady - state of the one - dimensional zero - range process @xcite ; the joint probability function for the occupation number and the current through the system in the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries @xcite , to mention but a few .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to being an alternative approach to the description of transport properties of simple diffusive systems , the statistics of flux are of relevance in many diffusion limited processes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a diffusion reaction system in which the reactants are initially separated , fluctuations in the flux of reactants into the interfacial region give rise to fluctuations in the position of the reaction front and in the net reaction kinetics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , viewed from the thermodynamic side , there has been a great deal of work relating the statistics of flux to the entropy production of non equilibrium steady states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> from this perspective , diffusive systems modeled by random walkers are among the simplest examples that can be used to test and extend such ideas .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an explicit expression for the probability distribution of the flux , that is , the net number of particles that hop between neighboring sites in a given time step , in a system containing independent discrete time random walkers . </S>",
    "<S> this system has the added bonus that the results are applicable to both equilibrium and non - equilibrium situations , where the latter can be achieved by imposing concentration differences on the boundaries or by subjecting the system to an external field ( by considering biased random walkers ) or both .    for definiteness , </S>",
    "<S> in this work we consider a discrete one dimensional system in which independent discrete time random walkers evolve synchronously according to the following rules : at each time step , a walker moves to the site on its right or to the site on its left with probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , or stays at its site with probability @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the discreteness in time allows us to consider fluxes that arise from the simultaneous hopping of many particles . </S>",
    "<S> such multiparticle events are not present in continuous time versions of the system ; we discuss the continuous limit of the problem further on .    </S>",
    "<S> the system in which the random walkers evolve consists of @xmath3 sites and we impose as boundary conditions that the number of walkers at sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 be poisson distributed with fixed mean values @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    to compute the probability distribution of particle flux between neighboring sites , labeled @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we require @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the number of particles that jump from site @xmath8 to site @xmath9 and the number of particles that jump from @xmath9 to @xmath8 respectively . in terms of these , the total flux @xmath12 between these sites will be given by @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath14 and @xmath15 the ocupancy of sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then , the probability that the net flux between these sites is @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of finding exactly @xmath14 and @xmath15 particles at sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath18 is the probability of having a total flux @xmath12 between these sites given those occupancy numbers .    </S>",
    "<S> since the walkers are independent , we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the probabilities that @xmath10 particles jump to the right from a site containing @xmath14 particles and @xmath11 particles jump to the left from a site containing @xmath15 particles .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , it will prove useful to work with the generating function of expression ( [ two ] ) , defined as @xmath22 , which is given by @xmath23    next , we note that this system has the remarkable property that the joint probability distribution @xmath17 of the occupancy numbers factorizes into a product of poisson distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this property is analogous to the factorization of the steady state occupancy distribution which occurs in certain zero range processes under similar boundary conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the joint occupancy distribution @xmath17 can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the mean number of particles at site @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , under certain circumstances , namely initial conditions already characterized by independent poisson distributions , the joint occupancy distribution can be expressed as the product of poisson distributions throughout the evolution of the system . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the mean occupation numbers can be obtained as the solution to the discrete diffusion equation @xmath27 with appropriate initial and boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , just as for zero range processes @xcite , the system always reaches a unique factorizable steady state , independently of the initial conditions , for which the parameters @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 , \\label{steady}\\ ] ] which is the steady state solution of equation ( [ conc ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are in a position to evaluate the generating function @xmath30 of the distribution of fluxes between sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath31 from this expression , the moments and the cumulants of the distribution may be readily evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> for example , all the odd cumulants are given by @xmath32 whereas the even cumulants are @xmath33 in particular , using the explicit expression for the concentration profile for the steady states given in equation ( [ steady ] ) , we find @xmath34\\ ] ] and @xmath35\\ ] ] furthermore , using the explicit expressions for the moments we can calculate the skewness @xmath36 and excess ( or kurtosis ) @xmath37 of the distribution , which are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 thus , only in the limit @xmath40 is the distribution of flux essentially gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the expression for @xmath41 can be inverted to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath42 . rewriting @xmath43,\\ ] ] and comparing with the generating function of the modified bessel functions @xcite @xmath44 = \\sum_{s=-\\infty}^{\\infty}i_{s}(x)t^{s},\\ ] ] yields @xmath45^{\\frac{j}{2}}i_{j }   ( 2\\sqrt{pqc_{i}c_{i+1}}).\\label{dist}\\ ] ] this distribution , shown in fig.[fig ] , shares some of the properties of the gaussian distribution : it is characterized by only two parameters , say @xmath46 and @xmath47 in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it satisfies a generalized stability condition , in the sense that the distribution of the sum of independent ( integer ) random variables distributed according to @xmath48 , has the same form as @xmath48 with appropriately rescaled parameters . that this is the case is obvious from the explicit expression of the generating function , but it could have been foreseen from the actual process we are describing . indeed , the complete derivation presented above applies also for the distribution of flux between adjacent cell in systems of arbitrary dimension . for these </S>",
    "<S> , the one dimensional system we are considering corresponds to a projection onto one of the axes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the flux distribution we obtain can itself be thought of as that of the sum of many independent fluxes with distributions similar to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    the large @xmath49 behavoir of @xmath42 , which is where it most clearly differs from the gaussian , is easily amenable to evaluation . from the series expansion of the bessel functions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we immediately find that @xmath50    another limiting behavior of @xmath42 worth mentioning is that corresponding to the continuous time limit . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is achieved by assuming that the hopping probabilities can be expressed as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the time interval between succesive steps . then , keeping only the terms up to linear order in @xmath53 we find @xmath54 all other values of @xmath12 have probabilities of higher order in @xmath55 and are , therefore , negligible as @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the above expression merely reflects the fact that in the continuum limit , the transport of particles amongst neighboring sites during a time interval @xmath53 is , at most , a single particle process . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical parameters in this limit can be calculated directly from the expressions obtained above ; thus , for example , the mean number of particles that flow from site @xmath8 to site @xmath9 in a time interval @xmath53 is @xmath57 as was to be expected .    </S>",
    "<S> a further characteristic that @xmath42 shares with the gaussian distribution is that the ratio @xmath58 is a pure exponential . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is of interest because it can be associated to entropy production of non - equilibrium steady states . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , given the explicit form of @xmath42 between sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a system , and the symmetry properties of the bessel functions , we have : @xmath59 the average of this quantity is @xmath60 which has the familiar non - negative form that appears in the _ h_-theorem , and that we argue can be considered as an instantaneous local entropy production for this system . </S>",
    "<S> it should be remarked that this is not the same quantity that appears in the fluctuation theorems @xcite , which are concerned with the large fluctuations of the time - integrated flux .    </S>",
    "<S> also , from the definition of @xmath61 in equation ( [ s ] ) it is again apparent that this quantity is a random variable , the statistics of which are simply related to the statistics of flux described above . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for example , the variance of @xmath61 will be given by @xmath62 ^ 2\\ ] ] to justify our identification of @xmath63 as an average local entropy production , first note that the equilibrium for this system is defined as the steady state with zero average flux . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , the concentration profile will be given by @xmath64 where @xmath6 is the concentration imposed on the boundary site @xmath4 . on the other hand , from the thermodynamic perspective the system corresponds to noninteracting particles in an external field @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> for such a system the concentration profile is given by the barometric equation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the chemical potential and @xmath68 is the inverse temperature . </S>",
    "<S> comparing both expressions for the concentration profiles at equilibrium leads to the identification @xmath69 of course , in general the system is not in equilibrium ; however , since the occupancy is characterized by independent poisson distributions , it can be considered as being in local equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can rewrite equation ( [ entropy ] ) as : @xmath70=-\\langle    j\\rangle_i\\left[\\delta_i\\beta\\left(\\mu_i+\\phi(i)\\right )    \\right],\\label{prod}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is a `` potential energy '' and @xmath72 is the difference operator . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ prod ] ) is a discrete analog of the local entropy production of linear thermodynamics .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that the average entropy production proposed in equation ( [ entropy ] ) is obtained from a _ single _ step local statistic . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this quantity should be interpreted as the entropy produced at that time step , averaged over an ensemble of statistically identical systems , which is the usual interpretation of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially relevant in the time dependent case , for which all of the above results also hold , as mentioned above , given that the initially the sites of each system of the ensemble are occupied according to independent poisson distributions . for these it makes no sense to study time averaged quantities of single systems and relate the results to the ensemble averages </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , in the steady state the ensemble average of @xmath61 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ s ] ) , will coincide with the time average of the flux in a single system , yielding the connection usually assumed by the ergodic hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> . this will not be true for higher moments of @xmath61 due to correlations in the flux at different times .    if we restrict ourselves to the steady states , the average flux is constant and we can calculate the total entropy production in the system as @xmath73 \\left[(l+1)\\ln\\left(p / q\\right)+\\ln\\left(c_0/c_{l+1}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the concentrations imposed on the boundaries of the system and we used the explicit expression for the steady state flux given in equation ( [ steady ] ) . in particular , if we take the limit @xmath74 , the above expression coincides with that obtained in @xcite , where the entropy production is interpreted in terms of a time asymmetry in the dynamical randomness between the forward and backward paths of the diffusion process @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the limit in which @xmath75 say , is worth discussing . </S>",
    "<S> this totally asymmetric hopping case is again of some importance in the context of zero range processes . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of flux in this case is easy to evaluate from the explicit expression in equation ( [ dist ] ) , from which we obtain @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath42 is poissonian with mean @xmath78 for @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> further , as discussed above , a field can be associated to the @xmath80 , which gives rise to a `` potential energy '' ; thus , in the limit when @xmath1 vanishes , motion against the field is impossible and motion along the field `` dissipates '' an infinite amount of energy . in accordance , the mean entropy production diverges in this limit .    in summary , we have obtained the explicit probability distribution function of single step flux between adjacent sites in a diffusive system composed of independent discrete random walkers . </S>",
    "<S> the key to solving the problem is the fact that the joint site occupancy distribution for this system factorizes into independent poisson distributions even in non equilibrium situations . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the statistical parameters that characterize the distribution and discuss some of its limiting behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we use the distribution to evaluate a single step local entropy production , whose average can be related to the usual expressions from nonequilibrium thermodynamics . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> an interesting extension of this work would be to introduce an additional conserved quantity which can be distributed among the random walkers at each site . </S>",
    "<S> this energy - like quantity may or may not affect the jumping rates ( although from a physical perspective it probably should ) , and would allow the study of coupled transport phenomena in these extremely simple settings . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus far been unable to pose such scenario in a tractable manner . </S>",
    "<S> a different avenue of research would be to determine multiple time and site flux statistics in systems containing many random walkers , characterizing , for example , the correlations in flux at two sites of the system as a function of time .    </S>",
