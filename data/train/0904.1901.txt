    "most of living species are exposed to random fluctuations in their environment in the nature .",
    "environment change can either be periodic , such as day - night interchanges , or be stochastic , such as nutrition supplements in random times .",
    "thus how can a life - form adapt to the fluctuating environment to optimize its fitness within is critical for the species to survive in the nature  @xcite .",
    "recently , with the progresses in the study of the gene regulation networks , the stochastic nature of the gene expression is revealed  @xcite , which is soon considered to further understand optimized fitness of cells .",
    "stochastic gene expression brings the isogenic population to distinct phenotypes which is known as phenotypic heterogeneity  @xcite .",
    "phenotypic heterogeneity is a useful strategy for species to adapt to the fluctuating environment  @xcite . with this concept , various phenomena , including the bacterial persistence  @xcite and optimized growth rate for the cells living in the fluctuating environment  @xcite , were studied .",
    "these authors also considered comparison between the strategy of the heterogeneity in which the switching rate from the fit state to the unfit states in an environment of specific parameters is nonzero and the homogeneity in which the switching rate mentioned above is zero  @xcite , the effects of the static ( switching rates do not change with environment ) and dynamic ( switching rates change with environment ) transition between states  @xcite , and the influence of the switching rates on the environment changing rate  @xcite , which are all important for the understanding of the survival of species on earth .",
    "besides the stochastic gene expression , another important feature of gene regulation networks is time - delay .",
    "a time delay usually results from regulated transcription and translation , and leads to behaviors quite different from those without  @xcite . in more complex gene networks ,",
    "some motifs , such as feed - forward loops and gene cascades , induce time - delays of length even longer than a cell cycle  @xcite .",
    "these time - delays have important effects on gene regulatory networks , and there were some assumption that cells can benefit from their time - delay motif in stochastically fluctuating environments  @xcite .",
    "however , so far as we know , there is yet no work on the influence of the response time - delay to the fitness of cells living in the fluctuating environment . in this paper",
    ", we construct a stochastic population model with time - delayed switching - rate conversation to quantify the biological influence of the response time - delay on the survival of cells in fluctuating environments .",
    "to study the fitness of cell population , we present a stochastic population model  @xcite , in which environment parameters fluctuate between two different states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and accordingly in which cells display two different phenotypes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "cells of phenotype @xmath2 are fit for growth in the environment @xmath0 with fast growth rate @xmath4 , while those of @xmath3 is unfit for growth in @xmath0 with slow @xmath5 .",
    "situation reverses in the environment @xmath6 as shown in figure 1(a ) .",
    "the environment compensation for the growth of the fit cells is @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , in these two environment states , cells stochastically switch between the two distinct phenotypes with switching rate @xmath8 into fit phenotype and @xmath9 into unfit one .",
    "some authors generally treated the switching - rate conversion simultaneous with the environment change  @xcite . but here in order to consider the influence of response time - delay , we set the switching rates conversion with a delayed time @xmath10 after an state change ; see figure 1(a ) .",
    "the delayed time @xmath10 is a consequence of the gene networks structure when responding to environment changes . in this model ,",
    "the dynamics of the cell numbers in the fit ( @xmath11 ) and unfit ( @xmath12 ) states can be described as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time cells dwell in an environment state before change to the other state .",
    "we assume @xmath15 , which means that dynamic transition condition holds during the switching - rates conversion .",
    "when @xmath16 , switching rates do not convert in this environment state which in fact becomes the static transition .",
    "however , static transition can also be a possible choice for cells , and below we consider above situation together .    to investigate the fitness of cells , we consider the time - averaged population growth - rate @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fraction of cells in the unfit and fit phenotypes in the two environment states respectively .",
    "we assume in this model that the fractions of the cells in fit and unfit phenotypes convert when the cells respond to environment changes , that s , if the fraction of the cells in the fit phenotype is @xmath19 just before the environment turnover , it will be @xmath20 after .",
    "hereafter we focus on the time evolution of the @xmath19 and its time - average ( @xmath21 ) which accounts for the fitness of the cell population . by applying equation  [ number ] ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath19 can be described by the following equations : @xmath22 in different fluctuating environment conditions , @xmath14 and @xmath10 can be tuned .",
    "we solve equations  [ fraction ] , then average @xmath23 with time to evaluate the influence of response time delay on the survival fitness of cells .",
    "vs time in the periodic and stochastic environments , respectively",
    ". corresponding fraction of the fit cells ( @xmath19 ) is plotted , while parameters are set as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "( c ) growth in a symmetrically periodic environment .",
    "the fraction of the fit cells ( @xmath19 ) is plotted with time for a period . in the figure",
    "we show the results of three specific @xmath10 , 0 , 0.5 and 1 .",
    "the parameters in the upper and lower plots are set as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . ]",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] ( b ) shows two examples of @xmath28 changing with time in periodic and stochastic environments . in the periodic environment state",
    ", cells spends a specific time @xmath14 in each states , while in the stochastic case , the time spent in each states has a mean value @xmath14 . without losing generality , we set @xmath29 . from the figure",
    "we can see that after considering the time delay , in the periodic environment there will be an extra turning point at time @xmath10 after each environment change , while in the stochastic environment , only the environment states with duration time longer than @xmath10 show a state turning point .",
    "those brief environment states with duration time shorter than @xmath10 are filtered as a result of phenotype switching system of cells .",
    "the additional turning points of the @xmath28 in different environments and filter out of the short duration environment states in the stochastic environment may introduce intriguing behavior in population fitness of cells with response time - delay , as we show below .    to investigate the influence of response time - delay",
    ", we first consider a simple symmetrically periodic environment with a specific time - delay  @xcite . for different @xmath10",
    ", @xmath28 reaches its periodic state as shown in figure 1(c ) .",
    "two cases are shown there with inter - conversed switching - rates . for @xmath30",
    ", the model returns to what is studied by thattai _ et .",
    "al _ , and so does when @xmath31 , in which @xmath9 denotes the rate switching to the fit state and @xmath8 to the unfit one .",
    "therefore , from figure  [ figure1 ] ( c ) , we can see that the pattern of @xmath32 in the upper graph when @xmath30 is the same as the lower one for @xmath31 , and so does when @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath33 reflects the fitness , we then calculate its averaged value .",
    "for these two delayed time discussed above , one can easily notice that the case with larger switching rate to the fit phenotype generally have higher @xmath34 ; see figure 2(a ) .",
    "when @xmath35 , the tuning point in @xmath28 ( figure  [ figure1 ] ( b ) , ( c ) ) makes @xmath34 behaviors quite different from those without time delays .",
    "after some mathematical analysis and with the help of numerical solution , we find that @xmath21 both decrease where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , indicating a maximum at an intermediate @xmath10 when @xmath38 . while @xmath39 , fitness increases both as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , indicating a minimum at an intermediate @xmath10 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "besides , there is another case when @xmath40 , when switching rates have no enough time to response to the environment change in neither environment states , which is just the case of static transition . in this case , the switching rate to the fit phenotype is half @xmath41 and half @xmath9 in a whole period , and the average effect should be some combination of the @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "so the value of @xmath21 is between the two cases of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( figure 2(a ) ) .",
    "is plotted with @xmath10 .",
    "the solid and dash lines denote the case when @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , as @xmath44 .",
    "two cases of specific time - delays are also shown in the figure .",
    "( b ) parameter influence on the time - averaged @xmath19 . here",
    "we set @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 from 0 to 1.5 .",
    "insert shows @xmath48 from 1.5 to 5 . ]",
    "the results shown above correspond to certain sets of parameters . in all there are three parameters that can be tuned in this model .",
    "@xmath49 represents the growth compensation in different environment .",
    "large @xmath49 indicates much faster cells growth in fit environment than in unfit one , thus it has significant effects on @xmath21 , but limited effects on the trend of @xmath21 to the time - delay @xmath10 .",
    "larger @xmath49 induces higher @xmath21 , but make smaller the difference of @xmath21 induced by different @xmath10 .",
    "however , an extremum at certain @xmath10 always exist(data not shown ) .",
    "the other two tunable parameters are @xmath50 and @xmath8 .",
    "they show similar effects in our model(equation 1 ) . here",
    "we first keep @xmath9 fixed and vary @xmath8 to see its influence on the @xmath21 .",
    "as shown in figure 2(b ) , when @xmath51 , exchange of switching rates become trivial in the model , thus delay times have no influence on @xmath52 and @xmath21 remains constant at different @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath53 , there is a maximum @xmath21 at a certain @xmath10 , even in the homogenetic case when ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "in addition , in the delayed time ( 0@xmath55 with @xmath9 ) , larger @xmath56 indicates a faster transition into the fit phenotype , thus results in a steeper slope of the @xmath21 while reaching its maximum , which means more significant influence of response time - delay on increasing the fitness in case of larger @xmath57 ( figure 2(b ) ) .",
    "a contrary effect is observed for @xmath58 , which always shows a minimum(figure 2(b ) insert ) .",
    "the slope of the decreasing @xmath52 is steeper with larger @xmath59 , which means the response time - delays also show more significant negative influence on the fitness with larger @xmath60 ( figure 2(b ) insert ) .",
    "these results verify that the influence of the response time delay on the fitness of cells is universal and does not strictly depend on state parameters .",
    "these results show some interesting behavior of the response time delay on the fitness of cells .",
    "first , if @xmath58 which means a larger transition rate into fit phenotype in each environment , the best strategy to enhance fitness is to reduce the response time delay , as indicated in figure  [ figure2 ] ( b ) and larger @xmath59 introduces a more severe defect in fitness .",
    "second , above results tells us that cells do not always need to adopt @xmath58 to achieve a higher fitness .",
    "if cells use some special strategy to reverse the value of the two switching rates to set @xmath38 , the response time delay can always approve cells fitness .",
    "besides , there is a specific delay time @xmath61 after which @xmath21 is larger than what cells can reach without time delay in the similar set of parameters ; see figure 2(a ) . in the region @xmath62 , the response time delays prove to be an effective way for cells of optimizing their fitness .",
    "in addition , considering the constant presence of an intrinsic response time - delay in gene networks , there are two switching rates cells can choose . for example , when the delay time is longer than @xmath63 , a strategy which sets @xmath9 to be the larger one gets a better fitness ( figure 2(a ) ) .",
    "the parameter - dependence of @xmath61 and @xmath63 are shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "the value of @xmath61 is always smaller than 1 , which confirms the independence of parameters of these effects , relatively .",
    "figure 3(a ) also shows a large parameter space to be realized to optimize fitness by response time - delay .",
    "third , the static transition strategy ( @xmath40 ) can be a choice for cells in some special cases .",
    "for example , when the systemic time delay is large than a certain value with @xmath58 or shorter with @xmath53 ( figure 2(a ) ) , static transition is better than dynamic one in enhancing survival fitness , while in other conditions with the same switching rates , dynamic transition strategy is still an better option .",
    "finally , following the finding that @xmath28 for @xmath30 and 1 are the same while exchanging @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we find that after a similar manipulation of @xmath10 with @xmath64 and @xmath8 with @xmath50 in equation 1 , this new equation becomes one describing a system with a pre - response time @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath34 dependence on the pre - response time @xmath10 in the new equation for @xmath58 is in fact the same as those with time - delay @xmath10 in the former equation with @xmath53 , which means that an advance - response may induce a better fitness for the population when the cells adopt a faster switching rate to the fit phenotype  @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath63 , respectively . on the left is their dependence on @xmath65 , with @xmath66 ( solid line ) , @xmath67 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath68 ( dotted line ) . on the right",
    "shows their dependence on @xmath8 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 1 ( solid line ) , 10 ( dashed line ) , and 30 ( dotted line ) , respectively .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) cell growth in the fluctuating environment .",
    "time - averaged @xmath19 is plotted with @xmath10 , with @xmath71 in ( b ) and @xmath72 in ( c ) .",
    "the black and grey lines denote the case when @xmath42 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "]    then we consider a simple stochastic environment whose duration - time distribution is described by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 obeys an exponential distribution with mean value @xmath76 .",
    "so the mean value of @xmath14 is 1 and its variance @xmath76 .",
    "when @xmath71 , @xmath14 itself obeys an exponential distribution , and when @xmath77 , it returns to a deterministic periodic environment state .",
    "a general form of @xmath28 is shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "our results show , when @xmath71 and @xmath38 , time delays increase the fitness without reaching a maximum ( figure 3(b ) ) .",
    "similarly , after converting the two switching rates to set @xmath78 , @xmath21 monotonically decreases asymptotically to a value with increasing time - delay .",
    "however , in contrast to the former results , @xmath21 for @xmath78 is always larger than that while @xmath38 .",
    "this phenomenon shows that in this stochastic environment the response time - delay is always a defect for the fitness , and tuning @xmath79 is simply a better strategy  @xcite .",
    "when in cases of larger @xmath80 , results gradually return to the former ones .",
    "results in case of @xmath72 are shown in figure 3(c ) , which shows almost all the characteristics we discuss above .",
    "these results show that the variance may have significant influence on the cells fitness just as the averaged value of the fluctuating environment description .",
    "large variance implies an existence of very short- or very long - duration environment states .",
    "short ones are filtered by the cells phenotype switching system as we discussed above , and this effect is similar with the static transition . for the long ones ,",
    "there are enough time for cells to alter their phenotype with the prescribed switching rates according to the environment change .",
    "therefore , these two effects erase maximum or minimum @xmath52 induced by time delay , and @xmath34 monotonously converge to the static value with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "similar results hold in non - symmetric periodic environment description .",
    "if the ratio of the duration time of the two distinct environment states becomes larger , @xmath21 of the @xmath78 also become larger and those of reversed parameters become smaller accordingly .",
    "finally they separate and do nt intersect just as what happens in the @xmath71 stochastic environment ( data not shown ) .    in this work ,",
    "we use a simple stochastic population model with time - delayed switching - rates conversion to study the influence of the response time - delay on the fitness of cell population .",
    "we find that in some cases such as @xmath38 , time delays can optimize the population fitness , while in some other cases , delay time do nt prove to be so positive .",
    "we also find that in the stochastically fluctuating environment states , variance may be another important factor determining whether time delay can be an advantage for the population fitness or not .",
    "however , since we only considered the exponential distribution of duration time above , other type of stochastic environment should also be considered so as to give a better understanding of population fitness in such environment  @xcite .",
    "besides , this model only uses the average growth - rate to account for population fitness while neglecting other factors such as energy consumption , thus other environment state factors can be included to give a more comprehensive understanding of the issue , and experimental verification of mentioned results is also needed .",
    "we have simulated the effect of distinct response delay - time for two environment states , while little influence on the trend of the @xmath21 dependence on @xmath10 is showed , except the case when the larger @xmath10 dorminates when the system becomes of a static transition .",
    "so here we only consider a specific reponse delay time ."
