    "the state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at redshift @xmath17 remains under considerable debate .",
    "significant transmitted flux in the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath18 means that the igm must have been highly ionized by at least @xmath19  gyr after the big bang @xcite .",
    "each of the four known qsos at @xmath20 show gunn - peterson troughs @xcite over at least a narrow redshift interval @xcite . this complete lack of transmitted flux has been interpreted as an indication that the tail end of cosmic reionization may extend to @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xcite found the evolution of transmitted flux over @xmath22 to be consistent with a smoothly decreasing ionization rate and not indicative of a sudden jump in the ly@xmath3  optical depth at @xmath23 .",
    "significant variations in the fraction of transmitted flux are common among sightlines at the same redshift @xcite . while the spectrum of sdss  j1030 + 0524 ( @xmath6 ) shows complete absorption in ly@xmath3  and ly@xmath5  over a redshift interval @xmath24 @xcite , transmitted flux appears over the same redshifts in the ly@xmath3 , ly@xmath5 , and ly@xmath25  forests of sdss  j1148 + 5251 ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "either the igm is highly ionized everywhere at @xmath26 and long stretches of complete absorption are the result of line blending , or the neutral fraction of the igm is patchy on large scales .",
    "a patchy igm could result from the clumpiness of the igm and the clustering of ionizing sources @xcite .",
    "studies of h  i  transmitted flux are ultimately hampered by the large optical depths expected for even a small neutral fraction .",
    "the presence of a gunn - peterson trough can at best constrain the volume- and mass - weighted h  i  neutral fractions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively @xcite .",
    "alternative measurements are required to probe larger neutral fractions .",
    "the non - evolution in the luminosity function of ly@xmath3-emitting galaxies provides an independent indication that the igm at @xmath29 is highly ionized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although ly@xmath3photons may escape as a result of galactic winds @xcite or from locally ionized bubbles created by clustered sources @xcite . in the future , observations of redshifted 21  cm emission / absorption should trace the growth and evolution of ionized regions at @xmath30 , placing strong constraints on reionization scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a high neutral fraction must also have a measurable effect on metal absorption lines @xcite .",
    "overdense regions of the igm should be the first to become enriched , due to the presence of star - forming sources , yet the last to remain ionized , due to the short recombination times @xcite .",
    "low - ionization metal species should therefore produce numerous absorption features in the spectra of background objects prior to reionization .",
    "a particularly good candidate is o  i , which has an ionization potential nearly identical to that of h  i  and a transition at 1302    that can be observed redward of the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "oxygen and hydrogen will lock in charge - exchange equilibrium @xcite , which ensures that their neutral fractions will remain nearly equal , @xmath31 despite the increased photo - ionization cross section of o  i  at higher energies , this relationship is expected to hold over a wide range in @xmath32 ( oh et al .",
    "2005 , in prep ) .    in this work ,",
    "we present a search for o  i  in the spectra of nine @xmath33 qsos .",
    "this is the first time a set of @xmath34 spectra has been taken at high resolution ( r = 45,000 ) .",
    "our sample includes three objects at @xmath13 , where we might expect to see an `` o  i  forest '' @xcite . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "the results of the o  i  search are detailed in  3 . in ",
    "4 we demonstrate a significant overabundance of o  i  systems towards the highest - redshift object , sdss  j1148 + 5251 ( @xmath4 ) , and compare the overabundance to the number density of lower - redshift o  i  systems and other absorbers with high h  i  column densities . measurements of the relative metal abundances for all the detected systems are described in  5 . in  6",
    "we discuss the significance of these excess systems for the enrichment and ionization state of the igm at @xmath23 .",
    "our results are summarized in  7 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  km  s@xmath39  mpc@xmath39 .",
    "observations using the keck hires spectrograph @xcite were made between 2003 february and 2005 june , with the bulk of the data acquired during 2005 january and february .",
    "our qso sample and the observations are summarized in table  1 . all except the 2003 february data were taken with the upgraded hires detector .",
    "we used an 086 slit , which gives a velocity resolution fwhm of @xmath40  km  s@xmath39 .",
    "the continuum luminosities in our sample approach the practical detection limit of hires .",
    "in addition , the spectral regions of interest for this work lie in the far red , where skyline contamination and atmospheric absorption are major concerns . to address these difficulties ,",
    "the data were reduced using a custom set of idl routines written by one of us ( gdb ) .",
    "this package uses optimal sky subtraction @xcite to achieve poisson - limited residuals in the two - dimensional sky - subtracted frame .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using optimal extraction @xcite .",
    "blueward of the ly@xmath3  emission line , the continuum for these objects is highly obscured due to strong absorption from the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "furthermore , single exposures were typically too faint to fit reliable continua even in unabsorbed regions .",
    "individual orders were therefore combined by first flux calibrating each order using the response function derived from a standard star .",
    "the combined spectra were continuum - fit by hand using a cubic spline .",
    "standards stars were also to correct for telluric absorption . estimated residuals from continuum fitting ( redward of ly@xmath3 ) and atmospheric correction are typically within the flux uncertainties .",
    "at @xmath41 it becomes increasingly difficult to identify individual ly@xmath3  lines due to the large opacity in the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "therefore , candidate o  i  lines must be confirmed using other ions at the same redshift .",
    "si  ii  @xmath42 and c  ii  @xmath43 are the most useful for this purpose since their rest wavelengths place them redward of the ly@xmath3  forest , at least over a limited range in redshift .",
    "these transitions are also expected to be relatively strong over a range in ionization conditions . at lower redshifts where",
    "si  ii  @xmath42 has entered the forest , we are still sensitive to si  ii  @xmath44 , although it is weaker than si  ii  @xmath42 by a factor of 7 .",
    "we searched for o  i  in each sightline over the redshift range between the quasar redshift @xmath45 and the redshift @xmath46 , where o  i  enters the ly@xmath3  forest . to identify a system , we required absorption at the same redshift in o  i  and either si  ii  @xmath42 or c  ii  @xmath47 , and that the line profiles for at least two of the ions be comparable . in practice ,",
    "si  ii  @xmath42 proved to be the best indicator over the lower - redshift end of each sightline , since the signal - to - noise ( @xmath48 ) ratio was typically better over that region of the spectrum . at redshifts where si  ii  @xmath42 was lost in the forest we relied solely upon c  ii  for confirmation . by chance , the two o  i  systems we identified using only c  ii  were also strong enough to be detected in si  ii  @xmath44 .",
    "we identified six o  i  systems in total along our nine lines of sight .",
    "their properties are summarized in table  2 .",
    "four of the six systems appear towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 , and we examine this potential overabundance in detail in  4 .",
    "voigt profiles were fitted using the vpfit package written , by r. carswell .",
    "due to line blending and the modest @xmath48 ratio over some regions of the data , it was often necessary to tie the redshift and/or doppler parameter of one ion to those of another whose profile was more clearly defined in order to obtain a satisfactory fit . in practice ,",
    "the resulting total column densities are very similar to those obtained when all parameters are allowed to vary freely , as would be expected for systems still on the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "comments on individual systems are given below .",
    "this system shows a central complex in o  i , si  ii , and c  ii  that is best fit using three components with a total velocity span of @xmath51  km  s@xmath39 .",
    "we measure the redshifts and @xmath52-parameters of the bluest two central components from si  ii .",
    "the redshift and @xmath52-parameter for the reddest central component are measured from o  i , which is least affected by additional lines towards the red .",
    "leaving all parameters untied produces a two - component fit for c  ii , which is likely due to low @xmath48 .",
    "however , the total column densities remain virtually unchanged .    a single component at @xmath53  km  s@xmath39  appears in si  iiand c  ii  but not in o  i. since o",
    "i  is more easily ionized than either si  ii  or c  ii  ( @xmath54  ev , @xmath55  ev , @xmath56  ev ) this component probably arises from gas that is more highly ionized than the gas producing the o  i  absorption .",
    "three additional components appear redward of the central o  i  complex .",
    "these are visible in si  ii , c  ii , and si  iv and presumably correspond to gas in a still higher ionization state .",
    "we use si  ii  to constrain the redshift and @xmath52-parameters for all the non - o  i  components , although fitting without tying any parameters produces very similar results .",
    "this system shows multiple components with a total velocity span of @xmath58  km  s@xmath39 .",
    "the si  ii  is strong enough that the 1304    transition is clearly visible .",
    "some additional absorption occurs along the blue edge of the o  i  complex .",
    "however , since no corresponding absorption appears in c  ii  this features is unlikely to be genuine o  i. we use c  ii  to fix the redshifts and @xmath52-parameters of the bluest two components and the reddest component for all ions .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath52 values for the remaining components are tied to o  i. the weakest c  ii  component was automatically dropped by the fitting program .",
    "however , this should not have a significant impact on the summed c  ii  column density .",
    "no si  iv  was detected down to @xmath60 .",
    "a strong line appears at a velocity separation @xmath61  km  s@xmath39  from the o  i  complex .",
    "weak absorption appears at the same velocity in si  ii  @xmath44 .",
    "however , the corresponding c  ii  region is completely covered by mg  i  @xmath62 from a strong mg  ii  system at @xmath63 . therefore , while these features are plausibly associated with the o  i  complex , their identity can not presently be confirmed .",
    "we do not include these lines when computing the relative abundances , although their o  i / si  ii  ratio is consistent with those measured for the other o  i  systems .",
    "this system shows multiple components with a velocity span of @xmath65  km  s@xmath39 .",
    "the si  ii  @xmath42 transition falls in the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "however , si  ii  @xmath44 is clearly visible .",
    "the c  ii  occurs among moderate - strength telluric absorption . in correcting for the atmosphere we recovered a c  ii  velocity profile very similar to that of o  i  and si  ii .",
    "some additional absorption around the c  ii  are probably telluric lines that were not completely removed .",
    "we achieved the best fit for o  i  using four components while allowing the continuum level to vary slightly . using fewer components resulted in virtually the same total @xmath66 , which is to be expected if the lines lie along the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "we used the @xmath59 and @xmath52 values for these four o  i  lines to determine the corresponding column densities for si  ii  and c  ii . leaving all parameters untied resulted in small changes in the @xmath52-parameters and in the preferred number of lines used by vpfit ( 3 for si  ii  instead of 4 ) , but negligible changes in the total column density for each ion .",
    "we detect no si  iv  down to @xmath67 .",
    "this system does show c  iv  absorption in the low - resolution nirspec spectrum taken by @xcite .",
    "however , the kinematic structure can not be determined from their data , and it is therefore unknown whether the c  iv  absorption arises from the same gas that produces the lower - ionization lines .",
    "the si  ii  @xmath42 line for this system falls in the ly@xmath3forest . however , si  ii  @xmath44 is strong enough to be visible .",
    "we tie the redshifts and @xmath52-parameters for si  ii  and c  ii  at @xmath69 to those for o  i , which has the cleanest profile . leaving all parameters untied produces changes in the @xmath52-parameters that are within the errors and negligible changes in the column densities .",
    "possible additional c  ii  lines appear at @xmath70 , -29 , and 26 km  s@xmath39  from the strong component .",
    "these do not appear in o  i  and would probably be too weak to appear in si  ii  @xmath44 .",
    "we do not include them when computing the relative abundances for this system .",
    "no si  iv  was detected down to @xmath71 .",
    "the si  ii  @xmath42 and c  ii  lines for this system occur in transparent gaps within regions of mild telluric absorption . in some of our exposures ,",
    "the o  i  line falls on the blue wing of a strong telluric feature .",
    "however , the o  i  can be clearly seen in the uncorrected 2005 january data , where the heliocentric velocity shifted the observed qso spectrum further to the blue .",
    "we tie the redshifts and @xmath52-values for o  i  and c  ii  to those of si  ii , for which the line profile is the cleanest . leaving all parameters",
    "untied produces negligible changes in the column densities .",
    "we use a single component for the primary fit to this system .",
    "the c  ii  falls on a sky emission line and hence the line profile is rather noisy .",
    "we therefore tied the redshift and @xmath52-parameter for c  ii  to those of si  ii , while @xmath59 and @xmath52 for o  i  were allowed to vary freely .",
    "the fitted @xmath59 and @xmath52 values for o  i  agree with those for si  ii  within the fit errors . tying @xmath59 and @xmath52 for o  i  to those of si  ii  produced no significant change in @xmath66 .",
    "both si  ii  @xmath42 and o  i  are well fit by a single line , while the blue edge of the c  ii  shows a possible additional component .",
    "we fit this component separately but do include it when computing relative abundances .",
    "despite the relatively small total number of detected o  i  systems , a noticable overabundance appears towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 .",
    "it should be noted that this object has one of the brightest continuum magnitudes among qsos at @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we also spent considerable integration time on this object .",
    "therefore , the data are among the best in our sample . in this section",
    "we address the null hypothesis that the apparent imbalance in the distribution of o  i  systems results from a combination of incompleteness and small number statistics .    for each sightline we used an automated scheme to determine the absorption pathlength interval @xmath74 over which we are sensitive to systems above a given o  i  column density . for a non - evolving population of sources expanding with the hubble flow , we expect to intersect the same number of sources per unit @xmath75 at all redshifts , where @xmath75 is defined for @xmath35 as @xmath76 at the redshift of each pixel where we are potentially sensitive to o  i , we inserted artificial single - component systems containing o  i , si  ii , and c  ii  with relative abundances set to the mean measured values ( see  5 ) and a turbulent doppler width of @xmath77  km  s@xmath39",
    ". the minimum @xmath66 at which the system could be detected by the automated program was then determined .",
    "a detection required that there be significant ( @xmath78 ) absorption at the expected wavelengths of o  i  and at least one of the other two ions .",
    "the redshifts of at least two of the three fitted profiles must also agree within a tolerance of @xmath79 , and the line widths must agree to within a factor of two . in the case where the fitted profiles agree for only two of the ions , the spectrum at the wavelength of the third ion must be consistent with the expected level of absorption .",
    "this allows for one of the ions to be blended with another line or lost in ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "lines that fell in the fraunhofer a band were not considered .",
    "this method detected all of the known o  i  systems and produced only one false detection in the real data , which was easily dismissed by visual inspection .",
    "we note that this method focuses on our ability to detect systems similar to those observed towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 .",
    "multiple - component systems such as the two at lower redshift are in general easy to identify , even in noisy regions of the spectrum .    the results of the sensitivity measurements are shown in figure  9 .",
    "the solid lines show the @xmath74 over which we are sensitive to systems with @xmath80 .",
    "the o  i  column densities for the four systems seen towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 are marked with circles .",
    "the dashed line shows the mean @xmath74 as a function of @xmath81 for all nine sightlines .",
    "while it is clear that the path length over which we are sensitive to low - column density systems is considerably smaller for some sightlines than for sdss  j1148 + 5251 , there does exist significant coverage across the total sample even at the @xmath66 of the weakest system in our sample .",
    "completeness effects will depend on the intrinsic distribution of line strengths , in that weaker systems will more easily be lost in low-@xmath48 sightlines .",
    "it is useful to define an effective absorption pathlength interval @xmath82 such that , for a sightline with a total pathlength @xmath83 and sensitivity @xmath84 , we would expect to detect the same number @xmath85 of systems with @xmath86 over @xmath82 if we had perfect sensitivity . for a column - density distribution @xmath87 , this gives @xmath88 where @xmath84 is the fraction of the total pathlength over which we are sensitive to systems with column density @xmath89 .",
    "the sensitivity function can be determined directly from figure  9 .",
    "we assume a conventional power - law distribution in o  i  column densities @xmath90 .",
    "hence , @xmath91 taking into account our measured sensitivity , the maximum likelihood estimator for @xmath3 for all six o  i  systems is @xmath92 .",
    "a k - s test allows @xmath93 at the 95% confidence level .    in figure  10 we plot",
    "@xmath82 as a function of @xmath3 taking @xmath94  @xmath95 as the cutoff value .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath82 for sdss  j1148 + 5251 , while the dashed line shows @xmath82 for the remaining eight sightlines , divided by 5.7 to match sdss  j1148 + 5251 at @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to see that the ratio @xmath97 does not change significantly with @xmath3 ( @xmath98 over @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is purely a coincidence , most likely related to the fact that the overall high quality of the sdss  j1148 + 5251 data is balanced by the placement of the o  i  systems in a difficult region of the spectrum .",
    "however , it means that the relative numbers of expected o  i  detections for sdss  j1148 + 5251 and the remaining eight sightlines should be nearly invariant over a wide range in plausible column density distributions .",
    "we can now evaluate the likelihood that the imbalance of o  idetection results from small number sampling .",
    "for a poisson distribution , the likelihood of detecting @xmath85 systems when the expected number of detections is @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 if we assume that the expected number of detections towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 is @xmath102 , then the probability of detecting at least 4 systems is @xmath103 similarly , if we take the number of systems observed towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 as a representative sample and compute the expected number of systems towards the remaining eight sightlines to be @xmath104 , then the likelihood of detecting at most two systems is @xmath105 the probability of simultaneously detecting at least 4 systems towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 while detecting at most two systems along the remaining eight sightlines , @xmath106 \\ , \\left [    \\sum_{\\mathcal{n } = 0}^{2}{p(\\mathcal{n},{\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{n}}{\\partial x}}\\,\\delta x^{\\rm eff}_{\\rm other } ) }     \\right ] \\ , , \\ ] ] has a maximum of @xmath107 at @xmath108 , taking @xmath109 .",
    "thus , assuming that the o  i  systems are randomly distributed , we can rule out with a high degree of confidence the possibility that the excess number of detected systems towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 is the result of a statistical fluctuation .",
    "our sample of nine @xmath110 sightlines is sufficient to demonstrate that the apparent excess of o  i  systems towards sdss  1148 + 5251 is highly unlikely to arise from a random spatial distribution of absorbers .",
    "however , the distribution may be significantly non - random due to large - scale clustering .",
    "for example , if the line - of - sight towards sdss  1148 + 5251 passes through an overdense region of the igm then we might expect to intersect more than the typical number of absorbers .    to address this possibility , we have searched for o  i  in the spectra of an additional 30 qsos with @xmath111 .",
    "the sample was taken entirely with hires for a variety of studies .",
    "due to the lower qso redshifts , the data are of significantly higher quality than the @xmath110 sample .",
    "all sightlines are complete down to @xmath112 ( apart from rare wavelength coverage gaps ) with the majority complete down to @xmath113 .    a detailed study of the properties of lower - redshift o  i  absorbers will be presented elsewhere .",
    "here we note that 11 systems with @xmath1 were identified along all 30 sightlines in the redshift intervals where o  i  would occur redward of the ly@xmath3  forest .",
    "this is comparable to but slightly larger than the incidence rate among the eight lowest - redshift sightlines in our @xmath110 sample .",
    "the number density is even somewhat higher among the @xmath114 sample since the absorption pathlength intervals are shorter ( cf .",
    "[ eq : dx ] ) .",
    "however , many of the @xmath114 spectra were taken in order to study known damped ly@xmath3  systems ( dlas ; @xmath115 ) , which commonly exhibit o  i  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we would therefore expect these sightlines to contain more than the typical number of o  i  systems .",
    "the important point is that no sightline contained more than a single system .",
    "if the excess towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 is due to the chance alignment with an overdense region of the igm , then such a coincidence must occur in fewer than @xmath116 of all sightlines .",
    "we can compare the observed number of o  i  systems in our @xmath117 sample with the expected number of dlas by extrapolating from lower - redshift dla surveys .",
    "@xcite find a line number density @xmath118 .",
    "this is consistent at high-@xmath59 with the larger survey done by @xcite and with the number density evolution @xcite obtained by combining dla samples over @xmath119 . from this @xmath120",
    "we would expect a total of @xmath121 dlas total along all nine lines - of - sight in the redshift intervals where are sensitive to o  i. this is consistent with the two o  i  systems seen along the eight lower - redshift sightlines .",
    "however , we would expect to see only @xmath122 dlas towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 , which is inconsistent with the four we observe .",
    "the disparity eases for sdss  j1148 + 5251 if we include all lyman limit systems ( llss ; @xmath123 ) .",
    "the line number density of llss at @xmath124 found by @xcite , @xmath125 , predicts @xmath126 llss towards sdss  j1148 + 5251 in the interval where we can observe o  i. however , there should also be @xmath127 llss along the remaining eight lines - of - sight . if the excess o  i  absorbers are associated with the progenitors of lower - redshift llss then they must evolve strongly in o  i  at @xmath128 .",
    "absorption systems at @xmath41 provide an opportunity to study metal enrichment when the age of the universe was @xmath129  gyr .",
    "the opacity of the ly@xmath3  forest at these redshifts prevents us from measuring reliable h  i  column densities .",
    "however , we are still able to constrain relative abundances . in table  3",
    "we summarize the voigt profile fitting results .",
    "total column densities for each system include only components with confirmed o  i. relative abundances were calculated using the solar values of @xcite and assuming zero ionization corrections .",

    "the ionization potential of o  i  is smaller than that of si  ii  ( @xmath140  ev , @xmath141  ev ) .",
    "therefore , applying an ionization correction would increase o / si . taking @xmath130",

    "the mean c / si ratio is consistent with zero silicon contribution from vmss , although c / si may decrease if ionization corrections are applied ( @xmath56  ev @xmath143 ) .",
    "dust corrections would also decrease c / si since silicon is more readily depleted onto grains @xcite .",
    "our upper limit of @xmath144 \\rangle < -0.27~(2\\sigma)$ ] therefore does not provide an additional constraint on @xmath135 .",
