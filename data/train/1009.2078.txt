    "the discovery of quantum oscillations in cuprates , first detected in the resistance of yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ybco ) at a hole concentration ( doping ) @xmath13 , @xcite revealed the presence of a small closed pocket in the fermi surface of these materials at low temperature , deep in the underdoped region of the phase diagram . observed in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity , the oscillations were soon also detected in the magnetization,@xcite in all cases giving the same dominant frequency , corresponding to 2  % of the brillouin zone area .",

    "this includes the stripe scenario@xcite discussed in section v.a .",
    "a different interpretation of the quantum oscillations measured in ybco has recently been proposed in terms of a three - pocket scenario which neglects bi - layer splitting and attributes the two closeby frequencies near @xmath98  t to a small electron pocket at @xmath125 and a small hole pocket at @xmath126 , plus an additional closed large hole pocket.@xcite it is difficult to see how this scenario can be reconciled with the large negative hall and seebeck coefficients measured in ybco at the same doping . given their similar carrier densities and mobilities,@xcite the two small pockets would necessarily make comparable contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath112 , but of opposite sign , thereby cancelling out , leaving the resulting coefficients to be dominated by the larger hole pocket , giving positive values , contrary to observation .",
    "for the electron pocket to dominate the hall and seebeck signals , its mobility at @xmath8 must be much higher than that of the remaining sheets of the fermi surface .",

    "so the full process of reconstructing the fermi surface , as it unfolds with decreasing temperature , may start at @xmath255 with a @xmath123-dependent change in the scattering before it gives birth to an electron pocket below @xmath52 , produced by a folding of the brillouin zone due to the broken translational symmetry .",
    "a similar two - stage process is observed in nd - lsco and eu - lsco , whereby @xmath256,@xcite where @xmath257 is the onset temperature for stripe order as detected by either x - ray diffraction or nuclear quadrupolar resonance , which coincides with the anomalies in the hall and seebeck coefficients .@xcite this suggests that the pseudogap phase below @xmath156 is a high - temperature precursor of the stripe order that sets in at a lower temperature .",
    "measurements of the nernst effect in ybco support this interpretation in the sense that the nernst coefficient @xmath251 acquires a strong in - plane anisotropy upon entry into the pseudogap phase , starting at @xmath258 and rising with decreasing temperature , reaching values as high as @xmath259 at @xmath119.@xcite an interpretation of the pseudogap phase in hole - doped cuprates as a precursor region of stripe ( or sdw ) fluctuations is analogous to the interpetation of the pseudogap phase in electron - doped cuprates,@xcite where @xmath156 is found to be the temperature below which the antiferromagnetic correlation length exceeds the thermal de broglie wavelength of the charge carriers.@xcite     ( black diamonds ) as a function of doping ( from ref .  ) and the resistive upper critical field @xmath260 at @xmath37  k ( white diamonds ) , marking the end of the superconducting transition as a function of field ( see figs .  1 , 5 and 6 ) .",

    "all lines are a guide to the eye.,width=302 ]      it is interesting to consider whether the evolution of the fermi surface has any impact on the superconductivity .",
    "a first observation is that @xmath262 , which we may regard as the onset of fermi - surface reconstruction , crosses the @xmath263 line where @xmath28 is maximal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tstar ] ) .",
    "in other words , in the overdoped region , @xmath28 rises with underdoping up until the fermi surface of the normal state , out of which superconductivity emerges , reconstructs .",
    "superconductivity appears to be weakened by this reconstruction .",
    "it is well known that in hole - doped cuprates there is an anomalous weakening of superconductivity near @xmath236 , whereby @xmath28 drops below the idealized parabolic dependence on doping .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltatc ] for ybco .",
    "the difference between the measured @xmath28 and the idealized @xmath28 , @xmath264 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltatc ] ( from ref .  ) .",
    "we see that @xmath261 , the amount by which @xmath28 is suppressed , is largest at @xmath236 ( @xmath76  k ) .",
    "this @xmath28 dip at @xmath236 , also seen in lsco , lbco , and nd - lsco is attributed to the competing effect of stripe order , made more stable by a commensurate locking with the lattice when @xmath265 .",
    "this is compelling evidence that stripe order , or at least stripe correlations , are present in ybco .",
    "similarly , the fact that @xmath50 - a marker of fermi - surface reconstruction - peaks at @xmath236 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltatc ] ) also suggests that fermi - surface reconstruction is caused by stripe order .",
    "it is intriguing that @xmath261 is directly proportional to @xmath50 ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "13 ) . below @xmath49 , @xmath261 and @xmath50",
    "scale perfectly , both vanishing as @xmath266 .",
    "it appears as though @xmath28 is suppressed by a more prominent electron pocket .",
    "while the zero - field @xmath28 vs @xmath4 curve shows a small depression at @xmath236 , producing the well - known 60-k plateau , the resistive upper critical field @xmath267 shows a pronounced minimum at @xmath268 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rhvsb ] , we see that @xmath269  t at @xmath40 , larger than it is at @xmath119 , where @xmath270  t. this is surprising since @xmath28 is considerably lower at @xmath40 ( 45  k ) than at @xmath119 ( 66  k ) . above @xmath268 ,",
    "@xmath267 rises again , with @xmath269  t at @xmath271 and @xmath272  t at @xmath273 ( see fig .",
    "this again points to stripe order .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the onset of superconductivity is directly affected by changes in the fermi surface or whether both changes are instead driven by an underlying competition between stripe order , say , and @xmath196-wave superconducting order , with the former being possibly stabilized at @xmath57 by a commensurate locking of the spin / charge modulation with the lattice .",
    "measurements of the hall coefficient @xmath0 in ybco performed in magnetic fields large enough to suppress superconductivity reveal that the normal - state @xmath0 is negative at @xmath8 in a range of doping from @xmath59 to at least @xmath63 , in the underdoped region of the phase diagram .",
    "the negative @xmath0 is attributed to the presence of a high - mobility electron pocket in the fermi surface of underdoped ybco at low temperature , located at the ( @xmath274 ) point in the brillouin zone and responsible for the quantum oscillations observed in the in - plane transport,@xcite the magnetization@xcite and the @xmath33-axis resistivity.@xcite    we attribute the sudden change in @xmath0 at @xmath8 from negative to positive as the doping is reduced below @xmath9 to a change in fermi - surface topology , or lifshitz transition , whereby the electron pocket disappears below a critical doping @xmath10 .",
    "the loss of the high - mobility electron pocket explains a number of previous observations , including : 1 ) the sudden increase in resistivity across @xmath11,@xcite referred to as a ` metal - insulator ' transition ; 2 ) the qualitative change in the @xmath33-axis resistivity across @xmath11;@xcite 3 ) the sudden increase in the in - plane anisotropy @xmath165 across @xmath11.@xcite    the natural explanation for an electron pocket at @xmath121 is a fermi - surface reconstruction caused by an ordered state that breaks translational symmetry . from the empirical fact",
    "that similar signatures of an electron pocket are observed in the hall and seebeck coefficients of a number of hole - doped cuprates , in particular some where stripe order is clearly the cause of the fermi - surface reconstruction,@xcite we infer that a similar type of stripe order , or undirectional spin - density - wave order , is also at play in ybco .",
    "a model of fermi - surface reconstruction by stripe order@xcite can account not only for the presence of an electron pocket at @xmath121 but also for its loss across a lifshitz transition,@xcite a natural consequence of increasing either the stripe potential or the stripe period .",
