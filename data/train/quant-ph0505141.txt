    "two arbitrary states of an elementary system can be transformed into each other by symmetry operations .",
    "this opens the door to express what can be observed of the system , i.e. the system properties , in terms of the generators of these symmetries . in the case of the poincare group",
    "they are the momenta @xmath0 and the angular momenta and boosts @xmath1 .",
    "for the system to be elementary they are constrained by the mass shell condition @xmath2 and by the spin condition @xmath3 .",
    "( the pauli - lubanski vector is defined as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 in this paper unless otherwise specified ) .",
    "notice now the conjunction of both , the four vector character of the momenta on one side , with the necessity of introducing conjugate operators to the three - momentum to formulate dynamics on the other .",
    "this calls for the introduction of a four vector operator @xmath6 conjugate to @xmath0 such that @xmath7 = i   g^{\\mu \\nu } \\label{a}\\ ] ]    regretfully , this is not possible to attain .",
    "the reason is that @xmath6 would produce translations in the momentum . if @xmath0 is defined on the mass shell , then @xmath8 and , no matter the value of the four vector parameter @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the transformations generated by @xmath11 pull the momentum @xmath12 out of the particle mass shell .    the problem is independent of the form of dynamics in use .",
    "it has far reaching consequences .",
    "first , it is necessary to abandon a four vector @xmath6 and hence the hope of building a covariant form dynamics in terms of momenta and positions  @xcite .",
    "then , with time and position demoted to the role of mere parameters , it is necessary to introduce quantum fields with creation and annihilation operators playing the role of conjugate pairs . to our accustomed eyes",
    "they look like the appropriate recipe for particle number non conservation  @xcite but , is it so ?",
    "at least two important lessons remain : 1 .",
    "that time is along the direction that would be conjugate to the solution of the mass shell constraint and 2 .",
    "that time runs due to the constraint .    with the usual non covariant choice , where the mass shell condition reads as @xmath13 , the problem turns into a version of the pauli theorem  @xcite",
    ", namely @xmath14 this implies that the spectrum of @xmath15 has to be the real line , something that runs again the existence of the physically necessary ground state .",
    "so , in the time form of dynamics the problem looks like the incompatibility of @xmath16 with the boundedness of the hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath16 is not selfadjoint , then @xmath17 \\neq i$ ] and there are way outs from the problem .",
    "perhaps the simplest case for an observable time is the time of arrival ( toa ) of a particle at a certain position in one space dimension  @xcite .",
    "classically @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the dynamical variables of phase space ( initial position and momentum ) and @xmath20 the arrival position . obtaining the quantum version @xmath21 of this toa",
    "is complicated due to the presence of @xmath22 and to operator ordering .",
    "it is well known that there is no selfadjoint @xmath21 , its most symmetrical expression being @xmath23 the eigenvectors of this operator , @xmath24 can be given in the momentum representation where @xmath22 is easier to deal with , as @xmath25 the degeneration parameter @xmath26 can take the values + 1 for right movers , -1 for left movers.this is the only residue left at one space dimension of the continuous manifold of directions present for higher d.    the bad news come in the form of nonorthogonality of the time eigenstates .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the hamiltonian is bounded from below : @xmath27 with @xmath28 . by using ( [ e ] )",
    "we get    @xmath29    to get orthogonality it is necessary to move @xmath30 to @xmath31 something that resembles the weisskopf - wigner trick for resonances . in any case",
    "it is clear that the problem source is in @xmath32 .",
    "marolf devised a procedure , used in ref  @xcite , to surmount nonorthogonality .",
    "the idea is to replace @xmath33 and @xmath15 by  regularized \" expressions that avoid the difficulties that arise when @xmath34 , namely , to introduce @xmath35 then , @xmath36 an expression tailored for the momentum representation where @xmath37 the  regularized energy \" is given by @xmath38 thus , while @xmath39 when @xmath40 , @xmath41 as @xmath34 .",
    "this solves the problem by removing the lower bound in @xmath42 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath43    the procedure works fine for the case of free particles . with minor obvious modifications ,",
    "it works equally well for relativistic particles and for any number of space dimensions .",
    "however , it is only suitable for those cases where momentum remains constant .",
    "so , its very definition brings this procedure to a dead end .    soon after the publication of ref  @xcite giannitrapani  @xcite observed that the time of arrival was an instance of generalized observable endowed with a probabilistic interpretation as a positive operator valued ( pov ) measure .",
    "in fact , the time of arrival eigenstates form a complete set : @xmath44 not being orthogonal they can not constitute a projector valued measure , but  as pointed out in ref  @xcite  nothing prevents from using them to construct a pov measure .",
    "giannitrapani showed that the probability that the time of arrival at @xmath20 of the state @xmath45 be in the range @xmath46 $ ] is @xmath47\\right)\\,=\\,tr\\left[\\rho\\,\\left(\\sum_s \\int_{t}^{t'}\\ , dt\\ , \\,|t , x , s\\,\\rangle\\,\\langle t , x , s\\,|\\right)\\right]\\label{m}\\ ] ] the mean value and variance of the toa are given in  @xcite , where the problems arising from nonorthogonality when trying to obtain kinematical uncertainty relations between energy and time are discussed .",
    "the paper also analyzes the free particle toa operator of ( [ d ] ) acting on the domain of infinitely differentiable functions over the compact subsets of values of @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the variance of @xmath33 turns out to be computable as for ordinary observables and the heisenberg uncertainty relation holds . to summarize : endowed with the pov measure interpretation ,",
    "the toa became an useful instrument appropriate to extract physical information from one of the primary laboratory events :  when \" a detector clicks .",
    "no wonder this is the customary approach in the current literature .",
    "wigner introduced  @xcite in 1932 a distribution at midway between the position and the momentum representation with the aim of describing particle properties in phase space .",
    "the non positivity of the distribution was an obstruction to its use as a probability distribution .",
    "later on , husimi  @xcite introduced sets of minimal uncertainty states @xmath49 in position and momentum : @xmath50 the distribution is centered at the point @xmath51 . given a system in an arbitrary state @xmath52 ,",
    "the probability that the system occupy a region in phase space centered at @xmath51 of half widths @xmath53 is given by @xmath54    we now return to the time of arrival of a free particle at a specific position in one space dimension .",
    "we learnt the difficulties that arise in this seemingly simple problem .",
    "they can be articulated through the pauli theorem in two complementary ways : the impossibility of finding a conjugate pair of time and energy selfadjoint operators or , the difficulty to connect the two different spectra @xmath55 and @xmath56 . to avoid them",
    ", we will follow a procedure that resembles husimi s .",
    "we start by introducing two functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 defined over the real line @xmath59 and the positive real line @xmath60 respectively .",
    "we take @xmath61 as a positive integer @xmath62 .",
    "also , we assume @xmath63 and @xmath64 to be fourier transforms of each other .",
    "finally , @xmath65    these functions on which t ( respectively @xmath66 ) act multiplicatively , present the following nice property under fourier transformation : @xmath67 we point out that for @xmath68 both derivatives act on these functions as selfadjoint operators ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is also remarkable that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "so , they can be given a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "finally , to the canonical pair @xmath72 acting on @xmath73 ( the would be  time representation \" ) corresponds the unitarily equivalent pair @xmath74 acting on @xmath66 ( the would be  energy representation \" ) .",
    "this looks like a promising starting point for constructing true conjugate representations for time and energy .",
    "the obstruction is the need of completeness of the @xmath63 in @xmath75 and of the @xmath64 in @xmath76 to build systems of generators for square integrable functions .",
    "this is a necessary condition to arrive at a pov measure .",
    "if in addition we find orthogonality , then we would reach a pv measure .",
    "notice however , that these measures would correspond to fuzzy distributions around a central value , in much the same way that the husimi gaussian wave packets do .",
    "this can be seen with our @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which are not eigenstates of time or energy .",
    "@xmath77 the construction of eigenfunctions is hopeless at this stage .",
    "for instance , be @xmath78 a putative eigenfunction , so that @xmath79",
    ". then @xmath80 ; expanding this in the @xmath58 would at least require that they form a complete set , which is not the case .",
    "the power of this simple example is that it signals the way to proceed .",
    "orthogonal polynomials are a useful tool to solve a variety of problems in physics .",
    "the laguerre polynomials @xmath81 constitute a set of orthogonal polynomials on the interval @xmath82 with weight @xmath83 .",
    "accordingly , we can define the set of orthogonal functions @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a short of width of the exponential distribution that also serves to keep dimensions right ( still , @xmath87 ) .",
    "this definition , provides a discrete denumerable set of modes that constitute a basis for all the functions belonging to @xmath88 .",
    "these functions comprise all functions with positive frequencies ( i.e. @xmath89 ) that can also be associated to probabilities ( in fact , @xmath90 ) .",
    "the orthogonality and completeness relations read explicitly as @xmath91    .",
    "@xmath66 is given in units of @xmath86 and @xmath92 in units of @xmath93 .",
    "the number of maxima for each mode is @xmath94 .",
    "the mode widths grow with increasing @xmath95 . ]    the physical information contained in the modes is readily obtained . in this representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian , in spite of its simple form @xmath96 is a non - diagonal matrix with elements given through @xmath97 in the same way @xmath98 the coefficients @xmath99 s are computable by standard methods .",
    "notice that @xmath100 is not @xmath101 .",
    "the average value of the energy in the n - th mode is @xmath102 and the average of the squared hamiltonian @xmath103\\ ,   \\omega_0 ^ 2 \\label{w}\\ ] ] finally , the variance of @xmath15 , @xmath104 in the n - th mode is given by @xmath105\\omega_0 ^ 2\\ , \\label{x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] another question to investigate are the eigenvalues @xmath106 and eigenfunctions @xmath107 of the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath107 can be expanded in terms of the modes as @xmath108 which translates into the set of linear equations @xmath109 left to the interested reader as an exercise .",
    "we take the next step forward and define wave packets centered at the point @xmath110 in time energy space . to simplify the discussion",
    "we assume that @xmath106 is the average energy in the n - th mode @xmath111 .",
    "we assume  for our purposes here  that we can trade @xmath112 by @xmath110 .",
    "finally , the wave packet we are looking for is : @xmath113    the meaning of this time @xmath114 just introduced can best be explored in the time representation .",
    "the fourier transform of the modes @xmath115 bring them from the energy to the time representation that is @xmath116    .",
    "the modes plotted here are for @xmath117 .",
    "notice that here the width in @xmath73 is one order of magnitude smaller than in fig .",
    "1 ]    notice that @xmath118 by construction .",
    "also , as the @xmath119 are a basis in @xmath76 they constitute a basis for @xmath120 .",
    "so , we conclude that they form a system of imprimitivity leading to a pv measure .",
    "this is valid for both , the @xmath66 and the @xmath73 representations as they are unitarily equivalent .",
    "the explicit expression of the modes in the @xmath73 representation is quite cumbersome , but throws some light on their physical content and on the way that the two different spectra are connected . from ref  @xcite",
    "we learn that the integral in ( [ z ] ) can be carried out giving : @xmath121 being the first entry a negative integer @xmath122 , the hypergeometric function terminates .",
    "explicitly @xmath123 where each term in the sum in ( [ ab ] ) comes from the corresponding term in the sum in ( [ ra ] ) .    due to the fact that @xmath124",
    ", we have @xmath125 .",
    "to compute @xmath126 , we consider the derivative of the mode @xmath127(@xmath128 ) : @xmath129 where we define @xmath130 when @xmath131 and zero otherwise . on the other hand ,",
    "the laguerre polynomials verify @xmath132 and thus @xmath133 where @xmath134 the matrix element @xmath135 results , after some straightforward operations , @xmath136 where we use @xmath137 .",
    "( in units of @xmath93 ) , as a function of @xmath138 , for @xmath139 ( continuous ) and @xmath140 ( dotted ) . ]    the last integral in ( [ ag ] ) is given in energy representation by @xmath141 ^ 2.\\label{ah}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] making use of ( [ ae ] ) we get @xmath142 these expressions can be readily computed .",
    "the results confirm the expectations : the value of @xmath143 is near @xmath144 , the closer to it the larger @xmath138 .",
    "we plot this behaviour in fig .",
    "3 . notice that ( [ ah ] ) is nothing else but the variance @xmath145 for the mode @xmath95 , something explicit after ( [ ag ] ) .",
    "it is possible to build minimal uncertainty packets by combining different modes with appropriate coefficients .",
    "instead , we will show how close the packets are to the lowest uncertainty .",
    "we do this in fig .",
    "4 . perhaps , the most prominent feature of these uncertainty relations is that the lowest uncertainty reached for each mode is bounded by @xmath146 , an asymptotic value corresponding to @xmath147 . on the other hand ,",
    "the uncertainty remains bounded for the cases of physical interest .     as a function of @xmath138 , for @xmath148 .",
    "]    finally , we look for the time of arrival at @xmath20 of some state @xmath149 .",
    "we describe the state by a ket to avoid unwieldy notation , but the discussion could apply equally to density matrices . working in parallel to what done to get ( [ d ] ) and ( [ e ] ) , we could give the modes for mean time of arrival @xmath114 at @xmath20 with direction @xmath150 ( for right and left movers respectively ) .",
    "they are given by : @xmath151 the notation @xmath152 stands for the dispersion relation governing the system .     for @xmath153 , @xmath140 and @xmath154 .",

    "we choose the case of a massless particle where @xmath156 .",
    "this not only avoids square roots but focus on the very interesting case of photons .",
    "in fact for a photon  @xcite we could use @xmath157 , whose schrdinger equation reads @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the photon spin . admitting the quantum leap involved in reducing this to one space dimension",
    ", it would translate into @xmath160 .",
    "this is what we are using for the dispersion relation . by decomposing the state in terms of the modes @xmath161 ,",
    "one gets after some computation that @xmath162 where @xmath163 . in figs . 5 and 6 we plot these quantities for two cases of interest .",
    "notice the distribution of of these values around @xmath164 .",
    "this was expected .",
    "notice also the zero at this value .",
    "this is just the modes orthogonality .     for @xmath153 , @xmath140 and @xmath117 .",
    "we have constructed a representation for time and energy in which both operate in a selfadjoint manner .",
    "the representation has the nice property of being suitable for probabilistic interpretation .",
    "it is given in terms of a set of modes build in terms of laguerre polynomials and their weight functions .",
    "this allows to surmount quite easily the difficulties associated to the different support of the energy and time spectra .",
    "these difficulties not only translate into the pauli theorem , but also prevent some asymptotic behaviour of the modes , precisely the more interesting from the physical point of view  @xcite . according to the paley wiener theorem xii  @xcite ,",
    "it is not possible to get exponential asymptotic behaviour for the functions of time that are fourier transforms of bounded functions of energy .",
    "here , we dealt with the problem by using our modes .",
