    "the shape of the stellar body of a galaxy reflects its formation process .",
    "reconstructing the intrinsic , three - dimensional shapes of spiral galaxies from their shapes projected on the sky has a long tradition , and proved to be an exquisitely accurate and precise approach , especially once sample size increased ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results provided us with the general notion that the stellar bodies of present - day star - forming galaxies over a wide range in luminosity can be described as thin , nearly oblate ( therefore , disk - like ) systems with an intrinsic short - to - long axis ratio of @xmath10 .",
    "such global shapes encompass all galactic components , including bars and bulges .",
    "the disk component is generally thinner ( @xmath11 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "analogous information about the progenitors of today s galaxies is scarcer . among faint , blue galaxies in deep hubble space telescope imaging",
    ", @xcite found a substantial population of elongated ` chain ' galaxies , but several authors argued that chain galaxies are edge - on disk galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that the ellipticity distribution of a large sample of @xmath12 lyman break galaxies is inconsistent with randomly oriented disk galaxies , lending credence to the interpretation that a class of intrinsically elongated ( or , prolate ) objects in fact exists at high redshift . by modeling ellipticity distributions",
    ", @xcite and @xcite concluded that the intrinsic shapes of @xmath13 star - forming galaxies are strongly triaxial .    on the other hand ,",
    "regular rotation is commonly seen amongst @xmath14 samples @xcite , and the evidence for the existence of gaseous disks is ample among massive systems @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy between the geometric and kinematic shape inferences is a dependence of structure on galaxy mass . indeed , for lower - mass galaxies ( @xmath15 )",
    "the evidence for rotation is less convincing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in rare cases rotation is convincingly ruled out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the prevailing view is that the gas and hence presumably the stars that form from it  in those galaxies is supported by random motions rather than ordered rotation . however , the kinematic measurements for low - mass galaxies probe only a small number of spatial resolution elements  signs of rotation may be smeared out @xcite  and the observed motions may have a non - gravitational origin such as feedback .    here",
    "we aim to provide the first description of the geometric shape distribution of @xmath4 star - forming galaxies and its dependence on galaxy mass .",
    "we examine the projected axis ratio distributions ( @xmath16 ) of large samples of star - forming galaxies out to @xmath17 drawn from the candels @xcite and 3d - hst @xcite surveys .",
    "a low - redshift comparison sample is drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the methodology developed by @xcite and @xcite will be used to convert @xmath16 into 3-dimensional shape distributions of star - forming galaxies and its evolution from @xmath17 to the present day .",
    "we construct volume - limited samples of star - forming galaxies over a large range in stellar mass ( @xmath1 ) and redshift ( @xmath0 ) with @xmath18 measured at an approximately fixed rest - frame wavelength of @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite provide wfc3/f125w+f140w+f160w - selected , multi - wavelength catalogs for the candels fields , as well as redshifts , stellar masses and rest - frame colors using the 3d - hst wfc3 grism spectroscopy in addition to the photometry .",
    "36,653 star - forming galaxies with stellar masses @xmath20 and up to redshift @xmath17 are selected based on their rest - frame @xmath21 and @xmath22 colors as described by @xcite , 35,832 of which have @xmath18 measurements . the typical accuracy and precision is better than 10% @xcite . for the @xmath23 galaxies we use the f160w - based values , for the @xmath24 galaxies we use the f125w - based values , such that all @xmath4 galaxies have their shapes measured at a rest - frame wavelength as close as possible to @xmath19 ( and always in the range @xmath25 ) .",
    "this avoids the effects due the shape variations with wavelength seen in local galaxies @xcite .    below @xmath26",
    "our f125w shape measurements probe longer wavelengths .",
    "we compared the f125w - based shapes with hst / acs f814w - based shapes for 1,365 galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the median f125w - based axis ratio is 0.014 larger than the median f814w - based shape , with a scatter of 0.06 .",
    "this is consistent with the measurement errors .",
    "we conclude that using f125w axis ratios at @xmath27 does not affect our results .",
    "sdss photometry - based stellar masses from @xcite are used to select 36,369 star - forming galaxies with stellar masses @xmath20 and in the ( spectroscopic ) redshift range @xmath28 .",
    "the distinction between star - forming and passive galaxies is described by @xcite and is based on the rest - frame @xmath29 and @xmath30 colors , analogous to the use of @xmath21 and @xmath22 colors at higher redshifts . for the sdss sample we use the @xmath18 estimates from fitting the exponential surface brightness model to the @xmath31-band imaging as part of the dr7 photometric pipeline @xcite .",
    "these measurements have been verified by @xcite , who showed that systematic offsets and scatter with respect to our galfit  -based measurements are negligible .",
    "the very pronounced change of the projected shape distribution with redshift ( figure [ hist ] ) immediately reveals that galaxy structure evolves with cosmic time . especially at low stellar masses",
    "we see that a larger fraction of galaxies have flat projected shapes than at the present day .",
    "this observation underpins the analysis presented in the remainder of the letter . here",
    "we provide a brief description of the methodology to infer the intrinsic , 3-dimensional shapes of galaxies , outlined in detail by @xcite .",
    "we adopt the ellipsoid as the general geometric form to describe the shapes of galaxies .",
    "it has three , generally different , axis lengths ( @xmath32 ) , commonly used to define ellipticity ( @xmath33 ) and triaxiality ( @xmath34 ) . in order to facilitate an intuitive understanding of our results",
    "we define three broad geometric types , shown in figure [ class ] : _ disky _ ( @xmath35 ) , _ elongated _ ( @xmath36 ) , and _ spheroidal _ ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the goal is to find a model population of triaxial ellipsoids that , when seen under random viewing angles , has the same @xmath16 as an observed galaxy sample .",
    "our model population has gaussian distributions of the ellipticity ( with mean @xmath38 and standard deviation @xmath39 ) and triaxiality ( with mean @xmath40 and standard deviation @xmath41 ) .",
    "such a model population has a known @xmath16 which we adjust to include the effect of random uncertainties in the axis ratio measurements  these are asymmetric for nearly round objects .",
    "then , given that each observed value of @xmath18 corresponds to a known probability , we calculate the total likelihood of the model by multiplying the probabilities of each of the observed values .",
    "we search a grid of the four model parameters to find the maximal total likelihood .    in figure [ hist ]",
    "we show observed axis ratio distributions ( histograms ) , and the probability distributions of the corresponding best - fitting model populations ( smooth lines ) .",
    "the models generally match the data very well . even in the worst case ( bottom - right panel ) the model and data distributions are only marginally inconsistent , at the @xmath42 level .",
    "a triaxial model population with parameters @xmath43 corresponds to a cloud of points in figure [ class ] and , hence , with certain fractions of the three geometric types .",
    "the colored bars in figure [ hist ] represent these fractions for the best - fitting triaxial models .",
    "this illustrates the connection between projected shapes and intrinsic shapes : a broad @xmath16 reflects a large fraction of _ disky _ objects , whereas a narrow distribution with a peak at small @xmath18 is indicative of a large fraction of _ elongated _ objects . a narrow distribution with a peak at large @xmath18 would indicate a large fraction of _ spheroidal _ objects .    in figure [ res ]",
    "we provide the modeling results for the full redshift and mass range probed here : for each stellar mass bin we show the redshift evolution of the four model parameters , including the uncertainties obtained by bootstrapping the samples .",
    "finally , in figure [ frac ] we show the full set of results in the form of the color coding defined in figure [ class ] .",
    "the small values of @xmath40 and the large values of @xmath38 for present - day star - forming galaxies ( figure [ res ] ) imply that the vast majority are thin and nearly oblate .",
    "indeed , according to our classification shown in figure [ hist ] between 80% and 100% are _ disky _ , as is generally known and was demonstrated before on the basis of similar axis - ratio distribution analyses by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "importantly , the intrinsic shape distribution of star - forming galaxies does not change over a large range in stellar mass ( @xmath1 ) .    toward higher redshifts",
    "star - forming galaxies become gradually less disk - like ( figures [ hist ] , [ res ] and [ frac ] ) .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for low - mass galaxies .",
    "already in the @xmath44 redshift bin in figure [ res ] we see evolution , mostly in the scatter in triaxiality ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "that is , there is substantial variety in intrinsic galaxy shape . beyond @xmath26 ,",
    "galaxies with stellar mass @xmath5 typically do not have a _ disky _",
    "geometry , but are most often _ elongated _ ( figure [ res ] ) .",
    "galaxies with mass @xmath6 show similar behavior , but with evolution only apparent at @xmath13 .",
    "this geometric evidence for mass - dependent redshift evolution of galaxy structure is corroborated by the analysis of kinematic properties of @xmath45 galaxies by @xcite .",
    "_ disky _ objects are the most common type ( @xmath46 ) among galaxies with mass @xmath47 at all redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "a population of _ spheroidal _ galaxies is increasingly prominent among massive galaxies at @xmath48 .",
    "a visual inspection of such objects reveals that at least a subset are mergers , but an in - depth interpretation of this aspect we defer to another occasion .",
    "it is interesting to note that ellipticity hardly depends on mass and redshift ( figure [ res ] ) .",
    "that is , despite strong evolution in geometry , the short - to - long axis ratio remains remarkably constant with redshift , and changes little with galaxy mass .",
    "a joint analysis of galaxy size and shape is required to explore the possible implications .",
    "note that our definition of geometric shape is unrelated to the common distinction between disks and spheroids on the basis of their concentration parameter or srsic index . as a result",
    "we distinguish between the observation that most low - mass star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 have exponential surface brightness profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and our inference that these galaxies are not , generally , shaped like disks in a geometric sense .",
    "this illustrates that an approximately exponential light profile can correlate with the presence of a disk - like structure but can not be used as a definition of a disk .",
    "star formation in the present - day universe mostly takes place in @xmath49 galaxies and in non - starburst galaxies .",
    "since essentially all such star - forming galaxies are _ disky _ and star formation in disk galaxies occurs mostly over the full extent of the stellar disk , it follows immediately that essentially all current star formation takes place in disks .",
    "the analysis presented in this _",
    "letter _ allows us to generalize this conclusion to include earlier epochs .",
    "at least since @xmath8 most star formation is accounted for by @xmath50 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figures [ res ] and [ frac ] show that such galaxies have disk - like geometries over the same redshift range .",
    "given that 90% of stars in the universe formed over that time span , it follows that the majority of all stars in the universe formed in disk galaxies .",
    "combined with the evidence that star formation is spatially extended , and not , for example , concentrated in galaxy centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this implies that the vast majority of stars formed in disks .    despite this universal dominance of disks",
    ", the elongatedness of many low - mass galaxies at @xmath51 implies that the shape of a galaxy generally differs from that of a disk at early stages in its evolution .",
    "according to our results , an elongated , low - mass galaxy at @xmath52 will evolve into a disk at later times , or , reversing the argument , disk galaxies in the present - day universe do not initially start out disks .    as can be seen in figure [ res ] ,",
    "the transition from _ elongated _ to _ disky _ is gradual for the population .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for individual galaxies .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations indicate that sustained disks form quite suddenly , on a dynamical time scale , after an initial period characterized by rapidly changing dynamical configurations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this turbulent formation phase may include the subsequent formation and destruction of short - lived disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , associated with rapid changes in orientation and resulting in a hot stellar system of rather arbitrary shape .",
    "our observation that at @xmath4 the low - mass galaxy population consists of a mix of _ disky _ and _ elongated _ objects  in this picture , the latter represent the irregular phase without a sustained disk  can be interpreted as some fraction of the galaxies having already transformed into a sustained disk .",
    "the probability for this transition is , then , a function of mass which may or may not depend on redshift . given the various estimates of the stellar mass evolution of milky way - mass galaxies as a function of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we suggest that the milky way may have first attained a sustained stellar disk at redshift @xmath53 .",
    "our analysis rests on the assumption that stellar light traces the mass distribution of a galaxy .",
    "potential spoilers include obscuration by dust , dispersion in age among stars , and large gas fractions .",
    "dust has a viewing angle - dependent effect on the measured @xmath18 .",
    "massive galaxies at all redshifts are dusty , and a large variety of dust geometries could disturb axis ratio measurements , hiding the disk - like structure of the population when traced by the axis ratio distribution . perhaps this plays a role at @xmath48 where we see an increased fraction of round objects .",
    "however , the reverse  to create a disk - like axis ratio distribution for a population of dusty non - disks  requires unlikely fine tuning .",
    "we prefer the more straightforward interpretation that massive , star - forming galaxies truly are disks , at least up to @xmath54 .",
    "this is supported by the observed correlation between axis ratio and color ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also seen in our sample : galaxies with smaller @xmath18 are redder than those with larger @xmath18 , as expected from a population on inclined , dusty disks .",
    "dust is also unlikely to affect @xmath16 of low - mass galaxies . at @xmath4 galaxies with stellar masses @xmath15",
    "are generally very blue . for these young",
    ", presumably metal - poor galaxies dust is of limited relevance to the shape measurements .",
    "this also implies that completeness of our sample is not affected by strong dust obscuration .",
    "age variations in the stellar population and large gas fractions both potentially present challenges to our assumption that the rest - frame optical light traces the underlying mass distribution .",
    "perhaps the luminous regions are young , bright complexes embedded in disks consisting of cold gas or fainter , older stellar populations .",
    "we can not immediately discard this possibility as dynamical masses exceed stellar masses by an average factor of @xmath55 in the stellar mass range @xmath56 galaxies at @xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is implausible that this difference between stellar mass and dynamical mass is entirely made up of undetected , older stars in a disk - like configuration .",
    "the different spatial distributions of the young and old stars would lead to wavelength - dependent shapes , which is not observed .",
    "if such a population of older stars is present , it must be spatially coincident with the young population , and not , generally , in a disk .",
    "we can not exclude the existence of cold gas disks that are @xmath573@xmath58 more massive than the ( young ) stellar population .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show that low - mass , high - redshift systems can produce elongated stellar bodies embedded in more extended , turbulent gaseous bodies with ordered rotation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the moment there is little observational evidence for such extended gaseous disks . for the mass range @xmath59 gas masses in excess of the stellar mass",
    "have been inferred based on the star - formation rate and the inverse kennicutt - schmidt relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this inversion relies on the assumption of a disk - like geometry , weakening the argument .",
    "furthermore , even if these cold gas mass estimates are correct it is not clear that the gas should be organized in a disk .",
    "generally , gas ionized by star formation and cold gas share global kinematic traits , and in these cases the ionized gas does not generally show rotation .",
    "deep alma observations will settle this issue , and for now we will leave this as the main caveat in our analysis .",
    "we have analyzed the projected axis ratio distributions , @xmath16 , measured at rest - frame optical wavelenghts , of stellar mass - selected samples of star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 drawn from sdss and 3d - hst+candels .",
    "the intrinsic , 3-dimensional geometric shape distribution is reconstructed under the assumption that the population consists of triaxial objects view under random viewing angles .    in the present - day universe",
    "star - forming galaxies of all masses are predominantly oblate and flat , that is , they are disks .",
    "massive galaxies ( @xmath2 ) typically have this shape at all redshifts @xmath60 .",
