    "[ intro ]    it is well known that various interesting string vacua are described by free conformal field theories ( cft ) with twisted ( _ i.e. _ periodic up to a phase ) boundary conditions on the world - sheet fields .",
    "this happens in the case of orbifolds for closed strings  @xcite , and , with the doubling trick , also for the open strings stretched between intersecting  @xcite or magnetized d - branes  @xcite . in these cases",
    "the 2-dimensional equations of motions take the usual form of the free wave equation , but the boundary conditions on the world - sheet fields can change ; in particular this happens in the interactions between closed strings belonging to different twisted sectors or open strings stretched between different d - branes .",
    "the cft operators implementing a change in the boundary conditions for the bosonic coordinates are called twist fields and are rather complicated objects from the world - sheet point of view . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath2 to indicate a twists field changing the boundary conditions of a complexified bosonic coordinate by a phase @xmath3 . in superstring theories ,",
    "a similar pattern is present also in the fermionic sector ; however in this case the operators changing the boundary conditions ( called spin fields ) can be described in terms of simple free fields thanks to the bosonization equivalence . in this paper",
    "we will exclusively focus on the bosonic twist fields for which no simple free theory description is known .",
    "the couplings among 3-twist fields are important in various context , in particular in string compactifications that display realistic phenomenological features , where they are directly related to the yukawa couplings of the low energy effective action .",
    "the twist fields correlators are usually computed by using the techniques introduced in  @xcite . in the context of closed string theory on orbifolds these techniques",
    "were applied to the computation of yukawa couplings in  @xcite .",
    "more recently other semi - realistic string vacua have been under intense study : in this case the standard model fields are realized by means of open strings stretched between intersecting or magnetized d - branes . from a cft point of view , the main ingredient in the determination of the yukawa couplings in these models is the evaluation of a 3-twist coupling . by following the prescription of  @xcite , the twist - fields correlators in open string setups have been studied in detail by  @xcite .",
    "another very important quantity that can be computed in string configurations with twisted boundary conditions is the partition function .",
    "this can be seen as a contribution to the cosmological constant and thus serves , in orbifold compactifications , as a check of whether supersymmetry is broken or not in the twisted sectors  @xcite . in open string configurations",
    "the partition function captures the d - brane dynamics and string coordinates with non - trivial monodromies appear when the d - branes support constant electro - magnetic fields  @xcite or have constant velocity  @xcite .",
    "twisted partition functions are of interest also in topological string theory and heterotic strings , see for example  @xcite for recent applications .",
    "in this paper we use the operator formalism  @xcite to compute the twisted partition function for open bosonic strings in a generic toroidal compactification . for concreteness , we work in the setup of open strings stretched between magnetized d - branes , where the parameters @xmath4 depend on the magnetic fields on the d - branes .",
    "this setup is more general than the one usually encountered in orbifold compactifications , because the twists @xmath4 are generically non - rational numbers . in this paper",
    "we make two simplifying assumptions : we require that the d - branes wrap only once the geometrical torus and impose that the world - volume magnetic fluxes commute , see  .",
    "while the first assumption provides just a technical simplification , the presence of non - abelian backgrounds would make the problem rather more difficult .",
    "we hope to relax these hypothesis in a future work .",
    "we will start our computation in the closed string channel , where the main ingredient is the boundary state describing a magnetized d - brane ( see  @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "we follow the approach of  @xcite and build a surface with @xmath0 borders starting from a vertex describing the interaction among @xmath0 closed strings .",
    "the two main novelties in the present computation are the use of magnetized boundary states and the analysis of the contribution of winding or kaluza - klein modes present in the compact case . then by using the results of",
    "@xcite we exploit the modular properties of string amplitudes to rewrite the same diagram with magnetized d - branes in the open string channel .",
    "all our expressions are written in terms of geometrical quantities that commonly appear in the study of riemann surfaces , such as the period matrix or the riemann class .",
    "in particular , in our case the prym differentials , which are 1-forms with non - trivial monodromies , play a crucial role .",
    "the operator formalism naturally gives for all these quantities , including the prym differentials  @xcite , an explicit expression in terms of sums or products over the schottky group .",
    "even if we use as starting point a setup with magnetized d - branes , we can easily perform a t - duality at any step of the computation .",
    "so , in our approach , the computations in the intersecting and in the magnetized descriptions are essentially on the same footing . in principle , for rational twists @xmath4 , an expression for the twisted partition function could be derived from the higher genus correlation functions studied in  @xcite , but , to the best of our knowledge , this has not been done explicitly .    in a second part of the paper",
    "we specialize to the @xmath5 case for @xmath1 and show explicitly that the twisted partition function can be used also to derive the correlators among three twist fields and thus the yukawa couplings in models with magnetized d - branes .",
    "the idea is simple : instead of following  @xcite and factorizing the 4-point tree - level amplitude , we derive the couplings among twist fields by factorizing the planar 2-loop vacuum diagram in the open string channel as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fact ] .",
    "fact.pstex_t    this alternative option was already proposed in  @xcite , where the formal properties of higher loop amplitudes were studied .",
    "however this program has not been carried out explicitly in any concrete case and probably the main stumbling point has been so far the lack of explicit enough formulae for the multiloop twisted partition function itself . at first sight , the idea of factorizing loop instead of tree amplitudes may seem an unnecessary complication .",
    "actually it turns out that for certain purposes it is technically easier to follow this path .",
    "for instance , in the case of the multiloop partition function , it is easier to control the overall @xmath4-dependent normalization , since it is directly related to the tension of the d - branes .",
    "moreover the computation of the partition function in our formalism is completely algorithmic and does not require any space - time intuition .",
    "in fact we will derive the yukawa couplings directly in a type iib setup , thus providing , without the need of any t - duality , a string counterpart of the field theory computation of ref .",
    "however , as we already said , t - dualities can be easily performed in our approach .",
    "so one can see that , in a type iia setup , the zero - mode contribution to the partition function depends on the khler moduli and , after factorization , reproduces exactly the world - sheet instanton contribution to the yukawa couplings for intersecting brane configurations .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section  2",
    "we summarize the main properties of open and closed bosonic strings in toroidal compactification and fix our conventions , see  @xcite for more details . in section  3",
    "we generalize the approach of  @xcite and compute the twisted partition function on a @xmath6 for a planar orientable riemann surface with @xmath0 borders and no handles .",
    "we first work in the closed string channel where the amplitudes is obtained by sewing together @xmath0 boundary states on a sphere .",
    "then we perform a modular transformation and translate the result in the open string channel .",
    "this is done by using the generalization of the product formulae for the theta functions derived in  @xcite . in section  4",
    "we focus on the @xmath1 partition function for a 2-torus and study the limit where the surface degenerates in two disks connected by three open string propagators . as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fact ] , this allows us to derive the 3-string coupling among twisted states .",
    "we first consider the non - zero mode contribution which is the only one present in the uncompact space .",
    "the contribution to the 3-twist couplings derived in this way is usually indicated as the quantum ( from the world - sheet point of view ) part .",
    "then we study the factorization of the full twisted partition function on @xmath5 . in this way we obtain the full 3-twist couplings , including what is usually called the classical contribution .",
    "our results for these couplings are in agreement with previous works  @xcite , thus providing a very non - trivial test for the expression of the twisted partition function we obtained .",
    "[ conv ]        going to the closed string sector , we will use the following conventions : x^m_cl(z,|z ) =  ,  where   x_cl^m(z ) = ^m - _ 0^m z+ _ m=0 , with the commutation relations = n_n , m g^mn   ,  and   [ ^m,_0^n ] = g^mn  , and similarly in the right - moving sector .",
    "when convenient , we will also use the normalized oscillators @xmath49 or @xmath50 , with @xmath51 ,   @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    from the closed string point of view",
    ", the d - branes are described by boundary states @xmath55 , that enforce an identification between the left and the right moving modes  . in order to write this identification in the closed string channel , it is convenient to map the upper - half complex plane @xmath56 into the circle of unit radius @xmath57",
    ". thus we get [ bc - cl ] eq .",
    "x^m(w,1/|w)|_=0=-(r_i)^m _",
    "nx^n(w,1/|w)|_=0  . at the level of closed string modes",
    "this condition reads [ rcl2 ] |b_i=0 ,  n z  .",
    "notice that the closed strings modes are integer as usual , and the magnetic fields @xmath15 enter only in the gluing conditions .",
    "thus , contrary to what happens for the twisted open strings , the closed string spectrum is unaffected by the magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , the allowed winding and kaluza - klein modes are encoded in the narain lattice which depends only on @xmath44 and @xmath13 . in our conventions",
    "the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 are [ nar - lat ] ( _ 0)^m =  ,   ( _ 0)^m = . in terms of the kaluza - klein and windings mode ,",
    "the identification   enforced by the boundary state ( for @xmath60 ) is independent of the closed string background and reads simply [ rcl3 ] n_m = -2 ( f_i)_mn m^n  .",
    "let us end our brief comments on the string spectrum on magnetized tori by noticing that it is easy to generalize this analysis to all other configurations that are connected by t - duality to the case of magnetized d - branes .",
    "a generic t - duality transformation is encoded in a @xmath61 matrix [ t ] t = (    cc a_m^  n & b_mn + c^mn & d^m _",
    "n    )  ,  with   ^tca + ^ tac = ^tbd+ ^tdb = 0  ,   ^tad+^tcb=1 . where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath37 are @xmath36 matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath65 acts on the combination @xmath66 as follows ( see  @xcite for a review and @xmath67 are exchanged with respect to  @xcite ] ) [ sodd ] ( g+b ) = ^-1 .",
    "the same t - duality transformation is realized at the level of oscillators by multiplying the left and right - moving modes by specific matrices : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where the primed oscillators are those obtained after the t - duality and [ tpm ] ( t_+)^m_n = \\{^-1}^m _  n  ,   ( t_-)^m_n = \\{^-1}^m _  n  . notice that by using   one can prove that @xmath70 . from   we immediately see that upon t - duality the reflection matrices change in a very simple way @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that the monodromy matrices @xmath30 change by a similarity transformation and that the twists @xmath72 are invariant under t - duality . in particular , we can easily describe within the formalism of reflection and monodromy matrices also d - branes at angles",
    "this situation is characterized by symmetric reflections matrices that square to one . if all @xmath27 s can be brought in this form by means of the same t - duality transformation @xmath65",
    ", then it means that the d - brane setup can be geometrized completely and described in terms of d - branes at angles .",
    "[ pf ]      the vacuum diagram we will compute has @xmath0 borders on different d - branes and no handles or crosscaps . in order to avoid the subtleties of the case with multiple wrappings  @xcite",
    ", we will take all @xmath73 s in   to be equal one .",
    "moreover we will take a second simplifying hypothesis and focus on the case of commuting fluxes . in formulae ,",
    "our setup will satisfy [ commute ] l_im = 1  ,  and   [ g^-1 f_i , g^-1 f_j ] = 0  ,  i , j=0,  ,g  . where @xmath44 and @xmath74 are viewed as space - time matrices .",
    "commutativity implies that all reflection matrices @xmath27 can be diagonalized simultaneously and so the eigenvalues @xmath75 of the monodromy matrices @xmath30 are simply @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the eigenvalues of @xmath27 .",
    "the computation of this partition function in the closed string channel can be performed by using the boundary states formalism .",
    "this approach was used in  @xcite for the case of unmagnetized d - branes and here we will follow the same steps , the main difference being that in the present case the reflection matrices @xmath27 contain generic phases and not just @xmath78 . if we start from an off - shell closed string vertex in the @xmath56 coordinates   describing the emission of @xmath0 states and insert a first boundary state , then we get a disk parametrized as the upper half complex plane , where the real axis represents the boundary we have just inserted . on the contrary if we had worked in the @xmath79 coordinates  , we would have obtained the disk of unit radius .",
    "let us focus on the @xmath56 coordinates and saturate the remaining @xmath80 off - shell states with other boundary states .",
    "each insertion cuts out a small disk in the upper half complex plane plus an image in the lower part and the circle and its image are identified .",
    "these non overlapping disks are completely specified by the @xmath81 matrices [ scl ] s_^cl = (    cc a_^cl & b_^cl + c_^cl & d_^cl    ) (    cc _ - q_| _ & -|_|^2 ( 1-q _ ) + ( 1-q _ ) & q_- | _    )  , with @xmath82 .",
    "the centers of the disks are in @xmath83 ( and @xmath84 for the images ) and the radii ( common to the disks and their images ) are @xmath85 . thus we get a world - sheet parameterization as in fig .",

    "so we get the correct dimension ( @xmath91 ) for a the moduli space of a disk with @xmath0 boundaries .",

    "the interaction vertices are written in terms of a simple representation of the schottky group  @xcite .",

    "the insertion of the first boundary states @xmath349 has the effect of mixing left and the right moving modes .",
    "this can be easily seen for the non - zero mode sector , where the boundary state simply transforms the @xmath350 into creation operators @xmath351 . when the scalar product over the @xmath352 hilbert space is computed , the exponential factors at the left containing the destruction modes @xmath353 are glued together with the exponentials at the right containing the creation modes @xmath351 .",
