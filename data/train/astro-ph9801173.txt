    "many efforts have been made to understand the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) . recently in the _ rosat _ deep surveys , @xmath7 60% of the cxb in the 0.52  kev band has been resolved into discrete sources ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , in the harder 210  kev band , where the bulk of the energy density of the cxb resides ,",
    "only @xmath8% of the cxb was resolved into discrete sources ( @xcite ) . in the soft x - ray band ( 0.52  kev ) type",
    "1 agns are the main contributers to the cxb within a flux level of @xmath9 @xmath10  ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , they have x - ray power - law spectra ( @xmath11 , @xcite ) significantly softer than that of the cxb in the 210  kev band ( @xmath12 , @xcite , @xcite ) . therefore , there must be objects which have harder x - ray spectra than type 1  agns and contribute significantly to the cxb in this band .",
    "to study the nature of x - ray sources in the hard band , we are now conducting an unbiased large and deep survey with the _ asca _ ( @xcite ) near the north galactic pole .",
    "this is the large sky survey ( hereafter lss , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the flux limit of the lss ( @xmath7 1 @xmath13 @xmath10 in the 210  kev band ) is 100 times deeper than the _ heao1 _  a2 survey , which was the deepest survey in the hard band ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have surveyed 7.0 deg@xmath14 and detected 43 sources above the 4@xmath15 level in the 210 kev band ( @xcite ) , corresponding to @xmath7 30% of the cxb in this band .",
    "the average photon index of the x - ray sources detected in the flux range between 1 @xmath13 and 5 @xmath13 @xmath10is @xmath16 ( @xcite ) , which is significantly harder than the spectra of x - ray sources detected in shallower surveys in the 210  kev band and close to that of the cxb .",
    "thus , we are now revealing the presence of the hard sources which are responsible for most of the cxb energy density .",
    "identification of these hard sources is clearly an important next step .    in the lss",
    ", we have discovered the very hard x - ray source ax  j131501 + 3141 whose power - law index is by far the hardest among the lss sources .",
    "this object provides a good opportunity to examine the nature of the hard x - ray sources found in our systematic survey , and the result will be a key for the understanding of the origin of the cxb in the hard band . in this paper",
    ", we report on the optical identification and properties of ax  j131501 + 3141 , and their implications for the origins of the cxb .",
    "results of the x - ray observations are presented in detail in a separate paper ( @xcite ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we use @xmath17 and @xmath18 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "ax  j131501 + 3141 is the hardest x - ray source detected in the lss .",
    "the apparent x - ray spectrum from its initial observation can be fitted by a single power - law model with a photon index @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in 0.7  10 kev band . since the photon indices of the other x - ray sources detected in the lss are distributed between 0.4 and 4.0 in the flux range from 1 @xmath13 to 1 @xmath21 @xmath10(210  kev ) , the photon index of ax  j131501 + 3141 is outstandingly hard",
    ".    subsequently deeper x - ray observations of this object totaling 100,000  s were made to learn more details of its x - ray properties ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results given in sakano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are as follows .",
    "the flux of ax  j131501 + 3141 in the 210  kev band is @xmath22 @xmath10 , while in the 0.5  2 kev band no x - ray flux is detected above a 3 sigma level and the corresponding upper limit is @xmath23 @xmath10 .",
    "the x - ray spectral shape seems to be a power law with a low energy cut - off at @xmath24  kev ; the best fitted parameters are @xmath0 and absorbing column density @xmath1 @xmath2 in the observed frame .",
    "the galactic column density of neutral hydrogen in this direction is @xmath25 @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the deep observations were made at two epochs ( 1995 december and 1996 june ) and 30% variability was detected . from the deep x - ray observations , the position of ax  j131501 + 3141 is accurately determined to be @xmath26=13@xmath2715@xmath28 , @xmath29=31@xmath3041@xmath3128@xmath32 ( j2000 ) with an error radius of @xmath33 ( 95% confidence ) .      to identify the optical counterpart of ax  j131501 + 3141 , we made imaging observations with a tektronix 2048@xmath342048 ccd on the university of hawaii 88@xmath35 telescope in 1996 april .",
    "images were obtained in two bands , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with a spatial sampling of @xmath38  pix@xmath5 .",
    "the exposure times were 20 and 15 min for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 bands , respectively .",

    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath37 band image centered on the position of ax  j131501 + 3141 with its error circle of radius @xmath33 . in the error circle",
    ", there are one bright galaxy and a few faint objects .",
    "the coordinates of the bright galaxy are @xmath26=13@xmath2715@xmath4101@xmath42 , @xmath29=31@xmath3041@xmath3128@xmath43 ( j2000 ) , which is only @xmath44 from the best position of the x - ray source .",
    "hence this is the most promising candidate for the optical counterpart .",
    "the galaxy has total magnitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and is cataloged as an s0 galaxy with @xmath47 in slezak et al .",
    "hereafter , we call this bright galaxy `` galaxy  a '' .",
    "the other objects in the error circle are fainter than @xmath48 .",
    "since type  1 agns are the most x - ray loud objects among the known extragalactic x - ray sources , we expect that the optical counterpart of ax j131501 + 3141 must be brighter than @xmath49 on the basis of its 210  kev x - ray flux , assuming @xmath50 together with the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of type  1 agns identified in the cambridge - cambridge _ rosat _ serendipity survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath48 is more than one order of magnitude fainter , none of these other objects are likely to be the optical counterpart .",
    "the chance probability of one galaxy brighter than 16.0 mag falling in the error circle of the x - ray source is only 8 @xmath51 .",
    "this is obtained by adopting a surface density of such galaxies of 38 deg@xmath52 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this low probability reinforces the conclusion that the galaxy  a is the optical counterpart of ax  j131501 + 3141 .      in the error circle of ax",
    "j131501 + 3141 , a radio source is detected in the first survey .",
    "the first survey is a radio source survey conducted with the very large array in the 1.4 ghz band with a @xmath53 limiting flux of 1  mjy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinates of the radio source are @xmath26=13@xmath2715@xmath4101@xmath54.19 , @xmath29=31@xmath3041@xmath3129@xmath32.1 ( j2000 ) , which is very close ( @xmath55 ) to the center of galaxy  a ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the radio source is point - like and no structure can be seen .",
    "considering the positional accuracy of the radio source ( @xmath55 ) and that of the optical galaxy center ( @xmath56 ) , we regard the radio source as being associated with the center of galaxy  a.    in the course of the optical follow - up program of the lss , we examined the distribution of first radio sources around lss x - ray sources to evaluate the cross - correlation between radio and x - ray sources , and found a @xmath57 correlation within a radius of @xmath58 from the x - ray sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "this radius corresponds to the error radius of the x - ray source positions .",
    "the presence of a significant correlation between the radio and x - ray sources implies that a first radio source within @xmath58 of an lss x - ray source is the radio counterpart of the x - ray source with a probability of more than 80% .",
    "this is an additional reason why galaxy  a , which is also the radio source detected near the center of the error circle of ax  j131501 + 3141 , is very likely to be the optical counterpart of the x - ray source .    in summary , considering all the results discussed in  2 , we conclude that galaxy  a and its central radio source are to be identified with ax  j131501 + 3141 . in the next section",
    ", we will present further evidence on the nature of galaxy  a.",
    "we made a spectroscopic observation of ax  j131501 + 3141 ( galaxy  a ) with the multi - slit spectrograph ( cryocam ) on the kpno mayall 4 m telescope on 1996 april 9 .",
    "we used grism 730 and covered the spectral range from 6000   to 9000    with a resolution of 22  .",
    "we used a @xmath59 wide slit .",
    "the spectral sampling was 4.3   pix@xmath5 and the spatial resolution was @xmath60  pix@xmath5 .",
    "the fwhm of the seeing was @xmath55 .",

    "the spectrum was summed within a @xmath61 width along the slit direction ( p.a .",
    "@xmath62 ) centered on the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "we detected emission lines of h@xmath26 , [ n  ii]@xmath636548,6583 , and [ sii]@xmath636717,6731 clearly but no broad h@xmath26 emission line .",
    "the logarithmic line ratios are log([n  ii]@xmath646583/h@xmath26)=0.28 and log([s  ii]@xmath646717 + 6731/h@xmath26)=@xmath65 , which imply that this object is classified as a type  2 seyfert or liner ( @xcite ) . to be more definitive in the classification , spectrum in the blue wavelength region",
    "is needed .",
    "the redshift of this object turned out to be @xmath66 and the resulting luminosities are @xmath67 = 2 @xmath68 ergs  s@xmath5 in the 210  kev band after absorption - correction and @xmath6 mag without k - correction .",
    "the power of the nuclear activity in the hard x - ray band is as large as that of a typical seyfert galaxy ( the knee of the luminosity function of type  1 agns is @xmath69 erg  s@xmath5 in the 0.53.5  kev band according to @xcite ) .    in order to obtain a spectrum in a blue region",
    ", we made another spectroscopic observation of galaxy  a with the kpno 2.1 m telescope and the goldcam spectrograph on 1997 june 8 .",
    "three 30 min exposures were taken through a @xmath70 slit at p.a.= 90@xmath30 .",
    "the spectra covered the wavelength range 38667511  with a spectral resolution of 5.1 .",
    "the uncertainty in the wavelength scale is 0.1  .",
    "the flux from the nuclear region dominates the optical spectrum and it is only slightly resolved spatially in this observation .",
    "therefore , we summed the spectrum using an optimal extraction method applied to a @xmath71 window along the slit . atmospheric absorption band correction and flux calibration",
    "were then carried out with the help of spectra of standard stars .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we can clearly see emission lines of [ o  ii]@xmath643727 , h@xmath72 , [ o  iii]@xmath634959,5007 , h@xmath26 , [ n  ii]@xmath636548,6583 , and [ sii]@xmath636717,6731 .",
    "the continuum contains a great deal of starlight , as evidenced by the ca  ii h & k , h@xmath73 , mg  i  b , and na  i  d absorption lines .",
    "also , the h@xmath72 line shows an absorption plus emission structure . in order to obtain the more accurate measurements of the weak emission lines",
    ", we must subtract the stellar continuum spectrum .",
    "the model spectrum consists of an elliptical galaxy stellar template ( ngc  5332 ) and a featureless power - law continuum , with the relative strengths of the two components adjusted to provide the smoothest fit to the continuum in the neighborhood of the emission lines .",
    "the spectrum obtained is also shown in figure [ fig2 ] . using the subtracted spectrum ( figure [ fig2]b dashed line ) , fluxes of the emission lines can be measured more accurately , though there are still obvious residuals due to the mismatch between the stellar populations of the two galaxies .",
    "the resulting logarithmic line ratios turn out to be log([n  ii]@xmath646583/h@xmath26 ) = 0.06 , log([s  ii]@xmath646717 + 6731/h@xmath26 ) = @xmath74 , and log([o  iii]@xmath645007/h@xmath72 ) = 0.65 ( see table [ tab2 ] ) . the ratio of [ o  iii]@xmath645007/h@xmath72 implies that the galaxy  a is a seyfert rather than liner ( @xcite ) .",
    "these emission lines were resolved in the spectrum , with widths all approximately the same and consistent with fwhm = @xmath75 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "there is no hint of the presence of a broad - line component of h@xmath26 or h@xmath72 , even after subtraction of the continuum .",
    "therefore we conclude galaxy  a is classified as a type  2 seyfert .",
    "one interesting feature in the spectrum is that the intensity of [ o  ii]@xmath643727 emission line is strong in galaxy  a. in the [ o  ii]@xmath643727/[o  iii]@xmath645007 vs. [ o  iii]@xmath645007/h@xmath72 plane ( @xcite ) , galaxy  a is located between typical type  2 seyferts and liners due to its large log([o  ii]@xmath643727/[o  iii]@xmath645007 ) values ( 0.004 ) . after correcting for reddening using the large balmer decrement ( h@xmath26/h@xmath72 = 7.58 ) , galaxy  a falls among typical liners in this diagram because of the resulting larger value of log([o  ii]@xmath643727/[o  iii]@xmath645007 ) = 0.36 .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the ratio of the oxygen emission lines : 1 ) a small ionization parameter ( u @xmath76 ) in the nucleus , similar to liners , and 2 ) contamination by starforming regions in the disk of the galaxy , which would enhance [ o  ii]@xmath643727 relative to [ o  iii]@xmath645007 .",
    "we favor the second explanation because a liner classification is not supported by the other defining line ratio , [ o  i]@xmath646300/[o  iii]@xmath645007 , which is less than 1/3 in this spectrum , and also because the distribution of the h@xmath26 emission along the slit in the spectra taken with the 2.1 m telescope is slightly more extended than that of [ n  ii]@xmath646583 .",
    "the spatial extent of the h@xmath26 line is 4.2  pix fwhm ( @xmath77 ) , while that of [ n  ii]@xmath646583 is 3.7  pix ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "unfortunately we can not separate the nuclear component from an extended component in [ o  ii]@xmath643727 and h@xmath72 the signal - to - noise ratios of the lines are low and since the focus of the spectrum at the blue end is poor .",
    "the difference between h@xmath26 and [ n  ii]@xmath646583 region is also confirmed in the spectrum taken with the 4 m telescope .",
    "in addition , the color of the disk of galaxy  a is @xmath79 , which is bluer than the bulge of the galaxy . these results suggest there is some contamination to the nuclear emission lines by star formation in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the optical image ( figure [ fig1 ] ) of ax  j131501 + 3141 shows no point - like structure at the center of the galaxy , suggesting that the majority of the optical continuum photons in the central region of the galaxy originate in stars in the bulge . the column density to the nuclear x - ray source ,",
    "@xmath80  @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , corresponds to @xmath81 mag according to the relations",
    "@xmath82 @xmath2  mag@xmath5 ( @xcite ) and @xmath83 = 3.14 ( @xcite ) , which is large enough to hide the optical nuclear source .",
    "thus the absence of a blue point - like nuclear source in the optical light is consistent with the large column density derived from the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the large balmer decrement ( h@xmath26/h@xmath72 = 7.58 ) could be the result of extinction by a material distributed within or around the narrow - line region , rather than on the scale of the galaxy ( e.g. , the disk of the edge - on galaxy ) . if the large balmer decrement is the result of reddening , and we assume that the intrinsic ratio of h@xmath26 to h@xmath72 is 3.1 , the color excess @xmath84 is required to be 0.82 .",
    "this value corresponds to the column density to the narrow - line region of @xmath85  @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath86 color in a @xmath87 aperture centered on galaxy  a is @xmath88 mag , which is redder than those of normal elliptical galaxies ( @xmath89 mag , @xcite , @xcite ) . if the intrinsic bulge color is the same as a typical color of an elliptical galaxy , the color excess of the bulge @xmath90 is 0.28 , if we adopt the relation @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value is smaller than that to the narrow - line region .",
    "thus the difference between @xmath84 and @xmath90 suggests that dust could be distributed on the scale of the narrow - line region , and smaller than that of the bulge .      using the photometric results from radio to the x - ray wavelength , we can compare the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxy  a with other type  2 seyferts .",
    "photometric results on the galaxy are summarized in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "[ in the infrared we use an upper limit from the _ iras _ faint source catalog ( @xcite ) in the region containing galaxy  a ] .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the sed of galaxy  a as well as those of type  2 seyferts taken from mas - hesse et al .",
    "the seds are normalized such that they have the same flux density as galaxy  a at the optical wavelength ( @xmath7 _ b _ band ) .",
    "since the logarithmic flux density ratio between radio ( 1.4 ghz ) and optical ( @xmath36 band ) is @xmath92 , which is similar to the other radio - quiet type  2 seyferts , galaxy  a is a radio - quiet object .",
    "the flux density in the hard x - ray band is located within a scatter of other type 2 seyferts , galaxy  a has a typical value of the flux density ratio of the hard x - ray to optical region as type  2 seyferts .      in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show a wide image of of ax  j131501 + 3141 . around ax  j131501 + 3141 , we can see two other bright galaxies of similar size , one ( galaxy  b ) is located at @xmath93 east , and the other ( galaxy  c ) is located at @xmath94 south - southeast of ax  j131501 + 3141 .",
    "in course of the multi - slit spectroscopy , we also observed these galaxies .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "since galaxy  c has @xmath95 , its closeness to galaxy  a is just a chance projection .",
    "galaxy  b has almost the same redshift ( 0.072 ) as galaxy  a. the velocity difference between galaxy  a and galaxy  b is 90 km  s@xmath5 , and their projected separation is @xmath93 , which corresponds to 124  kpc at @xmath96 .",
    "the magnitudes of galaxy b are @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and its morphology is that of a normal spiral galaxy without any clear distortion .",
    "however , the spectrum of galaxy  b has emission lines which are h  ii - region like ( @xcite ) . the @xmath86 color of its disk is 1.0 mag which is bluer than the disk of galaxy  a. thus these results would indicate enhanced star - formation in the disk of galaxy  b. there is a possibility that the interaction is a driver of both the nuclear activity in galaxy  a , and the enhanced star - formation in the disk of the galaxy  b.",
    "the hardest x - ray source detected in the continuous 7.0  deg@xmath99 area of the lss has been identified with a type  2 seyfert having the column density to the nucleus of @xmath100  @xmath2 in the local universe ( z@xmath1010.1 ) .",
    "surface density of such object is consistent with recent models of the origin of the cxb by e.g. , madau et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and comastri et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as described below .",
    "they propose that type  2 agns are the hard x - ray sources which need to exist to account for the hardness of the spectrum of the cxb , because type  2 agns have harder x - ray spectra than type  1 agns due to the absorption of their soft x - ray photons . in the surveyed area , we have estimated the number density of type  2 agns which have the column density of @xmath102  @xmath2 and x - ray flux larger than @xmath103 @xmath10  in the 210  kev band i.e. , the flux of ax  j131501 + 3141 . according to the model of comastri",
    "et al . ( 1995 ) , the expected number is 1.2 . observed surface number density is one ( ax  j131501 + 3141 ) , if there are no more such objects in the lss region .",
    "in fact , we can not expect the presence of more such objects because of the following two reasons .",
    "1 ) the agns with @xmath102  @xmath2 in the local universe should have very hard x - ray spectra as like the hardest source ; but no such hard source is found in the lss region above @xmath103 @xmath10(@xcite ) .",
    "2 ) high redshift agns with @xmath102  @xmath2 have softer x - ray spectra than the hardest source in the observed frame due to k - correction and may exist in the lss region .",
    "however the probability that such high - z object exists is very low . because the predicted redshift distribution of absorbed agns above @xmath103 @xmath10(210  kev ) is peaked in z@xmath1010.1 and declining with z in z@xmath1040.1 , if we adopt the evolution of x - ray luminosity function for type  1 agns ( @xcite ) and assume the number ratio of type  1 to type  2 agns is constant with z.    in other surveys some hard x - ray sources have been also identified with absorbed agns . in iwasawa",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , a hard x - ray source ( ax  j1749 + 684 ) detected serendipitously was identified with a nearby ( @xmath105 ) obscured agn .",
    "the hard x - ray flux of the object is 9.6 @xmath13 @xmath10 , 2 times brighter than ax  j131501 + 3141 .",
    "a fainter hard x - ray source ( ax  j08494 + 4454 ) with @xmath106 @xmath10 in the 210  kev band , was identified with a type  2 qso at @xmath107 in course of optical follow - up observations of the _ asca _ lynx deep survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "a common feature of these three type  2 agns is that they are hard x - ray sources with radio detections .",
    "the @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) values of these three objects are 0.67 ( ax  j131501 + 3141 ) , 0.67 ( ax  j1749 + 684 ) and 0.60 ( ax  j08494 + 4454 ) .",
    "the agreement of these indices suggests that a hard x - ray survey together with a radio survey is a fairly efficient way to select obscured type  2 agns .",
    "recently , in some optical follow - up programs for the _ rosat _ deep fields , faint x - ray sources have been identified with narrow emission - line galaxies ( nelgs ) such as type  2 seyferts , star - forming galaxies , and liners ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these objects are thought to be possible candidates for hard sources , but their x - ray spectra in the hard band have not been established . with respect to their soft x - rays ,",
    "their 0.52  kev to optical flux ratios are one order of magnitude larger than those of normal galaxies and one order of magnitude smaller than those of qsos ( @xcite ) .",
    "if we use the upper - limit of ax  j131501 + 3141 in the 0.52 kev band , we find that its x - ray to optical flux ratio is more than 10 times smaller than those of typical nelgs , and closer to the normal galaxies ( @xmath110=-1.52 $ ] ) .",
    "thus ax  j131501 + 3141 may be different from the nelgs detected in the _ rosat _ surveys .",
    "however , it is possible that we are seeing the same population of objects at lower redshifts . to establish the nature of the hard x - ray sources , identification of all the x - ray sources detected in the lss",
