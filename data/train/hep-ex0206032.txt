    "it therefore reveals the structure of the photon and is sensitive to its gluon content . at lep  2",
    "energies direct and the single - resolved processes contribute in equal shares to heavy flavour final states .",
    "the charm cross section is about two orders of magnitude larger than the bottom production due to the smaller quark mass and higher electric charge .",
    "the large quark mass allows the production of heavy flavour to be calculated in perturbative qcd , where the resolved part also depends on the assumed gluon density of the photon .",
    "the exclusive charmonium production has a diffractive contribution at low @xmath4 of the vector meson ( pomeron exchange ) and a resolved contribution at high @xmath4 ( gluon exchange ) .",
    "the resolved production of j@xmath1 , when calculated in the nonrelativistic qcd , predicts that the colour - octet contribution dominates .",
    "exclusive charmonia and bottomonia production at lep  2 provides a precise tool to test qcd at low energies .",
    "their two - photon widths and masses are constraint by approaches used in lattice qcd , nonrelativistic qcd and potential models .    in this article",
    "we summarize the progress made with respect to last year  @xcite in heavy flavour production in two - photon collisions at lep  2 : improvements , updates and new results are reviewed",
    ". a recent more general overview on two - photon physics and the interaction of the photon may be found in ref .",
    "all four lep experiments  @xcite have measured the inclusive charm production using all  @xcite or two thirds  @xcite of their lep  2 statistics ( corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath6 ) at energies around @xmath7 with fully reconstructed d@xmath5 mesons in no - tag events .",
    "the d@xmath8 mesons are reconstructed via the decay to d@xmath9 , the mass difference of d@xmath5 and d@xmath10 providing a clear signal with small background ; up to four decay modes of the d@xmath10 are considered .",
    "three experiments  @xcite provide differential distributions in pseudorapidity .",
    "the distributions are found to be flat in this variable , what is in agreement with the expectation for nlo calculations  @xcite in shape , while in normalisation aleph and l3 are in agreement with the massive calculation , the opal data prefer the massless calculation . the distribution in transverse momentum to the beam axis as predicted in nlo calculations in the massive approach agrees with the data ( figure  [ figdstarpt ] ) .",
    "the data are more consistent now as compared to last year s preliminary results  @xcite . a small scatter of the data points in the range @xmath11 is still observed , but is within the given errors .",
    "direct and single - resolved contribution can be separated using the fact that in the resolved one the remnant jet carries away a part of the invariant mass available in the @xmath0 collision .",
    "two variables have been used : 1 ) @xmath12 , which is the ratio of @xmath13 , a measure for the invariant mass of the @xmath14 system , and the visible invariant mass @xmath15 , a measure for the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system ; 2 ) @xmath16 , the minimum of @xmath17 , a measure for the fraction of particles , which do not escape in the remnant jet .",
    "the relative contribution @xmath18 fitted by the three experiments  @xcite are in agreement with the prediction of frixione et al .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath19 ) and among themselves regarding the slightly different acceptance ranges of the experiments .",
    "the l3 collaboration has measured the charm cross section as function of the two - photon centre - of - mass energy  @xcite using the whole lep  2 data sample .",
    "the charm - flavoured quarks are identified by their semi - leptonic decays to electrons .",
    "a parameterization of the form @xmath21 ( pomeron @xmath22 reggeon ) describes the data well .",
    "the pythia monte carlo clearly fails , predicting only @xmath23 of the total cross section .",
    "this may be partially attributed to next - to - leading order corrections , which are not included in pythia .",
    "the pomeron slope fitted from the data is steeper than the rise observed in @xmath24 .",
    "nlo order calculations , but using a rather small charm quark mass of @xmath25 , are in very good agreement with the data .",
    "this also indicates that the resolved contribution , the gluon content of the photon , which dominates at high @xmath20 , is needed to explain the data .      extrapolated to the full phase space , the measurements using the d@xmath5 as the charm tag , can be compared to qcd  @xcite and other measurements  @xcite , see figure  [ figcc ] .",
    "all data are consistent .",
    "if only the direct contribution would be considered the prediction at lep  2 would be lower by a factor two .",
    "it should be noted that for the measurements with leptonic final state a light charm quark mass is slightly preferred .",
    "= 1.00=1.00    = 1.00=1.01      when one of the scattered beam particles is detected , the event can be used to determine the charm structure function @xmath27 . with 60 such single - tagged events with a @xmath28 meson from the full lep  2 statistics ,",
    "the opal collaboration performed a first measurement in two bins of @xmath29 with @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a general overview on photon structure functions . )",
    "the comparison with the calculations shows that a point - like contribution is not sufficient to describe the data .",
    "a hadron - like part is needed .",
    "the data even exceed the models , though the measurement errors are still too large to be conclusive .",
    "while writing this article , opal submitted their result  @xcite for publication now with a fitted number of 55 @xmath28 mesons , reducing somewhat the discrepancy between data and the calculations at low @xmath29 .",
    "open bottom production is measured by the l3 and the opal collaborations  @xcite at lep  2 energies using an integrated luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "their analysis procedures exploit the fact , that the momentum as well as the transverse momentum of leptons with respect to the closest jet is higher for muons and electrons from bottom than from background , which is mainly charm .",
    "therefore , leptons with momenta of more than @xmath32 are selected and their momentum distribution with respect to the closest jet ( obtained with the jade jet - algorithm in l3 and ktclus in opal , while in both experiments the lepton was excluded , when defining the jet ) is investigated .",
    "similar to the studies in charm production , the bottom quarks produced in direct and single resolved events show a different behaviour in the transverse momentum distribution .",
    "the variable @xmath33 is well suited to demonstrate the need for both contributions : the single resolved part at low @xmath34 and the direct part at high @xmath34 .",
    "the agreement between data and monte carlo simulation is very good .",
    "the total cross section measurements for open bottom production are summarized in figure  [ figbb ] .",
    "the results are compared to nlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the calculations underestimate the data by a factor three corresponding to three to four standard deviations .",

    "a clean signal of @xmath35 events for @xmath36j@xmath37x is seen , where the j@xmath1 decays to a muon pair and where x denotes at least two tracks seen in the detector . from a fit of the direct and resolved contribution , as taken from the pythia simulation , a value of @xmath38 is extracted to originate from the resolved process : a clear indication for the gluon in the photon . in a recent paper",
    "the octet production of j@xmath1 in association with jets has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the singlet production is not sufficient in order to describe the data , but that the octet production is needed for an agreement with the delphi measurements .",

    "for the other three a two - photon width is obtained somewhat higher than the world averages  @xcite and recent measurements at lep and other colliders  @xcite .      as reported at last year s dis conference in bologna  @xcite ,",
    "the aleph experiment has started a search for the still undiscovered @xmath3 pseudoscalar meson ( see figure  [ figetab ] for a candidate event ) .",
    "the search has recently been published  @xcite ; a preliminary result of a search has now also been reported by l3  @xcite .",
    "various predictions exist for the mass of the @xmath3 , e.g. , from potential models , pqcd , nrqcd , and lattice calculations .",
    "while the production can reliably be estimated the branching ratios of the meson have to be guessed .",
    "an estimate based on mlla combined with lphd and using isospin invariance has been proposed  @xcite and used by aleph .",
    "the efficiencies for the decay modes of the @xmath3 under study by aleph ( four charged particles ; or six charged particles ) and l3 ( two charged particle plus neutral pion or eta ; or four charged particles ; or six charged particles ) are around 13% and 4% , respectively .",
    "the experiments would expect about one to two events .",
    "the background is estimated to be about one event .",
    "aleph observes one , l3 observes three events in the signal region from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",

    "we summarized the investigations of heavy flavour production in two - photon collisions at lep .",
    "the inclusive charm production has been studied and qcd predictions and experiment are found in agreement for differential distributions such as in pseudorapidity and transverse momentum and total cross section .",
    "the dependence on @xmath20 is reproduced by qcd , which requires gluon in the photon .",
    "this is also proven by the explicit measurement of the fraction of direct an resolved contribution in no - tag events .",
    "the charm structure function @xmath55 shows some deviations , but more statistics is needed .",
    "newer measurements on inclusive charmonia clearly show that the colour octet production is needed . while most measurements of exclusive charmonia are in agreement with the world averages some inconstistencies arose , such as in the decay of the @xmath2 to four charged pions .",
