    "the determination of the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam is one of the dominant systematic uncertainties in any parity violating electron scattering ( pves ) experiment . in order to achieve the desired high precision , the polarization of the electron beam",
    "must be monitored continuously with an uncertainty of @xmath00.5% .",
    "these ambitious goals can be achieved if multiple independent and high precision polarimeters are used simultaneously .",
    "in addition to being precise , the polarimeters must be non - invasive and must achieve the desired statistical precision in the shortest time possible .",
    "compton and mller polarimeters are typically the polarimeters of choice for these experiments and are essential to achieve the desired precision .",
    "however , a complimentary polarimetry technique based on the spin dependence of synchrotron radiation , referred to as `` spin - light , '' can be used as a relative polarimeter .",
    "a spin - light polarimeter could provide additional means for improving the systematic uncertainties and when calibrated against a compton / mller polarimeter it could provide a stable continuous monitoring of the beam polarization .",
    "we develop the conceptual design for a continuous polarimeter based on `` spin - light '' .",
    "the proposed spin - light polarimeter can achieve statistical precision of @xmath0 1% in measurement cycles of less than 10 minutes for 4 - 20 gev electron beams with a beam currents of @xmath1 100 @xmath2a .",
    ".a comparison of the compton , mller and spin - light polarimeters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "spin light based polarimetry was demonstrated over 30 years ago , but has been ignored since then .",
    "a spin - light polarimeter has several advantages over conventional polarimeters and when used in conjunction with a compton polarimeter it could help provide a new benchmark for precision polarimetry",
    ". the 11 gev beam at jlab or the electron beam at a future eic would be well suited for spin light polarimetry and such a polarimeter would help achieve the @xmath0 0.5 % polarimetry desired by experiments approved for the 12 gev era and proposed for the eic . a 3 pole wiggler with a field strength of 4  t and a pole length of 10  cm would be adequate for such a polarimeter .",
    "a dual position sensitive ionization chambers with split anode plates is ideally suited as the x - ray detector for such a polarimeter .",
    "the differential detector design would help reduce systematic uncertainties .",
