    "nonequilibrium ( neq ) fluctuation has been an important issue in the field of statistical mechanics for the last two decades since the first discovery of the fluctuation theorem for the entropy production  @xcite .",
    "fluctuation theorems ( ft s )  @xcite and the jarzynski equality ( je )  @xcite are the central theoretical relations governing neq fluctuation phenomena , widely valid for many neq systems , deterministic or stochastic , thermostatted with heat baths",
    ". it basically deals with a large fluctuation around the average measurement in theory and experiment with considerable contribution from rare events .",
    "such phenomena become dominant for a system with small degrees of freedom .",
    "there have been extensive studies of small experimental systems such as a microscopic bead dragging in a viscous fluid  @xcite , a single molecule of the rna under mechanical stretch  @xcite , an oscillating bead under the translating center of the optical trap  @xcite , the circuit of an electric dipole in electric potential bias  @xcite , an ultra light metallic wire under torsion  @xcite , etc .",
    "external bias was considered as a typical underlying mechanism for neq systems such as the nano circuit device with potential bias  @xcite , the harmonic oscillator under constant torque applied  @xcite , one dimensional lattice gas in contact at boundaries with different heat or particle baths  @xcite .",
    "a nonconservative force was also recognized as a source for the entropy production  @xcite such as in a nano heat engine in contact with multiple reservoirs for a circulating current in high dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "non - markovian nature caused by memory effect or colored noise is another source for neq  @xcite . in these examples ,",
    "the system reaches a neq steady state ( ness ) after a transient period , where a persistent nonzero current , directed or circulated , generates the incessant work production .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the work production exhibits an exponential decay with a power - law prefactor in the rare - event region  @xcite , along with interesting unusual features such as initial condition dependency of the large deviation function  @xcite and multiple dynamic transitions in reaching the ness  @xcite . on the other hand , a time - dependent perturbation on external parameters such as electric field , magnetic field , volume , force constant , etc",
    ".  generates a genuine time - dependent neq state where the system never maintains the ness . for example , the stochastic motion of a brownian particle was studied in the harmonic potential moving with a constant velocity ( _ sliding _ parabola potential )  @xcite , and also in the harmonic potential with a time - dependent force constant ( _ breathing _ parabola potential )  @xcite . in these cases , the work pdf also shows an exponential decay with a power - law prefactor in the rare - event region , along with a time - dependent characteristic value for the work production determining the exponential decay shape .",
    "most of previous studies considered the overdamped limit , partly because the experimental situation for a colloidal particle in a harmonic trap can be well approximated in the overdamped limit and also partly because the analytical treatment is much easier  @xcite .    in this paper , we generalize these results beyond the overdamped limit ( _ underdamped _ case ) for a brownian particle in a breathing parabola potential with the momentum variable kept intact .",
    "we focus on the inertial effect on the time - dependent characteristic value for the work production .",
    "our model may also serve as a soft - wall version of the box expansion or compression with a single brownian particle inside , in contact with a thermal reservoir  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is also feasible : in a molecular tweezer or an optical trap experiment , the potential well can be approximated by the harmonic potential .",
    "the shape of the potential well , so the force constant of the harmonic potential is set to vary with a time - dependent external field .    the stochastic motion is described by the langevin equation and the corresponding fokker - planck ( kramers ) equation .",
    "we use the path integral formalism to derive rigorous relations from which the time - dependent work pdf can be easily calculated with machine accuracy and also its cumulants at all temperatures with any time - dependent force constant .",
    "we find an interesting oscillatory feature of the work pdf shape , solely due to the inertial effect ( absent in the overdamped limit ) , which resembles multiple dynamic transitions found in the linear diffusion system  @xcite , but shows smooth crossovers rather than sharp transitions .",
    "thus we call this crossover as a _ pseudo _ locking - unlocking transition .",
    "the existence of multiple pseudo dynamic transitions may be related to the existence of the phase - space circulating current in the underdamped case , but full intuitive understanding calls for further investigation in future .    in section  [ harmonic ] ,",
    "we introduce the breathing harmonic potential function and discuss the ft s . in section  [ sec : path - integral ] , we derive the equations for the pdf and the cumulants for the work production using the path integral formalism .",
    "our formalism is tested for the systems in the sudden change limit . in section",
    "[ numerical ] , we present the analysis for the work pdf and find the exponential tail with a power - law prefactor . in section  [ simple ] , we study the overdamped limit for exactly solvable cases . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the main results of our work and the perspective to future works .",
    "we consider the brownian motion of a particle in one dimension under the breathing harmonic potential with a time - dependent force constant @xmath0 and in contact with a heat bath .",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a damping coefficient and @xmath3 is white noise with zero mean satisfying @xmath4 .",

    "then it satisfies the fokker - planck equation , specially called the kramers equation , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the diffusion matrix is given by @xmath23 where a small positive parameter @xmath24 is introduced for convenience , making possible the inversion of the diffusion matrix @xmath25 during a formal manipulation in the path integral formulation . in the end",
