    "one of the most important missions of the b factories is to carry out precision tests of the standard model . among the key predictions",
    "is that the cabibbo kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is unitary  @xcite .",
    "this fact is most elegantly expressed by the closing of the unitarity triangle .",
    "cp violation in @xmath4 decays allow the separate measurement of the three angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the most successful such measurement to date  @xcite is the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "a crucial point to note is that this result is subject to no significant theoretical error so the precision will improve with more data .    in this talk",
    "i will consider the determination of @xmath0 which has the same property , that there is little theoretical error .",
    "the basic idea  @xcite is to interfere the quark level process @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "of course this interference can only take place if the final states are the same which can be achieved in the decay @xmath1 interfering with @xmath8 through decays of @xmath2 , @xmath9 to a common final state .",
    "two classes of final states are of particular interest .",
    "first of all , there are states which are cp eigenstates  @xcite ( cpes ) such as @xmath10 .",
    "second of all , there are @xmath2 decay  @xcite which are doubly cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) such as @xmath11 . in addition",
    ", recent work  @xcite has also considered in this context final states which are singly cabibbo suppressed but not cp eigenstates such as @xmath12 . in this",
    "talk i will focus on cpes and dcs final states .",
    "for a given final state @xmath13 , let us denote by @xmath14 the combined branching ratio @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 the combined branching ratio @xmath17 $ ] ( here @xmath2 represents a generic mixture of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the branching ratio of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the branching ratio of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the branching ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath26 is the branching ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath27 is the strong phase difference between @xmath1 while @xmath28 is the strong phase difference between @xmath22 and @xmath29 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath30 mixing is small  @xcite    this formalism , however , applies only to cases where the final state of the @xmath2 decay is an exclusive state controlled by a single amplitude .",
    "this is the situation if the @xmath2 decays to a two body final state with a single helicity amplitude ( e.g. @xmath11 ) but will not be true for decays to 3 or more final state particles . in such multi - body decay",
    "each point in phase space behaves like an exclusive state but the integrated rate over phase space we will regard as an inclusive state .",
    "likewise we can regard the combination of states with different particle content as inclusive states .",
    "in the following we will develop the formalism for such inclusive states analogous to eqn .",
    "( [ exclusive_d ] ) .",
    "this will allow for a strategy to improve the determination of @xmath0 with the addition of information from a @xmath3 charm factory such as cleo - c .",
    "the improvement results primarily from the improved statistics which are obtained from the use of inclusive states where the charm factory provides key information needed to interpret that data .",
    "let us consider @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "each of the states @xmath32 in @xmath33 satisfies eqn .",
    "( [ exclusive_d ] ) . summing over @xmath34",
    ", we obtain  @xcite :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined by :    @xmath38    we can regard @xmath37 as the average strong phase of the inclusive set of states , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 as the coherence of this set of states .    comparing eqn .",
    "( [ inclusive_d ] ) with eqn .",
    "( [ exclusive_d ] ) we see that the cross section for inclusive states requires an additional parameter , @xmath36 , as compared to the case of an exclusive state .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the diagrams in fig .",
    "( [ atwood_fig1 ] ) where we show the geometric relation between the amplitudes of the two channels as vectors in the complex plane . in the exclusive case",
    "we take the phase convention that the amplitude via the @xmath39 channel is real while the @xmath40 channel has a combination of strong and weak phases . the vector representing the @xmath40 channel thus swings through @xmath41 when moving from the @xmath42 to the corresponding @xmath43 decay . in the inclusive case ,",
    "the second leg of each triangle opens up into a cone of angle @xmath44 because of the incoherence of the strong phases . from this",
    "it can be clearly seen that if @xmath45 then the situation reduces to the exclusive case while if @xmath46 the there is no cp violation .    to    as was pointed out by  @xcite , that if you know @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 you can reconstruct the diagram ( up to discrete ambiguities ) and thus determine @xmath0 .",
    "in the exclusive case , however , you would also have to know @xmath36 .",
    "even with exclusive states , this approach may not be practical because the determination of the small branching ratio @xmath8 is difficult  @xcite .",
    "this can be circumvented if two distinct exclusive states are used since then one does have enough information to solve for all the strong phases and @xmath0 .",
    "this fails in the case of inclusive states due to the extra parameter , @xmath36 .    at a @xmath3 charm factory",
    "@xcite it is possible to determine @xmath28 for an exclusive state  @xcite and @xmath49 and @xmath36 for an inclusive final state  @xcite .",
    "this is because the decay @xmath50 leaves the final state @xmath2 s in an anti - symmetric flavor state therefore if one of the @xmath51-mesons decays to an inclusive state @xmath33 and the other to state @xmath52 , the correlated rate  @xcite ( again , assuming @xmath51 mixing is small  @xcite ) is :    @xmath53 \\label{fg } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath52 is a cpes with cp eigenvalue @xmath55 , then this reduces to :    @xmath56    \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{fcp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and if @xmath57 then    @xmath58    note in this latter case that if @xmath45 then @xmath59 by bose symmetry .",
    "thus , let us suppose that @xmath60 distinct inclusive states as well as cp eigenstates are considered and all correlations are measured at a @xmath3 charm factory .",
    "the number of unknown parameters is @xmath61 because there is @xmath36 and @xmath62 for each of the inclusive states . the number of correlations which can be measured is @xmath63 as follows :    1 .",
    "each state can be correlated with any other state including itself giving @xmath64 observables .",
    "each state can be correlated with the charge conjugate of any other state including itself giving @xmath64 observables .",
    "each state can be correlated with a cpes giving @xmath60 observables .",
    "there are therefore @xmath65 more observables than parameters .",
    "the same is also true if some of states are exclusive since an exclusive state has only one parameter ( @xmath66 ) but the branching ratio @xmath67 is also automatically 0 by bose symmetry so there is also one less observable .",
    "let us now consider some examples to illustrate how various combinations of final states can be taken together to determine @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , let us consider two exclusive final states @xmath68 and @xmath69 as well as cp=-1 eigenstates .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath70  @xcite while @xmath71  @xcite ; @xmath72 while @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "note @xmath74 is not yet measured so we estimate it by multiplying @xmath75 by @xmath76 . for illustrative purposes , we will take the ad - hoc values @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we will take the branching ratio of @xmath79 states to be @xmath80 , roughly the rate of @xmath2 2 body decays to @xmath81 and a pseudo - scalar or vector .    to    in fig .",
    "( [ atwood_fig2 ] ) we show the minimum value of @xmath82 at each possible value of @xmath49 for each of the two exclusives states were we use the 6 possible correlations as discussed above ( i.e. @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . to calculate @xmath82 we take @xmath89 .",
    "probably @xmath90 would roughly correspond to reasonable @xmath91 errors form cleo - c .",
    "let us now see how well this can be used to determine @xmath0 . for the purpose of illustration , we will assume that @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which is consistent with the current ckm fits  @xcite .    to    in fig .",
    "( [ atwood_fig3 ] ) we show the minimum @xmath82 as a function of @xmath0 for a number of combinations of the data sets assuming @xmath94 .",
    "notice that the curves are symmetric with respect to @xmath95 as well as @xmath96 therefore there is ultimately a 4-fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath0 through this method .",
    "the dotted curve shows the results where we just use @xmath14 and @xmath16 for both @xmath69 and @xmath79 .",
    "notice that the curve is pulled to 0 at a number of points due to the discrete ambiguities of the solution in this case because the four observables @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 are determined by the four unknowns @xmath26 , @xmath0 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "if we add another mode , @xmath103 as is shown by the solid curve , the situation is improved since this adds two more observables , @xmath104 and @xmath105 but only one more unknown , @xmath106 .",
    "clearly the ambiguities are largely lifted in fact . finally , if we fit the b factory data jointly with the @xmath3 data discussed above we obtain the dash dotted curve where the parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 are , in effect , determined from independently .",
    "looking at the @xmath91 errors of @xmath0 estimated by taking the intersection for the curve with @xmath109 , we see that for the case of @xmath110 and @xmath79 , the error is @xmath111 ( although there is additional confusion due to the multiple minima of the curve ) ; for the case if @xmath110 , @xmath112 and @xmath79 the error is @xmath113 and for @xmath110 , @xmath112 and @xmath79 with charm factory data the error is @xmath114 . in the last case",
    "the curve also smoothly funnels down to the correct value of @xmath0 indicating that the convergence will scale well as data is improved .    to    let us turn our attention now to the an inclusive case where we consider decays of the form @xmath115",
    "we will model this set of states using the model discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we shall also consider breaking down this set according to the energy of the @xmath116 where @xmath117 has @xmath118 , @xmath119 has @xmath120 and @xmath121 has @xmath122 . in this model , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , while @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "if we fit @xmath0 using @xmath14 and @xmath16 for @xmath131 and @xmath79 together with charm factory data determining @xmath132 and @xmath37 we obtain the solid curve in fig .",
    "( [ atwood_fig4 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath91 error in @xmath0 is @xmath133 . if , however , we take the exact same data except we break @xmath131 down into @xmath134 we obtain the dashed curve in fig .",
    "( [ atwood_fig4 ] ) with the corresponding error of @xmath135 .",
    "the improvement is due to the fact that in breaking down the data we have increased the number of constraints compared to the number of unknown parameters .",
    "of course the statistical errors on each of the @xmath14 and @xmath136 s in the latter case will be larger .",
    "the improvement of the latter case with respect to the exclusive states is largely due to the fact that we have larger statistics overall .",
    "clearly , as discussed in  @xcite , it is important to consider different strategies for breaking down inclusive data in order to obtain the best determination of @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , i have shown how the strong phase properties of an inclusive decay of @xmath2 may be represented by two parameters , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . correlated",
    "decays in a @xmath3 charm factory provide a means of obtaining these parameters .",
    "this information may be put to good use in obtaining the ckm phase @xmath0 via @xmath1 so that a @xmath3 charm factory will proved invaluable information to interpret this data from @xmath4 factories .",
