    "recently , various four - dimensional models embedded in higher dimensional spacetime have been greatly investigated @xcite .",
    "their spectra generally include kaluza  klein ( kk ) states , which carry nonzero momentum in extra - dimensions . as an example , let us consider a circle compactification of five - dimensional gauge theory with a massless matter field .",
    "the effective four - dimensional theory has a tower of kk modes of the gauge field , say @xmath5 , and that of the matter field , say @xmath6 , where @xmath7 runs over the integers and @xmath8 runs over @xmath9 .",
    "the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 carry fifth dimensional momentum , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the compactification radius",
    ". then @xmath5 and @xmath6 with nonzero @xmath7 are kk states . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the stability of kk states .",
    "a state @xmath12 is kinematically unstable and decays into states @xmath13 and @xmath14 when the charges are conserved in the process and their masses satisfy the inequality @xmath15 . in the case of the five - dimensional model above , masses of @xmath16 and @xmath6",
    "are classically @xmath17 .",
    "thus for @xmath18 , @xmath16 can decay to @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath6 can decay to @xmath19 and @xmath21 .",
    "similar decay processes occur for @xmath22 . from these",
    ", we see that the stable kk states are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this result is supported by perturbative analysis in @xcite , where the inequality of masses in various models are evaluated under the one - loop correction . on the other hand , nonperturbative behavior of the kk spectrum",
    "was found in the strong coupling limit of a supersymmetric extension of the model @xcite . in @xcite , the kk spectrum of a circle compactification of the five - dimensional @xmath25 supersymmetric model with gauge group @xmath1 and @xmath26 massless fundamental matter fields",
    "was studied in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the four - dimensional effective theory possesses @xmath25 supersymmetry , so that the exact mass formula is derived by using seiberg ",
    "witten theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , the theory has the d3-brane probe realization @xcite , where the inequality is diagammatically evaluated by using string junctions @xcite . by using these techniques",
    ", it was shown that @xmath16 can decay to @xmath19 and @xmath20 similar to the perturbative result , while @xmath27 decays easier than @xmath6 in a certain region of vacuum moduli space .",
    "now we know that the perturbative kk spectrum is different from the spectrum in the strong coupling limit",
    ". how does the spectrum change as the five - dimensional coupling constant @xmath2 varies from 0 to @xmath28 ? to answer the question , we shall generalize the analysis in @xcite to the case with finite @xmath2 .",
    "in section 2 , we derive the exact mass formula for finite @xmath2 , using seiberg  witten theory . from the mass formula and the d3-brane probe realization ,",
    "we determine the stability of kk modes in section 3 . as a result",
    ", we show that the nonperturbative behavior also appears in the case of the finite coupling constant .",
    "as we decrease @xmath2 , the region where the nonperturbative behavior appears becomes small .",
    "as we take the limit @xmath3 , the region disappears and the perturbative spectrum is reproduced .",
    "five - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory compactified on a circle is effectively described by four - dimensional @xmath25 supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "it includes an adjoint complex higgs scalar field @xmath29 as a superpartner of the gauge field , and has a vacuum moduli space parametrized by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath29 .",
    "the low energy effective lagrangian and the mass formula are derived from a seiberg ",
    "witten curve @xcite .",
    "for the theory with gauge group @xmath1 and @xmath30 matter fields in the fundamental representation , which we refer to as quarks , the seiberg ",
    "witten curve is written as @xcite @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , a gauge invariant moduli parameter , which takes a value on @xmath34 .",
    "constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on the parameters of the theory such as the five - dimensional coupling constant @xmath2 , the compactification radius @xmath11 , and masses of the matter fields @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . in this subsection , we shall determine these constants . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "the zero points of the discriminant of , @xmath42 are determined from global symmetry @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between global symmetry and zeros of @xmath43 is listed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since our model has the flavor symmetry @xmath44 , we obtain that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are to be vanished and @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the symmetry is extended to broken affine @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this is because the states carry not only @xmath44 charges but also the kk charge @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "an @xmath44 multiplet has copies labeled by an integer @xmath7 .",
    "this is just the structure of affine @xmath44 multiplets .",
    "the affine symmetry is broken at the scale @xmath48 because the copies have different masses .",
    "the broken affine symmetry requires two additional zero points @xcite . from these restrictions",
    ", we conclude that the curve of our model is @xmath49 to simplify the curve , we scale and shift the variables as @xmath50 and set @xmath51 and @xmath52 . then we obtain a simple form , @xmath53 then the discriminant is given by @xmath54    next we consider the constants @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "they are functions of @xmath2 and @xmath11 . in the following ,",
    "we derive explicit forms of the functions by matching the curve with that of two limits .",
    "we choose @xmath58 and @xmath11 as a set of independent variables , and complexify @xmath58 to @xmath59 , the bare coupling constant of four - dimensional effective theory .",
    "firstly , we consider a limit @xmath60 with fixed @xmath61 . in this limit ,",
    "the theory is reduced to four - dimensional @xmath25 @xmath1 gauge theory with @xmath39 massless quarks , and the coupling constant @xmath61 .",
    "its seiberg  witten curve is known as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the eisenstein series : @xmath65 the mass dimensions of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 in are 3 , 2 and 2 , respectively . setting the same in , we find that the mass dimensions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are 0 and that of @xmath57 is 1 .",
    "hence @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend only on @xmath61 and then @xmath57 is written as @xmath48 times a function of @xmath61 , say @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath69 is removed from the curve by scaling parameters as @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . altogether rearranging the curve yields the following equation : @xmath73 now we take the limit @xmath60 in and compare with . as we shift @xmath67 as @xmath74 in , we see that @xmath75 here @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) are the solutions of the equation @xmath78 . they are written as @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are @xmath82    secondly , we consider the limit @xmath83 with zero @xmath84-angle and fixed @xmath11 . in this limit , flavor symmetry @xmath44",
    "is enhanced to @xmath85 @xcite and the curve should be @xcite @xmath86 now we take the limit in the curve . from , , and the relations @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we see that @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the limit .",
    "thus @xmath93 and @xmath94 when @xmath41 in and is @xmath95 or @xmath96 , while @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath99 . in the former case",
    ", we can not make coincide with . in the latter case ,",
    "we make it by scaling parameters as @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ". then we choose @xmath99 in and .",
    "thus we have @xmath103    in summary , the seiberg ",
    "witten curve of our model is , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by and .",
    "its discriminant is with @xmath104 .",
    "the zero points of @xmath105 are located at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it is known that extra massless states appear at each zero point @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath108 in the following .      from the seiberg ",
    "witten curve , we shall derive the mass formula of stable states called bps states . for this purpose",
    ", we derive the periods of the curve , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the homology cycles on the torus given by with a fixed @xmath68 .",
    "the periods @xmath112 are determined from the picard ",
    "fuchs equation , @xmath113 as we set @xmath114 with @xmath115 , the equation becomes @xmath116 this is the standard hypergeometric equation of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "it has two independent solutions , @xmath119 series expansions of @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are easily derived .",
    "for instance , the expansions for @xmath125 are @xmath126 the periods are given by linear combinations of the functions , @xmath127 coefficients @xmath128 are determined by direct calculation of elliptic integrals for @xmath125 and comparing the result with the expansions and .",
    "indeed we have @xmath129    the periods undergo monodromy around zeros of @xmath43 .",
    "the monodromy matrices acting on @xmath112 around @xmath106 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are @xmath132 respectively . from these matrices",
    ", we can determine what kind of states becomes massless at the zeros ; when the monodromy matrix around a first order zero is @xmath133 a state @xmath134 , whose electric and magnetic charges of unbroken @xmath135 gauge symmetry are @xmath136 and @xmath137 respectively , becomes massless .",
    "thus we see that @xmath138 becomes massless at @xmath139 and @xmath140 at @xmath141 . moreover , six states become massless simultaneously at @xmath106 , the sixth order zero .",
    "since @xmath142 is expressed as @xmath143 , the massless states are @xmath138 , @xmath140 and four @xmath144 .",
    "now we can write down the mass formula .",
    "it is described by the integration of the periods by @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "each bound of the integrals is decided in order to reproduce the extra massless states at the zero points correctly .",
    "then the mass formula of a state with the electric and magnetic charges @xmath134 and the charges of broken affine symmetry related to the singularities at @xmath145 , say @xmath146 and @xmath147 , is given by @xmath148 where @xmath149 in the following , we evaluate the values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 by means of the numerical integration on _",
    "mathmatica_. for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath84-angle is zero . then @xmath55 and @xmath56 are real , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . hence the zeros of @xmath43 , @xmath106 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , are aligned from the left on the real axis of the @xmath68-plane .",
    "we set the branch cuts of @xmath151 and @xmath150 from these zeros to @xmath28 along the real axis as depicted in fig.[setup ] .",
    "when we cross each cut from the lower half @xmath68-plane , + @xmath154 is changed by the matrices @xmath155 for the cut from @xmath106 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively . to conserve , we should change the charges @xmath156 simultaneously .",
    "the matrices acting on @xmath156 are given by @xmath157",
    "four - dimensional theory described by a seiberg  witten curve appears in type iib string theory as the world volume theory of a d3-brane probe in a 7-brane background @xcite . for our model",
    ", we employ the background constructed from six 7-branes @xmath158 ^ 4[2,-1][1,0]$ ] at @xmath159 , a 7-brane @xmath160 $ ] at @xmath161 , and a 7-brane @xmath162 $ ] at @xmath163 . here",
    "@xmath164 is a complex coordinate of the space transverse to the 7-branes , @xmath158 $ ] denotes a d7-brane , and @xmath165 $ ] denotes an @xmath166-dual 7-brane @xcite .",
    "the metric on the @xmath164-plane is given by @xcite @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "in this background , the world volume theory of a d3-brane probe located at @xmath169 is our model with the moduli parameter @xmath68 .",
    "states of the model correspond to strings ending on the d3-brane .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of states corresponds to the spectrum of strings which can end on the d3-brane probe . then to find the spectrum of kk modes , we study the spectrum of corresponding strings .    in iib string theory",
    ", there appear a fundamental string , @xmath144 , and its @xmath166-dual strings , @xmath134 .",
    "a string @xmath134 has its ends on a d3-brane or a 7-brane with the same charges , @xmath165 $ ] .",
    "in addition , strings can merge each other and make a string junction @xcite .",
    "thus there are three kinds of strings ending on the d3-brane probe : a string connecting a 7-brane and the d3-brane , a string with the both ends on the d3-brane , and a string emanating from a string junction and ending on the d3-brane .",
    "some strings are related to string junctions transitionally , due to the string creation at 7-branes @xcite . in any case , a string @xmath134 ending on the d3-brane is detected as a state with the electric charge @xmath136 and the magnetic charge @xmath137 .",
    "especially , a string @xmath144 connecting @xmath158 $ ] at @xmath170 and the d3-brane corresponds to a quark , and a string @xmath144 with the both ends on the d3-brane corresponds to a gauge field .",
    "the winding number of a string around the 7-branes is equivalent to the kk charge @xmath7 @xcite .    to be stable",
    ", a string stretches along a geodesic that minimizes the string mass .",
    "the mass of a string @xmath134 along a curve @xmath14 is given by @xmath171 where @xmath172 , the tension of @xmath134 @xcite . in order to minimize this ,",
    "points on a geodesic emanating from @xmath173 satisfy the equation @xmath174 here @xmath29 is a constant between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "it takes the same value for geodesics of the strings in a stable junction @xcite .",
    "then , the mass of a string junction constructed from @xmath177 from @xmath161 , @xmath178 from @xmath163 , @xmath179 from @xmath159 and an outgoing string @xmath134 coincides with when the outgoing string ends on the d3-brane at @xmath180 .",
    "thus the junction corresponds to a state with the charges @xmath181 .",
    "note that the geodesic equation of the outgoing string @xmath134 is rewritten as @xmath182 hereinafter , we refer to the string obeying as @xmath181 . when a string @xmath181 crosses branch cuts , it undergoes monodromy described by the matrices .",
    "let us notice that @xmath29 parameterizes the direction of geodesics .",
    "as @xmath29 varies , the geodesic moves around the point @xmath173 and sweeps some region in the @xmath164-plane .",
    "when the region includes a point @xmath180 , the string can end on the d3-brane probe at @xmath180 and is detected as a stable state .",
    "therefore , the region in the @xmath164-plane through which the geodesic of a string passes corresponds to the region in the moduli @xmath68-plane where the corresponding state is stable @xcite .",
    "then in the following , we seek the regions of kk modes of quarks @xmath6 , unbroken @xmath135 gauge fields @xmath5 and @xmath183-bosons @xmath184 by evaluating and for corresponding strings . in the following ,",
    "we assume @xmath185 and @xmath186 unless we explicitly state otherwise",
    ".     sweeps out whole of the @xmath164-plane .",
    "this result means that @xmath187 exists stably for any value of the moduli parameter @xmath68 . ]",
    "[ [ quarks ] ] quarks + + + + + +    we now consider the cases of quarks .",
    "first of all we consider @xmath187 .",
    "it corresponds to a string @xmath144 emanating from @xmath159 , that is , @xmath188 . the geodesics for various @xmath29 are evaluated as depicted in fig.[groundstates ] . from the figure",
    ", we see that the string sweeps all the @xmath164-plane .",
    "thus we can conclude that @xmath187 is stable for all the moduli @xmath68-plane .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , we consider @xmath5 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a string @xmath144 going around the 7-branes @xmath7 times .",
    "the string corresponds to @xmath7 loop strings or loop string junctions derived for @xmath189 .",
    "thus @xmath5 can decay into @xmath7 @xmath189 for any value of @xmath68 .",
    "similary , one can derive that @xmath190 is stable for all the @xmath68-plane but the segment and @xmath191 ( @xmath18 ) can decay into @xmath7 @xmath190 .",
