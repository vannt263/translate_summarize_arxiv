    "the magnetization dynamics of ultra - thin magnetic layers ( @xmath310 nm ) is of great scientific and technological interest , as such layers are widely used in spin - injection and transport studies as well as in magnetic devices .",
    "there has been particular interest in non - local effects whereby layers separated from a magnetic layer influence its magnetization dynamics through non - magnetic ( nm ) metallic contact layers , i.e. , via conduction electrons . such effects were modeled and studied in the early 1970 s by silsbee _",

    "calculations @xcite as well as transport experiments @xcite .",
    "the current interest in this mechanism is at least threefold .",
    "first , it is a fundamental mechanism of damping that can provide important information on interface and bulk spin diffusion .",
    "second , the effect is known to play an important role in current - induced magnetization excitations in spin - transfer devices @xcite . in such devices",
    ", a few nanometer thick magnetic layer is embedded between nm layers which separate it from a thick ferromagnetic layer that sets the spin - polarization of the current @xcite .",
    "the threshold current density for magnetic excitations is proportional to the damping @xcite . in order to understand the physics of spin transfer",
    ", it is therefore important to investigate the effect of adjacent nm layers on the magnetic relaxation of ultra - thin films .",
    "finally , from a technological point of view , this process provides a way to engineer the damping , which is important for high speed magneto - electronic devices .",
    "mizukami _ et al .",
    "_ studied the gilbert damping of sputtered nm@xmath1 py@xmath2 nm films as a function of the fm layer thickness ( @xmath4 nm ) and for different adjacent non - magnetic metals nm = cu , pd and pt using a x - band fmr technique @xcite .",
    "the damping was found to be consistent with the spin pumping picture : increasing with decreasing py thickness for the films with nm = pt and pd only .",
    "further , the magnetization damping of cu@xmath2py@xmath5 cu@xmath2pt structures as a function of cu layer thickness @xmath6 and with fixed py thickness , showed evidence for a non - local effect .",
    "however , the non - local damping has been studied mainly in nm@xmath1 fm@xmath2 nm structures as a function of the fm layer thickness and varying the material directly in contact with the fm layer @xcite .",
    "there have also been no experimental studies of polycrystalline co layers , which are widely used in spin - transfer devices .    in this paper , we report systematic studies of the thickness dependence of the linewidth and gilbert damping of ultra - thin co layers in @xmath7 pt@xmath2cu@xmath1 co@xmath2cu@xmath8 pt@xmath9 structures .",

    "there is no back flow of spin current . as a consequence , the gilbert damping of the fm is enhanced . for a symmetric film with two pt layers ,",
    "the effect is more pronounced because the pumping current is absorbed at the two interfaces with pt .",
    "furthermore , above 1.5 nm pt , the gilbert damping does not depend on the thickness of pt . in assuming that the film is continuous , a pt layer as thin as 1.5 nm is thus sufficient to act as a perfect spin sink , i.e.",

    "this can be seen by comparing the films with two pt layers and those with only the pt underlayer .",
    "the films grown with a pt underlayer ( @xmath14 nm ) and with or without top pt ( @xmath122 nm ) are expected to have similar microstructure , since the underlayer structure is identical ( @xmath91.5 nm pt@xmath210 nm cu ) .",
    "as a consequence , in the picture of two - magnon scattering induces linewidth broadening , the linewidth of those films should be the same .",
    "however , the thickness dependence of @xmath50 shows that the films with two pt layers have a larger linewidth than those with a single pt layer .",
    "we have conducted a fmr study of polycrystalline ultrathin co films embedded between 10 nm cu .",
    "the outer interfaces of cu were placed in contact with different environments , by adding pt layers . we have found that very thin co layers magnetization relaxation processes depend on the non - local environment .",
    "the co layers exhibit a lower magnetization density compared to the bulk material , and an uniaxial anisotropy field perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "the large difference between the g - factor value of the ultra - thin co layer compared to the bulk fcc co remains an open question .",
    "the fmr linewidth , studied as a function of the co layer thickness and of the non - local environment , increases with decreasing co layer thickness .",
    "we have provided evidence that the two - magnon scattering mechanism can not explain the thickness dependence of the linewidth .",
    "the inhomogeneous contribution to @xmath123 increases with decreasing co layer thickness , independently of the presence of the pt layer .",
    "however , the gilbert damping , the intrinsic contribution to the linewidth , was found to be function of the co layer thickness and depends on the non - local environment . in particular , the gilbert damping increases significantly with decreasing co layer thickness only in the presence of a pt@xmath2cu interface .",
    "the thickness dependence of g is consistent with the theory of spin pumping . by changing the outer interface environment of @xmath2cu@xmath2co@xmath2cu@xmath2 by adding or removing pt in contact with cu",
    ", we gave unambiguous experimental evidence that the damping enhancement is a non - local mechanism .",
    "the non - local damping becomes predominant compared with other relaxation mechanism when the co layer is a few nanometer thick ( @xmath1244 nm ) .    in summary , the adjacent layers material as well as the non - local environment are critical for understanding the magnetization relaxation in ultra - thin fms .",
    "this important result must be taking into account in the study of spin transfer devices .",
