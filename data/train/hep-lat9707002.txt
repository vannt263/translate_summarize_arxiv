    "lattice gauge models with charged scalars and fermions have been studied both analytically and numerically for some time @xcite .",
    "their phase diagrams display a rich structure with chiral and higgs transitions , as well as monopole condensation and percolation , and other topological excitations .",
    "in this paper we study the interplay of chiral symmetry breaking and monopole percolation in scalar qed with quenched fermions .",
    "abelian models can be rewritten by a duality transformation as theories of topological excitations , which help in determining their phase structure and critical behaviour @xcite .",
    "a classic example is the confinement transition of the pure compact @xmath2 lattice model , where monopole condensation was identified long ago as the underlying physical mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate whether magnetic monopoles affect fermionic theories , and , in particular , the physics of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration .",
    "the work of @xcite provides a theoretical framework for the study of the interplay of monopole and fermion dynamics , and a numerical strategy for its quantitative verification .",
    "unfortunately , it has not been developed into a predictive theory , complete with equations coupling monopole and fermion observables and their interrelated scaling laws .",
    "rather , it is just a ` physical picture ' which could even be internally inconsistent .",
    "the speculative scenario is interesting and will be summarized here because we will find some support for it in our simulation data ( although more conventional scenarios can accomodate the data as well ) .",
    "consider massless , pointlike fermions propagating in an ensemble of @xmath2 monopoles .",
    "suppose that the fermions experience only the @xmath2 gauge interaction .",
    "the fermion ",
    "monopole interaction is purely topological in origin because its strength is given by the product of the electric charge @xmath3 and the magnetic charge @xmath4 which are related by the dirac quantization condition , @xmath5 .",
    "this condition is renormalization group invariant , guarantees that the fermion ",
    "monopole interaction is always ` strong ' and survives conventional perturbative screening , and lies at the heart of electric - magnetic duality .",
    "suppose that the monopole network in the vacuum state of such an abelian @xmath2 model experiences a second order phase transition at a certain coupling @xmath6 where the monopole loops grow without bound .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the correlation length exponent for the transition .",
    "suppose also that ordinary photon exchange is not strong enough to cause a chiral transition near @xmath6 .",
    "then , since the fermion s chirality is not a conserved property in the presence of the pointlike monopole , the monopole transition could induce a chiral transition and the two point correlation function of @xmath8 should inherit the critical exponent @xmath7 from the monopole  loop transition .",
    "past measurements of monopole percolation have determined @xmath7 with good accuracy , @xmath9 , which is near the correlation length exponent of ordinary bond percolation in four dimensions . in any case , since @xmath7 is distinct from the mean field value of @xmath10 , this mechanism has been cited as a potential origin of interacting fermion field theories .",
    "this mechanism has been explored so far in non - compact models @xcite , where , however , monopole solutions can not be found analytically , monopoles are ( naively ) expected to decouple in the continuum limit , the dirac string costs action and static monopoles do not generate long  range coulomb fields .",
    "the ideal testing ground for the scenario of @xcite is a simple model with compact fields , a second order chiral transition and monopole percolation .",
    "when we begun this study the @xmath2 chiral transition was thought to be first order is chosen @xcite ( extended wilson action with @xmath11 term ) . ] .",
    "these considerations lead us to consider a fermion  scalar  compact @xmath2 model , where the existence of a second order chiral transition was well established both analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "note that this transition separates confinement from higgs phases , while the qed chiral transition separats confining and coulomb phases .    from a field theory point of view , this work continues the search for an interacting field theory which is strongly coupled at short distance @xcite .",
    "considerable work along this line has been invested in the study of the pure scalar  gauge model , with compact and non - compact gauge fields .",
    "detailed numerical studies have supported the idea that non - compact scalar qed is trivial  la @xmath12 by finding evidence for the tell  tale logarithms @xcite .",
    "analogous results were reported for the compact model in @xcite .",
    "the simulation results support the longheld theoretical prejudice that there is complete charge screening and the renormalized gauge coupling vanishes .",
    "in addition , in non - compact scalar qed monopole percolation turns out to be unrelated with the higgs transition @xcite .",
    "these results rise the question if the chiral nature of the transition in fermionic models might make the continuum limit non  trivial .    in a particle physics context , fermion ",
    "gauge  scalar models have been considered as possible toy models for the strongly coupled standard model @xcite .",
    "more recently , one such lattice model  dubbed in this context @xmath1   has been reconsidered in @xcite as a new mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation .",
    "recent results showed that the chiral transition line flows into the higgs transition line , terminating with a tricritical point , whose critical behaviour indicates nonpertubative renormalizability , consistent with a yukawa theory . the long term aim is to find out whether and how the physics of the @xmath1  model is different from that of the usual higgs ",
    "yukawa mechanism of fermion mass generation .",
    "for this reason , the triviality issue is not really central here : it might well be that the model provides an alternative to the usual higgs ",
    "yukawa mechanism , with higher upper bounds for its validity",
    ".    it would be interesting if the results of this paper could be of use to further sharpen the understanding of the tricritical point of the @xmath1   model .",
    "however , this is a quenched study and its relationship with the full model can only be judged a posteriori : a better understanding of the @xmath1   model , and/or of the validity of the quenched approximation , is not the primary scope of this work .",
    "our aim here is to illustrate some general dynamical mechanisms possibly relevant to continuum physics by investigating the interplay between chiral phase transition and monopole percolation .",
    "we choose to do so in the simplest possible situation : a scalar @xmath2 gauge model with quenched fermions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first we review the action and phase diagram of the @xmath1  model .",
    "we continue by discussing the topological excitations of abelian models , and the observables relevant for the chiral transition .",
    "section [ sec : topex ] gives an overview of the results for the topological excitations and show their correlations with other observables characterizing the phase diagram .",
    "these results confirm and extend the previous work of @xcite .",
    "after this general study , we focus on three points along the chiral transition line : in section [ sec : perc ] we present the results for the percolation of magnetic monopoles , in section [ sec : chipt ] those for the chiral transition .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and discussion .",
    "the @xmath1  model is defined by the action @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 are the kogut - susskind fermion fields , @xmath15 is a scalar field with frozen length @xmath16 , and @xmath17 represents the compact link variable .",
    "@xmath18 is the plaquette product of the link variables @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "the phase diagram of the quenched approximation is shown in figure  [ fig : pd4q2 ] .",
    "it has two phases , the coulomb phase and the confinement - higgs phase .",
    "the second is separated into two regions with different realizations of chiral symmetry , which are seperate phases in the chiral limit of the full model .",
    "the region with small @xmath20 and @xmath21 is chirally asymmetric , the one with large @xmath21 and @xmath20 is symmetric .",
    "these two regions are sometimes also called the confinement and higgs regions , respectively , because of the limiting cases @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    for @xmath24 the gauge and scalar fields can be integrated out exactly , leading to a lattice version of the njl model @xcite ( point n ) .",
    "the point e is the critical end point of the higgs phase transition line etc , which is a tricitical point in the chiral limit of the full model .",
    "t is the triple point and c the phase transition from the confinement ( at strong gauge coupling ) to the coulomb phase ( at weak gauge coupling ) in the model without the scalar field .",
    "s is the critical point of the spin model ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the status of the current investigation of the full model , including the dependence on the bare mass , can be found in @xcite . even though past lattice studies in the full model concentrated mostly on the tricritical point e ,",
    "the scaling behavior along the chiral phase transition ne except e is believed to be njl  like with reasonable accuracy @xcite . at e",
    "the scaling behavior is different , e.g.  the exponents seem to be nonclassical , which makes the point particularly interesting .    in this paper",
    "we study the quenched model , which corresponds to the limit @xmath25 in the update .",
    "the dynamics is the same as in scalar qed , or abelian higgs model , and @xmath26 is only considered for the measurement part .",
    "the qualitative features of the phase diagram are known to be the same as in the full model .",
    "the endpoint of the higgs transition line e is known with great accuracy @xcite .",
    "we expect that also in the quenched model the point n is described by mean field exponents , as observed in @xcite , probably with logarithmic corrections .",
    "the topological excitations of the model have been considered in @xcite . in our study",
    "we will characterize more fully the phase diagram using topological excitations and we will study in quantitative detail the chiral transition line extending from the point n to the endpoint e , and its interplay with the monopole percolation .",
    "in abelian models with compact fields the periodic nature of the interactions makes it possible to rewrite the action in terms of its topological excitations : magnetic monopole loops in pure compact qed , and closed vortex surfaces for pure scalar matter . for scalar  gauge systems",
    "there are strings of magnetic flux , i.e.  lattice monopoles , closed vortex surfaces and open surfaces bounded by monopole loops .",
    "these topological excitations , investigated in the continuum in @xcite , are amenable to numerical studies on the lattice @xcite .",
    "we review the main definitions below .",
    "the study of the chiral transition will follow @xcite .",
    "the relevant operators are reviewed in the last subsection .",

    "the vector @xmath35 is the total flux out of the cube @xmath36 at the dual site @xmath37 in direction @xmath38 : @xmath39 the loops of the monopoles ( on the dual lattice ) are closed , because of current conservation @xmath40 they are gauge invariant objects , whereas the dirac sheets , apart from their boundaries , can be distorted .    from this",
    "we calculate the monopole loop density , in short monopole density , as @xmath41    monopole percolation is detected using an order parameter borrowed from standard percolation models @xcite . a connected cluster of monopoles is introduced @xcite : one counts the number of dual sites @xmath42 which are connected with each other by monopole line elements .",
    "@xmath42 is the size of the cluster .",

    "the density of the occupied bonds reads @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of clusters with size @xmath42 , @xmath45 is the size of the largest cluster , and @xmath46 is the total number of connected sites .",

    "[ fig : top ] shows a overview of the results on the @xmath65 lattice . for @xmath66 ( a ) ( njl line )",
    "all observables are very smooth , only the ratio @xmath67 and the chiral condensate show a somewhat steeper descent .",
    "monopole and vortex density decrease slowly for increasing @xmath21 .",
    "more to the right on the ne line for @xmath68 ( b ) a similar behavior is observed but the transition region is somewhat smaller .    for @xmath69 ( c ) ( crosswise to the et line first order ) a steep descent in all observables at @xmath70 can be observed , as this is typical for first order phase transitions .",
    "obviously the monopoles and the vortices are sensitive to this phase transition .    at @xmath71 ( d ) ( crosswise to the ts line first order )",
    "a phase transition from coulomb to higgs phase can be observed . at this phase transition",
    "only the vortex density and the link energy are sensitive , which vary rapidly at @xmath72 .",
    "the other observables stay nearly constant .",

    "link energy and vortex density are insensitive to this phase transition .",
    "so , we have the following picture .",
    "consider the three regions of the phase diagram : coulomb phase , higgs region and confinement region . in the confinement region",
    "the monopole and vortex density are large and in the higgs region both are small . in the coulomb phase",
    "the vortex density is large and the monopole density small . at the first order phase transtions the observables which are large in one phase and small in the",
    "other show a steep decrease , whereas the others are insensitive .",
    "the order parameter of percolation @xmath67 follows ( essentially ) the monopole density but with more rapid changes .",
    "this could be understood in analogy to bond percolation .",
    "if the monopole density is high , percolating clusters are very likely , whereas for small monopole densities they are very unlikely .",
    "the first percolating clusters occur at some intermediate coupling . for large @xmath21 , along the line of first order phase transitions",
    ", this seems to coincide with the phase transition of the monopole density .",
    "such interplay of monopole condensation and percolation has been investigated before in pure compact qed in @xcite .    at the line ne , which is second order in the full theory , the situation is less obvious .    at the endpoint e of the higgs phase transition ,",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath75 and @xmath77 show a steep descent , which gets increasingly steeper for increasing lattice size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhomvor]a ) .",
    "the derivative of these observables show an increasing maximum . we have not done a scaling investigation but",
    "the data suggest a divergence .    for @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhomvor]b ) , still along the line ne , both densities show no maximum in the derivative . moreover , no volume dependence was observed .",
    "obviously they do not get critical in the region where the chiral condensate has its largest variation .",
    "for @xmath66 the picture is very similar to that at @xmath78 .",
    "the three @xmath21 values 0.00 , 0.30 , and 0.848 have been selected for the systematic investigation which we describe in the rest of this paper .",
    "in this section we measure the critical line for the percolation of the magnetic monopole clusters , and its critical exponents .",
    "an accurate measurement of the critical line is obtained thanks to the combined use of reweighting techniques , and the two definitions of monopole percolation @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "it is not in the scope of the present paper to investigate the relationship between the quenched and full model , but this is certainly an interesting subject for further investigations .",
    "finally , we might wonder about the sensitivity of the quality of the logarithmic fits and/or the value of the critical coupling to further corrections .",
    "typical corrections include powers of the logarithms .",
    "although such corrections are not there , up to o(1/@xmath201 ) , they can not be excluded in general .",
    "our model , however , could be in the yukawa universality class @xcite . in this case , one can conceive of sizeable variation , even in sign , of the exponents and the simplest parametrization of such crossover behavior would suggest that the powers in the logs should be kept free .",
    "it can not be excluded that more general logarithmic equations of state fit the data well , and certainly this would make the study of the interrelation between the chiral transition and monopole percolation more subtle .",

    "@xmath130 : the only clear statement here is that the higgs transition and monopole percolation are distinct . we have not been able to measure with confidence the chiral transition , which has proven hard to study with conventional numerical methods .",
    "since the scalar field increases the order in the gauge fields and favours chiral symmetry , separate chiral and monopole percolation transitions are not unexpected : it might well be that monopoles percolate in the symmetric phase , but their tendency to break chiral symmetry is overcome by the ordering effects of the scalar fields .",
    "this seems to be the case at @xmath97 , and it is also possible at @xmath98 ( if the first possibility is realized ) . in this case",
    "chiral transition is most probably mean field like along the whole line ne ( without the point e ) , as it seems to be in the full model .",
    "moreover , the chiral transition is separated from the percolation transition : when this is the case monopoles should be irrelevant to the dynamics of the chiral transition in the large volume , continuum limit . except for the point",
    "e ( we reiterate that we do nt have any conclusion on the relative position of monopoles and chiral transition at the point e ) this goes hand in hand with the transition being trivial .",
    "still , the behaviour at @xmath204 remains different from that at @xmath205 , and and it would be interesting to find a coherent scenario accomodating these observations .",
    "the scenario of @xcite requires instead a chiral transition coincident with the percolation transition , and sharing the same correlation length exponent .",
    "when this occurs , the dynamics of the chiral transition should inherit the characteristics of that of the magnetic monopoles , which survive the non  trivial continuum limit .",
    "this could be the case at @xmath98 .",
    "the scenario of @xcite receives then some support from our investigation .",
    "important questions concern the relevance of these results for the full model , and , in general , the sensitivity to the number of flavours .",
    "if the scenario of @xcite is realized , the situation is different from the one observed in the full model : if this is the case , fermion screening plays an important role in this model as it presumably does in the gauged nambu jona lasinio model : there the ladder ( quenched ) approximation predicts a non  mean field scenario @xcite , while the full model is presumably trivial@xcite .",
    "these observations do not detract from the illustrative value of our results at @xmath98 , but , of course , prevent us from extending any of our conclusions to the full model at this stage of our investigation .",
    "if the full and quenched models really have different critical behavior along the line ne , then we are challenged to understand something unexpected and special about fermionic screening in this model . in the present quenched model , the dynamical scalar field in the configurations",
    "completely screens the electric charge , producing a vanishing renormalized gauge coupling in this sector of the model .",
    "if the fermions were also treated dynamically , they would add nothing qualitatively new in terms of charge screening .",
    "therefore , the fermion  monopole interaction would have to have some essential ingredient which renders the monopoles ineffective in driving chiral symmetry breaking in the full model . simulations of non - compact qed with the number of flavors @xmath206 varying from @xmath207 to @xmath208 , do not show such an effect  there chiral symmetry breaking and monopole percolation were coincident , within ample errorbars , for all @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "better simulations of the full and quenched models with smaller bare fermion masses and larger lattices are needed now .",
    "we should define better numerical strategies so to show more clearly the correlation , or lack thereof , between chiral and monopole observables .",
    "it is however evident from our data , that for @xmath66 , when the chiral and monopole transitions are clearly distinct , the chiral transition is clearly trivial and is not correlated with the percolation of monopoles .",
