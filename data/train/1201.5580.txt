    "the combined maxima-1 @xcite , boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and cobe / dmr cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xcite and that most of the matter in the universe is dark @xcite , i.e. exotic . combining the data of these quite precise experiments one finds : @xmath0",
    "since any `` invisible '' non exotic component can not possibly exceed @xmath1 of the above @xmath2  @xcite , exotic ( non baryonic ) matter is required and there is room for cold dark matter candidates or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .    even though there exists firm indirect evidence for a halo of dark matter in galaxies from the observed rotational curves , see e.g the review @xcite , it is essential to directly detect such matter . the possibility of such detection , however , depends on the nature of the dark matter constituents and their interactions . since the wimp s",
    "are expected to be extremely non relativistic , with average kinetic energy @xmath3 , they are not likely to excite the nucleus .",
    "so they can be directly detected mainly via the recoiling of a nucleus ( a , z ) in elastic scattering .",
    "the event rate for such a process can be computed from the following ingredients@xcite : i ) the elementary nucleon cross section .",
    "ii ) knowledge of the relevant nuclear matrix elements @xcite , obtained with as reliable as possible many body nuclear wave functions , iii ) knowledge of the wimp density in our vicinity and its velocity distribution .",
    "the nucleon cross sections can also be extracted from the data of event rates , if and when such data become available . from limits on the event rates ,",
    "one can obtain exclusion plots on the nucleon cross sections as functions of the wimp mass . in the standard nuclear recoil experiments , first proposed more than 30 years ago @xcite , one has to face the problem that the reaction of interest does not have a characteristic feature to distinguish it from the background .",
    "so for the expected low counting rates the background is a formidable problem .",
    "some special features of the wimp - nuclear interaction can be exploited to reduce the background problems .",
    "such are :    \\i ) the modulation effect : this yields a periodic signal due to the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "unfortunately this effect , also proposed a long time ago @xcite and subsequently studied by many authors @xcite , is small and becomes even smaller than @xmath4 due to cancelations arising from nuclear physics effects , ii ) backward - forward asymmetry expected in directional experiments , i.e. experiments in which the direction of the recoiling nucleus is also observed .",
    "such an asymmetry has also been predicted a long time ago @xcite , but it has not been exploited , since such experiments have been considered very difficult to perform , but they now appear to be feasible@xcite .",
    "iii ) transitions to excited states : in this case one need not measure nuclear recoils , but the de - excitation @xmath5 rays",
    ". this can happen only in very special cases since the average wimp energy is too low to excite the nucleus .",
    "it has , however , been found that in the special case of the target @xmath6i such a process is feasible @xcite with branching ratios around @xmath7 , ( iv ) detection of electrons produced during the wimp - nucleus collision @xcite and v ) detection of hard x - rays produced when the inner shell holes are filled@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will limit our attention to the standaerd recoil experiments and study the differential event rates , both time averaged and modulated , in the region of low energy transfers , as in the dama experiment @xcite , focusing our attention on relatively light wimps @xcite .",
    "such light wimps can be accommodated in some susy models @xcite .",
    "we will also present some results on the total rates as well .",
    "we will employ here the standard maxwell - boltzmann ( m - b ) distribution for the wimps of our galaxy and we will not be concerned with other distributions @xcite , even though some of them may affect the modulation .",
    "the latter will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we will explicitly show that the modulation amplitude , entering both the differential and the total rates , changes sign for certain reduced wimp - nuclear masses . as a result",
    "such an effect , if and when the needed data become available , may be exploited to infer the wimp mass .",

    "they are , of course , simply scaled down by @xmath36 , if one takes the spin cross section , a combination of the nuclear spin me and the nucleon spin amplitudes , to be the same with the coherent nucleon cross section , i.e. @xmath37pb . for the actual spin nucleon cross sections extracted from experiment see @xcite and @xcite .    the functions",
