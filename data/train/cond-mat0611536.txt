    "many strong correlation problems of current interest relate to the physics of doped mott insulators .",
    "most observed metallic states can be understood in conventional terms : ordering associated with broken spin or lattice symmetries , along with fermi surfaces of charge @xmath0 , spin 1/2 quasiparticles .",
    "nevertheless , the details of the state differ depending upon the importance we attach to strong correlation physics _ e.g. _ different fermi surface topologies and magnetic moment configurations are obtained from the weak and strong interaction limits , namely ( _ i _ ) a spin density wave instability of the free electron band structure , or ( _ ii _ ) a spin - wave theory of a lightly doped magnetically ordered mott insulator .",
    "it is clear that rich physics lies in understanding the interpolation between such limiting regimes , and that there a number of important applications _ e.g. _ to the widely discussed differences between the underdoped and overdoped cuprates .",
    "a central question is whether there could be a single continuous quantum phase transition between such states with distinct types of order or fermi surface topologies ( recent experiments @xcite on cerhin@xmath2 are compatible with an abrupt or very rapid change in fermi surface topology ) .",
    "such critical points could be the key to understanding the many observed ` non - fermi liquid ' properties .",
    "however , a complete critical field theory of a continuous transition between such states has so far been presented only in insulators  @xcite , where the two states have broken symmetries which can not be connected by a continuous transition in landau theory ; instead a ` deconfined ' theory focussing not on order parameters but on fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge forces shows that such transitions are indeed possible .",
    "an extension of these ideas to metallic systems has been discussed @xcite , including a scenario which would allow for a discontinuous change in a fermi surface .",
    "others @xcite have proposed a ` local quantum critical ' scenario for transitions between states with different fermi surface topologies , based upon numerical studies in extensions to dynamic mean field theory .",
    "however , the analytic structure of this mean field transition remains unclear , and it is not clear how , even in principle , this ` local critical ' structure can be extended beyond mean field theory .",
    "tunes the insulator across the nel - vbs transition , and @xmath3 is the mobile hole density .",
    "the deconfined quantum critical point is at @xmath4 in the insulator with @xmath5 . the vacancies ( ` holons ' ) carry a gauge charge @xmath6 under an emergent u(1 ) gauge force . in the cartoons above , the reader can interpret @xmath7 as a sublattice label . in the @xmath8 , nel phase",
    ", @xmath7 determines the spin : a vacancy on an up ( down ) spin site carries net spin down ( up ) and so is equivalent to a charge @xmath0 spin-1/2 hole . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the hole is a composite of a vacancy and a nearby unpaired spin with opposite @xmath7 , moving by rearranging nearest - neighbor valence bonds ; note that this motion preserves spin and sublattice quantum numbers _ separately _ ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "so there are twice as many states per momentum for a charge @xmath0 spin 1/2 hole in the vbs state than there are in the nel state.,width=624 ]    .",

    "only the fermi surfaces within this zone contribute to the luttinger counting , and so the area of each ellipse is @xmath16 . in the vbs phase ,",
    "all 4 pockets are inequivalent , and so the area of each ellipse is @xmath17 .",
    "the dashed lines now show the reduction of the brillouin zone due to the vbs order which appears at sufficiently low temperatures ; `` shadow '' fermi sufaces , with weak photoemission intensity ( estimated in the text ) , will appear as reflections across these lines , and these fermi surfaces are not shown .",
    ", width=624 ]    in this paper , we will build on the theory of the deconfined quantum critical point proposed in ref .   for insulating spin @xmath18 antiferromagnets on the square lattice @xcite ;",
    "the transition is between ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) a state with magnetic nel order ( with spin polarized in the staggered configuration ) to a spin - gap state with valence bond solid ( vbs ) order ( which is spin rotation invariant , but breaks lattice symmetries by ordering of valence bonds ) .",
    "we will describe the metallic states obtained by doping this system with a small density ( @xmath3 ) of holes .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] summarize our key results , and the captions support them with simple physical arguments .",
    "the decoupling of the spin and u(1 ) gauge charge in the vbs phase described in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the consequent doubling of the hole flavors in fig .  [ fig2 ] , leads to our precise result : the discontinuity in @xmath19 on the two sides of the nel - vbs quantum critical point , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the evolution of the fermi surface along the fixed @xmath3 line @xmath20 in fig  [ fig1 ] involves separate questions associated with the interplay between the mobile holes and the @xmath4 deconfined critical point .",
    "if the @xmath5 monopole - induced confinement physics @xcite survives for @xmath21 , then there will be a single critical line which is crossed by @xmath20 at which the fermi surface changes discontinuously .",
    "however , this appears unlikely because the monopoles can be screened by the charge carriers @xcite , leading to a narrow intermediate fractionalized ` holon metal ' phase with no conventional fermi surface within the shaded region . in either case , there is a wide momentum , frequency , and temperature regime over which the hole spectral function is incoherent .",
    "we will show here that this is described by a universal theory of a single localized vacancy @xcite coupled to the 2 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory of the @xmath5 , @xmath4 critical point .",
    "the incoherent , critical hole spectral function is momentum - independent , and so while this view of the transition has a ` local ' character @xcite , the degrees of freedom include a non - trivial , bulk quantum field theory .",
    "further , we believe that the evolution of the fermionic excitations across the shaded region of fig  [ fig1 ] can not be captured by dynamic mean field theory methods or self - consistent impurity models .",
    "the motion of charge carriers doped into an insulating square - lattice quantum antiferromagnet is conventionally described by the `` @xmath22-@xmath23 '' model , @xmath24 where @xmath25 creates an electron with spin @xmath26 on the sites @xmath27 of a square lattice and @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the constraint @xmath29 is enforced on each site , modelling the large local repulsion between the electrons .",
    "it is important to note that our results are more general than a particular @xmath22-@xmath23 model , and follow almost completely from symmetry considerations .",

    "the inclusion of monopole tunneling events shows that this spin liquid is ultimately unstable to confinement and the development of vbs order @xcite .",
    "this monopole physics is peripheral to our main results , and so we defer its discussion until later .    now we need to add charge carriers to this antiferromagnet . we have represented the spin excitations of the antiferromagnet by schwinger bosons above , and so the charge carriers require a spinless fermion @xmath39 , the ` holon ' ( see appendix  [ app : psg ] for more details ) .",
    "such a mean - field lattice study has been carried out some time ago in refs .  .",
    "we can take the low energy limit of their results , and so obtain the field theory needed for our analysis .",
    "however , we can also proceed on symmetry grounds , when our main ingredients are the transformation properties of the various fields under square lattice symmetry operations .",
    "because the elementary quanta also carry u(1 ) gauge charges , it is not required that the fields be invariant under such operations , only their gauge - invariant combinations .",

    "the holon co - ordinate is represented by @xmath171 and that of the spinon by @xmath172 .",
    "the kets describing the motion of the bound state can be labeled in terms of the momentum @xmath173 of the bound state center - of - mass , @xmath174 the kets correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath175 and have been written in terms of the `` first - quantized '' ground state wavefunction @xmath176 of the holon - spinon interaction , @xmath177 .",
