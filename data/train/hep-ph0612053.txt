    "the main result , as a consequence of fluctuations , is the emerge of a new scaling behaviour for the dipole - hadron ( proton or nucleus ) scattering amplitude at high rapidities  @xcite , different from the geometric scaling behaviour which is the hallmark of the `` mean field '' evolution equations ( jimwlk  @xcite and bk  @xcite equations ) , and which is named _",

    "we focus on the consequences of fluctuations on the ratio @xmath0 of the unintegrated gluon distribution of a nucleus over the unintegrated gluon distribution of a proton scaled up by the atomic factor @xmath1 .",
    "the `` pomeron loop equations '' describing the evolution of the dipole - hadron scattering amplitude with increasing rapidity @xmath6 are stochastic equations . in a frame",
    "where most of the rapidity is given to the hadron , the stochastic evolution of the hadron gives rise to different gluon distributions from one event to another  @xcite .",
    "the random variable in the evolution , the logarithm of the saturation momentum @xmath7 , can therefore vary in an event by event basis .",
    "this variation is characterized by the dispersion @xmath8 which rises linearly with rapidity , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the dispersion coefficient and @xmath11 . for rapidities @xmath12 ,",
    "the dispersion is small @xmath13 , meaning that the effect of fluctuations on the scaling form of the unintegrated gluon distribution can be neglected , while for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , fluctuations become important and do change the scaling form of the unintegrated gluon distribution .",

    "furthermore @xmath0 turns out basically @xmath20 and @xmath3 independent in the common geometric scaling regime .",
    "the explanation is that the unintegrated gluon distributions of the nucleus and of the proton preserve their shapes with rising rapidity in the geometric scaling regime , yielding thus a constant value for their ratio , as shown for two different rapidities in fig .",

    "this ratio shows two features which are different as compared to the ratio in the geometric scaling regime : ( i ) for @xmath24 close to @xmath25 , the gluon shadowing characterized by @xmath26 is dominated by fluctuations , through @xmath27 , and depends also on the difference @xmath28 .",
    "gluon shadowing increases as the rapidity increases because of @xmath29 . at asymptotic rapidity , where @xmath30 , one obtains _ total gluon shadowing _ , @xmath31 , which means that the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleus and that of the proton become the same in the diffusive scaling regime .",
    "total gluon shadowing is an effect of fluctuations since the fluctuations make the unintegrated gluon distributions of the nucleus and of the proton flatter and flatter  @xcite and their ratio closer and closer to @xmath32 ( at fixed @xmath28 ) with rising rapidity as illustrated in fig.[gs](b ) .",
    "( total gluon shadowing is not possible in the geometric scaling regime in the fixed - coupling case since the shapes of the gluon distributions of the nucleus and of the proton remain the same with increasing @xmath3 giving for their ratio a value unequal one , see fig  [ gs](a ) ) .",
    "( ii ) @xmath0 shows an increase with rising @xmath33 ( always @xmath34 ) within the diffusive scaling region .",
