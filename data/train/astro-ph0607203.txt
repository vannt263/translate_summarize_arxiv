    ", the outer planets of our solar system were likely embedded in a 10@xmath3 disk of rock and ice containing the precursors of the oort cloud ( dones et al .",
    "2004 ) and the kuiper belt ( see the reviews by chiang et al .  2006 ;",

    "the gravitational back - reaction felt by planets as they scatter and scour planetesimals causes the planets to migrate ( fernndez & ip 1984 ; murray et al .",
    "1998 ; hahn & malhotra 1999 ; gomes , morbidelli , & levison 2004 ) .",
    "neptune is thought to have migrated outward and thereby trapped kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) into its exterior mean - motion resonances , both of low - order such as the 3:2 ( malhotra 1995 ) and of high - order such as the 5:2 ( chiang et al .",
    "2003 ; hahn & malhotra 2005 ) .",
    "likewise , jupiter s inward migration may explain the existence of hilda asteroids in 2:3 resonance with the gas giant ( franklin et al .",
    "a few pairs of extra - solar planets , locked today in 2:1 resonance ( vogt et al .",
    "2005 ; lee et al .",
    "2006 ) , may have migrated to their current locations within parent disks composed of gas and/or planetesimals .",
    "orbital migration and resonant trapping of dust grains may also be required to explain non - axisymmetric structures observed in debris disks surrounding stars 10100 myr old ( e.g. , wyatt 2003 ; meyer et al .  2006 ) .",
    "only when orbital migration is sufficiently smooth and slow can resonances trap bodies .",
    "the slowness criterion requires migration to be adiabatic : over the time the planet takes to migrate across the width of the resonance , its resonant partner must complete at least a few librations .",
    "otherwise the bodies speed past resonance ( e.g. , dermott , malhotra , & murray 1988 ; chiang 2003 ; quillen 2006 ) .",
    "smoothness requires that changes in the planet s orbit which are incoherent over timescales shorter than the libration time do not accumulate unduly .",
    "orbital migration driven by gravitational scattering of discrete planetesimals is intrinsically not smooth .",
    "a longstanding concern has been whether neptune s migration was too `` noisy '' to permit resonance capture and retention ( see , e.g. , morbidelli , brown , & levison 2003 ) . in n - body simulations of migration within planetesimal disks ( hahn & malhotra 1999 ; gomes et al .",
    "2004 ; tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ) , n @xmath4 is still too small to produce the large , order - unity capture efficiencies seemingly demanded by the current census of resonant kbos .    at the same time , the impediment against resonance capture introduced by inherent stochasticity has been exploited to explain certain puzzling features of the kuiper belt , most notably the classical ( non - resonant ) belt s outer truncation radius , assumed to lie at a heliocentric distance of @xmath548 au ( trujillo & brown 2001 ; levison & morbidelli 2003 ) .",
    "if neptune s 2:1 resonance captured kbos and released them en route , classical kbos could have been transported ( `` combed '' ) outwards to populate the space interior to the final position of the 2:1 resonance , at a semi - major axis of 47.8 au ( levison & morbidelli 2003 ) .",
    "as originally envisioned , this scenario requires that @xmath5@xmath6 be trapped inside the 2:1 resonance so that an attendant secular resonance suppresses growth of eccentricity during transport .",
    "it further requires that the degree of stochasticity be such that the migration is neither too smooth nor too noisy .",
    "whether these requirements were actually met remain open questions.0.1 smacks of observational bias and motivates us to re - visit the problem of whether an edge actually exists , or at least whether the edge bears any relation to the 2:1 resonance . ]",
    "stochastic migration has also been studied in gas disks , in which noise is driven by density fluctuations in turbulent gas .",
    "laughlin , steinacker , & adams ( 2004 ) and nelson ( 2005 ) propose that stochasticity arising from gas that is unstable to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) can significantly prolong a planet s survival time against accretion onto the parent star .",
    "the spectrum of density fluctuations is computed by numerical simulations of assumed turbulent gas .    in this work , we study stochastic changes to a planet s orbit due to planetesimal scatterings .",
    "the planet s brownian motion arises from both poisson variations in the rate at which a planet encounters planetesimals , and from random fluctuations in the mix of planet - planetesimal encounter geometries .",
    "how does the vigor of a planet s random walk depend on the masses and orbital properties of surrounding planetesimals ?",
    "we answer this question in  [ sec - oom ] by constructing an analytic theory for how a migrating planet s semi - major axis fluctuates about its mean value .",
    "we employ order - of - magnitude physics , verifying our assertions whenever feasible by tailored numerical integrations . because the properties of planetesimal disks during the era of planetary migration are so uncertain",
    ", we consider a wide variety of possibilities for how planetesimal semi - major axes and eccentricities are distributed .",
    "one of the fruits of our labors will be identification of the conditions under which a planet s migration is maximally stochastic .    apportioning a fixed disk mass to fewer , larger planetesimals renders migration more noisy .",
    "how noisy is too noisy for resonance capture ?",
    "what limits can we place on the sizes of planetesimals that would keep capture of resonant kbos by a migrating neptune a viable hypothesis ?",
    "these questions are answered in  [ sec - sizes ] , where we write down a simple analytic formula for the retention efficiency of a resonance as a function of disk properties , including planetesimal size .",
    "quantifying the size spectrum of planetesimals is crucial for deciphering the history of planetary systems .",
    "many scenarios for the evolution of the kuiper belt implicitly assume that most of the mass of the primordial outer solar system was locked in planetesimals having sizes of @xmath7 km , like those observed today ( see , e.g. , chiang et al .",
    "2006 for a critique of these scenarios ) .",
    "by contrast , coagulation simulations place the bulk of the mass in bodies having sizes of @xmath8 km ( kenyon & luu 1999 ) . for ice giant formation to proceed _ in situ _ in a timely manner in the outer solar system , most of the primordial disk may have to reside in small , sub - km bodies ( goldreich , lithwick , & sari  2004 ) .    in  [ sec - sum ] , in addition to summarizing our findings , we extend them in a few directions .",
    "the main thrust of this paper is to analyze how numerous , small perturbations to a planet s orbit accumulate .",
    "we extend our analysis in ",
    "[ sec - sum ] to quantify the circumstances under which a single kick to the planet from an extremely large planetesimal can disrupt the resonance .",
    "we also examine perturbations exerted directly on resonant kbos by ambient planetesimals .",

    "we decompose the rate of change of the planet s semi - major axis , @xmath9 , into average and random components , @xmath10 the average component ( `` signal '' ) arises from any global asymmetry in the way a planet scatters planetesimals , e.g. , an asymmetry due to systematic differences between planetesimals inside and outside a planet s orbit .",

    "[ sec - super ] , we argue this restriction is sufficient for our purposes .",

    "thus , a co - orbital ring of planetesimals on horseshoe orbits with sub - hill eccentricities increases the stochasticity generated by planetesimals on non - horseshoe , non - crossing orbits by a factor of at most order unity ( under the assumption that disk properties are roughly constant within several hill radii of the planet ) .",
    "for this reason , and also because the horseshoe region may well have been depleted of planetesimals compared to the rest of the disk , we omit consideration of co - orbital , sub - hill planetesimals for the remainder of the paper , confident that the error so incurred will be at most order unity .",
    "what about planetesimals on horseshoe orbits with super - hill eccentricities ( @xmath122 ) ? upon encountering the planet , such objects can have their semi - major axes changed by @xmath123whereupon they are expelled from the 1:1 horseshoe resonance . because highly eccentric , horseshoe resonators are unstable , we neglect consideration of them for the rest of our study .",
    "we now extend our analysis from individual encounters to the cumulative stochasticity generated by a disk with surface density @xmath124 in planetesimals of a single mass @xmath125 .",

    "systematic trends in @xmath133 with @xmath117say , systematically more objects encountered interior to the planet s orbit than exterior to it  cause the planet to migrate along an average trajectory with velocity @xmath134 .    random fluctuations in ( a ) the number of planetesimals encountered per fixed time interval and ( b ) the mix of planetesimals pre - encounter orbital elements cause the planet to random walk about this average trajectory .",
    "contribution ( a ) is straightforward to model .",
    "the probability that the planet encounters @xmath135 objects located a distance @xmath117 away in time @xmath131 is given by poisson statistics : @xmath136 the variance in @xmath135 is @xmath137 fluctuations in @xmath135 drive the planet either towards or away from the star with equal probability and with typical speed @xmath138 hereafter the root - mean - squared ( rms ) speed . while @xmath139 , the distance random walked @xmath140 .",
    "our assumption of poisson statistics is reasonable . in the sub - hill case ,",
    "a planet - planetesimal encounter requires a time @xmath141 ( equation [ [ eqn - delt1 ] ] ) to complete .",

    "we assume in this paper that this does not happen  that the orbits of planetesimals interacting with the planet are randomized on a timescale @xmath143 .",
    "we expect this inequality to be enforced by a combination of ( i ) randomization of planetesimal orbits due to encounters with the planet ( e.g. , encounters within the chaotic zone of the planet [ wisdom 1980 ] ) , ( ii ) phase mixing of planetesimals due to keplerian shear ( which occurs on timescale @xmath144 for planetesimals distributed between @xmath117 and @xmath5@xmath145 ) , ( iii ) gravitational interactions between planetesimals , and ( iv ) physical collisions between planetesimals . as long as @xmath143",

    "contribution ( b ) is difficult to model precisely since we do not know how orbital elements of planetesimals are distributed .",

    "but a planetesimal that starts in exterior resonance with an inwardly migrating planet can remain in resonance for a finite time .",
    "goldreich ( 1965 ) demonstrates how an outwardly migrating body adds angular momentum to a test particle in exterior resonance at just the right rate to keep the particle in resonance .",

    "the random component of the planet s migration can cause the planetesimal to be recaptured , but a recaptured particle lies on a trajectory near the separatrix and quickly re - escapes in practice . once the average ( outward ) component of the planet s migration carries the resonance well past the particle , the particle can not be recaptured even if @xmath228 random walks back to zero ; in other words , the particle has been permanently left behind .",
    "a particle that escapes by being dropped in front of the resonance ( @xmath229 ) is also lost more often than not .",

    "the size distributions of kenyon & luu ( 1999 ) resemble @xmath357 power laws , but with a large overabundance of planetesimals having sizes of @xmath352 .",
    "this sequestration of mass dramatically reduces the stochasticity generated by the largest bodies , which have sizes of @xmath358 .",
    "we conclude that neptune s brownian motion did not impede in any substantive way the planet s capture and retention of resonant kbos .",
    "our focus thus far has been on the regime in which many stochastic kicks to the planet are required for resonant particles to escape .",
    "of course , a single kick from a planetesimal having sufficiently large mass @xmath359 could flush particles from resonance . to estimate @xmath359",
    ", we equate the change in the planet s semi - major axis from a single encounter , @xmath15 , to the maximum half - width of the resonance , @xmath222 ( see equation [ [ eqn - aplib ] ] and related discussion ) .",
    "in the likely event that the perturber s eccentricity @xmath20 is of order unity , then @xmath360 ( equation [ [ eqn - delamax ] ] ) and therefore @xmath361 for plutinos to escape resonance .",
    "our estimate for @xmath359 agrees with that of malhotra ( 1993 ) .",
    "why such enormous perturbers have not been observed today is unclear and casts doubt on their existence ( morbidelli , jacob , & petit 2002 ) .",
    "if such an earth - mass planetesimal were present over the duration @xmath230 of neptune s migration , then the likelihood of a resonance - destabilizing encounter would be @xmath362 , where the encounter rate @xmath154 is given by equation ( [ eqn - ndot ] ) with @xmath363 , and we have set @xmath364 .",
    "finally , we have ignored in this work how disk planetesimals directly perturb the semi - major axis of a resonant particle .",
    "this neglect does not significantly alter our conclusions .",
    "take the resonant planetesimal to resemble a typical resonant kbo observed today , having size @xmath365 .",
    "then its hill velocity is @xmath366 .",
    "the relative velocity between the resonant planetesimal and an ambient , perturbing planetesimal greatly exceeds this hill velocity , if only because migration in resonant lock quickly raises the eccentricity of the resonant planetesimal above @xmath367 . equation ( [ eqn - superrms ] ) , appropriate for the super - hill regime , implies that @xmath368the rms random velocity does not depend on the mass of the object being perturbed !",
    "therefore when both the resonant planetesimal and the planet are scattering planetesimals in the super - hill regime , their random walks are comparable in vigor .",
    "the conservative limit of @xmath7 km on the planetesimal size which allows resonance retention is derived , by contrast , for the sub - hill , maximum stochasticity regime , and is therefore little affected by these considerations .",
    "this work was made possible by grants from the national science foundation , nasa , and the alfred p.  sloan foundation .",
