    "<S> the simplicity of the initial state and the possibility of study of many different combinations of final states making this process very useful for studying the qcd dynamics in the limit of high center - of - mass energy @xmath8 and fixed momentum transfer @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the domain where we could expect bfkl pomeron theory @xcite to be applicable , provided that a hard scale exist which allows to use perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> it has motivated the theoretical and experimental analysis of several reactions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the @xmath10 total cross section , using the forward solution of the bfkl equation , was calculated in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the photon virtuality provides the hard scale . </S>",
    "<S> one have that while the two - gluon approximation does not describe the opal and l3 data points , the leading order ( lo ) bfkl prediction lies above the data . </S>",
    "<S> first attempts to include the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the bfkl equation are encouraging @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the heavy quark production in @xmath11 collisions was estimated in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , demonstrating that the experimental analysis of this process can be useful to constrain the qcd dynamics . in this case , the hard scale is the photon virtuality and/or the heavy quark mass . a comparison with the data from the l3 collaboration is presented e.g. in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility to study the bfkl theory is the double vector meson production in @xmath11 collisions @xcite . in this process and in the general case </S>",
    "<S> there can be three large momentum scales - the photon virtuality , @xmath12 , the vector meson mass @xmath13 and the momentum transfer @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the double light vector meson production has been extensively analyzed considering distinct approximations @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the hard scale was provided by the photon virtuality and only the forward solution from the bfkl equation was calculated . on the other hand , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have estimated , for the first time , the double vector meson production at photon colliders considering the non - forward solution of the lo bfkl equation at high energy and large momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> it has allowed to estimate the total and differential cross section for the production of heavy and light vector mesons in real photon interactions . in that study </S>",
    "<S> we have restricted our analysis for photon colliders . in order to estimate the feasibility of this process </S>",
    "<S> it is important also compute the corresponding @xmath7 cross sections . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we extend our previous analyzes and calculate the double diffractive vector meson production in @xmath0 collisions assuming the dominance of the bfkl pomeron exchange and estimating the event rates for the future linear colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> two - photon processes at future high energy linear colliders can be measured either as in a storage ring , via photon emission from the lepton beams , according to a weizscker - williams ( ww ) energy distribution , or using a linear collider in photon collider mode ( for a recent review see , e.g. refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the high energy electron beam is converted into a high energy photon beam , by backscattering of photons off an intense laser beam , just before the interaction point . </S>",
    "<S> considering @xmath0 collisions , current conservation and the small photon virtuality lead to a factorization of the lepton scattering cross sections into the photon spectrum in the lepton and the hard photon scattering cross section @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> v_1 v_2 ( ) = _ </S>",
    "<S> t_min^  dt ( ) [ sigtot ] is the total cross section of the photon - photon subprocess . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath31 is a cut - off in the momentum transfer ( see discussion below ) .    at high energies </S>",
    "<S> the double diffractive meson production is expected to be described in terms of the bfkl pomeron @xcite . at leading logarithmic approximation </S>",
    "<S> , it corresponds to a sum of ladder diagrams with reggeized gluons along the chain , with the sum being described by the bfkl equation @xcite . considering the impact factor representation and the bfkl dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , the differential cross section for the @xmath21 will be expressed by ( for details see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) @xmath32 where the bfkl amplitude @xmath33 , in the leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) and lowest conformal spin ( @xmath34 ) , is given by  @xcite @xmath35 in the eqs . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , @xmath45 is proportional to the bkfl kernel eigenvalues  ( see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , with @xmath46 being the digamma function . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath47 are given in terms of the impact factors @xmath48 and the bfkl eigenfunctions as follows @xcite , @xmath49 where the constant @xmath50 may be related to the vector meson leptonic decay width , @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section can be directly calculated substituting the above expression in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bfkla ] ) and evaluating numerically the integrals . following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we will assume the non - relativistic approximation of the meson wave functions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> as the differential cross section is proportional to @xmath56 and the energy dependence is determined by the variable @xmath57 , which is dependent of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 values , we have a strong dependence of our predictions on the choice of these parameters ( for a more detailed discussion see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar dependence is expected for the predictions presented in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> these uncertainties will be reduced considering in the calculations the nlo corrections to the impact factors and non - forward bfkl kernel .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the total cross section for the process @xmath60 with @xmath61 and different values of the center of mass energy ( @xmath62 200 , 500 , 1000 e 3000 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we will assume @xmath63 30 mrad . </S>",
    "<S> as our calculations for the @xmath21 subprocess are only valid at high energies we should to exclude the region where the bfkl dynamics is expected to break down . </S>",
    "<S> this restriction is present in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigtee2 ] ) in terms of the theta function , where we have defined a minimum value for the center of mass energy of the hard subprocess , @xmath64 . here </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath65 gev , independently of the hadronic final state produced . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for double light meson production , the hard scale for the @xmath21 subprocess is provided by the momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in the calculation of the total cross section [ eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigtot ] ) ] a lower cut - off in the @xmath9-integration is necessary in order to minimize non - perturbative ( soft pomeron ) contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we choose in this case @xmath66 gev@xmath67 , which is reasonable considering that the hera data for the photoproduction of light vector mesons in this kinematic region are quite well described using a similar approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we assume @xmath68 when at least a heavy meson is produced , since in this case we have a hard scale present which justifies the perturbative calculations in the low-@xmath9 ( @xmath69 ) region . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that a soft pomeron contribution is not included in our calculations ( see e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our predictions for the double diffractive meson production in @xmath0 collisions are presented in the tables [ tabfklh ] and [ tabfkll ] considering the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we also show the results obtained at the born level , which corresponds to the two gluon exchange mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that although the born term implies an energy independent cross section at the photon level , its predictions for the @xmath7 cross sections have a weak energy dependence due to the photon flux factor . as already observed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the cross sections decrease when a heavier vector meson is considered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the bfkl dynamics implies an enhancement of the cross section in comparison to the two - gluon exchange predictions , which can reach two orders of magnitude , depending of the energy and mesons involved in the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> previous estimates for the double @xmath70 and @xmath71 production in @xmath0 collisions has been obtained in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the production of other combinations of vector mesons in the final state considering the bfkl dynamics are estimate here for the first time . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors have solved the bfkl equation taking into account dominant non - leading effects which come from the requirement that the virtuality of the exchanged gluons along the gluon ladder is controlled by their transverse momentum squared and have estimated the double @xmath70 production at lep2 energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have that our predictions are similar with those obtained there if we consider the same experimental cuts and energy . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed comparison of the energy dependence is not possible , since it is not analyzed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath71 production in @xmath7 collisions was previously estimated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where this process was proposed as a probe of the gluon distribution on the meson @xmath72 and , by consequence , a constrain for the photon structure . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions agree with the results presented there , only presenting a steeper energy growth . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected since we are using the lo solution of the bfkl equation , while in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the energy dependence is determined by the gluon distribution of the light meson which has a smaller intercept .    </S>",
    "<S> .the double vector meson production cross sections in @xmath7 processes at different energies , @xmath73 and @xmath74 mrad , assuming the bfkl pomeron ( two - gluon ) exchange . </S>",
    "<S> cross sections are given in pb . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^ , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]     finally , lets estimate the expected number of events of some of the processes calculated in this paper for the future linear colliders @xcite . for @xmath7 collisions with center of mass energies equal to @xmath75 gev , luminosities of order @xmath76 , 200 and 220 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 are expected at tesla , clic and ilc , respectively . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ numev ] we present our predictions for the number of events per year for the @xmath78 , @xmath71 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 production . for double @xmath81 production our estimate is conservative , since we consider a cut in the momentum transfer @xmath9 ( @xmath82 gev@xmath67 ) and the soft pomeron contribution is not included in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the number of events is smaller than those obtained for a @xmath11 collider @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we still predict a large number of events related to double meson production in @xmath7 collisions , allowing future experimental analyses , even if the acceptance for vector meson detection were low . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we believe that this process could be used to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies .    as a summary , we have studied the double diffractive vector meson production in @xmath0 collisions assuming the dominance of the bfkl pomeron exchange and estimated the total cross sections for the future linear colliders . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that it may be possible to perform a sucessful experimental analysis of this process . </S>",
    "<S> it is an important results since , as already pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this exclusive diffractive reaction may become the best tool to investigate the perturbative picture of the bfkl pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we expect that in this process the impact of the nlo corrections can be evaluated and the various approaches proposed in the literature can be constrained . </S>"
