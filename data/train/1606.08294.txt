    "the accurate measurement of the reaction rates between different species of chemicals is a crucial component in the process of understanding and manipulating the biochemical processes which perpetuate or extinguish life @xcite .",
    "a common method of measuring these rates is via surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) @xcite .",
    "spr allows the binding dynamics between two species of chemicals to be measured in real time , and is performed by binding one of the two chemical species to a substrate ( the receptor species ) , and then measuring the change in index of refraction as the other chemical species ( the ligand species ) flows over the substrate and the two chemicals interact @xcite . see fig .",

    "ideally , the data from this experiment allows for the easy extraction of the binding and unbinding rates .",
    "however , in spr cells the rates of transport to the reaction surface can be quite slow relative to the reaction rates , i.e. , it may take much longer to diffusively transport down to the receptor surface than it does to bind to that surface , so the well - mixed assumption of first - order reaction kinetics may not necessarily be valid .",
    "the rate of transport to the reaction surface combines with the intrinsic reaction rates to create the effective reaction rates that are measured in an spr assay . in order to determine the intrinsic reaction rates the influence of the transport rate",
    "must be properly accounted for @xcite .",
    "most of the attempted approaches to the problem of decoupling the transport and reaction rates model the system with a deterministic process , where the dependence on the parameters of the spr system is governed by a set of coupled differential partial rate equations @xcite .",
    "simulations for spr systems are often derived from numerical solutions to these pdes , but these solutions often fail to capture the spatial and temporal correlations between the ligands and the receptors as they interact , and ignore statistical fluctuations @xcite .",

    "reaction rates derived from the standard mean - field model of the reaction kinetics will be compared with known intrinsic reaction rates used in the simulations in order to determine the degree to which spatio - temporal correlations and fluctuations are important to the dynamics of the system .",

    "the binding and unbinding of the ligands to the receptors cause the resonance energy of the surface plasmon waves in the gold substrate to change @xcite .",
    "this change in the energy of the waves can be measured by shining a p - polarized beam of light onto the substrate through a prism .",
    "the prism allows the momentum of the incident beam to be varied , and when the momentum of the incident beam and the surface plasmons of the gold substrate are the same , the beam and plasmons couple and create a surface plasmon polariton in the gold substrate .",
    "this coupling results in a decrease in energy of the reflected beam of light , and the momentum at which this occurs can be measured by recording the angle where the resonance between the incident beam and the surface plasmon appears .",
    "the change in resonance angle as a function of time can then be rescaled into a plot of bound ligand - receptor pairs as a function of time @xcite .      ]",
    "the experimental process of surface plasmon resonance is typically performed in two stages .",
    "first , the solution of ligands is allowed to flow over the receptor surface with a constant concentration of ligands and fixed flow velocity .",
    "the system is allowed to evolve in this state until a steady - state concentration of bound ligands is observed .",
