    "one of the common goals for first principles calculations is the comparison of energies , such as configurational energies , surface energies , mixing enthalpies or lattice stabilities .",
    "usually the comparison is limited to total energies .",
    "this is appropriate when the effects of temperature can be neglected . however , for many problems within physics , materials and earth sciences they are not negligible and gibbs free energy represents the proper thermodynamic potential when the temperature and pressure are external parameters .",
    "the quasiharmonic approximation can bridge the temperature gap , but there are cases where it falls short .",
    "strongly anharmonic systems are not described well@xcite , especially dynamically unstable systems .",
    "traditionally the problem of dynamical instability was addressed either by including more terms in the taylor expansion of the potential energy or via a self - consistent approach.@xcite    hooton@xcite realised that even though the second derivatives at the equilibrium positions are negative , the atoms in a solid rarely occupy these positions .",
    "they move in the effective potential of their non - stationary neighbours . by sampling the potential energy surface not at the equilibrium positions but at the most probable positions for a given temperature",
    "one can obtain a harmonic approximation that describes the system at elevated temperatures .",
    "the self - consistent formalism employs an iterative procedure@xcite by creating a harmonic potential , which is used to describe the thermal excitations that again give a new harmonic potential .",
    "this is then repeated until self - consistency .",
    "the double - time green s functions , developed by choquard,@xcite use a cumulant expansion in the higher order terms . although formally exact , this formalism requires knowledge of the higher order force constants .",
    "obtaining these accurately for something other than the structurally simple systems is computationally very demanding from first principles.@xcite    a recent implementation of the self - consistent formalism by souvatzis _ _ et al.__@xcite uses _ ab initio _ supercell calculations .",
    "a problem with this approach is that the excitations could only be done in the harmonic sense which means probing phase space with a limited basis set . where the harmonic approximation works well this is not a problem .",
    "when the harmonic approximation fails it is due to a strong anharmonic contribution .",
    "strongly anharmonic systems are by definition badly described with the harmonic approximation .",
    "several techniques use born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics to obtain anharmonic corrections to quasi - harmonic free energies.@xcite they focus on anharmonic corrections to materials that are well described in the quasiharmonic approximation , and the applicability to strongly anharmonic systems is questionable when the phonon renormalization due to increased temperature can not be described by a linear equation .",
    "we have developed a new method@xcite that is similar to hootons@xcite original idea , but with a foundation in ( ab initio ) molecular dynamics . in this paper",
    "we present a substantial refinement and generalization of the temperature dependent effective potential method ( tdep ) , showing how it deals with : a model one - dimensional anharmonic oscillator , a strongly anharmonic system , bcc zr , treated from first - principles , and @xmath0he modelled with the aziz _",

    "an aimd simulation will provide a set of displacements @xmath9 , forces @xmath10 and potential energies @xmath11 . we seek to minimize the difference in forces from aimd and our harmonic form ( @xmath12 ) at time step @xmath13 , summed over all time steps @xmath14 :",
    "@xmath15 this is realized with a a moore - penrose pseudoinverse @xmath16 to obtain the linear least squares solution for @xmath17 that minimize @xmath18 .",
    "this is then mapped to the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 are indices to atoms in a unit cell with @xmath21 atoms and @xmath22 cartesian indices .",
    "the pair vectors in the supercell @xmath23 are mapped to stars of lattice vectors @xmath24 connecting atoms of type @xmath25 and @xmath26 . from this form",
    "the phonon dispersion relations , free energy and all other quantities can be extracted .",
    "this direct implementation works well,@xcite but the numerical efficiency can be improved , as is demonstrated below .",
    "the form of the force constant matrices depends only on the supercell used in the aimd and the crystal lattice .",
    "we begin by populating the force constant matrices @xmath27 with unknown variables @xmath28 @xmath29 and so on , including vectors @xmath24 up to a cutoff determined by the size of the supercell .",
    "some of these @xmath28 are equivalent . to find out which , we look at the symmetry relations the force constant matrices have to obey .",
    "we have@xcite @xmath30 that stem , in order , from the facts that there is no net translation of the crystal , all bravais lattices have inversion symmetry , and that the order of the second derivatives does not matter .",
    "each relation will give us a few equations for the unknowns @xmath28 , reducing their number .",
    "in addition to these fundamental properties of the force constant matrices we can benefit from the symmetry of the lattice . if symmetry relation @xmath31 , belonging to the point group of the lattice , relates two vectors @xmath32 we have the following relation : @xmath33 by applying equations  the number of unknown variables is massively reduced .",
    "for example , a bcc lattice modelled as a @xmath34 supercell ( 128 atoms ) would have 147456 unknown variables in @xmath17 , if one does not consider symmetry arguments .",
    "application of eqs .",
    " reduces the problem to 11 unknown variables .",
    "having found the reduced problem with @xmath35 unknown variables , it can be substituted back into .",
    "the expression for the forces at timestep @xmath13 will schematically look like this : @xmath36 the actual distribution of the @xmath28 will depend on the problem at hand .",
    "carrying out the matrix product gives us a new set of equations for the forces @xmath37 where second sum describes the coefficients for each @xmath28 contained in the expression for force component @xmath38 .",
    "these coefficients are linear combinations of the displacement components @xmath39",
    ". the explicit form is determined by the lattice . in matrix form",
    "this is written as @xmath40 eq .",
    "[ eq : feqcphi ] is equivalent to eq .",
    "[ eq : big_fdu ] , it is just rewritten in terms of the symmetry inequivalent interactions .",
    "this implementation symbolically reduces the number of unknowns , generates the function that gives the matrix @xmath41 from a set of displacements @xmath42 and the mapping from the set of @xmath28 back to the force constant matrix @xmath27 .    to find @xmath43 we minimize the difference in forces between aimd simulations and the model hamiltonian @xmath44 this is again realised with the least squares solution for @xmath45 @xmath46 having determined @xmath45 we can substitute the components into the force constant matrix and proceed to calculate thermodynamic properties of the original ( real ) system .",
    "the suggested scheme is a superior way of using symmetry to improve the numerical accuracy .",
    "most schemes involving symmetry revolve around determining the interaction in one direction and then using the symmetry relations to translate and rotate that interaction .",
    "any numerical errors  which are always present  will propagate to all interactions , whereas in the present approach the errors will be averaged and should cancel each other to a large degree .    the advantage of this procedure will be illustrated below .",
    "( color online ) convergence of the free energy of bcc zr at 1300k with respect to the number of timesteps . in panel",
    "( a ) symmetry is treated numerically and in ( b ) it is treated in the novel analytical way .",
    "the same input data is used in both cases , and it converges to the same value , but we have improved the performance by several orders of magnitude . ]",
    "if the system has internal degrees of freedom for the structural relaxations , such as a crystal with point defects , an interface or a random alloy the atoms ideal positions and equilibrium positions do not coincide . while one could find the relaxed positions from 0k calculations , the equilibrium positions are by no means constant with respect to temperature .",
    "tdep handles this in an elegant way .",
    "note that we find the second order terms in with a least squares fit of the slope of force versus displacement .",
    "originally , the displacements could be calculated with respect to the wrong equilibrium positions that do not correspond to the temperature of the simulation .",
    "still our experience shows that slope will be the well approximated . that allows for the following procedure :    * guess equilibrium positions , usually the ideal lattice positions .",

    "are then used to move the atoms in a steepest descent scheme towards equilibrium positions .",
    "the whole process is repeated until convergence .",
    "our test shows that this procedure is remarkably stable .",
    "the second order force constants @xmath51 are weakly affected by the choice of equilibrium positions .",
    "the vibrational entropy and phonon dispersion relations are largely unaffected as well . eliminating the first order term , however , is formally important and crucial when extracting higher order terms .",
    "note that self - consistent iterations are numerically efficient , because the most time - consuming step for applications of tdep is md simulations , while their mapping on model hamiltonian represents post - processing of the md results with minimal computaional cost .",
    "we will begin by reiterating the traditional way how free energy is determined in the quasiharmonic approximation .",
    "divided into parts it will be @xmath52 where a division of the right hand side into parts makes a clear distinction between the electronic contribution @xmath53 and the vibrational contribution @xmath54 .",
    "the electronic contribution is divided into the total energy of the lattice , @xmath55 , and the electronic entropy @xmath56 .",
    "the vibrational contribution is divided into average kinetic @xmath57 and potential energy @xmath58 of the ions , vibrational entropy @xmath59 and zero point energy @xmath60 .",

    "is divided as @xmath63 were the potential energy @xmath64 is temperature dependent .",
    "since the ions move as classical particles the zero point energy is missing .",
    "there is unfortunately no information about the entropy , but through the force constant matrices obtained using tdep , the vibrational entropy and zero point energy can be estimated . for tdep to have an accurate free energy",
    "the potential energy should , on average , be equal to that of aimd .",
    "this would ensure that the full anharmonic @xmath65 is included .",
    "the problem is that @xmath64 is rapidly oscillating over time , requiring a long simulation time to converge . if we look at the tdep potential energy @xmath66 and recognise that it should model the thermal fluctuations of the original system we can overcome the numerical issues . setting the average potential energies equal , @xmath67 ,",
    "gives us @xmath68 by removing the thermal excitations of the harmonic form the fluctuations can be decreased by roughly an order of magnitude and the accuracy of @xmath6 is thus increased be the same amount . including higher order terms in the energy expansion would further serve to minimize these fluctuations .",

    "the formally exact method of thermodynamic integration@xcite can be used to determine the free energy .",
    "this method will determine the anharmonic correction to the free energy .",

    "the model tdep hamiltonian is constructed to describe the system as accurately as possible while retaining the harmonic form .",
    "it is then easy to argue that the anharmonic correction term @xmath72 should be small .",
    "while it is difficult to make general statements regarding this , our experience so far is that this correction is very small in every system we have tested .",
    "in addition , the thermodynamic integration technique can be numerically inefficient when high accuracy is needed . while one can accurately control the numerical accuracy@xcite the finite size effects are more difficult to control , especially in _ ab intio _ simulations . in fig .",

    "<S> the formalism and the numerical aspects of the technique are described in details . </S>",
    "<S> a number of practical examples are given , and results are presented , which confirm the usefulness of tdep within _ ab initio _ and classical molecular dynamics frameworks . in particular , we examine from first - principles the behavior of force constants upon the dynamical stabilization of body centered phase of zr , and show that they become more localized . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate phase diagram for @xmath0he modeled with the aziz _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ potential and obtain results which are in favorable agreement both with respect to experiment and established techniques . </S>"
