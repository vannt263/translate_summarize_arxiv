    "it is generally believed that qcd exhibits a rich phase structure in an extreme environment such as at high temperature and high baryon chemical potential . for the chiral phase transition ,",
    "it is a widely accepted view that the critical point(s ) ( i.e.  the end point of the first - order phase boundary ) should exist at finite temperature and density .",
    "recently , a schematic @xmath0-@xmath1 phase diagram with one critical point was extensively adopted in the literature@xcite .    in the last decade",
    "the color - superconducting ( csc ) phase has attracted a lot of theoretical interest and prompted extensive studies of dense and cold quark matter  @xcite . at asymptotically high density that justifies the perturbative qcd calculations ,",
    "the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite has been established as the ground state of quark matter . for the intermediate density region which may exist in the core of a compact star ,",
    "the nonperturbative features of qcd play a more important role in the phase structure of qcd , and both cfl and non - cfl csc phases may appear in this region",
    ".    the possible emergence of a cfl or a non - cfl csc phase around the chiral transition boundary at low temperatures should affect the chiral phase transition , and hence the interplay between the chiral condensate and the diquark condensate may result in an unexpected phase structure of qcd .",
    "such an example was first presented in  @xcite in a two - flavor nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with the vector interaction included : it was found that the repulsive vector interaction can lead to a two - critical - point structure in the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase diagram of qcd , which is due to the fact that the density - density correlation induced by the vector interaction effectively enhances the competition between the chiral and diquark correlations while weakening the first - order chiral restoration@xcite .",
    "we note that the renormalization - group analysis  @xcite , the chiral instanton@xmath2anti - instanton molecule model  @xcite , and the truncated dyson - schwinger model of qcd  @xcite all support the existence of the vector - vector four - quark interaction",
    ". the vector - vector interaction may be responsible for the vacuum properties of vector mesons in low - energy effective theories of qcd@xcite .    in a quite different context",
    ", a realization of a similar two - critical - point structure of the qcd phase diagram has been recently conjectured  @xcite : that is , the @xmath3-breaking vertex may induce a new critical point .",
    "this conjecture is based on a general ginzburg - landau theory constrained by qcd symmetries .",
    "there , the three - flavor anomaly term generates the cubic coupling between the chiral and diquark condensates .",
    "it has been argued that the resultant crossover of chiral restoration at small temperatures embodies the hadron - quark continuity hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "further investigation is necessary to clarify whether the new critical point really exists or not with reasonable parameter . beside the above two cases , another mechanism which can induce multiple critical - point structure",
    "was demonstrated in  @xcite , where it was first disclosed that the positive electric chemical potential @xmath4 required by the charge - neutrality constraint plays a similar role as the repulsive vector interaction on the chiral phase transition in a four - quark interaction model : in a simple two - flavor njl model , the same two - critical - point structure found in  @xcite was obtained .",
    "in addition , positive @xmath4 also represents the magnitude of disparity between fermi spheres of u and d quarks when taking into account the local charge - neutrality constraint . for an asymmetric homogeneous system including two different flavor quarks with the mismatched fermi spheres , the energy gap of the cooper pairing between these two - flavor quarks can increase with temperature .",
    "this unusual behavior of the energy gap is due to the smearing of the fermi surface by temperature .",
    "for the two - flavor neutral csc phase , this unconventional thermal behavior of the diquark condensate can lead to a special competition between the chiral condensate and the diquark condensate , which may be enhanced with increasing temperature . for some model parameter regions ,",
    "this abnormal competition induced by @xmath4 can result in a nontrivial three - critical - point phase structure  @xcite .",
    "the competition of two order parameters with the external constraint(s ) should also suggest a general mechanism for a realization of a multiple critical - point structure , which may have some implications to study the phase transitions in condensed matter physics .",
    "note , however , that a very simple two - flavor njl model with only scalar quark - antiquark and diquark interaction was used in ref .",
    "@xcite : if the model produces a relatively large vacuum quark mass , no multiple critical points appear in such formalism even though the charge - neutral constraint is taken into account for the csc phase . for a more realistic situation , both the vector interaction and the strange quark degree of freedom should be taken into account . because in the chiral phase transition similar roles are played by the repulsive vector interaction and the electric chemical potential under the neutrality constraint",
    ", one can expect that the chiral restoration will be weakened more significantly when simultaneously taking into account both the ingredients . in this case",
    ", it is possible that the multiple critical point structures shown in @xcite will become more robust , which we will show in the present work . in addition , for the neutral quark matter system , because of the quark density discrepancy , the vector interaction should also give different contributions to the dynamical chemical potentials for u and d quarks .",
    "this may have important influence on the property of the asymmetric homogeneous csc phase which suffers from the so called chromomagnetic instability characterized by the negative meissner mass squared @xcite .",
    "this is a significant observation and will be shown to be the case in the following sections .",
    "there have been extensive studies within the njl model on the phase diagram of dense and locally neutral three - flavor quark matter with strange quarks explicitly included @xcite : in the strong coupling case , the chiral breaking phase at low temperature is bordered by the 2csc phase , while for the weak coupling case it is surrounded by both normal quark matter and a gapless phase called g2csc . however , no new critical point was found in  @xcite , in contrast to the result reported in  @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that the vector interaction was not included in  @xcite , and hence only a strong first - order chiral restoration happened in the low temperature region .",
    "we can expect that the qualitative feature of the phase diagram , even for the three - flavor quark matter reported in  @xcite , may change when the repulsive vector interaction is taken into account together with the charge - neutrality constraint .",
    "again , we shall see that this is actually the case , and there appear multiple critical points in the phase diagram of three - flavor quark matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "a nonlocal two - flavor njl model is used to investigate the @xmath5 phase structure of qcd , with both vector interaction and charge - neutrality being taken into account .",
    "the extension of the work to the two - plus - one - flavor case with the so - called kobayashi - maskawa-t hooft(kmt ) term@xciteis presented in sec.iii .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "we will demonstrate the joint effect of the vector interaction and neutral electric - charge constraint on the qcd phase diagram within a nonlocal two - flavor njl model .",
    "njl - type models have been extensively used to investigate the csc phase transition at moderate and large densities  @xcite : see the previous study without the csc  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a njl model is that it can investigate the interplay between the chiral condensate , the diquark condensate and the quark number density on the same footing .",
    "for the two - flavor case , a nonlocal njl model @xcite is adopted here , which has the lagrangian density , @xmath6-g_v \\sum_{i=0}^3\\left [ \\left ( \\bar{q}(x ) \\gamma^\\mu",

    "the three coupling constants , namely @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , belong to the scalar mesonic channel , the vector mesonic channel , and the diquark channel , respectively .",
    "the current quark mass matrix is given by @xmath12 in two flavors , and we shall work in the isospin symmetric limit with @xmath13 .",
    "we note that @xmath14 s are the antisymmetric gell - mann matrices ( i.e.  @xmath15 runs over @xmath16 only ) for the color su(3 ) group , while @xmath17 and the @xmath18 s are the unit matrix and pauli matrices in flavor space , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the scalar interaction , the vector part has @xmath19 flavor symmetry , and hence the vector terms can be decomposed into @xmath20 without the flavor mixing term like @xmath21 , although there are terms like @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to the local njl model , lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian2f ] ) is formulated with a nonlocal interaction , which is controlled by a form factor @xmath23 .",
    "this type of model can be considered as a special case of the truncated dyson - schwinger equation with a separable effective gluon propagator or an instantaneous nonlocal chiral quark model .",
    "the main purpose of adopting such a nonlocal interaction model in our study is to deal with the one - loop ultraviolet divergence , especially for the calculation of the meissner mass squared at finite temperature @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we follow the model parametrization in @xcite and use the so - called lorentzian form factor with the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fourier transformation of the form factor @xmath23 . in eq.([formfactor ] ) , @xmath26 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath27 stands for the scale parameter of the model . to check the sensitivity of the main results on the model parameter choice ,",

    "the other three model parameters , namely @xmath27 , @xmath9 and @xmath29 , are determined by the vacuum physical quantities of the pion mass @xmath30 , the pion decay constant @xmath31 , and the quark condensate @xmath32 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in general , there exist nine possible two - quark condensates for the two - plus - one - flavor case with the lagrangian  ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) : three chiral condensates @xmath34 , three diquark condensates @xmath35 , and three vector quark condensates @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 range from 1 to 3 , which stand for three flavors and three colors , respectively . at the mean - field level , the thermodynamic potential for the two - plus - one - flavor njl model including the charge - neutrality constraints , is @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for the contribution from free leptons .",
    "note that , for consistency , @xmath40 should include the contributions from both electrons and muons . since @xmath41 and @xmath42 , ignoring the contribution from muons has little effect on the phase structure .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath40 given by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ omega - l ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed here that , for simplicity , the contributions of the cubic mixing terms among three different condensates , such as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , are neglected in eq .",
    "( [ omega2 ] ) .",
    "these terms arise from the kmt interaction which may or may not affect the phase structure . in particular it was argued in  @xcite that the cubic mixing term between chiral and diquark condensates may play an important role in the chiral phase transition in the low temperature region . beside the direct contribution of these cubic terms to the thermodynamic potential , the flavor mixing terms arising from the kmt interaction also have influence on the dispersion relationship of quasiquarks .",
    "for example , both the diquark condensate and the quark number density contribute to the dynamical quark mass .",
    "therefore , it is a very interesting topic to investigate the possible effect of these cubic coupling terms on the phase diagram by using dynamic models of qcd . leaving the discussion of this interesting problem to our future work , here",
    "we just simply assume that none of these mixing terms makes a qualitative difference in the phase diagram .",
    "because of the large mass disparity between the strange quark and the u ( d ) quark , the favored phase at low temperature and moderate density might be 2csc phase rather than cfl as demonstrated in the two - plus - one - flavor njl model@xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that the strange quark mass is close to or even larger than @xmath1 near the chiral boundary , which means that the strange quark density is considerably smaller than that of the u and d quarks .",
    "therefore , for the two - plus - one - flavor case , the light quarks still play the dominant role around the chiral boundary , and the density mismatch between u and d quarks under the electric - charge - neutrality constraint is still similar to the two - flavor case . since the main purpose of our study is to investigate the influence of the neutral csc phase on the chiral phase transition by taking into account the vector interaction , we only consider the 2csc phase in the following .",
    "the inverse quark propagator in the 2csc phase in the two - plus - one - flavor case still takes the same form as @xmath46 , with the extended matrixes @xmath47 and @xmath48 in three - flavor space .",
    "the constituent quark mass is given by @xmath49 and the effective quark chemical potentials take the form @xmath50 the quantity @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) still has the same form as eq.([average ] ) [ eq.([mismatch ] ) ] with @xmath53 .",
    "ignoring the mass difference between the u quark and the d quark ( the mass difference is very small @xcite ) , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ omega2 ] ) has an analytical form which greatly simplifies the numerical calculation . adopting the variational method",
    ", we get the eight nonlinear coupling equations @xmath54 since @xmath55 is near zero around the chiral transition region @xcite , taking it to zero makes little difference in the calculational result and the nonlinear equations can be reduced to 7 .",
    "similar to the two - flavor case , the vector interaction @xmath56 is also taken as a free parameter in the following , and the diquark coupling @xmath57 is fixed to the standard value . because of the contribution from the kmt interaction , the ratio @xmath57 from fierz transformation should be 0.95 rather than 0.75 when only considering the four - quark interaction @xcite .",
    "note that in this case the effective four - quark interaction which determines the quark constituent mass in vacuum is @xmath58 , and the standard value of @xmath59 should be 0.75 .",
    "the phase diagrams with a multiple critical - point structure for different vector interactions are shown in fig.[fig : pd-3flavor ] .",
    "one can see that these phase diagrams are very similar to fig.[fig : pdset2 ] , the two - flavor case with parameter set 2 .",
    "this is reasonable since these two models almost reproduce the same constituent quark ( u and d ) masses and have similar scale parameters .",
    "figure[fig : pd-3flavor ] indicates that the kmt interaction does not change the possible multiple critical - point structures for the chiral phase transition .    for simplicity ,",
    "the unstable regions with chromomagnetic instability are not plotted in fig.[fig : pd-3flavor ] .",
    "the calculation of the meissner mass squared in the 2csc phase for the two - plus - one - flavor case is straightforward but complicated .",
    "including the s quark should have little effect on the value of the meissner masses calculated according to the formula for the two - flavor case @xcite since the s quark does not take part in cooper pairing .",
    "we can expect that the critical points e , f , and g should still be free from the chromomagnetic instability , as in figs.[fig : pdset1 ] and [ fig : pdset2 ] , since the large strange quark may give a positive contribution rather than a negative one to the meissner masses squared .",
    "as for critical point h , it may be located in the unstable region and could be safe from the instability because the relatively large @xmath56 may suppress the unstable region to lower @xmath0 and higher @xmath1 .    usually , it is argued that the instantons should be screened at large chemical potential and temperature .",
    "therefore , compared to it s vacuum value , the coupling constant @xmath60 is expected to be reduced around the chiral boundary . for smaller @xmath60 ,",
    "the flavor mixing effect is suppressed and the mass mismatch between the s quark and the u(d ) quark becomes larger .",
    "accordingly , the influence of the s quark on the chiral restoration is weakened , and the situation approaches the two - flavor case . on the other hand , with decreasing @xmath60 , the u(d ) quark mass also decreases since the contribution from the s quark mass",
    "is reduced .",
    "this means the first - order chiral restoration will be weakened when decreasing @xmath60 .",
    "correspondingly , the coe region should be more easily formed with the influence of the vector interaction and the neutral csc phase , which favors the multiple critical - point structures or crossover for chiral restoration at low temperature .",
    "of course , the produced u(d ) quark vacuum constituent masses with different model parameters of the two - plus - one - flavor njl model may range from 300 - 400 mev , which are all phenomenologically acceptable just as the two - flavor case .",
    "then , one can expect that all the critical - point structures found in sec .",
    "[ sec : two flavor ] should also appear in the two - plus - one - flavor case , even considering the axial anomaly interaction term .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the effect of the repulsive vector - vector interaction combined with electric - charge neutrality in @xmath61 equilibrium on the chiral phase and csc phase transitions within both two - flavor and two - plus - one - flavor njl models .",
    "for the two - flavor case with the presence of the neutral csc phase , we demonstrated that , with the help of the repulsive vector interaction , there always exists a parameter window in the njl models which favors the appearance of a multiple chiral critical - point structure for a wide range of the vacuum quark mass , i.e. , from 300 mev to 400 mev .",
    "besides the two- and three - critical - points structures found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , we have shown for the first time that a four - critical - points structure of the qcd phase diagram can be realized ; such a multiple critical - point structure is caused by the joint effect of positive @xmath4 and @xmath10 . because the dynamical strange quark mass is still relatively large near the boundary of the chiral transition , the multiple critical - point structures present in the two - flavor case also appear in the two - plus - one - flavor case . for the intermediate diquark coupling case , the number of critical points changes as @xmath62 with an increasing vector coupling in the two - plus - one - flavor njl model . in general",
    ", one can expect that different model parameters may possibly give other order of the number of the critical points as the vector coupling is increased .",
    "although our analysis is based on a low - energy effective model which inherently has , more or less , a parameter dependence , we have seen that the physical mechanism to realize the multiple critical - point structure is solely dependent on the basic ingredients of the effective quark dynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "therefore , we believe that the results obtained in the present work should be taken seriously and examined in other effective models of qcd , or hopefully lattice qcd simulations .",
    "our result also has a meaningful implication for the study of phase transitions in condensed matter physics .",
    "that means some external constraints enforced on the system can lead to the formation or expansion of the coexisting phase , and the competition between two order parameters can give rise to multiple critical points .",
    "last but not least , we emphasize that we have shown for the first time that the repulsive vector interaction which should generically exist between the quarks does suppress the chromomagnetic instability related to the asymmetric homogeneous 2csc phase . with increasing vector interaction , the unstable region associated with chromomagnetic instability shrinks towards lower temperatures and higher chemical potentials .",
    "this means that the vector interaction can partially or even totally resolve the chromomagnetic instability problem .",
    "note that to cure the chromomagnetic instability , inhomogeneous asymmetric color superconductivity phases such as the loff phase and the gluonic phase were proposed in the literature . for the inhomogeneous phase , beside the condensate @xmath63 , there is no reason to rule out the appearance of another new condensate , @xmath64 , when considering the vector interaction .",
    "the effect of both the timelike vector condensate and the spacelike condensate on the asymmetric inhomogeneous csc phase will be reported in our future work@xcite .",
