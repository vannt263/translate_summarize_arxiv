    "recently , the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera presented data on the differential cross section @xmath5 of inclusive @xmath0 production in low-@xmath6 @xmath4 collisions , equivalent to photoproduction . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the rapidity and transverse momentum of the produced @xmath0 mesons in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "these measurements extended up to @xmath9  gev .",
    "another source of information on @xmath0 production comes from @xmath10 at the @xmath11-boson resonance @xcite . in this process ,",
    "two mechanisms of @xmath0 production contribute with similar rates .",
    "the @xmath0 mesons are either produced by @xmath12 decay and subsequent @xmath13 fragmentation , or by @xmath14 decay with subsequent fragmentation of @xmath15 quarks into @xmath16 mesons , which weakly decay into @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the latter two - step process is usually treated as a one - step fragmentation process @xmath17 . with the aid of very efficient bottom - tagging methods",
    ", these two main sources of inclusive @xmath0 production were disentangled with high purity , and separate cross sections for the two production mechanisms were presented .",
    "this allows one to determine separate fragmentation functions ( ff s ) for @xmath13 and @xmath17 . owing to the factorization theorem ,",
    "these can then be used to make quantitative predictions for @xmath0 production in other reactions such as @xmath18 , which is being measured at hera .",
    "such a program , which constitutes a test of the universality of the @xmath0 ff s , was recently carried out by two groups @xcite .",
    "these works are based on the so - called massless - charm scheme @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the charm - quark mass @xmath19 is neglected , except in the initial conditions for the parton density functions ( pdf s ) and the ff s of the charm quarks .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation for center - of - mass ( cm ) energies @xmath20 in @xmath2 annihilation or transverse momenta @xmath21 in @xmath22 scattering . in this approach",
    ", charm is considered to be one of the active flavors inside the initial photons and protons , in the same way as the lighter @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 quarks .",
    "then , the collinear singularities which correspond to the @xmath26 terms , where @xmath27 is an appropriate factorization scale ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) , in a scheme where the charm quark is treated as a massive particle and only three active flavors are taken into account are absorbed into the charm - quark pdf s and ff s . instead of absorbing the logarithmic terms",
    ", one can start with @xmath30 and absorb the initial- and final - state collinear singularities as usual in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath1 ) factorization scheme , based on dimensional regularization .",
    "these two possibilities to achieve a massless - charm result , _",
    "i.e. _ , to absorb the collinear singularities either in the form of logarithms or in the form of @xmath31 poles via @xmath1 factorization , differ by finite terms , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of @xmath32 .",
    "these terms can be considered as perturbative ff s at the low initial scale @xmath33 of order @xmath19 , which are evolved to higher scales with the usual altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equations @xcite . along these lines ,",
    "cross sections for @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath35 @xcite collisions were calculated in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , describing this way the transformation of a massless charm quark into a massive charm quark via a perturbative qcd cascade .",
    "later , this approach was extended by including a nonperturbative ff which describes the transition from the massive charm quark and antiquark to the @xmath0 mesons @xcite . in our earlier works on @xmath0 production @xcite , instead of working with the perturbative ff s , we incorporated their effect by an equivalent modification of the pure @xmath1 scheme with massless quarks , which led to a particular kind of massive subtraction scheme .",
    "this change of scheme was restricted to the final state .    after fitting the nonperturbative fragmentation component to the @xmath2 data taken by argus @xcite and opal @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite and to those taken by aleph @xcite and opal @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions as measured by h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite could be reasonably well described .",
    "in particular , not only the shape , but also the normalization of the cross section was very well accounted for @xcite .",
    "these papers showed that , in order to successfully predict inclusive @xmath0 production in low-@xmath6 @xmath4 collisions , it is essential to incorporate information on the fragmentation process from other reactions and to use the very same factorization scheme for all considered processes .",
    "the fragmentation of charm or bottom quarks into @xmath0 mesons can not be calculated from first principles in perturbative qcd .",
    "in fact , in order to realistically describe the formation of the @xmath0 mesons , a nonperturbative component , which is not known theoretically , is always needed .",
    "hence , it is certainly appropriate to give up the perturbative component of the ff input altogether and to describe the @xmath13 and @xmath17 transitions entirely by nonperturbative ff s , as is usually done for the fragmentation of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 quarks into light mesons .    the aim of the present work is to reconsider the production of @xmath0 mesons both in @xmath2 annihilation and photoproduction adopting this puristic approach of fully nonperturbative fragmentation in the @xmath1 scheme with five massless flavors .",
    "this analysis is based on very recent high - statistics data from the opal @xcite and aleph @xcite collaborations at lep1 .",
    "the ff s thus fitted are then used to update our predictions for the cross section of @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions to be compared with new data from the zeus collaboration @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we briefly recall the theoretical framework underlying the extraction of ff s from @xmath2 data , which has already been introduced in refs .",
    "then , we present the ff s we obtained by fitting the new @xmath0 data from opal @xcite and aleph @xcite at leading order ( lo ) and nlo in the pure @xmath1 factorization scheme with five massless flavors . in sec .  3 , we apply the nonperturbative parameters determined in sec .  2 to make lo and nlo predictions for @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions , which we then compare with the latest zeus data @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "our procedure to construct lo and nlo sets of @xmath0 ff s has already been described in our previous paper @xcite . here , we only give those details which differ from ref .  @xcite . as experimental input ,",
    "we now use the new lep1 data from opal @xcite and aleph @xcite .",
    "while the older aleph @xcite and opal data @xcite agreed well enough to be simultaneously fitted @xcite , the new data samples do not sufficiently overlap .",
    "thus , we refrain from performing a combined fit . instead , we generate independent lo and nlo ff sets for the two data samples .",
    "this allows us to check actually how well our predictions for other @xmath0-production cross sections are constrained by the available information from @xmath2 annihilation , an error source which has so far been rather difficult to assess quantitatively .    in @xmath2 annihilation at the @xmath11-boson resonance , charmed mesons are produced either directly through the hadronization of charm quarks produced by @xmath12 or via the weak decays of @xmath16 hadrons from @xmath14 , with an approximately equal rate .",
    "charmed mesons from @xmath12 allow us to determine the charm - quark ff .",
    "the main achievement of both experimental analyses @xcite was to disentangle these two main sources of @xmath0 production at the @xmath11-boson resonance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a combination of several charm - quark tagging methods , based on fully and partially reconstructed @xmath0 mesons , and a bottom - quark tag , based on identified electrons and muons , was used . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the separation of @xmath36 and @xmath37 events was improved by means of an algorithm based on the measurement of the impact parameter of charged tracks and the effective mass of those least fitted to the primary vertex . as in the earlier analyses @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 mesons were identified via the decay chain @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( and the analogous chain for the @xmath40 meson ) , which allows for a particularly clean signal reconstruction .",
    "the experimental cross sections @xcite were presented as distributions differential in @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the measured energy of the @xmath0 candidate , which are normalized to the total number of multihadronic @xmath11-boson decays . besides the total @xmath0 yield , which receives contributions from @xmath12 and @xmath14 decays as well as from gluon fragmentation , both experimental groups separately specified results for @xmath0 mesons from tagged @xmath14 events .",
    "the contribution due to charm - quark fragmentation is peaked at large @xmath43 , whereas the one due to bottom - quark fragmentation has its maximum at small @xmath43 .",
    "for the fits , we use the @xmath43 bins in the interval @xmath44 $ ] and integrate the theoretical functions over the bin widths , which is equivalent to the experimental binning procedure . as in the experimental analyses , we sum over @xmath45 and @xmath40 mesons . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no difference between the ff s of a given quark and its antiquark . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the starting scales for the @xmath0 ff s of the gluon and the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath46 quarks and antiquarks to be @xmath47 , while we take @xmath48 for the ff s of the @xmath49 quark and antiquark .",
    "the ff s of the gluon and the first three flavors are assumed to be zero at the starting scale .",
    "these ff s are generated through the @xmath50 evolution , and the ff s of the first three quarks and antiquarks coincide with each other at all scales @xmath27 .",
    "we employ two different forms for the parameterization of the charm- and bottom - quark ff s at their respective starting scales . in the case of charm",
    ", we use the peterson distribution @xcite , @xmath51 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] in the case of bottom , we adopt the ansatz @xmath52 which is frequently used for the ff s of light hadrons .",
    "however , in contrast to the light - hadron case , we expect that @xmath53 for @xmath0 mesons , so that @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , we expect that @xmath56 , since @xmath57 is supposed to have its maximum somewhere at @xmath58 .",
    "this choice of starting distributions was also used for the mixed set ( m ) in ref .",
    "the peterson form is particularly suitable for ff s that peak at large @xmath43 .",
    "since the bottom - quark ff , being a convolution of the @xmath59 fragmentation and the subsequent @xmath60 decay , has its maximum at small @xmath43 values , we obtain intolerably bad fits if we also use eq .",
    "( [ peterson ] ) in this case . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also studied the alternative where eq .",
    "( [ standard ] ) is used both for the charm and bottom quarks , leading to the standard set ( s ) .",
    "although set s yielded slightly lower @xmath61 values per degree of freedom ( @xmath62 ) at the expense of having one more fit parameter , both sets , s and m , led to almost identical predictions for @xmath0 photoproduction in the kinematical regions of present interest at hera . in this work ,",
    "we thus limit ourselves to the mixed ansatz .",
    "this facilitates the comparison of our results , especially on @xmath3 , with the literature on charm - quark fragmentation , where the peterson ansatz  ( [ peterson ] ) is commonly used .",
    "ansatz  ( [ standard ] ) was also employed some time ago in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the nonperturbative ff s of charm quarks into @xmath63 and @xmath64 mesons and those of bottom quarks into @xmath16 mesons .",
    "the calculation of the cross section @xmath65 for @xmath66 is performed as described in ref .",

    "both opal @xcite and aleph @xcite presented momentum distributions for their full @xmath0 samples and for their @xmath14 subsamples .",

    "@xcite , we need to include the additional factor @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the fraction of @xmath37 events in the sample which remains after subtracting the events from gluon splitting ; this factor may be extracted from ref .",
    "the aleph data @xcite have slightly smaller statistical errors than the opal data @xcite .    as for the asymptotic scale parameter appropriate for five active quark flavors ,",
    "we adopt the lo ( nlo ) value @xmath75  mev ( 227  mev ) from our study of inclusive charged - pion and -kaon production @xcite .",
    "the particular choice of @xmath76 is not essential ; other values , in particular higher lo values of @xmath76 , can easily be accommodated by slightly shifting the other fit parameters without changing the quality of the fit . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the charm- and bottom - quark masses to be @xmath77  gev and @xmath78  gev , respectively . since @xmath19 and @xmath79",
    "only enter via the definitions of the starting scales @xmath33 of the ff s , their precise values are immaterial for our fit .",

    "[ fit ] , we list three @xmath62 values for each of these four fits : one for the @xmath14 subsample ; one for the total sample ( sum of @xmath36-tagged , @xmath37-tagged , and gluon - splitting events ) ; and the average evaluated by taking into account both the @xmath14 subsample and the total sample .",
    "we observe that all four fits are quite successful , with @xmath62 values of order unity .",
    "the lo and nlo fits to the opal data are slightly better than those to the aleph data . in each case",
    ", the @xmath14 subsample tends to be less well described by the fit than the total sample .",
    "as expected on general grounds , the nlo fits are superior to the lo fits .    in fig .",
    "[ ee]a , we compare the opal data @xcite with the lo and nlo calculations using sets lo  o and nlo  o , respectively . the analogous analysis for the aleph data @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "notice that the distributions plotted in figs .",
    "[ ee]a and b correspond to @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the experimental data are multiplied by the factors specified above . except at very small @xmath43 , the lo and nlo results are very similar .",
    "this is also true for the distributions at the starting scale , as may be seen by comparing the corresponding lo and nlo parameters in table  [ pars ] .",
    "only @xmath3 changes appreciably as we pass from lo to nlo .",
    "the branching of the lo and nlo results at small @xmath43 indicates that , in this region , the perturbative treatment ceases to be valid .",
    "this is related to the phase - space boundary for the production of @xmath0 mesons at @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the @xmath0 mass . at @xmath85 ,",
    "one has @xmath86 .",
    "this is approximately where our nlo results turn negative .",
    "since our massless - quark approach is not expected to be valid in regions of phase space where finite-@xmath84 effects are important , our results should only be considered meaningful for @xmath87 , say .",
    "we also encountered a similar small-@xmath43 behaviour in our previous analysis @xcite , where we fitted the older aleph @xcite and opal @xcite data in the framework of the massive subtraction scheme . since the two rightmost data points of the aleph @xmath14 sample , corresponding to the @xmath43 bins @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] , come with negative cross sections and rather small errors @xcite , we excluded them from our fits .    comparing figs .",
    "[ ee]a and b , we observe that the opal and aleph data are indeed somewhat different in shape and do not mutually overlap within their errors .",
    "thus , combined lo and nlo fits would lead to intolerable values of @xmath90 . by the same token , the separate fits to the opal and aleph data lead to significantly different values for the parameters appearing in the starting distributions ( [ peterson ] ) and ( [ standard ] ) , as may be seen from table  [ pars ]",
    ". there are also striking differences between the parameters resulting from the lo and nlo fits to the same data sets .",
    "the value @xmath91 of set lo  o is very similar to the value @xmath92 of set lo  m in our previous analysis @xcite . on the other hand , our new nlo results for @xmath3 , namely 0.116 for set nlo  o and 0.185 for set",
    "nlo  a , are significantly larger than our previous value 0.0204 for set nlo  m @xcite .",
    "this dramatic shift in @xmath3 is due to the fact that we are now using a different scheme for the factorization of the final - state collinear singularities ( namely , the pure @xmath1 scheme with five massless flavors ) than in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we modified this scheme so as to incorporate the effect of the perturbative ff s @xcite ( massive subtraction scheme ) .",
    "one important advantage of our new approach becomes apparent if we compare figs .",
    "[ ee]a and b with figs .",
    "1b and 2b in ref .",

    "@xcite . while in the nlo analyses of refs .",
    "@xcite , the nlo cross section of @xmath10 turned negative for @xmath93 , the new nlo calculation stays positive in the upper @xmath43 range , coincides there with the lo calculation , and nicely describes the data .",
    "we attribute the unphysical large-@xmath43 behaviour of the nlo calculation in refs .",
    "@xcite to the use of the massive subtraction scheme in conjunction with the special forms for the nonperturbative ff s at the starting scale .",
    "this led to the appearance of large sudakov logarithms which spoiled the nlo result at @xmath93 .",
    "this feature forced us @xcite , and also the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , to exclude from the fits the rather precise experimental data points at @xmath43 close to unity .",
    "by contrast , the nlo calculation in the pure @xmath1 scheme does not suffer from theoretical problems at high @xmath43 , and there is no need to omit valuable experimental information in that region .    as mentioned above",
    ", we take the ff s of the partons @xmath94 to be vanishing at their starting scale @xmath47 .",
    "however , these ff s are generated via the ap evolution to the high scale @xmath28 .",
    "thus , apart from the ff s of the heavy quarks @xmath95 , also these radiatively generated ff s contribute to the cross section .",
    "all these contributions are properly included in the total result for @xmath65 shown in figs .",
    "[ ee]a and b. at lep1 energies , the contribution from the first three quark flavors is still negligible ; it is concentrated at small @xmath43 , and only amounts to a few percent of the integrated cross section . however , the contribution from the gluon ff , which appears at nlo in connection with three - parton final states , is numerically significant .",
    "motivated by the decomposition of @xmath65 in terms of parton - level cross sections ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in figs .",
    "[ ee]a and b , we distributed this contribution over the @xmath12 and @xmath14 channels in the proportion @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the effective electroweak coupling of the quark @xmath98 to the @xmath11 boson and the photon including propagator adjustments .",
    "this procedure approximately produces the quantities that should be compared with the opal and aleph data .",
    "we ignore the effect of electromagnetic initial - state radiation , which has not been corrected for in the data .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we study the branching fractions for the transitions of charm and bottom quarks to @xmath0 mesons , defined by @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this allows us to test the consistency of our fits with information presented in the experimental papers @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the omitted region @xmath102 is close to zero .",
    "for all four ff sets , we calculate @xmath103 at the respective threshold @xmath104 and at the @xmath11-boson resonance @xmath105 and present the outcome in table  [ branching ] . as expected , the values of @xmath103 change very little under the evolution from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , and they are very similar for @xmath100 .",
    "the opal analysis @xcite , which is conceptually very different from ours , yielded @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where the first ( second ) error is statistical ( systematic ) .",
    "these values lie in the same ball park as our corresponding lo - o and nlo - o results in table  [ branching ] .",
    "the aleph paper @xcite does not explicitly quote values for these branching fractions .",
    "however , by combining other results given in section  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we infer that @xmath110 , which nicely agrees with our corresponding lo - a and nlo - a results in table  [ branching ] .",
    "another quantity of interest , which can directly be compared with experiment , is the mean momentum fraction , @xmath111 where @xmath100 . in table",

    "@xcite , the lo - s ( nlo - s ) result for @xmath115 turned out to be 6% ( 4% ) larger than the lo - m ( nlo - m ) result . at this point , we should also mention that the results in eq .",

    "whether this is the actual source of the difference remains unclear for the time being .",

    "the zeus data @xcite come as three distributions : ( i ) the @xmath8 distribution @xmath141 integrated over @xmath142 and 115  gev@xmath129  gev ; ( ii ) the @xmath7 distribution @xmath143 integrated over 4  gev@xmath144  gev and 115  gev@xmath129  gev ; and ( iii ) the @xmath145 distribution @xmath146 integrated over 4  gev@xmath144  gev and @xmath142 . in figs .",
    "[ zeus]a  c , we compare the measured distributions ( i)(iii ) with our lo and nlo predictions based on ff sets lo  o , lo  a , nlo  o , and nlo  a. in all three cases , the lo - o ( nlo - o ) result slightly exceeds the lo - a ( nlo - a ) result , but the differences are still small compared to the experimental uncertainty of the zeus data .",
    "this means that the details of charm fragmentation are sufficiently well constrained by the lep1 data , and that the hera data are not yet precise enough to resolve the presently existing difference between the opal @xcite and aleph @xcite data . in figs .",
    "[ zeus]a  c , the shifts due to use of different experimental input ( opal versus aleph ) tend to be less significant than the effects due to the inclusion of higher - order corrections ( lo versus nlo ) .",
    "however , the differences between the lo and nlo results are still considerably smaller than the errors on the zeus data , and they are approximately equal for the opal and aleph sets .",
    "the similarity of the lo and nlo results indicates good perturbative stability .",
    "apparently , this is a special virtue of the pure @xmath1 factorization scheme with strictly massless quark flavors , which we are using here .",
    "by contrast , we encountered a sizeable gap between the lo and nlo results in the massive subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "[ zeus]a , the nlo distributions fall off slightly less strongly with increasing @xmath8 than the lo ones , and thus agree better with the data at large @xmath8 . the overall agreement with the data",
    "is very satisfactory , even at small @xmath8 , where the massless approach ceases to be valid .",
    "the theoretical predictions somewhat undershoot the measurement in the highest @xmath8 bin , but the experimental error is still rather sizeable there . as for fig .",
    "[ zeus]b , the effect of the higher - order corrections and the influence of the experimental input is most pronounced in the backward direction , where all theoretical predictions agree with the experimental data within one standard deviation . at @xmath147 ,",
    "the nlo - o result exceeds the lo - o one by 25% and the nlo - a one by 15% . on the other hand , in the forward direction",
    ", at @xmath148 , the zeus data points significantly overshoot the theoretical predictions .",
    "there , the experimental errors are largest , while the theoretical uncertainty is relatively small .",
    "in fact , both the nlo corrections and the uncertainty due to spread of the lep1 data are negligibly small there . furthermore , we know from ref .",
    "@xcite that the specific choice of ansatz for the charm ff s at the starting scale is numerically irrelevant .",
    "changes in @xmath149 or @xmath33 are expected to be compensated through the fit by appropriate shifts in the input parameters of eqs .",
    "( [ peterson ] ) and ( [ standard ] ) , and do not represent an appreciable theoretical error source either .",
    "the variation in cross section due to the use of different proton pdf s is just of order 10% , as long as up - to - date sets are considered @xcite .",
    "the most substantial source of theoretical uncertainty is related to the photon pdf s . among the different sets used in ref .",
    "@xcite , grv  ho @xcite gave the smallest cross section at @xmath148 ; the variation was found to be about 40% .",
    "an increase of this size would render the theoretical predictions compatible with the zeus data point at @xmath150 , while it would be far to small to explain the data point at @xmath151 , which represents an unexpected rise in cross section .",
    "it remains to be seen if such a rise will also be observed by the h1 collaboration .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ zeus]c , we observe that , within the rather large experimental errors , all four theoretical predictions agree reasonably well with the data .",
    "the nlo - o result leads to the best description of the data .",
    "only the data point at @xmath152  gev is significantly above the theoretical expectation .    in the zeus paper @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath145 distributions were also presented for a minimum-@xmath8 cut of 3  gev .",
    "we performed similar comparisons with these data , too , but do not display them here , since our massless - charm and -bottom scheme is more appropriate for high values of @xmath8 . in the case of the @xmath7 distribution ,",
    "the general picture is very similar to fig .",
    "[ zeus]b , except that the data point at @xmath150 is then consistent with the theoretical expectation",
    ". similarly , in the case of the @xmath145 distribution , the data point at @xmath152  gev then agrees considerably better with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the opal and aleph collaborations presented measurements of the fractional energy spectrum of inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath11-boson decays based on their entire lep1 data samples @xcite .",
    "apart from the full cross section of @xmath0 production , they also determined the contribution arising from @xmath14 decays .",
    "this enabled us to update our lo and nlo fits of the @xmath0 ff s @xcite , which were based on previous opal and aleph analyses with considerably lower statistics @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", we also incorporated a conceptual modification of our theoretical framework , so as to eliminate two minor weaknesses of our previous approach @xcite : ( i ) at nlo , the differential cross section @xmath153 of @xmath10 turned negative for @xmath93 , so that the experimental data points in this region needed to be excluded from the fits ; this problem was also encountered in ref .",
    "( ii ) the lo and nlo results for the cross section of inclusive @xmath0 photoproduction in @xmath4 collisions substantially differed from each other , indicating that , in this particular scheme , higher orders beyond present control are likely to be significant . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the factorization of the final - state collinear singularities associated with the charm and bottom quarks was performed in a scheme which differs from the pure @xmath1 scheme with five massless quark flavors by the subtraction of certain finite functions from the parton - level cross sections .",
    "these functions were chosen in such a way that the resulting change of scheme is equivalent to the use of the perturbative ff s of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since these perturbative ff s describe the production of a massive quark @xmath154 rather than a heavy hadron @xmath155 , they need to be complemented by a nonperturbative component which accounts for the @xmath156 fragmentation process .",
    "in particular , this is requisite to make sure that the @xmath156 branching ratio and the average @xmath155 to @xmath154 longitudinal - momentum fraction take their measured values , which are indeed smaller than unity .",
    "since the charm quark is only moderately heavy , the effect of this nonperturbative component is rather dramatic , and its omission renders the theoretical description completely inadequate , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "clearly , the convolution of a perturbative ff with a nonperturbative ansatz can in turn be considered as a nonperturbative ff .",
    "this consideration brings us back to the pure @xmath1 scheme with five massless flavors , from which we started off . in this paper",
    ", we advocated the application of this scheme to charmed - meson production at high @xmath117 in @xmath2 annihilation and at large @xmath8 in @xmath4 scattering or similar types of collision .",
    "as a matter of principle , the question whether this approach is justified in the present case or not can only be answered by nature itself .",
    "we found that the pure @xmath1 scheme is clearly favoured by a wealth of experimental data on @xmath0 production @xcite .",
    "in fact , both drawbacks mentioned above are nicely avoided .",
    "furthermore , comparing figs .",
    "[ comp]a and b with fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that the general description of the @xmath2 data from doris @xcite , pep @xcite , and petra @xcite is improved , especially in the upper @xmath43 range .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the fit results for the input parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ peterson ] ) and ( [ standard ] ) , including the value of peterson s @xmath3 , are highly scheme dependent at nlo , and must not be navely compared disregarding the theoretical framework which they refer to .",
    "if we compare the values of @xmath80 and @xmath3 for the charm ff of set nlo  m previously obtained in the massive subtraction scheme @xcite with those of set nlo  o appropriate to the pure @xmath1 scheme , we find dramatic differences : @xmath157 and @xmath158 for set nlo  m versus @xmath159 and @xmath160 for set nlo  o. on the other hand , the respective lo results are almost identical ( @xmath161 and @xmath92 for set lo  m versus @xmath162 and @xmath91 for set lo  o ) , which indicates that the underlying data ( from refs .",
    "@xcite for set m and from ref .",
    "@xcite for set o ) are consistent with each other .    finally , we should caution the reader that the massless - quark approximation used here and the resulting ff s are only appropriate for processes of @xmath0 production which are characterized by an energy scale that is large against the charm - quark mass .",
    "in particular , this approach should not be expected to yield meaningful predictions for the photoproduction of small-@xmath8 @xmath0 mesons at hera .",
    "therefore , in order to substantiate the comparison of lep1 and hera data in the framework of the qcd - improved parton model endowed with nonperturbative ff s , it would be very desirable if the statistics of the hera data was increased in the large-@xmath8 bins .",
    "we are grateful to ties behnke and stefan sldner - rembold of opal , to paul colas of aleph , and to carsten coldewey of zeus for making available to us the respective data on @xmath0 production @xcite in numerical form .",
