    "schrdinger operators are used for modelling a particle confined in a quantum - mechanical system . depending on a potential which describes how the particle interacts with its environment",
    ", one can consider a wide range of physical situations . in this paper , we are particularly interested in potentials in dimension two supported by zero measure sets ; the supports could be for example graphs , curves or points .    the motivation to study such operators",
    "is based on the fact that they represent simple mathematical models of various nano - structures like quantum wires , photonic crystals , quantum dots , etc .",
    "one possible way to describe them is via quantum graphs ; it means that one considers ordinary differential equations on the graph edges , which are coupled through boundary conditions at the graph vertices so that the resulting operator is self - adjoint , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the operators we are going to deal with yield an alternative approach . the particle is not confined to the graph , but it moves in its vicinity if the potentials are attractive .",
    "hence the latter model is in a sense more realistic and it enables us to take the tunnelling effect into account .",
    "we aim to prove a limit relation between two classes of operators in @xmath0 in the presence of a magnetic field : those with attractive potentials supported by a curve or a graph on one side , and operators with point potentials on the other side .",
    "the crucial feature of the latter operators is the solvability of their spectral problem ; if the number of potentials is finite , then the essential spectrum stays unchanged and the discrete spectrum can be calculated numerically by solving an implicit equation .",
    "therefore , if we are able to find a sequence of point potential operators which approximates the given operator , we get an approximate method to calculate its discrete spectrum .    in fact , we will show that the approximation works for a larger family of potentials than just the ones supported by a curve .",
    "the regular potentials with kato property will be also included ; that is why we speak about a generalized kato class and potentials are replaced by more general measures . for a given measure @xmath1 from the generalized kato class ,",
    "it is possible to define the operator @xmath2 via association with a closed and semi - bounded quadratic form , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second way to define schrdinger operators with potentials supported by zero measure sets is by prescribing the operator domains , see @xcite for general singular perturbations , and @xcite or @xcite for point potentials ; there the domains are given by imposing a boundary condition on wavefunctions .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the free laplacian perturbed by a measure with kato property can be approximated by point potential operators ; in dimension one the convergence is in the norm resolvent sense , while in dimension three it is in the strong resolvent sense .",
    "according to @xcite , the situation in dimension two is similar to the three - dimensional case , moreover , the authors presented several physical systems where the approximation is useful in spectral calculations .",
    "the present task is to prove that the approximation also works in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that the main difficulty is not the proof itself ( it easily carries over from the non - magnetic case ) but rather the lack of information about magnetic systems .",
    "namely , we first need to clarify the definition of perturbations by a measure in section  [ sec : perturb ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : krein ] we derive an explicit formula for resolvents ; that must be done without using results from @xcite directly because their proof relies on the positivity preserving property of the free laplacian .",
    "section  [ sec : point ] deals with point potentials in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : approx ] we state the main approximation claim and we apply the approximation to a simple example in section  [ sec : appl ] , where the magnetic field is homogeneous and the potential is supported a circle .",

    "* theorem 15 ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is continuous on @xmath19 .",
    "hence it is possible to introduce the regularized green function @xmath20 = g_0^{\\mathrm{ren}}(a , a;z).\\ ] ] we will need this function when defining a perturbation by point potentials .    in the special case of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath21 one can write green function @xmath22 explicitly .",

    "@xmath226 since @xmath227 has a bounded and continuous version ( and it can be identified with @xmath228 ) , by hypothesis ( [ hypothesis 1 ] ) the last two term vanish in the limit and for the first term we only have to show that @xmath229 comparing equations ( [ def q ] ) and ( [ def sigma ] ) , one obtains following expression for @xmath230 , @xmath231 last two terms on the rhs vanish because of the hypothesis ( [ hypothesis 3 ] ) and also the first term goes to zero as @xmath198 since the numerator is a bounded function of @xmath189 .",

    "a potential with a zero measure support fulfils the condition above only if the codimenion of its support is equal to 1 .",
    "therefore one may approximate for example the potentials supported by compact surfaces .",
    "the main technical difficulty in dimension three comes from the fact that the green function of a magnetic schrdinger operator has a divergent term which depends on the given vector potential , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the vector potential also enters the definition of point potentials , hence the definition has to be modified as in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the divergent term is not logarithmic , hence the term @xmath242 in ( [ bc ] ) must be replaced by @xmath243 .",
    "one motivation for this paper was to obtain an alternative method to calculate discrete spectra .",

    "it is very natural to apply the approximation to a system whose spectral problem is exactly solvable so that we can compare the exact and approximate eigenvalues , obtained by numerical calculation . as",
    "an essential prerequisite for numerical calculations is to have an explicit formula for green function @xmath22 , we restrict the application only to the case of a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath21",
    ". then one can employ the expression ( [ homg ] ) .    to demonstrate how one can use the approximation to calculate discrete spectra ,",
    "let us present following example .",
    "suppose that the potential is attractive and constant and it is supported by a circle with radius @xmath244 .",
    "the potential can be thus described by two parameters @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "the easiest choice of point potential operators is the following : we place @xmath247 points equidistantly along the circle and put @xmath248 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath37 consists of landau levels @xmath249 and eigenvalues which have split off from the landau levels because of the presence of the potential .",
    "since we consider the potential being attractive , the eigenvalues are below the level they have arisen from ( and moving further down as the coupling constant @xmath33 grows . )    to find the eigenvalues explicitly , one has to decompose the operator into angular momentum subspaces and then to calculate the eigenvalues numerically by solving an implicit equation in each subspace , see @xcite .",
    "the resulting picture is that there is one sequence of eigenvalues in each gap between two adjacent landau level and below the lowest one , with the limit point at the upper landau level .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec1 ] depicts the comparison of the approximate and exact eigenvalues in two lowest gaps for two situations which differ only in the coupling constant @xmath33 .",
    "figure [ fig : spec1:b ] corresponds to a stronger attractive potential @xmath250 , therefore the eigenvalues are further from the landau levels than those in [ fig : spec1:a ] where @xmath251 .",
    "we observe that the approximate eigenvalues tend to the exact ones as the number of point potentials grows and that the convergence is slower when the coupling is stronger .",
    "one can roughly estimate that the convergence rate is of the type @xmath252 , where according to numerical calculations , @xmath253 appears to be around @xmath254 , while coefficient @xmath255 depends strongly on the coupling constant @xmath33 .    a close inspection of the eigenfunctions of the point",
    "potential operators would reveal that they have logarithmic peaks at the potential sites , since they are given as linear combinations of free green functions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "although by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.4 ) , these wavefunctions yield an approximation of wavefunctions of @xmath37 , the peaks are of course absent in exact eigenfunctions .",
    "we believe that this fact is partly responsible for the slow convergence of the approximate energies of the bound states to the exact ones .",
    "all the features we have described were observed in the non - magnetic case , see @xcite , with the exception that there one deals only with one gap @xmath256 and the number of eigenvalues in the gap is finite . in the absence of magnetic field the ground state of @xmath37 corresponds to angular momentum @xmath257 , the remaining bound states correspond to @xmath258 and they are double degenerate . in magnetic field there is no such degeneracy ; eigenvalues for angular momenta with opposite signs are different , because there is an extra angular momentum coming from the magnetic field . as figure [ fig : spec1:b ] suggests , also the approximate eigenvalues ( and in particular , their dependence on the number of point potentials ) behave differently : the eigenvalue crossing the landau level @xmath259 tends to the eigenvalue of @xmath37 for @xmath260 , while the eigenvalue for @xmath261 is the limit point of the second lowest approximate eigenvalue .",
