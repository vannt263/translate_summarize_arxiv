    "production of aligned arrangements of anisotropic objects is a challenging task . while for example carbon nanotubes and silicon nanowires can be conveniently grown into arrays , the alignment of these structures is often far from perfect .",
    "@xcite when oriented growth is not an option , anisotropic objects can be aligned by mechanical agitation such as shear @xcite , flow , @xcite or vibration @xcite , and sometimes a magnetic or electric field can act as the orientating agent .",
    "@xcite both in the macro scale and nano scale , most methods fail to give perfect alignment .",
    "the factors limiting the alignment are not fully understood .    in a composite material",
    ", the shape and width of the orientation distribution of its building blocks translates directly into other physical properties of the material .",
    "for example , the orientation distribution of carbon nanotubes within fibre ropes has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the ropes .",
    "@xcite theoretical studies show that the orientation distribution shape selected for simulation of a carbon nanotube film has a drastic effect on the electrical properties of the film .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , instead of carefully examining the shape of the orientation spread , most experimental studies on alignment of nano and macro scale objects have been focused on obtaining a single number , an average alignment or an order parameter . in some cases , the orientation distributions of particle assemblies have been described with gaussians @xcite , lorentzians @xcite , the combination of both @xcite , and even with squared lorentzians @xcite .",
    "typically , these functions did not fit the data perfectly but discrepancies between the data and the model were not discussed .",
    "recently , a new better - fitting function , the generalized normal distribution , was applied to carbon nanotube orientation distributions which had been measured with high statistical accuracy using synchrotron radiation .",
    "@xcite if this function could be applied also to other systems , it could be a game - changer for the study of aligned structures . in this contribution",
    ", we show that the generalized normal distribution fits to previously published data for many objects from nanometre to centimetre sizes , and we can now compare the shapes of the different orientation distributions to each other by using the same set of parameters .",
    "a survey of the literature shows that one of the most common ways to define the orientation of particle assemblies from x - ray scattering experiments or the like is by calculating the hermans orientation parameter @xcite @xmath0 where the mean - square cosine is calculated from the scattered intensity @xmath1 by integrating over the azimuthal angle @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : azimuth ] ) @xmath3 for perfect vertical orientation @xmath4 = 1 , for isotropic orientation @xmath4 = 0 , and for perfect horizontal orientation @xmath4 = -0.5 . in the following analysis",
    ", we have calculated the orientation parameter for all distributions as if they were perfectly vertically centred by shifting the @xmath5 accordingly in order to compare the orientation degree rather than direction of alignment .",
    "the orientation parameter can be calculated for any orientation distribution regardless of their shape .     along the circle , on the right .",
    "the intensity at each @xmath2 is related to the propability of finding a rod oriented in this angle within the sample.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the next step , we compare the values of hermans orientation parameter to parameters describing the shape of the orientation distribution for different experimentally observed particle assembly systems by refitting literature data . recently , it was identified that the shape of the orientation distribution of multiwalled carbon nanotube arrays ( mwcnts ) can be modelled accurately with a family of symmetric distributions that include all shapes between laplace and gaussian .",
    "@xcite this _ generalized normal distribution _ ( gnd ) , also called _ exponential power distribution _ in the literature @xcite has the form @xmath6 , \\label{gnd}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a scaling factor related to the width , @xmath8 is the shape parameter determining the sharpness , and @xmath9 is the mean of the distribution .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the gamma function .",
    "the gnd reduces to the normal distribution when @xmath8 = 2 and to laplace distribution when @xmath8 = 1 . due to its generality",
    ", this distribution has actually been invented several times in the course of history . in diffusion studies",
    "it is known as the _ stretched exponential function _ with @xmath11 , and in the field of relaxation dynamics in materials , it is also called the _ kohlrausch function _ [ or _ kohlrausch - williams - watts function _ ( kww ) ] after the physicist rudolf kohlrausch who applied it in the 19th century to describe electric charge decay",
    ". @xcite    in most cases in the literature , uncertainties for the data were not available so goodness - of - fit is not reported here , but the relative likelihoods for model selection were calculated from the residual sum of squares rss = @xmath12 .",
    "we use the akaike information criterion,@xcite aic = @xmath13 , to compare the relative likelihoods , @xmath14 , of the gaussian , lorentzian and generalized normal distribution for the model selection . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the number of free parameters , @xmath16 the number of data points , @xmath17 is one of the three models , and aic@xmath18 is the smallest aic value obtained for the models .",
    "[ fig : fitcomparison ] depicts one example of of a fit with gaussian and gnd .",
    "it should be noted that the measured orientation distribution is often merely a projection of the real one .",
    "methods which rely on counting the angles of individual particles in two - dimensional images can not capture the shape of the three - dimensional orientation distribution .",
    "but since this is the case also for many scattering methods , such as small - angle x - ray scattering , where we also see only the projection of the three - dimensional distribution , the experimental orientation distributions should be comparable to each other .",
    "the effect of projection on the shape of the orientation distribution is not dramatic : the projection of a normal distribution is a normal distribution , and the projection of a generalized normal distribution is a generalized normal distribution , only with different @xmath8 and @xmath7 because the projection shifts the shape of the distribution closer to a gaussian .",
    "@xcite    simulations of two - dimensional granular structures of cohesive , elongated particle assemblies can be found in the literature .",
    "@xcite in one of the the simulations , elongated particles with aspect ratio of 10 are dropped with random orientations onto a pile and the sticking coefficient of the particles is varied .",
    "the reported orientation distributions from this study are not exactly equivalent to the projected orientation distribution observed in many experiments , because the orientation of particles is defined solely with respect to horizontal plane , but the generalized normal distribution fits the simulated data : for non - sticking particles ( bond number bog = 0 , simulation1 ) , slightly sticking particles ( bond number bog = @xmath19 , simulation2 ) , and strongly sticking particles ( bond number bog = @xmath20 , simulation3 ) shape factors turn out to be @xmath8=1.48 , 1.36 , and 1.62 , respectively .",

    "all of the experimental data is located in the lower right corner of the graph and there seems to be no prominent difference between nano and macro scale particles . the dashed line showing a fit to a few data points in which alignment has been obtained by shearing shows a sort of a limit to the orientation distribution shape .",
    "it is possible to achieve near to perfect alignment using these commonly used methods for alignment but then , according to this graph , we should expect the orientation distribution to be more laplace like than gaussian .    in the case of al@xmath24o@xmath25 platelets",

    "effect of a moderate amount of cohesion is seen both in simulation @xcite and experiment as a decrease in @xmath8 and increase in @xmath7 .",
    "the simulation with most sticky particles results in a broad orientation distribution with increased @xmath8 .",
    "the carbon nanotube forests could be described effectively as very sticky granular systems .",
    "the most prominent result from cohesion is the decrease in the overal orientation degree of the particles .    despite the success in fitting most of the data presented in table  [ tab : shape ] , there is also one data set which could not be fitted with the gnd . in case of polymer crystallites of poly(@xmath29-caprolactone",
    ") oriented under strain , @xcite the orientation of crystallites did not follow the generalized normal distribution .",
    "this is an example of a system which is composed of particles that are interconnected .",
    "this situation is very different from all the other cases presented here .",

    "now that we have identified the generalized normal distribution to be a feasible model for a multitude of particulate systems , we need to consider its physical meaning .",
    "there exist several theoretical models for orientation distributions of particles in different environments , and it is not clear if some of them could actually have the same shape as the generalized normal distribution .",
    "fitting a non - cyclic function to the orientation distribution as a function of azimuthal angle @xmath2 is not fully correct , because it can not describe all the situations between isotropically oriented and fully oriented systems .",
    "a mathematically correct model would need to have cyclic properties .",
    "next , we inspect cyclic functions found in the literature to see if they could actually reproduce the shape of the generalized normal distribution",
    ". theoretical framework for the orientation distribution shape exists for example in the case of spheroidal particles in dilute suspension under shear .",
    "the function describing the orientation of spheroids of aspect ratio @xmath31 is given @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath2 is the misorientation of the symmetry axis of the particle compared to the flow direction .",
    "this shape should be valid also for other centrosymmetric particles , such as cylinders and discs , but fitting this function with the generalized normal distribution did not produce satisfying results .    the maier - saupe distribution , which can be applied to describe the orientation distributions in liquid crystals and to study the chain orientation in cholesterol - lipid systems , @xcite is a much more promising candidate for the physical background of the generalized normal distribution .",
    "a thorough examination of the maier - saupe distribution for scattering data is given by mills et al .",
    "@xcite , and they define it @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a modified bessel function of the first kind and @xmath35 is a parameter related to the width of the distribution . for simplicity , we have omitted the normalization factor in equation  ( [ maiersaupe ] ) but it can be found in the original publication . while @xmath36 can be fitted to great accuracy ( but not perfectly ) with the generalized normal distribution , the shape factor , @xmath8 , remains above 1.73 for all parameter values of the maier - saupe distribution and hence the maier - saupe model can not be the correct model to use in the case of most of the systems presented here .",

    "the cylinders are more oriented along the symmetry axis .",
    "again , @xmath43 does not have the shape of the generalized normal distribution .",

    "the von mises - fisher distribution is a directional analogue of the gaussian distribution and hence it can not reproduce the shapes of the generalized normal distribution , apart from @xmath8 = 2",
    ".    none of the cyclic functions , @xmath51 , presented above are able to capture the range of distribution shapes which we found in real systems . in conclusion , despite the shortcomings due to non - cyclicity , the generalized normal distribution is at the moment the most suited function for the study of moderately aligned systems , even if it can not be used to describe systems close to isotropic alignment .",
    "here we have shown that alignment of freely moving anisotropic objects both in nano and macro scale can be described by one function , the generalized normal distribution .",
    "spread of the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : hermans ] allows us to draw some general conclusions about the alignment of anisotropic objects .",
    "we observe that the projection of orientation distribution of anisotropic particles is close to the laplace distribution ( @xmath52 ) when very good alignment is achieved .",
    "exponential decay occurs commonly in the field physics , and the laplacian orientation distribution may be a manifestation of an underlying relaxation processes , which follow an exponential decay .",
    "moderate or poor alignment will lead to a more gaussian distribution ( @xmath53 ) but slightly cohesive particles may behave differently .",
    "these findings should be taken into account in future studies of materials consisting of aligned anisotropic particles .",
