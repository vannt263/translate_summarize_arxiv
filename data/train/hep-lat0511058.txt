    "large-@xmath10 expansions are useful to approach nonperturbative dynamics of field theories and are often used to study their phase transitions at nonzero temperature @xmath11 . here",
    "we focus on the dependence of the critical region of strongly coupled lattice qcd on the number of colors , @xmath0 , and flavors , @xmath12 .",
    "this region of temperatures is where mean field ( mf ) theory fails , and fluctuations , that can not be ignored , drive the system to a nontrivial fixed point .",
    "what motivates us are the studies of the suppression of this region in the large-@xmath10 gross - neveu and yukawa models @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite , suggest that the same phenomenon occurs in qcd at large-@xmath0 , and discuss its physical implications . in apparent contrast to that , in the letter @xcite , which presents numerical simulations of strongly - coupled lattice qcd with staggered fermions and large @xmath13 , the authors claim to find that mf fails at large-@xmath0 , and as evidence show that the critical region does not shrink with @xmath0 in their simulations .    to understand this apparent contradiction and when to expect a suppression of the critical region in general , we study an effective hamiltonian which is derived in second order of the strong - coupling expansion from the lattice qcd hamiltonian , and that describes the low energy effective excitations of mesons .",
    "we work in @xmath14 spatial dimensions and with @xmath0 colors and @xmath12 flavors of naive fermions .",
    "this gives us flexibility to explore a large parameter space , and enables us to show that which large-@xmath10 makes a system trivial depends on which @xmath10 is large .",
    "following studies of similar hamiltonians in the condensed matter literature @xcite , we explore the critical behavior of this effective hamiltonian in three different large-@xmath10 limits : ( i ) the large-@xmath0 limit , where the ",
    "t hooft coupling @xmath1 is kept fixed .",
    "( ii ) the combined limit of large-@xmath0 _ and _ large-@xmath12 , where a l veneziano , we fix both @xmath15 and @xmath1 , and ( iii ) the limit of large @xmath12 but with fixed @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "we summarize the results of these studies in the next paragraphs .    in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    "we show that the largeness of @xmath0 serves to suppress quantum fluctuations , and leads to a classical hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian is a generalized heisenberg antiferromagnet , whose ordered ground state corresponds to the chiral broken phase .",
    "a mf ansatz in terms of the ` spins ' is exact only at @xmath16 , and is not adequate to study the critical behavior near @xmath17 . in particular ,",
    "the critical exponents are determined by @xmath12 and @xmath14 , and are not expected to belong to the gaussian fixed point .",
    "one can , _ as a first step _ , analyze the transition in mf , but by definition , this analysis is bound to fail within the critical region , which we show to have a nonzero width at @xmath2 . unfortunately , since at @xmath2 the temperature @xmath17 turns out to be infinite , then it is difficult to learn about the behavior of transitions in planar qcd from the  t hooft limit of our effective hamiltonian , and we therefore use these results only to understand @xcite , but discuss how they should be improved .    in the combined limit of large @xmath0 and @xmath12 , the situation is different , and one can solve for a mf ansatz that is exact at @xmath18 for all @xmath11 ( @xmath17 is finite is this limit ) .",
    "reviewing known results , we show that this solution yields a correlation length that diverges with a mf exponent only for @xmath19 , and otherwise for @xmath20 . extending this",
    ", we also show that the width of the critical region depends on @xmath12 , and @xmath0 only through their ratio @xmath15 , and is nonzero .    in the limit of large-@xmath12 and fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "a mf ground state is again exact for all @xmath11 , but leaves chiral symmetry intact even at @xmath16 . in @xmath21 , a global minimum of the system",
    "is the `` spin - peierls '' state , which breaks lattice translations and rotations @xcite .",
    "a corresponding analysis in @xmath22 includes an extensive search in the space of all possible ansatze for the global ground state , and is out of the scope of this work .",
    "since this limit has a restricted relevance for qcd ( for example , asymptotic freedom is lost here ) but is crucial for our purpose ( see below ) , we proceed to study the restoration of these lattice symmetries at finite @xmath11 for the @xmath21 system , and for simplicity also fix @xmath5 .",
    "we believe that a generalization to @xmath22 , and @xmath23 will change the results only in detail but not in principle , and find no point to do so .",
    "( for example , see the @xmath8 generalization at @xmath16 , and @xmath21 in @xcite )    the lattice symmetries are restored in a second order transition at the finite @xmath17 , whose critical behavior is closely related to the behavior seen in @xcite for the systems studied there .",
    "we show that taking @xmath3 before @xmath24 , makes mf exponents exact .",
    "switching the order of the limits , we find that the landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) action for the transition describes scalar fields coupled through @xmath25 interactions . as emphasized in @xcite , this suggests a crossover behavior , which we find to occur when @xmath26 .    combining the results of @xcite , and of our study here , we emphasize that the critical region in large-@xmath10 phase transitions is suppressed only when the lgw effective action for the transition has an overall factor of @xmath27 .",
    "this suppresses thermal fluctuations in the order parameter , and can make mf scaling exact .",
    "our message here is that this does not happen in all large-@xmath10 treatments , and in particular does not happen for the chiral phase transitions of the effective hamiltonian that we study here .",
    "we begin this report in section  [ sec : heff ] where we introduce the effective hamiltonian of lattice qcd in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "we then move to discuss large @xmath0 and fixed @xmath12 in section  [ sec : thooft ] , large @xmath0 and large @xmath12 in section  [ sec : veneziano ] , and the large @xmath12 with fixed @xmath0 in section  [ sec : largenf ] .",

    "strong coupling expansions were used in lattice gauge theory since its early days . in particular , they were performed for the gauge group @xmath28 as well as for @xmath29 .",
    "for example , in the pure @xmath28 gauge theory , expansions were made for the string tension and the for free energy as well as for the beta function @xcite . in the case of qcd with @xmath0 colors , and various types of fermions ,",
    "calculations were made for the effective low energy action of hadrons and for mesons masses @xcite .",
    "the result of these treatments ( which is most relevant to the discussions is sections  [ sec : thooft]-[sec : veneziano ] ) is that for large values of @xmath0 , the natural expansion parameter in the strong coupling series is the inverse ",

    "the result of this procedure may be different from taking the opposite order of the limits ( first @xmath38 and only then @xmath39 ) . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", one may find that these limits commute only as long as @xmath40 . indeed for the two - dimensional pure gauge theory with the wilson action one finds @xmath41 @xcite . for higher dimensions the situation is more involved but",
    "there still is a finite range of @xmath1 in which the theory is in a strong coupling phase ( for example see early analytical results in @xcite and recent numerical results in @xcite ) . since fermions are quenched in the ",
    "t hooft limit , we take these results to apply for qcd ( with a fixed nonzero mass ) as well , but we are not aware of any analogous results in the veneziano limit of fixed @xmath42 .    in this paper",
    "we follow the former approach ( which is also the approach of euclidean treatments such as @xcite ) : we fix @xmath0 and use an expansion in @xmath43 .",

    "following @xcite we take @xmath64 in sections  [ sec : thooft ] , and [ sec : largenf ] , and @xmath65 in section  [ sec : veneziano ] .",
    "the reason is that these cases are the simplest to analyze .",
    "the hamiltonian is a generalized heisenberg quantum antiferromagnet , and its nel ordered state spontaneously breaks the global @xmath49 symmetry . adding explicit symmetry breaking terms",
    "can reduce @xmath49 to its subgroup @xmath66 ( e.g. see @xcite ) , and as a result , the nel phase corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .. ]    note that is a result of rayleigh - schrodinger degenerate perturbation theory applied to split the degeneracy of the zero gauge - flux sector of the strong - coupling lattice qcd spectrum .",
    "excitations of strings with a nonzero gauge flux cost an energy that scales like @xmath67 and are neglected here .",
    "as a result the chiral phase transition of will not involve a condensation of polyakov lines of the type discussed in @xcite . adding",
    "the effects of these gauge strings will make the description of the transition more realistic , and in particular will relate chiral symmetry restoration to deconfinement .",
    "this restriction to the zero flux sector means that the hamiltonian describes chiral dynamics of qcd only at temperatures @xmath68 . as a result one should be careful when ` extrapolating ' the behavior of ( or its euclidean counterpart ) to qcd at temperatures close to the transition",
    "this is a significant difficulty that exists in the strong coupling approach to finite temperature lattice qcd , which we can not resolve here , and that the reader should be aware of .",
    "nonetheless , since the model in shows different critical behaviors in different large-@xmath10 limits , it is a sufficient and useful choice for our study , and can tell what conditions are needed for a large-@xmath10 transition to have mf critical exponents .",
    "also , the hamiltonian is sufficient to understand the work of @xcite , which also neglects excitations of the gauge - flux .",

    "finally note that the global @xmath49 transformations are realized here as @xmath78 , or @xmath79 .    for large values of @xmath0 , and @xmath80 ,",
    "the overall factor of @xmath81 suppresses fluctuations , and the mf anstaz @xmath82 which breaks @xmath49 to @xmath83 , is exact .",
    "an expansion around the mf ansatz , results in a chiral theory of mesons with @xmath84 interactions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath85 is of @xmath84 then fluctuations in the second , ` interaction ' term , are not suppressed , and many sigma field configurations contribute to the path integral .",
    "nonetheless , the largeness of @xmath0 suppresses quantum fluctuations for any @xmath85 , by making @xmath86 in the first , ` kinetic ' term .",
    "this can also be seen by rescaling the operators @xmath87 in , to find that the commutation relations vanish at @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , this is in analogy with the large-@xmath88 limit that makes quantum antiferromagnets into classical systems . in our case",
    "we get the classical hamiltonian @xmath89 whose critical temperature @xmath90 .",
    "this means that @xmath85 scales like @xmath91 and therefore that at @xmath92 , @xmath85 is of @xmath84 . as a result",
    "the mf ansatz is not predictive at these temperatures , and treatments such as @xcite , are expected to fails there .",

    "will mf be a good description , like it is for ordinary spin systems .",
    "mf theory does not fail here since it is not supposed to work at all , and we believe that this is what @xcite saw numerically .",
    "one might think that mf scaling fails because the ansatz used above is temperature independent , and as emphasized above , is strictly exact only for low @xmath11 . in the next section",
    "we show that this expectation is too naive .",
    "finally we note that the estimate of @xmath97 has been obtained in other strong - coupling expansions as well ( for example see @xcite ) . at first sight",
    "this is puzzling since there should be only one scale in this theory which is @xmath98 .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the one discussed in @xcite , where the author shows that the thermal corrections to @xmath99 in the framework of continuum chiral perturbation theory are of @xmath100 .",
    "naively , this leads to expect @xmath101 .",
    "this ` paradox ' is resolved in @xcite by noting that the expansion in @xmath11 must have a finite radius of convergence of the order of the hagedorn temperature .",
    "the latter is an external notion to the chiral lagrangian , and can be thought of as proliferation of string of nonzero gauge - flux .",
    "indeed , the action of our nonlinear sigma model is the chiral lagrangian in our context , and is reached only when one neglects flux excitations ( see discussion in section  [ sec : heff ] ) . as a consequence , it seems that the reason that in strong - coupling @xmath97 , and not a function of just @xmath1 , is the discard of flux condensation .",
    "in fact the authors in @xcite study the interplay of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration in strong coupling , and find that an assuming flux condensation gives a chiral symmetry restoration temperature which is @xmath102 at large-@xmath0 .",
    "we thus expect that the inclusion flux condensation will lead to a @xmath103 in the hamiltonian approach as well , and that it will be the critical behavior of the resulting system which may be indicative to what happens in the  t hooft limit in the continuum .",
    "the aim of this section is to investigate a case where the mf ansatz is @xmath11-dependent and exact at @xmath104 .",
    "this can be achieved by taking both @xmath12 , and @xmath0 to be large , while keeping their ratio fixed ( @xmath1 is still kept fixed here ) .",
    "this limit was first studied by @xcite , for @xmath65 with the schwinger bosons method , and leads to a spontaneous breakdown of @xmath105 .",
    "this tells us that chiral symmetry may be realized differently than in qcd , and that to break @xmath49 in the same pattern as in section  [ sec : thooft ] , one needs to generalize the procedures in @xcite to @xmath64 .",
    "this was done in @xcite , which found that the _ simplest _ ansatz for general @xmath59 gives the same mf equations as for @xmath65 .",
    "this encourages us to choose @xmath65 as well , and to postpone a discussion of a more sophisticated ansatz to possible future research .",

    "the fact that the pure gauge theory has a first order deconfinement transition at large-@xmath0 ( e.g. see @xcite ) means that to study such a phenomenon in pure gauge , one has to approach a hidden hagedorn transition , where the mass of the loop vanishes .",

    "<S> we study the critical behavior at nonzero temperature phase transitions of an effective hamiltonian derived from lattice qcd in the strong - coupling expansion . </S>",
    "<S> following studies of related quantum spin systems that have a similar hamiltonian , we show that for large @xmath0 and fixed @xmath1 , mean field scaling is not expected , and that the critical region has a finite width at @xmath2 . a different behavior rises for @xmath3 and fixed @xmath0 and @xmath4 , which we study in two spatial dimensions and for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the width of the critical region is suppressed by @xmath6 with @xmath7 , and argue that a generalization to @xmath8 and to three dimensions will change this only in detail ( e.g. the value of @xmath9 ) , but not in principle . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by stating under what conditions this suppression is expected , and remark on possible realizations of this phenomenon in lattice gauge theories in the continuum . </S>"
