    "after two decades of random laser research @xcite these systems are still highly fascinating . the involved rich physics and also possible applications @xcite in systems that , at first glance appear to be just dust powder have started to reveal more and more fascinating details . absolutely essential for the fundamental behavior of a random laser is the spatial extension of random lasing modes .",
    "if the lasing spots are strongly confined , the random laser actually is operated as a collection of single - mode lasers where the modes do not overlap in space @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the random laser can exhibit another type of mode which covers the whole ensemble showing significantly different emission characteristics and a higher laser threshold .",
    "additionally all these properties are derived without confining external resonator and the modes seem to be only due to transport through disordered granular media and amplification .",
    "the experimental finding that spatially confined and extended laser modes can actually co - exist in the same region of strongly scattering nano - crystalline powders @xcite has been completely counterintuitive",
    ". nevertheless an ab initio description for coherent emitting modes in diffusive , weakly or strongly localizing systems could not yet be given for this phenomenon .",
    "in this paper we derive by means of quantum field diagrammatical photon transport incorporating several loss channels spatially confined and extended random laser modes which may co - exist .",
    "it is proven that the experimentally observed mode types in different gain regimes can be explained in a single framework of transport renormalized by dissipation .",
    "dissipation processes are not only frequency selective with respect to the absorption and transmission properties of the substrate , they can be further influenced by the dispersity of the powder , and the nonlinear enhancement . we show that the emission statistics , the coherence and the threshold of random laser modes are severely changing due to symmetry breaking of photonic transport by dissipation .",
    "however we find that also modes with strong losses arrive at a laser threshold .",
    "this result can be checked by measuring the extent and the degree of coherence of random laser modes relying on non - symmetric boundaries .",
    "light transport in random media is a very fascinating subject . in non - linear granular systems of low packing radiation transport",
    "obeys the well known diffusion equation , whereas in densely packed random media coherent transport sets in which is formost seen in a deviation from the exponential decay of diffusive light intensity , the long - time tail .",
    "fancy effects like coherent backscattering ( cbs ) , a factor of two of light intensity in the exact backscattering direction , can be observed .",
    "diagrammatic transport of light intensity which treats light propagation as well defined paths of photons ( see sketch fig.[exp ] ) can describe these observations .",
    "a photon ( green line ) is scattered by active particles , possible spheres .",
    "this means that it is absorbed by a particle and excites the electronic structure of the material as well as the internal geometrical resonance , rayleigh - scattering or mie - scattering . during the ( re-)emission process frequency conversion and decoherence processes of the electronic sub - structure",
    "can lead to frequency changes .",
    "the exact time reversal procedure is denoted red .",
    "both photons , the forward propagator and the time reversal procedure can interfere . a perfect interference or correlation the of propagator and time - reversal procedure is represented in diagrammatics by the most crossed diagram , the cooperon @xcite .",
    "cooperons again may suffer destructive influences at the samples boundaries .",
    "if photons leak out or if their frequency is absorbed , the symmetry is broken .",
    "absorption processes can efficiently be used to tune light transport in random systems as well as waveguides @xcite .",
    "lasing in granular media is often described in terms of random cavities @xcite modes or quasi-(leaky ) modes @xcite .",
    "these modes are by definition coherent and therefore obey poissonian statistics .",
    "they have been estimated to form so called random cavities , in other words artificial but random cavities which are determined by the local scatterer arrangement .",
    "this scenario is of course possible , but fundamentally different from what we describe in this letter .",
    "we investigate with the diagrammatic ansatz random lasing in nanocrystalline zno samples embedded in small depressions etched in a si - waver .",
    "a similar experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that at first laser threshold a spatially confined mode starts to lase symmetrically in space . with increasing pump strength ,",
    "a rising number of modes of this type may be found strongly localized at several spatial positions .",
    "increasing the excitation power further a second laser threshold for a different lasing frequency of another type of mode is found .",
    "the diameter of this mode is large compared to the others , it may cover the whole sample .",
    "the physics of both modes is fundamentally different and we will see that the extended mode arises in principle only for a symmetry breaking due to dissipation .",
    "we use a diagrammatic field theory ansatz for light in a diffusive system including interferences , vollhardt - wlfle theory of photons @xcite which has proven to be rigorous for signatures of anderson localization in non - linear random media @xcite .",
    "vollhardt - wlfle ansatz precisely means that the modes we derive here are in their information value not restricted to the coherence of the wave but they additionally describe the coherence of transported light intensity and its decay . as already outlined the difference in the diameters",
    "can not be explained just by the increase of the pump power or the dispersity of the powder alone . only investigating the possibility of frequency dependent dissipation varying in space , the absorption of photons by the crystal substrate at the boundary , yields the difference of the diameters .",
    "loss initially suppresses a large number of modes which only arrive at their lasing threshold eventually for significantly higher pump strengths when the intrinsic nonlinear gain yields a balanced process . strictly speaking , several spatially and spectrally distinctive loss channels within the zno sample and the si - crystal substrate @xcite lead to the co - existence of both types of modes ; the extended mode overall loses more intensity .",
    "it seems at first sight that the principle itself is reprising at another intensity scale which is induced by further degrees of freedom , but the study of the correlation length with respect to the position in the granular matter will clearly bring forward that symmetry breaking due to loss causes fundamental differences .",
    "one could even imagine tuning the powder s parameters in such a way that a stepwise access to different loss mechanisms could be possible and the random laser therefore could be controlled by the ensemble size , the surface , the type of substrate etc .. + theoretically the non - linearity is actually being established by a doubly nested self - consistent calculation . in the following , a description for correlation and coherence of light in terms of wave and particle is explained . the photon density response , the four - point correlator is derived from bethe - salpeter equation ( bs ) for photons ,     +    @xmath0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which reads in position space    @xmath1    the numbering marks independent positions within space , the dashes denote the selfconsistency of the diagram .",

    "numerical calculations of self - consistent photonic transport theory and random lasing lead to a variety of directly measurable quantities . above all we mention that in disordered amplifying and constrained samples like the si - confined zno powder here , the gain is clearly influenced by the boundary and consequently dependent to the position of measurement .",

    "a comparison of emitted intensity in spatial resolution fig.[dual](a ) clearly shows that the extended laser mode obeys different laws than the confined mode does .",
    "the difference is obvious when comparing both profiles , the restricted y - dimension ( blue dashed graph ) and the wide x - dimension ( solid lines ) .",
    "the aspect ratio is clearly of fundamental importance even though both directions are by far longer than the scattering mean free path which is in both cases about @xmath64 ( details see caption of fig.[dual ] ) .",
    "@xmath26 is very short due to high self - consistent non - linearities .",
    "these non - linearities lead to a significantly different refractive index for pumped material compared to a result derived by cbs far below the threshold .",
    "the behavior can be explained in our model of coherent intensity propagation that differs from the so - called quasi - mode model .",
    "in contrast to quasi - modes , that are deduced from a diagrammatic _ single particle picture _ of the electromagnetic wave , our results go much further .",
    "the correlation length @xmath27 can be interpreted as a measure of the mode in the _ correlated two particle picture _ , the coherence of the wave and simultaneously the coherent transport of intensity .",
    "it can be explained as follows : especially the interference contributions ( cooperons ) suffer from dissipation , meaning the symmetry break in - plane especially reduces interference effects .",
    "consequently the degree of coherence of transported intensity in the situation fig.[dual](b ) below the threshold is much higher - apart from all spatial effects - than in situation fig.[dual](c ) .",
    "this transport inherent coherence leads to a stronger accumulation of intensity but even more to higher non - linear gain .",
    "the concrete meaning is that the unlimited development of the cooperon drives the system very fast to the lasing transition , which as such guarantees energy conservation in stationary state .",
    "lethokov s bomb argument in other words is avoided because the system prefers to lase .",
    "+ in case of extended modes the situation changes .",
    "cooperons are inhibited in their development due to the loss to the boundaries . finally it can be deduced that extended modes are preferentially built up by incoherent contributions and the accumulated intensity is locally renormalized by the loss through the boundary . in both cases",
    "cooperon contributions remain to be the coherent stimulation process of emission . + this positional distribution of the modes coherent intensities are displayed in the color coding of fig.[dual](b ) and ( c ) . corresponding laser thresholds to both mode types can be compared in fig.[thresh ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the confined mode ( green ) reaches the threshold for by far lower pumping intensity @xmath65 than the extended mode ( blue ) does .",
    "+ it is noted that this approach is in principle usable to construct spatially overlapping as well as spectrally coupled laser switches @xcite , the mode coupling can be by far more sophisticatedly designed than in this paper .",
    "the solution of a complicated statistical behavior like that of random lasing in granular disordered matter visualizes the power of vollhardt - wlfle transport theory of photons which we coupled to laser rate equations self - consistently .",
    "the correlation length for the intensity at the laser transition derived by diagrammatic transport theory describes the modes shapes and diameters and it includes the conditions of spatially uniform as well as time - reversal symmetry breaking losses . engineering highly frequency selective substrates is an efficient tuning mechanism for spectrally very close modes which arise at different thresholds and arrive at completely different shapes and diameters due to the breaking of the spatial symmetry .",
    "confined modes exist due to unbroken spatial symmetry , extended modes arise due to spatially non - uniform position - dependent losses and non - linearities .",
    "the conception of the mode we derive in this work is fundamentally different from the quasi - mode picture , which is a single - particle picture results .",
    "our theory defines the lasing modes as correlations between scattered photons .",
    "the here presented results for lasing mode diameters , are inseparable from the two - particle picture and they are a measure of coherent transported intensity in granular amplifying media at the laser threshold . a breaking of positional symmetry leads to the formation of extended modes and in the same process to their pinning .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the aspect ratio of the sample is relevant for the modes shapes , even though the samples are by far larger in every extent than the scattering mean free path",
    ". additionally a symmetry break due to loss leads to significantly differing lasing threshold behavior , varying gain and gain - saturation dynamics .",
