    "the nature of the microscopic description of metallic ferromagnetism , as found in transition metals such as iron , nickel and cobalt , is a long - standing problem in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the hubbard model was formulated in the 1960 s @xcite in order to describe ferromagnetism in such materials .",
    "however , a ferromagnetic ground state in the single  band hubbard model on nonfrustrated bipartite lattices has not been found at physical parameter values , and can be excluded in a large portion of the ground  state phase diagram . while mean  field theory yields a large region of stable ferromagnetism",
    ", fluctuations tend to destabilize the ferromagnetic phase , and numerical and variational calculations have narrowed the possible extent of a ferromagnetic state to a small region around the nagoaka point .",
    "therefore , it has become clear that additional features must be added to provide a description of metallic ferromagnetism.@xcite    recently , a number of such possible extensions to the hubbard model have been investigated . in particular , there are three classes of additions which can enhance ferromagnetism : _ ( i ) _ a change in the noninteracting density of states through the addition of frustrating hopping terms or the treatment of a geometrically frustrated lattice _",

    "@xcite have emphasized that peaks or singularities in the occupied portion of the noninteracting density of states minimizes the kinetic energy loss due to polarization of the electrons .",
    "this picture is supported by numerical calculations in one @xcite and two dimensions,@xcite and within the dynamical mean - field theory with a number of different forms of the noninteracting density of states .",
    "@xcite in addition , mielke @xcite has shown rigorously that a hubbard model with a less than half ",
    "filled flat band has a fully polarized ground state .",
    "this theorem has been extended to the case of nearly flat bands .",

    "neighbor hopping and an arbitrary , but real and particle  symmetric interaction , a theorem by lieb and mattis @xcite rules out a magnetized ground state . because the lieb  mattis theorem no longer applies when electrons can pass around each other ,",
    "the minimal addition to the one  dimensional hubbard model necessary to obtain ferromagnetism is a next  nearest  neighbor hopping . the resulting hubbard model on",
    "a `` zigzag '' ladder has a ferromagnetic ground state in a substantial parameter regime .",

    "the simplest of these models are the one  dimensional periodic anderson model ( pam ) and the kondo lattice model ( klm ) .",

    "the dmrg is a variational numerical method closely related to exact diagonalization , but which can be used to treat much larger systems.@xcite being able to treat sufficiently large systems is important since the models we study here have two fermionic sites , i.e.  sixteen degrees of freedom per unit cell , which would severely limit the maximum size available for exact diagonalization .",

    "the maximum sum of discarded density matrix eigenvalues is approximately @xmath48 .    in order to search for ferromagnetic phases ,",
    "it is essential to be able to determine the total spin of the ground state . since our version of the dmrg algorithm",

    "first , we can calculate the expectation value @xmath49 directly , where @xmath50 is the variational dmrg ground state calculated in a particular @xmath51 sector , and @xmath52 is the explicit operator for the square of the total spin .",

    "in the first part of this work , we present a comparison between the @xmath1@xmath0 system and the pam . the qualitative picture developed for the ferromagnetic phase of the pam @xcite should also apply to the @xmath1@xmath0 model . in order to make the correspondence to the pam , we choose a regime in which the @xmath1-orbital lies below the bottom of the @xmath0-band . at exactly quarter",

    "the hole can delocalize and thus lower its energy if the spins of the @xmath1holes are oriented in the same direction , i.e.  are ferromagnetically ordered .",
    "the binding energy for these singlets can be calculated within perturbation theory in a manner similar to that applied to the two - dimensional case by zhang and rice , @xcite yielding    @xmath59    2 for @xmath60 and @xmath56 , @xmath61 .    in general ,",
    "when there are @xmath62 holes in the @xmath0-band , this effect will favor a ferromagnetic ground state with total spin @xmath63 .",
    "we will denote this value of @xmath64 for the ground state as _ complete _ ferromagnetism , while a value of @xmath64 smaller but still greater than the minimum , will be labeled _",
    "incomplete_. note that a complete state has a lower magnetization than a saturated one .",
    "it represents a state where all the _ uncompensated _ d - spins are aligned .",
    "thus , one would expect a competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism near quarter filling similar to that found in the pam.@xcite for the pam there is an exact result that proves the ground state is ferromagnetic with complete magnetization for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67.@xcite there is no such result , however , for the @xmath1@xmath0 model .",
    "furthermore , while the antiferromagnetic exchange is a sixth  order process in the anderson lattice model , it is fourth order ( and therefore stronger ) in the @xmath1@xmath0 system . therefore , it is not clear that the ferromagnetism will still be present in the @xmath1@xmath0 system .",
    "yanagisawa @xcite studied a @xmath68 cuo cluster with exact diagonalization and found a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "however , it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the behavior in the thermodynamic limit from such a small cluster .    in our dmrg calculations ,",
    "we consider chains with @xmath69 and open boundary conditions and set @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath56 .",

    "[ fig02](b ) , the region of complete ferromagnetism is pushed towards higher values of @xmath18 and higher densities and there is a wide region of incomplete states at low densities .",

    "@xmath82 is the @xmath1spin raising operator on site @xmath79 . for @xmath83 ( quarter filling ) ,",
    "the correlations are clearly antiferromagnetic with the amplitude decaying slowly with distance , while for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the correlations are ferromagnetic .",
    "this illustrates that the system goes from an antiferromagnetic state at quarter filling to a ferromagnetic state as soon as additional holes are added for these parameter values .",
    "the competition between the tendency to ferromagnetism and the antiferromagnetic exchange gives rise to the region of _ incomplete _ ferromagnetism at low doping .",
    "in this region , we find that the system _ phase separates _ into domains of complete ferromagnetism in which the @xmath0holes are localized and antiferromagnetic domains in which the @xmath0band is empty . indeed , the first symptom of this phase separated state can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , in which there is a jump in the correlation function for @xmath86 for the case of 18 holes .",

    "there are two distinct domains in the lattice : one in which the @xmath1holes are completely polarized and another one in which they tend to order antiferromagnetically .",

    "[ fig08 ] for an @xmath69 chain and both possible signs of @xmath5 .",
    "the cases with complete polarization , @xmath63 , are circled . for @xmath161",
    "the phase diagram has one ferromagnetic region consisting almost exclusively of complete polarization for @xmath162 and from @xmath163 to @xmath164 .",
    "the arguments of the first part of our work should also apply to this region , i.e.  the ferromagnetic ordering of the @xmath2spins is caused by the condensation of zhang  rice singlets .",
    "as can be seen from the lack of regions of incomplete polarization , we find no phase separation at these parameter values .",
    "it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ eqnnpc1 ] ) can not properly predict the boundary of the ferromagnetic phase since it is invalid at the relatively large @xmath165 values at which we find the phase . from eq .",
    "( [ eqnpslength ] ) , the charactistic size of the localization of the singlets is given by @xmath166 for these parameter values .",
    "our energetic arguments therefore predict no phase separation at the densities at which we do find a ferromagnetic phase .    when @xmath167 the phase diagram is quite different .",
    "there is one point at quarter filling and @xmath168 for which the ground state is fully polarized ( @xmath169 for @xmath69 ) , surrounded by a region of smaller polarization . additionally , there is a region with polarization greater than complete , but less than fully polarized for a narrow range of @xmath5 but a wide range of hole occupation , @xmath165 .",
    "more precisely , the extent of this region is @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we first discuss the fully polarized phase at quarter filling and @xmath172 .",
    "one can gain insight into the origin of this ferromagnetic phase by examining the noninteracting band structure .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eqncuoham ] ) , with @xmath173 and periodic boundary conditions leads to the hybridized bands    @xmath174    2 these bands , plotted for three @xmath5 values near the fully polarized point , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figbands ] .",
    "as can be seen , the lower band does not overlap with the upper band and has a dispersion that is quite flat ; it becomes completely flat at @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , all the holes will go into the half ",
    "filled flat band at this point . a theorem by mielke , @xcite subsequently extended to nearly flat bands by mielke and tasaksi @xcite shows rigouously that for the hubbard model with a low  lying completely flat band at half  filling or less will have a fully polarized ground state .",
    "therefore , this region is due to flat  band ferromagnetism .",
    "this is substantiated by the strong dependence of the polarization on @xmath5 and @xmath92 ; there is only a small region of partial polarization surrounding the fully polarized point .",
    "we next treat the narrow strip of ferromagnetism at @xmath176 and intermediate @xmath165 .",
    "the first important issue is whether the partial polarization in this region persists in the thermodynamic limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , we plot @xmath137 as a function of @xmath177 for three different fillings .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath137 increase linearly with @xmath177 and extrapolates to a finite value as @xmath178 .",
    "one can gain some insight into the relationship between the sign of @xmath5 and the mechanism for ferromagnetism by examining the behavior of small clusters .",
    "in particular , we examine the behavior of one triangular element of the lattice , i.e.  a cluster consisting of one copper and two oxygen sites , occupied by two holes ( @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) .",
    "this cuo@xmath3 cluster can be treated analytically if spin and reflection symmetry are taken into account : the total spin can either be zero or one , and states can be symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to exchange of the oxygens .",
    "the antisymmetric @xmath181 and the symmetric @xmath181 sectors can be represented by @xmath182 matrices , the symmetric @xmath181 sector is @xmath183 , and the antisymmetric @xmath184 sector is @xmath185 .",
    "all of these matrices can be diagonalized analytically ( although it is easier , in practice , to treat the @xmath183 matrix numerically since the general solution is rather complicated ) .",
    "taking @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and varying @xmath5 , we find that for @xmath186 , the ground state is always a singlet with positive reflection symmetry .",
    "for @xmath167 , there is a competition between singlet formation , favored by direct antiferromagnetic exchange , and triplet formation , favored by third order exchange around the plaquette , which is ferromagnetic .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_e3 ] , we show the dependence of the energy of the three lowest lying states of the cuo@xmath3 cluster on @xmath187 .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath188 and @xmath189 , the ground state is a singlet with positive reflection symmetry . in the intermediate range , @xmath190",
    ", the ground state is an antisymmetric triplet , which is close in energy to the first excited state , an antisymmetric singlet .",
    "this illustrates the effect of the sign of @xmath5 on the basic triangular element of the lattice : a localized triplet is only possible for negative @xmath5 and can occur only for a certain range of @xmath187 , when there are two holes on the plaquette .",
    "while the triplet ground state of the cuo@xmath3 cluster motivates the possibility of a ferromagnetic state in this region , and provides an explanation for the minimum value of @xmath187 required , it can not provide a complete picture of this phase .",
    "in particular , the range of @xmath187 with a triplet ground state is much wider in the cuo@xmath3 cluster than the range of @xmath187 in the ferromagnetic strip in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] .",
    "when more triangles are connected together , interaction between holes in the @xmath0band can become important .",
    "the point of maximum polarization occurs when @xmath191 , i.e.  there is one hole for every second @xmath0site . at this",
    "filling , ferromagnetism based on exchange around the triangular elements would be somewhat frustrated since each @xmath0site is shared by two triangular elements .",
    "these mechanisms would tend to suppress ferromagnetism .",
    "also , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_e3 ] , the triplet ground state is close in energy to a singlet excited state even on a single triangular element .",
    "we can gain additional insight into these effects from diagonalization on clusters larger than three sites . for clusters of @xmath192 , 3 , and 4 unit cells ( 5 , 7 , and 9 total sites ) with open boundary conditions",
    ", a ferromagnetic ground state appears at all fillings in the range @xmath193 for @xmath194 , with @xmath195 ranging from -0.52 to -0.48 .",
    "however , the extent of this region in @xmath5 and the value of the polarization depends on @xmath165 . for @xmath196 , one hole in the @xmath0band , and all three sizes ,",
    "we obtain a ground  state spin at or close to the maximum possible value , up to @xmath197 ranging between -2.9 and -4.2 .",
    "this behavior is like that in the @xmath179 cuo@xmath3 cluster , since all the @xmath1holes are ferromagnetically polarized .",
    "it is also reminiscent of the ferromagnet phase in the pam , except that it is a triplet state which delocalizes rather than a singlet .",
    "similar ferromagnetic states have been found in the one - dimensional kondo lattice model with ferromagnetic exchange.@xcite    for larger @xmath165 , we obtain a ferromagnetic ground state up to @xmath197 ranging from -0.62 to -0.70 , a value in good agreement with that found in larger systems . the ground  state spin varies and depends on @xmath165 .",
    "one can understand the nature of this phase by examining the distribution of spin polarization and the spin ",
    "spin correlation function .",
    "we display the local spin polarization , @xmath198 , for parameters that yield the maximum polarization on a @xmath69 cluster in fig .",
    "[ figspindenl16 ] , taking @xmath199 , the maximal value .",
    "one can see that the holes on the @xmath1sites are _ antiferromagnetically _ aligned , which we have confirmed by examining the spin ",
    "spin correlation function .",
    "the @xmath0sites , however , all have positive polarization , and are ferromagnetically correlated with the positively polarized @xmath1sites , i.e.  with every other @xmath1site .",
    "the correlations between @xmath0sites are generally ferromagnetic .",
    "the picture is then that there is an alternation between triangular plaquettes with a ferromagnetic moment and isolated @xmath1holes antiferromagnetically aligned with the neighboring plaquettes .",
    "this phase is reminiscent of a ferrimagnet with alternating @xmath200 and @xmath184 . changing the band filling",
    "can frustrate this order , changing the amount of polarization .",
    "one domain wall is visible in fig .",
    "[ figspindenl16 ] . since this phase is due to a subtle competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange processes , it is not surprising that it is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath5 .",
    "certainly the picture of localized plaquettes breaks down as the hopping between the @xmath0sites increases .",
    "we have studied ferromagnetism in the phase diagram of the one dimensional @xmath1@xmath0 model . in the first part of this work ,",
    "we have compared the phase diagram near quarter filling of a @xmath1-@xmath0 system to the one - dimensional periodic anderson model . in both cases ,",
    "we have found a ferromagnetic region near quarter filling , but , for equivalent values of the parameters , the ferromagnetic region in the @xmath1@xmath0 system is pushed towards higher values of the coulomb interaction and higher densities .    between the antiferromagnetic state at quarter filling and the homogeneous ferromagnetic region , there is a phase - separated regime in which ferromagnetic domains are segregated from the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "the phase  separated state arises because the loss of kinetic energy of the holes due to their localization in a small region is compensated by the gain in antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "this regime is more evident in the @xmath1@xmath0 system because the antiferromagnetic coupling is stronger than in the anderson model and therefore the characteristic length for the ferromagnetic domains is smaller .",
    "nevertheless , we have presented numerical evidence for the phase  separated state for both models .",
    "recently , similar phases with a hole - rich ferromagnetic domains segregating from hole - undoped antiferromagnetic regions have been reported for models such as the one - orbital ferromagnetic kondo model and other models studied in relation with manganites .",
    "( see ref . and",
    "references therein . ) in our case , it must be emphasized that the ferromagnetism is _ not saturated _ as in the case of these models . in the case of the ferromagnetic kondo model , the phase  separated state was found near half - filling .",
    "however , it was pointed out that such a phase  separated state can arise at low densities if an antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling is added to the model .",
    "several studies in different numbers of dimensions using different methods suggest that the phase  separated state is very robust .",
    "it is also mentioned that the inclusion of longer ",
    "range coulomb repulsion can turn the phase  separated state into more exotic phases , such as striped phases with ferromagnetic domains . while we have only studied a one - dimensional system , the arguments presented for the physical mechanism of phase separation should still be valid in higher dimensionsal systems .    also , it is important to notice that the anderson model can be mapped to the antiferromagnetic kondo model for large values of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "it is well known that a ferromagnetic phase is also present in the antiferromagnetic kondo lattice model.@xcite however , there is no phase  separated state because the antiferromagnetic coupling is higher order than the mapping .",
    "we believe that an additional antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling of appropriate strength between the localized spins would induce a phase  separated state in the kondo lattice model .    in the second part of our work",
    ", we have studied the @xmath1@xmath0 model the parameters to values relevant to the cuprates .",
    "we have found that the sign of the oxygen hopping @xmath5 is crucial in determining the physics of the ground state .",
    "three disconnected ferromagnetic phases were found in the phase diagram .",
    "one phase occurs at positive @xmath5 and is similar to the ferromagnetic phase found in the pam and discussed in the first part of this work .",
    "a second phase appears for negative @xmath5 at and near quarter filling and occurs at a point at which the occupied noninteracting band has a flat dispersion .",
    "this `` flat - band '' mechanism is in agreement with a picture based on exact theorems.@xcite a third ferromagnetic phase appears for small negative @xmath5 and it is related to ferromagnetic electron exchange processes on plaquettes with a positive product of hopping integrals .",
