    "some of these candidates annihilate among themselves in the early universe with a strength to naturally provide the correct relic density today to explain the dark matter abundance in the universe .",
    "it is natural to assume then that these dm candidates go through similar annihilation processes in the present universe , wherever the dm density is sufficiently high .",
    "this is the basis for dm indirect detection experiments , which search for the annihilation products of such dark matter particle candidates .",
    "possible interesting annihilation model final end products include , but are not limited to : electrons and/or positrons , antiprotons , photons , and neutrinos .",
    "two of the most promising dm annihilation products to observe are neutrinos and photons .",
    "neutrinos and photons have the advantage that they are not charged and therefore deflected by magnetic fields in the galaxy .",
    "therefore directionality for source of origin can be preserved for indirect dm searching .",
    "recent searches for dm annihilation to neutrinos have found no excess over background towards the sun  @xcite , galactic center  @xcite , and nearby galaxies and clusters  @xcite .",
    "( for problems and possibilities concerning charged antimatter particles , see the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "promising sites for photons include our galactic halo  @xcite , the galactic center  @xcite , dwarf satellite galaxies  @xcite , clusters of galaxies @xcite , and dm substructures  @xcite .",
    "the large area telescope of the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fermi - lat )  @xcite has searched for @xmath0-rays as a signature of dm annihilation .",
    "( the strategy was outlined in @xcite . )",
    "the best regions investigated so far using the fermi telescope have been those with a large abundance of dm : the galactic center , clusters , and dwarf galaxies , some of the most dark matter dominated objects known .",
    "currently , an excess of @xmath1gev gamma rays that could be due to dm annihilation has been observed by fermi - lat near the galactic center ( gc )  @xcite . at present",
    "the true origin of these @xmath0-rays is uncertain , with alternate explanations including a new population of millisecond pulsars ( msps )  @xcite , cosmic - ray injection  @xcite , or unresolved point sources in the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "other than the galactic center , the lack of excess signal over background is used to place @xmath0-ray flux upper limits for energies between 500  mev and 500  gev .",
    "these bounds are then used to constrain the dark matter annihilation for a broad range of particle masses and annihilation channels . for current bounds on dm annihilation ,",

    "@xcite showed that fermi / lat observations of dwarf galaxies highly constrain a dark matter interpretation of excess positrons seen in ams-02@xcite , heat  @xcite , and pamela data  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on searches for @xmath0-ray signatures of dm annihilation from galaxy clusters in fermi - lat data .",
    "these include the most massive virialized dm structures in the universe and could produce substantial dm annihilation signals .",
    "we use a dark matter annihilation model within galaxy clusters from which luminosity is derived from two components .",
    "smooth \" component can be described by a radial model within each cluster .",
    "clumpy \" component is described by a large number of subhaloes predicted by numerical simulations to exist within the clusters .",
    "the annihilation signal is likely enhanced by the  clumpy \" component from the substructure , and this is expected to dominate over the smooth component by a large enhancement , or  boost \" factor .",
    "previous searches finding no evidence for gamma - rays from clusters have been used to set bounds on dm annihilation @xcite . a novel feature in the present analysis",
    "is that , whereas previous work examined at most @xmath2 clusters in total , we enlarge the sample to encompass tens of thousands of galaxy clusters .",
    "we also investigate directly these stacked data for structure in the energy distribution from the clusters ( which all are at low redshift enough to have negligible energy shift compared to the @xmath11020% instrument resolution ) .",
    "we note that our strategy is different from that of recent previous studies , where attention is instead given to angular correlations between galaxy gamma - ray data and data of other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it is more similar in spirit to a recent analysis of the fermi - lat collaboration where , however , only 16 nearby clusters were studied @xcite . in fact , one of the first analyses of this kind @xcite claimed observation of a gamma - ray line signal around 130 gev from galaxy clusters that would have been consistent with the indications from @xcite .",
    "these interesting indications have , however , not been verified with further fermi - lat data @xcite .",

    "previous work studying dm annihilation with 2mass data includes @xcite . using a combination of 2-d spatial position from 2mass together with the redshifts , tully was able to identify galaxies grouped together in clusters @xcite .",
    "given their redshifts , one knows the distances to the clusters .",
    "errors on the distance will be related to redshift space distortions ( bulk movement of galaxies ) and the uncertainty on the hubble constant .",
    "these clusters all have redshifts consistent with being nearby , within 280 mpc ( most within 50 - 100 mpc ) .",
    "the ir light from galaxies is used to determine their stellar masses , from which one can obtain the total mass using abundance matching .",
    "this mass estimation is quite accurate because of the lack of extinction in ir . for the largest masses",
    ", velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the total mass of the cluster , and for smaller groups more detailed kinematics of nearby groups can be used to find empirical estimates @xcite .",
    "the estimates should be accurate to @xmath6 .",

    ", we will thus be able to calculate the predicted @xmath0-ray flux from dark matter ( for a given wimp mass and annihilation cross - section ) .",
    "our general approach is as follows . for each cluster ,",
    "we define a region of interest containing 95% of the expected dm annihilation luminosity .",
    "we slide a bin of energy range @xmath1 twice the energy resolution of fermi - lat across our full spectrum of interest , centered at photon energies from 20 gev up to 500 gev in steps of 2 gev .",
    "we then add up all the observed photons for all the clusters for each energy window , and compare our observed photon count to the expected count .",
    "we search for a bump in the observed photon count above an expected power law background , i.e. we search for a line ( or internal bremsstrahlung @xcite ) signal at an energy equal to the wimp mass due to dm annihilation .",
    "since no excess above background is found , we use the null signal to place bounds on the dm annihilation cross section as a function of wimp mass .",

    "we must now obtain an estimate of the total j - factor .",
    "the j - factor has two contributions , the smooth halo component and the substructure ( clumpy ) component .      from simulations",
    "@xcite , for the smooth component of our dm haloes we take the navarro , frenk , and white ( nfw ) density profile @xmath16 where the characteristic density @xmath17 and radius @xmath18 are related to halo concentration and virial radius through the relations , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath22 is the cluster virial radius within which the average density is @xmath23 , and the concentration parameter @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 is the virial mass given by tully .",

    "@xmath30 is a quantity we will use for cluster selection and normalization for the boost factor described shortly .",
    "we must now account for enhancement due to substructure inside the cluster , which is expected to account for the majority of the dark matter signal from galaxy clusters @xcite . while the total sub - halo mass constitutes only 10 to 20 percent of the total halo mass ,",
    "the dm density inside the subhaloes is considerably higher density than within the smooth component of the cluster . indeed , in comparing with data , it is the substructure @xmath31 that is the dominant component in the last term of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : dphide ] ) .",
    "we define a boost factor @xmath32 as the ratio of the total integrated luminosity due to the substructure ( subscript @xmath33 ) to the total integrated luminosity due to the smooth nfw component .",
    "the notation is as above , with the total integrated flux from the substructure ( over a large enough solid angle ) as @xmath34 in the last few years much progress has been made in determining the boost factor of dark matter annihilation in clusters ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the improvements have been a result of improvements in estimating the number of substructures in a halo , and the annihilation rate in a give sub - halo(which depends strongly on the sub - halo concentration parameter ) @xcite .",
    "the best - guess boost factor per halo is between about 20 and 50 depending on the mass of the halo in our mass range , with boost increasing with cluster mass .",
    "thus in our work we use the conservative boost factor of @xcite ranging from b=20 for @xmath35 clusters to b=55 for @xmath36 clusters ( as opposed to the less conservative one of bi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which is roughly a factor of 20 or more larger ) .",
    "as substructures are to a large extent destroyed by tidal effects near the central parts of the clusters , the dm photon annihilation profile will be substantially more extended than the nfw mass profile @xcite .",
    "we are therefore using the lack of observed line signals in a relatively large region around each cluster to place bounds on the dm contribution .",
    "we consider a region of interest which will provide at least 95 percent of photons from cluster which as mentioned typically corresponds to about a degree on the sky .",
    "simulations of @xcite show that the surface brightness profile of sub - halo emission can be fitted within @xmath22 by @xmath37 following @xcite , we take for the subhalo emission surface brightness beyond the virial radius an exponential decay , @xmath38      the total annihilation profile , which is the sum of the contributions from a smooth nfw profile and the subhalo emission , is completely dominated by subhalo emission except in the very center of the cluster where the smooth nfw cusp is important .    rather than accumulating all the photons emitted by a cluster",
    ", we perform a signal cut at a radius from the center of the cluster that contains 95% of the dm signal ( from the substructure ) .",

    "we perform what is denoted as a stacked cluster approach in our data selection and analysis .",
    "previous work done using clusters to constrain dark matter annihilation into a line have taken two different approaches : a detailed cluster approach or a stacked cluster approach . for a given set of clusters , the detailed approach has stronger bounds than the stacking method . in the detailed case , each halo",
    "is carefully analyzed and finally a joint likelihood is performed on tens of objects @xcite .",
    "these authors have typically used galaxy clusters which are bright in x - ray ( also presumably also dark matter rich ) . in the stacking approach ,",

    "2mrs includes redshift information .",
    "tully s catalog of 2mrs data is optimal for our work for two reasons .",
    "first , the large number of clusters guarantees that we will find promising targets from the point of view of large dark matter annihilation signal and no coincidence with background point sources as described further below .",
    "second , in a proper analysis we would like to have detailed and unbiased statistical description of the halo properties which will play a part in the dark matter signal , namely the halo s mass and distance . some authors have previously exploited the 2mass data ( for example @xcite ) to construct galaxy cluster catalogs ; however , tully obtains improved estimates of the mass and distance to the clusters ( see @xcite for more details on the various statistical tests used in his work ) .",

    ", @xmath90 is on average on the order of 5000 km / sec . ]      now that we have explained the various elements which contribute to our overall likelihood function .",
    "we can now turn to constraining the properties of dark matter . using",
    "a delta - log - likelihood approach we can use fermi - lat data to constrain @xmath12 for a given @xmath105 by treating @xmath106 , @xmath0 , and @xmath107 as nuisance parameters , which we profile out .",
    "the delta - log - likelihood @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , & @xmath113 are the values of @xmath12 , @xmath107 , @xmath106 , & @xmath0 that jointly maximize the likelihood at a given @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are the value of @xmath107 , @xmath106 , and @xmath0 that jointly maximize the likelihood for a given @xmath105 and @xmath12 .",
    "we should note that the maximum likelihood values for @xmath106 and @xmath0 are consistent with what we would expect from galactic foreground model of the @xmath0-rays from cosmic - rays @xcite .",
    "the 1d confidence intervals in @xmath12 at the @xmath117 confidence level are determined by identifying the range of @xmath12 such that    @xmath118    in the next section we will present the upper limit of the 2@xmath119 confidence intervals ( 95.4%  confidence level ) for our 3 different selection cuts in the number of clusters . in our analysis , we did not find any significant deviations from background .",
    "we found a few regions with 2 @xmath119 fluctuations ( i.e. consistent with purely background ) .",
    "figure 10 illustrates out main results .",
    "we plot 95% confidence upper limits on dark matter cross section as a function of particle mass for @xmath120 .",
    "the lowest three curves illustrate the results of our likelihood analysis for our 3 cases : on all the clusters , the 2500 brightest clusters , and the 600 brightest clusters . for comparison , we also show the anderson _",
    "upper limits @xcite ( prior to our work , the strongest bounds from clusters ) .",
    "finally , the figure also includes upper confidence limits on the same clusters as anderson _",
    "_ using our stacking method .",
    "our results are stronger than previous cluster based results , using @xcite as a recent comparison point , but not as strong as previous galactic center based dark matter constraint results . as expected from eq.([eqn : dphide ] ) , the bounds on the cross section get weaker for higher wimp mass .",
    "we note the two most significant upward fluctuations are at around 90 gev and a bump at 350 gev , both with a significance of roughly 2 @xmath119 .",
    "the fluctuation is slightly more pronounced in the case where all the clusters are included , compared to the sub - sample constraints from the 2500 and 600 cluster sets . just as a matter of total speculation , we remind the reader that 350 gev is around half the energy of the anomalous bump found at lhc .    a few notes on the relative merits of the different cuts on the clusters . for most values of dm mass ,",
    "the constraints are stronger when including more galaxy clusters . however , at some masses , the constraints are better for smaller subsets of galaxy clusters . we attribute this to statistical fluctuation .",
    "for instance at @xmath121 gev , the 600 halo case has stronger constraints than the all halo case .",
    "for the all halo case at this energy , there are @xmath170 photons ( which we assume are background ) . given this number , for the 600 halo case",
    ", we would expect around 12 photons , but there are only 4 photons .",
    "for this case we find that the signal - to - noise ratio is 1.4 times larger for the 600 halo case and thus the bound is stronger .",
    "the top two curves of figure 10 contrast our stack method with the prior analysis of anderson etal @xcite , which studied only 16 clusters .",
    "the top two curves in the figure illustrate bounds on the same 16 clusters using our technique ( green curve ) and the anderson etal technique ( blue curve ) .",
    "their bounds are expected to be stronger because they obtain a separate likelihood for each of the clusters individually whereas we stack the clusters . in particular ,",
    "an individual likelihood for each cluster can incorporate spatial information to reduce the background from point sources and other backgrounds , whereas in our stacking method we must instead throw out clusters coincident with the 150 brightest fermi - lat @xmath0-ray point sources .",
    "most of the point source photon energies are below 100 gev , and one can see that the biggest difference between the two approaches ( green and blue curves ) is at these lower energies .",
    "indeed our results are weaker by up to an order of magnitude , yet do roughly follow the same shape as a function of wimp mass . in principle the method of @xcite does provide stronger bounds , and in the future we plan to use that approach in studying a few hundred clusters from the tully catalog .",
    "our final results ( the bottom three curves in the figure ) provide far stronger bounds than the previous work of @xcite due to the simple fact that we are studying 26,000 clusters ( rather than the 16 of @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we used @xmath0-ray observations of some 26,000 galaxy clusters in pass-7 fermi large area telescope ( lat ) data to place some of the strongest bounds to date on the cross section of dark matter particles for annihilation to a gamma - ray line , @xmath120 .",
    "the clusters were selected from the tully 2mass groups catalog . for each cluster , we defined a region of interest containing 95% of the expected dm annihilation luminosity .",
    "we slid a bin of energy range @xmath1 twice the energy resolution of fermi - lat across our full spectrum of interest .",
    "we then added up all the observed photons for all the clusters for each energy window , and compared our observed photon count to the expected count .",
    "we searched for a bump in the observed photon count above an expected power law background , i.e. a line ( or internal bremsstrahlung @xcite ) signal at an energy equal to the wimp mass due to dm annihilation . since no excess above background was found , we used the null signal to place bounds on the dm annihilation cross section as a function of wimp mass for @xmath13 between 20 and 500 gev .",
    "we found @xmath122 upward fluctuations most prominently at @xmath1350 gev , but these are clearly not significant enough to claim detection .",
    "we have improved on the previous best limits provided from galaxy clusters by a factor of 5 to 10 ( depending on the dm mass ) .",
    "our cluster based constraints are not yet as strong as bounds placed using the galactic center , although a less conservative `` boost factor '' from cluster substructure than the one we have chosen could strengthen our bounds considerably .",
    "our analysis , given this choice of possible boost , is not yet sensitive enough to fully rule out typical realistic dm candidates , especially if the gamma - ray line is not a dominant annihilation mode .    in the analysis in this paper we stacked the clusters . in the future , a stronger bound may be obtained by performing a different analysis , namely determining an individual likelihood function for each of several hundred clusters ( this approach was previously used by @xcite for 16 clusters ) .",
    "the latter technique can incorporate spatial information to reduce the background .",
    "additional work for the future would be to repeat our analysis with fermi - lat pass 8 data instead of pass 7 data , which may yield stronger constraints ( the pass 8 data were not available when we started this work ) .",
    "one could also perform a joint likelihood analysis of both the nearby clusters in conjunction with the galactic center .    our improvement on the previous limits provided from galaxy clusters by a factor of 5 to 10 shows promising future use of galaxy clusters as a viable source for placing further bounds on the particle physics of dark matter .",
    "on general merits , by looking at clusters of galaxies which have been characterized comprehensively by tully , we now have the strongest constraints on dark matter annihilation to a line in clusters of galaxies . in future work",
    ", we also plan a similar study on other dm annihilation channels , which will produce a broader range of photon energies .",
