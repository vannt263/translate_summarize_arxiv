    "in this paper we study the motion of an axisymmetric , current carrying relativistic string loop in the background of a kerr black hole .",

    "our investigation is loosely motivated by the problem of the production of collimated astrophysical jets of matter .",
    "systems that exhibit collimated jets range from accreting young stars , neutron stars and black holes to supermassive black holes in quasars and active galactic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "magnetized plasmas interacting with an accretion disk are believed to play a central role in jet production , but despite much work and many prosposals for the mechanism , the process is still not yet well understood .",
    "such plasmas are governed by magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , a complicated nonlinear field theory . under some circumstances ,",
    "plasmas exhibit associated string - like behavior , either via the dynamics of magnetic field lines embedded in the plasma  @xcite , or in the dynamics of relatively thin isolated flux tubes of plasma which can be approximately described by an effective one - dimensional string  @xcite . in either of these cases",
    ", the string would be described by an energy density and a tension , and might be carrying currents of mass and/or charge .",
    "the hope is that some essential aspects of the physics could be captured by string dynamics , which is tremendously simpler than mhd .",

    "we restrict attention to a relatively simple class of strings , namely axisymmetric loops characterized by a constant tension and a conserved mass current on the string worldsheet , in order to begin developing some insight into the factors influencing the string dynamics .",
    "this could be generalized in future work to allow for different equations of state , coupling of a charge current to an external electromagnetic field  @xcite , and deviations from axisymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the string tension prevents a string loop from expanding beyond some radius , and the worldsheet current can produce an angular momentum barrier preventing the loop from collapsing into the black hole .",
    "thus , depending on its energy and current , a string may be trapped in a toroidal region surrounding the black hole , or its motion may be confined to a cylindrical shell that extends to infinity . in the latter case , one can envisage processes wherein internal energy of the string is converted into translational kinetic energy via the propagation on the black hole background .",
    "this is one of the phenomena we aim to understand .",
    "the other key question is what role may be played by the spin of the black hole , as a result of the associated dragging of inertial frames .",

    "d.   a region inside the shaded area and below the dashed red line .",
    "the boundaries of the motion are the same in number as in the previous case , but with a qualitative difference : the inner and the outer boundaries at higher values of @xmath141 meet at a certain value of @xmath140 and together form a closed curve .",
    "therefore , there is also effectively a boundary in the @xmath140 motion and the string can be trapped in some toroidal volume .",
    "there is a subtle point that should not pass unnoticed : depending on the initial conditions , a string with given @xmath68 and @xmath78 which corresponds to a point in the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ ejsq ] can either be moving in between the inner and outer boundary at higher @xmath141 s , or it can be inside the second outer boundary at smaller @xmath141 s .",
    "finally it should be stressed that a second outer boundary at small @xmath141 s can only exist when there @xmath148 has a maximum outside the horizon .",
    "+   +    next we give in fig .",
    "[ eoutfig ] a few examples of plots of the boundaries of motion corresponding to given initial conditions and current ( or energy ) , for @xmath124 .",
    "the qualitative nature of these boundary plots can be read off from fig .",

    "[ ejqsw1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ eoutfig2 ] , one can see the region closer to the black hole : for the @xmath176 cases , there exists a third boundary , which is an outer boundary .",
    "this is in accordance with the form of @xmath148 in figs .",
    "[ ebw0 ] and [ ebw1 ] and highlights the subtlety discussed above right after outlining the various regions of fig .",

    "the string is trapped in a toroidal volume , and for @xmath175 there is only an outer boundary .",

    "( we do not plot the @xmath179 case since there is no energy for which there will be an internal boundary for the motion . ) in this case , the inner boundary of motion lies within the ergoregion .    before closing this section",
    "it is worth stressing once more the similarity between the contour plots of the boundaries of motion for a newtonian elastic spinning ring presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and the boundaries of motion for the relativistic strings presented in this section .      in this subsection",
    "we look at examples of individual trajectories , and in particular we exhibit processes whereby a string is ejected along the axis , with some of the initial internal energy of the string converted to translational kinetic energy . to this end , we employed numerical integration with mathematica 6.0 to solve the equations of motion .",
    "as already mentioned we consider here two different initial conditions : one for which the string starts outside the ergoregion , and one for which the string starts at @xmath126 , which lies well within the ergoregion ( points @xmath123 and @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ figinit ] respectively ) .",
    "starting at rest from these initial positions , there are three types of trajectories , as indicted by the types of boundaries of motion : those that are trapped inside an outer boundary with no inner boundary and simply fall in across the horizon , those that are trapped in some toroidal volume , and those that can reach spatial infinity along the direction of the axis .",
    "the trajectories of the first type display no interesting features so we do not present any explicit examples of them here.s exists as well , as discussed earlier .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when the boundaries of motion are those of fig .",
    "[ e50w0zoom ] or fig .",
    "[ e17w0 ] and the string start at rest at @xmath124 . ]     +    we begin by discussing bound trajectories .",
    "the energies we considered previously do not lead to confined motion for a string starting at @xmath123 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ eoutfig ] : for the cases where there can be confined motion , namely figs .",
    "[ e17w0 ] and [ e50w1 ] , our initial position lies on the innermost outer boundary .",
    "thus the string would fall straight into the black hole .",
    "however , for other energies there can be confined motion for a string starting at @xmath123 . also , according to fig .  [ e8wm1 ]",
    "we have already found an example where the string s motion is confined when it starts from @xmath125 , _ i.e. _  inside the ergoregion . in fig .",
    "[ boundmotionfig ] we present the motion of a string starting from @xmath123 with @xmath180 and that of a string starting from @xmath125 with @xmath181 for qualitative comparison .",
    "both cases refer to @xmath168 ( co - rotation ) . in both cases",
    "the strings move somewhat randomly , without following any clear pattern .",
    "[ e9wm1motz ] and [ e8wm1inmotz ] focus on the area inside and around the ergoregion .",
    "the string is sometimes pulled by gravity rather sharply back toward the equatorial plane after reflecting from the inner boundary .",
    "we have monitored the accuracy by running the code backward in time from the point the forward run ended , and checking how closely this backward run approaches the initial conditions . in the plots presented we stop the simulation before the accuracy becomes lower than @xmath182 . for trajectories starting from @xmath123 and for @xmath183 for trajectories starting from @xmath125 ( provided that the string did not end up in the inside the horizon before that time ) before dropping below the required accuracy . remarkably , for the  focused \" trajectories , such as those in fig .",
    "[ focusfig ] , the accuracy was still two orders of magnitude higher than our minimum requirement at @xmath184 .",
    "note that @xmath61 is the coordinate time on the worldsheet . ]",
    "+    before proceeding further to trajectories that can reach spatial infinity , there is another interesting feature of confined motion which should not be missed . in fig .",
    "[ focusfig ] we present confined trajectories starting from @xmath123 with @xmath181 and from @xmath125 with @xmath185 , always for @xmath168 .",
    "there is evidently some remarkable  focusing \" of the motion close to the equatorial plane in both cases , and a very regular pattern is generated . in figs .",
    "[ e8wm1motz ] and [ e5.5wm1inmotz ] we have distorted the aspect ratio in order to make manifest the pattern that arises in the motion .",
    "we do not understand why these cases are so different from those shown in fig .",
    "[ boundmotionfig ] .",
    "the focussing can not be explained by considering only the boundary of allowed motion ( dotted curve ) as inferred using the effective potential .",
    "the appearance of a lissajous - like pattern indicates that when the string stays close to the equatorial plane the motion becomes similar to complex periodic oscillation .    finally , we discuss trajectories that can reach spatial infinity . in fig .",
    "[ e17wm1mot ] we have plotted the trajectory of a string starting from @xmath123 with @xmath177 and @xmath168 . after a couple of oscillations around the equatorial plane , which are exhibited more clearly in fig .",
    "[ e17wm1motz ] , the string escapes along the @xmath105 direction .",
    "the behavior of a string starting from @xmath125 with @xmath186 and @xmath168 is quite similar . in both cases ,",
    "there is some conversion of internal energy of the string into kinetic energy along the @xmath140 axis .",
    "+    another interesting class of non - confined trajectories are the scattering trajectories found by larsen in ref .",
    "an example of such a trajectory for a string with @xmath187 , @xmath168 , and initial conditions @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 is shown in fig .",
    "[ scattering ] .",
    "the string comes in along the axis and after a couple of bounces around the black hole , which can be better appreciated in fig .",
    "[ scattzoom ] , escapes to infinity out the other side .",
    "the scattering in this case reduces the mean radius in the @xmath141 direction , signaling a conversion of internal energy to kinetic energy along the @xmath140 direction , as explained below in the next subsection , [ ejection ] .    in figs .",
    "[ collapse ] and [ collapsezoom ] we show a case where the string actually falls into the black hole instead if getting scattered . for this case ,",
    "@xmath192 , @xmath168 , and the initial conditions are @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath193 and @xmath191 . in this case",
    "the string has more energy than a string at rest on the horizon and , hence , its motion has no inner boundary close to the equatorial plane ( _ cf .",
    "_  the discussion in section [ boundaries ] about figs .  [ ebwm1 ] and [ ejsq ] ) .",
    "+      as noted , on some trajectories internal energy of the string can be converted to translational kinetic energy along the axis . to characterize this energy we may associate a relativistic boost factor @xmath194 with the asymptotic string , where @xmath195 is the energy of the string in its center of mass frame at infinity . in the center of mass frame ,",
    "all velocities vanish at the inner and outer boundaries @xmath196 of oscillation , so we may use ( [ v0flat ] ) to obtain @xmath197 . eliminating @xmath78",
    "we find @xmath198 .",
    "thus , using the present notation @xmath141 for the cylindrical radius , we have = . with this relation",
    "the @xmath199 factors corresponding to the processes shown in the previous examples can be computed .",
    "for example , for the @xmath177 case in fig .  [ freefig ] we find @xmath200 , or @xmath201 , and for the @xmath186 case we find @xmath202 , or @xmath203 .",
    "we expect that these mildly relativistic boost factors are typical of what one can expect in generic cases .",
    "the black hole spin enters the string dynamics via the @xmath139 dependence of the various metric coefficients .",
    "while the value of @xmath139 , certainly affects the boundaries of motion and dynamics when other quantities are held fixed , we do not see any systematic qualitative effect that can be attributed uniquely to the spin .",
    "that is , by varying the current , energy , and location of the string similar effects can be produced .",
    "this statement is based both on examining cases ( not explicitly reported here ) for which @xmath132 , as well as by comparing the behaviors for different values of @xmath76 .",
    "the dynamics only depends on @xmath76 when @xmath139 is non - zero , but the effect of changing @xmath76 can also generally be reproduced by changing other quantities .    the one exception to this statement concerns the issue of negative killing energy states . in the presence of black hole spin",
    ", there is an ergoregion , inside of which such states exist for point particles . the same is true for the string , though the mechanism is a bit different .",
    "for a particle , negative angular momentum orbits in the ergoregion have negative killing energy .",
    "longitudinal motion of a string is meaningless , so it is not the  orbital \" motion , but rather the current on the worldsheet that can access negative energy states . in particular , the second term on the right hand side of the energy ( [ vkerr0 ] ) , i.e.   @xmath204 , is negative there when the angular momentum @xmath205 is negative . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ vkerr0 ] ) vanishes at the horizon , so the energy is certainly negative there when @xmath206 .",
    "the negative energy states extend out a certain distance ( which depends on the values of @xmath76 and @xmath78 ) from the horizon into the ergoregion . for example",
    ", one can see in fig .",
    "[ ejqsw1 in ] the negative energy states at @xmath138 in the case @xmath179 , except for the smallest values of @xmath78 .",
    "( for the limiting case of zero tension and @xmath179 , there are negative energy states everywhere in the ergoregion . )",
    "as stated in the introduction , although our primary aim in this paper was to study the motion of a current carrying strings in a kerr background as an interesting dynamical system , our investigation was also loosely motivated by the problem of the production of collimated jets in astrophysics .",
    "we should therefore like to comment on what might be the relevance of our findings to astrophysical systems .",
    "first of all , the current carried by the string in the model need not represent an electric current , but it can just serve to model the role of angular momentum . in this sense , a current carrying string can serve as an idealization of some mhd matter configuration with tension and angular momentum , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "simplistic as it may be , this allows for the identification of a mechanism that might conceivably be relevant : the tension sets a barrier for the motion that keeps the string within a certain radius from the axis of symmetry , while the angular momentum sets a barrier that keeps the string outside a certain radius .",
    "gravity deforms these barriers creating either a closed region in which the string is trapped , or a  restricted path \" that leads to motion along the symmetry axis . if some physical process were to  feed \" such a system with strings close to the equatorial plane , then under the right circumstances one might end up with a very well collimated stream of strings moving out along the axis of symmetry . of course",
    ", the axisymmetry we are imposing might be too restrictive , and in particular , even if a string started out approximately axisymmetric , it might wobble or twist and reconnect . perhaps the tension could act to suppress such effects , but this requires further investigation .    still , one may speculate that the general flavor of the mechanism exhibited by the strings might generically be present in a class of astrophysical systems .",
    "for instance , given a system with an accretion disk , plasma leaving the inner edge of the disk would carry some angular momentum , and plasma flux tubes do possess a significant tension ( which however is not constant but grows in proportion to the length ) .",
    "it might even be that differential rotation can stretch such a tube , storing in it a large amount of electromagnetic energy before launching it towards the axis .",
    "external magnetic fields , which have been left out of consideration in our initial study , might also play an important role in the subsequent dynamics .",
    "it remains to be seen whether aspects of this picture could actually be astrophysically relevant .",
    "regarding the energetics , it should be noted that the mechanism described here does not lead to significant ( ultra - relativistic ) acceleration of the strings .",
    "while internal energy of the string can be converted to kinetic energy of motion along the axis of symmetry , the resulting @xmath207 factors in the examples we studied are rather close to unity , the largest velocity we reported being @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , even if the mechanism we have found is somehow relevant to collimation , it does not appear able to explain the acceleration of relativistic jets .",
    "the acceleration would have to occur due to the presence of electromagnetic fields , or to some other mechanism .",
    "in particular , the process discussed here does not tap into the rotational energy of the black hole , which is a prime candidate for the source of ultra - relativistic jet energy .    on the contrary , the collimation effect we find persists even at the newtonian level , which may be advantageous : collimated jets seem to be present not only around black holes , but also around objects with significantly weaker gravitational fields , such as accreting young stars for instance  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if there is a common mechanism for the collimation , it should not depend on relativistic effects .",
    "hence , the effects described here could perhaps be part of a more involved process that collimates and drives astrophysical jets .",
    "we have studied the motion of relativistic , current carrying strings moving axisymmetrically on the background of a kerr black hole .",
    "first the equations of motion and conserved quantities in the conformal gauge were found .",
    "next , we determined how the energy of a string that is instantaneously at rest depends on the current and the position of the string .",
    "contours of this quantity determine boundaries of the possible motion of a string with that energy and current .",
    "we compared this analysis with that for a newtonian elastic ring moving around a point mass , and found that system to be qualitatively similar .    by considering a number of examples and various plots of the relevant functions ,",
    "the possible types of motion were mapped out .",
    "regions of parameters for which the string falls into the black hole , or is trapped in a toroidal volume , or can escape to infinity , were identified . after this general analysis",
    ", we examined representative trajectories found by numerical integration , illustrating various interesting behaviors .",
    "in particular , we found that a string can start out at rest near the equatorial plane and , after bouncing around , be ejected out along the axis , some of its internal ( elastic or rotational kinetic ) energy having been transformed into translational kinetic energy .",
    "the resulting velocity can be an order unity fraction of the speed of light .",
    "finally , we addressed the question of possible astrophysical significance of this system as a simple model of mhd plasma flux tubes , which might conceivably play a role in jet formation and collimation .",
