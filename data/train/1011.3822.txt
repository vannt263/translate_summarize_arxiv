    "in recent years , gauge - string duality @xcite has been useful in exploring properties of strongly coupled field theories in regimes where their duals may be truncated to classical gravity . in particular , application of gauge - string duality to the hydrodynamic regime of these field theories",
    "has led to a `` fluid - gravity correspondence '' @xcite-@xcite .",
    "properties of solutions of classical gravity then lead to predictions for interesting properties of the dual fluid , the most celebrated example being the ratio of shear viscosity to the entropy density of a conformal fluid @xcite .    in this note",
    "we use the fluid  gravity correspondence in the opposite direction .",
    "we use properties of supersonic fluid flows to predict interesting properties of fluctuations around a class of deformed black brane spacetimes in asymptotically @xmath1 spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes are duals of inhomogeneous flows of conformal fluids where the fluid velocity exceeds the speed of sound in some region .",
    "unruh @xcite showed that such flows lead to the formation of an `` acoustic ergoregion '' and , under suitable conditions , to an `` acoustic horizon '' .",
    "the same physics which leads to hawking radiation from black holes in general relativity now leads to a hawking - like radiation of quantized sound waves ( or phonons ) with a thermal spectrum , the temperature being proportional to the gradient of the velocity field at the acoustic horizon @xcite .",
    "even when an acoustic horizon is not present , the presence of an ergoregion leads to characteristic properties like superradiance @xcite .",
    "fluid configurations with such acoustic horizons have been termed `` dumb holes '' , and have been proposed as possible experimentally realizable systems for testing the physics of hawking radiation in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "we will show that the gravity duals of such supersonic flows are non - static black holes .",
    "the duals of sound waves are then certain quasinormal modes around such black holes , and it follows from the fluid - gravity correspondence that at the quantum level one should find a hawking - like radiation of these modes with an approximately thermal spectrum @xcite .",
    "this hawking - like radiation is distinct from the usual hawking radiation associated with the black hole horizon , and would be present even when the background black hole is extremal and hence at zero temperature .",
    "the temperature of this quasinormal mode radiation depends on the properties of a `` quasinormal mode horizon '' , which is an extension into the bulk of the acoustic horizon of the boundary fluid .",
    "it should be emphasized that this phenomenon could have been found purely in general relativity ( or its supergravity extensions relevant to our considerations ) by studying the fluctuation problem around these non - static black holes .",
    "however , without the fluid gravity correspondence and knowledge of acoustic hawking radiation , there would not have been an obvious motivation to look for quasinormal mode horizons in non - static black brane backgrounds .    while we believe that the phenomenon of hawking radiation or super - radiance of quasinormal modes is quite general , it turns out to be rather difficult to come up with examples within a controlled approximation scheme .",
    "the simplest and perhaps most interesting background where such a phenomenon could be present is a kerr black hole in asymptotically @xmath2 spacetime .",
    "the dual of such a background is a rotating conformal fluid on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "there is a regime of parameters of the black hole geometry for which the dual rotating fluid has supersonic velocities in a band around the equator of the @xmath3 , thus producing an ergoregion for sound modes .",
    "the physics of sound waves around such a rotating fluid background would have a dual description in terms of quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations around the kerr black hole in @xmath2 .",
    "however , this flow has vorticity , and the existence of acoustic hawking radiation has been demonstrated mostly for irrotational flow . in the presence of nonzero vorticity , the sound modes get mixed up badly with other modes and analysis becomes difficult @xcite .",
    "the situation simplifies , however , if the flow is irrotational .",
    "as shown in @xcite for non - relativistic perfect fluids , and extended to relativistic perfect fluids in @xcite , the velocity potential then obeys the wave equation for a minimally coupled massless scalar field propagating on a curved background , the metric of which is determined by the underlying flow .",
    "the mathematical problem of quantizing sound waves or phonons around such a flow is then quite similar to that of quantizing a massless scalar field in an ordinary black hole background .",
    "this implies the existence of an acoustic analog of hawking radiation .",
    "known examples of supersonic flows of perfect fluids often lead to infinite `` acoustic surface gravity '' ( which is proportional to the gradient of the velocity at the acoustic horizon ) .",
    "the presence of viscosity usually regulates this divergence and renders it finite @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of viscosity , however , makes the analysis complicated .    in this paper",
    "we find simple examples of acoustic horizons in _ ideal _ relativistic conformal fluids with finite acoustic hawking temperature .",
    "the simplest example involves a fluid moving in a background spacetime of the form ds_b^2 = -dt^2 + dz^2 + r(z)^2(d^2 + ^2d^2 ) [ intro-1 ] where @xmath4 is a slowly varying function which has the behavior @xmath5 as @xmath6 . is given in the discussion above eqn.([deriv_curv ] ) .",
    "@xmath4 is some function in the metric ( [ intro-1 ] ) , for which all invariants constructed out of the curvature and its derivatives are small compared to the basic scale in the problem . ]",
    "the fluid flow is steady and the only nonzero component of the fluid velocity is @xmath7 , with all derivatives bounded .",
    "starting with @xmath8 at @xmath9 we will show that @xmath10 reaches the speed of sound  producing an acoustic horizon  at minima of @xmath4 . if the function @xmath4 has only one minimum , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath11 , the assumption of a smooth solution of the fluid equations of motion implies that the fluid velocity continues to increase beyond the acoustic horizon until it reaches the speed of light at @xmath12 .",
    "however , if @xmath4 has multiple extrema , _",
    "e.g. _ two minima separated by a maximum , we will find smooth flows where the fluid velocity reaches a maximum supersonic value at the maximum of @xmath4 and then decreases , then turns subsonic at the second minimum , and finally reaches zero at @xmath12 .",
    "sound waves can not escape to the asymptotic region @xmath13 from beyond the first acoustic horizon ( which is therefore like a black hole horizon ) , and can not cross the second acoustic horizon ( which behaves more like a white hole horizon ) from the @xmath14 asymptotic region .",
    "we also study flows in a warped @xmath15 geometry ds^2 = -dt^2 + r(z)^2 ( d_1 ^ 2+d_2 ^ 2 ) + dz^2 [ intro-3 ] and find very similar phenomena .    the acoustic hawking radiation that arises when the sound modes of these flows are quantized will be easiest to detect if the acoustic hawking temperature @xmath16 is larger than the ambient temperature of the fluid , @xmath17 . for an uncharged conformal fluid ,",
    "the only scale is the temperature , so that hydrodynamics is valid only when all derivatives are small compared to the temperature .",
    "however @xmath16 itself is proportional to the gradient of the velocity field , @xmath18 .",
    "thus it is not possible to have hawking radiation at a temperature higher than the ambient temperature in an uncharged conformal fluid .",
    "we will therefore look for _ charged _ fluid solutions satisfying the rather stringent criterion of @xmath19 , in order to ensure detectability of hawking radiation .",
    "note that the solutions we will find all have well - defined uncharged limits and satisfy all criteria other than @xmath19 under the replacement of @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ".    we will consider conformal fluids with global charge density @xmath22 and conjugate chemical potential @xmath23 .",
    "for such a fluid in equilibrium , the ambient temperature can be made to vanish provided the charge density is chosen properly . in analogy with the gravitational duals of such fluids considered below , we will call such a fluid `` extremal ''",
    ". we will consider _ isentropic _ flows of such a fluid where the charge density @xmath22 , energy density @xmath24 and the velocity vary slowly ( in a sense defined precisely below ) but whose variations can themselves be @xmath25 . in an isentropic flow ,",
    "the entropy density per unit charge density is , however , a constant .",
    "for such flows @xmath26 where @xmath24 is the energy density .",
    "then @xmath27 is the only independent energy scale in the theory .",
    "@xmath28 is in general a function of the chemical potential @xmath23 and the temperature @xmath29 .",
    "as shown below , the isentropic condition allows us to keep the local temperature @xmath29 to be always much smaller than @xmath28 , even though the other hydrodynamic quantities can change by @xmath25 . in the limit of very small temperature @xmath30",
    "one would expect that the hydrodynamic approximation is valid so long as all gradients are small compared to @xmath28 .",
    "we will show that it is consistently possible to construct fluid flows described above with all gradients @xmath31 and all curvature invariants much smaller than @xmath28 , thus ensuring @xmath32 .",
    "the spacetimes ( [ intro-1 ] ) and ( [ intro-3 ] ) may each be regarded as the boundary of an asymptotically @xmath2 near - extremal charged black brane geometry which is deformed due to a nonzero boundary curvature . for generic spacetimes with arbitrary @xmath4 , the boundary metric might not admit a smooth bulk dual .",
    "however it has been shown in @xcite that for slow - enough variations in the boundary metric , the dual geometry is regular up to the bulk horizon and free of other singularities .",
    "our solution will admit a smooth bulk dual as long as all invariants constructed out of the boundary curvature and its derivatives are much smaller than the radius of the outer horizon @xmath33 in @xmath1 units.one should note that in spite of being slowly - varying , the deformations can still be large .",
    "very close to extremality , @xmath34 , so that this condition is in fact the condition for validity of hydrodynamics in the boundary theory . in the second example , the boundary metric has two compact directions .",
    "this means that the nature of the dual geometry depends on the size of the compact directions compared to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we will choose @xmath35 so that the dual is a near - extremal black brane rather than an @xmath1 soliton with a small temperature .    a fluid flow profile in the boundary theory",
    "is then described by a normalizable deformation of this bulk metric .",
    "we construct the deformed bulk metric using a derivative expansion , following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the straightforward derivative expansion breaks down in `` tubes '' of constant retarded time where the geometry becomes exactly extremal ; therefore , we consider fluid flows where the local temperature is small but nonzero .",
    "we then consider the class of linearized fluctuations around this background geometry - quasinormal modes - which are dual to sound waves in the presence of the corresponding fluid flow .",
    "note that while the deformations of the bulk metric due to a nontrivial @xmath4 and a nontrivial velocity profile @xmath7 are typically large , the quasinormal mode amplitudes are small .",
    "the behavior of the quasinormal modes clearly shows that at leading order in the derivative expansion , the acoustic horizon of the fluid extends into the bulk in the following sense .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the radial coordinate in the @xmath1 space and let @xmath37 be the location of the acoustic horizon in the boundary flow .",
    "we find that for any value of @xmath36 , these quasinormal modes suffer an infinite blue - shift as we approach @xmath38 : modes which travel along the direction of the fluid flow are smooth at @xmath39 , while the modes which travel in the direction opposite to the flow have rapid oscillations .",
    "thus , in an eikonal approximation these quasinormal modes can not cross the quasinormal mode horizon at @xmath37 , which extends radially from the acoustic horizon into the bulk .",
    "standard arguments imply that upon quantization corrections in the @xmath40 gauge theory on the boundary . ] , one would find a thermal distribution of these quasinormal modes with a temperature @xmath16 , which is the gravity dual of the acoustic hawking radiation in the fluid .",
    "only these specific quasinormal modes perceive the quasinormal mode horizon ; other modes can cross it with ease .",
    "by the same token , the thermal distribution will be made up only of these quasinormal modes ; it exists independently of ( and at a different temperature from ) the usual hawking radiation associated with the event horizon of the background black brane .",
    "our discussion is restricted to the lowest non - trivial order in the derivative expansion , which is consistent with the perfect fluid approximation .",
    "however we expect that the physical consequences should survive higher derivative corrections .",
    "furthermore our discussion of _ fluctuations _ , both in the boundary fluid and in bulk gravity , is restricted to the linearized limit .",
    "we do not address the effect of nonlinear interactions of the sound waves and other modes .",
    "admittedly , our setup is a bit contrived and is meant to provide a simple toy model in which this novel gravitational phenomenon can be studied in a controlled fashion .",
    "we expect , however , that the phenomenon is quite general and would be present in more interesting situations ( _ e.g. _ the kerr black hole mentioned above ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ acoustic_rel ] ,",
    "we give a self - contained discussion of acoustic metrics and dumb holes for conformal relativistic fluids . in section [ bulk ] , we describe the bulk dual . in section [ regime_validity ]",
    "we discuss the regime of validity of our solutions .",
    "in this section we derive the equation governing the propagation of sound around gradient flows of a perfect relativistic conformal fluid . for such fluids , the pressure @xmath41 and",
    "the energy density @xmath24 are related by p = .",
    "[ defconformal ] for a charged conformal fluid with charge density @xmath22 , there is an additional equation of state @xmath42 , or equivalently @xmath43 , that relates the energy , entropy and charge densities .  .",
    "] we will eventually be considering charged fluids with gravity duals , and will write down an explicit equation of state for such fluids in section ( [ bulk ] ) .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics reads [ 1stlaw ] d = tds+dq , where @xmath29 and @xmath23 are the intensive quantities temperature and chemical potential respectively and can be obtained from the equation of state by taking derivatives : [ t_mu ] t=.|_q , = .|_s . for a homogeneous system , it follows from extensivity that all thermodynamic variables are related by a gibbs - duhem relationship , which using ( [ defconformal ] ) may be written as = ts+q .",
    "[ gibbsduhem ]    in the following , we will define a quantity @xmath28 with dimensions of energy by p = = c^4 , [ ttandrr ] where @xmath44 is a dimensionless constants depending on the underlying system .",
    "@xmath28 will be a function of @xmath29 and @xmath23 ( or @xmath22 ) , which reduces to @xmath29 in the uncharged limit .",
    "our fluids will also admit a zero - temperature , finite-@xmath23 limit , close to which @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath28 sets the energy scale of our conformal fluid , and will play an important role in defining limits in which our approximations are valid .",
    "the equations of motion of fluid dynamics are conservation of the energy momentum tensor and conservation of the currents associated with any conserved charges , including the conserved particle number : @xmath45 the stress tensor @xmath46 depends on the @xmath47 independent components of velocity @xmath48 , the energy density , the pressure and their derivatives .",
    "the currents @xmath49 additionally depend on the densities @xmath50 of the conserved charges . to leading order in the derivative expansion , [ tmunu ]",
    "t^ & = & pg^ + ( + p)u^u^= c^4 ( g^ + 4u^u^ ) + [ current ] j_i^&= & q_i u^. here @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "conformal invariance implies that the stress tensor is traceless . in a general curved background",
    "there is a trace anomaly ; however this is a higher order effect in the derivative expansion and we have ignored it .",
    "we have also ignored the viscous and diffusive terms  which are again higher order in the derivative expansion ",
    "and we therefore work in the perfect fluid limit .",
    "in addition we will also restrict attention to the case of a single charge of density @xmath53 .",
    "the parallel component of the equations of motion ( [ fluid_eom ] ) , @xmath54 , leads to the conservation law [ entropy ] _ ( ^3u^ ) = 0 . in the uncharged case",
    "@xmath55 is proportional to the entropy density of the fluid and the above equation is the conservation of the entropy current .",
    "the perpendicular component @xmath56 ( where the projector @xmath57 ) gives [ perp ] u^_(u^)=-^which can be manipulated to yield [ perp_vort ] _ ( u _ ) -_(u _ ) = - _ , where @xmath58 is the vorticity of the fluid . for any scalar function @xmath59 . in ( [ potential ] ) @xmath59 is simply the temperature @xmath29 . ] therefore , for an irrotational flow , we can define a potential @xmath60 such that [ potential ] u_= _ .",
    "thus to solve for irrotational flows of an uncharged fluid , it is sufficient to solve ( [ potential ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) , along with an additional equation like ( [ current ] ) for every conserved charge .",
    "note that since @xmath61 , the equation ( [ potential ] ) may be used to express @xmath28 in terms of the potential @xmath60 ^2 = - ( _ ) ( ^ ) [ ttform ] so that @xmath60 determines both @xmath62 and @xmath28 .    in general ,",
    "the charge density @xmath22 is not related to @xmath28 .",
    "we will , however , restrict ourselves to solutions where @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "the current conservation equations ( [ fluid_eom ] ) are then automatically solved once the equation ( [ entropy ] ) is solved . for such flows",
    "@xmath64 is the only independent dimensionful quantity that governs the flow .",
    "@xmath65 determines all the hydrodynamic quantities once the ratio @xmath63 is specified .",
    "in fact , substituting ( [ ttform ] ) in ( [ potential ] ) and finally in ( [ entropy ] ) one gets a single complicated nonlinear differential equation for @xmath66 .",
    "although the restriction that @xmath67 might seem quite ad hoc at this stage , for fluids with gravity duals that we will be considering in section ( [ bulk ] ) , this will turn out to imply that the flow is _",
    "isentropic_. isentropic flows also allow us to parametrically control the temperature of the fluid . as discussed above ,",

    "the equation ( [ tmurelations ] ) shows that once we fix the ratio @xmath68 so that @xmath29 is small at some time , it remains parametrically small at all times , since the change of @xmath69 is of order 1 .",
    "isentropic sound waves in such a gradient flow are described by small amplitude fluctuations of the velocity potential @xmath70 .",

    "note that the metric factors vanish or become singular at @xmath82 which precisely corresponds to the speed of sound @xmath83 .",

    "we now apply the results of the preceding subsection to construct gravitational duals of the fluid flows with acoustic horizons that were studied in section 2 .",
    "these flows are special in several ways : first , the background spacetime metric of the fluid is of the form ( [ ds2r(z ) ] ) or ( [ ds2t2 ] ) where the only inhomogeneity is in the @xmath85 direction .",
    "second , both the background flow and the sound wave fluctuations have vanishing vorticity .",
    "third , the background flows as well perturbations around them are isentropic .",
    "it follows from the isentropic condition that the quantities @xmath186 and @xmath187 are constants . as argued above ( see discussion following equation ( [ ttform ] ) ) , for isentropic flows there is just one length scale , and all quantities are related to this length scale by dimensional analysis . in particular , the dimensionless quantities @xmath186 and @xmath187 must be constant .",
    "in addition , the inhomogeneous parts of all quantities which appear in the bulk metric and the gauge field are determined in terms of a single scalar field @xmath188 .    as discussed in the introduction , in order for the acoustic hawking radiation to be detectable we need to consider fluids which have a very small ambient temperature .",
    "this means that the constant quantities @xmath187 and @xmath186 need to be close to their extremal values , @xmath189 and therefore @xmath190 . while the various quantities like @xmath191 can change by @xmath192 amounts ( only their derivatives are small ) , the isentropic condition ensures that if the fluid temperature is initially small it will remain small ( see the discussion in section 2 above ) .    to construct the background fluid flow , we simply need to insert the velocity potential @xmath193 for the solutions of section 2 into the general metric and gauge field in ( [ dual-7 ] ) and ( [ dual-8 ] ) .",
    "the conditions of vanishing vorticity and isentropic flow simplify these general expressions somewhat .",
    "the most drastic simplification appears in the expression for the gauge field , equation ( [ dual-8 ] ) .",
    "in fact the first order corrections ( in the derivative expansion ) to the gauge field vanish for isentropic gradient flows .",
    "to see this we note first that @xmath194 can be replaced by @xmath195 in the expression @xmath196 of ( [ dual-8a ] ) . then using @xmath197 we get l_= g_^[- _ _ + _ _ ] = 0 due to antisymmetry of the epsilon symbol .",
    "the third term on the rhs of ( [ dual-8 ] ) also vanishes , as can be seen by applying the isentropic condition @xmath198constant and the relations ( [ potential ] ) and ( [ ttform ] ) to the expression p^__+ 3 ( u^_u _ ) & = & 3a + & = & 3a = 0 [ dual-15 ] thus , to first order in the derivative expansion , the bulk gauge field is given by the first term of the right hand side of ( [ dual-8 ] ) , which is just the term which would have resulted from a simple boost of the original black brane solution . in our case",
    "the charge density and the 4-velocity appearing in ( [ dual-8 ] ) are functions of @xmath85 , as determined by the fluid flow on the boundary .",
    "so there is a nonzero electric field component along the @xmath85 direction , given by f_0z = - v_z _ z v_z [ dual-14 ] where we have used ( [ q_infty ] ) to express @xmath199 in terms of the velocity @xmath10 .",
    "the expression for the bulk metric simplifies as well . in the fourth line of ( [ dual-7 ] ) , the first term is proportional to @xmath196 which vanishes for our flows . the second term is proportional to @xmath200 defined in ( [ dual-15 ] ) and vanishes as shown above .    in the derivative expansion ,",
    "the relationship between the boundary and the bulk becomes essentially local .",
    "the bulk solution can in fact be constructed approximately by patching together tube geometries obtained by extending the boundary data in a given region of the boundary to the bulk using the radial equations of motion .",
    "consequently we expect that the acoustic horizon of the fluid flow on the boundary extends trivially into the bulk .",
    "we will explicitly verify this in the next subsection .",
    "however , this tubewise approximation breaks down in regions where the local geometry is exactly extremal .",
    "this is apparent in the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent work on perturbations around extremal black holes shows that the relevant low energy expansion is different from the naive derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "our results hold close to extremality , but not exactly at extremality .      the gravity duals of phonons in the fluid are quasinormal modes of metric and gauge field perturbations .",
    "once again , construction of these modes is trivial .",
    "we need to write ( x^ ) = _ 0 ( x^ ) + ( x^ ) , compute @xmath201 and hence @xmath202 in terms of @xmath203 , substitute into ( [ dual-7 ] ) and ( [ dual-8 ] ) , and consider the terms which are linear in @xmath204 . by construction , these modes satisfy ingoing boundary conditions at the bulk horizon .",
    "the fluctuations of the gauge field @xmath205 obtained by this procedure have a particularly simple form a_= - [ ( _ _ 0)(^_0 ) ^_+ ( _ _ 0)(^_0 ) ] _ ( ) [ dual-16 ] for the background flows considered in section 2 , we have found solutions to the wave equation ( [ wave_eqn ] ) for @xmath206 in the region close to the acoustic horizon . upon inserting these solutions into ( [ dual-16 ] )",
    ", we see that the fluctuations @xmath207 have a characteristic behavior near the acoustic horizon , viz .",
    "ingoing waves are smooth while outgoing waves have rapid fluctuations .",
    "this is the precise sense in which the fluctuations perceive the acoustic horizon , which has now extended into the bulk . from the nature of the solution that the extension of the acoustic horizon into the bulk is",
    "rather trivial - i.e. the horizon perceived by these modes is at the same value of @xmath85 as the acoustic horizon on the boundary , and for all values of @xmath36 .",
    "the fluctuations for the components of the metric can be similarly worked out and also see a horizon structure at the same value of @xmath85 .",
    "we therefore conclude that there are certain quasinormal modes of the bulk metric and the gauge field which perceive a horizon .",
    "if these bulk modes are quantized , one should find a thermal bath of such modes characterized by the temperature of the acoustic horizon on the boundary .",
    "it is important to check that the fluid flow described above is consistent with the standard conditions for validity of hydrodynamics . roughly speaking ,",
    "hydrodynamics is valid when the gradients of velocities , temperature and charge densities are small compared to the inverse mean free path @xmath208 . for charged conformal fluids considered above",
    ", there are two scales - the temperature @xmath29 and the chemical potential @xmath209 , so that @xmath210 .",
    "the function @xmath211 is of order one for generic values of @xmath212 , but there is an upper bound on @xmath212 , @xmath213 where @xmath211 has a simple zero .",
    "it is possible to take the limit of @xmath214 simultaneously with @xmath215 such that @xmath208 is finite - the dual of this is in fact the extremal black hole . for the flow described in the previous section , in this limit",
    "we have | | & & +    @xmath16 is @xmath216 , this implies that t_h for observable acoustic hawking radiation , the hawking temperature should be higher than the fluid temperature .",
    "so we require tt_h [ tth ] furthermore , the frequency of the sound waves should also be small compared to the basic scale , @xmath217 .",
    "however , the finite hawking temperature is going to introduce an upper bound on the allowed wavelengths , due to periodicity in euclidean time ; thus @xmath218 .",
    "thus we need [ regime ] t t_h < for fluids with no conserved charge , there is only one energy scale , namely , the temperature @xmath29 ; thus @xmath219 and ( [ tth ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "although the solution is otherwise valid , the hawking radiation , at a temperature much lower than the ambient temperature , is not going to be observable . for fluids with a conserved charge the condition ( [ tth ] ) does not pose a problem because now we have two length scales , the temperature @xmath29 and the chemical potential @xmath23 . for fluids very close to zero temperature ,",
    "the mean free path will be governed only by @xmath23 .",
    "we can thus have 0 t t_h <    the ability to construct a gravity dual using a derivative expansion imposes further conditions . in the presence of a nonconstant @xmath4 , the validity of the derivative expansion of the solutions of the bulk equations of motion requires that the curvature invariants and all invariants constructed out of the derivatives of curvature be small .",
    "an example of such an invariant is @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the ricci scalar and we require for this example [ deriv_curv ] ( g^__)^.    we get additional conditions if some of the boundary directions are compactified as in the nozzle geometry of section ( [ ss : nozzle ] ) .",
    "if one boundary direction of a @xmath222 geometry is made compact with a radius @xmath4 , the dual is an @xmath1 soliton @xcite which caps off the geometry at a value of the radial coordinate @xmath223 . for a black brane geometry , compactification of a boundary direction would lead to a similar modification of the usual black brane geometry .",
    "however if @xmath224 , where @xmath33 is the location of the black brane horizon , the place where the bulk geometry would cap off is far inside the black brane horizon .",
    "in this situation we can continue to use the standard black brane geometry with a compact longitudinal direction .",
    "we will therefore require that for all @xmath85 , r(z ) 1/r_+ [ valid-2 ] for the solution of section ( [ ss : nozzle ] ) .",
    "finally we require for the nozzle solution that @xmath4 be finite for large @xmath85 .",
    "the geometry is then asymptotically @xmath225 and has an ads dual .",
    "finally , we determine the range of parameters for which our approximations are valid , for the specific flows studied in section 2 .",
    "let us first discuss the wormhole solution of equations ( [ r(z)_2wh ] ) and ( [ v_2wh ] ) .",
    "the solution has four parameters , @xmath88 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "@xmath89 is fixed by ( [ r(z)_min ] ) once @xmath228 is chosen .",

    "thus we require @xmath235 .",
    "@xmath226 can be chosen such that we are always at very low temperatures , following the discussion around equation ( [ lowtemp ] ) .",
    "to summarize , the conditions for our wormhole solution to be valid are : [ valid_2wh ] t0,<_,_.    for the nozzle solution described by ( [ explicit_profile ] ) , the parameters are @xmath227 , @xmath236 , @xmath111 , @xmath88 , @xmath226 and @xmath89 . as in the previous case ,",
