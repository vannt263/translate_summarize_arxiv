    "it was in fact the first non - trivial solution to the einstein field equations to be discovered @xcite .",
    "in kruskal ( null ) @xmath4 coordinates the maximally extended metric reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and the radius function @xmath8 is given implicitly by @xmath9        here the underlying manifold @xmath10 is endowed with the differential structure of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the open subset @xmath13 in the @xmath14 plane ; see figure [ krusk ] .",
    "the spacetime has an essential curvature singularity at @xmath15 , ( the future component of ) which is contained in the interior of the black hole region , the quadrant @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , a short computation shows that the gauss curvature of the @xmath14-plane equals @xmath17 and hence the manifold is @xmath18 inextendible past @xmath15 .",
    "an interesting feature of this singularity is its spacelike character , that is , it can be viewed as a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "yet another interesting feature of the schwarzschild singularity is its unstable nature from the evolutionary dynamical point of view . to illustrate this consider a global spacelike cauchy hypersurface @xmath19 in schwarzschild ( figure [ sigmaivp ] ) .",
    "an initial data set for the eve consists of a riemannian metric @xmath20 on @xmath21 and a symmetric two tensor @xmath22 verifying the constraint equations @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the covariant derivative and scalar curvature intrinsic to @xmath20 .",
    "the instability of the schwarzschild singularity ( w.r.t . the forward cauchy problem ) can already be seen by examining the maximal developments of initial data sets on @xmath21 arising from the celebrated kerr @xcite ( explicit ) 2-parameter @xmath25 family of solutions  of which schwarzschild is a subfamily ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "for @xmath27 the singularity completely disappears and the corresponding ( maximal ) developments extend smoothly up to ( and including ) the cauchy horizons ( which lie far beyond the hypersurface @xmath28 ) .",
    "moreover , taking @xmath29 , the ` difference ' of the corresponding initial data sets from the schwarzschild one ( with the same @xmath7 ) , measured in standard sobolev norms , sobolev spaces used in the literature @xcite .",
    "] can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "in fact , the schwarzschild singularity is conjecturally unstable under _ generic _ perturbations on @xmath21 . according to a scenario proposed by belinski@xmath30-khalatnikov - lifshitz @xcite originally formulated for cosmological singularities , in general",
    ", one should expect solutions to exhibit oscillatory behaviour towards the singularity.m @xcite for the euler - einstein system with bianchi ix symmetry .",
    "] although this work was not supported by much rigorous evidence , it has received a lot of attention over the years , see @xcite and the references therein ( and @xcite for related numerics ) . on the other hand , there is a growing expectation that , at least in a neighbourhood of subextremal kerr , the dominant scenario inside the black hole is the formation of cauchy horizons and ( weak ) null singularities .",
    "this has been supported by rigorous studies on spherically symmetric charged matter models , see works by poisson and israel @xcite , ori @xcite and recently by dafermos @xcite .",
    "however , it is not inferred from the existing literature whether the non - oscillatory type of singularity observed in scwarzschild is an isolated phenomenon for the eve in some neighbourhood of the schwarzschild initial data on @xmath21 or part of a larger family . a priori",
    "it is not clear what to expect , since one might argue that such a special singularity is a mathematical artefact due to spherical symmetry .",
    "therefore , we pose the following question :    _ is there a class of non - spherically symmetric einstein vacuum spacetimes which develop a first singularity of schwarzschild type ? _    the goal of the present paper is to answer the preceding question in the affirmative .",
    "a schwarzschild type singularity here has the meaning of a first singularity in the vacuum development which has the same geometric blow up profile with schwarzschild and which can be seen by a foliation of uniformly spacelike hypersurfaces ; hence , not contained in a cauchy horizon .",
    "we confine the question to the formation of one singular sphere in the vacuum development in the same manner as in schwarzschild , where each point on the sphere can be understood as a distinct ideal singular point of the spacetime in the language of tips @xcite .",
    "ideally one would like to study the forward problem and identify initial data for the eve on @xmath21 ( figure [ sigmaivp ] ) that lead to such singularities .",
    "although this is a very interesting problem , we find it far beyond reach at the moment .",
    "instead we study the existence problem backwards - in - time .",
    "more precisely , we adopt the following plan : let @xmath31 be a spacelike hypersurface in schwarzschild , tangent coordinates ( [ schw ] ) . ] at a single sphere of the singular hyperbola @xmath15 inside the black hole ; figure [ gens_fol ] .",
    "we assume , without loss of generality , hypersurfaces ( figure [ krusk ] ) is killing and we may hence utilize it to shift @xmath0 and @xmath32 to whichever point on @xmath33 we wish ; figure ( [ gens_fol ] ) . ] that the tangent sphere is @xmath34 ) in kruskal coordinates ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "consider now initial data sets @xmath35 on @xmath0 for the eve ( [ eve ] ) , which have the same singular behaviour to leading order at @xmath32 with the induced schwarzschild initial data set @xmath36 on @xmath0 and solve the eve backwards , as depicted in the 2-dim figure [ gens_fol ] , without symmetry assumptions .    realizing the above plan we thus prove the existence of a class of non - spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes for which @xmath37 the leading asymptotics of the blow up of curvature and in general of all the geometric quantities ( metric , second fundamental form etc . ) coincide with their schwarzschild counterparts , as one approaches the singularity , and @xmath38 the singularity is realized as the limit of uniformly spacelike hypersurfaces , which in the forward direction  pinch off \" in finite time at one sphere .",
    "conversely , we visualise the backward evolution of @xmath39 in the following manner : at ` time ' @xmath40 the initial slice @xmath0 is a two ended spacelike ( 3-dim ) hypersurface with a sphere singularity at @xmath32 .",
    "once @xmath0 evolves through ( [ eve ] ) , it becomes instantaneously a smooth spacelike hypersurface @xmath41 and the singular _ pinch _ opens up ; figure [ s_fol3d ] .",
    "the main difficulty to overcome in the backward local existence problem is the essential singularity on @xmath0 , which of course renders it beyond the scope of the classical local existence theorem for the einstein equations @xcite , even its latest state of the art improvement by klainerman - rodnianski - szeftel @xcite , which requires at the very least the curvature of the initial hypersurface to be in @xmath42 . for the schwarzschild initial data set @xmath43 on @xmath0 , and",
    "hence for perturbed initial data sets @xmath35 with the same leading order geometry at @xmath32 , it is not hard to check (  [ schwarz ] ) that the initial curvature is at the singular level @xmath44 to our knowledge , the only general local existence results , without symmetry assumptions , for the eve ( [ eve ] ) with singular initial curvature not in @xmath42 have been achieved only fairly recently by luk - rodnianski @xcite and luk @xcite for the characteristic initial value problem .",
    "however , the singular level of the schwarzschild singularity is much stronger than the ones they consider ; delta curvature singularities @xcite and weak null singularities @xcite .",
    "also , since we are interested in the spacelike character of the singularity of the perturbed spacetimes we wish to construct , the non - characteristic initial value problem seems to be a more natural setting to consider .",
    "we proceed now to formulate a first version of our main results ; for more precise statements , in terms of weighted sobolev spaces , see theorems [ mainthm ] , [ mainthm2 ] , [ conststab ] .",
    "[ thma ] there exists @xmath45 sufficiently large , such that for every triplet @xmath39 verifying : + @xmath46 the constraints ( [ const ] ) , + @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are 2-tensors on @xmath0 bounded in @xmath51 respectively , + @xmath52 @xmath53 , + there exists a @xmath54 local solution @xmath55 to the einstein vacuum equations ( [ eve ] ) with initial data @xmath35 , unique up to isometry , in the backward region to @xmath0 , foliated by @xmath56}$ ] ( figure [ gens_fol ] ) ; the time of existence @xmath57 depends continuously on the norms of @xmath50 and the exponent @xmath45 .",
    "the fact that non - trivial initial data sets in compliance with theorem [ thma ] exist is not at all obvious nor standard .",
    "it has to be shown essentially that for any large parameter @xmath45 , the set of non - spherically symmetric solutions to the constraint equations ( [ const ] ) , having the asymptotics @xmath47 , is non - empty .",
    "this is achieved in the following theorem .",
    "[ thmb ] let @xmath45 be sufficiently large , consistent with theorem [ thma ] .",
    "there exists a small ball @xmath58 , such that for every pair @xmath59 of 2-tensors defined on the boundary of @xmath0 , which lie inside that ball , there exists at least one extension of @xmath59 as 2-tensors in @xmath0 satisfying the assumptions of theorem [ thma ] .",
    "in particular , the pair @xmath35 defined via @xmath47 in theorem [ thma ] satisfies the constraints ( [ const ] ) .",
    "finally , let us emphasize the fact that the above spacetimes are very special in that they agree with schwarzschild at the singularity to a high ( but finite ) order  this is captured by the large exponent @xmath45 in theorem [ thma ]  and therefore are _ non - generic_. the need to choose @xmath60 large may be seen however natural to some extend in view of the instability of the schwarzschild singularity ; from the point of view of the forwards - in - time problem . indeed , the stable perturbations of the schwarzschild singularity must form a strict subclass of all perturbed vacuum developments .",
    "the largest part of the paper is concerned with the evolutionary part of the problem , i.e. , proving theorem [ thma ] . due to the singular nature of backward existence problem described above , figure [ gens_fol ] ,",
    "the choice of framework must be carefully considered .",
    "the standard wave coordinates approach @xcite does not seem to be feasible in our situation ; one expects that coordinates would be highly degenerate at the singularity .",
    "also , the widely used cmc gauge condition is not applicable , since the mean curvature of the initial hypersurface @xmath0 blows up (  [ schwarz ] ) .",
    "instead , we find it more suitable to use orthonormal frames and rewrite the eve one order higher as a quasilinear yang - mills hyperbolic system of equations @xcite , under a lorentz gauge condition , for the corresponding connection 1-forms .",
    "we recall briefly this framework in  [ dee ] .",
    "however , even after expressing the eve in the above framework , the singular level of initial configurations do not permit a direct energy estimate approach .",
    "in addition to ( [ rnotinl2 ] ) , one can see (  [ schwarz ] ) that neither is the second fundamental form in @xmath42 @xmath61 note that the latter is at the level of one derivative in the metric .",
    "hence , near the singularity the perturbed spacetimes we wish to construct do not even make sense as weak solutions of the eve ( [ eve ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is crucial that we use the background schwarzschild spacetime to recast the evolution equations in a new form having more regular initial data .",
    "we do this in  [ stab ] by considering a new system of equations for the ` difference ' between the putative perturbed spacetime and schwarzschild .",
    "the resulting equations have now regular initial data and they are eligible for an energy method , but there is a price to pay .",
    "the coefficients of the new system will depend on the schwarzschild geometry and will necessarily be highly singular at @xmath15 .",
    "we compute in  [ schwarz ] the precise blow up orders of the schwarzschild connection coefficients , curvature etc .",
    "nevertheless , the issue of evolving singular initial data has become the more tractable problem of finding appropriate weighted solution spaces for the final singular equations .",
    "in  [ whs ] we introduce the weighted sobolev spaces which yield the desired flexibility in proving energy estimates .",
    "the right weights are given naturally by the singularities in the coefficients of the resulting equations , namely , powers of the schwarzschild radius function @xmath8 with a certain analogy corresponding to the order of each term .",
    "after stating the general local existence theorems in  [ main ] and a more precise version of theorem [ thma ] , we proceed to its proof via a contraction mapping argument which occupies section [ fixedpt ] .",
    "therein we derive the main weighted energy estimates by exploiting the asymptotic analysis at @xmath15 of the schwarzschild components (  [ schwarz ] ) .",
    "it is necessary in our result that the power of @xmath8 , @xmath45 , in the weighted norms is sufficiently large ; cf .",
    "assumption @xmath47 in theorem [ thma ] . in the estimating process certain _ critical _ terms",
    "are inevitably generated , because of the singularities in the coefficients of the system we are working with ; these terms are critical in that they appear with larger weights than the ones in the energy we are trying to control and thus prevent the estimates from closing .",
    "the exponent @xmath45 is then picked sufficiently large such that these critical terms have an overall favourable sign ; this allows us to drop the critical terms and close the estimates .",
    "the largeness of @xmath60 forces the perturbed spacetime to agree asymptotically with schwarzschild to a high order at the singularity .",
    "although the latter may seem restrictive , it is quite surprising to us that there even exists a suitable choice of @xmath60 which makes the argument work in the first place .",
    "a closer inspection of our method reveals that it is very sensitive with respect to certain asymptotics of the coefficients in the equations that happen to be just borderline to allow an energy - based argument to close .",
    "the most important of these are the blow up order of the sectional curvature ( [ k ] ) and the rate of growth of the schwarzschild radius function @xmath8 backwards in time .",
    "the latter corresponds to the ` opening up ' rate of the _ neck pinch _ of the singular initial hypersurface @xmath0 , figure [ s_fol3d ] . in this sense",
    "the schwarzschild singularity is exactly at the threshold that our energy - based method can tolerate .    in the last section ,  [ singconst ] ,",
    "we study the constraint equations ( [ const ] ) in a perturbative manner about the schwarzschild singular initial data set @xmath43 on @xmath0 .",
    "first we prescribe boundary data consists of two components diffeomorphic to @xmath62 .",
    "] at @xmath63 close to schwarzschild ( in usual sobolev norms , see theorem [ thmb ] ) and then look for solutions @xmath35 to constraints inside the class of singular initial data sets that are compatible with our assumptions on the evolutionary problem ; cf .",
    "theorem [ thma ] .",
    "it is very likely that the _ generic _ behaviour at @xmath32 of solutions to ( [ const ] ) with this perturbed data at the boundary of @xmath0 will not agree with schwarzschild to a high enough order for theorem [ thma ] to be applicable .",
    "however , we prove the existence of solutions for which the asymptotic behaviour required by theorem [ thma ] indeed holds .",
    "we obtain theorem [ thmb ] as an application of the implicit function theorem .",
    "the proof is based on properties of the constraint map @xcite , defined in the weighted sobolev spaces introduced above . in order to prove the surjectivity of the linearized constraint map around schwarzschild , we use an indirect argument from @xcite adapted to our context .",
    "one of the main ingredients in the proof involves the fredholm property of a linearized operator , see proposition [ fred ] , which we prove in  [ conffred ] by deriving certain weighted elliptic estimates .      to our surprise",
    "the present evolution bears some resemblance at an analytical level with a prior work on the stability of singular ricci solitons @xcite .",
    "although of different nature , hyperbolic / parabolic ( respectively ) , they share a couple of key features such as the opening up rate of the singularity and the `` borderline '' singularities in the coefficients involved .",
    "the understanding of the question of stability of singularities in einstein s equations and the behaviour of solutions near them is of great significance in the field .",
    "however , in general very little is known . in terms of rigorous results ,",
    "substantial progress has been made under symmetry assumptions in the presence of matter @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "moreover , certain matter models enjoy the presence of a monotonic quantity , which has been employed to study the stability of singularity formation in the general non - symmetric regime , cf .",
    "recent work of rodnianski - speck @xcite on the flrw big bang singularity .",
    "this is in contrast with the vacuum case and the unstable nature of the schwarzschild singularity .",
    "we emphasize again the fact that the method developed herein does not impose any symmetry assumptions nor it relies on any monotonicity .",
    "it should be noted as well that it does not depend on whether the particular singularity type is _ generic _ or not . on the contrary",
    ", we hope that it can serve as a robust new method which can be generally employed to produce classes of examples of non - symmetric singular solutions to the einstein field equations , which until now are only known to exist under special symmetry assumptions and for which the general stability question may be out of reach .",
    "after our treatment of singular initial data containing a single sphere of @xmath33 , a reasonable next step would be to study whether the construction of non - spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes containing an arc of the singular hyperbola ( figure [ gens_fol ] ) is possible or even the whole singularity @xmath15 .",
    "certainly this is a more restrictive question and at first glance not so obvious how to formulate it as a backward initial value problem problem for the eve .",
    "however , we hope that the method developed herein could help approach this direction .",
    "lastly , one could try to perform a global instead of a local construction by considering a cauchy hypersurface @xmath0 extending to spacelike infinity .",
    "we expect this follows readily from the work here , but we do not pursue it further . perhaps a gluing construction could also be achieved .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor spyros alexakis for his valuable suggestions and interest in this work .",
    "i am grateful to mihalis dafermos for helpful comments on a preliminary version of the present paper .",

    "the einstein vacuum equations ( [ eve ] ) , by virtue of the second bianchi identity , imply the vanishing of the divergence of the riemann curvature tensor . decomposing the latter with respect to an orthonormal frame , which satisfies a suitable gauge condition",
    ", it results to a quasilinear second order hyperbolic system of equations for the connection 1-forms corresponding to that frame , which bears resemblance to the semilinear yang - mills @xcite .",
    "recently this formulation of the eve played a key role in the resolution of the bounded @xmath42 curvature conjecture @xcite . in this section",
    "we express the eve ( [ eve ] ) in the above setting , which we are going to use to directly solve the cauchy problem .",
    "this necessitates some technical details which are carried out in appendix [ app1 ] . also , to avoid additional computations",
    "we write all equations directly in scalar non - tensorial form .",
