    "@xmath45 that characterize the @xmath34 uniquely as described in section [ sec : prelims ] , we define the function    @xmath46    we remark that for each @xmath47 in the domain of @xmath48 , the image is comprised of two different ciphertexts , i.e. , it does not collapse to a singleton set . indeed , this is the case due to the choice of the plaintexts @xmath49 as the condition @xmath50 implies that @xmath51 .",
    "we next describe our core result , namely a reduction from the problem of finding the secret key @xmath34 to an instance of simon s problem which can then be solved efficiently on a quantum computer .",

    "then , to store an element @xmath56 in the image of @xmath48 , we simply store the ordered pair @xmath57 as its unique @xmath58-bit representation .",
    "next , consider two different @xmath0-bit strings @xmath59 that satisfy @xmath60 :    * if @xmath61 then the choice of the plaintexts @xmath49 implies @xmath62 , so this can not happen . * if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 , which by the choice of the plaintexts @xmath65 means that @xmath66 .",
    "so we have the implication @xmath67 the converse follows trivially from @xmath68 .    next ,",
    "let us check that the function @xmath69 can be evaluated efficiently .",

    "this means we can obtain the pair @xmath72 in polynomial time , and we are left to distill our unique @xmath58-bit representation of the _ set _ comprised by these two elements .",
    "as indicated in the previous paragraph , such a representation can be implemented by interpreting the two ciphertexts as integers and by then sorting them . a quantum circuit to determine this unique representation of a pair of bitvectors consists of swapping @xmath70 and @xmath71 conditioned on the the latter value being smaller than the former . for instance with a reversible circuit to perform addition",
    "@xcite one can compute the difference of the binary numbers represented by @xmath70 and @xmath71 in polynomial time .",

    "the source register consists of the upper @xmath1 qubits , the target register of the lower @xmath1 qubits , and the control qubit sits in the middle . ]    in figure [ fig : rkcircuit ] we display the resulting quantum circuit .",
    "note that each computation of an intermediate result has to be uncomputed or else interference between the various computational paths could not take place .",
    "the overall structure of the circuit is that of a fourier sampling circuit , i.e. , a circuit type that arises in the solution of abelian hidden subgroup problems @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the hiding function @xmath48 is decomposed into several subroutines to make the circuit more readable : in a first stage , the classical @xmath0-bit vector @xmath47 is fanned out into two copies using a cnot gate ( note that a line with a tick denotes a quantum register holding two or more qubits ) .",
    "the value @xmath47 is then passed to a subroutine computing @xmath77 , respectively @xmath78 in superposition .",
    "these subroutines are carried out by circuits as in figure [ fig : oracle ] .",
    "an efficient cirucit for @xmath77 can be synthesized by making the efficient circuit ( which by assumption exists ) reversible . for the implementation of @xmath78 we make use of the related - key oracle @xmath79 . throughout",
    ", it should be noted that @xmath73 is a vector that uniquely characterizes @xmath34 as in section [ sec : attackmodel ] .",
    "the `` comp '' operation is shown in figure [ fig : comp ] and can be realized similarly to addition of integers .",
    "see also @xcite for implementations of comparison circuits that optimize circuit width , respectively circuit depth .",
    "the result of the comparison is then used to copy the smaller of the two registers ( when interpreted as integers ) into the uppermost of the last two registers and the larger one into the lower one .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : copy ] one of the operations is shown that allow to select one of the two registers holding an @xmath80-bit integer , depending on the value of the comparison operation .",
    "the other type which picks a register controlled by the negated value of the comparison bit is implemented analogously .",
    "overall we have established the following result .",
    "[ the : prop ] for every @xmath44 the function  @xmath48 defined above satisfies the conditions needed to apply theorem  [ the : simon ] , and the bound @xmath81 can be chosen to be polynomial .    by combining theorems [ the : simon ] and [ the : prop ]",
    "we now obtain the following quantum related - key attack which runs in expected polynomial time :    1 .   check if the secret target key @xmath34 is the all - zero key @xmath82 by computing @xmath83 and comparing these ciphertexts with the given ciphertexts @xmath84 .",
