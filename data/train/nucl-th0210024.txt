    "one of the first measurements at rhic was the elliptic anisotropy of the particles produced  @xcite .",
    "it was found to be as large as the hydrodynamical prediction  @xcite and subsequent hydrodynamical calculations achieved good fits to its centrality and @xmath1 dependence  @xcite . in the following i review how well hydrodynamical models can fit the data published after those early papers and what constraints the data has set on the initial state of hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "as an example of hydrodynamical results , i mostly quote the work of kolb and heinz  @xcite .",
    "this is not meant to imply that other calculations are of lesser importance , but rather to emphasize how much of the data can be explained using one set of parameters .",
    "the conventional method to initialize hydrodynamical calculations is to fix the initial densities ( energy or entropy and net baryon density ) to reproduce the observed particle abundancies and to choose freeze - out temperature to reproduce the observed slopes of the spectra .",
    "this approach was also applied in  @xcite where the initial state was fixed to reproduce the charged particle multiplicity as a function of centrality and the freeze - out temperature was chosen to fit the central collision data .",
    "therefore the good fit to pion and antiproton spectra in the most central collisions shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ pts ] is not surprising . on the other hand , the slope of the spectra as a function of centrality are predictions and , as can be seen , the agreement with data is impressive . for antiprotons",
    "the prediction lies within the experimental errors up to @xmath2 gev/@xmath3 . only for very peripheral collisions , @xmath4 fm ,",
    "do the data show a significant excess of particles at @xmath5 gev/@xmath3 . in hydrodynamical description",
    "the observed excess of antiprotons over pions at @xmath6 gev/@xmath3 is simply a consequence of strong transverse flow .    in this calculation local chemical equilibrium",
    "is assumed to hold until kinetic freeze - out . since the favoured kinetic freeze - out temperature , @xmath7 mev , is much smaller that the chemical freeze - out temperature , @xmath8175 mev given by thermal models  @xcite , it is not possible to obtain correct proton and antiproton yields simultaneously . in  @xcite",
    "this was circumvented by using pion yields at @xmath9 mev as they were , but scaling by hand all the other particle yields to their calculated values at hadronization temperature @xmath10 mev .",
    "the results obtained in this way are very similar to those of  @xcite where the hadronic phase is described by a transport model and separate chemical and kinetic freeze - outs are included .",
    "thus one can consider the results of  @xcite to be reasonable approximations .",
    "since the initial particle production is azimuthally symmetric , azimuthal anisotropy of the final particle distributions is a signal of rescatterings among the particles produced .",
    "more frequent rescattering can be expected to lead to a larger anisotropy , and since hydrodynamics assumes zero mean free path and thus an infinite scattering rate , it provides an upper limit to observable anisotropies .",
    "anisotropy is quantified by measuring the harmonic coefficients @xmath11 of a fourier expansion in @xmath12 of the measured hadron spectrum @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "anisotropy characterized by a non - zero second coefficient , @xmath14 , is called elliptic anisotropy or elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 as a function of transverse momentum @xmath1 in minimum bias collisions is shown in fig .  [ v2pt ] .",
    "the calculation was done using an equation of state with a first order phase transition ( eos q ) and without a phase transition ( eos h ) .",
    "the observed anisotropy of charged hadrons shown in the left panel is seen to reach the hydrodynamical values up to @xmath15 gev . above @xmath16",
    "gev the hydrodynamical result keeps increasing monotonically whereas the data saturates , indicating incomplete thermalization of the high momentum particles .",
    "the pion and proton anisotropies depicted in the right panel also show the hydrodynamically predicted mass dependence : at low values of transverse momentum , the heavier the particle , the smaller its @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "interestingly at this conference the pion anisotropy was shown to deviate from hydrodynamical predictions around @xmath172 gev , whereas the proton anisotropy reaches hydrodynamical values even at @xmath18 gev  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen the anisotropy of hadrons or pions is quite insensitive to the phase transition , but the anisotropy of protons shows a clear dependence : the curve calculated assuming a phase transition is very close to the data , but an eos without a phase transition leads to too large a proton anisotropy at low @xmath1 .",
    "the fit to the proton data shown in fig .",
    "[ v2pt ] is worse than achieved in earlier calculations  @xcite .",
    "this is due to a different freeze - out temperature , which was @xmath19 mev in  @xcite , but was chosen to be @xmath9 mev in  @xcite to achieve a better fit to the @xmath1 spectra .",
    "on the other hand , the hydro + cascade approach of  @xcite reproduces well both the @xmath1 spectra and differential anisotropy @xmath20 of pions and protons without such ambiguity . whether this points to a weakness in the ordinary cooper - frye description of freeze - out or",
    "is a result of differences in the initialization of the calculations remains to be seen .    in fig .",
    "[ v2b ] the centrality dependence of the anisotropy coefficient @xmath14 is shown .",
    "the calculation is similar to that in  @xcite and the data is analysed by the star collaboration  @xcite using the 4th order cumulant method  @xcite .",
    "the fit to the data is slightly worse than shown before  @xcite since the 4th order method leads to smaller values of @xmath14 than previously published  @xcite .",
    "the new values are , however , within the systematic errors of the older analysis .",
    "the present data is below the hydrodynamical limit in all but the most central collisions , but the discrepancy is significant only for large impact parameters , @xmath21 fm .    in the calculations mentioned so far",
    "the expansion is assumed to be boost invariant .",
    "if the assumption of boost invariance is relaxed and expansion in all three dimensions is done numerically , the centrality and @xmath1 dependence of the anisotropy at midrapidity is similar to that in the boost invariant case  @xcite . when compared to the excellent fit to data shown in fig .",
    "[ v2pt ] , the pseudorapidity dependence of elliptic anisotropy shown in fig .",
    "[ v2eta ] @xcite looks less satisfactory .",
    "the data reaches the hydrodynamical value only around midrapidity . on the other hand",
    ", even this result reproduces the data within a window of one to two units of pseudorapidity .",
    "this region already contains most of the particles produced .",
    "it is worth remembering that anisotropy in hydrodynamical models depends strongly on the initial shape of the system .",
    "the initialization used in  @xcite is relatively simple and a more sophisticated initialization may lead to better fit to the data .",
    "therefore it is premature to conclude , based on this data and calculation alone , that thermalization is reached only at midrapidity .",
    "the analysis of two - particle momentum correlations known as hbt interferometry provides a method to study the space - time structure of the emitting source  @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that a first order phase transition would lead to unusually large hbt radii  @xcite .",
    "however , comparisons of calculations  @xcite with data  @xcite have lead to the so - called _ hbt - puzzle _ : all calculations give a ratio of hbt radii @xmath22 larger than one , but the experimental value is of order one .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ hbt - kuva ] @xcite , hydrodynamics usually leads to a too small sideward radius @xmath23 and to a too large outward radius @xmath24 .",
    "this is usually interpreted to mean that the system expands more and its lifetime is shorter than given by hydrodynamics .",
    "so far it looks like it is possible to fit either @xmath25 or @xmath26 , but not both simultaneously .",
    "a good fit to @xmath23 was achieved in  @xcite where the hadronic phase was described using a hadronic cascade .",
    "this naturally leads to a spatial freeze - out distribution with a larger average size in the sideward direction and thus to larger @xmath23 .",
    "an acceptable fit was achieved also in  @xcite where the initial size of the system was larger than in other calculations , but the outward radius @xmath24 is too large in both of these works . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that if freeze - out takes place immediately after hadronization , @xmath27 mev , @xmath24 is reproduced , but @xmath23 is even smaller than when the freeze - out temperature is @xmath9 mev .",
    "the effect of such a high freeze - out temparture on single particle spectra or anisotropies was not checked either .",
    "one interesting detail shown in fig .",
    "[ hbt - kuva ] is that the radii are closest to the data when an equation of state with a smooth crossover is used .",
    "one can thus claim that hbt radii favour an equation of state with crossover but , as argued above , proton @xmath14 results favour an equation of state with a first order phase transition .",
    "the explanation to this seemingly contradictory behaviour , as well as to the entire hbt - puzzle , is still unknown at present . for the most recent developments",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that even if the hydrodynamical evolution is constrained to reproduce the observed single particle spectra , there still is considerable freedom in choosing the initial state .",
    "one degree of freedom which complicates the comparison of the initial state of different hydrodynamical calculations is the initial time , @xmath28 , of the calculation .",
    "its effect is easily seen in the bjorken estimate  @xcite for the initial energy density , @xmath29 where a smaller initial time leads to a larger initial energy density and vice versa .",
    "thus a meaningful comparison of initial states from different calculations requires scaling the initial densities to the same initial time @xmath30 .",
    "this is usually done by assuming one dimensional bjorken expansion with an ideal gas equation of state from the initial time @xmath28 of a particular calculation to a chosen common time @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "however , even if the difference in initial time is taken into account , the final single particle spectra allow very different initial energy distributions . as an example of this , initial energy distributions used in recent calculations by morita _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and eskola _ et al . _",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ initials ] .",
    "the former is a simple generalization of the one dimensional bjorken model to transversely expanding central collisions : a flat energy density distribution with gaussian smearing near the edges .",
    "the latter is based on a pqcd saturation calculation  @xcite of the transverse energy of minijets produced in the primary collisions which leads to a very peaked distribution of energy density . in this approach the net baryon density is also obtained from pqcd calculation and  after fixing the equation of state and equating the initial time with the formation time , @xmath32  the only free parameter is the freeze - out temperature  @xcite .    even though the initial states in these two calculations are very different , the final single particle distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ pt - comp ] are surprisingly similar and reproduce the slopes equally well !",
    "the particle yields must again be treated with caution . in both of these works",
    "chemical equilibrium is assumed to hold until kinetic freeze - out . in",
    "@xcite the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath33 mev is well below the chemical freeze - out temperatures given by thermal models .",
    "thus the authors note that their calculation reproduces the observed slopes of the spectra , but to reach the yields , they must scale them by hand . on the other hand , the authors of  @xcite employ a considerably high freeze - out temperature , @xmath34 mev , which allows them to reproduce also the particle abundancies .",
    "unfortunately other observables are not helpful in differentiating these two approaches either .",
    "both of the calculations were done for central collisions where the elliptic anisotropy is zero .",
    "the hbt radii are sensitive to the build - up of flow and the lifetime of the system and therefore to the initial distributions , but unfortunately hbt radii were not calculated in  @xcite . as an estimate one can use the hbt radii for a high freeze - out temperature shown in  @xcite instead .",
    "the radii in  @xcite and  @xcite are indeed different , but neither of them reproduces the data : the first leads to a correct @xmath24 but too small a @xmath23 , whereas the latter reproduces @xmath23 acceptably but @xmath24 is too large .",
    "another observable which is sensitive to the maximum temperature reached in heavy ion collisions is the spectrum of direct photons , but there is no photon data available yet , nor was the yield calculated in these papers .",
    "even if the initial energy density distribution is only weakly constrained by the data , the initial energy per unit rapidity is almost fixed . in table",
    "[ taulukko ] the initial states of recent hydrodynamical calculations are characterized by scaling to @xmath35 fm/@xmath3 and calculating the average energy density in the transverse plane .",
    "the peak values of the initial energy density have a huge spread from 6 to 160 gev/@xmath36 in these works , but the average values at 1 fm/@xmath3 have a much smaller spread from 3.9 to 6.5 gev/@xmath36 .",
    "this spread is partially due to the different values of the effective transverse area , @xmath37 . if this is taken into account , the average energy density in all works is 56 gev/@xmath36 , very similar to the the bjorken estimate 4.6 gev/@xmath36  @xcite .",
    ".average initial energy density in the transverse plane scaled to a time @xmath35 fm/@xmath3 , initial time , and freeze - out temperature in recent hydrodynamical calculations . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the initial times of hydrodynamic evolution employed in these calculations have a relatively large spread from 0.2 to 1 fm/@xmath3 . however , in all calculations the initial time is shorter than the perturbatively estimated thermalization time of a few fm/@xmath3  @xcite . the basic argument in favour of a short initial time",
    "is based on elliptic anisotropy ; the estimate by kolb _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that if there is 1 or 2 fm/@xmath3 delay in thermalization , the value of @xmath14 decreases by 10% or 25 % , respectively , which leads to values of @xmath14 which are below the data .",
    "there is no similar consensus about the freeze - out temperature at rhic .",
    "the single particle spectra in central collisions can be fitted equally well ( fig .",
    "[ pt - comp ] ) if freeze - out takes place almost immediately after hadronization at @xmath38160 mev  @xcite or at @xmath33 mev  @xcite , roughly at the same temperature as at the sps .",
    "the elliptic anisotropy of protons provides an additional constraint on the freeze - out temperature .",
    "so far it seems to favour a relatively low freeze - out temperature of @xmath39 mev , but whether it is possible to fit the elliptic anisotropy data using same kind of initial state and freeze - out temperature as in  @xcite remains to be seen . while discussing freeze - out temperature at rhic it is also worth remembering that in the hybrid model of  @xcite , where the plasma phase is described using hydrodynamics and the hadron phase using hadronic cascade ( rqmd ) , freeze - out temperature is not well defined .",
    "hydrodynamical models have been very successful in explaining the single particle rhic data at low @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 spectra and anisotropies in central and semicentral collisions are well reproduced for @xmath40  2 gev , and the @xmath41 ratio at @xmath42 gev/@xmath3 has a simple explanation due to flow .",
    "especially impressive has been how hydrodynamics is able to create simultaneously an elliptic anisotropy of negative hadrons which is large enough and an anisotropy of protons which is small enough to fit the data .",
    "if one considers solely this data the collision system behaves like a thermal system .",
    "however , the reproduction of the hbt radii has been unsuccessful so far .",
    "it is unclear whether one should refine the final freeze - out process , the hadronization process , or the initial state to reach an acceptable description of the data .",
    "especially puzzling is the fact that the hbt radii seem to favour a relatively stiff equation of state with a crossover phase transition , whereas the elliptic anisotropy of protons favours a soft equation of state with a first order phase transition .",
    "the details of the initial state required to fit the data are not yet completely fixed .",
    "the common features of all calculations are that the collision system thermalizes rapidly  initial time is @xmath43 fm/@xmath3  and that the average initial energy density is well above the critical energy density .",
