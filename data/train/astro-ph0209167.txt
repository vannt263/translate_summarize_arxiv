    "understanding the nature of the large - scale structure and the evolutionary history of the universe is the central aim of cosmology .",
    "therefore , quantifying the observed distribution of matter rigorously is of fundamental importance , and @xmath2-point correlation functions have been the most widely used statistical tools for this purpose ( e.g. , see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "the inflationary scenario predicts gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the statistical properties of the gaussian field are fully characterized by the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) or its fourier transform , the power spectrum .",
    "based on this idea , the two - point statistical measures for various cosmological fields have been extensively used for testing the paradigm as well as constraining cosmological parameters ; the galaxy distribution in the redshift catalog ( e.g. , totsuji & kihara 1969 ; hamilton & tegmark 2002 ) , the cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( e.g. , de bernardis 2000 ) and the cosmic shear field ( e.g. , van waerbeke et al .",
    "however , even for gaussian initial conditions , nonlinear gravitational instability induces non - gaussian signatures in the mass distribution , which contain information on the nature of gravity and the dark matter . the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , or equivalently , its fourier - transformed counterpart , the bispectrum , is the lowest order statistical tool to probe the non - gaussianity .",
    "the 3pcf can place strong constraints on models of structure formation . as an example",
    ", the measurements of the bispectrum in the galaxy distribution at the large scales ( @xmath3 ) have been used to determine the bias parameter as well as to constrain the primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. , feldmann et al .",
    "2001 ; verde et al .",
    "it is also expected that the 3pcf of the cosmic shear field can be used to precisely determine the cosmological parameters complementary to the measurements of the 2pcf ( e.g. , bernardeau , mellier & van waerbeke 2002 ; bernardeau , van waerbeke , & mellier 2003 ) .    in this paper , we focus on developing a theoretical model of the 3pcf in real space for 3d and 2d cosmological fields . in practice , on small scales",
    "the 3pcf would be easier to measure from observational data over the bispectrum , since it does not require the fourier transform for the survey data that usually have a complicated geometry of data fields .",
    "theoretical models of the weakly nonlinear 3pcf have been well studied in the literature based on perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "perturbation theory can describe properties of the dark matter and galaxy clustering on large scales @xmath3 and predict that the 3pcf depends on the shape of triangle configuration and , as a result , contains information of the primordial power spectrum and the galaxy biasing .",
    "historically , the pioneering measurement of the galaxy 3pcf done by peebles & groth ( 1975 ) ( also groth & peebles 1977 ) proposed the `` hierarchical form '' , @xmath4 , $ ] with the constant @xmath5 .",
    "however , subsequent work has revealed that the measured 3pcf does not obey the hierarchical form rigorously and the large - scale amplitudes can be explained by the perturbation theory results of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , if the biasing relation is correctly taken into account for the analysis @xcite .    on the other hand , a quantitative theoretical model of the 3pcf in the strongly nonlinear regime is still lacking except for studies relying on @xmath6-body simulations ( matsubara & suto 1994 ; suto & matsubara 1994 ; jing & brner 1998 ) .",
    "simulations provide only limited physical insight into the complex non - linear phenomena involved in gravitational clustering , and are intractable for performing multiple evaluations in parameter space .    therefore , the main purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical model for predicting the 3pcf applicable to both the linear and nonlinear regimes . for this purpose , we need a model to correctly describe the redshift evolution and statistical properties of gravitational clustering up to the three - point level .",
    "we employ the so - called dark matter halo model , where gravitational clustering is described in terms of correlations between and within dark matter halos .",
    "originally , this model was developed to express nonlinear clustering as the real - space convolution of halo density profiles ( neymann & scott 1952 ; peebles 1974 ; mcclelland & silk 1977 ; and also see scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ; sheth & jain 1997 ; yano & gouda 1999 ; ma & fry 2000b , c ) .",
    "most recent works have relied on the the fourier - space formulation , since the forms of the power spectrum and the bispectrum become much simpler ( seljak 2000 ; ma & fry 2000c ; peacock & smith 2000 ; scoccimarro et al . 2001 ; cooray & hu 2001a , b ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; hamana , yoshida & suto 2002 ; takada & jain 2002 hereafter tj02 ; scranton 2002 ; and also cooray & sheth 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "the halo model appears remarkably successful in that , even though it relies on rather simplified assumptions , it has reproduced results from numerical simulations ( seljak 2000 ; ma & fry 2000c ; scoccimarro et al .",
    "2001 ; tj02 ) and also allowed for interpretations of observational results of galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "we formulate the 3pcf model so that it can be applied to general 3d and 2d cosmological fields , such as the mass and galaxy distributions and the cosmic shear fields .",
    "our method is built on the real - space formulation for the correlations of three particles in one halo .",
    "this is because the real - space approach enables us to compute the one - halo contribution to the 3pcf by a 4-dimensional integration , which is an advantage compared to the fourier space approach . for the 2- and 3-halo terms , we rely on the fourier - space approach and the approximations presented in scoccimarro et al .",
    "( 2001 ; also see tj02 ) .",
    "we study the transition from the quasi - linear to nonlinear regimes and the relative contribution of the different terms to the 3pcf .",
    "we show the halo model predictions for the 3pcf of the mass and galaxy distribution and the weak lensing convergence field for the currently favored cdm model . to do this ,",
    "we will focus on the dependences of the 3pcf on the triangle configurations as well as on the properties of the halo profile , its inner slope and concentration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ halo ] we present the formalism to compute the 3pcf of the 3d density field based on the real - space halo model and review the fourier - space halo approach and halo model ingredients ( halo density profile , mass function and bias model ) we will use in this paper . in  [ ang3pt ] , we present the method to compute the angular 3pcf . in  [ results ]",
    "we show the results of the halo model predictions for the 3pcf of the mass and galaxy distributions and the weak lensing convergence field .",
    "finally ,  [ discuss ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "we give some useful approximations for calculating the 3pcf in appendix [ app3pt ] and [ app ] .",
    "we use the currently favored cdm model ( @xmath7cdm ) with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the present - day density parameters of matter and cosmological constant , @xmath14 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath15 is the rms mass fluctuation in a sphere of @xmath16mpc radius .",
    "the choice of @xmath15 for this model is motivated by the cluster abundance analysis @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the real - space dark matter halo approach ( mcclelland & silk 1977 ; scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ; sheth & jain 1997 ; yano & gouda 1999 ; ma & fry 2000b , c ) , where the @xmath2-point correlation functions are described by the real - space convolution of halo density profiles .    in the halo approach",
    ", we assume that all the matter is in halos with the density profile @xmath17 parameterized by a mass @xmath18 .",
    "the halo mass is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the virial volume of the halo .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the normalized halo profile defined as @xmath21 , satisfying the condition @xmath22 in this paper we employ the _ virial _ volume as the boundary of a given halo , which can be formally defined , for example , based on the spherical top - hat collapse model .",
    "however , since in reality some matter is distributed outside the virial region , it is non - trivial to choose which boundary condition to use for the halo model . we will discuss how this uncertainty affects the halo model predictions , and show that it does not matter in the non - linear regime",
    ".    the density field at some point can be given by the superposition of each halo density profile : @xmath23 .",
    "the mean density of the universe is thus obtained from the ensemble average ( scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ) @xmath24 where we have replaced the ensemble average by a spatial average and an average over the halo mass function @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "note that from equation ( [ eqn : nhalop ] ) the integral over @xmath27 is unity , so the above equation is a statement about the normalization of the halo mass function . throughout this paper we work in the comoving coordinate .    within the framework of the halo approach , the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of the density field can be expressed as the sum of correlations within a single halo ( 1-halo term ) and between different halos ( 2-halo term ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the 2pcf of two halos with mass @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and we have used @xmath32 . here",
    "we have again employed the virial volume for the integration range . in the other words ,",
    "the integration cutoff reflects the fact that we only account for mass contributions out to the virial region . if we require that @xmath33 is a function of the separation @xmath34 alone ( from statistical homogeneity and isotropy ) , then the density profile @xmath35 which we need here is an average over all halos of a given mass so that the resulting 2pcf has no particular direction dependence of @xmath36 ( see similar discussion in seljak 2000 ) .",
    "this holds for a spherically symmetric density profile , which is assumed in this paper for simplicity .",
    "if one considers non - spherically symmetric profiles , it requires some extra averages over all possible shapes of halos of a given mass .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : r2ptfull ] ) shows that we can obtain @xmath37 by a 3-dimensional integration for a spherically symmetric density profile , while the 2-halo term needs an 8-dimensional integration at most .    in the same spirit as the derivation of equation ( [ eqn : r2ptfull ] )",
    ", we can derive expressions for the 1-halo contribution to the @xmath2-point correlation function ( @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 interestingly , this equation means that we can obtain any @xmath2-point correlation function by a 4-dimensional integration , once the density profile and the mass function are given .",
    "the 1-halo contribution is expected to be dominant in the strongly non - linear regime @xmath40 , and so the real - space halo approach can be useful for calculations in this regime .    in this paper , we focus on the halo model predictions of the 3pcf , which is the lowest order statistic for describing non - gaussianity of the density field . the 1-halo term can be expressed as @xmath41 under the assumption of statistical symmetry , the 3pcf can be described by three independent parameters characterizing triangle configurations . likewise , the 2- and 3-halo terms in 3pcf can be derived within the real - space halo approach ( ma & fry 2000c ) ; for example , the 2-halo term becomes @xmath42 this equation implies that we have to perform at most an 8-dimensional integration to get @xmath43 for a given halo - halo correlation function , @xmath44 , while the 3-halo contribution to @xmath45 similarly requires the 12-dimensional integration .",
    "most recent studies of the halo approach has relied on the method build in the fourier space ( seljak 2000 ; ma & fry 2000c ; peacock & smith 2000 ; scoccimarro et al . 2001 ; cooray & hu 2001a , b ; tj02 ) , since the fourier - transformed counterparts of the @xmath2-point correlation function ( power spectrum , bispectrum and etc . ) can be expressed simply .    following the notation introduced in cooray & hu ( 2001a )",
    ", the power spectrum can be expressed as the sum of the 1-halo and 2-halo contributions @xmath46",

    "quantities with tilde symbols denote the corresponding fourier transformed quantities .",
    "notice that all relevant quantities also depend on redshift , although we often omit it in the argument for simplicity .",
    "in contrast to the truncated halo profile above , ma & fry ( 2000c ) employed the non - truncated profile whose fourier transform is defined over an infinity integration range as @xmath53 .",
    "the different halo boundary leads to different results in the fourier - space halo model .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the difference between the predictions for the mass bispectrum in ma & fry ( 2000b ) , scoccimarro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and cooray & sheth ( 2002 ) in comparison with the real - space halo model for the 3pcf in this paper . in the derivation of equation ( [ eqn : ps ] )",
    ", we have assumed that the power spectrum for the halo - halo 2pcf can be given by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the linear power spectrum and @xmath56 denotes the bias parameter between the distribution of halos and the underlying density field . through the definition @xmath57",
    ", we can compute the 2pcf of the density field from the power spectrum ( [ eqn : ps ] ) within the framework of the fourier - space halo model .",
    "the two derivations of @xmath33 based on the real - space and fourier - space halo approaches should be equivalent to each other .",
    "however , the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath58 uses a fourier transform over the infinite volume , while the integrations used in the halo model ( see equations ( [ eqn : r2ptfull ] ) and ( [ eqn : fum ] ) ) are confined to the virial volume of halos .",
    "this could lead to some discrepancies between the two halo model predictions for @xmath33 , which will be carefully investigated below .",
    "likewise , the fourier - transformed counterpart of the mass 3pcf , the bispectrum , can be expressed as the sum of the three contributions where three dark matter particles reside in one halo ( 1-halo ) or in two ( 2-halo ) and three ( 3-halo ) different halos , respectively : @xmath59 + i_1 ^ 1(k_1)i_1 ^ 1(k_2)i^1_1(k_3)b^{pt}({\\mbox{{\\it \\boldmath$k$}}}_1,{\\mbox{{\\it \\boldmath$k$}}}_2,{\\mbox{{\\it \\boldmath$k$}}}_3 ) .",

    ", we briefly compare the real - space and fourier - space halo approaches for predicting the 3pcf of the mass distribution .",
    "let us first consider the 1-halo contribution to the 3pcf .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : r3pt ] ) shows that , once the halo profile and mass function are given , the real - space halo model enables us to obtain the 1-halo term by a 4-dimensional integration for arbitrary triangle shapes . on the other hand ,",
    "equations ( [ eqn : bisp ] ) and ( [ eqn : f3pt ] ) imply that a 7-dimensional integration at most is required to get the 1-halo term based on the fourier - space halo model , which is intractable with current computational expenses .",
    "therefore , the real - space halo approach has a great advantage in predicting the 1-halo term of the 3pcf .",
    "however , the fourier - space approach becomes useful for predicting the 2-halo and 3-halo terms , because the real - space model requires at most 8- and 12-dimensional integrations for calculating the 2- and 3-halo terms for given 2pcf and 3pcf of the halo distribution . on the other hand , from equations ( [ eqn : bisp ] ) and ( [ eqn : f3pt ] ) , one can see that the fourier - space model allows us to obtain the 2- and 3-halo terms basically by a 7-dimensional integration . however , direct integration is still intractable .",
    "therefore , in this paper we employ the fourier - space model and develop approximations for calculating the 2- and 3-halo terms .",
    "those approximations can significantly reduce the computational expenses and make the calculations tractable by regular numerical integrations , but still have adequate accuracy for our purpose .      to complete the halo model approach",
    ", we need suitable models for the three ingredients : the halo density profile , the mass function of halos and the biasing of the halo distribution , each of which depends on halo mass @xmath18 and redshift @xmath64 and have been well studied in the literature .",
    "we consider density profiles of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the central density parameter and @xmath67 is the concentration parameter . in most parts of this paper",
    ", we will take the nfw profile with @xmath68 ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "however , since other simulations with higher spatial resolution have indicated @xmath69 @xcite , we will consider the effects of the variation in @xmath70 on the 2- and 3-point correlation functions .",
    "the parameter @xmath66 can be eliminated by the definition ( [ eqn : massdef ] ) of halo mass as @xmath71 where @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 denotes the hypergeometric function .",
    "we employ the virial radius given by the spherical top - hat collapse model : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the overdensity of collapse given as a function of redshift ( e.g. , see nakamura & suto 1997 and henry 2000 for a useful fitting formula ) .",
    "we have @xmath76 for the @xmath7cdm  model .",
    "to give the halo profile in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath64 , we further need to express the concentration parameter @xmath67 in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath64 ; however , this still remains somewhat uncertain .",

    "is taken based on the numerical simulation results in bullock et al .",
    "we take @xmath87 and @xmath88 as our reference model for the nfw profile , because tj02 pointed out that the model can reproduce simulation results for the variance , skewness of weak lensing fields and the shear kurtosis .",
    "we will consider the influence of variations in the concentration parameter on the halo model predictions of the 2pcf and 3pcf .",
    "we will often use the following useful form for the fourier transform of the nfw profile ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is needed for the fourier - space halo model calculations : @xmath89 , \\label{eqn : fumnfw}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the cosine integral function and @xmath92 the sine integral .",
    "the profile ( [ eqn : nfw ] ) with general @xmath70 has the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "it is worth stressing that the equation above is derived from the nfw profile truncated at the virial radius to maintain mass conservation ( see equations ( [ eqn : massdef ] ) and ( [ eqn : avedens ] ) ) .",
    "the truncated profile leads to the consequence that the 1-halo term of the power spectrum behaves like shot - noise as @xmath97 at small @xmath98 .",

    "this bias model is used for calculations of the 2-halo term in the 2pcf and the 2- and 3-halo terms in the 3pcf ( see equations ( [ eqn : ps ] ) and ( [ eqn : bisp ] ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that the requirement that the 2-halo term in the power spectrum gives the linear power spectrum in the limit @xmath99 ( @xmath114 ) imposes the condition @xmath115 for the integration mass range , since we have assumed that all the matter is in the form of virialized halos .",

    "this uncertainty needs further investigation by comparison with ray - tracing simulation results .",
    "the figure also shows that , on very small scales @xmath367 , the 1-halo term of @xmath0 decreases slightly with decreasing angular scale .",

    "we have shown results for the three - dimensional mass and galaxy distributions and the two - dimensional weak lensing convergence field .",
    "the halo model enables us to separately consider the contributions to the 3pcf arising from triplets in a single halo or two or three different halos .",
    "thus we can understand how gravitational clustering transitions from the quasi - linear regime to the strongly non - linear regime as one goes to smaller scales .",

    "we also developed approximations for computing the 2- and 3-halo contributions to the 3pcf .",

    "in fact , very recently smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed a weak violation of the stable clustering hypothesis using high - resolution @xmath6-body simulations .",
    "however , our halo model predictions for the 3pcf do not match the asymptotic shape proposed in ma & fry ( 2000b ) because of the assumptions employed in the asymptotic formula .",
    "therefore , it it merits further study to carefully investigate how small - scale gravitational clustering can be described by the halo model ingredients .",
    "such a study can be carried out with the halo model methods developed in this paper .",
    "we also found that the non - linear 3pcf is most sensitive to the inner slope of the halo profile and to the halo concentration parameter for given cosmological parameters ( see figures [ fig : qprofr001 ] , [ fig : qprofr01 ] and [ fig : qalpha ] ) .",
    "combinations of the inner slope and the concentration can be adjusted so that the halo model matches the 2pcf result ( see figure [ fig:2ptdep ] ) .",

    "hence in combination with the 2pcf , the non - linear 3pcf could be used to constrain the properties of dark matter halos .",
    "we suggest that the use of higher order correlations is a useful way of measuring the properties of massive halos . for example , while lensing surveys of clusters can be used to measure cluster halo profiles directly , this involves identifying cluster centers and assigning masses to clusters to measure averaged profiles .",

    "figure [ fig : qparauv ] shows that the predicted @xmath0 parameter for equilateral triangles has a bump at this scale , which corresponds to the bump found for the reduced bispectrum at @xmath377 by scoccimarro et al .",
    "this is unlikely to reflect real properties of dark matter clustering .",
    "rather , we argued that the bump feature is sensitive to the sharp cutoff of halos at the virial radius and the exclusion effect for the 2- and 3-halo terms .",
    "we explored alternative prescriptions as shown in figure [ fig : excl ] . to resolve this ,",
    "detailed calculations and comparisons of the halo model predictions with simulation results will be needed .",

    "for the halo occupation number for red galaxies we have used , the galaxy 3pcf has a smaller amplitude and weaker dependence on triangle configuration compared to the mass 3pcf ( figures [ fig : qgal ] and [ fig : qgaluv ] ) .",
    "this trend is indeed consistent with the actual measurements in jing & brner ( 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3pcf of blue galaxies displays complex features reflecting the input model of the halo occupation number .",
    "thus , the galaxy 3pcf can be used to constrain the galaxy formation scenario as a function of host halo properties and galaxy type .",
    "further work is needed to model the expected properties of galaxies by type for specific surveys and compute the resulting 3pcf .    as an example of the angular 3pcf ,",
    "we have computed the 3pcf of the weak lensing convergence field .",
    "in particular , we employed the real - space halo model to compute the single halo contribution , as for the 3d case , which enabled us to compute the 1-halo term by a 4-dimensional integration .",
    "we verified that the real - space halo model is equivalent to the fourier - space model well studied in the literature ( see figure [ fig : ang2pt ] ) .",

    ", we presented a brief investigation of the 3pcfs of shear fields , where we found good agreement between the halo model prediction and the results measured from the ray - tracing simulations .",
    "it is also expected that the @xmath2-point correlations of weak lensing on sub - arcminute scales contain a wealth of information on properties of massive halos , beyond their dependence on cosmological parameters .",
    "the real - space halo model we have developed will be a useful analytical tool for such calculations .",
    "the halo model presented in this paper allows for several interesting applications .",
    "first , the model can be extended to investigate the effect of triaxial halo shapes on the 3pcf , since it is the lowest - order statistical probe of non - sphericity .",
    "so far halo model applications assume a single , spherically symmetric profile .",
    "recently , based on high - resolution simulations , jing & suto ( 2002 ) showed that halos are more accurately described by triaxial halo profiles than the spherically symmetric nfw profile .",
    "they claimed that the axis ratios typically have vales of @xmath378 for the smallest and largest axis .",
    "the non - sphericity of the halo profile could lead to a characteristic configuration dependence of the 3pcf .",
    "this effect should also affect the interpretation of cosmic shear measurements ( jing 2002 ) .",
    "likewise , the formulation developed in sheth & jain ( 2002 ) can be used to discuss the effects of substructure within halos on the 2pcf and 3pcf .",
    "the real - space halo model can be directly used to compute the covariance of the 2pcf . as discussed in cooray & hu ( 2001b ) , the mass distribution on small scales displays pronounced non - gaussian features induced by non - linear gravitational clustering .",

    "the isothermal assumption for the velocity distribution within a given halo was employed to analytically obtain the pvd based on the halo model ( sheth et al .",
    "it is important to clarify whether the bbgky hierarchy leads to a self - consistent pvd for the cdm model .",
