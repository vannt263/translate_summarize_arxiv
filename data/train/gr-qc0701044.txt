    "* on the rotation - spin coupling * , the phenomenon of rotation - spin coupling illustrates the inertia of intrinsic spin , and its existence was first proposed by mashhoon mas74,mas88,mas99,mas20,tiom96 .",
    "an experiment to test for the existence of this term has been studied by mashhoon _",
    "et al . _ and many others masexp1,masexp2,silv , sted97,lamb02 .",
    "it then follows easily ryder92 that the coupling of spin with rotation holds also at the relativistic level .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this only holds in @xmath3rydermash .",
    "the straightforward theoretical derivations of the inertial effect of dirac particle have been performed by hehl and his collaborators n , hehlexp1 , and these treatments have been extended in several directions by a number of investigators uang , zcm01 , however , where the relativistic factor has not been considered .",
    "hehl and ni n have calculated spin coupling hamiltonian in an arbitrary noninertial frame , one subject both to rotation and to acceleration , and rotation - spin coupling is a result of their special case of zero acceleration . while , with regard to the existed references , we stress that the metric tensor implied from the exploited tetrad by many authors rydermash , hn , huang , tiom62,chap , ni78 is not a minkowski one , or the spacetime curvature exists , which seems to declaim that the rotation produces the spacetime curvature .",
    "moreover , there is no role of relativistic factor in their tetrads , and they have to constrain their discussions within the light cylinder ( @xmath4 ) rydermash because of the velocity limit of speed of light . in principle",
    ", the description of rotation - spin might be in the special relativistic level and application of this effect could be extended anywhere in the rotational frame , within or beyond the light cylinder .",
    "* on the torsion - spin coupling * , it is one of most important characteristics for the torsion gravity to compare with the general relativity ( gr ) . as a special version of torsion gravity ,",
    "the parallelism of general relativity ( pgr ) has been pursued by a number of authors  @xcite , where the spacetime is characterized by the torsion tensor and the vanishing curvature , named weitzenbck spacetime  @xcite , which can be reduced from the riemann - cartan spacetime where the generalized metric - affine theory of gravitation is constructed 76,hehl95,hehl99,per032 .",
    "pgr will be equivalent to gr with the convenient choice of the parameters of the lagrangian ay79 , however based on the tetrad pgr is a powerful and a natural tool to describe the dirac field per045 .    in notation of the symbols , we will use the greek alphabet ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 ) to denote tensor indices , that is , indices related to spacetime . the latin alphabet ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  @xmath8 ) will be used to denote local lorentz ( or tangent space ) indices .",
    "the tensor and local lorentz indices can be changed into each other with the use of the tetrad @xmath12 , which satisfy e^a _",
    "e_a^ = _ ^ ; e^a _ e_b^ = ^a_b .",
    "[ orto ] a nontrivial tetrad field can be used to define the linear cartan connectionay79,perbook    ^ _",
    "= e_a^_e^a _ , [ car ] with respect to which the cartan connection is  ay79,perbook t^ _",
    "= ^ _ - ^ _ .",
    "[ tor ] the metric is g _ = _ a b e^a _ e^b _ , [ gmn ] where @xmath13 is the metric in flat space with the line element    d^2 = g _",
    "dx^ dx^ , the irreducible torsion axial - vector can then be constructed as  ay79,perbook , pvz a _",
    "= 16_t^ , with @xmath14 being the completely antisymmetric tensor normalized as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where g is the determinant of metric .",
    "the spacetime dynamic effects on the spin is incorporated into dirac equation through the `` spin connection '' appearing in the dirac equation in gravitation @xcite . in weitzenbck",
    "spacetime , as well as the general version of torsion gravity , it has been shown by many authors  ay79,nh80,hehl71,tra72,rum79,yas80,aud81,ham94,ham95,ham02 that the spin precession of a dirac particle is intimately related to the torsion axial - vector , and it is interesting to note that the torsion axial - vector represents the deviation of the axial symmetry from the spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "= - 32 , [ precession1 ] where @xmath17 is the semiclassical spin vector of a dirac particle , and @xmath18 is the spacelike part of the torsion axial - vector .",
    "therefore , the corresponding extra hamiltonian energy is of the form ,    h = - 32 .",
    "[ ham2 ]    based on the torsion - spin coupling above , the lense - thirring precession of dirac spin has been obtained pvz by the standard kerr tetrad , and the rotation - spin precession can be achieved as well zcm01,zcm03 .",
    "the purpose of the paper is constructing the connection between the torsion - spin coupling and the rotation - spin coupling , and especially we want to cope with the realistic physical conditions that includes the position outside the light cylinder ( @xmath4 , see also rydermash ) or the case of the tangent velocity of the disk exceeding over the speed of light c. for this end , the rotational tetrad is defined and the resultant metric is a minkowski one , then the rotation - spin will be derived from the torsion - spin inferred from the systematical dirac equation treatment .",
    "the motivation of the paper has two aspects , we firstly demonstrate that the rotation - spin can be described by the special torsion gravity , the parallelism description of general relativity , which possesses the deep theoretical foundations , and secondly the correct or effective description of rotation - spin will help us recognize the new applications of torsion conception . on the latter , we may be confident of that we are extending the geometric - dynamics from the gravitation ( riemannian curved spacetime ) to the rotation ( cartan torsional spacetime ) .",
    "* the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the rotation - spin coupling by introducing the position - dependent angular velocity , and the new rotation - spin coupling formula is derived .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in the last section . *",
    "now we discuss the dirac equation in the rotational coordinate system with the polar coordinates @xmath19 with the rotating angular velocity @xmath0 set in z - direction .",
    "the tetrad can be expressed by the dual basis of the differential one - form n , ho through choosing a coframe of the rotational coordinate system zcm03 ,    [ coframe0 ] d^ & = & , + d^ & = & dr , + d^ & = & , [ coframe ] + d^&= & dz , where the relativistic factor @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is much less than the speed of light c , then we have @xmath22 and the classical coframe expression is recovered , which is same as those applied in the existed references n , zcm01 . therefore eq.([coframe0 ] ) and eq.([coframe ] ) is a generalized relativistic coframe expression for any rotation velocity , low or high energy cases .",
    "however , if @xmath23 , then the relativistic factor will be meaningless , which will happen in the case of either @xmath0 or r being too large .",
    "* therefore , in order to overcome this difficulty , we make choice of a nonuniform and position - dependent angular velocity , written as * ( r ) = 1+(r / c ) .",
    "[ omer ] thus , the line velocity at radius r @xmath24 will not exceed over the speed of light . if @xmath25 or @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is implied from eq.([omer ] ) and means that the angular velocity at the center of rotating object is higher than that of far apart .",
    "while , eq.([omer ] ) help us overcome the infinity difficulty in describing the line velocity of rotating system by considering the limited propagation velocity in the non - rigid disk .",
    "the relativistic factor is now modified as @xmath29 .",
    "the tetrad can be obtained with the subscript @xmath5 denoting the column index ( c.f .",
    "n , zcm01 ) through replacing the original constant @xmath0 of @xmath30 , with the conventional usage of the unit of speed of light c=1 ,    e^a _ = , [ te1 ] with its inverse    e_a^ = .",
    "[ te2 ]    we can inspect that the tetrad expressions eqs.([te1 ] ) and ( [ te2 ] ) satisfy the orthogonal conditions in eqs.([orto ] ) and ( [ gmn ] ) . from the tetrad",
    "given above , we have the line element and the implied metric , d^2 & = & _ abd^a d^b = g_dx^dx^ + & = & dt^2 - ( dr^2 + r^2d^2 + dz^2 ) , [ dsr ] and with the determinant of the metric g = det||= -r^2 .",
    "we find that the metric in eq.([dsr ] ) is a minkowski one mtw , resulting in the null riemannian and cartan curvatures .",
    "although the curvature vanishes , the torsion ( field ) may have nonzero components because the torsion is determined by the tetrad and not by the metric .",
    "in other words , the basic element in the parallelism description of general relativity is the tetrad and the metric exploited is just a by - product ay79,perbook , per041,per042,h76,per032 . from eqs.([te1 ] ) and ( [ te2 ] ) , we can now construct the cartan connection , whose components to contribute to the non - vanishing torsion axial - vectors are : ^2_01 = - ( ^2f ) /r = - ( r)/r , ^0_21 = -(^2f ) r",
    "= - ( r)r , with the factor definition f=1 - ( r)r . the corresponding non - vanishing torsion components contributed to the axial torsion - vectors are :    t^2_01 = - ( r)/r , t^0_21 = - ( r ) r , and the non - vanishing torsion axial - vectors are consequently    a_3 = 23(r ) , a_k = 0 , k=0,1,2 .    as shown , @xmath31 is on account of the z - axis symmetry which results in the cancelling of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 components , and then generally we can write the torsion axial - vector in the usual vector expression @xmath34 . from the spacetime geometry view , the torsion axial - vector represents the deviation from the spherical symmetry , which will disappear in the spherical case ( schwarzschild spacetime for instance ) and occurs in the axisymmetry case ( kerr spacetime for instance ) nh80,pvz . if the physical measurement is performed in the rotating frame , the time dt is taken as the proper time through setting the null space difference .",
    "therefore the torsion axial - vector corresponds to an inertia field with respect to dirac spin , which is now clearly expressed as a precession equation by eq.([precession1 ] ) ,    = - ( r ) .",
    "[ precession2 ] the additive energy in the rotating frame is h = - ( r ) , [ ham2 ] which is a similar form as that expected by mashhoon ( c.f .",
    "ref.mas88,mas20 ) except the introduced varied angular velocity with the radius r for the sake of avoiding the infinite line velocity .",
    "* the obtained results of this paper are summarized in the following : *    the mashhoon rotation - spin coupling has been derived from the torsion - spin coupling by means of the parallelism of general relativity , where dirac equation in the external field is treated by the introduced rotational tetrad . in the relativistic rotational tetrad , which has resulted in the flat metric",
    ", the relativistic factor @xmath2 is introduced , but it needs the tangent velocity of the observer to be less than the speed of light . in order to satisfy the need of the upper limit of velocity , we choose to make the rotation nonuniform and position - dependent in a way as described in eq.([omer ] ) .",
    "then this choice makes the tangent velocity expression of rotating observer not exceed the speed of light at any positions , within or outside the light cylinder . on the description of the mashhoon rotation - spin coupling in our parallelism version , the choice of tetrad will produce a minkowski metric , a flat spacetime one , which arises a new conclusions on the spacetime torsion and curvature .",
    "the rotational field can be an independent source for the production of torsion , and even the gravitational field switches off .",
    "the existence of torsion in the flat spacetime , or the minkowski spacetime , can help us change the point of view that there is no torsion in the flat spacetime ay79,perbook , h76 .",
    "the extra additive energy of the mashhoon rotation - spin coupling is expressed to be @xmath35 , so in the low speed limit of the present - day laboratory @xmath36 , this coupling energy is still @xmath37 as obtained by mashhoon before mas74,mas88,mas99 .",
    "however , at the light cylinder of rotating neutron star , @xmath38 , the mashhoon rotation - spin coupling will be half of that on the surface of star , then we can not sure if this effect can be detected in the observations of the electromagnetic emissions in the rotating x - ray neutron stars and black holes klis04 .",
    "the quasi periodic oscillations of x - ray flux have been discovered in many x - ray neutron star and black hole systems since the launch of rxte satellite klis04 , however these phenomena have not yet been explained . whether or not some oscillations of the x - ray energy are involved in the mashhoon rotation - spin coupling",
    "still needs a thorough investigation .",
