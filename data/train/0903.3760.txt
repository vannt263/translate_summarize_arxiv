    "in 1984 cummings and stell @xcite proposed a simplified hamiltonian model for a reactive system of two types of homogeneus fluids with the same density and diameter . in this model , type @xmath6 and @xmath7 molecules , can be associated by means of a selective square interaction that , in the appropiate limits , can be reduced to a sticky baxter s potential @xcite located inside the hard core at a distance from the center of the particle @xmath2 .",
    "the cases of @xmath8 for the baxter s function have been solved in @xcite using the same formalism and , at @xcite , they apply the results for a pair of reactive fluids and a solvent .",
    "lee and rasaiah solved the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and proposed a solution for @xmath11 for chemical association and dipolar dumbbells @xcite .",
    "the model of lee and rasaiah of association in electrolytes @xmath12 is studied in @xcite . in this case",
    "the authors add a selective coulombian part , @xmath13 , out of core , to the associating original csm .",
    "the sticky site inside the hard core incorporates geometrical conditions of steric saturation in the molecule and this idea is shown , using computational simulations in different ensembles , in ref .",
    "for different bonding length parameters the system allows formation of dimers for small @xmath5 , chains for @xmath5 slightly larger , and vulcanization of species for bonding length values close to the diameter @xmath14 of particles .",
    "huerta and naumis studied the connectivity of a binary mixture using a selectively hard sphere potential and a superposition as @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath5 is the bonding distance , @xmath0 the intracore square well width and @xmath19 , @xmath20 represents the species in the mixture .",
    "the final potential ( see figure [ potential ] ) is equivalent to the original cummings - stell in the adecuate limits for sticky approximation .    the same idea is implemented by pizio and blum @xcite for a hard - sphere fluid with dimerization @xmath21 . in the development",
    "most of the models maintain @xmath5 as a parameter ( bonding distance ) and finally take the case @xmath22 , however some other possibilities are presents having the analytical solution for arbitrary @xmath5 .",
    "kalyuzhnyi and stell @xcite present a recount of cases for different ranges of the location @xmath5 .",
    "as we show here , the sticky potential into the hard sphere shell produces a discontinuity step in the auxiliary functions of baxter .",
    "this fact allows us to think of systems with more than one sticky site inside the shell or , even , a distribution of sticky wells .",
    "the vertical dashed arrows show the sense of the baxter s sticky limit @xcite .",
    "the molecular diameter is @xmath14 and the dashed curves ( with labels `` aa '' and `` ab '' ) corresponds to the colulombian interaction for electrolyte @xcite .    in the following sections , we first develop the matrix of differential and shift operators mdso , and its inverse , for the simplest case @xmath23 , followed for the inversion of the mdso s for a very general case that corresponds to the set of @xmath4 dde s , to @xmath4 subintervals of [ 0 , @xmath14 ] and to a sticky location @xmath25 .",
    "the statistical mechanical model of chemical reactions of cummings and stell @xcite represents the association of two species @xmath26 , with the same density and diameter , which simplifies the mathematical problem .",
    "the potential proposed in the csm consists of a hard sphere repulsion between like species ( @xmath6-@xmath6 or @xmath7-@xmath7 ) and a mound of width @xmath14 with a deep , narrow , and attractive square well , with width @xmath0 centred on @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 interactions : @xmath30 the geometric consideration of this model for the @xmath29 interactions ensures steric saturation in the system ( there is no formation of @xmath4-mers for @xmath31 ) due to overlapping .",
    "in addition , this model has a solution in the py approximation , mapping the square well onto an infinitely deep and stretch well like the sticky potential of baxter @xcite .",
    "the connection between the baxter s original and this model , is obtained equating the second virial coefficients : first it is considered the limit @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the limits of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are taken to maintain tractable the problem in the py approximation @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath35 ( in the repulsive part : see figure [ potential ] ) does nt change very much the results , but simplifies the solution @xcite .",
    "the total and direct correlation functions are related by the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation that , for this binary mixture , can be written as @xcite @xmath36 where the integral is evaluated in the whole space , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the number density of species @xmath39 particles . in the csm",
