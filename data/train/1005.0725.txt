    "for example , the orbifold @xmath2 itself appears as a connected component of @xmath3 : indeed it is the locus fixed by the identity , which is trivially contained in the stabilizer group of every point .",

    "the main techniques used in this paper are : abelian cyclic coverings of curves ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , their moduli spaces and their compactifications by means of admissible coverings , and some elementary deformation theory of nodal curves .",

    "we give pictures of these twisted sectors using stable graphs , and some twisted sectors of moduli of curves of genus lower than @xmath0 .",

    "the surjectivity of the pull - back map in the latter case is obtained in corollary [ corollariogetzler ] for the even cohomology .",
    "the proof of corollary [ corollariogetzler ] is conditional to getzler s conjecture [ getzlerremark ] .",
