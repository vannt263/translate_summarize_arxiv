    "type ii supernovae ( sne ) that undergo a long , bright , flat phase in photometric evolution are commonly referred to as plateau sne ( ) .",
    "these have been shown over the past decade to be good `` standardizable candles , '' and potential cosmological probes , in a manner similar to that of their more famous cousins , sne  ia .",
    "@xcite were the first to demonstrate this empirical `` standardizable candle method '' ( scm ) , a technique which was later streamlined and applied to larger samples by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n06 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p09 ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "p09 used a sample of 34  to constrain the three parameters that define the correlation : a reference absolute magnitude in the @xmath1 band , a velocity term that is correlated with the luminosity during the plateau , and a color term that minimizes the contribution from intrinsic color inhomogeneity as well as from dust extinction .",
    "the resulting intrinsic scatter in the hubble diagram was found to be 0.22mag , which is equivalent to about 10% in distance , similar to the result of n06 despite the larger sample . since the samples used by n06 and p09 are dominated by nearby sne that sport large distance uncertainties due to peculiar velocities ,",
    "a robust derivation of the scm parameters , together with a determination of its potential power , requires a set of sne  ii - p in the hubble flow .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d10 ) presented such a sample of 15  in the hubble flow from the sloan digital sky survey ii ( sdss - ii ) sn survey , albeit obtained during a project that was focused on sne  ia .",
    "the scm method relies on photospheric velocities measured from the  @xmath25169 absorption line during the plateau phase , specifically about 50 days past explosion . as noted by d10",
    ", however , the optical spectra of their sne  ii - p are usually of low signal - to - noise ratio ( 2n ) and taken at an early epoch , when  lines are not fully developed .",
    "this observation strategy , while complicating the application of the scm method to , was dictated by the main purpose of their survey , which was to identify sne  ia and measure their redshifts in order to use them as distance indicators @xcite .",
    "d10 find that adding their sample to those analyzed previously increases the scatter significantly , to 15% in distance .",
    "this points to a failure of the data , method , or underlying model .",
    "while d10 conscientiously explore many possible sources for this scatter , we show below that most of it is due to a systematic offset , and could be explained by two effects : the method used to determine the photospheric velocities , and an observational bias . in  [ s : vel ] we rederive photospheric velocities for their sample using  absorption lines , as applied by n06 to their sample of higher redshift sne .",
    "we calibrate the relation between  velocities and the standard  velocities in ",
    "[ s : hb ] . in  [ s : hd ] we update the hubble diagram and discuss the specific selection effects that bias the sdss - ii sample .",
    "4861 and  @xmath25169 using 28 spectra of 13  at phases of 5 to 40 days after explosion .",
    "the shaded area marks the 1@xmath3 region for the derived correlation , @xmath4 .",
    "velocities can be well determined using , which is easier to detect in early - phase and low-2n spectra .",
    "squares with dashed error bars mark  velocities derived for objects with very high  velocities using eq . 2 of n06 .",
    "the outlier at @xmath5kms@xmath0 is from a very early spectrum ( 2 days past explosion ) of the low - luminosity , low - velocity sn2005cs.,width=288 ]",
    "in order to derive photospheric velocities , d10 apply to their spectra the algorithm developed by p09 . briefly , using the `` sn identification code '' ( snid ; @xcite ) , the spectra are cross - correlated with a library of high-2n  templates for which  velocities can be measured precisely .",
    "p09 successfully applied this method to 19 nearby sne  ii - p that typically had a few high-2n  spectra per object , many of them near day 50 after explosion .",
    "d10 correctly point out that this method may not be applicable to their sample , due to the early epoch at which they were obtained and their low 2n .",
    "the  lines usually become fully developed after a few weeks past explosion . even at later times",
    "those lines are often weak , making velocity derivation from low-2n  spectra problematic .",
    "we rederive the velocities for the sdss - ii sample using another method , and find values that are typically different from those of d10 .",
    "these in turn improve the scatter in the hubble diagram , as demonstrated in ",
    "[ s : hd ] .",
    "n06 showed that there is a correlation between the velocities measured from  @xmath24861 and those derived from  @xmath25169 . in the next section",
    "we improve the determination of that correlation using many more objects and spectra .",
    "we obtain the photospheric velocities for the sdss - ii sample as follows . from each spectrum",
    "we measure the  velocity , and where feasible , the  velocity .",
    "this is done by finding the minimum of the absorption line .",
    "when the 2n  is too low we smooth the spectra with a savitzky - golay filter ( which is similar to a running mean ; @xcite ) . for most of the sdss - ii spectra ,",
    "@xmath25169 is either undeveloped or buried in the noise .",
    "the  velocities are translated to equivalent  velocities using the relation found in  [ s : hb ] ( with the uncertainty in that relationship folded in quadrature ) . for every spectrum that does have a direct  velocity measurement ,",
    "we calculate a weighted mean between the direct and indirect values . these velocities and uncertainties",

    "n06 propose an alternative velocity proxy to , using the  absorption line that is both present early and significantly more prominent .",
    "we repeat the analysis of n06 using the much larger sample of p09 and derive a new relation between the two velocities .",
    "we use 28 spectra of 13  that span ages of 5 to 40 days past explosion ; both lines are readily identifiable in all of the spectra .",
    "we restrict ourselves to spectra obtained prior to day 40 , since at later times  @xmath25169 is at least as strong as , which also becomes blended with other lines that can bias the velocity measurement .",
    "we measure the velocities as described for the sdss - ii sne in ",
    "[ s : vel ] .",
    "as seen in figure  [ f : hbeta ] , we find a robust ( @xmath6 ) linear correlation that can be represented as @xmath7 .",
    "the uncertainty is equivalent to an additional error of about 200400kms@xmath0 over the relevant range of velocities . while this relation is somewhat different from the one derived by n06 , in practice it gives similar results for the range of velocities probed by the sdss - ii sample .",
    "since there are very few objects in the p09 sample having velocities higher than 8,000kms@xmath0 in which both lines are well developed , we add to figure  [ f : hbeta ] nine early - epoch , high - velocity spectra where the  lines are not detected . in order to approximate the  velocity at those times",
    ", we use the velocity derived for these objects at day 50 in p09 , and propagate them to the correct epoch using equation 2 of n06 which models the time evolution of  velocities .",
    "most of the additional spectra seem to agree with the relationship derived above , with two notable exceptions .",
    "one is sn2005cs ( 2 days past explosion ) with a derived  velocity which is much too high .",
    "this object was a low - luminosity , low - velocity sn  ii - p , and is of little relevance to nonlocal samples .",
    "the second exception is that at  velocities higher than 10,000kms@xmath0 the scatter increases significantly .",
    "this may be due to a combination of line blending at these high velocities , combined with very blue continua that make absorption minima harder to define and measure .",
    "all of the sne in the d10 sample have a spectrum with  velocity smaller than 10,000kms@xmath0 . while these exceptions are not relevant to the reanalysis of the d10 sample , one should be cautious and remember that this correlation may break down for spectra with extremely high or low velocities .",
    "when minimizing the `` cost function '' ( equation 4 of p09 ) in order to determine the best - fit parameters , p09 find an intrinsic scatter of 0.22 mag ( d10 measure it to be 0.20 mag when minimizing a slightly different function ) , which is equivalent to @xmath810% in distance , similar to the result of n06 .",
    "d10 report an increase to 0.29 mag ( which we measure to be 0.32 mag ) when adding the sdss - ii sample , which is about 50% more scatter .",
    "an important clue to the source of this additional dispersion is provided by figure 5 of d10 , which clearly shows that the sdss - ii sne are systematically offset from the hubble law , with all but one of them falling below the line .",
    "in fact , the scatter is reduced significantly by artificially dimming the sdss - ii sne by 0.4 mag , ending up even smaller than that reported by p09 .",
    "we repeat the analysis of d10 using all of their data , except for the velocities and their respective uncertainties , where we substitute those we find in  [ s : vel ] .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ f : hd ] , this eliminates a substantial fraction of the systematic offset , which in turn reduces the intrinsic scatter to 0.25 mag ( 11% in distance ) , only slightly higher than without this sample .",
    "our best - fit parameters for the combined sample are nearly identical to those of p09 , except for the reference absolute magnitude which is 0.1 mag brighter for the combined sample .    deriving the parameters using only the sdss - ii sample , we still find preferred values for the correlation coefficients that are offset from those of p09 .",
    "the sdss - ii sne appear to be predominantly overluminous , and favor a small value for the velocity correlation coefficient . following the suggestion made by d10",
    ", we show below that this is largely due to an observational bias arising from the sdss - ii follow - up criteria .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations , starting from a sn population that mimics the properties of the p09 sample , to which we apply various observational cuts . for these simulated samples",
    "we then compute the best - fit correlation parameters .",
    "we find that a simple magnitude cut can not produce such biased values .",
    "however , selecting objects that are _ intrinsically brighter _ skews the parameter derivation in the right direction .",
    "folding in the larger velocity uncertainties allows us to reproduce the bias toward luminous sne with little correlation . indeed ,",
    "when one selects only luminous sne , it is not surprising that the best - fit reference absolute magnitude is brighter , and the correlation parameters smaller  thus pointing toward a weaker link between luminosity and velocity .",
    "the lack of statistical power of such a sample is reflected by the fact that the parameters derived from the combined set are almost identical to those recovered without including the sdss - ii sample . because the sdss - ii sample does not cover a substantial region of parameter space , it can not significantly constrain the scm parameters .",
    "d10 mention that the contrast between a sn and its host galaxy was a selection criterion for spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "this was obviously done to increase the efficiency of their spectroscopic observing runs and the number of sne  ia they find . unlike a regular  that skews the distribution near the detection limit of the survey ,",
    "such a criterion selects intrinsically bright objects , independent of redshift .",
    "this is evident from the very different luminosity functions of the two samples ( fig",
    ". 7 of d10 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : contrast ] shows that nearly half of the sdss - ii sne are brighter than their host galaxies up to a factor of a few , unlike the samples of p09 and n06 that are consistently fainter than their hosts .",
    "a better understanding of the scm relation , based on larger , less biased samples , will allow a careful determination of the various potential biases , providing a crucial component for constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "-band flux ratios ( sn / host galaxy ) for the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; p09 ) and supernova legacy survey ( snls ; n06 ) samples ( solid line ) and for the sdss - ii sample from d10 ( dotted line ) .",
    "about half of the sdss - ii sne are brighter than their hosts galaxies , a selection effect that removes intrinsically faint objects and skews the estimation of correlation parameters.,width=288 ]",
    "we find that when measuring expansion velocities for the sdss - ii sample of  by using , the scm correlation gives a tight hubble diagram , with a scatter of @xmath811% in distance .",
