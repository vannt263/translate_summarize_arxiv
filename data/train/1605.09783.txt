    "given an arbitrary pure state @xmath100 , its @xmath6-concurrence can be computed as @xmath101 where the @xmath102 are its schmidt coefficients ( i.e. ) , and @xmath103 is a @xmath0 matrix with elements @xmath104 .",
    "we can use the triangle inequality twice to lower bound the determinant as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the identity permutation .",
    "now , let us rename @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "for any two positive numbers @xmath109 , it is immediate to check that @xmath110 indeed , if @xmath111 , the inequality is trivially satisfied . on the other hand , if @xmath112 , we just have to look at the convexity of @xmath113 and @xmath114 . at the extreme points of this interval , i.e. when",
    "@xmath115 , the inequality is saturated . to see what happens in between ,",
    "we compute the second derivatives of @xmath113 and @xmath114 with respect to @xmath116 , for an arbitrary @xmath117 : @xmath118 we readily see that @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 , which means that @xmath113 is convex and @xmath114 is concave , thus @xmath122 and we can write @xmath123 , namely @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in order to prove this new inequality , we begin by rewriting it as @xmath126 note that the modulus makes it completely independent on complex phases , hence we can consider the coefficients @xmath127 to be real for the rest of this proof .",
    "furthermore , the inequality is scale invariant , so we deliberatively fix @xmath128 and , once again , we rewrite @xmath129 where we have defined @xmath130 , and @xmath131 for a set of @xmath9 arbitrary parameters @xmath132^d$ ] .",
    "it is clear that , since one can choose and still find a set @xmath133 that fulfils the required conditions .",
    "as we increase the value of @xmath134 above this threshold , the minimum should still be attained when @xmath135 is as close to zero as possible . such minimal value of @xmath135 is directly obtained by solving the simpler minimization @xmath136 , subject to the original constraints .",
    "this is a straightforward calculation via lagrange multipliers .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is @xmath137 where @xmath138 are lagrange multipliers , and its symmetry already tells us that all the @xmath139 have to be equally valued .",
    "we find @xmath140 for @xmath141 , and @xmath142 .",
    "the multipliers are @xmath143 we see from the form of @xmath144 that @xmath145 . in terms of @xmath134 and @xmath9 ,",
    "an extreme value of @xmath146 is attained when the coefficients are @xmath147 the first solution corresponds to the minimum .",
    "we now prove eq .   by solving for @xmath148 and @xmath125 the more restrictive set of inequalities @xmath149 where @xmath150 is a linear lower bound of @xmath151 that is tight at the extreme values of the interval @xmath152 .",
    "the function @xmath150 exists if @xmath151 is a fully concave function .",
    "one can readily check that this is indeed the case , for the equation @xmath153 has no solution in the relevant domain , hence there are no inflection points .",
    "then one only has to observe the sign of an intermediate point , e.g. @xmath154 .",
    "such function approaches zero exclusively in the asymptotic limit @xmath155 , and it is negative for any other ( finite ) value of @xmath156 , hence @xmath154 is always negative and therefore @xmath151 is a concave function of @xmath134 , for any @xmath9 . taking into account that @xmath157 and @xmath158 , we may then write @xmath150 as @xmath159    finding values of @xmath148 and @xmath125 such that eqs .   and hold is straightforward . by , e.g. , demanding that eq . be tight for @xmath160 , we get rid of one parameter .",
    "we obtain @xmath161 .",
    "then , imposing that eq .",

    ", we can guarantee that eq .",
    "is satisfied for all @xmath134 .",
    "summing up , we use eqs .   and to lower - bound the of an arbitrary bipartite pure state @xmath165 as @xmath166 , where @xmath167 the lower bound for the convex roof extension to mixed states , @xmath29 , hence follows :    @xmath168    where for the last inequality we have used the subadditivity of the root function to write @xmath169",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the proof proceeds through a minimization of the entanglement measure under consideration ( here the @xmath6-concurrence ) on pure states first .",
    "consider therefore @xmath170 with its schmidt decomposition @xmath171 .",
    "the minimization of @xmath172 is under the condition that the fidelity of @xmath165 with the maximally entangled state @xmath173 be fixed , @xmath174 .",
    "we use a fact noted by terhal and vollbrecht  @xcite that the largest value of the fidelity @xmath175 is obtained if the schmidt bases @xmath176 , @xmath177 coincide with the computational basis . with this choice of bases ,",
    "the only remaining parameters are the schmidt coefficients @xmath178 , and @xmath179 we are interested in non - vanishing @xmath172 , therefore we can assume @xmath180 .",
    "further , we have the normalization @xmath181 since @xmath182 is monotonous , we can just minimize the product @xmath183 . by introducing lagrange multipliers @xmath56 and @xmath19 for the conditions above",
    ", we arrive at the equations @xmath184 we can use any two of the eqs .   to obtain @xmath185 which can be satisfied if @xmath186 or @xmath187 .",
    "now consider three coefficients @xmath178 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 such that @xmath190 and @xmath191 . from eq .",
    "we have @xmath192 and @xmath193 , so that the left - hand sides must agree , from which it follows that @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , there can be at most two different values for the @xmath195 , @xmath196 by inserting this into the conditions  , one obtains @xmath197 for given @xmath198 , those equations are solved by @xmath199 for @xmath200 and @xmath201 there is no general solution ; further , we see that it is sufficient to consider @xmath202 . we know from the axisymmetric states that @xmath203 ; what remains to do is to determine the @xmath198 and the sign for the best lower bound . to this end",
    ", we check the derivatives @xmath204 , @xmath205 and find that for the ` + ' sign both @xmath148 and @xmath125 have their minimum for maximum @xmath198 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath206 ( whereas the ` - ' sign gives @xmath207 ) .",
    "both solutions can be mapped to one another . by choosing the ` - ' sign and @xmath207",
    "we find eq .  , as well as the corresponding @xmath148 and @xmath125 .      in this section",
    "we prove the concavity of eq .  .",
    "we have @xmath208 where @xmath209 the last line here is obtained by substituting @xmath210 , @xmath211 , see eq .  .",

    "now we use the explicit expression for @xmath215 in eq .   to calculate the derivatives with respect to @xmath40 . after some algebra we find for the square bracket in eq .",

    "<S> the schmidt coefficients capture all entanglement properties of a pure bipartite state and therefore determine its usefulness for quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> while the quantification of the corresponding properties in mixed states is important both from a theoretical and a practical point of view , it is considerably more difficult , and methods beyond estimates for the concurrence are elusive . in particular </S>",
    "<S> this holds for a quantitative assessment of the most valuable resource , the forms of entanglement that can only exist in high - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a framework for lower bounding the appropriate measure of entanglement , the so - called _ g - concurrence _ </S>",
    "<S> , through few local measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that these bounds have relevant applications also for multipartite states .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the nature and operational uses of entanglement constitutes one of the key challenges of quantum information theory . while most algorithms that allow for a provable advantage with respect to classical computation exhibit this ubiquitous feature of quantum systems , it is not entirely clear whether it actually is required for the promising field of quantum computation and simulation to outperform their respective classical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> consequently much effort has been invested in understanding the interplay between entanglement structure and resource properties of multipartite quantum states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key results for computing with pure quantum states is the fact that , in order to go beyond the classical realm , a large dimension of entanglement is required while indeed any actual continuous measure of entanglement can be rather small  @xcite . whether or how this statement translates to realistic conditions , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , mixed - state quantum computing , is not at all clear . here </S>",
    "<S> one could imagine a speed - up without any entanglement present at all , or , on the contrary , the need for high - dimensional entanglement in a more robust sense . </S>",
    "<S> however , it appears intuitively clear that mixed states with substantial overlap to states , whose resource content is exponentially hard to simulate classically , continue to be sufficient .    to answer such questions and to ultimately gain a deeper insight into the very nature of entanglement one would need a thorough quantification of all possible features of mixed - state entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the sheer complexity of this task makes general solutions unlikely ( recall that even deciding whether or not a given state is entangled is an np - hard problem @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a first interesting step in this direction could be the quantitative characterization of high - dimensional entanglement , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the most expensive resource in bipartite systems . one of the paradigmatic measures for the dimensionality of entanglement is the schmidt number of mixed quantum states @xcite , for which various methods of certification exist  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the schmidt number in itself is not entirely significant , as even the highest possible dimensionality can lie in the vicinity of completely separable states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a robust quantification of mixed - state entanglement dimensionality can be made by using continuous measures of entanglement dimension which possibly bear also an operational meaning , beyond the question of mere computability . </S>",
    "<S> for bipartite entangled states the natural candidate for this purpose is the family of concurrence monotones introduced by gour  @xcite . for a @xmath0-dimensional system </S>",
    "<S> , there are @xmath1 such monotones @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3th concurrence monotone ( which we will call for short @xmath3-concurrence ) vanishes for a given state if its schmidt number does not exceed @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the usual concurrence  @xcite coincides with the 2-concurrence in this family ( up to a normalization constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measure for @xmath5 quantifies to which extent the maximum schmidt number is contained in a state and is usually termed @xmath6-concurrence . while there exist various bounds for the usual concurrence  @xcite , there are no mixed - state bounds for any of the other concurrences monotones , in particular not for the @xmath6-concurrence . </S>",
    "<S> such a bound would go beyond giving an answer to the question whether or not a state contains entanglement of maximum dimensionality .    </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly what we achieve in this article : we first derive a general method how this measure can be efficiently lower bounded by using nonlinear witness techniques , allowing for a mixed - state quantification of @xmath6-concurrence in an experimentally feasible way . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find the exact solution for the @xmath6-concurrence of the so - called axisymmetric states  @xcite , a highly symmetric two - parameter family of @xmath0 mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> this solution provides the basis for a simple method to find lower bounds to the @xmath6-concurrence of arbitrary mixed states . as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> , it also allows us to find lower bounds to the distance between the state of interest and the set of separable states , and , more generally , to any set of states with bounded schmidt number .    </S>",
    "<S> _ nonlinear g - concurrence witness._ we commence by a brief definition of the relevant concepts , before going to our first main theorem . for pure quantum states </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 , @xmath8 the @xmath6-concurrence is defined as the @xmath9th root of the product of the @xmath9 eigenvalues of the marginal  @xcite . denoting the schmidt coefficients of the state as @xmath10 ( _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath11 ; consequently the marginal eigenvalues are @xmath12 ) , we can define @xmath13 so that @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the extension to mixed states is straightforward via the convex roof  @xcite @xmath15 where the minimum is taken over all pure - state decompositions @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea here is to derive a tight lower bound for the @xmath6-concurrence of pure states in a form that admits a straightforward extension to a nonlinear witness lower bound for mixed states . in spirit this work follows refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , that is , if a state does _ not _ belong to a certain entanglement class , the modulus of the offdiagonal elements can not exceed a certain monotonically increasing function of the diagonal elements . using elementary algebra we arrive at our first main result ( the proof is given in the appendix ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the sum over all permutations of the levels of party @xmath19 , excluding the identical permutation . </S>",
    "<S> this general lower bound is both surprisingly simple and transparent . </S>",
    "<S> it is expressed via density matrix elements and requires the knowledge of only @xmath20 out of the @xmath21 elements . </S>",
    "<S> while eq .   is written in terms of @xmath0-dimensional systems , it is obvious that the bound can directly be applied also to the different bipartitions of multipartite systems , as we will see in the example below . before we proceed with a more detailed discussion let us briefly comment that the bound ( [ lowbound1 ] ) is tight at least for all maximally entangled states of dimension @xmath9 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> . + by investigating the noise resistance we find that the worst possible kind of noise for our bound is white noise , as it maximally affects the negative terms in the bound . for dimension @xmath24 , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , we can study the white - noise tolerance by considering the state @xmath25 . inserting this state into our bound </S>",
    "<S> we find that it can reveal the presence of @xmath26-concurrence down to @xmath27 ( which is close to the exact value @xmath28 , see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for higher dimensions the noise resistance of the @xmath6-concurrence decreases rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> possibly the quality of the bound   can be improved by finding different estimates of the @xmath6-concurrence for pure states . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the nonlinear witness eq .   is not the only possibility to estimate the quality of high - dimensional entanglement in a mixed bipartite state . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we first describe the exact solution of @xmath29 for certain symmetric states . by means of this solution </S>",
    "<S> we can achieve an independent lower bound for arbitrary @xmath0 states . </S>",
    "<S> _ exact solution for axisymmetric states._ families of highly symmetric states often allow for an exact solution of entanglement - related problems  @xcite . here </S>",

    "<S> then , the following inequality holds  @xcite : @xmath80 this inequality tells us that , given @xmath61 , whenever its projection @xmath79 lies at a finite distance with respect to the closest axisymmetric state with schmidt number @xmath3 , we know that the distance between @xmath61 and the closest schmidt number @xmath3 state is at least as large . </S>",

    "<S> this shows that the developed methods are suitable also to provide a quantitative analysis of recent efforts at producing high - dimensionally entangled states in the lab . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that schmidt numbers equal to the system dimension were certified e.g. in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite implies that the respective @xmath6-concurrence will be nonzero and the data taken should suffice to apply our methods . due to the possibility of sl(@xmath70 optimization </S>",
    "<S> , entanglement detection through our approach is superior compared to merely using an optimal schmidt number witness . </S>",
    "<S> however , exploiting this possibility requires complete knowledge of the state parameters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have outlined how our methods can be applied also in the investigation of multipartite entanglement . we have shown that the resource of maximum schmidt number across the bipartitions of @xmath94-qubit cluster states is exponentially fragile with respect to the admixture of white noise . </S>",
