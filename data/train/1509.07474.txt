    "the launch of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope in june 2008 marked a new era in @xmath0-ray astronomy , thanks to the unprecedented performance of its large area telescope ( lat ; atwood et al .",
    "the recently released third _",
    "fermi_-lat @xmath0-ray source catalogue ( 3fgl ; acero et al .",
    "2015 ) derived from the first 4 years of observations contains 3033 sources .",
    "about 70% of these sources have been either directly identified , e.g. either from the detection of @xmath0-ray pulsations ( pulsars ) or correlated @xmath0-ray and optical / radio variability ( active galactic nuclei , novae , x - ray binaries ) , or associated with objects that are either known or potential @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "the remaining 30% of the 3fgl sources have not been associated with any object yet , hence they are referred to as _ unassociated _ , and their nature is unknown .",
    "being pulsars the largest family of @xmath0-ray sources identified in the galaxy ( @xmath9 and counting ) , a significant fraction of the unassociated _",
    "fermi_-lat sources might be @xmath0-ray pulsars . some of them might have no or extremely faint radio emission , and escaped detection in all radio pulsar surveys so far .",
    "indeed , many of such radio - quiet ( rq ) , or radio faint ( rf ) , @xmath0-ray pulsars have been discovered through blind periodicity searches in the @xmath0-ray data ( e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "2009 ) thanks to the use of novel search techniques ( e.g. , atwood et al .  2006 ; pletsch et al .",
    "2013 ) . about 45% of the @xmath0-ray pulsars discovered by the _",
    "fermi_-lat are milli - second pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "interestingly , the vast majority of these msps ( @xmath10 80% ) are in binary systems . some of them have an he white dwarf ( wd ) companion star of mass @xmath11 , whereas others have a usually non - degenerate companion ( a late main sequence star or a brown dwarf ) which is ablated by irradiation from the pulsar wind .",
    "two distinct families of binary msps are recognized depending on the degree of the ablation processes : the black widow ( bw ) msps , where the companion is a very low - mass star of @xmath12 almost fully ablated by the pulsar wind , and the redback ( rb ) msps , where the companion is only partially ablated and has an higher mass of @xmath13@xmath14 ( roberts 2013 ) .",
    "the use of automatic classification codes ( e.g. , ackermann et al .  2012 ; lee et al .  2012 ; mirabal et al .  2012 ) based on the @xmath0-ray characteristics is crucial to single out pulsar candidates among the many unassociated _",

    "fermi_-lat sources are still key to confirm the proposed pulsar classifications , though .",
    "in particular , optical observations are an important aid in the search for binary msps , for which blind periodicity searches in @xmath0 rays must account for the unknown orbital parameters , requiring a massive use of super - computing power facilities ( pletsch & clark 2014 ) .",
    "indeed , optical observations yielded the identification of the two _ fermi_-lat sources 2fgl j2339.7@xmath10531 and 2fgl j1311.7@xmath13429 as binary msps prior to the detection of radio or @xmath0-ray pulsations ( ray et al . in preparation ; pletsch et al .",

    "2013 ; salvetti et al .",
    ", in preparation ) confirms that 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618   is a very likely pulsar candidate and suggests that it is , most probably , an msp , either isolated or in a binary system ( see section  [ ann ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath16 of the msps detected by the _",
    "fermi_-lat are in binary systems , one can expect that would be a binary msp .",
    "we investigated this scenario through a multi - wavelength observation campaign ( x rays , ultraviolet , optical , infrared ) of 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  carried out using both dedicated observations and exploiting data available in public archives .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section 2 and the results are presented in section 3 .",
    "discussion and conclusion follow in section 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "recently , we developed an advanced classification code ( salvetti et al .",
    "2013 ) that can recognise different classes of @xmath0-ray pulsars , e.g. young / middle - aged pulsars and msps .",
    "this code uses a statistical predictive method based on artificial neural network ( ann ) techniques to quantify the probability of a given source to be msp - like on the basis of its @xmath0-ray temporal and spectral characteristics .",
    "the method is based on an advanced hierarchical ann architecture consisting of simple neural networks applied in sequence to discriminate pulsar - like from agn - like objects in first place and disentangle msps from young / middle age pulsars in second place .",
    "such a method correctly classifies 84% of the identified msps , while the false positive fraction is lower than 10% ( salvetti et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we then applied the optimized hierarchical neural network to all _ unassociated _ 3fgl sources , to rank them according to their msp probability function . as a result ,",
    "3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  was classified as a msp - like object with a probability greater than 99% .",
    "therefore , it stands out as an obvious candidate for multi - wavelength investigations .",
    "we carried out an _ xmm - newton _  observation of the 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  @xmath0-ray error box ( programme i d : 0720750301 ) , which started on 2013 october 10 at 09:43:18 ut ( revolution 2534 ) and lasted 44.6 ks .",
    "the pn detector ( struder et al .",
    "2001 ) of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) instrument was operated in extended full frame mode , with a time resolution of 200 ms over a @xmath17 field - of - view ( fov ) , while the metal oxide semi - conductor ( mos ) detectors ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) were set in full frame mode ( 2.6 s time resolution on a 15@xmath18 radius fov ) .",
    "the thin optical filter was used for the pn while a medium one was used for the mos cameras .",
    "we retrieved the observation data files ( odf ) from the _ xmm - newton _  science archive and used the most recent release of the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis software ( sas ) v14.0 to analyze them .",
    "we performed a standard data processing , using the epproc and emproc tools , and screening for high particle background time intervals ( e.g. , de luca et al .",
    "our analysis revealed no significant contamination from soft protons .",
    "after the standard data processing , the good , dead - time corrected exposure time was 41.6 ks for the pn and 43.2 ks for the two mos detectors .      in the optical / near - infrared ( near - ir ) , we observed the 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  field with the gamma - ray burst optical / near - infrared detector ( grond ; greiner et al .",

    "the observations were executed in grey time with airmass between 1.12 and 1.28 and mean seeing of 1.0 .",
    "single dithered exposures were reduced ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , distortion correction ) and stacked using standard iraf tasks implemented in the grond pipeline ( krhler et al .",
    "2008 ; yoldas et al .",
    "the astrometry calibration was computed on single exposures against stars selected from the usno - b1.0 catalogue ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) in the optical bands and the 2mass catalogue ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) in the near - ir bands , yielding an accuracy of 03 with respect to the chosen reference frame .",
    "the photometric calibration in the optical was computed against a close - by field from the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",

    "the photometric calibration was computed against 2mass stars identified in the grond field of view .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute photometry calibration was 0.02 magnitudes in the g@xmath19 , r@xmath19 , i@xmath19 , z@xmath19 bands , 0.03 magnitudes in j and h , and 0.05 in the k@xmath20 band .",
    "in addition to grond , we used serendipitous jhk@xmath22 images of the 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  field taken on july 16 and 25 2010 with the near - ir camera ( vircam ; dalton et al .",

    "spectra with very low counts were fitted after fixing the @xmath33 to the estimated value along the line of sight ( @xmath35 @xmath5 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) , or fixing either the photon index or the temperature to typical values , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 kev or @xmath38 kev in case of an ap and a bb model , respectively .    as shown in table  [ tab1 ] ,",
    "only source 3 and 11 , the two brightest x - ray sources in our sample , were best fitted by a simple pl model , with a @xmath39=52.32 ( 42 degrees of freedom , d.o.f . ) for the former and @xmath39=16.06 ( 22 d.o.f . ) for the latter . for the remaining 13 sources ,",

    "figure  [ spec_src3 ] shows the binned spectrum of source 3 extracted simultaneously from each of the epic detectors , together with the best - fit pl model .",
    "since most msps are characterized by a significant thermal component to their x - ray spectra , we tried to fit the spectra of source 3 and source 11 with an absorbed bb plus pl model .",
    "this improved the accuracy of the fit only for source 3 , with a @xmath39=34.9 ( 40 d.o.f . ) . from the f - test ( bevington 1969 ) , we computed a 0.0003 probability that adding a thermal component to the model would produce a chance improvement to the fit . since this probability corresponds to a @xmath103.6@xmath41 significance only , hereafter we ignored the absorbed bb plus pl spectral model . since for most x - ray sources",
    "the measured counts are too few to clearly discriminate among different spectral models , we checked whether we could extract qualitative spectral information from an hardness ratio ( hr ) analysis ( marelli et al .",
    "however , we found that the observed hrs are compatible with different spectral models and , therefore , are not constraining .      in order to detect possible time variability during the _ xmm - newton _  observation",
    ", we generated standard light curves from the pn - data for all the 16 x - ray sources in table 1 .",
    "starting from the source and background regions described in section  [ spectra ] , we extracted source+background and background light curves , respectively , with the sas task evselect and combined them into a background - subtracted light curve with the task epiclccorr .",
    "this task also corrects the time series for vignetting , bad pixels , chip gaps , quantum efficiency , dead time , exposure and good time intervals . for each source we generated a light curve with time binning of 2500 s , or multiple of this value , to have at least 25 counts per bin and we ran a @xmath39 test to evaluate the variability significance . only source 3",
    "is characterized by a significant variability during the observation ( @xmath42 , with 16 d.o.f . ) , with a chance probability of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . after combining the data from all the three epic cameras the source 3 light curve shows a more apparent variability ( figure  [ lc_src3 ] , left ) , with a chance probability of @xmath45 , whereas the other x - ray still show no evidence of significant variability .",
    "the source 3 light curve also hints at a possibly periodic modulation .",
    "we converted photon arrival times to the solar system barycentric dynamical time ( tbd ) with the sas task barycen and used the ftool task efsearch to find the best period in the light curve through a maximum @xmath39 test .",
    "we folded the light curve with periods ranging from 100 to 43000 s , the latter comparable to the length of the _ xmm - newton _  observation .",
    "we found the best - fit period at 0.2245@xmath20.0081 d , where the period uncertainty was obtained following leahy ( 1987 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath39 of 104.5 ( 9 d.o.f . ) gives a chance probability of @xmath46 , accounting for the number of trials , and makes the periodicity statistically significant ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the presence of a periodic signal at the corresponding frequency of @xmath48 hz was independently confirmed by the power spectrum produced with the ftool powspec .",
    "we note that the best - fit x - ray period of source 3 is comparable to about half the length of the _ xmm - newton _  observation , so that the observed periodicity might be spurious . we examined the light curves of other comparably bright x - ray sources detected in the whole _",
    "xmm - newton _  fov and found that none of them showed evidence of periodicity at any time scales . nonetheless , the fact that the length of the _ xmm - newton _  observation only covers @xmath10 2.3 cycles , prevents us to firmly claim that source 3 is periodic . the x - ray light curve folded at the best - fit period ( figure  [ lc_src3 ] ,",
    "right ) is characterised by two peaks separated in phase by 0.31@xmath20.04 .",
    "therefore , it can not be described by a simple sinusoidal or gaussian model , with a null hypothesis probability lower than @xmath49 .",
    "we checked whether the folded x - ray light curve of source 3 varied as a function of the energy and whether the x - ray spectrum changed as a function of the phase . in both cases , however , the available statistics is not sufficient to highlight significant differences in the energy - resolved light curves and the phase - resolved spectra .",
    "we looked for archival x - ray images of the 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  field to check for long - term variability of source 3 .",
    "the field was serendipitously observed with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) of _ suzaku _ ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) on october 28 , 2010 for a total exposure time of 21.5 ks ( obsid 705028010 ) .",
    "we extracted source counts from a circle of radius 13 around the best _ xmm - newton _  coordinates of source 3 and background counts from a nearby , source - free 2-radius circle using the heasoft(v.6.16 ) tool xselect and summed the spectra from all the xis cameras with the mathpha , addarf and addrmf tools .",
    "we obtained 350 counts , of which @xmath1050% are from the source . a fit with a pl",
    "gives a null hypothesis probability of 0.06 ( 4 d.o.f . ) , with @xmath50 @xmath5 ( 90% upper limit ) , photon index @xmath51=1.3@xmath20.4 and an unabsorbed flux in the 0.310 kev energy range of 1.7@xmath52 @xmath53 erg @xmath5 s@xmath7 , fully compatible with the _ xmm - newton _  results .",

    "( 2013 ) , taken in 2010 and 2011 .",

    "this modulation is also seen in the r@xmath19 , i@xmath19 , and z@xmath19 light curves , with both shape and amplitudes similar to the g@xmath19 one , and is also recognised in the j and h - band light curves , and very marginally in the k - band one .",
    "this suggests that the observed modulation is real and not due , for instance , to possible problems with the photometry in a given filter . as a check , for all filters we extracted the light curves of several stars of comparable brightness detected in the grond fov but found no evidence of such a modulation",
    "this confirms that it is not due to random effects , such as variations in the sky conditions ( transparency , background , moon illumination ) , or systematic effects , such as variations in the encircled flux due to the fixed size of the photometry aperture with respect to the seeing disk .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the modulation seems to be periodic argues against the possibility that it is produced by any of such effects and implies that is associated with an intrinsic star variability .",

    "the x - ray light curve of source 3 can be explained assuming a binary msp scenario , the emission from the intrabinary shock is expected to be modulated at the orbital period .",
    "recent studies suggest that the x - ray modulation may be due to synchrotron beaming , doppler boosting of the flow within the shock , or obscuration by the companion ( bogdanov et al .",

    "the optical emission in bws and rbs is dominated by the non - degenerate companion and is characterized by significant luminosity and colour variations .",
    "the optical light curve profile can bring the signature of two different effects : the tidal distortion of the companion star surface , due to the gravitational pull of the msp , and the heating of the companion star surface , due to irradiation of relativistic photons and/or high energy particles from the msp ( breton et al .",

    "standard models for the rb optical light curves based on tidal distortion and pulsar irradiation ( e.g. , thorstensen & armstrong 2005 ) can not fit well neither the asymmetric peaks nor the peak separation .",

    "if we interpret this periodicity as the orbital period of a compact binary system , source 3 would probably be a binary msp and , as such , a very likely counterpart to 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618 .",
    "in particular , both the optical colors of its putative companion star and the optical light curve profile , with two asymmetric peaks separated in phase by @xmath64 , suggest that source 3/3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618  is a rb .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the lack of apparent radio emission , which would be explained by eclipse of the radio signal as it propagates through the evaporated atmosphere of the irradiated msp companion , as observed in many rbs .",
    "optical spectroscopy observations of source 3 will be essential to obtain a more accurate classification of its companion star and measure its radial velocity curve , crucial to confirm the binary msp scenario and determine the orbital parameters of the binary system .",
    "a precise determination of the orbital parameters is necessary to fold @xmath0-ray photons and search for the msp pulsations .",
    "a timing solution , that can be extended back in time to the launch of _ fermi _ in 2008 , will provide even tighter constraints on the orbital parameters and their evolution .",
