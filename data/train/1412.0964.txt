    "kurtz @xcite showed , for a general class of population models , weak convergence of the stochastic model to the corresponding deterministic model as the system size , @xmath1 , tends to infinity .",
    "further , in @xcite kurtz provided a central limit theorem - type result that explored the nature of this convergence in more detail , revealing a diffusion process behavior .",
    "these limiting results have been used to justify the use of the multivariate normal approximation introduced by @xcite to close moment equations for nonlinear population models .",
    "use of this approach ( e.g. @xcite ) allows one to assess the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations likely to be seen about the deterministic solution and hence determine the adequacy of a deterministic description .",
    "many epidemic processes , however , have an explicit time dependence @xcite . for instance , an infectious agent may be more transmissible at certain times of the year than at others",
    ". several biological and social mechanisms can give rise to such seasonality , including sensitivity of certain viruses to humidity and congregation of children during school sessions .",
    "in this study , we extend the results of kurtz to epidemic processes that include explicit time dependence , specifically where the transmission parameter , @xmath0 , carries a time dependency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the model .",
