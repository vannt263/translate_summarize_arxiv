    "the range of the forward scattering strength for which in our calculation a nematic phase is only observed for fields in @xmath89-direction is not very large .",
    "note , however , that the nematic phase only appears in a very narrow region ( @xmath186@xcite ) and thus , @xmath35 is only slightly bigger than @xmath187 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - h ] where the dependence of the critical fields on the forward scattering strength is shown .",
    "the width of the nematic phase grows rather rapidly with increasing @xmath35 .",

    "+ obviously , not only the strength of the soc , but also the nesting properties of the spin - polarized fermi surfaces play an important role for the appearance of the anisotropy effect .",
    "nesting properties are a factor of tuning our model to the vicinity of a sdw instability . to analyze the impact of enhanced sdw correlations , we consider two different electron densities and corresponding on - site interaction strengths @xmath141 with @xmath188const ( see crosses in the left part of fig.6 ) .",
    "this allows us to examine the cases of two different proximities to a sdw instability with comparable strengths of fm correlations .",
    "one important finding is that the stronger the sdw correlations the more pronounced the anisotropy effect and thus , the smaller the ratio @xmath189 becomes.this is depicted in fig .",
    "14 . in fig .",
    "6 we also show that the ferromagnetic and sdw instabilities can be competing for the chosen parameter range .",
    "we fix our model parameters in a way to avoid the occurrence of a staggered magnetic moment for any value of the magnetic field along the z - axis , while the staggered moment is field induced for in - plane fields .",
    "+ we should also comment on the strength of the soc @xmath155 that we expect for this system . to get an estimate of the on - site soc strength @xmath190 for p - electrons on the oxygen , we take the o@xmath191 vacuum value , @xmath192mev . a very crude estimate of the staggered soc coupling from eq",

    "[ fig : nemz - nemxy ] and [ fig : g - h ] , this would allow for a nematic phase with a width of @xmath197 , in agreement with experiment . for a more reliable estimate of @xmath155 , dft calculations should be performed .",
    "+ finally , some remarks to the nematic phase are in order .",
    "as was already mentioned , the nematic phase introduced here is the same as discussed by other authors .",

    ", no nematic phase is entered , but the system undergoes a single metamagnetic transition connected to the proximity to the ferromagnetic instability as discussed above . above @xmath198 ,",
    "the system enters a nematic phase whose region grows with increasing @xmath35 . here , @xmath128 .",
    "]    to conclude , we showed that the rotated oxygen octahedra lead to a staggered hopping that can be described with the help of a ( staggered ) spin - orbit coupling of rashba - type .",
    "this introduces an anisotropy of the response to a magnetic field , namely an induced spin - density wave for the case of in - plane fields .",
    "this staggered magnetization could be observed in neutron scattering experiments . to our knowledge",
    "this kind of experiment has not been performed so far .",
    "the additional magnetization has , first , the effect that the critical field for a metamagnetic transition is shifted to lower values for in - plane fields .",
    "also , the critical temperature @xmath199 up to which the transition is first order is higher for fields in the @xmath200-plane .",
    "last and most important , the spin - density wave opens gaps at the fermi level that lead to an anisotropy for the appearance of a nematic phase . additionally considering spin - orbit coupling effects of",
    "the ru orbital would account for the full anisotropy of @xmath3 ( @xmath35-tensor anisotropy ) .",
    "therefore , the present work allows for a picture that is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations including the anisotropies in @xmath3 , @xmath199 and the appearance of a nematic phase .",
