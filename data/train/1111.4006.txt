    "this type of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlation @xcite , has been used as a resource for fundamental studies of quantum mechanics @xcite , for quantum imaging @xcite , and experiments of quantum information @xcite .",
    "the process of spdc has been studied extensively in the past @xcite , and much of the recent effort has been put in the quantification of the spatial entanglement for a given experimental geometry .",
    "traditionally , this has been done through the technique of schmidt decomposition of the two - photon wave function , which gives the schmidt number , @xmath2 , and the schmidt modes allowed for each photon @xcite .",
    "while this approach describes important properties of the spatial correlation , it basically gives no information of the form of the spatial joint distributions , therefore giving no information about the gaussianity of the spatial two - photon state of spdc .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the state of the down - converted photons depends on the phase - matching conditions .",
    "nevertheless , due to its complex structure , the phase - matching functions are usually approximated by gaussian functions @xcite .",
    "while the approach being adopted seems to be reasonable , it has already been shown that fine ( new ) structures in the spatial distributions of these photons can be observed due to ( the manipulation of ) the phase - matching conditions @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the non - gaussianity of the spatial two - photon state of spdc by properly taking into account the phase - matching conditions .",
    "we start by showing how the variances of the near- and far - field conditional probability distributions are affected by the phase - matching functions .",
    "then , we analyze the role of the epr - criterion @xcite regarding the non - gaussianity and entanglement detection of this state .",
    "even though it has been demonstrated that higher order separability criteria can be used for the entanglement detection of spatial non - gaussian entangled states @xcite , we show that a proper consideration of the phase - matching function reveals , precisely , when the _ simpler _ epr - criterion can still be used for the spatial entanglement detection .",
    "we also show that ( and when ) the epr - criterion can be used as a witness for the non - gaussianity of this state .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a statistical measure , based on the _ negentropy _ @xcite of the near- and far - field joint distributions , which allows for the quantification of the non - gaussianity of the spatial two - photon state of spdc .",
    "this measure does not correspond to a quantum mechanical generalization of the negentropy , such as the non - gaussianity measure based on the quantum relative entropy ( qre ) @xcite , and so does not require the knowledge of the full density matrix .",
    "only the moments associated with the diagonal sub - matrices of the covariance matrix need to be measured .",
    "thus , it is experimentally more accessible @xcite .",
    "moreover , for most of the configurations used so far , we show that its value can be estimated from the ( easier to measure ) marginal and conditional distributions .",
    "we also demonstrate that it has common properties with previous introduced measures of non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "the quantification of the non - gaussianity of a quantum state has important applications for quantum information @xcite , and thus the practicality our measure shall be relevant for new applications of the spatial correlations of spdc in this field .",

    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 functions arise from the phase - matching conditions , and due to the difficulty of dealing analytically with them , they are usually approximated by gaussian functions .",
    "the approach that has been adopted consists in approximating the function @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "sometimes it is used that @xmath20 @xcite , and in other cases the value of @xmath21 is chosen such that both functions coincide at @xmath22 @xcite or at @xmath23 @xcite of their peak .",
    "while this approximation seems to be reasonable for the entanglement quantification @xcite , there has been no investigation to determine how precise it is for describing the distribution of the momentum correlations . besides",
    ", it should be noticed that once a gaussian approximation is adopted for the @xmath16 function , the corresponding approximation for the @xmath17 function is already defined by the fourier transform .",

    "there is no loss of generalization if we work in one dimension ( i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) . to simplify our analysis",

    "the near and far - field conditional probabilities can be used for implementing the epr - paradox @xcite .",
    "this is done by observing the violation of the inequality @xmath60 , which certifies the quantum nature of the spatial correlations of the down - converted photons .",
    "since we have determined how the phase - matching function affects the variances @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we can also look for its effect on the epr - criterion .",

    "the conditional variances are independent of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 values @xcite .",
    "whenever @xmath34 increases , the variances become dependent on @xmath63 and @xmath64 . nevertheless for smaller values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which are of most experimental relevance , the red ( solid )",
    "curve shown in figure [ fig2 ] captures the overall behavior of the product of @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the state of eq  ( [ estmon ] ) .",
    "as we can see , for values of @xmath34 smaller than @xmath65 or greater than @xmath66 , the epr - criterion can safely be used for detecting the spatial entanglement of the two - photon state of spdc .    besides of being useful as a entanglement witness , the epr - criterion can also be used as a witness for the non - gaussianity of the spatial state of spdc .",
    "this emphasizes another application for this criterion , which has been related already with other quantum information tasks @xcite . to observe this",

    "from our previous analysis it is clear that the spatial state of spdc can not be seen as a two - mode gaussian entangled state , even when it is generated with a gaussian pump beam and in the case of perfect phase - matching .",
    "we now proceed to quantifying the non - gaussianity of this state .",
    "first , we introduce the concept of _ negentropy _ which is the base of our approach @xcite .",
    "the negentropy of a probability density function @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74-h[p(\\xi_1,\\xi_2)],$ ] where @xmath75 is a gaussian distribution with the same expected values and covariance matrix of @xmath73 .",

    "the advantage of using negentropy is that it can be seen as the optimal estimator of non - gaussianity , as far as density probabilities are involved .",
    "this is due to the properties that it is always non - negative , and that it is zero only for gaussian distributions . besides , it is invariant under invertible linear transformations @xcite .    motivated by these properties we define the total non - gaussianity of the spatial two - photon state of spdc as @xmath77 + n[p_{nf}^s({\\tilde{x}}_1,{\\tilde{x}}_2)],\\ ] ] where @xmath78 $ ] and @xmath79 $ ] are the negentropies of the far- and near - field joint distributions of eq .",

    "the calculations performed for these negentropies can be adapted for different experimental geometries , or used for the proper determination of other quantum information quantities related with the differential entropy of the spatial joint distributions @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath84 , emphasizes that spatial gaussian approximations should be taken carefully due to the _ extremality _ of gaussian states @xcite . for comparison purposes , we calculated in appendix [ suplementoe ] the value of @xmath85 , which is the measure of non - gaussianity based on the qre @xcite .",
