    "object detection and photometry are performed using the double image mode of sextractor version 2.5.0 .",
    "for source detection , we use smoothed @xmath32 images with gaussian kernels to match their seeing to a fwhm of @xmath36 arcsec in order to slightly increase the sensitivities for diffuse extended sources and to make all the images the same seeing size .",
    "we use the same detection threshold ( detect - thresh ) of @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 @xmath8 arcsec@xmath9 ( or 28.5 mag arcsec@xmath9 ) for all the 12 fields .",
    "the magnitudes and colours are measured with isophotal apertures defined in the @xmath32 images .            in fig .  1",
    ", we plot the @xmath37 colours and @xmath32 magnitudes of the @xmath32-detected sources .",
    "the solid line represents the colour criterion used for narrow - band excess objects , @xmath38 , which corresponds to an observed equivalent width of @xmath39  . from these narrow - band excess objects ,",
    "we make a diameter - limited catalog of 14 labs down to a major - axis diameter of the isophotal aperture of @xmath40 arcsec ( or @xmath41 kpc at @xmath42 ) .    for the lab selection",
    ", we use the major - axis diameters rather than isophotal area , in order to cover labs with asymmetric structures .",
    "for example , cold stream models predicted that labs have asymmetric , long and thin filaments @xcite .",
    "an alternative quantity for the lab selection may be ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "however , the ly@xmath0 luminosity could be dominated by a bright central core , such as starbursts in the central galaxy and agn .",
    "six out of the 14 labs have been spectroscopically confirmed by previous surveys @xcite . for two new labs",
    ", we carried out spectroscopic follow - up observations with magellan / imacs in june 2009 , and identified ly@xmath0 emission from these labs ( see ono et al . in prep for more details ) .",
    "the properties of the 14 giant labs are listed in table  2 .",
    "we rename the labs in the new sample since initial surveys .",
    "ssa22-sb1-lab16 was named as lab18 in @xcite .",
    "note that ssa22-sb1-lab1 discovered by @xcite is still the largest one in this sample .",
    "ssa22-sb3-lab1 , and goods - n - lab1 are associated with qsos @xcite .",
    "we apply the `` qso '' labels only to optically bright known qsos but some of the other labs have potential signs of obscured agn .",
    "all the 5 labs from the initial surveys @xcite were detected at x - ray , 8@xmath43 m , and/or submm wavelength follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "thus , although there are only two labs are apparently associated with qsos , the agn fraction of the 14 labs may be higher when accounting for more obscured agn .",
    "the thumbnail images ( @xmath44 arcsec@xmath45 ) of the 14 giant labs are displayed in fig .",
    "the labs show a wide variety of ly@xmath0 morphologies . while some labs appear to have circular shapes , some have filamentary ( or elongated ) shapes .",
    "we quantify the ly@xmath0 morphology by defining \" filamentarity  , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the major - axis diameter .",
    "for example , a circle has @xmath13 and an extremely thin filament has @xmath14 .",
    "the filamentarities of the labs range @xmath48 .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties of the ly@xmath0 properties by putting the thumbnail @xmath32 images of each lab at 100 random positions on the original @xmath32 images and measuring the deviations .",
    "3 shows the spatial distributions of the 14 giant labs and smoothed density maps of @xmath49 ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) selected by yamada et al .",
    "( in prep ) with the same data .",
    "since some bright ly@xmath0 knots in the giant labs are also detected as single or multiple laes , we exclude such laes from the lae sample in this analysis .",
    "we make the density maps by smoothing the lae spatial distributions with a gaussian kernel of @xmath50 arcmin , or fwhm @xmath51 comoving mpc .",
    "the smoothing kernel size is chosen to match the median distance between the nearest neighbours in the lae samples in the blank fields ( sxds , goods - n , and sdf ) .",
    "the contours represent lae overdensities , @xmath520 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , where @xmath53 is the mean lae number density in the blank fields .     uncertainties .",
    "the filamentarity of the labs shows a weak anti - correlation with the overdensity of laes . ]    in fig .  4",
    ", we plot the filamentarities of the 14 labs as a function of the lae overdensities .",
    "the filamentarity shows a weak anti - correlation with the lae overdensity .",
    "while more filamentary labs reside in average density environments , more circular labs reside in both average density and overdense environments .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is @xmath54 .",
    "we can rule out random distributions with @xmath55 confidence .",
    "we have confirmed that the results do not change significantly if we use isophotal area for the lab selection , suggesting that the correlation is not due to the selection method .",
    "based on deep , wide - field ly@xmath0 imaging , we construct a sample of 14 giant lab candidates at @xmath42 from a volume of @xmath4 comoving mpc@xmath5 . this is the largest sample of giant labs and triples the number of known labs over 100 kpc .",
    "our giant lab sample shows a wide variety of ly@xmath0 morphologies and resides not only in overdense environments , as derived from laes , but also in lower dense environments .",
    "we find a possible hint for `` morphology - density '' relation of the labs : the ly@xmath0 filamentarity seems to differ as a function of the local density environments .",
    "how can we interpret this possible morphology - density relation of the labs ?",
    "the ly@xmath0 morphology may relate to the formation mechanisms of labs . according to recent numerical simulations",
    ", more filamentary labs may be good candidates for cold gas accretion from the surrounding igm @xcite . although direct evidence for such gas inflows is not found around star - forming galaxies at @xmath56 @xcite ,",
    "recent studies of the metallicity of star - forming galaxies from low- to high - redshifts indicate that gas inflows may still be dominant in the field environment at @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "more circular labs may relate to large - scale gas outflows , which are driven by intense starbursts and/or agn activities @xcite . at high - redshift ,",
    "star - formation and agn activities in overdense environments are known to be several times higher than those in the field environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "future spectroscopic and multi - wavelength follow - up observations would enable us to investigate the gas dynamics and the variations of the star - formation and agn activities in giant labs as a function of the environments and to test the interpretations .",
