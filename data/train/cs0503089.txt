    "researchers believe that any sufficiently compressed data approaches a uniform random number . this conjecture is called folklore for source coding ( han @xcite ) . the main reason for this conjecture seems to be the fact that the optimal limits of both rates coincide with the entropy rate : that is , the optimal compression length equals the optimal length of intrinsic randomness ( uniform random number generation ) in the asymptotic first order .",
    "there is , however , no research comparing them in the asymptotic second order even though some researchers treat the second order asymptotics for variable - length source coding @xcite . in this paper , taking account of the asymptotic second order , we compare them in the case of the general information source in the fixed - length setting .",
    "especially , we show by application to the case of the independent and identical distribution ( i.i.d . ) , that the size of compression is greater than the one of intrinsic randomness with respect to the asymptotic second order .",
    "this fact implies that data generated by the fixed - length source coding is not a uniform random number .",
    "details of the above discussion are as follows .",
    "the size of generated data is one of the main points in data compression and intrinsic randomness . in the asymptotic",
    "setting , by approximating the size @xmath0 as @xmath1 , we usually focus on the exponential component ( exponent ) @xmath2 .",
    "smaller size is better in data compression , but larger size is better in intrinsic randomness . both optimal exponents @xmath2 coincide .",
    "however , as will be shown in this paper , the size @xmath0 can be approximated as @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we call the issue concerning the coefficient @xmath2 of @xmath4 the first order asymptotics , and the issue concerning the coefficient @xmath5 of @xmath6 the second order asymptotics .",
    "when the information source is the independent and identical distribution @xmath7 of a probability distribution @xmath8 , the optimal first coefficient is the entropy @xmath9 in both settings . in this paper",
    ", we treat the optimization of the second coefficient @xmath5 for general information sources . in particular , we treat intrinsic randomness by using half of the variational distance .",
    "these two coefficients do not coincide with each other in many cases .",
    "in particular , these optimal second order coefficients depend on the allowable error even in the i.i.d .",
    "( conversely , it is known that these optimal first order coefficients are independent of the allowable error in the i.i.d .",
    "case when the allowable error is constant . )",
    "if the allowable error is less than @xmath10 , the optimal second order coefficient for source coding is strictly larger than the one for intrinsic randomness . as a consequence , when the constraint error for source coding is sufficiently small",
    ", the compressed random number is different from the uniform random number .",
    "hence , there exists a trade - off relation between the error of compression and the error of intrinsic randomness .",
    "however , han @xcite showed that the compressed data achieving the optimal rate is ` almost ' uniform random at least in the i.i.d .",
    "case in the fixed - length compression .",
    "et al._@xcite and han & uchida @xcite also treated a similar problem in the variable - length setting .",
    "one may think that han s result contradicts our result , but there is no contradiction .",
    "this is because han s error criterion between the obtained distribution and the true uniform distribution is based on normalized kl - divergence ( [ eq68 ] ) , and is not as restrictive as our criterion .",
    "thus , the distribution of the compressed data may not be different from the uniform distribution under our criterion even if it is ` almost ' the uniform distribution under his criterion .",
    "indeed , han @xcite has already stated in his conclusion that if we adopt the variational distance , the compressed data is different from the uniform random number in the case of the stationary ergodic source . however , in this paper , using the results of second order asymptotics , we succeeded in deriving the tight trade - off relation between the variational distance from the uniform distribution and decoding error probability of the fixed - length compression in the asymptotic setting .",
    "further , when we adopt kl - divergence divided by @xmath6 instead of normalized kl - divergence , the compressed data is different from the uniform random number .",
    "hence , the speed of convergence of normalized kl - divergence to @xmath11 is essential .    in this paper",
    ", we use the information spectrum method mainly formulated by han@xcite .",
    "we treat the general information source , which is the general sequence @xmath12 of probability distributions without structure .",
    "this method enables us to characterize the asymptotic performance only with the random variable @xmath13 ( the logarithm of likelihood ) without any further assumption . in order to treat the i.i.d",
    ".  case based on the above general result , it is sufficient to calculate the asymptotic behavior of the random variable @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the information spectrum method leads us to treat the second order asymptotics in a manner parallel to the first order asymptotics , whose large part is known .",
    "that is , if we can suitably formulate theorems in the second order asymptotics and establish an appropriate relation between the first order asymptotics and the second order asymptotics , we can easily extend proofs concerning the first order asymptotics to those of the second order asymptotics . this is because the technique used in the information spectrum method is quite universal .",
    "thus , the discussion of the first order asymptotics plays an important role in our proof of some important theorems in the second order asymptotics .",
    "therefore , we give proofs of some theorems in the first order asymptotics even though they are known .",
    "this treatment produces short proofs of main theorems for the second order asymptotics with reference to the corresponding proofs on the first order asymptotics .    while we referred the i.i.d .",
    "case in the above discussion , the markovian case also has a similar asymptotic structure .",
    "that is , the limiting distribution of the logarithm of likelihood is equal to normal distribution .",
    "hence , we have the same conclusion concerning folklore for source coding in the markovian case . moreover , we construct a fixed - length source code that attains the optimal rate up to the second order asymptotics , _",
    "i.e. _ , a universal fixed - length source code .",
    "we also prove the existence of a similar universal operation for intrinsic randomness .",
    "further , in section vi - a , we derived the optimal generation rate of intrinsic randomness under the constant constraint concerning the normalized kl - divergence , which was mentioned as an open problem in han s textbook@xcite .",
    "finally , we should remark that the second order asymptotics correspond to the central limit theorem in the i.i.d .",
    "case while the first order asymptotics corresponds to the law of large numbers .",
    "but , in statistics , the first order asymptotics corresponds to the central limit theorem .",
    "concerning variable - length source coding , the second order asymptotics corresponds to the central limit theorem , but its order is @xmath14 .",
    "as seen in sections viii and [ 22 - 1 ] , the application of this theorem to variable- and fixed - length source coding is different .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain some notations for the information spectrum method in the first and the second order asymptotics in section ii .",
    "we treat the first order asymptotics of fixed - length source coding and intrinsic randomness based on variational distance in section iii , some of which are known . for the comparisons with several preceding results , we treat several versions of the optimal rate in this section .",
    "the second order asymptotics in both settings are discussed as the main result in section iv .",
    "we discuss the relation between the second order asymptotics and folklore for source coding based on variational distance in section v. in addition , we discuss intrinsic randomness based on kl - divergence , and the relation between han@xcite s criterion and the second order asymptotics in section vi .",
    "for comparison with han@xcite s result , we treat intrinsic randomness under another kl - divergence criterion , in which the input distributions of kl - divergence are exchanged . in section vii ,",
    "the markovian case is discussed .",
    "a universal fixed - length source code and a universal operation for intrinsic randomness are treated in section viii .",
    "all proofs are given in section ix .",
    "in this paper , we treat general information source . through this treatment",
    ", we can understand the essential properties of problems discussed in this paper .",
    "first , we focus on a sequence of probability spaces @xmath15 and a sequence of probability distributions @xmath16 on them .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the the logarithm of likelihood can be characterized by the following known quantities @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 is an element of the probability space @xmath22 .",
    "for example , when the probability @xmath23 is the @xmath4-th independent and identical distribution ( i.i.d . )",
    "@xmath7 of @xmath8 , the law of large numbers guarantees that these quantities coincide with entropy @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for a more detailed description of asymptotic behavior , we introduce the following quantities .",
    "@xmath25 for @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined for @xmath20 . when the distribution @xmath23 is the i.i.d .",
    "@xmath7 of @xmath8 , the central limit theorem guarantees that @xmath28 obeys the normal distribution with expectation @xmath11 and variance @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , by using the distribution function @xmath30 for the standard normal distribution ( with expectation @xmath11 and the variance @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 we can express the above quantities as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the relation between the above mentioned quantities , fixed - length source coding , and intrinsic randomness .",
    "in fixed - length source coding , first we fix a set of integers @xmath35 . the transformation from the output @xmath36 to an element of the set @xmath37",
    "is described by a map @xmath38 , which is called _",
    "encoding_.    the operation recovering the original output @xmath21 from the element of @xmath37 is described by a map @xmath39 , and is called _ decoding_. we call the triple @xmath40 a _ code _ , and evaluate its performance by its size @xmath41 and error probability : @xmath42 when we do not need to express the distribution of information source @xmath23 , we simplify @xmath43 to @xmath44 . in order to discuss the asymptotic bound of compression rate under the constant constraint on the error probability , we focus on the following values : @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath18 .",
    "further , as intermediate quantities , we define @xmath48 for @xmath49 . here , in order to see the relation with existing results , we defined many versions of the optimal coding length .",

    "next , we consider the problem of constructing approximately the uniform probability distribution from a biased probability distribution @xmath23 on @xmath22 .",
    "we call this problem intrinsic randomness , and discuss it based on ( half ) the variational distance in this section .",
