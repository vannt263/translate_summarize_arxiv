    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with active spin degrees of freedom have proven to be a fertile ground for studying cooperative quantum many - body phenomena in condensed matter systems . following the initial realization of becs with spin-1",
    "alkali atoms in an optical trap @xcite and description of the dynamics of the system @xcite , theoretical and experimental investigations of spinor becs have identified such diverse behavior as quantum phase transitions @xcite , domain and topological defect formation @xcite , coherent spin - mixing and amplification @xcite , and , most recently , dipolar effects @xcite .    in the experiment described in @xcite , a condensate of @xmath1rb atoms restricted to the ferromagnetic @xmath2 hyperfine manifold was prepared in the @xmath3 state via the quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "when the magnetic field was rapidly quenched , quantum fluctuations triggered the growth of unstable modes , leading to the formation of domains of magnetization with random orientations in the plane perpendicular to the spin - quantization axis .",
    "the instability is characterized by the inverse time constant @xmath4 and corresponding length scale @xmath5 , which are set by the strength of the spin - spin interaction [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : units ] ) ] . @xmath6 coincides with the spin - healing length , with @xmath7 for the conditions of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the exponential growth of the amplitude of a mode is proportional to @xmath8 and is controlled by the dimensionless gain parameter @xmath9 . in a homogeneous system , an unstable mode may be characterized by a wavevector @xmath10 . neglecting the dipolar interaction , one finds @xcite the gain parameter to be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is measured in units of @xmath13 .",
    "although the nature of the instability at early times ( @xmath14 ) has been successfully analyzed in the case of an infinite condensate @xcite , the effect of the trap geometry on the instability and spatial distribution of the associated magnetization has not been adequately addressed .",
    "this is a relevant question , since the experiment observed significant anisotropy in the magnetization correlation function which was attributed to the spatial anisotropy of the condensate .",
    "it was argued that as a result of the elongated shape of the condensate a small set of discrete modes in the trapped direction , rather than a continuum of states , led to preferential modulation of the magnetization in the confined direction .    in this paper",
    ", we account rigorously for the spatial quantization effects in the development of the instability of the polar phase .",
    "concentrating on the case of isotropic interactions within the @xmath2 manifold , we find that the correlation function [ eq .  ( [ eq : gfirst ] ) ] displays behavior precisely opposite to the one observed in experiment , i.e. , displays a more prominent magnetization modulation in the unconfined direction",
    ". the inconsistency may be due to distortions introduced by optical aberrations in the imaging device , and new experiments are underway @xcite .    to be specific , we consider a condensate whose thickness in the @xmath15-direction is comparable to or smaller than the spin - healing length so that the spin dynamics is effectively constrained to the @xmath16 plane .",
    "moreover , we assume that the condensate is infinite in the @xmath17-direction but short in the @xmath18-direction due to a confining potential .",
    "note that the effect of a trap on single - component condensates has already been analyzed extensively @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of a condensate with a spinor order parameter is complicated by the fact that , in the case of isotropic interactions within the @xmath2 manifold , the @xmath19 symmetry in spin space must be respected . in particular ,",
    "the simplest approach in which we keep the functional form of @xmath20 for an infinite system but restrict the allowed wavevectors to certain values by applying either hard - wall boundary conditions or periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) yields qualitatively incorrect results . in the case of hard - wall boundary conditions",
    ", @xmath21 takes on discrete values which exclude @xmath22 , which results in @xmath23 for all allowed values of @xmath10 and contradicts the existence of a zero mode in the @xmath19-symmetric case @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , although the presence of the zero mode is preserved by choosing pbcs in the @xmath18-direction , this results in the wrong systematics of unstable modes ( only an odd number of such modes are possible , and the maximal gain is identical for all modes with @xmath24 ) .",
    "the errors introduced by either of these two simplifications are insignificant for wide traps ( @xmath25 ) , but grow in importance with decreasing @xmath26 . for the typical trap widths of the order of a few @xmath27 , these errors are substantial enough to affect the qualitative features of the instability development . as an illustration , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : gain ] the gain parameter @xmath28 for a system with only a few modes spatially quantized in the @xmath18-direction by ( a ) pbcs and ( b ) a rigorous consideration of a harmonic trap . in the former case",
    "there are 2 ( 3 , accounting for @xmath29 degeneracy ) modes with equal maximum gain and another mode with a nearly - degenerate maximum .",
    "the exact degeneracy of the different maxima for @xmath24 arises because the differences in @xmath21 are compensated by different values of @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , the latter is characterized by substantial differences between the maxima of @xmath9 for different modes . in time",
    ", this leads to an increasingly pronounced anisotropy of the magnetization correlation function because a _ single _ mode with the largest gain dominates the growth of the nascent ferromagnetic phase .",
    "since this mode has a well - defined wavelength in the @xmath17-direction , increasingly strong oscillations between regions of positive and negative correlations are expected in the @xmath17-direction .",
    "note that when @xmath32 only a single mode corresponding to @xmath22 is unstable and applying pbcs makes qualitatively correct predictions for the behavior of the magnetization correlation function .",
    "indeed , this justifies our later treatment of the @xmath15-direction in a single - mode approximation , since @xmath33 .    in the following section we solve the equations of motion for the amplitude of the confined @xmath34 condensate during the exponential growth stage .",
    "on the basis of these solutions , in sec .",
    "iii we explore the anisotropy of the resulting magnetization correlation function .",
