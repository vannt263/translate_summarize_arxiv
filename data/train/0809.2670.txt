    "is opened .",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds )   provide a powerful and appealing framework for the description of the partonic structure of hadrons .",
    "gpds represent the interference between amplitudes corresponding to different quantum states and describe the correlations between quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons .",
    "they can be interpreted as the transverse distribution of partons carrying a certain longitudinal momentum fraction of the hadron  , providing then a natural link with the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , gpds unify in the same framework electromagnetic form factors , parton distributions , and the spin of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the observation by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) of a deviation of the deep inelastic structure function of a nucleus from the sum of the structure functions of the free nucleons  @xcite ( emc effect ) , shows that the nuclear environment has a significant impact on the partonic structure of nucleons .",
    "many years of theoretical and experimental efforts have led to the identification of four different kinematical regimes , however without providing a clear physical interpretation of this phenomenon .",
    "gpds bring a new and specific light on the understanding of the emc effect by allowing the investigation of the role of parton correlations as well as the parton distributions of bound nucleons , via the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) process .",
    "and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the momentum four - vectors of the initial and final proton are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath4=@xmath5=@xmath6 .",
    "the dis ( deep inelastic scattering ) scaling variable is @xmath7=@xmath8 and the dvcs scaling variable is @xmath9=@xmath10 . in light cone coordinates defined by @xmath11=@xmath12 , the initial and final momentum of the photons are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively.,width=222 ]    gpds are universal non - perturbative objects entering the description of hard scattering processes .",
    "they are defined for each quark flavor @xmath15 and gluon , and correspond to the amplitude for removing a parton of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 and restoring it with momentum fraction @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hdbg ] ) . in this process , the nucleus receives a momentum transfer @xmath18 which transverse component @xmath19 is fourier conjugate to the transverse position of partons .",
    "dvcs , corresponding to the absorption of a virtual photon by a quark followed quasi - instantaneously by the emission of a real photon , is the simplest reaction to access gpds . in the bjorken regim , @xmath20 and @xmath21 much larger than the quark confinement scale , the leading contribution to the reaction amplitude",
    "is represented by the so - called handbag diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hdbg ] ) which figures the convolution of a known @xmath22 hard scattering kernel with an unknown soft matrix element describing the partonic structure of the nucleus parametrized by gpds  .",
    "consequently , gpds ( @xmath23 ) enter the reaction cross section through the compton form factor @xmath24 which involves an integral over the intermediate quark propagators @xmath25 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 being the electric charge of the considered quark flavor in unit of the elementary charge .",
    "in addition to the dvcs amplitude , the cross section for electroproduction of photons gets contributions from the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process where the real photon is emitted by the initial or final lepton , leading to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scattered electron azimuthal angle and @xmath29 is the out - of - plane angle between the leptonic and hadronic planes .",
    "the bh and dvcs processes are undistinguishable but the bh amplitude is completely known and exactly calculable from the electromagnetic form factors .",
    "beam and/or target polarization degrees of freedom can be used to select different contributions to the cross section .",
    "particularly , the polarized cross section difference for opposite beam helicities can be used to isolate the imaginary part of the dvcs amplitude , according to the expression  @xcite @xmath30   \\label{eq : dif } \\\\ & = & { \\cal t}_{bh } \\ , \\im m \\{{\\cal t}_{dvcs}\\ } + \\re e \\{{\\cal t}_{dvcs}\\ } \\ , \\im m \\{{\\cal t}_{dvcs}\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 appears now linearly , instead of quadratically , and magnified by the bh amplitude .",
    "gpds may be classified according to their helicity and chirality properties  . for a spin @xmath32 nucleus",
    ", one can define @xmath33 parton helicity conserving and chiral even quark gpds , and @xmath33 parton helicity flipping and chiral odd quark gpds .",
    "the same number of gpds is needed for gluons , such that the complete partonic structure of the nucleus may be described by @xmath34 parton gpds , half of them conserving the nucleus helicity .",
    "dvcs is sensitive only to chiral even gpds and is dominated by quark or gluon gpds depending mainly on the studied @xmath35 region .    similarly to nucleon gpds , the optical theorem and the polynomiality constraints have remarkable consequences on nuclear gpds  .",
    "considering for example a scalar nucleus target @xmath36 , the quark and gluon gpds are linked to the forward parton distributions following @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the quark flavor @xmath15 density , transversity , and gluon distributions of the @xmath36 nucleus , respectively .",
    "the gluon heliciy - flip gpd is zero in the forward limit case .",
    "the first mellin moment relates the quark gpds to the nucleus electromagnetic form factor @xmath41 a similar relation can be written for the quark chiral odd gpd @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the spin - flavour dipole moment  @xcite of the isoscalar nucleus which may be accessed in electroproduction of neutral pions  @xcite .",
    "the second mellin moment for quark and gluon gpds writes @xmath44 where the first term of the right - hand side represents the momentum fraction of the target carried by the quark , and the second term is the nuclear d - term encoding information about the forces experienced by partons inside hadrons  @xcite . in the particular case of a spin 1/2 nucleus ,",
    "the d - term dependence drops out in the sum of second mellin moments of unpolarized chiral even gpds .",

    "[ jisr ] ) involves the @xmath46 gpd , a completely new distribution flipping the spin of the nucleus and therefore inaccessible to inclusive dis experiments .",
    "higher spin nuclei figure also several other unknown distributions related to peculiar features of the partonic structure of the nuclei  @xcite .",
    "coherent dvcs corresponds to the channel of the dvcs reaction off nuclei where the final state consists exclusively of the initial nucleus ( fig.[fig : coh ] ) .",
    "this process probes directly the nuclear gpds i.e. the gpds of the nucleus , that may be reconstructed from the elementary nucleon gpds   depending on specific models of the nuclear structure . as a consequence of the @xmath47-dependence of the nuclear electromagnetic form factors ,",
    "the coherent dvcs cross section is strongly suppressed as the momentum transfer to the nucleus increases .",
    "this expected behaviour was experimentally observed on several nuclei at hermes  @xcite and on the deuterium at jlab  @xcite .",
    "more dedicated exclusive experiments are required to obtain quantitative and conclusive information about nuclear gpds .",
    "particularly , the exclusivity constraint at small @xmath47 calls for the detection of the recoil nucleus .",

    "[ eq : phi_fit ]  @xcite .",
    "twist-3 nuclear gpds are mostly unknown distributions , and in the case of the @xmath48he nucleus , one may expect to get some information from the bsa in the region of the minimum of the electromagnetic form factor , i.e. in a region where the bsa depends only on pure dvcs quantities .    relying on this experimental technique , the e08 - 024 experiment at jlab  @xcite will provide high quality data to control the importance of the twist-3 contributions and extract the twist-2 @xmath48he compton form factor in the valence region ( fig .  [ fig : proj_cff ] ) .",
    "the exclusivity of the reaction channel will be ensured by the detection of the scattered electrons with clas  @xcite , the produced real photons with a specific internal calorimeter at small angles ( @xmath57 ) supplementing clas capabilities at larger angles , and the recoil nuclei with the bonus radial time - projection chamber  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath35 , and @xmath58 dependencies of @xmath49 will be measured , however in a limited phase space .",
    "an exhaustive investigation of coherent dvcs requires the full capabilities of the 12  gev upgrade .",

    "the ratio @xmath62 of the amplitude of the nuclear and nucleon bsas is then expected to be an indication of the nuclear medium effects on the partonic structure of the nucleus . in the case of an isoscalar target , and assuming the dominance of the bh cross section , this ratio may be written @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dirac(pauli ) nucleon electromagnetic form factor , and @xmath65 are the nucleon compton form factors .",
    "the approximated expression of ( eq .  [ eq : app ] )  @xcite makes clear the physical meaning of @xmath62 , especially in the forward limit where the gpds reduce to the usual parton distributions : @xmath62 can be interpreted as a generalized ( or off - forward ) emc ratio , characterizing nuclear medium effects in the direction transverse to @xmath66 .",
    "the benefit of this ratio , supported by several calulations  , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra ] .",
    "the generalized emc ratio appears to be a very sensitive observable to the ingredients of the calculations i.e. the measurement of this observable should help to disentangle unambiguously between the many scenarios proposed for the explanation of the emc effect . in this calculation , the striking stronger effects in the off - forward case suggest that the correlations between partons may play a crucial role in this problem .",
    "and energy @xmath67 in the initial nucleus i.e. the nuclear spectral function @xmath68.,width=192 ]    incoherent dvcs is a complementary chanel to coherent dvcs where , in addition to the production of a real photon , a nucleon is expelled from the intial nucleus . in the impulse approximation",
    ", this process may be described as the interaction of the virtual photon with a quark belonging to a nucleon embedded in the nuclear medium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inc ] ) .",
    "the elementary gpd information is basically the same for coherent and incoherent dvcs , the essential difference arising from the nuclear information : incoherent dvcs involves the usual nuclear spectral function @xmath68 while coherent dvcs considers a generalized skewed spectral function @xmath69  .",
    "consequently , incoherent dvcs can be considered as a direct way to access bound nucleon gpds which quantify the effect of the nuclear medium on free nucleon gpds  .",
    "the a@xmath70a-1 reaction isolates specifically partonic configurations of bound nucleons , and opens a new path for the investigation of bound nucleon properties . here , the perpendicular component of the momentum transfer to the nucleon is the fourier conjugate to the transverse position of partons inside the bound nucleon , an information required to access features like the confinement size of bound nucleons or the transverse overlap areas of hadronic configurations in the nucleus .",
    "similarly to the coherent case , nuclear medium effects may be expressed in terms of the bsa ratio @xmath71 for the incoherent and free nucleon processes @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the dirac(pauli ) bound nucleon electromagnetic form factor , and @xmath74 are the bound nucleon compton form factors .",
    "@xmath71 turns out to be a very sensitive observable to the details of the medium modification models  .",
    "future measurements of this observable off the @xmath48he nucleus  @xcite are strongly expected to help our understanding of bound nucleon properties .",
    "however , as in the a@xmath75a-1 reaction , one should be attentive to the effects of the initial fermi motion and to the reaction mechanisms beyond impulse approximation .",
    "this is of particular importance for the bh process which is used as a reference light to reveal deviations originating from the dvcs mechanism . in this respect ,",
    "the conservation of the electromagnetic current together with a reliable description of off - shellness effects are mandatory .",
    "final state interactions between the recoil nucleon and the residual nucleus are also expected to impact the extraction of the dvcs signal from the distortion of the simple scheme of the impulse approximation via interferring amplitudes and imaginary bh .",
    "the magnitude of these several effects are currently investigated  @xcite .      in abscence of free neutron targets ,",
    "few - body systems are often used as effective neutron targets .",
    "typically , the deuterium is considered as a free neutron target and polarized @xmath76he as an effective polarized neutron target ; higher mass nuclei feature important contributions from other reaction mechanisms which make the spectator nucleon picture unreliable  @xcite .",
    "dvcs off the neutron appears as a process complementary to dvcs off the proton , and is a mandatory step in the hunt for the quark angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the differences between neutron and proton electromagnetic form factors allow to access new combinations of gpds . furthermore , because of the electric charge weighting each flavor gpd ( eq .  [ eq : cff ] ) , the neutron is essentially sensitive to the @xmath77 quark flavor , similarly to the proton . consequently to isospin symmetry",
    ", the measurement of neutron gpds tells about the @xmath78 quark gpds in the proton .",
    "this is exactly the message that was delivered by the jlab hall a n - dvcs experiment  @xcite .",
    "the complementary between neutron and proton data was expressed in terms of a model dependent extraction of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 quark angular momenta ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jujd ] ) which shows that the beam polarized cross section difference off the neutron is , similarly to the transversely polarized target spin asymmetry , sensitive to the least known and constrained gpd @xmath67  @xcite of particular importance in the angular momentum sum rule  @xcite .     and @xmath79 quark angular momenta from the jlab hall a n - dvcs experiment  @xcite .",
    "different model calculations   are compared to an extrapolation of experimental data within the vgg double distribution description of gpds  @xcite .",
