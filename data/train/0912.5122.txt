    "this simple but crucial observation was made in @xcite,@xcite and it did not seem to be present in earlier mathematical work on solitons in external fields @xcite .    the condition made in the theorem , that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are bounded away from zero for @xmath30 ( where @xmath105 could be @xmath106 ) , follows from a condition involving a simpler system of decoupled @xmath107-independent odes  see appendix [ a : ode ] . here",

    "however , in the absence of avoided crossing of @xmath123 s the solitons can interact only once.,width=576 ]      to obtain the effective dynamics we follow a long tradition ( see @xcite and references given there ) and define the _ modulation parameters _ @xmath128 be demanding that @xmath129 satisfies symplectic orthogonality conditions : @xmath130 these can be arranged by the implicit function theorem thanks to the nondegeneracy of @xmath131 .",
    "this makes @xmath132 the symplectic orthogonal projection of @xmath133 onto the manifold of solitons @xmath134 .    since @xmath135 and @xmath133 solves mkdv , we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 results from the perturbation and @xmath139 landing on the parameters : @xmath140 we decompose @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is symplectic projection of @xmath138 onto @xmath143 , and @xmath144 is the symplectic projection onto its symplectic orthogonal @xmath145 . as seen in , @xmath146 is equivalent to the equations of motion ( we assume in the proof that @xmath147 ) .    using the properties of @xmath148 ,",
    "we show that @xmath144 is @xmath149 .",
    "in fact it is important to obtain a specific form for the @xmath150 term so that it is amenable to finding a certain correction term later  see ",
    "[ s : f - perp ] .    the estimates for @xmath151",
    "are obtained using the symplectic orthogonality properties of @xmath152 .",
    "for example , @xmath153 implies @xmath154 which can be used to show that @xmath155 see  [ s : parameters ] .",
    "the next step is to estimate @xmath152 satisfying with @xmath156 ( in the theorem @xmath157 , but we need this relaxed assumption for the bootstrap argument ) .",
    "we want to show that on a time interval of length @xmath158 , that @xmath152 at most doubles .",
    "the lyapunov functional @xmath159 that we use to achieve this comes from the variational characterization of the double soliton ( see @xcite and lemma [ l : e7 ] below ) : if @xmath160 then @xmath161 and @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a fourth order operator given in below .",
    "hence @xmath164 satisfies @xmath165 and , as in maddocks - sachs @xcite for kdv , @xmath166 has a two dimensional kernel and one negative eigenvalue .",
    "however , the symplectic orthogonality conditions on @xmath152 imply that we project far enough away from these eigenspaces and hence we have the coercivity @xmath167    to get the upper bound on @xmath159 , we compute @xmath168 see  [ s : energy ] .",
    "using we can estimate the second term on the right - hand side but @xmath169 only .",
    "we improve this to @xmath170 using a correction term to @xmath152  see  [ s : correction ] , and the comment at the end of this section .",

    "we conclude with the remark about the correction term added to @xmath152 in order to improve the bound on @xmath175 from @xmath176 to @xmath170 .",
    "a similar correction term was used in @xcite for nls @xmath10-solitons .",
    "together with the symplectic projection interpretation , it was the key to sharpening the results in earlier works . implementing the same idea in the setting of @xmath5-solitons is more subtle .",
    "the @xmath5-soliton is treated as if it were the sum of two decoupled @xmath10-solitons , the corrections are introduced for each piece , and the result is that @xmath144 is corrected so that @xmath177 that is , when @xmath178 , there is no improvement .",
    "however , this happens only on an @xmath179 time scale and hence does not spoil the long time estimate .",
    "unlike nls , kdv is a very friendly equation from the numerical point of view and matlab is sufficient for producing good results .",
    "we first describe the simple codes on which our experiments are based . instead of considering on the line ,",
    "we consider it on the circle identified with @xmath180 .",
    "to solve it numerically we adapt the code given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) which is based on the fast fourier transform in @xmath181 , the method of integrating factor for the @xmath182 term , and the fourth - order runge - kutta formula for the resulting ode in time .",
    "unless the amplitude of the solution gets large ( which results in large terms in the equation due to the @xmath183 term ) it suffices to take @xmath184 , @xmath185 , discretization points in @xmath181 .",
    "for @xmath186 we consider @xmath187 periodic in @xmath188 , and compute @xmath189 satisfying @xmath190 a simple rescaling , @xmath191 gives a solution of on @xmath192 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "when @xmath193 is small this is a good approximation of the equation on the line .",
