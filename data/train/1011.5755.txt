    "the building blocks of the large - scale structure in the universe are the galactic dark halos that are believed to underlie the luminous galaxies .",
    "although the galactic dark halos are not directly observable , their intrinsic properties can be inferred and estimated from the galaxy observables such as luminosity , color , morphology and spatial correlations .",
    "for instance , how luminous a given galaxy is related to how massive its underlying dark halo is .",
    "the colors and morphologies of the observed galaxies reflect the formation epochs and assembly history of their galactic halos .",
    "finding the hidden relations between the galaxy observables and intrinsic properties of the underlying dark halos is one of the most important tasks in the field of the large - scale structure .",
    "the directions of the galaxy angular momentum ( i.e. , the galaxy spin axes ) are one of those galaxy observables that are believed to have a direct connection with the intrinsic properties of the underlying dark halos . in the standard linear",
    "tidal torque theory @xcite , the tidal torques from the surrounding matter originate the angular momentum of the proto - galactic halos in the linear regime ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) . in consequence ,",
    "the directions of the angular momentum of the proto - galactic halos come to be aligned with the intermediate principal axes of the local tidal tensors @xcite .",
    "as the tidal fields are spatially correlated , the correlations between the spin axes of the proto - galactic halos and the principal axes of the local tidal tensors would induce the spatial correlations of the spin axes of the proto - galactic halos .",
    "a detailed analysis have shown that the spatial correlations of the spin axes of the galactic halos would follow a quadratic scaling with the two point correlation function of the linear density field provided that the linear tidal torque theory is valid @xcite .",
    "a critical question is whether or not the tidally induced initial correlations between the spin axes of the galactic halos have been retained to a detectable level and how strong the retained correlations are . if the intrinsic correlations of the spiral galaxies are detected and if we can model them well with the tidal torque theory , it would make it plausible to reconstruct the initial tidal fields from the observable spin fields as proposed by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it would have a direct impact on the weak lensing community where the intrinsic alignments of the spiral ( or blue ) galaxies are often assumed to be zero ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "plenty of observational efforts have so far been made to address this issue .",
    "@xcite measured the spatial correlations of the spin axes of the nearby spiral galaxies from the tully catalog and reported a tentative detection of @xmath11 signals .",
    "they claimed that the observed trend of the galaxy spin correlations is consistent with the quadratic scaling of the linear density two - point correlations . @xcite",
    "searched directly for the correlations between the spin axes of the nearby spiral galaxies and the intermediate principal axes of the tidal fields using the data from the point source galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the intrinsic shape correlations of the elliptical galaxies from the supercosmos survey @xcite are consistent with the quadratic scaling with the linear density correlations under the assumption that the projected minor axes of the observed elliptical galaxies are orthogonal to the projected spin axes of their underlying halos .",
    "@xcite noted that the distribution of the inclination angles of the nearby disk galaxies relative to the supergalactic plane is consistent with the prediction of the linear tidal torque theory .",
    "@xcite claimed that the observed alignments of the galaxies in the vicinity of large voids are well explained by the tidally induced intrinsic correlations .",
    "@xcite detected a @xmath11 signal of the correlations between the spin axes of the nearby spiral galaxies from the tully catalog and the intermediate principal axes of the local tidal field constructed from the 2mass redshift survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite measured the two dimensional projected spin correlations of the blue galaxies from the sloan survey @xcite and found a @xmath12 signal at one single distance bin of @xmath13mpc .",
    "@xcite found the correlations between the galaxy angular momentum vectors and the large - scale structures from the sloan survey and claimed that their results are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the tidal torque theory .",
    "@xcite reported a first detection of the chiral correlations of nearby galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the spin axes of the spiral galaxies in the filaments tend to be aligned with the major axes of the filaments and concluded that the observed spin alignments of the filament galaxies provide a fossil evidence for the tidally - induced intrinsic correlations .",
    "in spite of these observational evidences , it is still inconclusive whether or not the present galaxies still retain its initially memory of the tidally induced intrinsic spin correlations for the following two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the reported correlation signals are not strong enough to be confirmed as true signals .",
    "for instance , the galaxy spin correlation signals reported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are significant only at @xmath14 levels .",
    "the samples on which the analyses of @xcite and @xcite were based are so small that their conclusions suffer from poor number statistics .",
    "furthermore , there have reported some counter evidences against the existence of the intrinsic galaxy alignments .",
    "for example , @xcite searched for the alignments of the spin vectors of the galaxies in abell clusters but failed in finding any signals .",
    "as for the strong correlations of the projected major axes of the elliptical galaxies measured by @xcite , although it is good number statistics , the signals suffer from large uncertainties associated with regarding the projected major axes of the elliptical galaxies as the directions orthogonal to the spin axes of the underlying dark halos .",
    "true as it is that the minor axes of the elliptical galaxies should be more or less aligned with the spin axes of their underlying dark halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their spatial correlations are not so good tracers of the linear tidal fields as the spin correlations of the spiral galaxies , since the shapes of the elliptical galaxies are apt to be affected by the subsequent processes such as the anisotropic merging / infall , galaxy - galaxy interactions and etc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the best targets for the measurement of the tidally - induced intrinsic alignments are the spiral galaxies and their spin orientations .",
    "the second reason comes from the concerns about spurious signals that could be produced by systematics .",
    "there are three major sources for the systematics in the measurement of the intrinsic correlations of the galaxy spin axes : the weak gravitational lensing effect , presence of thick central bulges and inaccurate measurements of the spin axes in case that the galaxies have small angular sizes .",
    "it has been known that the extrinsic alignments of the galaxy shapes due to the weak gravitational lensing effect would create spurious signals of the spin - spin correlations of the spiral galaxies ( or ellipticity - ellipticity correlations of the elliptical galaxies ) at redshifts @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the presence of thick central bulges in the spiral galaxies could cause significant systematics since it invalidates the circular thin - disk approximation which is almost exclusively used to measure the orientations of the galaxy spin axes . in case that the galaxies have small angular sizes , their position angles and axial ratios would be difficult to measure accurately , which would propagate into the systematic errors in the measurement of the galaxy spin axes .",
    "the errors caused by the above three systematics in the measurement of the intrinsic correlations can be minimized if one selects only the large late - type spiral galaxies ( of hubble types scd ) observed at lowest redshifts . using only low-@xmath16 galaxies",
    ", one can reduce the weak gravitational lensing effect to a completely negligible level . selecting only large late - type spiral galaxies which have the smallest central bulges",
    ", one can guarantee that the measurements of the spin axes through the circular thin disk approximation are reliable . to select such galaxies from the observational data , however , it is necessary to have information on the spectroscopic redshifts and hubble types of the observed galaxies .",
    "very recently , @xcite have released a catalog of the galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ) , in which such information are all available .",
    "our goal here is to measure the true intrinsic correlations of the nearby large late - type spiral galaxies from this catalog and to study their behaviors and their dependence on the local density and luminosity .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  2.1 ,",
    "the sample of the nearby large late - type galaxies selected from the sdss dr7 is described and the number distributions of the selected galaxies as a function of their magnitude and local density are derived . in ",
    "2.2 , it is explained how the spin axes of the selected galaxies are determined up to two - fold degeneracy with the help of the circular thin disk approximation . in ",
    "3.1 , the correlations between the spin axes of the selected nearby large scd galaxies are measured and the bootstrap error analysis is presented . in  3.2 the dependence of the galaxy spin correlations on local density and luminosity is investigated . in  3.3",
    "the possible residual systematics are discussed and its effect is examined . in  4 , the observational results are compared with the analytic models based on the tidal torque theory and the bestfit parameters to quantify the strengths of the correlations are determined.in  5 , the results are summarized and a conclusion is drawn .",
    "the galaxy catalog compiled by @xcite consists of a total of @xmath17 galaxies in redshift range of @xmath18 from the sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "it provides information on spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath16 ) , right ascension ( @xmath19 ) , declination ( @xmath20 ) and the probabilities of being in the five morphological classes ( e ,  ell ,  s0 ,  sab ,  scd ) for each galaxy . through private communication with m. huestra - company ,",
    "we obtain additional information on the major and minor axes , position angle ( @xmath21 and r - band model magnitude @xmath22 ) of each galaxy in the catalog .    to minimize the systematics in the measurement of the spatial correlations of the galaxy spin axes , we select only those galaxies which have redshifts in the range of @xmath1 , probability of being in the morphological class of scd higher than @xmath23 , and angular size ( given as the major axis length ) @xmath24 larger than @xmath25 arcsec ( corresponding to 20 pixels in the sdss frames ) .",

    ", we determine the comoving distance to each galaxy in unit of @xmath29mpc assuming a wmap7 cosmology @xcite .    to determine the local density of the selected galaxies , we first construct a volume - limited sample of the galaxies ( regardless of their types ) in the same redshift range from the sdss spectroscopic data .",

    "with the help of the circular thin - disk approximation and given information on the inclination angle @xmath42 and position angle @xmath41 , we determine the unit spin vector , @xmath48 , of each selected nearby scd galaxy in a local spherical - polar coordinate system up to sign - ambiguity of the radial component as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 correspond to the radial , polar and azimuthal component of @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "this sign - ambiguity in the radial components of @xmath48 is due to the fact that one can not determine whether the rotation of a given galaxy upon its symmetry axis is clock - wise or counter - clock wise @xcite .    using information on the equatorial coordinates , @xmath51 , we determine the unit spin vector of each selected scd galaxy in the cartesian coordinate system up to two - fold degeneracy as @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "finally , to each selected nearby scd galaxy , we assign a set of two unit spin vectors , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which differ from each other by the sign of @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath61 is subtracted since it is the value of the ensemble average when there is no correlation . in practice , however , due to the two - fold degeneracy in the determination of @xmath48 , the correlation @xmath62 can be measured only as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the unit spin vector measured at @xmath65 .    for all pairs of the galaxies ,",
    "we calculate the squares of the dot products of their unit spin vectors , taking into account the two - fold degeneracy . binning the separation distances @xmath4 , we take the ensemble average over those pairs whose separation distances belong to a certain distance bin and subtract @xmath61 to determine @xmath62 in accordance with equation ( [ eqn : prac ] ) .",
    "although we try to reduce systematic errors as much as possible through constraining the redshift - range , morphology and angular size , there could be some residual systematics . to sort out possible residual systematics , we perform a bootstrap error analysis .",
    "the spin correlation functions , @xmath62 , are remeasured from each of the @xmath66 bootstrap resamples which is constructed through shuffling randomly the positions of the selected galaxies .",
    "the bootstrap errors , @xmath67 , are calculated as @xmath68 where the ensemble average is taken over the @xmath66 resamples and @xmath69 represents the bootstrap mean . if there were no residual systematics in the measurement of the galaxy spin axes , then the bootstrap mean value would be very close to zero .",
    "the degree of the deviation of the bootstrap mean from zero would indicate the level of the residual systematics .",
    "figure [ fig : spincor_z ] plots the observed galaxy spin correlations for four different cases of the galaxy angular size cut ( @xmath70 and @xmath25 arcsec in the top - left , top - right , bottom - left and bottom - right panel , respectively ) . in each panel",
    "the error bars represent one standard deviation , @xmath71 , in the measurement of @xmath62 .",
    "the thin solid and dashed line in figure [ fig : spincor_z ] represents the bootstrap mean @xmath69 and bootstrap errors , @xmath67 , respectively , while the thin dotted line corresponds to the zero signal . as it can be seen , a clear signal as strong as @xmath72 is detected for all four cases of @xmath73 at the second radial bin corresponding to the distance of @xmath74 . for the cases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 arcsec ,",
    "the third radial bins corresponding to @xmath8mpc also exhibit a @xmath77 signal while for the other two cases of @xmath78 and @xmath25 , the correlation at @xmath79mpc diminishes down to @xmath80 level .    as mentioned in  1 , for the galaxies having small angular sizes",
    "the spin axes are difficult to measure accurately .",
    "as it can be seen from figure [ fig : spincor_z ] , for the two cases of @xmath75 and @xmath76 arcsec where the small angular size galaxies are included , the mean bootstrap values ( thin solid line ) show non - negligible deviations from zero ( larger than @xmath81 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath77 signals detected at @xmath8mpc for these two cases are likely to be contaminated by the systematics .",
    "figure [ fig : booterr ] shows more clearly how the averaged bootstrap mean value changes with @xmath73 . as it can be seen , the bootstrap mean value decreases as @xmath73 increases and drops below @xmath81 ( negligible level ) when @xmath73 reaches up to @xmath25 arcsec , which justify our choice of @xmath82 arcsec for this analysis .    since the correlation function , @xmath62 ,",
    "is computed as a function of the three dimensional separation , there may be some cross - correlations at different radii .",
    "if the cross - correlations between the second and third radial bins are significant , then the signal detection for the second radial bin would have lower significance . to quantify the amount of cross - correlations ,",
    "we compute the covariance matrix , @xmath83 , that is defined @xmath84 where the ensemble average is taken over @xmath66 bootstrap resamples , @xmath85 is the correlation at the @xmath86-th bin from a bootstrap resample , and @xmath87 is the bootstrap mean at the @xmath86-th bin .",
    "if the cross - correlations between the second and third radial bins are significant , then the off - diagonal component , @xmath88 , would be comparable in magnitude to the diagonal component , @xmath89 .",
    "it is found that @xmath90 while @xmath91 .",
    "this implies that the cross - correlations between the second and third radial bins are order of magnitude smaller ( and even negative ) than the correlations at the second radial bins , which proves that the signal detected at the second radial bin is robust .",
    "now that we have detected non - zero galaxy spin correlations from the sdss data , we would like to investigate whether or not @xmath62 depends on the local number density @xmath92 of neighbor galaixses . applying the number density cut , @xmath93 , to the sample , we divide the selected scd galaxies into two subsamples each of which consists of those nearby large scd galaxies with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively",
    ". then , we measure @xmath62 from each subsample separately , the results of which are plotted in the top and bottom panel of figure [ fig : spincor_den ] , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , for the subsample with @xmath96 , we find a correlation signal as significant as @xmath97 signal at @xmath98mpc , while for the subsample with @xmath99 , no correlation signal is detected .",
    "the bootstrap mean values are quite close to zero for both of the cases , which indicates that the detected signal is not spurious .",
    "this result shows that those scd galaxies located in denser regions tend to have stronger spin correlations .",
    "a possible physical explanation is that the galaxies located in denser regions experience so stronger tidal forces from the surrounding neighbor mass distribution that the tidally - induced intrinsic correlations of their spin axes are better retained , which is consistent with the previous results of @xcite .",
    "using the galaxy pairs in which one galaxy has @xmath95 and the other has @xmath94 , we also measure the cross - correlations of the spin axes between the two subsamples , the result of which is plotted in figure [ fig : spincor_crossden ] .",
    "as one can see , the result is consistent with zero cross - correlation , which reveals that the spin axes of the galaxies in less dense regions are not correlated with those of the galaxies in denser regions .    to investigate how the intrinsic correlations depend on the luminosity , we take the median @xmath4-band absolute magnitude , @xmath100 , as the threshold @xmath101 , and divide the selected galaxies into two subsamples each of which consists of those nearby large scd galaxies with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "then , we measure @xmath62 from each subsample separately , which are plotted in the top and bottom panel of figure [ fig : spincor_mag ] , respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , the correlation function , @xmath62 , exhibits a @xmath104 peak at @xmath98mpc and a @xmath80 peak at @xmath8mpc in the fainter and brighter galaxy sample , respectively .",
    "this result , however , can not be interpreted as a clear luminosity dependence of the galaxy spin correlations .",
    "in fact , the peaks of @xmath62 detected at @xmath105mpc and @xmath10mpc ( for the fainter and brighter sample , respectively ) turn out to correspond to a similar angular separation of galaxy pairs .",
    "it indicates the existence of significant residual systematics , which is also manifest from the relatively high degree of the deviation of the bootstrap mean from zero for the fainter sample as shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : spincor_mag ] .",
    "furthermore , the redshift distributions of the two subsamples are found to be largely different : the brighter ( fainter ) sample is biased to relatively higher ( lower ) redshifts , as shown in figure [ fig : zdis ] .",
    "the mean and median redshifts of the two subsamples are also listed in table [ tab : zdis ] . given that there should exist significant systematics and that it is impossible to disentangle a luminosity from a redshift dependence of the galaxy spin correlations , we admit that a luminosity dependence of the galaxy spin correlations can not be measured with our magnitude - split samples .    in  3.3 , we discuss fully the possible sources of this residual systematic errors involved in the measurement of the spin correlations of the fainter galaxies . before moving on to the discussion on systematics , we also measure the spin cross correlations between the fainter and brighter samples , the result of which is plotted in figure [ fig : spincor_crossmag ] .",
    "as can be seen , a strong anti - correlation of the spin axes as significant as @xmath77 is found at @xmath106mpc . in other words ,",
    "the spin axes of the fainter galaxies tend to be orthogonal to that of the brighter galaxies separated by the distance of @xmath107mpc .",
    "given the numerical and observational results from the previous works @xcite , we explain this observational result as follows : the spin axes of the fainter galaxies are aligned with the intermediate principal axes of the local tidal fields as predicted by the linear tidal torque theory .",
    "whereas for the brighter galaxies which are usually located in cosmic filaments , their spin axes tend to be aligned with the longest axes of the local filaments , i.e. , the minor principal axes of the local tidal fields @xcite , as revealed by the recent numerical results from hydrodynamic simulations @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "the two subsamples have strong anti spin - correlations between each other .",
    "the separation distance of @xmath108mpc at which the strong anti - correlations are detected should be the typical separation between the faint isolated and bright wall galaxies .      for the accurate measurement of the galaxy spin correlations ,",
    "we have tried to eliminate systematic errors as much as we can by constraining the redshift , morphological type and angular size of the sdss galaxies .",
    "the small bootstrap errors shown in the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : spincor_z ] suggests that no severe systematics be existent in our constrained sample , and thus that our detection of the spin correlations be robust .",
    "nevertheless , it has to be admitted that our results may not be completely free from systematics .",
    "a possible source of residual systematics could be related to the constant value of the intrinsic flatness parameter , @xmath109 in equation ( [ eqn : xi ] ) that we adopt in accordance with @xcite to account for the finite thickness of the scd galaxies .",
    "given that this value of @xmath109 was obtained by @xcite from a sample of hi 21 cm observations and that the shape of the neutral hydrogen distribution does not necessarily coincide with the optical shape of a galaxy , one may suspect that a different value of @xmath44 should be used for the galaxies from the optical sdss survey .",
    "an ideal way would be to look at the individual images of the optical shapes of the sdss galaxies and to search for the optimal value to @xmath44 for the selected scd galaxies .",
    "this task , however , would be extremely time consuming and thus should be beyond the scope of this paper .    instead",
    ", we inspect how the final results would change as we use different values to @xmath44 in equation ( [ eqn : xi ] ) .",
    "@xcite explained that unless a galaxy has a well developed bulge like the early type spirals , the intrinsic flatness parameter must have the value in range of @xmath110 .",
    "since we select only scd galaxies which optical shapes must have the thinnest bulges , we expect that the value of @xmath44 would not differ significantly from @xmath111 .",
    "figure [ fig : flat ] plots the same as figure [ fig : spincor_z ] but for four different cases of the intrinsic flatness parameter ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) .",
    "as one can see , the final results change less than @xmath114 as the value of @xmath44 changes from @xmath115 to @xmath113 , which justify our choice of @xmath109 .",
    "another possible source of residual systematics is the limitation of the circular disk approximation .",
    "the morphology class of scd from the sdss catalog includes the irregular galaxies @xcite , for which the circular thin disk approximation would be invalid .",
    "but , through private communication with m.huertas-company , we have learned that the fraction of the included irregular galaxies must be small since the irregular galaxies are usually fainter while the targets of the spectroscopic sdss sample are brighter .",
    "the relatively larger bootstrap mean values of @xmath62 for the fainter samples shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : spincor_mag ] are most likely to be caused by the inaccurate measurement of the spin axes of the irregular galaxies that are included in the subsample of the fainter galaxies ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "an ideal way should be to look at the individual images of the fainter galaxies and sort out the irregular galaxies from the fainter sample . however , it would be also extremely time consuming and thus should be beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    ", we just state explicitly that the residual systematics could cause spurious signals of correlations for the fainter scd galaxy sample , which is most likely to be due to the limitation of the circular thin disk approximation and that a better algorithm for the measurement of the spin axes of the irregular galaxies would be desirable .",

    "the best - fit value of @xmath125 is found to be @xmath136 and the corresponding value of @xmath129 is found to be @xmath137 ( see table [ tab : parameter ] ) . here , the error associated with the measurement of @xmath125 is determined as @xcite @xmath138 now that the reduced @xmath129 is found to be close to unity and the best - fit value of @xmath125 is found to be @xmath139 higher than zero , it can be said that the observed spin correlations are indeed tidally induced , having quadratic scaling with the linear density correlations , as predicted by the linear tidal torque theory .",
    "we note here that both of the best - fit value of @xmath125 are larger than that determined by @xcite through fitting of the numerical data from the millennium run simulations ( see table 3 in lee & pen 2008 ) .",
    "there are two important implications of this result .",
    "first of all , the spin orientations of the luminous galaxies may not be perfectly aligned with those of their dark halos , which is consistent with the previous numerical results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second of all , the luminous galaxies have retained better the initial memory of the tidally induced intrinsic spin - spin correlations than their dark halos . this phenomenon may be explained as follows .",
    "the luminous galaxies are located in the inner parts of the galactic halos while the dark matter particles are stretched to the outer parts of the dark halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , the spin orientations of the luminous galaxies may be less vulnerable than those of their dark counterparts to the destructive nonlinear effects from the surroundings which would break the tidally induced intrinsic correlations .",
    "the fitting results for the subsamples with @xmath96 and @xmath102 are also plotted in figures [ fig : spincor_hden_theory ] and [ fig : spincor_dim_theory ] , respectively .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath125 and the minimum value of @xmath129 corresponding to these two cases are also listed in the second and third rows of table [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "as one can see , for the case of @xmath96 , the best - fit value of @xmath125 has the largest value , approximately @xmath140 . as mentioned in  3.2",
    ", it may be due to the stronger tidal forces from the surrounding .",
    "selecting those large nearby late - type spiral galaxies which have angular sizes larger than @xmath25 arcsec , low redshifts ( @xmath1 ) , and morphological type of scd from the sdss dr7 , and we have measured the spatial correlations between their spin axes .",
    "the summary of our results is the following .    * a clear signal of the intrinsic correlation as strong as @xmath72 and @xmath80 ( where @xmath67 is the bootstrap error ) is detected at @xmath98mpc and @xmath141mpc , respectively .",
    "the cross - correlations between the two radial bins are found to be insignificant . * the galaxies having more than ten neighbors within separation of @xmath10mpc exhibit higher intrinsic spin correlations ( at @xmath97 level ) than those having ten or less neighbors within the same separation distance .",
    "this local density dependence of the galaxy spin correlations may be due to the stronger tidal forces from the denser environments . *",
    "the observed spin correlation functions of the selected scd galaxies follow the quadractic scaling with the linear density correlations , which is consistent with the prediction of the linear tidal torque theory .",
    "we have also attempted to measure a luminosity dependence of the galaxy spin correlations by splitting the galaxy samples according to their absolute @xmath4-band magnitudes ( @xmath39 ) , and noted that the correlation function has a peak at @xmath105mpc and @xmath10mpc for the fainter ( @xmath142 ) and brighter sample ( @xmath103 ) , respectively . however , the two peaks from the two magnitude - split samples turn out to correspond to a similar angular separation , which hints at significant systematics . to make matters worse ,",
    "the redshift distributions of the two magnitude - split samples are found to be so different that it is impossible with our samples to disentangle a luminosity from a redshift dependence of the galaxy spin correlations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a luminosity dependence of the galaxy spin correlations can not not be measured from our samples",
    ".    the behaviors of the detected correlations are found to be consistent with the predictions of the tidal torque theory .",
    "but , the correlation strength turns out to be greater than predicted by the numerical simulations .",
    "this result indicates that the spin orientations of the luminous galaxies are not aligned with those of the underlying dark halos and that the luminous galaxies retain better the initial memory of the tidally induced spin alignments than their dark counterparts .",
    "it is physically explained as the spin orientations of the luminous galaxies may be less vulnerable than those of their dark counterparts to the destructive nonlinear effects from the surroundings which tend to break the tidally induced intrinsic correlations .",
    "it has to be understood fully in the future how and under what circumstances the spin axes of the late - type spiral galaxies have retained their original orientations .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the apparent inconsistency between our results and the previous studies which claimed that the two dimensional projected shapes of the blue sdss galaxies show no correlation at higher redshifts , @xmath143 , ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that we have detected @xmath5 correlation signal at @xmath144 and that the intrinsic spin correlations of the blue galaxies would be stronger at higher redshifts , one may naturally expect that the shape correlations of the blue galaxies at @xmath143 would be strong enough to affect the weak lensing signals , which is inconsistent with the previous results .",
    "we think of several reasons for this inconsistency : first , the two dimensional projected shapes of the blue galaxies may not be a good indicator of the tidally induced alignments ; second , there may be considerable uncertainties involved in the accurate measurements of the shape correlations of the blue galaxies at @xmath143 . as a final conclusion",
    ", our results will shed a new light on the study of the galaxy intrinsic alignments and the weak lensing analysis as well .",
