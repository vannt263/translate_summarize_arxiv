    "neutrino oscillations imply the violation of individual lepton flavours and raise the interesting possibility of observing lepton flavour violation in processes with charged leptons , such as @xmath8 or @xmath9 . in the standard model",
    "these processes are strongly suppressed due to small neutrino masses . in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model",
    ", however , the situation may be quite different .",
    "for example , the slepton mass matrices need not simultaneously be diagonalized with the lepton mass matrices .",
    "when sleptons are rotated to the mass eigenstate basis , the slepton mass diagonalization matrices @xmath10 enter the chargino and neutralino couplings @xmath11 and mix lepton flavour ( latin and greek subscripts refer to the mass - eigenstate and flavour basis , respectively ) .",
    "contributions from virtual slepton exchanges can therefore enhance the rates of rare decays like @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , once superpartners are discovered , the supersymmetric lepton flavour violation ( slfv ) can also be searched for directly at future colliders where the signal will come from the production of real sleptons ( either directly or from chain decays of other sparticles ) , followed by their subsequent decays .",
    "searches for slfv at colliders have a number of advantages : superpartners can be produced with large cross - sections , flavour violation in the production and decay of sleptons occurs at tree level and therefore is suppresed only by powers of @xmath13 @xcite in contrast to the @xmath14 suppression in radiative lepton decays , where slfv occurs at one - loop ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "generally , respecting the present bounds on rare lepton decays , large slfv signals are possible both at the lhc @xcite and at @xmath2 colliders @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in some cases the lhc and future @xmath2 colliders may provide competitive tools to search for and explore supersymmetric lepton flavour violation .    in this note",
    "we first discuss the sensitivity at future @xmath2 colliders to slfv independently of the lepton flavour violating mechanism .",
    "the simulation has been performed assuming a simplified situation with a pure 2 - 3 intergeneration mixing between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and ignoring any mixings with @xmath17 . in the analysis the mixing angle @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the specific lepton flavour violating processes @xmath20 involving slepton pair production and subsequent decay @xcite .",
    "in discussing the slfv collider signals at future colliders , one has to distinguish two cases in which an oscillation of lepton flavour can occur : in processes with slepton pair production and in processes with single slepton production , which differ in the interference of the intermediate sleptons @xcite .",
    "slepton pair production is the dominant mechanism at lepton colliders , but it may also occur at hadron colliders via the drell - yan process .",
    "single sleptons may be produced in cascade decays of heavier non - leptonic superparticles .",
    "such processes are particularly important for hadron colliders , but they may also be relevant for lepton colliders where a single slepton can be the decay product of a chargino or neutralino .",
    "the amplitudes for pair production , @xmath21 , and single production , @xmath22 , read , e.g. , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the respective production and decay amplitudes for sleptons in the absence of slfv , and @xmath10 stands for the lepton flavour mixing matrix element .    for nearly degenerate in mass and narrow sleptons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the products of slepton propagators can be simplified as follows @xmath28 then , in the case of 2 - 3 intergeneration mixing , the cross - sections for the above processes ( [ amplseins ] , [ amplszwo ] ) , take a particularly simple form @xcite : @xmath29 & & \\sigma^{\\rm sin}_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\chi_{23 } \\sin^2 2\\tilde{\\theta}_{23}\\ ; \\sigma(f\\,f'\\to l^+_\\alpha \\",

    "the slepton flavour violating mixing effects are encoded in @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in the limit @xmath35 , @xmath36 approaches 1/2",
    ", the interference can be neglected and the cross - sections behave as @xmath37 . in the opposite case ,",
    "the interference suppresses the flavour changing processes , and @xmath38 .    to assess the sensitivity of a 500 gev @xmath2 linear collider to the slfv",
    ", the following processes have been analysed @xmath39 here @xmath40 , and @xmath41 escapes detection .",
    "the signature of slfv would be @xmath42 , @xmath43 , or @xmath44 , depending on the hadronic or leptonic @xmath45 decay mode .",
    "the purely leptonic decay modes are overwhelmed by background .",
    "in particular , the neutralino pair production process ( [ neutlfv ] ) , which could still be open if the second chargino and sleptons were too heavy for ( [ snulfv ] ) and ( [ charlfv ] ) , is difficult to extract from background . on the other hand , with charginos decaying hadronically ,",
    "the signal @xmath46 comes from both processes ( [ snulfv ] ) and ( [ charlfv ] ) and is sm - background free .",
    "the flavour - conserving processes analogous to ( [ snulfv ] ) and ( [ charlfv ] ) , but with two @xmath47 s in the final state where one of the @xmath47 s decays leptonically to @xmath48 , contribute to the background .",
    "on the other hand , if jets are allowed to overlap , an important sm background to the final states with @xmath49 comes from @xmath50 .    the simulation of the signal and background has been performed for one of the mssm representative points chosen for detailed case studies at the ecfa / desy workshop @xcite : a msugra scenario defined by @xmath51 gev , @xmath52 gev , @xmath53 gev , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a simple parton level simulation has been performed with a number of kinematic cuts listed in @xcite .",
    "for the processes ( [ snulfv ] ) and ( [ charlfv ] ) we find after cuts the following cross - sections , @xmath56 fb and @xmath57 fb , respectively , while the background amounts to 0.28 fb .",

    "[ fig_jk ] the significance is given by @xmath60 where s and b are the numbers of signal and background events , respectively , for a given luminosity .",

    "the boundary c shows the reach in the process @xmath64 alone ( previously studied in @xcite ) using our cuts and assuming a luminosity of 500 fb@xmath63 .",
    "the chargino contribution increases the sensitivity range to @xmath65 by 10 - 20% , while the sensitivity to @xmath66 does not change appreciably .    in the same figure ,",
    "the contour lines for constant branching ratios of @xmath67 are shown for comparison @xcite . in the limit of small mass",
    "splitting , @xmath68 can be calculated in the flavour basis using the mass insertion technique @xcite . in our 2 - 3 intergeneration mixing scenario the radiative process",

    "[ fig_jk ] have been obtained from the approximate formula of ref.@xcite , normalized to the current experimental limit , @xmath71 \\left(\\frac{100 \\mbox { gev } } { { \\tilde m}}\\right)^4 \\label{max}.\\ ] ] this approximation only provides an order of magnitude estimate of the upper limit for the supersymmetric contribution to the radiative lepton decay .",
    "the exact result , which is sensitive to the details of mass spectra and mixings , can in fact be much smaller due to cancellations among different contributions @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig_jk ] demonstrates that information from slepton production and decay could be competitive to the radiative lepton decays .",
    "in particular a lc can help to explore the small @xmath58 region .",
    "it should be stressed , though , that in a given model for lepton flavour violation also the correlation with @xmath72 has to be considered @xcite , which in many cases can yield a more severe bound , as discussed in the next section .",
    "as a definite and realistic example for slfv we consider the seesaw mechanism in msugra models . in supersymmetric theories with heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos , the seesaw mechanism @xcite can give rise to light neutrino masses at or below the sub - ev scale .",
    "furthermore , the massive neutrinos affect the renormalization group running of the slepton masses , generating flavour off - diagonal terms in the mass matrix .",
    "these in turn lead to slfv in scattering processes at high energies and in rare decays . for illustration of the potential and complementarity of such slfv searches we focus on the lc processes @xmath20 involving slepton pair production and subsequent decay , and on the corresponding radiative decay @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , in an early atlas note @xcite @xmath73 is estimated to be observable at the lhc for a branching ratio of order @xmath74 .",
    "however , the limit one can reasonably expect may be an order of magnitude better @xcite .    for our study",
    "we use the msugra benchmark scenarios proposed in @xcite for lc studies , concentrating on those which predict charged left - handed sleptons that are light enough to be pair - produced at the center - of - mass energy @xmath75  gev .",
    "furthermore , we implement the seesaw mechanism assuming degenerate majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos and constrain the neutrino yukawa couplings by the measured masses and mixings of the light neutrinos .",
    "further sources of slfv exist in other models such as guts @xcite .",
    "however , no realistic three generation case study of effects for collider processes has been performed so far , so that we restrict the discussion to the minimal seesaw model , here .      if three right - handed neutrino singlet fields @xmath76 are added to the mssm particle content , one has the additional terms @xcite @xmath77 in the superpotential .",
    "here , @xmath78 is the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath79 is the right - handed neutrino majorana mass matrix , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the left - handed lepton and hypercharge + 1/2 higgs doublets , respectively . at energies much below the mass scale @xmath82 of the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath83 leads to the following mass matrix for the light neutrinos : @xmath84 from that the light neutrino masses @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 are obtained after diagonalization by the unitary mns matrix @xmath88 .",
    "the basis is chosen such that the matrices of the charged lepton yukawa couplings and majorana masses are diagonal , which is always possible .    furthermore , the heavy neutrino mass eigenstates give rise to virtual corrections to the slepton mass matrix that are responsible for lepton flavour violating processes . more specifically , in the msugra models considered , the mass matrix of the charged sleptons is given by @xmath89 with @xmath90 when @xmath91 is evolved from the gut scale @xmath92 to the electroweak scale characteristic for the experiments , one obtains @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the common soft susy - breaking scalar mass and @xmath95 the common trilinear coupling .",
    "the terms @xmath96 and @xmath97 are well - known flavour - diagonal mssm corrections .",
    "in addition , the evolution generates the off - diagonal terms @xmath98 and @xmath99 which , in leading - log approximation and for degenerate right - handed majorana masses @xmath100 , are given by @xcite @xmath101    in order to determine the product @xmath102 of the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix entering these corrections , one uses the expression @xmath103 which follows from @xmath104 and ( [ eqn : seesawformula ] ) @xcite . here , @xmath105 is an unknown complex orthogonal matrix parametrizing the ambiguity in the relation of yukawa coupling and mass matrices . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath105 to be real which suffices for the present purpose .",
    "in this case , @xmath105 drops out from the product @xmath102 , @xmath106 using existing neutrino data on the mass squared differences and the mixing matrix @xmath88 together with bounds and assumptions on the absolute mass scale one can calculate @xmath102 .",
    "the only free parameter is the majorana mass scale @xmath82 .",
    "the result is then evolved to the unification scale @xmath92 and used as an input in the renormalization group corrections ( [ eq : rnrges ] ) to the slepton mass matrix .",
    "finally , diagonalization of ( [ mslept ] ) yields the slepton mass eigenvalues @xmath107 and eigenstates @xmath108 ( @xmath109 .      the flavour off - diagonal elements ( [ eq : rnrges ] ) in @xmath110 ( @xmath111 in the msugra scenarios of @xcite ) induce , among other slfv effects , the processes @xmath112 , where slfv can occur in the production and decay vertices .",

    "as can be seen , for a sufficiently large majorana mass scale the slfv cross - sections can reach several fb .",
    "the spread of the predictions reflects the uncertainties in the neutrino data .",
    "the standard model background mainly comes from @xmath137-pair production , @xmath137 production with @xmath138-channel photon exchange , and @xmath47-pair production . a 10 degree beam pipe cut and cuts on the lepton energy and missing energy",
    "reduce the sm background cross - sections to less than 30  fb for @xmath139 final states and less than 10  fb for @xmath140 final states .",
    "if one requires a signal to background ratio , @xmath141 , and assumes a typical signal cross - section of 0.1  fb , one can afford a background of about 1  fb . here",
    "an integrated luminosity of 1000  fb@xmath63 has been assumed . whether or not the background process estimate above can be further suppressed to this level by applying selectron selection cuts , for example , on the acoplanarity , lepton polar angle and missing transverse momentum has to be studied in dedicated simulations . for lepton flavour conserving processes it has been shown that the sm background to slepton pair production can be reduced to about 2 - 3  fb at @xmath75  gev @xcite .",
    "the mssm background is dominated by chargino / slepton production with a total cross - section of 0.2 - 5  fb and 2 - 7  fb for @xmath142 and @xmath140 final states , respectively , depending on the susy scenario and the collider energy .",
    "the mssm background in the ( @xmath143 ) channel can also contribute to the @xmath144 channel via the decay @xmath145 .",
    "if @xmath146 and @xmath147 are very light , like in scenarios b and i , this background can be as large as 20  fb .",
    "however , such events typically contain two neutrinos in addition to the two lsps which are also present in the signal events .",
    "thus , after @xmath47 decay one has altogether six invisible particles instead of two , which may allow to discriminate the signal in @xmath148 also from this potentially dangerous mssm background by cutting on various distributions .",
    "but also here one needs a dedicated simulation study , in order to make more definite statements .    the corresponding branching ratios , @xmath123 and @xmath149 , in model b",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mue - taumu ] @xcite .",
    "one sees that a positive signal for @xmath72 at the minimum branching ratio observable in the new psi experiment , @xmath150 @xcite would imply a value of @xmath82 between @xmath151  gev and @xmath152  gev . in comparison",
    "to @xmath72 the channel @xmath69 is less affected by the neutrino uncertainties . if the sensitivity goal @xmath153 @xcite at the lhc is reached one could probe @xmath154  gev .    particularly interesting and useful are the correlations between slfv in radiative decays and slepton pair production .",
    "such a correlation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutau_lowhigh ] for @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "one sees that the neutrino uncertainties drop out , while the sensitivity to the msugra parameters remains .",
    "an observation of @xmath73 with the branching ratio @xmath157 at the lhc would be compatible with a cross - section of order 10 fb for @xmath158 , at least in model c. however , there are also correlations of different flavor channels .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutau800 ] , where the correlation of @xmath155 and @xmath159 is shown .",
    "despite of the uncertainties from the neutrino sector , already the present experimental bound @xmath160 yields a stronger constraint on @xmath161 than the one obtained from fig .  [ fig : mutau_lowhigh ] , making cross - sections larger than a few @xmath162  fb at @xmath130  gev very unlikely in model b. if this scenario is correct , non - observation of @xmath163 at the new psi experiment will exclude the observability of this channel at a lc . as a final remark we stress that in the channel @xmath164 cross - sections of 1  fb are compatible with the present bounds , while no signal at the future psi sensitivity would constrain this channel to less than 0.1  fb .",
    "however we want to emphasize again that these statements are very model dependent , and much bigger cross - sections are possible in general , as shown in section [ sfcs ] .",
    "if superpartners are discovered at future colliders , we advocate the search for susy lepton flavour violation as a high priority topic of the experimental programme . at a lc",
    ", the most favourable signals are expected to come from the production and decay of sleptons and charginos . considering only lfv in the @xmath165 sector , a case motivated by the large atmospheric neutrino mixing but more difficult to detect than lfv in the @xmath166 sector due to the presence of decaying taus",
    ", we have shown that the lc measurements may be complementary to searches for the radiative @xmath47 decay at the lhc .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath167 at the lhc combined with the slfv signal at a lc would point to @xmath168 and @xmath169 gev .    in the context of the susy seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation",
    ", correlations between slfv in radiative decays and slepton pair production have been found particularly interesting .",
    "for instance , in a given mssm scenario the measurement of @xmath170 at the lhc would imply a definite cross section for @xmath171 at the lc . assuming a reasonable set of mssm benchmark scenarios and @xmath167 and using the present neutrino data , one predicts @xmath172 in the range 0.05 to 10 fb .",
    "however , the non - observation of @xmath72 with a branching ratio of about @xmath173 at the new psi experiment would exclude the observability of @xmath161 at a linear collider . while the former correlation involving the same lepton flavours is insensitive to the uncertainties in the neutrino data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mutau_lowhigh ] ) , the latter correlation is somewhat smeared out ( fig . [",
    "fig : mutau800 ] ) . however , both types of correlations remain sensitive to the msugra parameters and , hence , provide very useful tools for probing the origin of lepton flavour violation .",
    "the complementarity of the lhc and lc ( and of low - energy experiments ) in the context of lepton flavour violation is far from being exhausted by the present study .",
    "quantitative analyses of the impact of precise mass measurements at the lc on identifying the lfv decay chains at the lhc ( and vice - versa ) and other important features call for detailed monte carlo simulations which should be undertaken in the next round of the lhc / lc studies .",

    "<S> second , we study lepton flavour violating slepton pair production and decay at a future @xmath2 linear collider in the context of the seesaw mechanism in msugra post - lep benchmark scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the correlations of these signals with the corresponding lepton flavour violating rare decays @xmath3 , and show that these correlations are particularly suited for probing the origin of lepton flavour violation .    </S>",
