    "the study of the quantum manifestations of classical chaotic motion has greatly improved our understanding of quantum mechanics in relation to the properties of eigenvalues , eigenfunctions as well as to the time evolution of complex systems @xcite .",
    "according to the van vleck - gutzwiller s semiclassical theory @xcite , the quantum dynamics , even deeply in the semiclassical region , involves quantum interference of contributions from a large number of classical trajectories which exponentially grows with the energy or , alternatively , with time .",
    "this interference manifests itself in various physical effects such as universal local spectral fluctuations , scars in the eigenstates , elastic enhancement in chaotic resonance scattering , weak localization in transport phenomena and , also , in peculiarities of the wave packet dynamics and in the decay of the quantum loschmidt echo ( fidelity ) @xcite : @xmath0\\right|^2\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "therefore , the echo operator @xmath5 represents the composition of a slightly perturbed hamiltonian evolution with an unperturbed time - reversed hamiltonian evolution . the unperturbed part of the evolution can be perfectly excluded by making use of the interaction representation , thus obtaining @xmath6\\ , ; \\quad { \\cal h}(\\tau)=e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}h_0\\tau}ve^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}h_0\\tau}\\,.\\ ] ] therefore , the fidelity ( [ def ] ) can be seen as the probability , for a system which evolves in accordance with the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath7 , to stay in the initial state @xmath8 till the time @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity ( [ def ] ) , whose behavior depends on the interference of two wave packets evolving in a slightly different way , measures the stability of quantum motion under perturbations .",
    "its decay has been investigated extensively in different parameter regimes and in relation to the nature of the corresponding classical motion ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most remarkably , it turns out that a moderately weak coupling to a disordered environment , which destroys the quantum phase correlations thus inducing decoherence , yields an exponential decay of fidelity , with a rate which is determined by the system s lyapunov exponent and independent of the perturbation ( coupling ) strength @xcite . in other words ,",
    "quantum interference becomes irrelevant and the decay of fidelity is determined by classical chaos .",
    "this result raises the interesting question whether the classical chaos , in the absence of any environment and only with a perfectly deterministic perturbation @xmath10 , can by itself produce mixing of the quantum phases ( dephasing ) strongly enough to fully suppress the quantum interference .",
    "the answer is , generally negative .",
    "indeed , though the `` effective '' hamiltonian evolution ( see eq .  ( [ fint ] ) ) is in accordance with the chaotic dynamics of the unperturbed system so that the actions along distant classical phase trajectories are statistically independent , still there always exist a lot of very close trajectories whose actions differ only by terms of the order of planck s constant .",
    "interference of such trajectories remains strong . in this paper",
    "we show that , nevertheless , if the evolution starts from a wide and incoherent mixed state , the initial dephasing persists due to the intrinsic classical chaos so that quantum phases remain irrelevant .",
    "we remark in this connection that any classical device is capable of preparing only incoherent mixed states described by diagonal density matrices .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixed ] , we discuss two different definitions of fidelity for mixed states . sec .",
    "[ sec : iontraps ] introduces the kicked nonlinear oscillator which can serve as a model for an ion trap . the fidelity decay for this model in the chaotic regime",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fidpure ] ( for pure coherent states ) and [ sec : fidmixed ] ( for mixed states ) .",
    "this latter section analytically establishes a link between dephasing and decay of a suitable classical correlation function .",
    "this link is numerically confirmed in sec .",
    "[ sec : krot ] for the kicked rotor model , whose fidelity decay may be measured by means of cold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "finally , our conclusions are drawn in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the case of a mixed initial state ( @xmath11 ) , fidelity is usually defined as @xcite @xmath12= \\frac{1}{{\\rm tr}(\\overset{\\circ}\\rho^{\\,2 } ) } { \\rm tr}[{\\hat f^{\\dag}(t)}\\overset{\\circ}\\rho{\\hat f(t)}\\overset{\\circ}\\rho].\\ ] ] note that for a pure state ( @xmath13 ) eq .",
    "( [ fm ] ) reduces to ( [ def ] ) .",
    "another interesting possibility is suggested by the experimental configuration with periodically kicked ion traps proposed in @xcite . in such ramsey type interferometry experiments one directly accesses the fidelity amplitudes ( see @xcite ) rather than their square moduli . motivated by this consideration , we analyze in this paper the following natural generalization of fidelity : @xmath14 which",
    "is obtained by directly extending formula ( [ def ] ) to the case of an arbitrary mixed initial states @xmath15 . the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "is the sum of fidelities @xmath16 of the individual pure initial states with weights @xmath17 , while the second , interference term depends on the relative phases of fidelity amplitudes . if the number @xmath18 of pure states @xmath19 which form the initial mixed state is large , @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 for @xmath22 and zero otherwise , then the first term is @xmath23 at the initial moment @xmath24 while the second term @xmath25 .",

    "[ f1 ] ) is different from the mixed - state fidelity @xmath28 ( eq .  [ fm ] ) and from the _ incoherent _ sum @xmath29 of pure - state fidelities typically considered in the literature .",
    "the two latter quantities both contain only transition probabilities @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , the function @xmath31 directly _ accounts for the quantum interference _ and can be expected to retain quantal features even in the deep semiclassical region .",

    "this quantity is reconstructed after averaging the amplitudes over several experimental runs ( or many atoms ) .",
    "each run may differ from the previous one in the external noise realization and/or in the initial conditions drawn , for instance , from a thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "note that the averaged ( over noise ) fidelity amplitude can exhibit rather different behavior with respect to the averaged fidelity @xcite .",

    "returning to the averaged fidelity ( [ incoh ] ) , it can be decomposed into the sum of a mean ( @xmath140 ) and a fluctuating part : @xmath141 as we have already stressed above , the two fidelities @xmath31 and @xmath142 are quite different in nature .",
    "nevertheless , due to the dephasing induced by classical chaos , the decays of these two quantities are tightly connected : they both decay with the same rate though the decay of @xmath143 is delayed by a time @xmath144 . to show this ,",

    "the fidelity ( [ fm ] , [ ffm ] ) has a well defined classical limit which coincides with the classical fidelity @xcite and decays due to the phase flow out of the phase volume initially occupied .",
    "this has nothing to do with dephasing . in particular",
    ", if the initial distribution is uniform in the whole phase space the fidelity ( [ fm ] ) never decays .    in closing this section ,",

    "this expectation is a consequence of the randomization of phases of fidelity amplitudes and is borne out by the numerical data shown in fig .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that the decay of the quantum fidelity @xmath31 , when the initial state is a fully incoherent mixture , is determined by the decay of a classical correlation function , which is totally unrelated to quantum phases .",

    "( [ clfmix ] ) reproduces not only the slope but also the overall decay of the function @xmath31 .",
    "the classical dynamical variable that appears in this autocorrelation function depends on the form of the perturbation .",
    "therefore the echo decay , even in a classically chaotic system in the semiclassical regime and with quantally strong perturbations , is to some extent perturbation - dependent .",
    "the quantum dephasing described in this paper is a consequence of internal dynamical chaos and takes place in absence of any external environment .",
