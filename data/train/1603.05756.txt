    "though the standard model ( sm ) has been verified to be correct times by times , many new physics beyond standard model are proposed to solve both experimental and aesthetical problems , such as neutrino masses , @xmath1 anomalous magnetic movement problem or hierarchy problem , etc .",
    "many new models introduce vector like particles ( vlp ) @xcite whose right handed and left handed components transform in the same way under the weak su(2)@xmath2u(1 ) gauge group .",
    "the extension is acceptable because the anomalies generated by the vlps cancel automatically , and vector quarks can be heavy naturally .",
    "vlps also arise in some grand unification theories .",
    "for example , in order to explain the little hierarchy problem between the traditional gut scale and string scale , a testable flipped @xmath3 model are proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the tev - scale vlps were introduced  @xcite .",
    "such kind of models can be constructed from the free fermionic string constructions at the kac - moody level one  @xcite and from the local f - theory model  @xcite .",
    "however when we do the flavor physics with doublet vlps in these models  @xcite , a problem always appears when we are dealing with the mass spectrum of quarks and leptons .",
    "let us start with the sm in which all fermion masses come from the yukawa couplings .",
    "after the spontaneously gauge symmetry breaking , we can get two separate mass matrices @xmath4 for the up and down type fermions .",
    "the mass eigen states are obtained after the diagonalization @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the physical measurable parameters are @xmath8 and the so called ckm matrix @xmath9 since @xmath4 come from separate yukawa couplings , we can always set one of the matrices diagonal , for example @xmath10 , and use the ckm matrix to get the yukawa couplings @xmath11 for the calculation in flavor physics . note that @xmath12 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs , and @xmath13 is a random unitary matrix",
    ".    such a trick can not be used in case of the participation of a vector doublet , namely @xmath14 with gauge charge @xmath15 and @xmath16 with gauge charge @xmath17 , resulting bilinear term in the lagrangian @xmath18 it is clear that in the model , there are the same input parameters in the matrices @xmath4 @xmath19 the mass matrices for up and down type quarks are related to each other .",
    "therefore , we can not set one of the matrices diagonal and the ckm matrix can not be got easily .",
    "the shooting method is always used to treat such an obstacle .",
    "random @xmath10 and @xmath20 are generated to meet the requirements after diagonlization : the mass of eigen state and the measurements of elements of ckm matrix .",
    "however this is too much time consuming , and precise solution for diagonalization is almost unavailable .",
    "although this is just a numerical problem , when one treats the vlp contributions to the flavor physics seriously , diagonalization of quark matrices will be the first and important step .    in this paper",
    ", we will first propose a general method to solve the obstacle in models with vector like quark doublets .",
    "as its application , we will study rare b decay @xmath0 in the sm with one vector like quark doublet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we show the detail of the trick in section  2 .",
    "the simple application to @xmath0 process , including quark mass spectrum , feynman rules and the wilson coefficients , as well as the numerical analysis for calculation of @xmath0 is shown in section  3 .",
    "a summary is given in section  4 .",
    "firstly , we address the problem clearly on how to deal with the diagonalization of @xmath21 matrix @xmath10 and @xmath20 : @xmath22 in which @xmath23 are the diagonal mass matrices for up and down type quark , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath24 should be greater than 3 and the first three elements in the matices should be the three generations of quark multiplates in the sm , other elments with @xmath25 are the new multiplates introduced in new physics beyond the sm",
    ". then we have @xmath26 the last line of the two matrices has the same parameters except the last elements .    considering that there are some same parameters in @xmath10 and @xmath20 , we find that a very simple way is to add two matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mvud ] ) @xmath27 the left side of the equation is @xmath28 obviously , the mass inputs from bilinear terms vanish .",
    "we can denote the matrix in the form as @xmath29 in which @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 matrices correspondingly .    to prepare for the diagonalization , we chose the diagonal mass matrix elements of quarks @xmath36 , @xmath37 and a matrix @xmath38 , which are determined partly by experimental measurements as input parameters @xmath39 note that above @xmath40 are unitary matrices , but @xmath41 is not an ordinary ckm matrix @xmath42 which is non - unitary in this case .",
    "detailed dicussion will be shown in the following section .",
    "what we need to do for the next is to generate a unitary matrix @xmath43 . in the similar way we denote @xmath43 as @xmath44 both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqvud ] ) times the matrix @xmath43 , we can get @xmath45 from above equation , we can get the last line of @xmath43 simply by inputting @xmath46 and random @xmath47 , @xmath13 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a unit vector in @xmath24 dimension .",
    "next we use the unit vector to generate total @xmath43 . since @xmath30 and @xmath31 are random matrix , @xmath43 can be random too .",
    "the unit vector @xmath50 of @xmath43 can be determined as @xmath51 it is clear that the vector is orthogonal to @xmath52 and normalized to 1 .",
    "then we use the first three elements of @xmath53 and @xmath50 to generate @xmath54 : normalize the algebraic complements of first line of the @xmath55 matrix .",
    "step by step , we can finally get ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath50 ) and form a special @xmath59 @xmath60    from above steps , we can see that ( @xmath56 , @xmath61 , @xmath58 , @xmath50 ) can be rotated into any other orthogonal @xmath62 vectors to construct random matrix @xmath30 and @xmath31 , only @xmath52 must be kept unchanged .",
    "therefore , a general unitary matrix can be realized by timesing a unitary @xmath21 matrix @xmath63 , @xmath64 in which @xmath65 is a @xmath66 unitary matrix .",
    "we finish the work by @xmath67    at this stage , we would like to summarize our method here    * step 1 : chose ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath38 and generate random unitary matrices @xmath47 and @xmath13 as the inputs for the model ; * step 2 : determine the last line of matrix @xmath69 as @xmath70 and normalize it into a unit vector @xmath71 .",
    "* step 3 : use the unit vector @xmath71 to generate other @xmath62 unitary vectors ( @xmath56 , @xmath61 , @xmath58 , @xmath50 ) , and form a special @xmath72 @xmath73 * step 4 : generate a @xmath62 unitary matrix @xmath65 to form a unitary matrix @xmath63 which is @xmath74 then , a general @xmath43 is obtained by @xmath75 * step 5 : use these equations @xmath76 to get the inputs for the flavor physics .",
    "we can see that by this trick we can skip the inputs of the bilinear mass terms @xmath77 . in physical analysis ,",
    "the mass of eigen states @xmath78 in the vlp models are inputs freely . @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "can be generated randomly , @xmath81 and @xmath43 can also be scanned the most generally if we vary @xmath63 randomly .",
    "thus the method can do the most general scan in the parameter space of mass matrices in the models with vlps for the numerical studies , which will be shown in the following section .",
    "cc    .a simple extension of the standard model with one vector like quarks doublet [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the model with three generation quarks , the ckm matrix unitarity is already used in the calculations of the loop - level fcnc induced rare b decays . for consistency , in numerical analysis",
    "the constraints on ckm matrix element are not from processes occurred at loop level , such as rare b decays , but from tree - level processes shown in table  [ tab : c1b ]  @xcite .",
    "since there are no tree - level measurements of @xmath82 , @xmath83 now , we use above inputs and the unitarity to get @xmath84 unitary matrix at first .",
    "the method is that we scan @xmath85 randomly ( keeping @xmath86 ) in range listed in table  [ tab : c1b ] , then we define two parameters @xmath87 and solve them by the equations @xmath88 @xmath89 are got by the unitarity relation with @xmath85 and @xmath90 .",

    "( [ ud_z1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ud_z2 ] ) , we can see that in order to keep gauge universality of quarks , the tail terms in the feynman rules must be much smaller than the sm like terms , namely @xmath101 .",
    "thus in the numerical studies we require    @xmath102    note that though these elements are greater than @xmath103 ( parameter in the wolfenstein parameterization @xcite ) , they are much smaller than the product of @xmath104 ( almost equals @xmath105 ) , thus the requirements are suitable for indicating the contraints from the deviation from unitarity .    since the scanning in the parameter space is freely , we set @xmath106 ( mass of top quark plus 1000 gev ) and scan @xmath107 in the range of @xmath108 ( mass of bottom quark plus 1000 gev ) , and @xmath109 randomly ( ignoring the cp phases ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] which checks the mass input of vector doublet .",
    "we can see that @xmath110 increases as @xmath107 growing up .",
    "however @xmath110 is much smaller than @xmath113 and @xmath107 .",
    "small mixings lead to parameter @xmath98 which determine the mixing between sm quarks and vector like quarks are also suppressed .",
    "this is in agreement with that the deviation from unitarity is suppressed by the ratio @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes generically the standard quark masses , which is a typical result of vlp models .",
    "@xcite    the second task is to check the vlp contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "we find the wilson coefficient of fcnc operator @xmath116 is not so suppressed as the mixing .",
    "the new contributions , from the terms of the last line in eq.([fc7 ] ) are suppressed by the mixing , whereas the terms of first line are almost the same as the sm .",

    "@xmath121 is in fact got from the coefficient of first term in the second line of analytical expression of @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ fc7 ] ) when @xmath123 .",
    "it will be changed into exactly @xmath120 in case of the sm4 .",
    "note that other terms with @xmath117 can give enhancement too , we chose factor @xmath121 for a typical demonstration since it seems that it will be suppressed by @xmath113 .",
    "results are shown in the fig [ fig3 ] in which the left panel shows @xmath121 and @xmath120 versus @xmath110 while the right panel shows @xmath124 versus @xmath121 . from the left panel , we can see that though @xmath120 increase as @xmath110 increases , it is still much smaller than @xmath125 , implying that deviation of unitarity are negligible .",

    ", we can see that @xmath121 enhances @xmath127 up to a value much larger that the result of the sm .",
    "the reason for the enhancement mainly comes from the new type of yukawa couplings .",

    "this is different from those in the sm4 in which the contribution from the fourth generation can be neglected .    in the numerical scan ,",
    "we vary @xmath137 and @xmath138 randomly , keeping the constraints of @xmath139 , scan @xmath113 and @xmath107 in the range of @xmath140 . apart from the ckm limits",

    "the method of running of the operators from @xmath146 scale to @xmath147 scale can be found in ref .",
    "we use the following bounds on the calculation @xcite @xmath148 the numerical results show that the @xmath149 is much smaller than @xmath150 , therefore we do not present the formula of @xmath151 here .    the branching ratio as a function of @xmath152 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , from which we can see that @xmath153 can be enhanced much greater than the experiment bound .",
    "then the measurements of fcnc process can give a stringent constraint on the vector like quark model , especially when the masses of vector quark are much greater than the electro - weak scale .",
    "a few remarks should be addressed :    * there is one point of view on the unitarity of the ckm matrix which is that the @xmath154 ordinary quark mixing matrix is regarded as nearly unitary , deviation from unitarity is suppressed by heavy particle in the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "in other word , one admits that the extended ckm matrix elements exist , they approach to zero while mass scale of the new physics approaches to infinity .",
    "all the new physical effects should decouple from the flavor sector and what should be checked is that if @xmath55 unitariry is consistent in all kinds of flavor processes .",
    "* another point of view is that , as in the sm case , the @xmath154 ordinary quark mixing matrix elements are only extracted by experiments in the measurements of tree and loop level precesses .",
    "the unitarity should be checked , experiment measurements on the elements of matrix can be used as the constraints to the new physics beyond the sm . in the numerical analysis ,",
    "the elements of ckm matrix are regarded as inputs .",
    "thus what should be done is to scan the parameter space generally under these constraints , no prejudice should be imposed .",
    "then the enhancement effect in @xmath0 will be more clear .",
    "large parameter space is excluded by the measured branching fraction of @xmath141 as shown in fig .",
    "the enhancement effect of the vlps can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in which the left panel shows the enhancement factor @xmath121 versus @xmath113 while the right panel shows @xmath120 versus @xmath113 . from the right panel we can see that deviation from unitarity are very small and almost irrelevant with @xmath113 since we are doing a general scan of @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "however as we see from the left panel , as @xmath113 increases up , @xmath155 measurement will constrain the enhancement factor and then constrain the input parameter of @xmath113 . in all , the enhancement can be summarized as that when mass of vector like particle increases up , it will increase the mass parameter @xmath152 thus give an enhancement factor under very small deviation from unitarity",
    ". this should be a special point when we do the study on the vector like quark models .",
    "in the model with vector doublets , there exist bilinear terms in the lagrangian , making the general scan of the yukawa coupling very difficult . in this paper ,",
    "we show a trick to deal with the scan .",
    "our scan method are exactly and the more efficient .",
    "we use the trick to study a very simple extension of the sm with vector like quarks .",
    "we studied one of the most important rare b decay @xmath141 process in which we found that even the deviations from the unitarity of quark mixing matrix are small , the enhancement to rare b decay from vlps are still significant .",
    "the enhanced effect is an important feature in the vector like particle model . in this work",
    "we just show the scan method , the key point of the enhancement and how stringent constraints on the parameter space from @xmath141 measurements .",
    "what should be done includes models like extension of the sm with vlps , two higgs doublets models @xcite or supersymmetry models @xcite .",
