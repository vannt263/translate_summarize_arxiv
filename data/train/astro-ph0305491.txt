    "a picture of the  based on these results has emerged @xcite and is summarized in figure[fig : schematic ] .",
    "the he - flash convection zone homogenizes the intershell region and @xmath3  produced in the he - burning shell is mixed up to just below the location of the h - burning shell .",

    "the @xmath23ne neutron source is only marginally activated .",
    "it is most reasonable to assume that the h/@xmath3-ratio in the partial mixing zone varies somehow continuously from a few hundreds in the envelope to zero in the intershell .",
    "then , one finds in the top layers of the partial mixing zone another pocket made of @xmath5 , which forms where the h/@xmath3-ratio is larger than where the @xmath4  pocket forms . without further mixing the partial mixing layer is strictly stratified during the interpulse period : as shown in figure[fig : schematic ]",
    "the two pockets coexist without much interaction . during the interpulse phase",
    "the temperature does not reach values required for the @xmath45f reaction .",
    "the @xmath5  pocket is engulfed into the following he - flash convection zone where it might slightly contribute to the production of @xmath46 .",

    "* and following studies by that group ) and @xcite have studied the  by assuming a certain proton profile extending into the @xmath3-rich region without relating explicitly to a specific physical process . in these studies",
    "it was implicitly assumed that any subsequent alterations of the abundances in the partial mixing zone are due to nucleosynthesis only and no mixing takes place during the interpulse phase after the initial formation of the partial mixing zone . in this way it was possible to develop a fairly good understanding of the  nucleosynthesis in the @xmath4  pocket .",
    "for example , it was shown that many observations are reproduced with models in which the neutron exposure in the @xmath4  pocket is up to @xmath47 at solar metallicity . in order to account for the observed",
    "overabundances the partial mixing zone needs to have a mass of @xmath48 - @xmath49 .",
    "these  models with an assumed h - profile for the partial mixing zone can account for many of the overall observed properties of the .    however , to explain the observed  signature in agb stars as a function of metallicity , the  model described above requires that stars of the same mass and metallicity have different neutron exposures due to the @xmath4  neutron source during the agb interpulse phase @xcite . a mixing process for the formation and evolution of this neutron source that allows for some _ spread in the efficiency of producing neutrons _ seems to be necessary .",
    "@xcite arrive at the same conclusion from observations of weakly metal - poor post - agb stars with @xmath50 feature . in these objects",
    "the  element signatures are easier to measure than in the cool progenitor agb stars .",
    "also the spread in the pb abundance observed in very low - metallicity stars ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could fit into the current  model only if there is a spread in the number of neutrons available in the pocket for the .",
    "such a spread in the efficiency of the @xmath4  neutron source is also required to explain the measurements of isotopic ratios in single pre - solar silicon carbide grains ( sic ) recovered from pristine carbonaceous meteorites @xcite .",
    "the majority of these grains are believed to have formed in the circumstellar dusty envelopes surrounding carbon stars .",
    "the main evidence for this comes from measurements of aggregates of sic that have shown a very strong signature of the  in the heavy elements present in trace ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed measurements of the composition of sr , zr , mo and ba in single sic grains .",
    "isotopic ratios that are sensitive to the efficiency of the @xmath4  neutron source have been found to show a large spread within the single grain data .",
    "this can be explained if sic grains were formed in a multiplicity of low mass agb stars with a range of neutron exposures in the @xmath4  pocket .",
    "these isotopic ratios are those involving nuclei with very low neutron capture cross section such as nuclei with number of neutrons equal or near to nuclear magic numbers , i.e. @xmath51sr/@xmath52sr , @xmath53zr/@xmath54zr and @xmath55ba/@xmath56ba .",
    "a detailed analysis of sic grain data indicated that a spread of the order 5 is necessary in the neutron exposure for a given mass and metallicity @xcite .",
    "these new insights are specifically important for constraining the physical processes which are responsible for the partial mixing between envelope and core , and thereby lead to the formation of the @xmath4  neutron source .",
    "moreover , neutron capture elements are in general becoming an increasingly important target of stellar observations , for example of ir - observations in planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "the open problem addressed in this paper is the role of rotational mixing .",
    "rotation is an effect that has to be taken into account when studying stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis .",
    "most f stars , which are the main sequence progenitors of low - mass agb stars , show rotational velocities of a few hundred @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the importance of rotation as a physical process in agb stars is not restricted to mixing and nucleosynthesis .",
    "rotation in stars during their late evolutionary phase possibly drives the shaping of bipolar proto - planetary nebulae . according to the interacting - stellar - winds model @xcite a fast ionized stellar wind interacts with an equatorially dense agb circumstellar envelope that could be the result of inhomogeneities associated with rotation .",
    "this model can qualitatively explain the presence of sharp radial structures and the wide variety of shapes found in planetary nebulae ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that elliptical or weakly bipolar planetary nebulae shapes can result from dust - driven winds of rotating agb stars .",
    "@xcite considers the possibility that increased rotation in an agb envelope may result from swallowing another celestial body , like a companion star in a binary system or an orbiting planet .",
    "indeed , this hypothesis gains support from the recent discovery of many extra - solar planets and the detection of water vapour around evolved agb stars , possibly due to the presence of comets @xcite .",
    "@xcite present hydrodynamical models in which an equatorial density enhancement originates around an intermediate mass single agb star with a fast rotating core that can spin up the extended envelope during mixing events associated with the he - shell flashes .",
    "@xcite evolved a @xmath0 stellar model from the main sequence to the agb phase including the effects of rotation on the stellar structure and mixing .",
    "they found that rotationally induced mixing at the core - envelope interface after a thermal pulse could be responsible for the formation of the partial mixing zone that hosts a @xmath4  pocket and subsequent   nucleosynthesis .",
    "they also found that mixing in the partial mixing layer continues throughout the entire interpulse phase . in this paper",
    "we investigate mixing and the  at the core - envelope interface of this stellar model with rotation .",
    "we will also present a comparison with models including mixing due to hydrodynamic overshooting as well as parametric models that further illustrate the effect of slow mixing of the  layer during the interpulse period .    in the current model",
    "the  occurs in every interpulse - pulse cycle from when third dredge - up starts until the end of the agb evolution .",
    "several stellar parameters that are important for the computation of the , e.g. the mass of the intershell , the temperature at the base of the convective shell , the overlapping factor between subsequent pulses and the third dredge - up , are different at each interpulse - pulse cycle .",
    "detailed  calculations , such as those of @xcite , take into account these effects .",
    "however , the features of the @xmath4  pocket are kept the same in each interpulse , and the changes in the temperature are not large enough to affect the modality of the burning of @xmath4  in different interpulses .",
    "the only effect is that in detailed calculations the neutron exposure in the pocket slightly decreases with the interpulse number because the amount of material increases in the intershell .",
    "we perform simulations of the  over only one interpulse period , which in first approximation represents all the interpulse periods . in  [ sec : obs - pm ] we derive the basic properties of the partial mixing zone and interpulse  layer from average observational features and simplified agb evolution properties .",

    "the properties of a partial mixing zone that reproduces the features observed in agb stars can be studied in detail with models including the effect of many consecutive thermal pulses and neutron exposure events @xcite . here",
    "we derive some basic constraints on the properties of the  zone by following a much simpler approach .",
    "we consider two  indicators : the index @xmath59 is the overproduction factor of  elements with respect to the initial solar value .",
    "we have used for this index the average of the production factors of y and nd .",
    "the index [ hs / ls ] = [ hs / fe ] - [ ls / fe ] monitors the distribution of the  elements .",

    "the observed overproduction factors in the envelope are related to the overproduction factors in the  zone by two dilution factors that result from two subsequent mixing events : the he - flash convective mixing and the third dredge - up . assuming that no significant amount of  material is available in the envelope initially and considering only the contribution of the  in the interpulse , the abundance of any species in the envelope after third dredge - up events in @xmath64 identical tp cycles is related to the abundance in the  zone ( partial mixing zone , pm ) by @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the masses of the dredged - up layer , the intershell zone covered by the he - flash convection and the envelope respectively . in low mass agb stars with core masses of @xmath69",
    "these quantities are of the order @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these masses vary from pulse to pulse and are dependent on the core mass and on the treatment of mixing .",
    "for example in the model sequence with rotation @xmath73 at a core mass of @xmath74 @xcite while in the sequence with overshooting at all convective boundaries @xmath75 at a core mass of @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath77 refers to the layer of the partial mixing zone that at the end of the interpulse phase contains  material . in models without mixing during the interpulse phase this corresponds to the region of the partial mixing zone were initially @xmath78 @xcite . in models with mixing during the interpulse like in the case with rotation",
    "the extent of the partial mixing zone can only be determined at the end of the interpulse when the calculation has yielded the s - process nucleosynthesis and mixing result .",
    "the factor @xmath79 describes the effect of overlapping he - flash convection zones in subsequent tp ( see below ) .    without resorting to the detailed results of full stellar evolution calculations we estimate the number @xmath64 of thermal pulses with dredge - up events that enrich the envelope in a semi - empirical way . as we have discussed in the introduction carbon stars",
    "are believed to be the result of recurrent third dredge - up events in low mass stars with initial zams masses predominantly in the range @xmath80 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these stars end their lives as white dwarfs with masses in the range @xmath81 , according to the revised stellar initial - final mass relation of @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mass distribution of white dwarfs peaks at or just below @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this mass distribution is very similar to that of central stars of planetary nebulae @xcite , which are in the evolution phase between agb stars and white dwarfs .",
    "this means that the majority of carbon stars must have achieved the necessary abundance enrichment through the third dredge - up before or when reaching a core mass of @xmath69 .",
    "according to the synthetic agb models of @xcite significant dredge - up must commence at core masses of @xmath83 or even below in some cases , in order to reproduce the carbon star luminosity function @xcite .",
    "therefore the relevant chemical enrichment of agb stars typically occurs within an effective core mass growth of about @xmath84 , and maybe up to 0.06@xmath85  in some cases . for low mass tp - agb stars the core mass growth per tp is about @xmath86 and with a dredge - up parameter of @xmath87 about m=7 ( @xmath88 ) and possibly up to 20 thermal pulses with dredge - up mixing ( if dredge - up starts at @xmath89 , @xmath90 )",
    "can be considered to be responsible for the abundance enrichment .",
    "expression eq.([math : mix ] ) does not take into account that processed heavy elements accumulate in the intershell from one tp to the next because the he - flash convection zone is partly overlapping ( overlap factor @xmath12 ) with layers that have been swept by the previous he - flash convection zone . in the case of nucleosynthesis of a species ( @xmath7 ) during the interpulse phase in a partial mixing zone the production stays roughly constant from tp to tp .",
    "the abundance due to such a production is @xmath91 . the total intershell abundance at the n@xmath92 tp with third dredge - up is then given by @xmath93 .",
    "the number @xmath94 of tps needed to approach a @xmath95 level of some asymptotic value for the intershell abundance of species s is given by @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath97 it follows that @xmath98 the overlap factor decreases as a function of tp number and also depends on the details of the third dredge - up efficiency .",
    "typically overlap factors in stellar models decrease from about @xmath99 at the earliest tps to an asymptotic value larger than @xmath100 .",
    "the condition @xmath97 is approximately satisfied for @xmath101 , for which eq.([gl : q ] ) returns @xmath102 .",
    "other triplets of @xmath103 are @xmath104 and @xmath105 . by evaluating eq.([math : mix ] ) for the numbers specified above , and with @xmath106 in eq.([math : mix ] ) given by using the maximum @xmath107 , we derive a logarithmic expression that relates the overabundance in the pm zone with the mass of that zone : @xmath108 where @xmath109 @xmath110 for @xmath111 @xmath112 . in figure[fig : tau - shsls ] we show the variation of log(@xmath113 ) and @xmath114_{pm}}}}$ ] with the neutron exposure .",
    "these trends have been obtained by fully implicit network calculations containing the s - process nucleosynthesis with neutron captures on all isotopes from he to pb ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and all relevant charged particle reactions ( see  [ sec : models ] for reaction rate references ) . as more neutrons are released the average  overabundance increases . in the current  model the partial mixing zone by definition does not extend into the he - burning shell , and therefore the partial mixing zone can not exceed the mass of the intershell layer .",
    "thus , the mass available for the pocket is @xmath115 .",
    "this , together with eq.([gl : sfe - mpm ] ) and @xmath111 requires that @xmath116 and translates into a minimum for @xmath117 in the partial mixing zone . in figure[fig : tau - shsls ] the left shaded part of the diagram with @xmath118 is thereby excluded as the predominant region of @xmath117 in the partial mixing zone .",
    "values of @xmath119 in that region would require a prohibitively large partial mixing zone ( @xmath120 ) in order to reproduce the most enriched stars of solar metallicity with @xmath121 . from [ hs / ls]@xmath122",
    "the @xmath117-values corresponding to the right shaded area in figure[fig : tau - shsls ] can be excluded as typical for the .",
    "in fact , if the neutron exposure values predominant in the pocket exceed @xmath123 mbarn@xmath124 the envelope  abundance will show [ hs / ls ] @xmath125 0 .",
    "this case is discussed in  [ sec : pp - ov ] with an example in table[tab : pocket - mass - test ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "to summarize , we estimate the following properties for the partial mixing zone in stars of solar metallicity :    * the @xmath4  pocket should generate a predominant neutron exposure in the range @xmath126 0.2 - 0.5 mbarn@xmath124 ; * using eq.([gl : sfe - mpm ] ) and @xmath127 , corresponding to the upper limit of @xmath117 , the mass of the partial mixing zone should obey @xmath128 ( assuming @xmath111 ) , in agreement with the detailed studies .",
    "stellar evolution models with rotation are computed in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "the 1d - hydrodynamical stellar evolution code @xcite considers angular momentum , the effect of centrifugal force on the stellar structure and the following rotationally induced transport mechanisms for angular momentum and chemical species : eddington - sweet circulation , solberg - hiland and goldreich - schubert - fricke instability , and dynamical and secular shear instability .",
    "the @xmath129-gradient , which acts as a barrier for rotationally induced mixing , and the ledoux criterion for convection and semi - convection are considered .",
    "the nuclear energy generation is computed in the operator split approximation with a network including pp - chain , h - burning cycles and he - burning . for comparison we analyze stellar models with hydrodynamic overshoot of @xcite .",
    "these models feature a partial mixing zone of protons and @xmath3  very similar to that assumed for  calculations with a parameterized partial mixing zone , like in @xcite .",
    "they assume however that overshoot is to some extent present at all convective boundaries .",
    "the two processes of rotation and overshoot are considered independently from each other as the stellar evolution models with rotation do not include overshoot and the overshoot models do not include rotation .",
    "the nuclear reactions under consideration for the  do not contribute in a significant way to the energy generation in the star .",
    "hence post - processing is a valid approximation and a faster and easier - to - handle alternative to re - computing the whole stellar evolution including all the needed nuclear species .",
    "an important feature of our rotating agb stellar models is a weak and persistent mixing of the partial mixing layer where the @xmath4  and @xmath5  pocket are located next to each other .",
    "the  can not be computed under the assumption of stratification anymore , as done for example by @xcite .",
    "therefore we have developed a nucleosynthesis and mixing post - processing code ( sbm6 ) which solves simultaneously for mixing processes , charged particle nuclear reactions as well as neutron production and destruction reactions and @xmath14-decays .",
    "the code uses thermodynamic and mixing properties of the stellar evolution models as input and follows the abundance evolution of the nuclear network described below . in the stellar evolution code with rotation the time and spatial resolution is determined by the h - burning shell .",
    "grid rezoning after the thermal pulse at the core - envelope interface may introduce some numerical diffusion which can be avoided if the s - process simulation is carried out on a fixed grid beginning right after the formation of the partial mixing zone . in the post - processing",

    "the solution scheme of coupled burning and mixing is fully implicit @xcite with adaptive time steps .",
    "a newton - raphson iteration is accepted as solution if the corresponding greatest relative correction is less than @xmath131 for any species at any grid point with a mass fraction @xmath132 .",

    "the neutron density typically encountered during the interpulse ( @xmath134 ) corresponds to @xmath135 . in practise",

    "hence , in models that consider overshoot at the base of the he - shell flash convection zone the neutron exposure in the  layer is higher than in models that do not include this overshoot .",

    "@xcite argued that overshoot of @xmath217 below the envelope of red giant stars could align the location of luminosity bump with observations .",
    "the 2d radiation - hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite have shown that the shallow surface convection zone of white dwarfs have exponential overshoot mixing according to an overshoot parameter of @xmath218 while the convection zone simulation of a - stars show @xmath219 .",

    "for the formation of the @xmath4  pocket and the  in tp - agb stars the most relevant rotationally induced mixing instability is caused by shear at locations of large angular velocity gradients . in order to anticipate rotationally induced mixing events it is therefore important to consider the angular velocity evolution throughout the thermal pulse cycle . throughout this and the following section we make use of the interpulse phase @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the time of the thermal pulse , i.e.  the peak he - burning luminosity , and @xmath237 is the interpulse period of @xmath238 .",

    "this region contains the h - shell ashes which have been deposited there by the outward burning h - shell .",
    "the angular velocity is larger in this area than in the convective envelope above the h - burning shell .",
    "angular momentum is efficiently distributed by convection throughout the convective envelope , which rotates almost rigidly .",

    "has formed and the mass layers covered by convection are spun up . at this time the he - flash convection zone reaches up to mass coordinate @xmath245 . between this and the following profile at @xmath246 the he - flash convection zone reaches its fullest extent up to @xmath241 ( just below the location of the h - burning shell before the thermal pulse ) . in addition , the intershell region is expanding due to the energy provided by the he - flash .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the angular velocity in the intershell .",

    "efficient shear mixing will take place at @xmath252 after the formation of the large angular velocity gradient .",
    "this gradient forms because two convective regions extend to this mass coordinates from below and above in short succession .",

    "rotationally induced shear mixing will be most efficient in acting on abundance gradients .",
    "the timescale to establish a partial mixing zone of hydrogen and @xmath3  as needed for the formation of the @xmath4  pocket is limited to the time interval when the envelope and the intershell are in contact , i.e. between the end of the third dredge - up and the reignition of the h - shell .",
    "this period lasts @xmath253 to @xmath254 ( figure[fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure[fig : ome - interpulse - fig ] the steep angular velocity gradient remains at this mass coordinate after the formation of the partial mixing zone and shear mixing at this location will persist throughout the intershell period .",
    "correspondingly , two mixing periods during the interpulse phase resulting from rotation can be distinguished as shown by the temporal evolution of the mixing coefficient presented in figure[fig : drot ] . during the initial envelope - core contact period at the end of the third dredge - up a partial mixing zone of protons and @xmath3  forms ( top panel , figure [ fig : rot - prof ] ) .",
    "the mixing efficiency in eulerian coordinates at this time is @xmath255 ( in cgs units ) , but decreasing rapidly at a time scale of @xmath256 .",
    "however , after the thermal pulse the mass gradient in the partial mixing zone increases steadily as the intershell layers contract and evolve towards a pre - flash structure . for assessing the effect on the abundance evolution the lagrangian mixing coefficient should be considered : @xmath257 where all symbols have their usual meaning .    in table[tab",
    ": dmdr ] we give the mixing properties in the partial mixing zone at three different times : an early phase soon after the pulse , a phase just before the release of neutrons starts , and a phase after the neutron source @xmath4  is exhausted . despite the comparatively large mixing coefficients rotationally induced",

    "finally , we note that the present model with rotation does not show sufficient third dredge - up .",
    "this has already been reported by @xcite and is evident from their fig.3 and 4 .",
    "we found that the third dredge - up in models of rotating agb stars is related to the efficiency of @xmath129-gradients to inhibit mixing .",
    "this is a somewhat uncertain parameterized property of rotating stellar models and a different approach in describing this effect could change the resulting third dredge - up .",

    "secondly , the @xmath5  and the @xmath4  pockets , which are well separated in the overshoot model , are effectively mixed . as a result",
    "the @xmath5abundance exceeds the @xmath4  abundance everywhere in the pocket ( middle panel , figure[fig : rot - prof ] ) .",
    "in this situation most neutrons released by @xmath4(@xmath19,n ) are absorbed by the reaction @xmath179 rather than by heavy nuclei . due to the increased amount of neutron absorbers",
    "the neutron density is drastically reduced ; the maximum neutron density is @xmath262 .",
    "this corresponds to the very small neutron exposure obtained in this model ( bottom panel , figure[fig : rot - prof ] ) .",
    "the activation of the @xmath179 reaction can be seen from the @xmath263 profile in the middle panel .",

    "[ sec : obs - pm ] we conclude that this particular model of rotational mixing in the tp - agb interpulse period can not produce the  abundance patterns observed in stars of solar metallicity .",
    "the neutron exposure reaches only @xmath264 , too small for any significant  enhancement .",

    "one peculiarity of  simulations including mixing throughout the interpulse period concerns the sensitivity to uncertainties of the nuclear reaction rates . in the parameterized  without mixing during the interpulse each layer is treated individually and all @xmath4is burnt before the onset of the next he - shell flash . as a result , for example a different @xmath43 rate ,",
    "as long as it allows all @xmath4  to be consumed during the interpulse period , would lead to a slight time shift of the neutron release , but in the end this does not affect the neutron exposure . the case with mixing throughout the interpulse",
    "is different due to the more important recycling of neutrons by @xmath179 and @xmath186 .",
    "for example , we find that the neutron exposure increases by about @xmath266 when using the nacre @xcite @xmath43 rate instead of the cf88 @xcite rate .    in summary",

    "both models do not seem to be consistent with the observed properties .",
    "the overshoot model shows some problems related to the overshoot at the base of the he - flash convection . the model including rotational mixing shows that the  during the interpulse is easily prevented if the delicate process of @xmath4  formation and neutron release is disturbed by mixing . in fact , our preliminary model of an agb star evolving from a main sequence star rotating more slowly than the model presented above indicates that also in this case the  nucleosynthesis during the interpulse period is very much inhibited by the rotation induced mixing .",
    "in the previous section we have encountered the limitations of both mixing processes , hydrodynamic overshoot and rotationally induced mixing . here",
    "we want to explore the possibility that some combination of both processes may provide a satisfactory mixing law for the . to that end",

    "test ` rot1 ` is computed by starting from the partial mixing zone obtained in the rotation sequence ( top panel , figure[fig : rot - prof ] ) , but excluding any further mixing during the interpulse .",
    "the maximum neutron exposure is @xmath268 , much higher than the case when mixing continues during the interpulse and very similar to that found in other partial mixing models without rotation .",
    "however , the neutron exposure integrated over the simulated mass range is two times smaller in test case ` rot1 ` compared to the case when the further mixing during the interpulse is included .",
    "this reflects the higher degree of n - recycling in a region of wider mass in the case when rotation mixing during the interpulse is included .",
    "test ` rot2 ` is computed by starting again from the partial mixing zone obtained in the rotation sequence and applying a constant eulerian mixing coefficient @xmath269 ( cgs units ) across the simulation range .",

    "we perform another set of simulations in which we start with the partial mixing layer produced from hydrodynamic overshoot ( shown in the top panel of figure[fig : ov - prof ] ) .",
    "a constant mixing coefficient is imposed during the interpulse simulation .",
    "cases for four different interpulse mixing efficiencies are shown in figure[fig : ovrot - tau ] .",
    "even with very weak constant mixing of @xmath272 the peak neutron exposure is somewhat reduced compared to the overshoot case without interpulse mixing shown in figure[fig : ov - prof ] . for",

    "the intershell @xmath3  abundance should be larger than in models that confine mixing in the he - shell flash convection zone strictly to within the schwarzschild boundaries .",
    "due to mixing during the interpulse phase the neutron release is modulated ( in any case reduced ) and a set of otherwise identical stars with a variety of mixing efficiencies at the core - envelope layers will display a spectrum of neutron exposures . in this scenario involving hydrodynamic overshoot as well as interpulse mixing ,",
    "the efficiencies needed to cover the spread in  efficiencies observed in stars @xcite and pre - solar grains @xcite can be achieved with mixing efficiencies of the order @xmath275 .",
    "this range is not currently reproduced by stellar evolutionary sequences including rotation , which predict much larger mixing efficiencies ( see  [ sec : m3r250 ] ) .",
    "smaller mixing efficiencies would result from a smaller angular velocity gradient at the core - envelope interface and/or a smaller rotation rate .",
    "this could be achieved by a more efficient angular momentum transport during the progenitor evolution .",
    "efficient third dredge - up and/or penetration of the convective pulse into the core might affect the mixing properties due to rotation as angular momentum could be transported out of the core into the envelope and carried away by mass loss .",
    "this effect is not present in our computation as our models do not show efficient third dredge - up .",
    "moreover , in our models we have not considered magnetic fields which could enhance the coupling of core and envelope and decelerate the core @xcite .",

    "the solar abundance is @xmath276 and observationally @xmath277 at the start of the agb phase ( average of k and m giants ) .",
    "the typical abundance of @xmath58 in tp - agb stars ( s , m and c stars ) is @xmath278 .",
    "in particular the n - type carbon stars show a large spread in @xmath58  abundances within a small range of c / o values .",
    "overall thermal pulses appear to cause a tenfold increase in @xmath58  as a result of thermal pulse and/or interpulse nucleosynthesis and third dredge - up . while the observed correlation of fluorine enhancement with s - process enhancement is reproduced by current models ( see figure 13 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed correlation of fluorine with carbon remains unsolved .",
    "several nucleosynthesis paths have been considered and the most likely involves a ( n , p ) reaction @xcite . because the @xmath279 rate is about ten times larger than the @xmath280 rate at @xmath281 @xcite @xmath46 can be excluded as the @xmath37-source for the required ( n , p)-reactions .",
    "even if fluorine is made during the interpulse period , massive agb stars can be excluded as @xmath58  producers because they have very hot he - flash convective zones , in which @xmath279 is very efficient . moreover , in massive agb stars , proton captures at the hot base of the convective envelope destroy fluorine efficiently .",
    "the @xmath4(@xmath19,n ) reaction is activated when the h - burning ashes are engulfed in the convection zone . however , the amount of neutrons released by the @xmath4   from the h - burning ashes is not enough to produce the required abundance of fluorine .",
    "another possible site for the production of fluorine is the nucleosynthesis occurring in the partial mixing zone during the interpulse periods .",
    "however , the partial mixing zone is typically unimportant with regards to the production of light elements because its mass is very small .",
    "in fact , the inclusion of the partial mixing zone in model calculations does not appear to increase the predicted surface abundance of @xmath58 .",
    "this conclusion can be drawn when comparing the abundance of @xmath58  at a given c / o ratio in figure 12 of @xcite , who studied fluorine production in agb stars including a parametric partial mixing zone , and in figure 14 of @xcite , who did not include a partial mixing zone in their study . here",

    "we assume that all @xmath139present in the intershell before the onset of the he - flash will be transformed into @xmath58  and no @xmath58  will be destroyed so that the intershell abundance at the time of the third dredge - up is @xmath286 , where @xmath287 . with eq.([math : mix ] ) , the observed abundances mentioned above , using q=2.3 , m=20 and the other numbers used in  [ sec : obs - pm ] , the total @xmath139production in the partial mixing zone during the interpulse phase must be of the order @xmath288 to cover the observational data .    in figure[fig : n15 ] we show some results for the @xmath139  production in the partial mixing zone . in the post - processing model of the sequence including rotation @xmath139  is produced by the reaction channels described above .",
    "the absolute amount is much smaller than needed .",
    "however , compared to a case with the same initial partial mixing zone but no interpulse mixing ( test case rot1 ,  [ sec : artmix ] ) the production of @xmath139  is larger by a factor @xmath289 .",

    "[ sec : artmix ] that combine an overshooting partial mixing zone with interpulse mixing of the  layer .",
    "we find that the @xmath139production increases with interpulse mixing reaching @xmath290 for @xmath291 .",

    "currently available observational data do not show this .",
    "renewed observational work on @xmath58  in agb stars is needed as well as more detailed models .",
    "in addition the question of reaction rate uncertainties has to be revised , in particular in the case of @xmath184 .",
    "we have compared two mixing processes for the  in low - mass agb stars .",
    "models that include overshoot at all convective boundaries feature neutron exposures that are larger than allowed to reproduce the observed  properties .",
    "this is due to the fact that overshoot at the base of the he - shell flash convection zone leads to intershell dredge - up of additional carbon from the core into the intershell layer .",
    "models that do not include overshoot at all convective boundaries ( and include the partial mixing zone in a parametric way ) feature neutron exposures that can explain only a small fraction of the observations .",
    "to explain the whole range of observational data some spread in the efficiency of the neutron release is required in the scenario of @xmath292c(@xmath19,n ) occurring in the interpulse periods . if rotation is included the  layer located at the core - envelope interface is continuously mixed throughout the interpulse period .",
    "the  layer is not stratified anymore and the @xmath4  pocket which forms at the end of the third dredge - up is polluted with the @xmath5  from layers in the partial mixing zone with an initially larger h/@xmath3  ratio . using the mixing law from a stellar evolution sequence of an initially rapidly rotating star the resulting neutron exposure is too small to allow any production of  elements .",
    "we have constructed synthetic models with a parameterized range of mixing efficiencies during the interpulse phase . in these models",
    "we find a spread of neutron exposures in the  layer .",
    "hence , we tentatively propose that the signature of rotationally induced mixing in agb stars might be identified with the observationally - inferred spread of neutron exposure in the interpulse .",
    "the spread of mixing efficiencies may be related to a spread of angular velocity gradients in stars of different initial rotational velocities , masses , or evolutionary status . however , mixing efficiencies which would correspond to the observed spread of neutron exposures are substantially lower than the mixing law in our stellar evolution model with rotation . in this scenario",
    "this might be attributed to some effect of angular momentum redistribution and loss due to a physical process missing in our calculations , such as efficient third dredge - up , mass loss and magnetic fields .    in the framework of the radiative interpulse  production site",
    "our simulations establish a relation between the intershell carbon abundance and the range of mixing efficiencies during the interpulse phase of agb stars . any mixing in the  layer during the interpulse phase and after the initial formation of the partial mixing zone can only reduce the final neutron exposure .",
    "a spectrum of slow mixing efficiencies during the interpulse phase can deliver a spread in neutron exposures in accordance with the observed spread of  indices if the neutron exposure in the limiting case without mixing is larger than the largest observationally required neutron exposure ( for example case @xmath293 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the carbon intershell abundance is larger than that obtained in models without hydrodynamic overshooting at the bottom of the he - flash convection zone , then the @xmath4  abundance in the pm zone and thus the neutron exposure will be larger as well . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : pp - ov ] agb models including this effect are in very good agreement with the observed carbon abundances of h - free and hot central stars of planetary nebulae , in which the progenitor agb intershell abundance is believed to be seen at the surface .    in this paper",
