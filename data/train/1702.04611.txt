    "given a pair of points in a smooth convex planar curve , its mid - line is the line that passes through its mid - point and the intersection of the corresponding tangent lines . if these tangent lines are parallel , the mid - line is the line through @xmath2 parallel to both tangents . when both points coincide , the mid - line is just the affine normal at the point .",
    "the envelope of mid - lines is an important affine invariant symmetry set associated with the curve .",
    "it is important in computer graphics and has been studied by many authors ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the envelope of mid - lines of planar curves can be divided into @xmath1 parts : the affine envelope symmetry set ( aess ) , corresponding to pairs with non - parallel tangent lines , the mid - points parallel tangent locus ( mptl ) , corresponding to pairs with parallel tangent lines , and the affine evolute , corresponding to coincident points .",
    "the concept of mid - line has a quite natural generalization to a hypersurface @xmath3 in the affine @xmath4-space : for a pair @xmath5 in @xmath3 , the _ mid - hyperplane _ is the affine hyperplane that passes through the mid - point @xmath2 of @xmath5 and the intersection of the tangent spaces at @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( note that this intersection is a co - dimension @xmath0 affine space ) .",
    "it is then natural to ask what is the structure of the envelope of mid - hyperplanes . in this paper",
    ", we study this set assuming that the tangent spaces at @xmath6 and @xmath7 are transversal ( for @xmath8 , this set is the aess ) .",

    "the envelope of mid - planes ( n=2 ) corresponding to coincident points is called affine mid - planes evolute and has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the aess is very well studied and coincides with the locus of center of conics having contact of order @xmath9 with the curve at @xmath0 points . moreover , if both contacts are of order exactly @xmath1 , the aess is regular ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in this article",
    "we prove that each point of the emh is the center of a conic having contact of order @xmath9 with the hypersurface at @xmath0 points .",
    "moreover , we describe a general conditition for the regularity of the emh that generalizes the regularity condition for curves .",
    "this general condition is algebraic , but we give geometric interpretations in some particular cases .",
    "the reflection property of the aess is very significant for symmetry recognition : if the aess is contained in a straight line @xmath10 , then the curve itself is invariant under an affine reflection with axis @xmath10 ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the reflection property does not extend to the emh .",
    "we give an example where the emh is contained in a plane ( n=2 ) but the surface @xmath3 is not invariant under an affine reflection . an interesting question here is to understand which kind of symmetry is implied by the inclusion of the emh in a hyperplane .",
