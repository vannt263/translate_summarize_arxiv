    "despite the fact that foundations of statistical mechanics were laid down in the nineteen century , the understanding that a single partition function can describe different phases of matter , is rather recent and indeed as late as 1930 s , there was not a consensus among physicists that one single partition function can describe ice , water and vapor @xcite or can give a sharp phase transition which we observe in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the works of kramers , wannier , onsager @xcite and others gradually established beyond doubt that in the thermodynamic limit , singular behavior and phase transition can arise from a single partition function based on a single model hamiltonian .",
    "for example the ising hamiltonian can describe both the ordered phase of a ferromagnet and the disordered phase of a paramagnet .",
    "however , the study of second order phase transition over the past decades , revealed an interesting feature which is called universality .",
    "it means that the near the point of second order phase transition , the details of the model hamiltonian do not matter and only some general properties like symmetries and dimension of the order parameter are important .",
    "+ our current understanding of this important phenomena , that is the independence of the most salient features of phase transition from the microscopic details is based on renormalization group ( rg ) and effective theories . under renormalization group ( change of scale ) , different microscopic theories tend toward an effective theory which describes the long range characteristics of a whole class of models , irrespective of their microscopic details",
    ". therefore if we imagine an infinite dimensional space in which all forms of hamiltonians describing the interactions of ising type variables are defined , there are some special points in this space , to which other models tend toward the rg flow .",
    "these fixed points essentially capture the most important properties of phase transitions of all the models along the rg trajectories .",
    "+ quite recently a new notation , different from universality , has emerged in the study of classical statistical mechanical models which is appropriately called completeness @xcite .",
    "the idea of completeness asserts that certain statistical mechanical models are complete in the sense that if the partition function of these complete models are solved , then the partition function of any other model can be also solved with a polynomial computational overhead .",
    "this new insight certainly is different from the notion of universality which applies only to the long distance limit of different theories .",
    "it takes into account the microscopic details of different models and yet claims that all these models are inherited from one single model .",
    "it is reminiscent of the concept of complete problems in computability theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the same space of coupling constants mentioned above , there are certain special points , from which a whole class of other models can be derived , in the sense that the partition function of the latter is exactly equal to the partition function of the complete model if we formulate the complete model on a sufficiently large lattice . + up until now many models have been shown to be complete @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the ising model which was the first to be proved complete @xcite .",
    "it is defined on a 2d rectangular lattice , with the following hamiltonian    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , the @xmath3 s are local magnetic fields which can be complex and all the interactions are nearest neighbors . + it is true that the model has no physical realization due to the complex fields and couplings , however it is quite significant that any other model , regardless of the nature of its statistical variables , dimensionality and even the geometry of its lattice , and the nature of its interactions is just an instant of this general computational problem .",
    "all the details of the original model , the couplings , the magnetic fields , the connectivity and geometry of the lattice are contained in the size of the 2d lattice and the inhomogeneous complex magnetic fields .",
    "+ almost all of these completeness results @xcite were derived by merging of ideas from statistical mechanics and quantum information theory @xcite.the new paradigm of measurement - based quantum computation ( mqc ) and the universality of cluster states for mqc @xcite was essential in these derivations .",
    "+ the starting point was the observation in @xcite that the partition function of any given discrete model can be written as a scalar product , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a product state encoding all the coupling constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 is an entangled _ graph _ state , defined on the vertices and edges of a graph , and encoding the geometry of the lattice .",
    "the core concept of completeness is the fact that the @xmath8 cluster state is universal .",
    "more concretely we know that the graph state @xmath9 corresponding to a graph @xmath10 can be obtained from an appropriate cluster state @xmath11 corresponding to a rectangular lattice ( denoted by @xmath12 ) , through a set of adaptive single - qubit measurements @xmath13 . the measurements being single - qubit can be formally written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a product state encoding the bases and the results which have been measured .",
    "thus the totality of measurements @xmath13 transforms the cluster state as follows @xmath16 which shows that after disregarding the states of the measured qubits @xmath15 , what is left is an appropriate graph state @xmath17 ) , leads to the completeness result mentioned above .",
    "that is one writes @xmath18 and notes that @xmath19 now encodes a set of generally inhomogeneous pattern of interactions on the cluster state .",
    "therefore one has @xmath20    however , there are two shortcomings in the above derivation .",
    "first it is an existence rather than a constructive proof , and one does not learn how to reduce any given statistical model to the 2d ising model , at least not in a simple way which we intend to introduce .",
    "second , it is not accessible to those who are not familiar with the concepts and techniques of quantum information theory , notably that of measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "while the result is a general one in statistical mechanics with potential intersect across many disciplines , its derivation is somewhat specialized .",
    "+ it is therefore the aim of our paper to provide a proof for this completeness result which is both constructive and accessible to a large audience and readership .",
    "we show how any model can be reduced to an instance of 2d ising model through a set of simple graphical transformation steps . as a by - product",
    "we also re - derive the well - known duality relations between various ising models , in a way which is different from the high and low temperature expansions .",
    "finally our proof does not require any basic knowledge of quantum information theory or mqc or even quantum mechanics .",
    "we hope that by providing this proof , we will make this important result accessible to a wide audience who can further explore the far - reaching consequence of the completeness of 2d ising model . + the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ( [ sec1 ] ) , we first review the basic result that any discrete statistical mechanical model can be expressed in terms of ising variables .",
    "we then show how the interaction terms of any such model can be transformed to the local magnetic fields of an ising model whose interaction strength is fixed at the value of @xmath0 . in section ( [ sec2 ] )",
    "we apply this idea to a few well - known examples and use it to derive the well - known results on duality in a way , which is independent from the high and low temperature expansions . in section ( [ com ] )",
    "we come to the main result of our paper , which is the proof of completeness of 2d ising model .",
    "we introduce basic transformation rules and express them in terms of diagrams ( with further examples in an appendix ) which allows us to transform any ising model on any kind of graph ( planar or not ) , to the 2d ising model on rectangular lattices .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion and the above mentioned appendix .",
    "consider an arbitrary discrete lattice model , like ising , potts , vertex or face model @xcite .",
    "the discrete variables of this lattice model need not be bi - valued like the ising model , and the lattice need not be regular .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the hamiltonian of such a model can always be re - written in terms of two - valued spin variables , in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a spin variable and @xmath23 are coupling constants .",
    "therefore the price that one pays for converting any type of variable to the ising variable is to admit few - body interactions in the hamiltonian in addition to two - body interactions . as two simple examples ,",
    "consider the the three - state and four- state potts model , whose variables @xmath24 take 3 or 4 different variables respectively , and their hamiltonians are given by : @xmath25 as shown in appendix a , by suitable encodings of the potts variables @xmath26 into a a pair of ising variables @xmath27 , we can turn these models into ising models on lattices of 2n sites .",
    "+ these two examples , illustrate the general idea of ( [ eq1 ] ) that by encoding any kind of discrete variables into a number of ising variables , one can turn any statistical model into an ising model , albeit with complicated multi - particle interactions .",
    "+ having this result , it is now enough to consider ising model on arbitrary graphs with arbitrary patterns of interactions .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a model is written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the strengths of one , two and three body interactions and @xmath32 stand for interactions of higher number of spins .",
    "we can now turn this hamiltonian into an equivalent one , containing only on - site interactions or local magnetic fields .",
    "the procedure is to define new spin variables as @xmath33 which turn the above hamiltonian into @xmath34 note that the variables @xmath35 are assigned to links , the variables @xmath36 to triangles and other variables to higher simplexes of the lattice .",
    "+ if all these new variables were independent , then the new hamiltonian would have been that of a collection of spins @xmath37 in local magnetic fields @xmath38 with a trivial partition function . however , the price that we should pay for this change of variable is that the new variables are not independent .",
    "in fact as we see , this price has the extra merit of paving the way for the proof of completeness result .",
    "there are many constraints between the new variables , for example we have @xmath39 in order to calculate the partition function in a correct way , one should take into account all these constraints .",
    "therefore the general form of the partition function will be @xmath40 in the above formula , @xmath41 denote a constraint and @xmath42 stands for the spin variables taking part in a constraint @xmath41 , and @xmath43 is a numerical factor which takes of overcounting . for simplicity of notation in what follows",
    "we denote the new variables @xmath44 with the ordinary variable @xmath45 .",
    "+ the basic idea is now to rewrite the constraints , which contain product of spins , in such a way to turn them into a form containing only two - body interactions , no matter how complicated the constraint is . to do this we introduce the following lemma : + @xmath46 for each constraint",
    ", we can add one single spin variable @xmath47 and write it as @xmath48 when inserted into the partition function , this produces extra magnetic fields @xmath49 on each spins @xmath50 , a magnetic field of @xmath51 on the extra spin @xmath47 and two - body interactions of strength @xmath52 between pairs of spins .",
    "the proof of lemma is very simple : + @xmath53 we use the variables @xmath54 defined as @xmath55 to write the constraint as @xmath56 now going to the original ising variables through the relation @xmath57 , converts this last relation to equation ( [ l1 ] ) , hence the lemma is proved .",
    "lemma ( [ l1 ] ) is depicted graphically in figure ( [ fig0 ] ) . for this and the other identities which are depicted in other figures",
    ", we will use a convention which we gather as follows : + * notations and conventions : * in all the equations and figures in this section , the boltzman factor @xmath58 has been absorbed in the hamiltonian , so @xmath59 means @xmath60 in all the equations .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 has the fixed value of @xmath0 . a spin which is summed over ,",
    "is depicted by a white circle .",
    "a gray circle means a spin whose value has been fixed to @xmath62 .",
    "every link indicates an interaction with a coupling strength of @xmath0 between its endpoints .",
    "the value written near any white circle is the value of the local magnetic field on this spin .",
    "when a @xmath63 or @xmath64 sign comes on the right hand side of a numerical value on spin , it means that the effect of summation over the white spin is , the addition or subtraction of that value to the local magnetic field of that spin .",
    "a white circle denotes a spin which is summed over .",

    ", width=264,height=132 ]    using this identity , the partition function of any model will be equivalent to the partition function of an ising model on a complex graph in which the coupling constants of all bilinear couplings is the constant value of @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that for any model which contain interactions of 2-body , 3-body up to a finite @xmath66 interactions , the number of constraints is polynomially dependent on the number of vertices of the original graph and hence the size of the final ising graph is only polynomially larger than the original graph .",
    "moreover our construction shows a specific algorithm for turning the original discrete model to an ising model with only @xmath0 interactions .",
    "we still have to show that the new ising model on the complex graph which may well be non - planar , is equivalent to a 2d ising model .",

    "this ising model , whose hamiltonian is in the form of ( [ i5 ] ) , is special in the sense that all its coupling constants are equal to the complex value of @xmath0 and all the coupling constants of the original model and all the details of the geometry of the original lattice , and the pattern of interactions are reflected into the local magnetic fields of the ising model .",
    "this completeness , was first proved @xcite by using concepts and techniques from quantum information theory and was based on the universality of cluster states .",
    "we have now proved this important result , by using independent and general concepts and methods which are accessible to a wide audience of researchers across many disciplines .",
    "in fact our method , not only unravels the essence of this completeness from a new perspective , it also provides an algorithmic approach through definite and simple graphical steps for reducing any other model to an ising model of the above type .",
    "the universal form of the ising model as shown in eq .",
    "( [ i5 ] ) , may have far reaching consequences .",
    "it shows that all the various models in different universality classes are different only in the number of sites and the pattern of local magnetic fields on this 2d lattice , and not on the nature of discrete variables , nor on the pattern of interactions .",
    "in particular the well - known criteria of dimensionality of the system and symmetry of the order parameter have to be re - interpreted in terms of the complete 2d ising model .",
