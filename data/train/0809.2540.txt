    "inflation has now become a standard paradigm to describe the physics of the very early universe , and as cosmological data keep improving , one can hope to get more and more clues about the very early universe .",
    "so far , the simplest models of inflation are compatible with the data but it is instructive to study more refined models for at least two reasons .",
    "first , because models inspired by high energy physics are usually more complicated than the simplest phenomenological inflationary models .",
    "second , because these generalized models will give us an idea of how much the future data will be able to pin down some specific region in parameter space .    in the first part of this contribution , we present a brief summary of the standard approach to compute the cosmological perturbations in the simplest inflationary models .",
    "this summary is mainly based on the pedagogical introduction @xcite where the reader will find more details .    in the second part",
    ", we show how the standard results are modified when several scalar fields play a role during inflation .",
    "we present recent results for very general multi - field inflationary models , allowing for non - standard kinetic terms .",
    "this generalization is motivated by efforts to connect string theory and inflation and we focus our attention on multi - field dbi ( dirac - born - infeld ) inflation .",
    "in this section , we consider the simplest inflationary models , which are based on a single scalar field @xmath0 governed by an action of the form s = d^4x(-12^_-v ( ) ) , where @xmath1 is the potential for the scalar field .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor is given by t_=__-g _",

    "the equation of motion for the scalar field is [ kg ] + 3h+v=0 . and",
    "the evolution of the scale factor is governed by friedmann s equations @xmath2    if the potential satisfies the so - called slow - roll conditions , _ v(vv)^2 1 , _ v^2 vv1 , where @xmath3 is the reduced planck mass , the evolution can enter into a _",
    "slow - roll inflationary regime _ where the kinetic energy of the scalar field in ( [ friedmann1 ] ) and the acceleration @xmath4 in the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) are negligible .    in order to study the linear cosmological perturbations",
    ", one must perturb the matter , i.e. the scalar field , as well as the geometry , i.e. the metric . restricting ourselves to scalar perturbations , the metric reads ds^2= -(1 + 2a)dt^2 + 2 a(t ) _ ib dx^idt+ a^2(t)dx^idx^j , where @xmath5 is directly related to the intrinsic curvature of constant time hypersurfaces , according to the relation ^(3)r=^2 .",
    "the metric perturbations are modified in a change of coordinates .",
    "it is thus useful ( although not necessary ) to define gauge - invariant coordinates , such as the curvature perturbation on uniform energy hypersurfaces , -+=- , or the comoving curvature perturbation , = -q , where @xmath6 is the scalar part of the momentum density ( @xmath7 ) . using the linearized einstein s equations",
    ", it can be shown that these two quantities are related via = -r-23(+p)(kah)^2where [ psi ] = + a^2 h ( -b / a ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is particularly interesting because it can be shown to be constant on large scales when the matter perturbations are adiabatic , i.e. when they satisfy p_nad p - p = 0 .",
    "this property , which is well - known for linear perturbations , can be seen as the consequence of a more general result . indeed , as shown in @xcite , the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor for any perfect fluid , characterized by the energy density @xmath9 , the pressure @xmath10 and the four - velocity @xmath11 , leads to the _ exact _ relation [ dot_zeta ] _ a_u_a= - ( _ a p - _ a ) , where we have defined _ a _ a-_a , = _ a u^a , = d , and where a dot on scalar quantities denotes a derivative along @xmath11 ( e.g. @xmath12 ) .",
    "this identity is valid for any spacetime geometry and does not rely on einstein s equations . in the cosmological context",
    ", @xmath13 can be interpreted as a non - linear generalization , according to an observer following the fluid , of the number of e - folds of the scale factor .",
    "introducing an explicit coordinate system and linearizing ( [ dot_zeta ] ) leads to the familiar result of the linear theory .    during inflation , it is easier to work with the perturbation @xmath14 , since in this case = + . because of the constraints arising from einstein s equations , the scalar metric perturbations and the scalar field perturbation are not independent . in fact , there is only one degree of freedom which can be expressed in terms of the combination v = a(+ ) a q , where @xmath15 represents the scalar field perturbation in the spatially flat gauge ( where @xmath16 ) .",
    "the quadratic action governing the dynamics of this degree of freedom can be obtained from the expansion up to second order of the full action .",

    "one considers @xmath18 as a quantum field and one decomposes it as [ fourier_quantum ] v ( , x)=1(2)^3/2d^3k \\{a_k v_k ( ) e^i k.x + a_k^v_k^ * ( ) e^-i k.x } , where the @xmath19 and @xmath20 are creation and annihilation operators , which satisfy the usual commutation rules [ a ] = ( k - k ) , = = 0 .",
    "the action implies that the conjugate momenta for @xmath18 is @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the canonical quantization for @xmath22 and its conjugate momentum leads to the condition v_k v_k^*-v_k^*v_k = i .",
    "[ wronskien ] the complex function @xmath23 satisfies the equation of motion v+ ( k^2- ) v=0 . in the slow - roll limit , @xmath24 , and",
    "one can use the solution for a de sitter spacetime ( where @xmath25 is constant ) . note that this is only an approximation as the hubble parameter is decreasing with time , but a very good one , when the slow - roll parameters are small , during the short time when the scale of interest crosses out the hubble radius ( @xmath26 ) . requiring that the solution on small scales behaves like",
    "the minkowski vacuum selects the particular solution v_ke^-ik ( 1-ik ) , where the normalization is imposed by the condition ( [ wronskien ] ) .",

    "q=|v_k|^2 , where the quantities on the right hand side are evaluated at _",

    "the effect of entropy modes is therefore potentially important in the perspective of confronting dbi models to future cmb observations .",
    "in this contribution , we have presented a general analysis of cosmological perturbations in multi - field inflationary models , allowing for non standard kinetic terms .",
    "this approach generalizes much more restrictive situations considered previously in the literature and is motivated by recent constructions of inflationary models in the context of string theory , where multiple fields and non standard kinetic terms are very common , a typical example being dbi inflation .    as we have tried to show , multi - field inflation is a very rich playground , where entropy modes can play a significant role . the most important consequence of entropy modes is the possibility to modify the curvature perturbation , on large scales , in contrast with single field inflation .",
