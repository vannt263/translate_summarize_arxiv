    "these galaxies are some of the brightest sources in the sub - millimetre wave - band and so are frequently called `` sub - millimetre galaxies '' ( smgs ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the dust emission in these luminous dusty galaxies has a rayleigh - jeans tail that produces a negative k - correction in the sub - millimetre wave - band , yielding a near constant flux density  luminosity dependence with redshift over the range @xmath1216 @xcite .",
    "although the volume density of the smg population evolves rapidly with redshift , ( showing a 1000-fold increase in the space density over the @xmath1310gyrs to @xmath62.5 ; @xcite ) , the volume density appears to subsequently decline above @xmath33 .",
    "this decline is not a result of a reduction in their apparent flux density in the sub - millimetre , but a real reduction in the volume density of smgs @xcite .",
    "however , determining the precise strength of the decline in the smg volume density requires locating the counterparts of high - redshift smgs .",
    "this is problematic due to the poor resolution of single dish sub - millimetre maps , which means that smgs have to be identified through correlations between their sub - millimetre emission and that in other wave - bands where higher spatial resolution is available ( usually the radio and/or mid - infrared e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these identifications are probabilistic as they rely on empirical correlations that have both significant scatter and which may evolve with redshift ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the seds in these other wave - bands have positive k - corrections and hence can miss the highest redshift counterparts . indeed in sub - millimetre surveys typically 3050% of smgs lack `` robust '' counterparts in the radio or mid - infrared , and these may represent an unidentified tail of high - redshift smgs ( e.g.  @xcite , see also @xcite ) . to circumvent this problem requires identifying smgs using sub-/millimetre interferometers ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but until recently their sensitivity has been too low to locate large numbers of smgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with the commissioning of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , we can now construct the large samples of precisely - located smgs needed to unambiguously study their properties and test galaxy formation models .",
    "whilst the bulk of the bolometric emission from smgs is radiated through continuum emission from dust grains in the rest - frame far - infrared , superimposed on this are a series of narrow atomic and molecular emission lines . by far the strongest of these arise from the atomic fine - structure transitions of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen in the far - infrared , along with weaker , but more commonly - studied molecular lines visible at millimetre wavelengths ( e.g.  @xmath14co , hcn ) .",
    "these bright emission lines are an important pathway by which the dense gas in these galaxies cools , and so provide a unique tracers of the star - formation process in these galaxies .    the brightest and best - studied of the atomic lines in the far - infrared is the @xmath15@xmath16 fine structure line of singly ionised carbon at 157.74-@xmath0 m ( here - after [ cii ] ) .",
    "much of the [ c ii ] emission from galaxies arises from the warm and dense photo - disassociation regions ( pdrs ) that form on the uv - illuminated surface of molecular clouds , although the [ cii ] flux from diffuse hii regions or from cool , diffuse interstellar gas can also be significant ( e.g.   * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the [ cii ] emission line therefore provides an indication of the gas content and the extent of the gas reservoir in a galaxy .",
    "far - infrared surveys of low - redshift galaxies from the kuiper airborne observatory and _ iso _ have shown that the [ cii ] line can comprise @xmath17% of the total bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "this bright line is thus ideally suited for deriving redshifts for obscured galaxies and investigating their dynamics and star - formation properties .",
    "early searches for [ cii ] , by necessity , focused on the highest - redshift far - infrared sources , @xmath184 , where the [ cii ] line is shifted into the atmospheric windows in the sub - millimetre ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these sources host powerful agn ( as well as being ulirgs ) and it was noted that their [ cii ] lines were weak relative to @xmath5 , demonstrating the same behavior as seen in agn - dominated ulirgs in the local universe . however , more recent observations of the [ cii ] emission in high redshift star - formation dominated ulirgs has shown that the [ cii ] emission can be as bright as in local , low - luminosity galaxies , @xmath4}$]/@xmath190.11% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this has been interpreted as due to the lower ionisation field arising from more widely distributed star - formation activity within these systems , in contrast to the compact nuclear star formation seen in low - redshift ulirgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of [ cii ] ( and other atomic lines ) , and its relative strength to the far - infrared luminosity can therefore be used to probe the physical properties of the interstellar medium in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we have recently undertaken an alma cycle 0 study at 870@xmath0 m ( 345ghz ) of the 126 sub - millimeter sources located in the 0.5@xmath20@xmath210.5@xmath20 laboca extended _ chandra _ deep field south survey ( `` less '' ; @xcite ) , the most uniform sub - millimetre survey of its kind to date .",

    "observations of the 126 sub - millimeter sources in the less survey were obtained with alma at 345ghz ( band 7 ) with a dual polarisation setup in the compact configuration , yielding a synthesised beam of @xmath131.8@xmath271.2@xmath23 .",

    "we examine whether there is any evidence for velocity structure by comparing the spatial distribution of the integrated [ cii ] emission between @xmath332100kms@xmath11 and 0210kms@xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath31fwhm relative to the systemic redshift in the continuum subtracted cube ) . by centroiding the two maps we derive a spatial offset of 3.3@xmath311.7kpc between the redshifted and blue - shifted emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "although tentative , this spatial extent is similar to the [ cii ] spatial extent of the bright @xmath65 smg hdf850.1 where similar data are available @xcite , and also to the high-@xmath34 @xmath14co molecular emission fwhm ( @xmath134kpc ) from a sample of eight smgs at @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "if the spatial offset in aless65.1 represents rotating gas , then we estimate a mass m@xmath363.5@xmath2110@xmath37sin@xmath38 , which is consistent with the implied gas and stellar mass estimates .      since our alma survey has followed up _ all _ of the less smgs , we can use the detection rate to investigate the evolution of the [ c ii ] luminosity function . in the following",
    "we assume that all of the [ cii]-emitting galaxies in the @xmath39=0.12 volume covered by our observations were detected and so we stress that these calculations yield only a lower - limit on the volume density of high - redshift [ cii]-emitters .    to estimate the @xmath120 [ cii ] luminosity function , we start from the @xmath120 far - infrared luminosity function of @xcite and initially assume a constant @xmath40}$]/@xmath5=0.002 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : cii_lf ] , including the expected dispersion due to the scatter in the local @xmath4}$]/@xmath41@xmath5 relation .    to assess the reliability of this @xmath60 [ cii ] luminosity function we attempt to independently derive this using the @xcite study of [ cii ] emission in a sample of 227 @xmath420.05 galaxies from the _ iso _ archive .",
    "the parent population of this study can be approximated by an _ iras _",
    "100-@xmath0 m selected sample at @xmath420.05 with flux densities between s@xmath4311000jy .",
    "there are @xmath1311,000 _ iras _ sources within this redshift and flux density range and so we must account for the incompleteness in the @xcite sample to derive the @xmath440 [ cii ] luminosity function .",
    "we start by assuming the @xcite sample is a random subset of the parent population ( although we note it is likely that apparently bright sources are over - represented in the sample , and fainter sources correspondingly under - represented ) .",
    "we then only consider _ iras _ sources with flux densities @xmath4510jy where the fraction of galaxies observed in the @xcite sample is @xmath73% of the parent population and then calculate the fraction of galaxies in the @xcite sample compared to the number of _ iras _ galaxies at @xmath420.05 in bins of 100-@xmath0 m flux density and redshift .",
    "we use these sampling fractions to correct the apparent [ cii ] luminosity function within @xmath420.05 ( a comoving volume of 0.035gpc@xmath46 ) and show these data in fig .",
    "[ fig : cii_lf ] .",

    "to place the new alma - identified @xmath1=4.4 smgs on this plot , we estimate the volume covered by our observations of ecdfs by considering that the brightest [ cii ] emitters will correspond to the brightest far - infrared sources ( i.e.  smgs ) . the less smgs",
    "are located within a 0.5@xmath470.5@xmath20 region and assuming our alma observations cover the [ cii ] with a redshift range of @xmath39=0.12 at @xmath64.4 , we derive a comoving volume of 2.9@xmath2110@xmath48mpc@xmath49 . finding two galaxies in this volume with [ cii ] luminosities",
    "@xmath451@xmath2110@xmath50l@xmath51 indicates a @xmath71000 factor increase in the number density of luminous [ cii ] emitters from @xmath1204.4 .",
    "this is equivalent to a @xmath1334@xmath21 [ cii ] luminosity evolution between @xmath1=04.4 which is consistent with the evolution in the far - infrared luminosity function ( factor @xmath133@xmath21 in @xmath41 for a fixed volume density of @xmath52=10@xmath53mpc@xmath11 ; @xcite ) between @xmath1=0 and @xmath1=3 , although since the far - infrared luminosity function declines beyond @xmath1=3 , the [ cii ] luminosity function may peak at lower redshift than probed by our observations here .",
    "we have undertaken an alma study of 126 sub - millimetre sources from the laboca 870@xmath0 m survey of the ecdfs @xcite .",
    "we focus here on two high - redshift smgs that are precisely located by our high resolution alma continuum observations and whose alma spectra detect bright emission lines .",
    "we interpret these lines as the far - infrared atomic fine structure line [ cii]157.74 , indicating redshifts of @xmath1=4.4 for both galaxies .",
    "we show that the ratio of @xmath54}$]/@xmath5 is higher than comparably luminous galaxies at @xmath1=0 , but consistent with the ratio seen in other high - redshift ulirgs .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that the molecular emission is extended and indeed , in one of our smgs our data suggest that the [ cii ] is resolved on @xmath73kpc scales . given the volume probed by our observations , we show that the [ cii ] luminosity function must evolve strongly across the 12gyrs between @xmath1=0 and @xmath64 .",
