    "multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( mwnts ) consist of graphene sheets wrapped up to form a series of concentric cylindrical shells@xcite .",
    "the number of shells @xmath0 in a mwnt ranges from 2 to more than 100 , and they mutually interact via van der waals ( vdw ) forces . of interest is the feature that internal structures of mwnts , like differences in diameters and chiralities between consecutive shells , are responsible for electronic@xcite and optical@xcite properties of the systems .",
    "therefore , better understandings of their cross - sectional deformation driven by external forces would be important for developing various mwnt - based applications involving sensors@xcite and actuators @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most of earlier studies have dealt only with single - walled carbon nanotubes , in which simple radial collapse under pressures of the order of a few gpa was observed @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the core - shell structure of a mwnt is expected to enhance its radial stiffness , as restoring forces exerted on pairs of neighboring shells buffer against cross - sectional deformation .",
    "this conjecture is , nevertheless , not obvious when @xmath1 . for the latter case ,",
    "outside shells have large diameters that lead to mechanical instability , whereas inside shells keep the radial rigidity due to their small diameters .",
    "such the discrepancy in the radial stiffness between outside and inside shells implies a new class of cross - sectional deformation induced by hydrostatic pressure .",
    "another interesting issue is the radial and circumrerential stiffness of mwnts embedded in an elastic medium .",
    "when applying an external force to the host medium of elastic composite embedding mwnts , then a restoring force acts on the outermost surface of mwnts",
    ". this restoring force will tend to remain the circular geometry of the outermost shell of each dispersed mwnt ; this is in contrast with the previous case where the outermost shell become softened .",
    "exploring the cross - sectional morphology of embedded mwnts will provide useful information for developing nanofluidic @xcite or nanoelectrochemical @xcite devices whose performance depend crucially on the geometry of the inner hollow cavity of nanotubes .    in this article , we analytically demonstrate the characteristic cross - sectional morphology of mwnts with and without embedded elastic medium under external pressure .",
    "a two - dimensional plane strain model is developed , assuming no variation of load and deformation along the tube axis .",
    "it has been found that the existence of the surrounded elastic medium crucially affect the cross - sectional shape under buckling state .",
    "some examples on the interesting cross - sectional shapes are introduced and brief discussions on these phenomena are also given .",
    "we have employed the continuum model of mwnts@xcite that enables to deduce the stable cross - sectional geometry under pressure .",
    "though atomistic simulations are realistic and accurate , the computational cost associated is huge .",
    "this has encouraged the use of continuum models in various fields to study mechanical properties of mwnts , together with discussions on the validity of the models@xcite .    in the continuum model",
    ", a mwnt is mapped onto a set of @xmath0 concentric cylindrical shells with thickness @xmath2 , wherein the @xmath3th shell has the radius @xmath4 .",
    "the mechanical energy @xmath5 of a mwnt per unit axial length is written as @xmath6 the first term @xmath7 represents the deformation energy , in which @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the extensional strain of a circumferential line element ; @xmath10 is a radial coordinate measured from the centroidal curve of the @xmath3th shell , @xmath11 is a circumferential coordinate , and @xmath12 with the young modulus @xmath13 tpa and poisson s ratio @xmath14 of mwnts .",
    "the second term @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_01 ] ) is the interaction energy of all adjacent pairs of shells described by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 describes the radial deformation of the @xmath3th shell , and the summation is taken for all neighboring pairs of @xmath18 .",
    "the vdw interaction coefficients @xmath19 are functions of @xmath4 and @xmath20 as proved in ref .  .",
    "the final term @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_01 ] ) is the negative of the work done by the external pressure @xmath22 during cross - sectional deformation ; it is expressed as@xcite @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the area surrounded by the @xmath0th shell after deformation .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath22 is assumed to be positive inward .",
    "the stable cross - sectional shape of a mwnt under pressure @xmath22 is deduced by applying the variation method to @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_01 ] ) with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath25 @xcite",
    ".    when the outermost surface of mwnts is surrounded and perfectly bonded by an elastic medium , the strain energy @xmath26 should be added @xcite in the total mechanical energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_01 ] ) ; here @xmath27 is the deformation of the surface in the circumferential direction , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are radial and circumferential normal stresses in the elastic medium , caused by the deformation of the nanotube surface , respectively .",

    "are almost uniformly deformed so that consecutive shells are equally spaced even after deformation .",
    "this behavior becomes more clear by plotting the normalized deformation amplitudes of individual concentric shells as given in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_01 ] ( c ) . by increasing @xmath0",
    ", we obtain qualitatively different results as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where the cross - section yields a corrugation mode of @xmath37 . in the latter mode ,",
    "outside shells exhibit significant deformation , while the innermost shell maintains its cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we point out that the persistence of cylindrical symmetry of the innermost shell will be useful in developing nanotube - based nanofluidic @xcite or nanoelectrochemical devices @xcite , as both utilize the hollow cavity within the innermost shell .",
    "in fact , manifold class of intercalated molecules can fill the innermost hollow cavities of nanotubes @xcite , which trigger intriguing behaviors distinct from those of the corresponding bulk systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , the innermost shell of mwnts in the radial corrugation mode serves as an ideal protective shield for the intercalates , since it maintains its cylindrical geometry even under high external pressure .",
    "figure [ fig_02 ] ( a ) and [ fig_02 ] ( b ) show two corrugation modes for mwnts surrounded by an elastic medium with @xmath38 gpa and @xmath39 ; figure [ fig_02 ] ( c ) indicates plots of relative deformation amplitude for the embedded case . from here we can see two characteristic tendencies which is not shown in the case of no elastic medium described in the previous section .",
    "first , corrugation mode exhibits in not only outside but also inside shells for a mwnt with @xmath40 .",
    "second , the corrugation mode that remain its cylindrical symmetry is shown for @xmath41 , however , the deformation amplitude of the outermost shell is not always largest .",
    "this fact says that an embedded elastic medium may cause  inner tube instability \" .     and",

    "( c ) plots of relative deformation amplitudes.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]",
    "it has been found that in radial corrugation modes , large discrepancy in the deformation amplitudes between the outer and inner shells perturb the equal spacing between the concentric shells of the original mwnts . in",
    "no embedded elastic medium cases , the cross - sectional shapes of inner shells maintain circle or oval .",
    "on the other hand , an embedded medium may cause inner shell corrugation modes especially when the number of shells for mwnts is small .",
    "such the modulation in inter - shell spacing will affect electronic and vibrational properties of the entire nanotube , thus triggering a change in its electronic and thermal conductance .",
    "we also conjecture that those pressure - induced changes in physical properties of mwnts are of practical use for developing mwnt - based pressure sensors .",
    "it is particularly hoped that our results should be verified by high - pressure experiments on mwnts as well as atomic - scale large - scale simulations @xcite .    before closing",
    ", it deserves comments on the relevance of our results to quantum transport of low - dimensional nanostructures .",
    "it is theoretically known @xcite that quantum particles moving along a thin curved surface behave differently from those on a conventional flat plane , since nonzero geometric curvature results in an effective electromagnetic field @xcite . in this",
    "context , quantum transport of electrons moving in mwnts under pressure will exhibit non - trivial surface curvature effects , though details are to be explored .",
