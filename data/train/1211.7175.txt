    "in the standard framework of three massive neutrinos , the parameters which describe neutrino oscillation phenomena are three mixing angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , a cp phase @xmath3 , and two mass squared differences @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) and ( @xmath7 , @xmath0 ) were determined by the experiments of atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos , and by those of solar and long baseline reactor neutrinos , respectively@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 was determined recently by the two accelerator neutrino experiments , t2k@xcite and minos@xcite and by the three reactor neutrino experiments , double - chooz@xcite , daya bay@xcite and reno@xcite .",
    "the results of the global analysis are given in refs.@xcite .",
    "the quantities which are not yet determined are the pattern of mass hierarchy ( in other words the sign of @xmath8 ) , the cp phase @xmath3 and the octant of @xmath1 ( in other words the sign of @xmath9 ) . from @xmath10 .",
    "however , we need more statistics before we draw any conclusion . ]",
    "the next things to do is to determine the pattern of mass hierarchy and the octant of @xmath1 , before we achieve the final goal of the neutrino oscillation study , i.e. , measurement of the cp phase @xmath3 .",
    "these tasks are expected to be done in the future experiments .",
    "these experiments include so - called super beam experiments ( such as no@xmath11a@xcite , t2k phase 2@xcite , lbne@xcite , lbno@xcite ) , in which neutrinos are produced in pion decays , a neutrino factory@xcite , in which neutrinos are produced in muon decays , or a beta beam@xcite , in which neutrinos are produced in beta decays of radioactive isotopes .",
    "in the accelerator neutrino experiments , the appearance oscillation probabilities @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the case of a neutrino factory and a beta beam ) are measured , and one would naively expect that the oscillation probabilities of these two channels are sufficient to determine the cp phase @xmath3 .",
    "it is known , unfortunately , that even if the values of the oscillation probabilities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are exactly given , we can not determine uniquely the values of the oscillation parameters due to eightfold parameter degeneracy .",
    "this eightfold parameter degeneracy@xcite consists of three kinds of degeneracies , the intrinsic degeneracy@xcite , the sign degeneracy@xcite ( @xmath16 ) and the octant degeneracy@xcite ( @xmath17 ) .    to see the eightfold degeneracy , it is convenient for the plot to give eight different points for different eight solutions . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that the solution specified by @xmath18 const . and @xmath19 const .",
    "gives a quadratic curve ( a hyperbola in most cases ) in the @xmath20 plane . in fig.[fig:1",
    "] , @xmath21 const . and @xmath22 const .",
    "gives two different quadratic curves ( due to the sign degeneracy ) depending on the pattern of mass hierarchy , and each curve in general has two intersections ( due to the intrinsic degeneracy ) with one of two horizontal lines @xmath23 ( two lines appear due to the octant degeneracy ) .    _ the eight - fold degeneracy in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "when the two probabilities @xmath24 const . and @xmath25 const .",
    "are given , it gives us a quadratic curve for each mass hierarchy .",
    "nh ( solid ) and ih ( dashed ) stand for normal ( @xmath26 ) and inverted ( @xmath27 ) hierarchy , respectively . _ ]    _ the allowed regions at best - fit ( the shaded area bounded by the thin quadratic curve ) and at 90%cl ( the wider area bounded by the thick quadratic curves and the line @xmath28 ) from the t2k appearance result@xcite .",
    "the regions bounded by solid ( dashed ) curves are for normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "the horizontal ( vertical ) band @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) bounded by thick straight lines stands for the allowed region at 90%cl of the atmospheric ( reactor ) neutrino experiments , respectively .",
    "the horizontal ( vertical ) thin straight line(s ) @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) stand for the best - fit value(s ) for the atmospheric ( reactor ) neutrino data . _ ]     _ the dependence of the value of the cp phase @xmath34 which is obtained with a wrong ansatz with respect to the intrinsic , sign and octant degeneracies as a function of the true value of @xmath3 from the t2k appearance results on @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 is assumed .",
    "_ ]    each quadratic curve in fig.[fig:1 ] shrinks to a straight line when the experiment is performed at the oscillation maximum @xmath39 , and this is the case at the t2k experiment .",
    "however , the present result@xcite is for the neutrino mode @xmath35 only , and @xmath21 const . gives the inside of the region bounded by some quadratic curve ( the shaded area bounded by the thin quadratic curve in fig.[fig : t2k ] ) , instead of a straight line .",
    "since the t2k result comes with the experimental error , the allowed region at 90 % cl becomes ( bounded by the thick quadratic curve and the line @xmath28 ) much wider than that by the best - fit value in fig.[fig : t2k ] .    in the future the t2k experiment will measure both @xmath40 and @xmath41 with intense neutrino beams , and the error is expected to be reduced . even with the reduced error , however , it is not obvious whether parameter degeneracy can be resolved .",
    "it turns out that the sign degeneracy is most serious to determine @xmath3 .",
    "this can be seen from fig.[fig:2 ] , where the value of @xmath42 , which is obtained with a wrong ansatz with respect to the intrinsic , sign , and octant degeneracies , respectively , is plotted as a function of the true value of @xmath43 in the case of t2k setup for @xmath37 and @xmath44 .",
    "since the sign degeneracy can be lifted with a long baseline experiment with a baseline length @xmath45 1000 km because of a large matter effect , it is expected to be resolved by future experiments with very long baselines .",
    "it is expected that the accelerator long baseline experiments with intense neutrino beams will enable us not only to measure precisely the oscillation parameters of the three flavor framework but also to probe new physics by looking for deviation from the standard scenario with three massive neutrinos .",
    "in particular , at accelerator neutrino experiments with high energy neutrinos we can study the channels @xmath47 and @xmath48 with opera - like detectors .",
    "these experiments include the minsis proposal  @xcite , in which the numi beam is used to look for @xmath46 at short baseline , and a neutrino factory@xcite .",
    "is expected to be difficult in this scenario . however , @xmath46 detection may be possible in a future extension to the high energy neutrino factory . ]",
    "these channels are expected to give stronger constraints on new physics than those which are obtained by the present experiments . here",
    "i will describe a few examples of new physics , where @xmath46 detection can improve on the limits .",
    "let us suppose that a non - standard interaction @xmath49 exists due to new physics , where @xmath50 is the coefficient of the non - standard interaction , normalized in terms of the weak scale , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are neutrinos and charged leptons of flavor @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 stand for fermions ( the only relevant ones are electrons , u and d quarks ) .",
    "then this interaction predicts the exotic reactions such as @xmath56 or @xmath57 in the process of production and detection of neutrinos@xcite .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath58 has been investigated by several groups . among others ,",
    "@xcite showed that the sensitivity of a neutrino factory to @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is excellent . by various experiments . ]",
    "it is known  @xcite that in generic see - saw models the kinetic term gets modified after integrating out the right handed neutrino and unitarity is expected to be violated . in the case of the so - called minimal unitarity violation , in which only three light neutrinos are involved and sources of unitarity violation are assumed to appear only in the neutrino sector , unitarity violation is strongly constrained .",
    "its constraint mostly comes from the bounds of rare decays of charged leptons , and deviation from unitarity is smaller than @xmath61(1% )  @xcite .",
    "when the mixing matrix @xmath62 is nonunitary , deviation from unitarity is expressed as @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite studied sensitivity to @xmath64 at a neutrino factory , and the bound is stronger than that of the present one from @xmath65 .",
    "the anomaly which was announced by the lsnd group@xcite would imply mass squared difference of @xmath61(1 ) ev@xmath66 if it is interpreted as a phenomenon due to neutrino oscillation @xmath67 .",
    "the standard three flavor scheme has only two independent mass squared differences , i.e. , @xmath68ev@xmath66 ( @xmath69ev@xmath66 ) for the solar ( atmospheric ) neutrino oscillation .",
    "to accommodate a neutrino oscillation scheme to the lsnd anomaly , therefore , the extra state should be introduced .",
    "this extra state should be sterile neutrino , which is singlet with respect to the gauge group of the standard model , because the number of weakly interacting light neutrinos should be three from the lep data@xcite . to test the lsnd anomaly ,",
    "the miniboone experiment has been performed , but their results@xcite seem to be inconclusive . on the other hand , the flux of the reactor neutrino was recalculated in ref.@xcite and it was claimed that the normalization is shifted by about + 3% on average .",
    "this claim is qualitatively consistent with an independent calculation in ref.@xcite .",
    "if their claim on the reactor neutrino flux is correct , then neutrino oscillation with @xmath701ev@xmath66 may be concluded from a re - analysis of 19 reactor neutrino results at short baselines@xcite . this is called reactor anomaly .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that the measured and predicted @xmath71ge production rates differ in the gallium radioactive source experiments gallex and sage , and this is called gallium anomaly",
    ". the anomalies of lsnd , reactor and gallium constitute the main motivation for study of sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "sensitivity to sterile neutrino mixing at the minsis proposal was studied in ref.@xcite , and it was shown that minsis can improve on the current bound by a factor 100 for the @xmath47 channel . in a neutrino scheme with one sterile neutrino state , there are three cp phases , and it was shown in ref.@xcite that the largest cp violation can potentially occur in the @xmath47 channel with the present constraints from other experiments . recently a project called nustorm@xcite was proposed as a low energy prototype for a neutrino factory . although the low energy neutrino beam of nustorm does not allow us to create @xmath72 s , it has a good sensitivity to the sterile neutrino mixing angles .",
    "in the standard framework of three massive neutrinos , all the three mixing angles have been determined , and the remaining quantities to be measured are the sign of @xmath8 , the sign of @xmath9 , and the cp phase @xmath3 .",
    "these quantities are expected to be determined in the future experiments , by resolving parameter degeneracies .",
    "if the neutrino energy is sufficiently high as in the minsis proposal or the high energy option of a neutrino factory , then one can detect @xmath46 with an opera - like detector . in this case",
    ", we can probe new physics , such as non - standard interactions , unitarity violation , or light sterile neutrino scenarios , so @xmath46 detection in neutrino oscillations deserves further study .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for invitation and hospitality during the workshop .",
    "this research was partly supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research of the ministry of education , science and culture , under grant no .",
