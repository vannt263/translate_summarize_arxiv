    "our modern understanding of solar internal dynamics rests heavily on global and local helioseismology , with perspective provided by theoretical and numerical models .",
    "this perspective is particularly important in the deepest regions of the convection zone where mean flows are established and where helioseismic probing is most challenging .",
    "the most reliable result from helioseismology with regard to the dynamics of the deep convection zone ( cz ) continues to be the solar internal rotation profile obtained from global inversions @xcite .",
    "such inversions indicate that the monotonic surface differential rotation ( @xmath3% decreases in angular velocity @xmath4 from equator to pole ) persists throughout the convection zone with little radial variation .",
    "further dynamical clues come from estimates of the meridional flow near the surface inferred from local helioseismic inversions and photospheric observations @xcite .",
    "although various measurement techniques can yield disparate results for the radial and temporal dependence of the meridional flow , all techniques generally agree that there is a persistent poleward flow near the surface ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the solar radius ) from the equator up to latitudes of at least 60 - 70@xmath7 , with an amplitude of 10 - 20 m s@xmath0 .",
    "less is known about the structure or amplitude of convective flows in the deep convection zone .",
    "photospheric observations are dominated by solar granulation , with a velocity scale of @xmath8 2 km s@xmath0 and a size scale of @xmath9 1 mm , but deep convective motions are thought to be much slower and larger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "closer scrutiny of the photospheric velocity power spectrum obtained from doppler measurements shows a prominent peak near a spherical harmonic degree @xmath10 , corresponding to a size scale of 30 - 35 mm and a spectral velocity amplitude of 7 - 8 m s@xmath0 @xcite . however ,",
    "this observed spectral amplitude is significantly lower than the true amplitude of the convection due mainly to projection effects ; the doppler measurements trace mainly horizontal flows near the limb . taking projection and other sampling effects into account ( e.g. spatial and temporal filtering ) , hathaway et al .",
    "were able to match the observed spectrum near @xmath10 with a supergranular flow component having a typical velocity amplitude of about 300 - 400 m s@xmath0 , in agreement with the correlation tracking of surface features @xcite .",
    "the power declines steadily toward lower @xmath11 , where one would expect to see signatures of deep convection ( giant cells ) .",
    "thus , either giant cells have a lower amplitude than supergranulation , or they do not imprint through to the photosphere ( or both ) .",
    "@xcite have recently searched for signatures of subsurface convection in local helioseismic inversions at depths of 0.92@xmath6 , 0.95@xmath6 , and 0.96@xmath6 .",
    "their analysis indicates that the spectral velocity amplitude at these depths is less than 10 m s@xmath0 and possibly less than 1 m s@xmath0 for convective motions with @xmath12 and correlation times longer than 96 hours .",
    "this is one to two orders of magnitude lower than suggested by convection simulations and mixing length theory ( see  [ sec : models ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we argue that these results , if confirmed , would have important implications for the maintnance of mean flows in the sun . in particular , we use fundamental physical arguments together with solar observations to derive lower bounds on the amplitude of convective motions in the deep solar interior .",
    "these estimates are based on robust dynamical balances deduced from the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "they are not based on mixing length theory and they do not depend on any results from numerical simulations , although they are consistent with both (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "we find that the amplitude of convective motions in the upper convection zone ( @xmath13 ) must be at least 30 m s@xmath0 in order to be capable of sustaining the mean flows inferred from helioseismology .",
    "similar estimates for the lower cz ( @xmath14 ) imply that convective motions there must be at least 8 m s@xmath0 . reconciling these lower limits with the upper limits found by @xcite",
    "is a challenge for global convection models but may be possible if the motions responsible for maintaining mean flows span multiple scales , with significant power above @xmath15 .    in  [ sec : meanflows ] we discuss how differential rotation and meridional circulation are maintained in the sun by means of the convective reynolds stress , baroclinicity , and their own inertia .",
    "this provides a link between convection and mean flows that we exploit in ",
    "[ sec : amp ] to obtain lower limits on the amplitude of convective motions in the deep convection zone . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we address the length scale of convective motions and the implications of our velocity and length scale estimates for helioseimic probing , flux - transport dynamo models , and convection models . section [ sec : summary ] is a summary of our principle results and conclusions .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum for a statistically steady flow in a rotating spherical shell may be expressed as follows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mh11 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass density , @xmath18 is the specific angular momentum , @xmath4 is the rotation rate , @xmath19 is the cylindrical radius , and @xmath20 is the mean meridional flow .",
    "this equation is derived by averaging the zonal momentum equation over longitude and time , with averages denoted by angular brackets @xmath21 .",
    "spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are used throughout .    the @xmath25 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) is a net axial torque that includes contributions from the reynolds stress , the lorentz force , and the viscous diffusion .",
    "explicit expressions are given in mh11 .",
    "the molecular viscosity is small in stars so viscous diffusion can be safely neglected .",
    "neglecting the lorentz force is less justified .",
    "however , the magnetic pressure gradient averages out when taking the mean so the only contribution of the lorentz force to @xmath25 is from magnetic tension .",
    "this generally tends to suppress rotational shear ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so it is unlikely to be the dominant factor in establishing the solar differential rotation . in this paper",
    "we wish to establish a lower limit on how strong the reynolds stress must be in order to balance the advection of angular momentum by the meridional flow ; that is , the term on the left - hand - side ( lhs ) of ( [ eq : gp ] )",
    ". if it must also balance magnetic tension , then the reynolds stress must be even stronger .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the lorentz force is not likely to change the lower bounds we establish in  [ sec : amp ] .",
    "thus , if we assume the reynolds stress is the dominant contribution to @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) becomes @xmath26 where primes indicate fluctuations about the mean . since @xmath27 is cylindrically outward in the sun , the implication here is that the angular momentum transport by the reynolds stress ( rhs ) establishes the meridional flow by inducing a flow toward the rotation axis when the rhs is negative ( divergence ) and away from the rotation axis when the rhs is positive ( convergence ) .",
    "this mechanism is known as gyroscopic pumping ( mh11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is supported by convection simulations and mean - field models @xcite .",
    "the fundamental physics behind gyroscopic pumping is discussed by mh11 , @xcite and @xcite . in short ,",
    "an axial variation in the net torque @xmath28 establishes an axial shear @xmath29 which in turn induces a meridional flow through the coriolis force (  [ sec : twb ] ) . in order to determine the nature of the differential rotation that will ultimately be established",
    ", one must consider the meridional force balance as we do in the next section .",
    "however , the equilibrium structure of the meridional flow is surprisingly less sensitive to the meridional force balance and is instead regulated mainly by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) .",
    "this is because the primary contribution to @xmath27 is from the mean ( globally averaged ) rotation rate of the sun , @xmath30 ( see mh11 and  [ sec : estimates ] below ) , so changes in the differential rotation , @xmath31 , do not change the balance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) appreciably .      in  [ sec : gp ] we argued that the mean meridional circulation in the solar envelope is established and maintained through gyroscopic pumping , as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) . since the process of gyroscopic pumping",
    "is mediated by the coriolis force , this is equivalent to saying that the meridional circulation is maintained by the inertia of the differential rotation ( mh11 ) .",
    "however , it is well known that thermal gradients can also establish meridional circulation by means of baroclinicity and it is sometimes argued that the meridional flow in the solar convection zone may be baroclinic in nature . in this section",
    "we argue that this is not the case . in particular",
    ", we consider the meridional force balance in the solar convection zone within the context of solar observations and we argue that gyroscopic pumping , as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) , rather than baroclinicity , is the primary mechanism by which the solar meridional circulation is maintained .",
    "the ambiguity arises because the thermal energy equation can be expressed in a manner analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 involves the ( negative ) divergence of the convective entropy flux , the radiative diffusion , and the viscous and ohmic heating , although the latter are negligible in stellar interiors .",
    "it is clear from equations ( [ eq : gp ] ) and ( [ eq : therm ] ) that both mechanical and thermal forcing , @xmath25 and @xmath33 , can induce a meridional circulation .",
    "indeed , this is a classical problem in the theory of planetary and stellar atmospheres @xcite . in a solar context , eq .",
    "( [ eq : therm ] ) plays an important role in the radiative spreading of the solar tachocline @xcite",
    ".    we can be reasonably certain from solar observations that both @xmath25 and @xmath33 are nonzero .",
    "if this were not the case , then a steady state would only be possible if either @xmath34 or @xmath35 were constant on streamlines of the meridional mass flux .",
    "helioseismic rotational inversions together with observations of poleward mass flux in the solar surface layers rule out the former ( @xmath34 constant on streamlines ) .",
    "the latter is ruled out by mass conservation ( @xmath36 must be nonzero in the deep convection zone to sustain the poleward mass flux in the surface layers ) and the requirement that at least some portion of the convection zone be superadiabatic @xmath37 .",
    "the relative contribution of mechanical and thermal forcing to establishing the meridional flow becomes more clear if we consider the mean zonal vorticity equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is obtained from the meridional components of the mhd momentum equation , averaged over longitude and time .",
    "previous work based on numerical convection simulations @xcite , mean - field models @xcite , and theoretical interpretation of helioseismic rotational inversions @xcite suggest that the dominant contributions to this equation are the coriolis and centrifugal terms associated with the differential rotation as well as the zonal component of the baroclinic vector .",
    "the latter is proportional to the mean latitudinal entropy gradient if the stratification is nearly hydrostatic and adiabatic and if the equation of state is that of an ideal gas .",
    "thus , neglecting the meridional components of the reynolds stress , the lorentz force , the viscous diffusion , thermal fluctuations , and quadratic terms in @xmath38 yields @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the longitudinal component of the fluid vorticity @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the specific entropy , @xmath43 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath44 is the specific heat at constant pressure .    we have retained the time dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meridional ] ) in order to illustrate how mechanical and thermal forcing influence the evolution of the meridional flow .",
    "if the balance in equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) is not satisfied , this will lead to a change in the specific angular momentum @xmath45 that will in turn influence the meridional flow through the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : meridional ] ) .",
    "likewise , any imbalance in equation ( [ eq : therm ] ) will change the baroclinic ( second ) term through @xmath46 .",
    "the system will evolve nonlinearly toward thermal wind balance ( twb ) , described by an equation that is now well known : @xmath47 most current theoretical and numerical models of solar mean flows attribute the conical nature of the solar differential rotation profile ( @xmath48 ) to latitudinal entropy gradients through eq .",
    "( [ eq : twb ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite have argued that the orientation of the @xmath4 isosurfaces in the solar cz inferred from helioseismology follows from thermal wind balance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : twb ] ) , together with the hypothesis that isorotation and isentropic surfaces coincide .",
    "furthermore , the existence of the near - surface shear layer suggests that there is a transition near @xmath1 below which the rossby number is less than unity and thermal wind balance prevails ( mh11 ) .",
    "although we agree that it plays an essential role in determining the orientation of the angular velocity isosurfaces in the solar convection zone , we note that baroclinicity due to axisymmetric thermal gradients can not account for the existence of the solar differential rotation",
    ". the zonal component of the reynolds stress must also contribute .",
    "this is demonstrated in the appendix .    here",
    "we wish to focus on the approach to thermal wind balance by means of the time - dependent vorticity equation ( [ eq : meridional ] ) .",
    "although the meridional circulation itself , represented by @xmath49 , drops out of the balance equation in a steady state , any imbalance between < the inertial and baroclinic terms on the rhs will induce a flow . consider for example the northern hemisphere ( nh ) .",
    "there it is well known from helioseimic observations that @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this will tend to induce a counter - clockwise ( ccw ) circulation ( @xmath51 , poleward in the upper convection zone ) that will act to make the @xmath4 profile more cylindrical ( @xmath52 ) in accordance with the taylor - proudman theorem .",
    "in order to oppose this and achieve twb [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : twb ] ) ] , there must be a poleward entropy gradient ( @xmath53 in the nh ) . in short , the inertial term tends to induce a ccw circulation in the northern hemisphere while the baroclinic term tends to induce a clockwise ( cw ) circulation ( vice versa in the southern hemisphere ) .    in the approach to equilibrium",
    ", one of these terms must act as the driver , accelerating the meridional flow , while the other acts as a resistance , opposing the acceleration until a balance is achieved .",
    "the observed poleward sense of the meridional flow near the solar surface (  [ sec : intro ] ) indicates that the driver is in fact the inertial term @xmath54 . as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : gp ] , this links the mean flows directly to the convective reynolds stress and enables us to estimate the amplitude of the convective velocities based on the observed differential rotation and meridional flow .",
    "there is one potential caveat to this conclusion .",
    "the recent analysis by @xcite based on autocorrelation of photospheric dopplergrams suggests that there may be a reversal of the meridional flow at @xmath1 .",
    "if this is indeed true , than we can not rule out a cw circulation cell ( nh , ccw in the south ) in the deep convection zone driven by baroclinic forcing ( implying poleward flow near the base of the cz ) .",
    "however , this is in conflict with helioseismic inversions which suggest the meridional flow remains poleward well below 0.95@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , poleward flow near the base of the cz would be disasterous for flux - transport dynamo models (  [ sec : ftd ] ) .",
    "this in itself does not preclude the presence of such a cell but it demonstrates that poleward flow at the base of the convection zone is contrary to our current understanding of solar interior dynamics .",
    "in this section we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) to obtain lower limits on the amplitude of convective velocities throughout the solar convection zone .",
    "the motions we are most interested in are the motions that are responsible for establishing the solar differential rotation by means of the reynolds stress .",
    "thus , unlike solar granulation , they must be large enough and slow enough to sense the rotational influence and spherical geometry .",
    "the mere existence of the solar differential rotation is evidence for the presence of such motions . in what follows",
    ", we will quantify what we mean by _ large enough _ and _ slow enough_.    we begin by estimating the amplitude of the reynolds stress inside the divergence operator on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) ; @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the characteristic amplitude of the convective velocity and @xmath57 is a correlation coefficient describing the efficiency of the convective angular momentum transport .",
    "if flows are perfectly correlated , the transport is efficient and @xmath58 .",
    "however , in practice @xmath59 will fall somewhere between zero and one .",
    "convection simulations such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] below yield @xmath60 0.10.2 .",
    "similar values of are given by the mean - field theory of @xcite . there",
    "the amplitude of the non - diffusive component of the reynolds stress , @xmath61 , is of order @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the turbulent viscosity , @xmath64 is the correlation time , and @xmath65 is a nondimensional normalization factor that depends on the inverse rossby number @xmath66 .",
    "this yields @xmath67 , which according to their model , is about 0.1 - 0.2 in the lower cz .",
    "note that we use a single velocity scale @xmath56 to characterize the convection but this does not necessarily imply that the velocity field is isotropic . on the contrary , the velocity scale is defined in terms of the reynolds stress through equation ( [ eq : rsamp ] ) , which requires some degree of anisotropy .",
    "thus , @xmath56 can be regarded in general as the geometric mean of the two velocity components that dominate the reynolds stress .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that the density @xmath17 is spherically symmetric and is approximately given by model s of @xcite . then substituting ( [ eq : rsamp ] ) into ( [ eq : bob ] ) and noting that @xmath68 provides a lower limit on @xmath56 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a characteristic amplitude of the meridional flow and @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the length scale associated with the divergence operator in ( [ eq : bob ] ) and @xmath73 as above .",
    "as above with the convection , we emphasize that the meridional flow is not isotropic .",
    "this is particularly true in the upper and lower boundary layers of the cz where the meridional flow is predominantly horizontal and at the equator where it is predominantly vertical .",
    "the proper interpretation for @xmath70 is the amplitude of the flow across @xmath34 isosurfaces , which are approximately cylindrical .",
    "so , @xmath70 should be regarded as the flow toward or away from the rotation axis , which may be predominantly radial or latitudinal depending on the latitude .",
    "a useful variation of equation ( [ eq : vamp ] ) can be obtained if we consider only the component of @xmath34 involving the mean rotation rate @xmath30 .",
    "this gives @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the zonal velocity associated with the rotation of the star . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : vamp ] ) gives @xmath76 thus , if @xmath77 is of order unity , then a lower limit on the convective velocity can be obtained by taking the geometric mean between the meridional flow speed and the rotational speed , relative to an inertial frame .",
    "taking nominal values of @xmath78 210 m s@xmath0 , @xmath79 s@xmath0 , and @xmath80 would then yield @xmath81 47106 m s@xmath0 .",
    "however , as we will see below , @xmath77 is likely to be somewhat less than unity , bringing these estimates down .",
    "still , the extension from ( [ eq : vamp ] ) to ( [ eq : limit1 ] ) is robust , since the differential rotation serves to steepen the @xmath34 gradient relative to the uniform rotation value of @xmath82 ( see  [ sec : estimates ] ) .",
    "it now remains to estimate @xmath83 . in this context , it is important to emphasize that @xmath72 reflects the scale of turbulent transport , which is not necessarily the same as the scale @xmath84 of the convective motions themselves ( the latter is addressed in ",
    "[ sec : himp ] ) . if the balance expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) is to be realized , then this scale must be intimately linked to the structure of the meridional circulation . indeed ,",
    "if our picture of gyroscopic pumping is correct then the structure of the meridional circulation is largely _ determined _ by the spatial variation of the reynolds stress , as reflected by @xmath72 .    to illustrate this relationship , consider the simplest case of a single meridional circulation cell in each hemisphere , with poleward flow in the upper cz and equatorward flow in the lower cz .",
    "then the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) would be correspondingly negative and positive in the upper and lower cz respectively . to balance this ,",
    "the rhs must also change sign , suggesting @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the depth of the convection zone .",
    "if @xmath25 were to exhibit multiple sign changes across the cz , this would produce multiple layered circulation cells in radius such that @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of cells .",
    "for the moment arm we can consider mid - latitudes in the mid - convection zone , so @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath91 where we have used the value for the sun of @xmath92 . as noted , this corresponds to poleward or equatorward flow at mid latitudes in one or more circulation cells .",
    "so , when used with eq .",
    "( [ eq : vamp ] ) or ( [ eq : limit1 ] ) the value of @xmath70 should correspond to the latitudinal flow speed .",
    "the caveat that can potentially limit the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) is that , although @xmath88 is regulated by the number of nodes in @xmath25 ( sign changes in the reynolds stress divergence ) , the flow amplitude @xmath70 is regulated by local gradients .",
    "this is particularly important at the base of the cz where a strong convergence of the angular momentum flux over a narrow layer could drive an arbitrarily strong equatorward flow @xmath70 for a given @xmath56 .    to demonstrate this concept ,",
    "consider a single - celled meridional circulation profile ( @xmath93 ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : mcfig ] .",
    "we define the radius @xmath94 as the turnaround radius , where the poleward flow in the upper cz transitions to the equatorward flow in the lower cz .",
    "we also postulate the existence of a radius @xmath95 below which the amplitude of the meridional circulation becomes negligible .",
    "the existence of such a radius can be inferred based on the presence of the solar tachocline as deduced from helioseismology . in the absence of other forces ,",
    "the combined effects of gyroscopic pumping , thermal wind balance , and radiative diffusion would induce a meridional circulation below the convection zone that would wipe out the radial shear in the tachocline , causing the latitudinal shear to spread downward on a time scale of several billion years @xcite .",
    "helioseimic inversions indicate that this has not happened , suggesting the presence of some unknown torques that act to confine the tachocline ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the thinness of the tachocline inferred from helioseismic rotation inversions suggests that the amplitude of the meridional circulation likely drops off rapidly below the base of the convection zone @xcite .",
    "so , in light of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) , @xmath94 separates the the region of poleward flow and flux divergence ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 , from the region of equatorward flow and flux convergence ( @xmath98 ) , @xmath99 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : delta ] ) effectively assumes that the width of these layers is comparable , such that @xmath100 . in other words ,",
    "this equation breaks down if the equatorward flow is confined to a much smaller region than the poleward flow , or vice versa . in this case",
    "the effective @xmath101 could become arbitrarily small , implying small values of @xmath83 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "a similar caveat also holds for the multi - celled case @xmath103 .",
    "the mechanical forcing required to establish an asymmetric meridional circulation profile such as that depicted in figure [ fig : mcfig ] via gyroscopic pumping may or may not be convective in origin ( _ asymmetric _ in the sense that @xmath104 ) .",
    "a localized convergence of angular momentum flux could arise from the convective reynolds stress as convective plumes are rapidly decelerated by the subadiabatic stratification near the base of the cz .",
    "alternatively , it could arise from whatever non - convective processes may be involved in tachocline confinement , such as large - scale lorentz forces or reynolds and maxwell stresses induced by mhd instabilities @xcite .",
    "whatever its origin , the confinement mechanism would have to transport angular momentum poleward in order to prevent the radiative spreading of the tachocline .",
    "this would imply a convergence of angular momentum at mid to high latitudes that would in turn induce a prograde torque and an equatorward flow by means of gyroscopic pumping .",
    "this may plausibly be confined to a thin boundary layer in the vicinity of the tachocline .",
    "regardless of how thin the region of equatorward flow may be , conservation of mass requires that there be a net poleward flow in the remainder of the cz , implying a flux divergence .",
    "might this also occur in a thin layer , such that @xmath105 ?",
    "if so , would nt equation ( [ eq : vamp ] ) imply that @xmath56 could be arbitrarily small ?",
    "in other words , could weak convection maintain the observed mean flows in the solar interior by establishing a reynolds stress that is nearly divergenceless in the bulk of the cz , with narrow regions of divergence and convergence in the upper and lower boundary layers ? in the remainder of this section",
    "we argue that the answer to this question is likely to be no .",
    "although this scenario is in principle consistent with the physics of gyroscopic pumping , it can be largely ruled out by helioseismic measurements .",
    "we begin with a direct estimate of @xmath83 in the surface layers obtained from helioseismic determinations of the meridional flow . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , local heloiseismic inversions suggest that the radius at which the poleward surface flow reverses sign is no shallower than @xmath106 , so @xmath107 . if we equate this with @xmath72 , this provides a lower bound for @xmath83 in the surface layers : @xmath108 thus , the factor of @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vamp ] ) is likely to be no smaller that 0.26 in the surface layers .",
    "we now consider the nonlocal nature of gyroscopic pumping , which provides a link between regions of reynolds stress convergence and divergence even if they are spatially separated ( mh11 ) .",
    "local forcing can in principle induce a global meridional flow that couples the two regions , even if they are localized in the upper and lower boundary layers .",
    "furthermore , since isosurfaces of @xmath34 are approximately radial at high latitudes , a single circulation cell with poleward flow at the surface , downward flow near the poles , and equatorward flow at the base of the cz could in principle be sustained even if the high - latitude reynolds stress were divergenceless in the bulk of the cz ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , @xmath25 can not be zero in the bulk of the cz at low latitudes .",
    "mass conservation requires a radially outward meridional flow that must be balanced by the reynolds stress .",
    "if it were not , the circulation would quickly homogenize @xmath34 at the equator , establishing an inward @xmath4 gradient ( @xmath111 ) on a crossing time scale @xmath112 ( about 6 years for @xmath113 m s@xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 profile and the horizontal divergence of the meridional flow inferred from solar observations provide a robust diagnostic of the reynolds stress at the equator .",
    "we now exploit this diagnostic to obtain alternative estimates for @xmath83 and @xmath56 .",
    "symmetry requires that the radial component of the flux divergence on the rhs of ( [ eq : bob ] ) vanish at the equator , so @xmath72 must correspond to the latitudinal convergence of the angular momentum flux that sustains the radially outward @xmath70 . since the convergence of @xmath25 must span all latitudes where the flow is outward , we can estimate @xmath72 from the outward mass flux @xmath114 .",
    "we have defined @xmath115 to be the outward mass flux in one hemisphere because in  [ sec : estimates ] we will equate it to the observed poleward mass flux in the surface layers .",
    "setting @xmath116 at the equator then gives us an alternate estimate for @xmath83 @xmath117 substituting this expression into ( [ eq : vamp ] ) yields @xmath118 note that the meridional flow only appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : limit2 ] ) through the mass flux @xmath115 , which we can estimate from helioseismic inversions (  [ sec : estimates ] ) .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath17 are also known from helioseismology and solar structure models , eq .  ( [ eq : limit2 ] ) provides a robust lower limit on the convective velocity near the equator that is independent of @xmath83 .",

    "larger convection amplitudes disrupt the flux storage , promoting buoyancy instabilities on time scales shorter than the dynamo amplification time of a few years .",
    "arguably one of the most successful ( and certainly one of the most popular ) current paradigms for modeling the origin of the solar activity cycle is the flux - transport dynamo . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite and @xcite and for further details see @xcite , and many more .",
    "flux - transport ( ft ) dynamo models are mean - field models that solve the axisymmetric mhd induction equation , typically in the kinematic limit . like other mean - field models ,",
    "they involve specified prescriptions for magnetic field generation and transport by non - axisymmetric motions such as convection and flux emergence that lie outside the scope of the model .",
    "their defining characteristic that sets them apart from other mean - field models is that the mean meridional circulation plays an essential role in transporting magnetic flux and in thereby regulating the cycle period .    of particular importance is the direction and speed of the meridional flow near the base of the convection zone .",
    "there , an equatorward flow with a speed of 2 - 4 m s@xmath0 provides a robust mechanism for producing solar - like butterfly diagrams , whereby the mean toroidal field ( taken as a proxy for sunspots ) migrates toward the equator on a time scale of about 11 years .",
    "most ft models are also babcock - leighton models in which the emergence and subsequent dispersal of active region flux in the photosphere acts as a source for mean poloidal field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the principal source of poloidal flux and if the mean toroidal field is generated near the base of the convection zone as in most models , then the dynamo requires a transport mechanism in order to operate .",
    "the two principal transport mechanisms considered in the literature are the meridional circulation and turbulent transport , the latter typically represented as a turbulent diffusion or magnetic pumping .",
    "thus , babcock - leighton ft models may be further classified as advection - dominated or diffusion - dominated depending on which of these transport mechanisms plays a larger role @xcite .",
    "in short , the meridional circulation in advection - dominated ft dynamo models serves two roles .",
    "first , it regulates the cycle period through the equatorward transport of toroidal flux near the base of the cz and second , it couples the spatially separated source regions for mean poloidal and toroidal flux .",
    "these two roles are distinct but they are not independent .",
    "for example , if the transport mechanism coupling poloidal and toroidal sources is too efficient , it can `` short - circuit '' the dynamo , reducing the cycle period by decreasing the effective path length at the base of the cz over which the equatorward advection of toroidal flux operates .",
    "the advection - dominated regime generally works well in the sense that it compares well with solar observations . imposing a single - celled meridional flow in radius ( @xmath93 ) with a poleward flow speed of 10 - 20 m s@xmath0 near the surface as indicated by observations (  [ sec : intro ] ) and an equatorward return flow of 2 - 4 m s@xmath0 near the base of the convection zone ( consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : vtheta ] ) generally produces solar - like magnetic cycles with a duration of about 11 years when used in conjuction with a solar - like differential rotation profile and a babcock - leighton source .",
    "more subtle issues such as dynamo parity , saturation , and cycle modulation have generally been handled through minor variations on this basic paradigm .",
    "for example , dipolar parity can be promoted by an additional source of poloidal flux deeper in the cz @xcite or by enhanced turbulent diffusion in the surface layers @xcite .",
    "although their empirical success and simplicity is rather compelling , the principle problem with ft dynamo models has always been the theoretical justification of the advection - dominated regime . in order for the meridional circulation to dominate the flux transport",
    ", convective transport must be relatively inefficient .",
    "advection - dominated ft models typically model the latter as a turbulent diffusion and set the amplitude of the turbulent diffusivity @xmath200 in the mid convection zone to be @xmath8 10@xmath201 cm s@xmath202 or less .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than estimates of @xmath200 based on mixing - length theory and convection simulations ; see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the problem .",
    "our estimates of the convective velocity and length scales in  [ sec : amp ] provide a measure of the convective transport that is independent of mixing length theory and convection simulations .",
    "moreover , these estimates are directly linked to the amplitude and profile of the differential rotation and meridional circulation , which are essential ingredients in all ft dynamo models . thus , to explore the implications of these estimates",

    "thus , we conclude that current advection - dominated ft dynamo models are not strictly self - consistent . in particular , the amplitude of turbulent transport they typically assume is not commensurate with the mean flows they employ .",
    "again , this has been argued before based on mixing - length theory and convection simulations but here we demonstrate more generally that it is a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) .    a potential way out of this dilemma is by moving to the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "this would entail using values of @xmath207 cm s@xmath0 throughout most of the convection zone .",
    "such models have indeed had some success in modeling the solar cycle , and may actually do better in certain respects than advection - dominated models .",
    "examples include reproducing the observed cycle amplitude - period relationship and triggering grand minima through variations in the meridional flow @xcite .",
    "however , it can be a challenge for diffusion - dominated ft models ( or any model in which the transport by turbulent diffusion or magnetic pumping is very efficient ) to achieve cycle periods as long as 11 years .",
    "as noted above , efficient turbulent transport in a babcock - leighton dynamo tends to short - circuit the region over which the dynamo operates and to thus decrease the cycle period .",
    "this is sometimes avoided by allowing the meridional circulation to extend well below the convection zone . however ,",
    "if the turbulent diffusivity there is low , then these models may suffer from the same problem described here ( namely that the local amplitude of @xmath200 is incommensurate with the local amplitude of the meridional flow ) .",
    "alternatively , one could place the turnover radius @xmath94 higher up in the cz to achieve a slower meridional flow in the lower cz and thus a longer period ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . still",
    ", the downward turbulent transport can not be so efficient that it suppresses the poleward migration of residual flux from active regions that is seen in photospheric observations .",
    "alternatively , it has been argued that the quenching of turbulent transport by lorentz force feedbacks may be able to salvage the advection - dominated regime @xcite .",
    "however , it remains to be seen whether or not this is viable .",
    "quenching would be most effective for strong toroidal fields near the base of the cz as opposed to the relatively weak poloidal fields whose turbulent transport across the cz could potentially short - circuit the advection by the meridional flow .",
    "in other words , quenching is more likely to regulate the first role noted above for the meridional circulation in ft dynamos ( equatorward advection of toroidal flux ) as opposed to the second ( coupling of poloidal and toroidal sources ) , and it is the second which generally defines the advection - dominated regime .    furthermore , the arguments presented here demonstrate that a significant reduction in @xmath56 by lorentz force feedbacks as captured by quenching mechanisms would have substantial consequences for the mean flows .",
    "for example , if we treat @xmath226 as fixed , eq .",
    "( [ eq : limit1 ] ) indicates that a reduction in @xmath56 by an order of magnitude may be accompanied by a reduction of the meridional flow speed @xmath70 by two orders of magnitude ( unless the efficiency factor @xmath59 increases ) .",
    "this follows from the concept of gyroscopic pumping discussed in ",
    "[ sec : gp ] , provided that the nature of the lorentz forces is solely to suppress convection .",
    "however , if the lorentz force exerts its own mean torques , which is likely , then this should be included in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) , with corresponding modifications to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vamp ] ) and ( [ eq : limit1 ] ) .",
    "the time dependence should also be taken into account , potentially mitigating limits on @xmath200 for a given meridional flow speed .",
    "even so , a self - consistent treatment of diffusivity quenching that takes into account its dynamical effect on the maintenance of mean flows could dramatically alter the operation of a ft dynamo by substantially modifying the meridional circulation and , to a lesser extent , the differential rotation .",
    "a related possibility is that turbulent transport at very high magnetic reynolds numbers may simply be less efficient than suggested by crude , kinematic representations based on the concept of turbulent diffusion .",
    "nonlinear processes such as the dynamical alignment of fields and flows that contribute to dynamo saturation may also suppress turbulent transport in a way that is more subtle than a quenched local diffusion coefficient .",
    "this might require more sophisticated mean - field and/or mhd convection models to properly capture .",
    "still another possibility , of course , is that the solar dynamo does not follow the canonical babcock - leighton / flux - transport paradigm .",
    "in this paper we estimate the amplitude and scale of the convective motions responsible for maintaining the solar differential rotation and meridional circulation . this estimate is based only on the observed properties of the mean flows in the sun together with three fundamental physical premises grounded in the mhd equations .",
    "the first and most important of these three premises is represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) .",
    "this tells us that , in order to achieve a statistically steady state , the angular momentum transport by the convective reynolds stress must balance the advection of angular momentum by the meridional flow .",
    "this provides a direct link between the amplitude of mean flows and the amplitude of convective motions such that observations of the former can set constraints on the latter .",
    "note that this dynamical balance is to be understood in a time - averaged sense , filtering out solar cycle variations of meridional and zonal flows .",
    "the second physical premise we rely on is that of mass conservation [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : divmc ] ) in the appendix ] .",
    "this allows us to estimate the net equatorward flow speed in the deep cz based on observations of the poleward flow near the surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vtheta ] .",
    "this result in turn allows us to extend the diagnostic power of our first premise to the deep convection zone where mean flows are established .",
    "the third premise is that of thermal wind balance , eq .  ( [ eq : twb ] ) .",
    "although this is not used directly in our estimates for the convective velocity amplitude @xmath56 , it helps to justify the concept of gyroscopic pumping discussed in  [ sec : gp ] .",
    "in particular , when coupled with helioseismic rotational inversions , it suggests that the principle mechanism responsible for maintaining the solar meridional circulation is the inertia of the differential rotation , as represented by the coriolis force (  [ sec : twb ] ) .    together with these three physical premises , we use three observational foundations .",
    "the first is the solar differential rotation inferred from helioseismology .",
    "the second is a persistent poleward meridional flow from low to high latitudes for @xmath5 with an amplitude of roughly 1015 m s@xmath0 .",
    "the third observational foundation is the mean density profile @xmath227 in the cz . although this is obtained from a solar structure model ( model s ) , we regard it as an observation because it is verified to within a few percent by helioseismic structure inversions .",
    "the results suggest that the amplitude of convective velocities in the upper cz ( @xmath1 ) must be at least 30 m s@xmath0 in order to sustain the observed mean flows .",
    "analogous limits in the lower cz are less reliable due to uncertainties about the meridional flow but reasonable inferences suggest that convective amplitudes can be no less than about 8 m s@xmath0 at @xmath228 .",
    "the existence of the near - surface shear layer ( nssl ) provides a smoking gun that we can exploit to link these convective amplitudes to a size scale .",
    "in particular , it suggests that the characteristic rossby number crosses unity somewhere near the base of the nssl at @xmath1 ( mh11 ) . together with the velocity limits obtained in  [ sec : amp ] , this implies deeper convective motions can be no smaller than 5.5 mm .",
    "this is of course a conservative limit .",
    "surface convection simulations suggest that the size scale of convective motions progressively increases with depth , from the @xmath9 1 mm granulation scales at the surface to @xmath9 30 mm supergranulation scales by @xmath195 , due mainly to an increase in the density and pressure scale heights ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , the limit given here provides an independent constraint on the size of deep convection that depends only on the three physical premises and observational foundations noted above ( along with a fourth premise that @xmath142 marks the base of the nssl ) .",
    "the lower limits on convective velocity and size scales reported here are consistent with the upper limits inferred from local helioseismology by @xcite provided that the characteristic size of the convective motions at @xmath1 lies somewhere in the range between 5.583 mm .",
    "this corresponds to a range in spherical harmonic degree of @xmath229",
    ". this range may be too wide to provide a strong constraint on convection models but it can be narrowed somewhat if one requires that motions at and below @xmath230 be no smaller than supergranules , so @xmath231 mm and @xmath165 .    since our work is concerned specifically with the relationship between convective transport and mean flows , it has important implications for flux transport dynamo models (  [ sec : ftd ] ) .",
    "in particular , it suggests that advection - dominated ft models are not self - consistent in the sense that the assumed magnitude of convective transport is generally too low to account for the mean flows they require to operate .",
    "this has been argued before based on estimates of @xmath56 and @xmath84 obtained from mixing length theory and convection models ( cf .",
    "however , here we demonstrate that it is a more general consequence of the need to sustain the mean flows against their own inertia .",
    "the essence of the problem can be appreciated simply from eq .",
    "( [ eq : limit1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath232 and @xmath233 , then @xmath56 must be significantly larger than @xmath70 .",
    "thus , one would expect convection to dominate transport over the meridional circulation unless its spatial and temporal correlation scales are small .",
    "however , these correlation scales can not be too small because if they were , the influence of rotation on the convection would not be strong enough to establish a solar - like differential rotation ( i.e.  @xmath141 would be greater than unity ; see  [ sec : himp ] ) .",
    "this result casts some doubt on the advection - dominated flux - transport paradigm as a viable model of the solar cycle but it does not necessarily rule it out .",
    "an alternative possibility is that convective flux transport in the extreme parameter regimes of the solar interior is much less efficient than suggested by turbulent diffusion and that we have much to learn about reliably representing this transport in mean - field dynamo models .",
    "the estimates reported here are independent of mixing - length theory and convection simulations but they give compatible values for @xmath56 and @xmath84 , suggesting internal consistency (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "furthermore , they suggest that the velocity and length scales responsible for maintaining solar mean flows can not be drastically different from those currently exhibited by global convection simulations .",
    "this bodes well for the future ; as global convection models continue to move toward higher resolution and improved representations of the upper and lower boundary layers , they should be able to capture the essential physics underlying the solar differential rotation and meridional circulation with increasing fidelity .",

    "we demonstrate further that baroclinicity alone can not account for the solar differential rotation as inferred from helioseismology .",
    "similar issues have been studied for decades within the context of planetary and stellar atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the importance of baroclinicity for shaping the solar differential rotation profile is undisputed .",
    "theoretical models , mean - field models , and global convection simulations all suggest that baroclinic forcing is necessary to account for the conical nature of mid - latitude @xmath4 surfaces in the solar cz inferred from helioseismology @xcite .",
    "however , this result should not be misinterpreted to attribute the solar differential rotation entirely to baroclinic forcing .",
    "such a clarification is particularly timely in light of the recent work by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrate that the centrifugal distortion of the base of the convection zone can produce thermal gradients along isobaric surfaces that can in turn induce differential rotation through baroclinic forcing",
    ". this background shear may then interact with convection to produce the observed mean flows .",
    "we do not dispute this argument but again we caution against a potential misinterpretation of their results .",
    "in particular , we argue that baroclinicity alone can not induce a net equatorward angular velocity gradient ( @xmath234 in the northern hemisphere , or nh ) throughout the cz as exhibited by helioseismic rotational inversions .",
    "our argument begins with the time - dependent zonal vorticity equation ( [ eq : meridional ] ) .",
    "again we neglect the reynolds stress , lorentz force , and viscous diffusion .",
    "we proceed to consider a fixed entropy gradient @xmath235 and we ask what differential rotation such baroclinic forcing will produce when subject to a given initial condition @xmath236 and @xmath237 .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : twb ] , a poleward entropy gradient will induce a clockwise meridional circulation cell in the nh ( @xmath53 , @xmath238 ) .",
    "although it was not necessary for the arguments presented in ",
    "[ sec : meanflows ] , we now adopt the anelastic approximation so the mean mass flux is divergenceless : @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the background density profile , averaged over latitude , longitude , and time .",
    "thus , the conservation of mass requires that the generation of zonal vorticity @xmath49 be associated with flows both toward and away from the rotation axis .",
    "this is crucial in understanding the significance of the results that follow .    in order to address the generation of rotational shear",
    ", we must consider the time - dependent version of the zonal momentum eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) .",
    "another crucial realization required to appreciate the results that follow is that there is no baroclinic component of the net axial torque @xmath25 .",
    "recall that @xmath25 involves only the reynolds stress , the lorentz force , and the viscous diffusion ( explicit expressions are given in mh11 ) .",
    "if baroclinic forcing is to induce a differential rotation , it must do so by means of the meridional flow .",
    "thus , we can set @xmath241 , which yields ( mh11 ) @xmath242 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dldt ] ) we have again used the anelastic approximation so we have replaced @xmath17 with @xmath243 .",
    "two things are immediately apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dldt ] ) .",
    "first , for a given meridional flow @xmath244 , this is identical to the equation for passive advection of a scalar field .",
    "second , the only steady solution is one in which @xmath245 .",
    "such a steady state can be achieved in one of two ways .",
    "either the meridional flow must vanish @xmath246 or the specific angular momentum @xmath34 must be constant on streamlines . the latter case , @xmath18 constant on streamlines ,",
    "would necessarily be associated with an anti - solar differential rotation profile , such that the poles would spin faster than the equator ( @xmath247 in the nh ) .",
    "we will return to the former case , that of @xmath246 below .",
    "now return the time - dependent problem outlined above in which we follow the response of the mean flows to a specified baroclinic forcing @xmath235 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the initial angular velocity profile is cylindrical , so @xmath248 . as noted below",
    ", this is not a necessary assumption but it serves well to illustrate the main point .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the initial angular momentum gradient is directed away from the rotation axis , so @xmath249 , where @xmath250 .",
    "this is true for the current sun , it is true for a uniform rotation ( @xmath251 ) , and we suspect that it is true in general for stars since the alternative , @xmath252 is unstable according to the rayleigh criterion @xcite .",
    "note that the case @xmath253 is a fixed point ; if this were the initial state , meridional circulation would not influence the zonal flow and baroclinicity would not induce a differential rotation .    consider a volume @xmath254 defined by @xmath255 and @xmath256 , where @xmath6 is the solar surface and @xmath257 is a fiducial cylindrical radius that can lie anywhere between zero and @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath262 the @xmath4 profile is cylindrical so @xmath34 can be pulled out of the integral on the right - hand - side ( rhs ) .",
    "mass conservation then implies that the rhs vanishes and the rate of change of @xmath263 vanishes .",
    "however , the analogy with the passive scalar noted above makes it clear that this can not hold indefinitely .",
    "our intuition tells us that if @xmath264 then the advection of angular momentum into our volume must increase @xmath263 over time .      applying a time derivative to ( [ eq : dlvdt ] ) and substituting in ( [ eq : dldt ] ) yields",
    "@xmath266 in obtaining this result we have neglected the time dependence of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the second derivative of @xmath263 is positive definite at @xmath262 .",
    "together with ( [ eq : taylor ] ) this implies that the angular momentum within @xmath254 will increase with time .",
    "put another way , this implies that any persistent meridional circulation will tend to spin up the poles relative to the equator .",
    "this is true regardless of the ( nonzero ) amplitude or profile of the circulation and regardless of the source of the circulation , whether it be baroclinic in nature or due to some other meridional forcing .",
    "furthermore , it holds for any arbitrary initial @xmath34 profile that is stable in the sense that @xmath267 . in this general case , @xmath34 surfaces would still intersect @xmath6 at two locations and @xmath254 would be defined relative to the surface @xmath268 such that @xmath255 and @xmath269 . then eq .

    "the early time dependence would still be given by ( [ eq : taylor ] ) with @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "this argument can also be readily generalized to a spherical annulus .",

    "then the conclusion is unaltered ; a baroclinically - driven meridional flow will increase the total angular momentum in the polar cap @xmath254 over time , provided only that @xmath278 .",
    "spin - up of the poles can be avoided if the rossby number is small , which is a good approximation for the sun .",
    "here the relevant rossby number is that based on the meridional flow @xmath279 ) . for @xmath280 , meridional flows",

    "we can not rule this out from helioseismic rotational inversions but there is currently no evidence for it .",
