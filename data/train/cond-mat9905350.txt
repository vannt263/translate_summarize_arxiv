    "it is now well appreciated that in certain situations , the translational symmetry of an electron gas becomes broken at low temperatures giving rise to an electron solid state called the wigner crystal ( wc ) .",
    "@xcite among other conditions , low density and low disorder are crucial for this novel state to be realized ; the inter - electron distance has to be large enough for the coulomb interaction to dominate the quantum zero - point fluctuations , and the disorder must be weak enough not to destroy the long- ( or quasi - long- ) range order .",
    "one of the systems that satisfy these conditions best is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in the gaas / algaas heterostructure , in which density and disorder can be controlled relatively easily .",
    "furthermore , if a strong magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 2d plane , the cyclotron motion quenches zero - point fluctuations and the low - density condition is even more easily achieved .",
    "@xcite    although direct observations of the positional order from scattering measurements , for example , have been unattainable , there have been considerable efforts to prove the existence of the wc through more or less indirect methods such as transport measurements @xcite and photoluminescence .",
    "@xcite one of the most convincing evidences so far is that the 2d systems become insulating when the filling factor @xmath1 is low : @xmath2 for electron systems @xcite and @xmath3 for hole systems .",
    "@xcite this insulating behavior is generally accepted as a result of pinning of the wc due to impurities .",
    "the impurity potential is also supposed to provide a restoring force in the ac electromagnetic response of the wc .",
    "if the frequency of the external driving force matches the natural frequency of the pinning mode , a resonance should occur .",
    "recent experiments on 2d hole systems @xcite have revealed a resonance structure in the ac absorption spectrum in the low filling factor regime . however , some features of the spectrum were qualitatively different from the predictions of the previous calculations based on charge - density - wave ( cdw ) models ; @xcite namely , ( i ) the peak frequency @xmath4 increased with the magnetic field @xmath5 , and ( ii ) the quality factor @xmath6 was found to be as large as 30 in some data .",
    "@xcite the cdw calculations had predicted that @xmath4 would decrease with @xmath5 and the peak would be much broader ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these puzzling experimental findings were later examined by the authors of refs .",
    "[ ref : chitra98 ] and [ ref : fertig99 ] . based on weak disorder models at @xmath8 , they found that ( i ) was explained if the disorder potential was allowed to vary within a magnetic length @xmath9 .",
    "this short - length - scale physics is missing in the previous cdw calculations since they assume that the disorder potential can vary only in a length scale longer than the lattice periodicity @xmath10 .",
    "( in the experiments in refs .  [ ref : li97 ] , [ ref : li98 ] , and [ ref : hennigan98 ] , @xmath11 . ) more specifically , in ref .  [ ref : fertig99 ] ,",
    "it was suggested that the roughness of the gaas / algaas interface could serve as a source of such a short - length - scale disorder potential .",
    "a `` pit '' on the interface , which is typically several atoms wide , can trap an electron by allowing it to stay closer to the positively charged donor plane and gain electrostatic energy . in a strong magnetic field , one can project the many - body wave function onto the lowest landau level ( lll ) . assuming @xmath12 , one may ignore exchange energy and describe the many - body ground state as a hartree - type product of single electron wave packets of size @xmath13 , which are , in the absence of disorder , located at crystal lattice sites .",
    "@xcite suppose an electron wave packet is situated right on a pit . since its size decreases with increasing @xmath5 , the probability for the electron to stay inside the pit subsequently increases , provided _ the pit size is smaller than @xmath14_. since @xmath4 is essentially given by the expectation value of the pinning potential strength , the above cartoon picture explains how @xmath4 grows with @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , as described below , the long - range coulomb interaction suppresses low - energy collective excitations and leads to a sharp resonance .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "however , thermal fluctuations should broaden the resonance peak .",
    "one important observation is that the peaks measured in experiments keep getting narrower down to the lowest @xmath15 measured .",
    "this suggests that the main source of broadening is thermal fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , the experiments also find that @xmath16 even though @xmath17 .",
    "thus , how the thermal broadening comes about is a highly non - trivial question .",
    "we address the question in this paper . as",
    "the thermal broadening is the main issue , we will simplify the disorder model and assume that the pinning centers themselves form exactly the same lattice as the wc .",
    "we also assume that the impurity potential has the same strength at all sites .",
    "@xcite several different disorder potentials  including the uniform commensurate model we will use in this work  have been studied at @xmath8 in a previous study , @xcite but it was found that the details of disorder do not alter the resonance structure qualitatively .",
    "we believe the thermal behavior is not sensitive to details of disorder , either .    our result can be summarized as follows . in order to understand low , but finite temperature behavior , one needs to investigate the low - energy excitations and their interactions .",
    "the longitudinal and the transverse phonon modes of the wc mix together in a strong magnetic field and two new normal modes , magnetophonons and magnetoplasmons , emerge .",
    "@xcite we focus on the magnetophonons because the energy of the other mode , magnetoplasmons , is essentially given by the cyclotron energy @xmath18 , which is a few orders of magnitude greater than @xmath15 and @xmath4 . in a theory that treats displacement of electrons from lattice sites harmonically , magnetophonons are independent and produces only a delta - function peak in the ac absorption spectrum .",
    "the interaction between magnetophonons comes about from anharmonicity of the hamiltonian .",
    "there are two sources of anharmonicity in our model : coulomb interaction and pinning potential .",
    "since the external ac field has a much larger wave length ( @xmath19 m ) than the size of the system ( typically @xmath20 m ) , @xcite it is safe to treat it as a uniform field that couples only to the center - of - mass degree of freedom .",
    "if the pinning potential is completely harmonic , we find that the anharmonicity in the coulomb interaction does not contribute to the absorption spectrum , because the interaction depends only on the relative position of electrons .",
    "this is analogous to the kohn s theorem , @xcite which states that the electron - electron interaction does not affect the cyclotron frequency in a disorder - free system .",
    "the theorem remains true even in a harmonically pinned wc , therefore , anharmonicity of the pinning potential is crucial for understanding thermal broadening .",
    "as will be shown below , magnetophonon modes are very closely related to angular momentum excitations .",
    "it is therefore natural to exploit analogies to 2d spin lattice systems .",
    "in fact , written in magnetophonon creation and annihilation operators , our model hamiltonian resembles that of an su(n ) schwinger boson formulation of a 2d quantum ( anti-)ferromagnet . @xcite further utilizing this analogy , we use a @xmath0 expansion technique that has proved useful in spin systems . not only",
    "does it provide a systematic way of collecting important processes in feynman diagrams , but also its lowest - order mean - field ( mf ) solution already contains terms that are higher order in coupling constant in a standard diagrammatic many - body calculation .",
    "importantly , the position of absorption resonance peak is mostly determined at the mf level .",
    "the coulomb interaction and the pinning potential affect the spectrum of the magnetophonons significantly . without pinning ,",
    "the dispersion relation is well known to take the form @xmath21 in the long wave length limit , calculated both classically @xcite and quantum mechanically @xcite . in the uniform commensurate pinning model ,",
    "it is modified to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the strength of the pinning potential and @xmath24 is the sound velocity of the magnetophonon mode .",
    "the new spectrum is not only gapped , but also makes the density of states ( dos ) vanish linearly in the low - energy limit .",
    "it turns out that the slope of the low energy dos is so small that there are extremely few low - energy excitation modes about @xmath4 . as a consequence ,",
    "we find that the thermal fluctuations are substantially suppressed and the peak remains sharp .",

    "furthermore , the ground state of the wc in this limit is believed to be well represented by a product of a collection of zero angular momentum single particle wave functions , each of which is centered at a lattice site .",
    "@xcite this is analogous to a hartree wave function .",
    "although the single particle wave functions are not orthogonal , their overlap is exponentially small if @xmath40 .",
    "thus , one may ignore exchange energy correction and the wave functions do not have to be antisymmetrized .",

    "the size of wave packets grow with @xmath27",
    ". however , the above argument should be still valid for the first few higher angular momentum states .",

    "( [ eq : hc2 ] ) , we have dropped not only a constant term , but also the last term that is anharmonic .",
    "in fact , in order to investigate thermal broadening , it is necessary to keep at least one anharmonic term in the hamiltonian , because a completely harmonic hamiltonian would lead to a theory of free independent eigenmodes and all correlation functions would be temperature independent .",
    "however , the anharmonic terms in the coulomb interaction do _ not _ contribute to thermal shift or broadening of the response function to a spatially uniform external perturbation in a harmonic pinning model .",

    "we are led to investigate anharmonicity in the other term in the hamiltonian : the pinning potential .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider only the uniform commensurate pinning model in this work . in reality",
    ", of course , disorder is more complicated in several ways .",
    "first , non - commensurate or non - uniform disorder will break the discrete translational symmetry and deform the lattice .",

[ ref : fertig99 ] that at @xmath8 , the uniform commensurate pinning model yields qualitatively the same result as more complicated disorder models .",
    "furthermore , experimental data show that the resonance peaks keep getting narrower down to @xmath90 , suggesting that thermal fluctuation affects broadening more than disorder does , at least at the observed temperatures .",
    "therefore , we believe this simple disorder model is sufficient for our purpose .    fig .",
    "[ fig : pinning ] shows a schematic picture of the probability function for the three lowest angular momentum states centered at an interface pit .",
    "since states with @xmath91 have little probability to reside in the pit , they are not affected by it .",
    "the pinning hamiltonian is thus appropriately described in terms of magnetophonon operators by @xmath92 where @xmath23 is the amount of energy an electron pays to move from @xmath93 state to a higher angular momentum state _ in the absence of coulomb interaction_. this potential is highly anharmonic , and the resulting phonon problem is exceedingly difficult to analyze . to overcome this",
    ", we adopt an approximate form of the pinning potential .    the simplest choice that includes anharmonicity is @xmath94 which takes the same value as @xmath95 at @xmath96 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "at first , the above hamiltonian looks problematic because it has no lower bound . as will be shown below",
    ", however , the @xmath0 expansion is well defined provided the thermal average @xmath97 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath98 is indeed small and this approximation gives sensible results in the observed temperature range @xmath99 .",

    "[ ref : fertig99 ] by limiting the hilbert space to two angular momentum states per site and writing the hamiltonian in a pseudospin representation .",
    "although the higher - angular - momentum states should not affect low temperature behavior qualitatively , and the assumption that the many - body wave function takes a simple product form breaks down for large @xmath45 , the above hamiltonian has been derived without restricting the hilbert space to a fixed number of states per site .",
    "in this section , we will derive a generalized kohn s theorem , which guarantees that the anharmonicity in the coulomb interaction does not alter the absorption spectrum of a uniform electromagnetic field for a harmonically and uniformly pinned model .",
    "similar generalizations have been made in the context of an electron gas in a parabolic potential in refs .",
    "[ ref : brey89 ] and [ ref : yip91 ] .    before we present the proof ,",
    "let us take a brief look at the original kohn s theorem . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the energy spectrum of a single free electron is simply given by landau levels .",
    "now , suppose that there are many electrons interacting with one another via coulomb or any other interaction .",
    "kohn s theorem tells us that the electromagnetic absorption spectrum of such a system , as measured through a response to a spatially uniform external field , will be exactly the same as that of a single electron .",
    "the proof of this theorem is disarmingly simple .",
    "since the electron - electron interaction depends only on the relative degrees of freedom , it commutes with the center - of - mass motion .",
    "therefore , the observed center - of - mass spectrum is not affected by the interaction at all .",
    "the big difference in the problem considered in this paper is that there is pinning .",
    "however , a similar argument can be established in a special case of harmonic uniform pinning model .",
    "suppose that the pinning hamiltonian takes the form @xmath101 since this hamiltonian is separable in different momenta @xmath102 , its eigenstates may be written as a product of the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is an eigenstate of the center - of - mass operator @xmath105 and @xmath106 of all the other relative degrees of freedom .",

    "since the ac conductivity is determined by the spectrum of @xmath104 alone , it is unaltered by the presence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "this completes the proof of the generalized kohn s theorem .",
    "this theorem implies that if we use a harmonic pinning potential , the contribution from the anharmonic coulomb interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc ] ) to the uniform response function will _ vanish in all orders _ of @xmath112 .",

    "second , using a hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) decoupling technique , the anharmonic terms are replaced by products of a harmonic term and an auxiliary hs field . finally , we expand the magnetophonon green s function in powers of @xmath0 . in principle , the expansion is exact if all orders of @xmath0 are kept . instead ,",

    ", it should be noted that @xmath113 will be set equal to 1 at the end of the approximation , therefore it is not a perturbative expansion in any sense .",
    "however , this technique usually does a better job in systematically picking out important processes than many other many - body techniques .",
    "in fact , the zeroth order approximation , which is a harmonic theory with magnetophonons coupled to the mf value of the hs field , already contains the rpa contribution .",
    "the first order approximation adds self - energy corrections to the green s functions and gives us a thermal broadening .",
