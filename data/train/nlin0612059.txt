    "this paper deals with the parametrically driven , repulsive nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation : @xmath8 here @xmath0  is the strength of the parametric driving and @xmath9  is the damping coefficient . in the absence of damping ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath10 , this equation has the same stationary bloch- and nel - wall solutions as the ( 2:1)-resonantly forced ginzburg - landau equation and the relativistic montonen - sarker - trullinger - bishop model @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the ginzburg - landau and the relativistic model , where only one of these solutions ( the bloch wall ) is linearly stable in their region of coexistence , the nls equation exhibits bloch - nel bistability . furthermore , both domain - wall solutions of the nls ( also known as dark solitons or kinks ) can move with constant velocity , and the moving walls also turn out to be linearly stable @xcite .",
    "this multistability is a rare phenomenon and leads one to wonder about the outcome of the soliton - soliton interaction .",
    "the problem that is of ultimate interest to a physicist , is formulated as follows : given an initial configuration of many different walls , will the asymptotic solution , as @xmath11 , consist of predominantly bloch walls , nel walls or possibly some other , more complicated , structures ? will the walls form widely spaced , equidistant lattices , or tightly bound clusters ? in this paper",
    "we make the first step towards answering these questions .    when @xmath12 , equation ( [ nls ] ) still has a dark soliton solution ( in the form of the nel wall ) ; this solution was shown to be stable for all @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "our analysis of soliton interactions will naturally include the case of nonzero damping , especially in view of the wide range of applications of eq.([nls ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ nls ] ) was indeed derived in a broad variety of physical situations . in fluid dynamics ,",
    "the repulsive ( `` defocusing '' ) parametrically driven nls describes the amplitude of the water surface in a vibrated channel with large width - to - depth ratio @xcite .",
    "( the case of the small width - to - depth ratio gives rise to the attractive nls @xcite . ) the same equation arises as an amplitude equation for the upper cutoff mode in a chain of parametrically driven , damped nonlinear oscillators . in the optical context",
    ", it was derived for the doubly resonant @xmath13 optical parametric oscillator in the limit of large second - harmonic detuning @xcite .",
    "next , stationary solutions of eq.([nls ] ) with @xmath14  minimise the ginzburg - landau free energy of the anisotropic @xmath15-model .",
    "here @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the magnetisation vector whose nontrivial components serve as the real and imaginary parts of the complex field @xmath19 in ( [ nls ] ) : @xmath20 .",
    "this model appeared in studies of stationary domain walls in easy - axis ferromagnets near the curie point @xcite .",
    "_ nonstationary _ magnetisation configurations were considered in the overdamped limit : @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the damped hamiltonian dynamics @xmath22 provides a sensible alternative ; this is precisely our equation ( [ nls ] ) .",
    "finally we note that eq.([nls ] ) also arises in a completely different magnetic context  that of a weakly anisotropic easy - plane ferromagnet in a constant external magnetic field @xcite . here",
    ", the external field ( chosen parallel to the @xmath23-axis ) forces the magnetisation to be almost homogeneous , and eq.([nls ] ) describes small deviations @xmath24   from the uniform magnetisation @xmath25 .",
    "( here @xmath26  is a small parameter . ) in the @xmath15-model , on the other hand , eq.([nls ] ) governs the magnetisation vector itself .",
    "the literature devoted to the interactions of dark solitons and kinks is quite extensive ( although perhaps not as vast as for bright solitons and pulses ) .",
    "kinks are known to attract antikinks in real - valued , single - component klein - gordon equations , such as the sine - gordon and @xmath27-theory @xcite , with and without damping terms @xcite .",
    "the same is true for kinks of the real ginzburg - landau equations @xmath28",
    "these results admit simple interpretations ; the kink - antikink pair converges in order to minimise its total energy in the former case , and to minimise the value of its lyapunov functional in the latter .",
    "next , the dark solitons of the ( undriven ) nls equations are known to repel @xcite .",
    "this can also be understood as an attempt to minimise the energy of the pair , at the expense of the gradient of the phase .",
    "proceeding to the domain - wall solutions of the parametrically driven ginzburg - landau equation @xmath29 the bloch wall and antiwall of opposite chiralities were shown to attract , while those of like chiralities repel @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath30 , the region of stability of bloch walls . ) the nel wall and antiwall always repel in their stability region ( @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "unlike the case without driving , the interpretation of these interactions is not straight - forward though .    as for the driven nls equation ,",
    "the behaviour of its bloch and nel walls is even less predictable at the intuitive level , while the variety of possible interacting partners is much wider due to the multistability .",
    "we will see that the interaction pattern is quite complicated indeed .",
    "the character of interaction ( repulsion vs attraction ) will depend both on the driving strength and the interwall separation .",
    "we will also show that it is influenced by stationary complexes of walls , stable and unstable .",
    "this paper constitutes the first part of our project ; here , we restrict ourselves to interactions of the walls of the same type , i.e. nel - nel and bloch - bloch interactions .",
    "the analysis of the nonsymmetric situations , i.e. nel - bloch interactions , requires a different mathematical formalism and will be presented separately .",
    "( see the following publication @xcite . )",
    "the dynamics of the _ repelling _ solitons is , in a sense , trivial : if the walls are initially at rest , they will simply diverge to the infinities .",
    "less obvious is what the collision of two _ attracting _ walls will result in .",
    "the study of the asymptotic ( as @xmath32 ) attractors arising in the parametrically driven nls constitutes the second objective of our work .",
    "we will show that if the dynamics are dissipative , then , depending on the strength of the driving , colliding walls either annihilate or form a stable stationary bound state .",
    "in contrast to this , undamped collisions will be found to always produce a breather , a spatially localised , temporally oscillating structure .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , the breather propagates or remains motionless , and in either case is found to persist indefinitely .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the two fundamental solutions of eq.([nls ] ) , the bloch and nel wall , are introduced in the next section . for the analysis of the bloch - bloch and nel - nel interaction we use the variational method , under the assumption of well - separated walls .",
    "the method is detailed in section [ variational ] and the resulting finite - dimensional systems are analysed in sections [ neelvar ] , [ oppvar ] , and [ likevar ] .",
    "section [ neelvar ] deals with the nel walls ; section [ oppvar ] is devoted to the bloch walls of the opposite chirality , while the like - chirality walls are examined in section [ likevar ] .",
    "the conclusions of the variational analysis have been verified in direct numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation .",
    "the numerical simulations allow to advance beyond the limit of well - separated walls ; in particular , we use this approach to examine the outcome of soliton collisions . we have allocated a separate section ( section [ simulations ] ) to the nel - nel simulations while the bloch - bloch simulations are reported in sections [ oppvar ] and [ likevar ] , along with the corresponding variational results .",
    "the nontrivial attractors mentioned above  the stationary bound state in the case of dissipative dynamics , and the breather in the undamped system  are further investigated in sections [ dbs ] and [ breathers ] , respectively .",
    "finally , the main results of this work are summarised in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "dark solitons are localised patches of low intensity ( @xmath33 ) in a high intensity background ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the admissible backgrounds are described by the stationary , spatially homogeneous nonzero solutions of eq.([nls ] ) , @xmath35 where @xmath36 as one can easily check , for @xmath37  the zero solution is the only stable background and so dark solitons can only exist for @xmath38 ; this is the condition we are implicitly assuming in this paper .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath39  is stable for all values of @xmath40  while @xmath41  is always unstable .",
    "we will only consider dark solitons existing over the stable background so that all solutions obey @xmath42  as @xmath43 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath44  stands for @xmath45  and @xmath46  for @xmath47  for the rest of the paper",
    ".    it will be convenient to transform eq.([nls ] ) so that the asymptotic solution is independent of @xmath0  and @xmath9 .",
    "to this end , we set @xmath48 ( we have also rescaled the spatial dependence for later convenience . ) under this transformation , eq.([nls ] ) becomes @xmath49 this is the form of the parametrically driven , damped nls that we will be working with in this paper .",
    "the stable background solutions of eq.([nls2 ] ) are simply @xmath50 .",
    "solutions to eq.([nls2 ] ) with @xmath51  as @xmath52   can either be topological @xmath53 $ ]  or nontopological @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "eq.([nls2 ] ) has two explicit topological solitons .",
    "the first is the nel , or ising , wall @xcite : @xmath55 named after the nel wall in magnetism , which is a domain wall with the magnitude of the magnetisation vector vanishing at its centre .",
    "the second topological solution , which exists only for @xmath14 , is usually referred to as the bloch wall @xcite : @xmath56 ( in magnetism , a bloch wall is a domain wall connecting the two domains smoothly , with the magnetisation vector remaining nonzero everywhere . ) in eq.([bloch ] ) , @xmath57 and @xmath58 the solutions obtained by multiplying @xmath59   and @xmath60  by @xmath61  will be called antiwalls , or antikinks .",
    "the bloch wall ( [ bloch ] ) exists in two chiralities . in the bloch wall with positive imaginary part , the phase of the complex field @xmath62  decreases ( that is , the point on the unit circle moves clockwise ) as @xmath63  varies from @xmath64  to @xmath65 . by analogy with the right - hand rule of circular motion",
    ", we refer to this wall as the right - handed bloch wall .",
    "the phase of the bloch wall with negative imaginary part increases as @xmath63   increases ( that is , the phase vector rotates counter - clockwise ) .",
    "this corresponds to a left - handed sense of rotation , so that this wall will be called the left - handed bloch wall .",
    "the antiwall obtained by multiplying @xmath60 by @xmath66 has obviously the same chirality as its parent wall , @xmath60 .",
    "regardless of their chirality , bloch walls only exist for @xmath67 .",
    "in ref.@xcite , it was proved that the nel wall is stable for all @xmath38 .",
    "the stability of the bloch wall in its entire domain of existence was demonstrated numerically @xcite .",
    "examples of _ nontopological _ dark solitons are given by stationary complexes , or bound states , of domain walls .",
    "these can be formed by two dissipative nel walls , or by a bloch and nel wall  in the undamped situation .",
    "( see @xcite . ) in condensed matter physics , these nontopological solitons describe bubbles of one thermodynamic phase in another one @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we will occassionally be referring to bound states of domain walls as solitonic bubbles .",
    "in this paper , we will be paying special attention to the simplest situation where the interacting walls are initially at rest .",
    "choosing the origin of the coordinate axis midway between two bloch or two nel walls , one can verify that the subsequent evolution will preserve this symmetric arrangement ( see below ) .",
    "a symmetric pair of well separated walls can be approximated by a product function    [ ansatz ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent the individual walls in the pair : @xmath71 }     - i\\kappa_1 \\mbox{sech } [ { \\cal b } ( x+z ) ] ,    \\label{convenience1 } \\\\    \\varphi_2(x , t)=\\tanh{[{\\cal b } ( x - z ) ] }   + i\\kappa_2 \\mbox{sech } [ { \\cal b } ( x - z ) ] .     \\label{convenience2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq.([ansatz ] ) , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are time - dependent parameters accounting for the deformation of the walls due to their interaction .",
    "the variable @xmath74 gives half the distance between the walls ; without loss of generality , we take @xmath23 to be positive . finally , the constant @xmath75 characterises the width of the walls ( @xmath76 for bloch walls and @xmath77 for nel walls ) .    our analysis is based on the variational method . for this method ,",
    "we substitute the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into the action integral that gives rise to eq.([nls2 ] ) : @xmath78 where    @xmath79 + \\frac{i\\gamma}{2 } \\left[\\psi^2 - ( \\psi^*)^2\\right ]   - \\frac{a^2}{2 } \\right\\ } dx . \\label{lagrange}\\ ] ]    in what follows we introduce a small parameter @xmath80 . integrating off the explicit @xmath63-dependence in ( [ lagrange ] ) ,",

    "the stationary action principle @xmath85 yields then the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath86 and @xmath23 . in deriving ( [ tt])-([vv ] )",
    "we neglected all powers of @xmath26 higher than @xmath87 .",
    "one can readily check that such terms would produce only higher - order corrections in the resulting equations of motion .",
    "some comments must be made regarding the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "after a variational ansatz has been substituted in the corresponding field lagrangian and the @xmath63-dependence integrated away , all dynamical variables ( or possibly their combinations ) can be grouped into canonically - conjugate pairs .",
    "( see @xcite for review and references . ) in particular , if the waveform consists of _ two _ solitary waves and the separation between two constituents , @xmath88 , is chosen as one of the variables , the conjugate momentum is the phase gradient .",
    "this fact is well known in the case where the constituents are bell - shaped (  bright \" ) solitons ( see e.g. @xcite ) . that it remains true in a more general situation",
    "can be seen from an analogy with quantum mechanics where the momentum of the system is given by an eigenvalue of the operator @xmath89 .",
    "( since the eigenvalue has to be real , the operator acts just on the phase of the eigenfunction while the modulus is taken to be constant . )",
    "another simple analogy arises if we write @xmath90 ; this polar decomposition casts eq.([nls ] ) with @xmath91 in the form of equations of gas dynamics , where @xmath92 is the density of the gas and @xmath93 is its velocity , proportional to the momentum .    in the case of bright solitons ,",
    "each constituent soliton in the ansatz is usually multiplied by @xmath94 ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; then , the momentum conjugate to @xmath23 is @xmath95 .",
    "however , in the case of kinks this simple recipe would violate the boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "for this reason we have introduced the phase gradient by allowing the imaginary parts @xmath96 $ ]   of the kinks to be variable .",
    "the imaginary parts decay as @xmath97 and therefore making them variable is compatible with the boundary conditions .",
    "below , we will show that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are indeed momenta canonically conjugate to @xmath23 .",
    "another reason for introducing the phase gradient in this way is a simple interpretation of the finite - dimensional momenta @xmath72 and @xmath73 in terms of the original fields @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , these variables coincide , modulo a numerical coefficient , with the _ field momenta _ of the two walls .",
    "the field momentum integral has the form @xmath99 for the undamped nls [ equation ( [ nls2 ] ) with @xmath10 ] , the integral ( [ momentum ] ) is conserved .",
    "the field momentum of the nel wall ( [ neel ] ) equals zero , while that of the bloch wall ( [ bloch ] ) is given by @xmath101 .",
    "[ the same sign convention is used here as for eq.([bloch ] )  the top sign applies for the right - handed wall , while the bottom sign corresponds to the left - handed wall . ] it is not difficult to check that the field momenta of the perturbed walls @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the configuration ( [ ansatz ] ) are @xmath102=\\pi \\kappa_1 $ ] and @xmath103=-\\pi \\kappa_2 $ ] .    in symmetric situations that we are concerned with , the variables @xmath72  and @xmath73 ( both of which are conjugate to the same coordinate variable @xmath23 ) will eventually turn out to be related due to the equations of motion .",
    "the calculations simplify , however , if this relationship is established yet at the level of the lagrangian ( [ lll ] ) , that is , before the equations of motion have been derived .",
    "the relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath73 depends on the type of walls being considered .",
    "if the initial configuration consists of two well - separated nel walls at rest , or two quiescent distant bloch walls of _ opposite _ chirality , we have a symmetry @xmath104 .",
    "since equation ( [ nls2 ] ) is parity - invariant , the subsequent evolution will preserve this symmetry . substituting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into @xmath105",
    ", we get @xmath106 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath107  should be chosen close to zero for nel walls and close to @xmath108 for bloch walls [ with the sign of @xmath109 depending on whether the wall placed on the right is right- or left - handed . ]",
    "if the initial configuration consists of two quiescent bloch walls of _ like _ chirality , the relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath73 is not so trivial to establish .",
    "the reason is that equation ( [ nls2 ] ) _ does not _ preserve the symmetry @xmath110 of the initial condition . in this case",
    "we have to appeal to the field - momentum considerations rather than symmetries . substituting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into the integral ( [ momentum ] ) , we find that @xmath111 = \\pi ( \\kappa_1 - \\kappa_2 ) [ 1 + \\mathcal{o}(e^{-2 { \\cal b } z})]$ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the total momentum of two like - chirality walls which are initially at rest and far away from each other , should be near @xmath112 . therefore , for moving walls the quantity @xmath113 must not be different from @xmath114 by more than @xmath115 .",
    "this is accomplished by letting @xmath116  and @xmath117 .",
    "when @xmath23 is large , the perturbation @xmath118 is small  but not necessarily as small as @xmath26 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations corresponding to eqs.([s_cal]),([lll ] ) are    [ el_0 ] @xmath119 and @xmath120    in eq.([first el ] ) , we assumed the situation of @xmath121 ( that is , two nel or two oppositely - handed bloch walls ) . in the other case , i.e. when we have two bloch walls of like chirality ,",
    "@xmath122  should be replaced by @xmath123  in eq.([first el ] ) .",
    "the integrals @xmath124  and @xmath125  can both be found explicitly and simplified assuming wide separation of the walls .",
    "finally , we note that the variational method is not well suited for the analysis of the bloch - nel interaction .",
    "the reason for this is that the bloch and nel walls have different widths , leading to terms in the lagrangian which are not periodic along the imaginary axis on the plane of complex @xmath63 ; as a result , the lagrangian can not be obtained in closed form .",
    "( when the walls have the same width , the integrals can all be evaluated by integration along the rectangular contour with one side on the real axis and the other on the line @xmath126 . )",
    "consequently , we had to resort to a different approach for the analysis of the nel - bloch interaction ( see paper ii of this project @xcite . )",
    "the resulting phenomenology is also very different @xcite .",
    "in this case , we let @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in equations ( [ el_0 ] )",
    "we discard products of powers of small quantities @xmath26 and @xmath122 for which there are larger counterparts .",
    "for instance , we drop a term proportional to @xmath129 from an equation which already has a term @xmath130 with a nonsmall coefficient . here",
    "we keep in mind that in some cases the damping @xmath9 and the difference @xmath131 can be small parameters , hence we can not drop @xmath129 in favour of the term @xmath132 or @xmath133 . with these simplifications , equations ( [ first el])-([second el ] )",
    "take the form    [ general ] @xmath134    the subsequent analysis depends on the relation between the damping and driving in the system .",
    "first we consider the case where @xmath9 is not small .",
    "assume , in addition , that @xmath136  is not close to @xmath137 .",
    "( later in this subsection we will explore the situation where @xmath131 is small . ) in this case the terms in the second lines of ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) are smaller than those in the first lines and can be neglected .",
    "the equations simplify to    [ ga_large ] @xmath138    since @xmath122 is small , the variable @xmath139  varies very slowly , @xmath140 . on the other hand , the variable @xmath141 will initially change on a much faster scale . within the time @xmath142  it will ",
    "zap \" onto the nullcline @xmath143 after which the point @xmath144 will be slowly moving along this parabola . according to eq.([ga_large_1 ] ) , it will move towards greater @xmath26 ( i.e. the separation @xmath145 will decrease ) if @xmath146 and to smaller @xmath26 if @xmath147 .",
    "that is , the walls will attract if @xmath146 and repel if @xmath147 .",
    "note that this criterion is consistent with results for the undamped , undriven case ( @xmath10 , @xmath148 ) where the dark solitons are known to repel @xcite .",
    "since the above criterion has been derived under the assumption that @xmath136 is not very close to @xmath149 , the value @xmath150 provides only a rough watershed between the two types of interaction . in order to establish a more accurate borderline , we zoom in on a narrow strip along the line @xmath150 on the @xmath151-plane .",
    "assuming that @xmath152 is small ( while @xmath9 is not ) , eq.([ga_large_1 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath153 substituting ( [ parabola ] ) into ( [ 310 ] ) and dropping an @xmath154 term , we obtain a one - dimensional dynamical system @xmath155 when @xmath156 , @xmath139 tends to zero for all @xmath157 . for @xmath158 , the system ( [ bsg ] )",
    "has a stable fixed point at @xmath159 this fixed point corresponds to a stable bound state of two nel walls .",
    "when @xmath136 approaches @xmath149 , the distance @xmath160 between the walls in this bound state tends to infinity and so the bound state does not exist for @xmath136 smaller than @xmath149 .",
    "this means that @xmath161 is , in fact , an _ accurate _ borderline between the two types of behaviour . for @xmath156 ,",
    "two walls repel whereas for @xmath146 , the walls attract  except for @xmath136 close to @xmath149 , in which case they form a stable bound state .",
    "we should emphasise here that our present conclusions pertain only to distant walls . in order to extend our understanding of the nel wall dynamics beyond the limit of _ very _ small @xmath26",
    ", one has to analyse the dynamical system ( [ general ] ) without neglecting any powers of @xmath26 and @xmath122 in it .",
    "this will be done numerically in section [ numerical_fp ] below .",
    "we will show , in particular , that in addition to the stable bound state of two walls , there is also an unstable complex  at a shorter distance .",
    "when @xmath9 is small , the system ( [ general ] ) becomes    [ small_gamma ] @xmath163    for either sign of @xmath164 , the origin is the only fixed point in the system .",
    "noting that the @xmath122-axis ( @xmath165 ) is an invariant manifold flowing into the fixed point and calculating the index of the vector field ( [ small_gamma ] ) along the semicircle @xmath166 , @xmath167 , with @xmath168 , we conclude that the fixed point is a stable node for @xmath156 and a saddle for @xmath146 .",
    "hence , for @xmath156 , all trajectories tend to the origin as @xmath32 [ fig.[ibfig1](a ) ] , i.e. , the walls repel .    for @xmath146 ,",
    "all trajectories fly away to infinity [ fig.[ibfig1](b ) ] implying the attraction of the walls .",
    "one may wonder whether some trajectories coming from the lower half of the phase plane , could flow into the origin ( tangent to the vertical axis . )",
    "a simple analysis of trajectories in a small neighbourhood of the origin shows that such behaviour is , in fact , impossible .",
    "trajectories which seem to be approaching the point @xmath169 close to the @xmath122-axis , do turn away when they are a small distance away from the origin .",
    "this is illustrated by fig.[ibfig1](c ) which gives a blow - up of a small neighbourhood of the fixed point .    in the next subsection",
    ", we will zoom in on a small neighbourhood of @xmath170 to draw a sharper boundary between domains of the opposite types of interaction  similar to the way we have done it for large @xmath9 .",
    "we should also mention here that , as in the previous subsection , our current conclusions pertain to walls with large separations .    the undamped case , @xmath171 ,",
    "is exceptional ; in this case , the entire @xmath122-axis is a line of fixed points  they represent pairs of infinitely separated walls moving at constant velocities . for @xmath156 ,",
    "the points with @xmath172 are stable and those with @xmath173 unstable .",
    "trajectories have the form of arcs starting on the lower semiaxis and flowing into points on the upper semiaxis : @xmath174 , @xmath175   as @xmath11 [ fig.[ibfig11](a ) ] .",

    "( see the concluding section for a possible explanation of the  nonvisibility \" of these objects . )",
    "finally , we examine the case of a pair of bloch walls ( more precisely , a wall and an antiwall ) of the same chirality . as in the previous section ,",

    "when at rest , the well - separated wall and antiwall have equal ( nonzero ) momenta @xmath353 where @xmath313  is as in ( [ kappa_0 ] ) .",
    "when the walls start moving as a result of their interaction , the total momentum remains the same and hence the individual field momenta of the two walls will change by the same amount : one will become @xmath354 and the other one @xmath355 .",
    "this means that one of the walls will have the amplitude of its imaginary part increase by @xmath123 and the other one decrease by @xmath123 , and so we will not have a symmetric configuration of an equal - amplitude wall and antiwall any longer .",
    "therefore one may question the validity of our assumption that the two walls remain equal distance away from the origin for @xmath356 . to see that the equal - distance ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) remains valid",
    " at least for not too late times  we note that the velocity - momentum curve @xmath357 of a single bloch wall has a nonzero slope at the point @xmath358 , @xmath359 ( see @xcite ; the curve is also reproduced in part ii of the present series of papers @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the wall whose momentum has increased by @xmath360 , acquires the velocity @xmath361 , while the wall whose momentum has decreased by @xmath360 , starts moving with the velocity @xmath362 where @xmath363 .",
    "accordingly , if two walls are equal distance from the origin initially , they will remain equally far from the origin for all @xmath364 .",
    "this symmetric arrangement will break down only if @xmath365 is very large or if @xmath366 is very small , in which case one would have to take into account deviations of the shape of the @xmath357 curve from a straight line .",

    "letting @xmath368 , @xmath369   and @xmath76 in the lagrangian ( [ lll ] ) , we get equations describing the dynamics of two like - chirality bloch walls . these can be written as a hamiltonian system    [ hami_b ] @xmath370 where @xmath371>0 \\ ] ] and the hamiltonian @xmath372 \\\\ + 16",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ h_like ] ) with small @xmath26 and @xmath123 is dominated just by two terms , @xmath373 as in the previous section , the @xmath123-axis in this case is a line of nonisolated fixed points .",
    "since @xmath374 , points with @xmath375 and @xmath376 represent pairs of converging and diverging walls , respectively .",
    "the trajectories are parabolas @xmath377 ; they start at points on the positive-@xmath123 semiaxis and flow into points on the negative-@xmath123 semiaxis .",
    "this implies that the initially diverging walls continue to diverge whereas the walls initially moving towards each other shall stop at some finite separation , and then repel to infinities .",
    "( a simple but practically important situation concerns walls which are initially at rest ; these will obviously start repelling straight away . )",
    "the above conclusion applies , of course , only to slowly moving walls which are sufficiently far from each other [ i.e. @xmath157 and @xmath378 are small ] .",
    "fig.[like](a ) displays a typical result of direct numerical simulation of the interaction of two like - chirality bloch walls within eq.([nls2 ] ) .",
    "we tested several values of @xmath0 and a variety of @xmath379 .",
    "the initial condition was taken in the form ( [ ansatz ] ) with @xmath380 and @xmath381 . in agreement with conclusions of the variational analysis ,",
    "the initially quiescent walls were observed to repel for all @xmath0 not very close to @xmath326 .",
    "( the case of @xmath0 close to @xmath326 is discussed below . )",
    "as @xmath0 tends to zero , the phase portrait does not undergo any qualitative changes .",
    "however , the turning point of the parabola starting at a point @xmath382 on the @xmath123-axis , @xmath383 , is shifted out of the small-@xmath26 region , i.e. out of the range of applicability of variational approximation .",
    "consequently , we can no longer expect the initially converging walls to stop a large distance away from each other and repel to infinities after that . instead , for @xmath384 the colliding like - chirality bloch walls should penetrate into the core of each other , and the numerical simulations of the full pde could be the only way to study the outcome of this deep impact .",
    "next , let @xmath0 be near @xmath326 . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h_like ] ) with small @xmath26 and @xmath123 reduces to @xmath385 the dynamics with very small @xmath26 and @xmath123 is similar to the one described by eq.([hzq ] ) : distant pairs of walls with @xmath386 diverge while those which are initially set to converge ( @xmath387 ) slow down , stop and then repel to infinities [ fig.[fig9](a ) ] . a new feature in the ( @xmath272)-case is a saddle point at @xmath388 and a region of attraction which is separated from the region of repulsion by the stable manifold of the saddle [ fig.[fig9](a ) ] .",
    "this fixed point was previously discovered in a variational analysis of the ( 2:1)-resonantly forced ginsburg - landau equation @xcite . although it would be tempting to think that it represents a stationary complex of two bloch walls of like chiralities , the actual interpretation of the stationary point turns out to be somewhat different .",
    "indeed , it was proved in @xcite that in the absence of damping , two bloch or two nel walls can not form stationary complexes . on the other hand , letting @xmath389 and @xmath390 with small @xmath313 , the trial function ( [ ansatz ] ) can be written , approximately , as @xmath391 this coincides with the expression for the bloch - nel bound state \\{eq.(11 ) of ref.@xcite } with @xmath392and @xmath393 , where we only need to send @xmath394   and make the identification @xmath395 . therefore , the  bound state \" of two like - chirality bloch walls produced by the variational analysis is , in fact , the bloch - nel complex with @xmath396 .",
    "the reason why the bloch - nel complex could be mistaken for a complex of two bloch walls , was simply because the bloch and nel walls become indistinguishable as @xmath367 .",
    "the appearance of the region of attraction for @xmath0 close to @xmath326 deserves a special comment .",
    "the attraction becomes possible due to the smallness of @xmath313 in this limit .",
    "indeed , for sufficiently small @xmath313 , the momentum @xmath397 becomes close to @xmath398  which is characteristic for two bloch walls of _ opposite _ chirality .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath367 , the walls may effectively change their chiralities .",
    "it is instructive to consider the full phase portrait of the system ( [ hami_b ] ) ; we produce it by plotting level curves of the hamiltonian ( [ h_like ] ) beyond the region of small @xmath26 and @xmath122 [ fig.[fig9](b ) ] .",
    "a remarkable feature here is a family of closed orbits surrounding a nonlinear - center point .",
    "the center is born , along with the saddle point , in a saddle - center bifurcation as @xmath0 is increased past @xmath399 .",
    "the presence of periodic orbits suggests that breathers may be formed in the collision of bloch walls of like chirality .    as @xmath367 , the saddle point @xmath400 moves closer to the origin and",
    "so the periodic orbits pass near @xmath165 .",
    "accordingly , in this limit the breathers should be accessible from initial conditions in the form of well - separated pairs of walls .",
    "we note , however , that all closed orbits pass also through a region of large @xmath26 .",
    "[ in fact , as @xmath367 , the coordinate of the nonlinear center tends to infinity : @xmath401 . ] consequently , the formation of the breathers requires accurate testing within the full pde . in our numerical simulations with @xmath0 close to @xmath326",
    ", we have indeed observed the attraction of walls with moderate separations ( e.g. with @xmath402 in the case of @xmath403 and @xmath404 in the case of @xmath405 ) followed by the formation of a breather [ fig.[like](b ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the attraction of two like - chirality walls with @xmath406 proceeds via the chirality transmutation : first , one of the walls changes its chirality to the opposite ; after that , the two opposite - chirality walls attract .",
    "finally , we need to mention an anomaly in the interaction of two like - chirality walls which was observed in some of our simulations with @xmath0 near @xmath326 . the walls which are initially at rest and equal distance away from the origin , would start moving with different velocities or even in the same direction  violating our ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) based on the assumption of a symmetric arrangement for all @xmath84 .",
    "this asymmetric anomaly is observed in a wider range of @xmath0-values near @xmath407 than the chirality transmutation ( we detected the former for @xmath0 as far from @xmath326 as @xmath408 ) and has a straightfoward explanation in terms of the @xmath357 curve . as @xmath367",
    ", the derivative @xmath409 tends to infinity at the points where the @xmath410-shaped @xmath357-curve intersects the @xmath411-axis and so the equation @xmath412 has to be amended by keeping the symmetry - breaking term in @xmath413 .",
    "it is this term that causes the asymmetric motion of the two walls .",
    "the anomalous interaction is typical for bloch - nel pairs and can be interpreted as the interaction of particles with the opposite mass sign @xcite .",
    "the fact that the motion of two walls has to be asymmetric becomes even more obvious if one notices that the left and right turning points of the @xmath410-curve approach @xmath358 as @xmath367 . as a result",
    ", the motion in the direction of the turning point becomes hampered .",
    "when @xmath0 is _ extremely _ close to @xmath326 , a new channel of interaction becomes available ; namely , the wall which is repelled by its partner in the  hard \" direction , may ",
    "tunnel \" through the @xmath357-barrier by means of the chirality transmutation , and the original symmetric arrangement remains undisturbed .",
    "in the nondissipative situation ( @xmath14 ) , colliding walls form a moving or quiescent breather : a temporally oscillating , spatially localised structure .",
    "the breather was formed , for at least a short time , in every undamped collision that we simulated .",
    "the formation of the breather is accompanied by the release of a large amount of radiation ; the numerical simulations reveal that the breather carries only about a quarter of the energy of the initial configuration , and so the remaining three quarters must escape into the radiation field . as a result ,",
    "when the interval of simulation is too short , the interaction of the breather with the radiation re - entering the interval via the periodic boundaries is strong enough to destroy it after just a few oscillations . on a large interval , however , the amplitude of the re - entering radiation is small due to the dispersive broadening , and the breather persists indefinitely .",
    "the breather can be easily constructed perturbatively .",
    "first of all , a harmonic solution @xmath414  of the nls ( [ nls2 ] ) linearised about @xmath415 obeys the dispersion relation @xmath416 the @xmath417-harmonic oscillates with a nonzero frequency @xmath418 ; therefore , one may also expect to find a broad small - amplitude breather oscillating with that frequency .",

    "when @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath326 , the walls repel .",
    "the exception here is the case where @xmath0 is close to @xmath326 ; in this case walls with very large separations repel whereas walls which are not so far from each other , attract .    in the dissipation - free case",
    ", the available dark solitons also include bloch walls .",
    "the interaction between two bloch walls depends on their relative chiralities : two initially quiescent , oppositely - handed bloch walls attract while two quiescent walls with like chiralities placed at a large distance away from each other , repel .",
    "the exception is the case of @xmath0 close to @xmath326 ; in this limit , two walls of like chirality repel at large distances but exhibit anomalous interaction or transmute into an opposite - chirality pair and attract  when placed closer to each other .",
    "these conclusions can be extended to the case of the _ moving _ bloch walls , where one just needs to take their inertia into account .",
    "for example , two initially diverging oppositely - handed walls at large separation will continue to diverge despite the attraction whereas two likely - handed walls which were initially moving against each other , will continue to converge ( until the repulsion stops them and sends away to infinities ) .",
    "in addition to the interactions between well - separated walls , we investigated products of their collision .",
    "when the system is not damped , the collision of two walls results in a stationary or travelling breather .",
    "we reconstructed the numerically found breather as an asymptotic series .    when @xmath9 is nonzero , oscillations are damped and the only nontrivial product of collision of two nel walls is a stationary bubble  the bound state of two nel walls .",

    "the numerical demarcation is in excellent agreement with the domain of existence obtained variationally .",
    "we complete the paper by listing several open problems to which we plan to return in future . one interesting problem that merits further investigation , concerns the ( unstable ) bubble solution with small @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "( this solution is exemplified by fig.[weird_bubble ] . )",
    "our numerics and the variational analysis in section [ numerical_fp ] show that this solution _ can not _ be regarded as a complex of two nel walls , not even strongly overlapping ones .",
    "its asymptotic behaviour is closer to that of a bloch wall ; however , bloch walls do not exist in presence of damping .",
    "furthermore , the bubble can not be continued to @xmath10 and hence does not have a nondissipative analogue in the form of a bound state of two bloch , or a bloch and a nel , walls .",
    "( this follows from the fact that the nel wall is the only solution in the @xmath10 domain which admits continuation to nonzero @xmath9 as it is the only solution with zero momentum @xcite . )",
    "thus a question arises whether the bubble with small @xmath0 and @xmath9 could be interpreted as a complex of two hypothetical  dissipative bloch walls \" of opposite chiralities  which do not exist individually but can exist as a bound state due to the cancellation of their opposite momenta .",
    "a similar momentum cancellation occurs in the attractive damped - driven nls where it allows complexes to travel with nonzero speeds despite the fact that their constituent solitons are immobile @xcite .    a related question concerns the short - distance nel wall dynamics with small @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "this problem is inaccessible to the variational method , and the direct numerical simulations of the full pde seems to be the only appropriate line of attack here .",
    "\\2 . with regard to the bloch walls ,",
    "an open problem concerns the family of closed orbits centred on @xmath179 in fig.[schweik ] .",
    "when @xmath0 is close to @xmath326 , these periodic orbits can be interpreted within the full partial differential equation ( [ nls ] ) , as pairs of opposite - chirality bloch walls executing periodic oscillations of their separation .",
    "it is not impossible that these periodic solutions exist also for @xmath0 not so close to @xmath326 [ where the validity of the well - separated ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) becomes questionable . ]",
    "it remains to be understood why these orbits have not been observed in our numerical simulations of eq.([nls ] ) , with either @xmath0 .",
    "one possible explanation stems from the fact that the nonlinear - center fixed point enclosed by this family of closed orbits , corresponds to a _",
    "maximum _ of the energy ( [ vv ] ) .",
    "consequently , the nonlinear modes not captured by our two - dimensional ansatz ( [ ansatz ] )  such as radiations  should make the point @xmath462 slide downhill towards orbits with larger radii , until it crosses through the homoclinic trajectory and ends up at @xmath165 .",
    "[ it is pertinent to note here that the centre points enclosed by the other two families of closed orbits in fig.[schweik ] are _ minima _ of the energy ( [ vv ] ) ; this is consistent with the stability of the corresponding breather solutions observed in numerical simulations in section [ simulations ] . ]",
    "next , it would be interesting to simulate collisions of the like - chirality bloch walls with @xmath384 .",
