    "the single species vlasov - poisson system is a nonlinear kinetic system that models time evolution of a collisionless plasma consisting of electrons and a uniform background of fixed ions under the effects of a self - consistent electrostatic field and possibly an externally supplied field .",
    "the vlasov equation models the transport of the electrons that are coupled to the electrostatic potential through poisson s equation .",
    "the unknown electron distribution function , a phase space density , is denoted by @xmath0 where the independent variables @xmath1 are position , velocity , and time , respectively . for a given @xmath2 , the quantity @xmath3 denotes the number of electrons contained in the infinitesimal phase space volume element @xmath4 centered about @xmath5 at time @xmath2 . upon a proper renormalization",
    ", @xmath6 can be interpreted as a probability distribution function for the electrons over the phase space .",
    "the vlasov - poisson system has solutions that can exhibit a variety of dynamical phenomena @xcite .",
    "one of the most well - known effects is filamentation or ` phase mixing ' as it is sometimes called , which occurs when different characteristics surfaces associated to the nonlinear transport ( vlasov ) equation wrap in the phase space .",
    "this effect results in stiff gradients , since @xmath6 generally takes on disparate values along different characteristics .",
    "related to filamentation is the interesting phenomenon of landau damping @xcite : electrostatic disturbances can be interpreted as the interaction between plasma waves and electrons with a resulting net energy transfer from the wave to electrons leading to an exponential collisionless damping of the electric field modes in time .",
    "because of such phenomena , the vlasov - poisson equation can be challenging to simulate numerically .",
    "existing numerical techniques for solving the vlasov - poisson system can be divided into two groups : ( i ) those that approximate the system in the phase space directly and ( ii ) those that transform the system into a different coordinate space .",
    "the numerical approaches that treat the phase space directly do not , however , usually involve discretizing the vlasov equation .",
    "rather most of these methods take advantage of the characteristic structure of the vlasov equation , which implies that the plasma particles evolve along trajectories that satisfy a given set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the most widely used particle scheme is the particle - in - cell ( pic ) method @xcite , which represents ensembles micro - particles as a finite number of macro - particles .",
    "each macro - particle is then assumed to evolve along a characteristic trajectory , where the electric field defining the trajectory is computed via any standard scheme .",
    "the pic method seems to give reasonable results in cases where the tail of the distribution is negligible and a large number of particles is not necessary .",
    "otherwise , the method suffers from numerical noise that is proportional to @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of particles .",
    "other methods based on the discretization of the phase space have also been proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "an operator splitting method was introduced and shown to be both efficient and accurate for solving a wide range of problems .",
    "a continuous finite element method was developed in @xcite and was shown to achieve results similar to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "a positive and mass conservative scheme was employed in @xcite to solve both linear and nonlinear damping problems in one- and two - dimensional physical space .",
    "this method is defined at a given time step by first building a piecewise constant approximation over a mesh of the phase space using the approximation obtained from the previous time step and two correction terms whose values are found by solving two fixed point problems . the piecewise approximation is then used in conjunction with a slope limiter to reconstruct a local polynomial approximation of @xmath6 for each cell in the mesh .    transform methods based on fourier or hermite series have also been used , e.g.  in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the phase space was transformed using a fourier transform and a splitting method was employed to advance the approximation in time .",
    "this method also included a filamentation filtering step for the purpose of smoothening the filaments .",
    "the numerical results obtained using this method seem reasonable only for problems in which filamentation is not a dominant effect , where perhaps the nonlinearity either slows down or prevents the onset of filamentation",
    ". however , this method may be inadequate for problems where the physics of interest depends upon the filamentary nature of the distribution , such as is the case for landau damping .",
    "the objective of this paper is to propose a coupled upwind penalty galerkin ( upg ) method for the approximation of the vlasov - poisson system and to evaluate its numerical efficacy .",
    "our upg method gives a unified approach for approximating both the hyperbolic and elliptic parts of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "specifically , the vlasov equation is discretized using the standard upwind galerkin ( ug ) scheme for conservation laws @xcite and the poisson equation is discretized using one of the three discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) interior penalty available schemes @xcite .",
    "stability and convergence estimates for the upg method were presented in @xcite for the six - dimensional phase space in the same reference , the method was shown to be both locally and globally mass conservative .",
    "more specifically , the semi - discrete upg approximation @xmath9 to the electron distribution function is defined to be the solution of a first - order , nonlinear , ordinary differential equation ( ode ) system .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the method preserves positivity of @xmath9 when piecewise constants basis functions are used to approximate the solution to the vlasov - poisson system .    in this manuscript",
    "we show the numerical efficacy of the dg method by performing accuracy , convergence , and conservation tests on computed upg approximate solutions to a variety of linear and nonlinear problems where sufficiently data or information of the true nonlinear solutions has been established .",
    "the computed results for these problems are benchmarked against known theoretical results and are compared to results obtained using established methods .    for computing plasma problems the upg method offers several advantages .",
    "in particular , the local nature of the method facilitates adaptive mesh refinements with easy adaptation to parallelization techniques . by taking advantage of these benefits , regions of the phase space where",
    "the electron distribution experiences strong filamentation or boundary layer effects can be resolved by local mesh refinements .",
    "the discontinuous nature of the method also helps to resolve the stiff gradients associated with filamentation , since requiring the approximation to be continuous in these cases can be too restrictive and typically lead to excessive numerical diffusion and oscillatory behavior . due to the fact that the method imposes boundary conditions weakly",
    ", a variety of boundary conditions can easily be accommodated .",
    "recently , an alternative dg formulation for the boltzmann - poisson system was introduced in @xcite for simulations of hot electron transport for one and two space dimensional nanometer scale devices , where kinetic corrections are known to be very significant . in @xcite",
    "a dg scheme was constructed for the vlasov - boltzmann equation by means of a maximum principle satisfying a limiter for conservation laws @xcite , and it was shown to be high order accurate and positivity - preserving , not only for piecewise constant basis functions but also for higher order polynomial approximations .",
    "consequently a new approximation of the vlasov system based on a upg scheme for higher order polynomial basis functions is currently being developed and tested @xcite .",
    "thus , the dg method is well - suited to approximate a range of plasmas spanning from the collisionless to the highly collisional regimes .    for completeness of this introduction",
    "we include some historical remarks regarding dg methods .",
    "the initial development of these numerical approximating schemes for hyperbolic and elliptic equations occurred independently , but nearly simultaneously . in 1973 , the first dg scheme for linear hyperbolic equations was introduced by reed and hill for approximating a neutron transport equation @xcite .",
    "this work was followed by lesaint and raviart @xcite in 1974 , where _ a priori _ error estimates were proved for the dg method applied to two - dimensional , linear hyperbolic problems .",
    "the dg schemes for hyperbolic problems were further studied in the series of papers @xcite , which culminated in the introduction of the local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) method @xcite .",
    "the generality of the ldg method was further extended to the multidimensional setting under more relaxed assumptions on the data in @xcite .",
    "one of the first dg schemes for approximating the solutions to second - order elliptic equations was introduced in 1971 by nitsche @xcite where dirichlet boundary conditions were enforced weakly rather than strongly through the use of a penalty term .",
    "shortly thereafter , applications of the penalty method to laplace s equation were proposed by babuka et al .   in @xcite .",
    "the use of penalty terms across interior faces as a means of enforcing continuity among adjacent elements was introduced in @xcite and @xcite using a symmetric interior penalty galerkin ( sipg ) finite element method .",
    "a non - symmetric interior penalty method ( nipg ) similar to the sipg method was proposed and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the incomplete interior penalty method ( iipg ) was introduced in @xcite and is very similar to the sipg and nipg methods .",

    "sect : conclusions ] , we comment on the efficiency of the upg method , draw some conclusions , and remark on future work .",

    "in this section , we derive the upg method for the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "the derivation proceeds by first discretizing the vlasov equation using the standard ug discretization for transport equations @xcite .",
    "here it is assumed that the electric field is given and hence the divergence - free flow field @xmath67 , defined in for the vlasov equation , is known .",
    "afterwards , the dg discretization for the poisson equation is considered .",
    "it is assumed that any mesh for the phase space , where by mesh we mean a partitioning of the phase space into convex sets called elements , is the cartesian cross product of a mesh for the physical domain and a mesh for the velocity domain . under this assumption",
    ", the physical and velocity domains can be independently refined . given a mesh for the phase space",
    ", the ug method then defines an approximate solution to the true vlasov solution in such a way that at any given time the approximate solution restricted to each element of the mesh is a polynomial function .",
    "however , the approximate solution is not required to be continuous across the intersections of any two adjacent elements , so it is a piecewise defined polynomial function with respect to the mesh at any given time .    in order to compute the approximation to the electrostatic potential from poisson s equation , for a given distribution function",
    ", one may use one of three interior penalty methods that weakly enforce both approximate continuity across the interior mesh faces and dirichlet boundary regions .",
    "these three alternative methods , symmetric interior penalty galerkin ( sipg ) @xcite , non - symmetric interior penalty galerkin ( nipg ) @xcite , and incomplete interior penalty galerkin ( iipg ) @xcite are discussed in detail and _ a priori _ error estimates for each of them are given in the respective references .",
    "the only difference among the three methods is in the value of one specific parameter that arises in the weak formulation that is common to each of them .",
    "thus , for a given space charge function , each penalty galerkin method defines a piecewise polynomial approximation of the true solution to the poisson equation using a mesh in the spatial domain .",
    "the spatial domain mesh used in the discretization of poisson s equation is required to be the same as that used in the ug discretization of the vlasov equation .",
    "this requirement is a practical one , both in terms of analysis and implementation .",
    "however , the polynomial degree of the potential approximation on a given element of the spatial mesh is not required to equal the degree , with respect to @xmath61 , of the polynomial approximation of the distribution @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the upg method of approximation to the vlasov - poisson system is defined by coupling together the ug method of approximation to the vlasov equation with interior penalty methods of approximation to the poisson equation .",
    "this nonlinear semi - discrete approximation results in a first - order nonlinear ode system , the solution of which determines the approximation @xmath9 of @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting ode system is readily solved using an explicit conservative time - integrator such as the runge - kutta method . moreover , in the process of computing @xmath9 , both the approximation @xmath68 of the electric field @xmath69 and the approximation @xmath70 of the potential @xmath59 are computed by one of the penalty methods for the elliptic equation .",
    "we assume the computational domain in velocity space is a bounded set @xmath71 and that the approximate solution to @xmath14 is assumed to vanish in @xmath72 .",
    "it is then , implicitly for our simulation , assumed that the velocity support of the approximation to the true solution @xmath6 of the vlasov - poisson system is contained in @xmath71 for all times .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for problems with spatial periodic boundary conditions , as it is expected that most of the density associated with the approximation to @xmath6 will be contained in a sufficiently large fixed set @xmath71 .",
    "the error due to this assumption only depends on the density of the true solution @xmath6 computed on the complement of @xmath71 in @xmath22 .",
    "further , the conservative nature of the transport equation with the space dependent divergence - free flow field @xmath73 , motivates us to choose the computational scheme as follows :    let @xmath74 be a sequence of successively refined meshes of the bounded domain @xmath21 and let @xmath75 be a sequence of successively refined meshes of the bounded domain @xmath76 , where @xmath77 given the meshes @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the elements @xmath80 and @xmath81 comprising each of the respective meshes are sets of the following types : intervals , if @xmath82 ; triangles or quadrilaterals , if @xmath83 ; and tetrahedra , prisms or hexahedra , if @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding spatial refinement level @xmath85 and velocity refinement level @xmath86 are defined by @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "a sequence of successively refined meshes @xmath89 of the , now , computational domain @xmath90 is generated by defining each mesh @xmath91 to be @xmath92 where the refinement level is @xmath93 .",
    "thus , for any given element @xmath94 there exists a unique pair of elements @xmath95 and @xmath95 such that @xmath96 , which is equivalent to the existence of an invertible mapping from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "the derivation of the following upg method requires the use of the broken sobolev space @xmath100 , @xmath101 , which is defined as follows : @xmath102 i.e. , @xmath100 is the space of those functions that have elementwise weak derivatives up to , and including , the order @xmath103 . then for nonnegative integers @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the discontinuous approximation space @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the space of polynomials on a set @xmath109 with degree less than or equal to @xmath110 in each variable .",
    "thus , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 denotes the space of polynomials satisfying that the sum of the degrees of all the variables is less than or equal to @xmath110 .    the choice of @xmath108 for basis functions is suitable for cartesian meshes in both @xmath61-space and @xmath113-space , respectively , where trace and inverse inequalities that are derived by mapping to the reference element in the approximating framework are possible , as first introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , one may use triangles in two - dimensions , and prisms or hexahedra in three - dimensions , for both @xmath61-space and @xmath113-space , for which the natural choice of polynomial space would be @xmath114 .",
    "we point out that these selections of approximating spaces is consistent with the divergence free , linear , and conservation form of the vlasov equation , and the fact that the choice of the mesh associated with the computational domain @xmath90 is a set of product mesh elements @xmath96 , for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "such is clearly preserved by the vlasov flow and the corresponding approximation results for @xmath112 will be valid",
    ". this choice may be preferable in higher dimensions since the number of degrees of freedom of the basis functions in @xmath112 is @xmath115 , while for @xmath108 is @xmath116 , for @xmath8-dimensional calculations .",
    "the discontinuous nature of the space @xmath100 needs the introduction of mesh faces .",
    "if @xmath117 is a boundary element , then @xmath118 is called a boundary mesh face .",
    "if @xmath119 and @xmath120 are two intersecting elements whose common intersection lies in the interior of @xmath42 , then @xmath121 is said to be an interior mesh face .",
