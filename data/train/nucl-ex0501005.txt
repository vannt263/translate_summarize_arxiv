    "this talk will focus on strangeness and heavy flavor and report recent results from phenix .",
    "the topics are the following : ( 1 ) event anisotropy of charged @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath5 = 62.4 gev au+au collisions comparing to 200 gev , ( 2 ) event anisotropy of heavy flavor electron in 200 gev au+au , ( 3 ) the invariant cross - section of @xmath0 meson production in 200 gev d+au and au+au , ( 4 ) exotic particle search in 200 gev @xmath3+@xmath3 , d+au and au+au , and ( 5 ) detector upgrade for future strangeness and heavy flavor measurement at phenix . a detailed report and discussion about heavy flavor results is presented in  @xcite .",
    "the phenix detector consists of two central arms and forward muon arms .",
    "the central arms have the capability of identifying and measuring charged hadrons ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , d , and @xmath8 ) , electrons and positrons , photons , and anti - neutrons . by using the invariant mass spectrum ,",
    "weak - decay particles and resonances can be identified , for example , @xmath9 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 .",
    "the forward muon arms identify @xmath13 .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector can be found in  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 @xmath3 , and @xmath4 @xmath14 in 200gev au+au collisions are shown in the right - hand side .",
    "the identified charged hadron @xmath16 is from @xcite and @xmath9 data has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the systematic errors related to particle identification and background are similar in both 62.4 gev and 200 gev .",
    "the difference comes from systematic uncertainties in the reaction plane determination due to different statistics and multiplicity in the bbc between 62.4 gev and 200 gev . ]",
    "event anisotropy analysis is a powerful tool to study properties of the early stage in high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal momentum distribution , @xmath14 , characterizes the event anisotropy .",
    "recent results of charged @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 @xmath14 are shown in in 62.4 gev and 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "both 62.4 gev and 200 gev results are from minimum bias trigger data ( about 40 m and 30 m events , respectively ) .",
    "the charged hadrons are identified by time - of - flight ( tof ) information with momentum .",
    "the neutral pion is reconstructed from photon pairs measured by the electro - magnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) .",
    "the @xmath14 is computed with respect to the reaction plane which is defined by hits in the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) located in the forward / backward regions ( north and south ) at @xmath17 = 3.1 - 3.9 . since the @xmath14 measured is smeared due to reaction plane resolution , it is necessary to correct for their effect .",
    "the correction factor is calculated from the two reaction planes defined by data from the north and south bbc separately , using a method described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 in @xmath5 = 62.4 gev au+au collisions shows the same order of magnitude and mass dependence as in 200 gev au+au . as we reported in @xcite , there is a crossover point among hadrons around @xmath18 = 2gev/@xmath19 in 200 gev au+au .",
    "the proton @xmath14 crosses the pion and kaon around @xmath18 = 2 gev/@xmath19 in 62.4 gev au+au , the same as in 200 gev .",
    "since the lower @xmath18 ( @xmath20 2 gev/@xmath19 ) region in 62.4 gev au+au shows similar mass dependence to 200 gev au+au , it might be well described by hydrodynamical models . in the @xmath18@xmath212 gev/@xmath19 , the meson @xmath14 remains different from that for baryons .",
    "this suggests a scaling rule from a quark coalescence model  @xcite , which relates to the different number of quarks in mesons and baryons .",
    "additionally , it might indicate that the hadron @xmath14 is generated during the early partonic stage before the hadronization .",
    "is a simple check of the coalescence picture in @xmath16 for normalizing both @xmath14 and @xmath15 by the number of constituent quarks . the data in 62.4 ( 200 )",
    "gev au+au collisions are shown by solid ( open ) markers in the figure .",
    "we make the following observations : ( 1 ) the 62.4 gev data seem to be described by the coalescence picture , ( 2 ) the 62.4 gev data are slightly smaller than 200 gev but consistent within the systematic uncertainty , and ( 3 ) observables ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) suggest a saturation of azimuthal anisotropy in au+au collisions in the range from 62.4 to 200 gev .",
    "more statistics in 62.4 gev au+au is needed to conclude whether the particle type dependence of @xmath16 as a function @xmath18 and centrality are the same as in 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "( color online ) @xmath14 as a function of @xmath15 scaled via the coalescence prescription .",
    "the solid ( open ) markers show the data from @xmath5 = 62.4 ( 200 ) gev au+au . ]",
    "phenix has measured inclusive electrons ( and positrons ) .",
    "the data include two components , which are ` photonic ' and ` non - photonic ' electrons .",
    "the ` photonic ' electrons mainly come from dalitz decay ( of @xmath9 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 , and etc . ) , di - electron decays ( of @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 , and etc . ) , photon conversions , and kaon ( @xmath25 ) decays .",
    "the ` non - photonic ' electrons are estimated by subtracting ` photonic ' electrons from inclusive electrons . ( a detailed discussion of the electron measurement is found in reference  @xcite . )",
    "although the non - photonic electrons are decay products from both charmed and bottom mesons , event anisotropy for the @xmath15 range from the run-2 data set are dominantly charmed meson decays .    the ` non - photonic ' electron @xmath16 in 200 gev au+au collisions from run-2",
    "is shown in with statistical error ( vertical bar ) and systematic errors ( shaded box ) .",
    "the two lines in address two scenarios from a model calculation in  @xcite .",
    "the solid line shows one scenario in which @xmath26 mesons are made from completely thermalized charm and light quarks ; the other ( dashed line ) is that there is no interaction of the @xmath19-quarks , so that the flow contribution in @xmath26 s is only from the light quarks . within the available statistics , both models are consistent with data .",
    "it will be very interesting to pursue this comparison of charm flow with that of mesons containing light quarks using the higher statistics run-4 data set .",
    "additionally , the systematic error of the ` non - photonic ' electron @xmath16 is expected to be relatively smaller for the run-4 data analysis , because uncertainty of the cross - section and @xmath16 for ` photonic ' electrons will be reduced .",
