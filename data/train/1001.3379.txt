    "rotational and vibrational excitation of small polyatomic ions by electron impact is one of the important processes occurring in a neutral molecular plasma . in particular",
    ", the probability of rovibrational ( de-)excitation in electron - ion collisions can be relatively high .",
    "the high probabilities and correspondingly high rate constants are driven by the non - born - oppenheimer coupling between electronic and rovibrational motions of the ion - electron system . in certain small polyatomic molecules ,",
    "the coupling is particularly strong , as is the case for the h@xmath1 ion .",
    "owing to its importance in interstellar space @xcite , planetary ionospheres @xcite and laboratory experiments @xcite , the h@xmath1 ion has been studied for many years . in particular , processes involving electron scattering from the ion have been recently studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "such processes include electron - impact rovibrational excitation @xcite , dissociative recombination @xcite , electronic excitation and ionisation @xcite and photoionization @xcite of the metastable neutral h@xmath5 molecule .",
    "astrophysically , electron impact excitation of molecular ions has been observed to be the dominant collisional excitation process in some environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previously , cross sections and rate constants for a few rotational transitions in h@xmath1 have been calculated @xcite .",
    "vibrational rate constants have apparently not been studied extensively for this fundamental ion . here , we present thermal rate constants for transitions between different rotational states of the ground vibrational level of h@xmath1 with low angular momentum , @xmath6 .",
    "we also present thermal rate constants for rotationally - averaged transitions between different vibrational levels .",
    "the next section of the article briefly discusses the theoretical approach used in the present calculation .",
    "a detailed description of the approach is lengthy and has already been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "therefore we only sketch here the main ideas of the approach . in section [ sec : vib_exc ] , we present the rates for vibrational ( de-)excitation of h@xmath1 . section [ sec : rot_exc ] is devoted to the calculation of rotational rate constants for transitions within rotational manifold of the ground vibrational level .",
    "astrophysical implications are discussed in section  [ sec : astro ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : concl ] presents our conclusions .",
    "the theoretical model employed in the present study is based on quantum defect theory .",
    "it is discussed in detail by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . here , we only mention the main ideas used in the model .    the energy - dependent theoretical rate constant @xmath7 for a transition from the initial rovibrational level @xmath8 to a final one @xmath9 is obtained from the corresponding matrix element @xmath10 of the energy - dependent scattering operator , @xmath11 .",
    "the main difficulty in the theoretical approach is the construction of the scattering matrix @xmath10 , ( the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 refer to specific rovibrational states of the h@xmath1 ion ; the electron angular momentum and its coupling with the ion to form a total angular momentum eigenstate are implied as well , but these will be suppressed in our notation since they are diagonal quantum numbers in the present approximation ) . for our discussion , it is convenient to represent the index @xmath8 as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 specifies the rotational quantum numbers , i.e. ionic angular momentum @xmath3 and its projection @xmath14 on the molecular axis ; and @xmath15 specifies the vibrational quantum numbers in a normal mode classification .",
    "we note that our model neglects the explicit coupling between rotational and vibrational angular momenta which occurs for excited vibrational states with @xmath16 and which leads to a more complicated set of quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "the construction of the scattering matrix @xmath10 begins from the _ ab initio _",
    "potential surfaces of the ground electronic state of the ion and several excited states of the neutral h@xmath5 molecule @xcite , ( @xmath17 for the ion and @xmath18 for the neutral molecule ) .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath19 to specify collectively the three internuclear distances . for a given geometry @xmath19",
    ", the electronic wave function of the outer electron of the h@xmath5 excited states resembles the electronic wave function of the hydrogen atom .",
    "however , due to fact that at short distances from the ionic core the electron - ion interaction is different from that in the hydrogen atom , the electron binding energy @xmath20 is generally different than the corresponding binding energy @xmath21 in the hydrogen atom ( @xmath22 is the principal quantum number ) .",
    "the departure of the @xmath23 difference from @xmath21 is written as @xmath24 , where the quantum defect @xmath25 is only weakly dependent on the principal quantum number @xmath22 .",
    "when the energy @xmath26 of the electron+ion system approaches the ionization limit ( @xmath27 ) and becomes larger , the principal quantum number @xmath22 looses its physical meaning , but the quantum defect @xmath25 does not : it gives the collisional phase shift @xmath28 in terms of the scattering phase in electron - ion collisions at energies above the ionization limit @xcite .",
    "the phase shift also depends weakly on the energy @xmath26 and it determines the scattering matrix @xmath29 .",
    "this is the reason why the energies of excited electronic states in the neutral molecule can be used to obtain the quantum defect and to describe collisions between the ion and the electron .",
    "the preceding discussion assumes that the electron scatters from ( or is bound to ) the molecular ion , which stays at a given geometry , i.e. the nuclei remain fixed throughout .",
    "this approximation is only reliable on a time scale much shorter than the period of ionic vibrational motion . in this limit ,",
    "the quantum defects are functions of geometry @xmath19 , @xmath30 . generally speaking ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath30 is much smoother than the dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath31 .",
    "although the quantum defect depends only weakly on the principal quantum number @xmath22 , it usually depends strongly on the angular momentum @xmath32 and on its projection @xmath33 on the molecular axis of the ionic core . for a nonlinear triatomic ion such as h@xmath1",
    ", the body - frame quantization axis is chosen as the normal to the plane containing the nuclei . at large @xmath34 , the quantum defects become small , because the electronic wave function of high @xmath32 approaches the unperturbed wave function in the hydrogen atom .    therefore , for the description of an electron - ion scattering process involving low values of @xmath32 , one must obtain the quantum defect functions @xmath35 for various @xmath32 and @xmath33 and the corresponding scattering matrices @xmath36 .",
    "the calculated potential energy surfaces are obtained in the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite , i.e. in which the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion is neglected . the quantum defects and the scattering matrices obtained from the potential surfaces as described above , therefore ,",
    "fail to account for the coupling .",
    "however , in the h@xmath37 case a strong non - adiabatic jahn - teller interaction must be accounted for in order to appropriately describe the scattering process .",
    "it mixes the two @xmath38 electronic states of the same orbital angular momentum @xmath32 of the incoming electron and can be included in the scattering matrix built from quantum defects using the formalism suggested in @xcite .",
    "the resulting scattering matrix is now not diagonal over the @xmath33 quantum numbers .",
    "the strongest coupling is between the @xmath39 electronic states . in our treatment",
    "we include only @xmath40-states ( @xmath38 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "this implies that this body - frame scattering matrix @xmath42 is a @xmath43 matrix @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix constructed in this way represents the electron - ion scattering only if the ion stays at the same configuration @xmath44 during the entire process , which is not a valid description .",
    "the physically meaningful scattering matrix must describe the amplitude of scattering from a particular rovibrational state of the ion to another one , including the possibility of nuclear motion during the full collision process .",
    "we denote this as the space - fixed scattering matrix @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 refer to initial and final states of the ion .",
    "the formalism of the rovibrational frame transformation @xcite allows us to use the matrix @xmath48 to construct the @xmath45 matrix . in this formalism , the two matrices are considered as two equivalent forms of the same scattering operator in two different representation bases .",
    "the representation basis of @xmath49 is the set of rovibrational energy eigenstates @xmath50 .",
    "the basis for the @xmath51 matrix is made of tensor products @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents the vibrational position eigenstates of the ion , @xmath54 is the angular state vector of the electron in either the @xmath39 or @xmath55 state .",
    "the two representations are connected by the standard basis transformation formula @xmath56 where the summation indicates a sum over discrete indices and an integration over the continuous coordinates @xmath19 and rotational coordinates ( three euler angles ) . because the scattering matrix in the @xmath57 basis is diagonal over @xmath53 , it is convenient to write @xmath58 as @xmath59 , the notation that has been already used in the above discussion .",
    "the explicit form of the matrix elements @xmath60 for the unitary transformation is given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 matrix is diagonal with respect to the rotational quantum numbers @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the whole molecule and the continuous coordinate @xmath19 . @xmath64 and @xmath63 are the angular momentum of the neutral molecule , and the two projections of the angular momentum on the molecular symmetry axis and on the space - fixed @xmath65-axis , respectively . to completely define the bf basis functions @xmath57 , in addition to @xmath33 and @xmath19 , the rotational quantum numbers @xmath62 and @xmath66 must be also specified ; for brevity they are omitted in the above equation although their presence is implied .    to specify the vibrational states in the sf representation",
    ", we will use the normal mode approximation , i.e. specifying ionic vibrational eigenstates by the quantum numbers \\{@xmath67}. the rotational part of the total wave function is specified by rotational quantum numbers @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the angular momentum of the ion , and the two projections of the angular momentum on the molecular symmetry axis and on the space - fixed @xmath65-axis , @xmath71 is the projection of electronic angular momentum @xmath32 on the space - fixed @xmath65-axis . in the following , we will not specify any other conserved quantum numbers that are the same in both bases , such as the total nuclear spin and the irreducible representation of the total wavefunction .    the matrix @xmath72 obtained by the above procedure does not yet represent the physical scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "in fact , it represents the actual scattering matrix @xmath73 only for energies high enough such that _ all _ of the channels @xmath50 are open for electron escape , i.e. where the total energy of the system is higher than the energy of the highest relevant ionization channel @xmath50 .",
    "when at least one channel is closed , the physical scattering matrix @xmath73 is obtained from @xmath74 using the standard mqdt channel - elimination formula ( see eq .",

    "it has been assumed that the initial @xmath50 and final @xmath77 states are different .",
    "if one is not interested in the rotational structure of initial and final vibrational states , the final cross - section ( or thermal rate constant ) has to be averaged over the initial rotational levels and summed up over the final rotational levels .",
    "this can be done using the full rovibrational frame transformation technique described above . however , the cross - section averaged over initial rotational levels and summed up over the final rotational levels is very similar to the one obtained neglecting the rotational structure of the ion .",
    "the cross - section obtained accounting for the rotational structure has more resonances due to interaction between rotational states but the averaged value is close to the value obtained without the rotational structure .",
    "the quantity of interest in astrophysical applications is the thermally - averaged rate constant . because the thermally - averaged rate is not sensitive to the position of individual resonances in the energy - dependent cross - section , the calculations with and without the rotational structure",
    "give the same result .",

    "only transitions from the ground vibrational level @xmath78 are shown .",
    "the @xmath79 probabilities oscillate a lot below 3000 @xmath80 and become less energy - dependent above .",
    "the oscillations are due to the strong rotational coupling between individual rotational levels of the initial and final states of the ion .",
