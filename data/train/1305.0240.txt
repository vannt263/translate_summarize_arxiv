    "crystals of the perovskite family are well - known materials undergoing various structural distortions with decreasing temperature .",
    "when the character of these distortions is ferroelectric , a number of physical properties of these crystals ( dielectric constant , piezoelectric coefficients , etc . )",
    "becomes anomalously large . for this reason",
    ", these materials have found wide application in modern electronics .",
    "the problem of further optimization of the ferroelectric properties requires a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the appearance of ferroelectricity and the ferroelectric properties . in solving this problem",
    ", very useful information can be obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculations which have already made a significant contribution to the understanding of the ferroelectric phenomena in the perovskite crystals .",
    "@xcite    in discussing the properties of ferroelectrics , it is very important to understand whether these properties result from a collective displacement of atoms in a lattice ( displacive phase transition ) or they are due to specific features of certain constituent atoms in a crystal ( order  disorder phase transition ) .",
    "this problem arises , in particular , in discussing the nature of the phase transitions that occur in incipient ferroelectrics doped with certain impurities .",
    "@xcite    earlier studies of titanates with the perovskite structure have dealt mainly with four compounds ( catio@xmath0 ,  @xcite srtio@xmath0 ,  @xcite batio@xmath0 ,  @xcite and pbtio@xmath0  @xcite ) and their solid solutions . however",
    ", a comparison of the results obtained in these studies is hampered by different calculation techniques used in these investigations and different methods used to construct atomic ( pseudo)potentials .",

    "we draw conclusions about the origin of the ferroelectricity in these materials and find conditions under which the ferroelectric phenomena can be associated with off - center atoms .",
    "the calculations were performed using the abinit software  @xcite based on the density functional theory , pseudopotentials , and the plane - wave expansion of the wave functions .",
    "the exchange - correlation interaction was described in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "@xcite the used pseudopotentials were optimized separable nonlocal pseudopotentials ,  @xcite which were constructed using the opium code and to which the local potential correction  @xcite was added in order to improve their transferability . for elements with atomic numbers @xmath1 ,",
    "the construction was performed in a non - relativistic way ; for other elements , a scalar - relativistic approximation was used .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists the parameters used for constructing pseudopotentials .",
    "the local potential was the @xmath2 potential except for the oxygen atom , for which the local @xmath3 potential was used .",
    "the parameters of pseudopotentials were finely adjusted by comparing the calculated and experimental values of the lattice parameters for a number of oxides and sulfides of the elements .",
    "the lattice parameters and the equilibrium atomic positions in the unit cell were obtained by minimizing the hellmann ",
    "feynman forces acting on the atoms ( @xmath410@xmath5 ha / bohr ) , with the total energy being calculated self - consistently with an accuracy of better than 10@xmath6  ha . and [ table3 ] . ] in the calculations , particular attention was paid to the convergence of the results with respect to the kinetic energy cut - off for plane waves and the density of the @xmath7-point mesh used in the integration over the brillouin zone . for all the calculated properties presented below , the convergence was attained at an energy cut - off of 30  ha and the 8@xmath88@xmath88 @xmath7-point mesh constructed according to ref .  .",
    "the born effective charges @xmath9 , optical dielectric constant @xmath10 , elastic moduli @xmath11 , bulk modulus @xmath12 , force - constant matrix @xmath13 , and phonon spectra were calculated using the density - functional perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite the phonon frequencies were calculated exactly at five points of the brillouin zone ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the @xmath18 point located halfway between the @xmath14 and @xmath17 points ) , and then the phonon spectrum was computed over the entire brillouin zone using the interpolation technique .",
    "@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the diagonal elements of the on - site force - constant matrix @xmath19 for @xmath20 and ti atoms are presented in table  [ table9 ] .",
    "these matrices are defined in terms of the restoring force acting on an atom displaced from its site , with the other atoms fixed at their lattice sites . to determine the on - site force constants from the force constants calculated using the abinit software for a sublattice displaced as a whole , the force constants calculated on a regular mesh of wave vectors were averaged .",
    "@xcite positive values of the on - site force constants indicate that the position of an atom at its site is stable , while the negative values indicate that the atom is off - center .",
    "as follows from table  [ table9 ] , the off - centering of the @xmath20 atoms should be observed in _ _ a__tio@xmath0 perovskites for _ a _ = mg , zn , cd , and ge . the sn , ca , and pb atoms are fairly close to the stability limit against the transition to an off - center position .",
    "it should be recalled that in this work , the calculations were performed for the theoretical lattice parameter ( corresponding to a minimum of the total energy ) . as the systematically underestimated lattice parameters in the lda",
    "weakens the ferroelectric instability , many authors perform calculations for the experimental lattice parameters . in order to estimate the influence of this systematic error , we carried out a computer simulation which showed that an increase in the lattice parameter by 1% ( which is a typical lda error ) decreases @xmath19 in pbtio@xmath0 by 0.006  ha / bohr@xmath21 for the @xmath20 atom and by 0.016  ha / bohr@xmath21 for the ti atom . as a result",
    ", the atoms with @xmath19 close to the stability limit against the transition to an off - center position can actually be off - center .",
    "perhaps , this occurs in lead titanate , as indicated by extended x - ray - absorption fine - structure ( exafs ) studies .",
    "@xcite    dependence of the @xmath22 matrix element for the _ a _ atom on its ionic radius . ]",
    "the main parameter determining the tendency of the @xmath20 atom in _ _ a__tio@xmath0 compounds to become off - center is its atomic size .",
    "however , if one plots the dependence of @xmath19 on the ionic radius of the _ a _ atom ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , it becomes clear that the curve for zn and cd atoms , as well as the curve for ge , sn , and pb atoms , are different from that for the `` main '' mg ",
    "ca  sr  ba ",
    "ra series .",
    "this difference is likely a consequence of different configuration of the outer electron shell for the atoms .",
    "this configuration is @xmath23 for zn and cd ; @xmath24 for ge , sn , and pb ; and @xmath25 for the atoms of the main series .",
    "the difference in the properties of these groups of atoms is clearly manifested in the born effective charges of the @xmath20 atoms ( table  [ table6 ] ) .",
    "indeed , for the main series , the effective charge @xmath26 differs only slightly from the nominal charge of the cation ( which indicates the predominantly ionic character of the @xmath20o bond ) ; for the other two groups , the charge @xmath26 is significantly larger , which indicates that the bonding becomes more covalent in character .",
    "@xcite    the obtained results suggest that off - center impurity atoms can exist in solid solutions of titanates with the perovskite structure . since the average interatomic distance in these crystals",
    "is determined by the matrix , one can expect that the atoms for which @xmath19 has negative or small positive values can be off - center .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the ferroelectric phase transition induced by ca , cd , and pb impurities in srtio@xmath0  ( ref .  ) is due to off - centering of these atoms . according to the exafs data , the ba atoms in srtio@xmath0 are on - center ,  @xcite but the pb atoms in srtio@xmath0 and batio@xmath0 can be off - center .",
    "@xcite    the results of this study differ somewhat from those obtained by kvyatkovskii ,  @xcite according to which the multiwell adiabatic potential occurred only for mg and zn atoms , whereas cd atoms remained in the on - site positions .",
    "the discrepancy between our results is likely due to the fact that in ref .",
    "the calculations were performed for relatively small clusters in which the extended correlation of atomic motion can not be correctly taken into account ( according to refs .   and , the correlation length can be as large as 20   ) .",
    "the pseudopotentials constructed in this work have been used to calculate the phonon spectra of _",
    "_ a__tio@xmath0 perovskite crystals within the density functional theory .",
    "all known results on the structural instability in these compounds were reproduced and the properties of new , previously unknown systems were predicted . the analysis of the phonon spectra , the force constant matrix , and the eigenvectors of unstable to phonons enabled to establish the relative contributions of the chain instability and off - centering of atoms to the appearance of ferroelectricity in these compounds",
    ". the main factors determining the possible off - centering of the @xmath20 atoms are the geometric size of these atoms and the configuration of their outer electron shell .",
