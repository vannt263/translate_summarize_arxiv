    "recently the spin hall effect ( she )  @xcite has attracted much attention due to its potential application in spintronics . in the spin hall effect , a longitudinal electric field creates a transverse motion of spins with the spin - up and spin - down carriers moving in opposite directions , which leads to a transverse spin current perpendicular to the external electric field . to understand the spin hall effect",
    ", one needs to study the intrinsic spin hall effect ( ishe ) that has been discussed intensively .",
    "theoretically ishe may exist in the p - type semiconductor  @xcite and two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )  @xcite .",
    "sinova et al .",
    "@xcite predicted a universal spin hall conductivity in clean 2deg as @xmath5 from then on , many researchers have devoted to the issue of whether this result can be modified in the presence of impurity .",
    "some authors found that an arbitrarily small concentration of impurities would suppress the spin hall conductivity to zero due to the vertex corrections  @xcite . while others  @xcite argued that the spin hall conductivity was robust in the presence of disorder , falling to zero only when the lifetime broadening is larger than the spin orbit splitting of the bands , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "grimaldi  @xcite considered the situation of sufficiently low electron density , and found that the vertex corrections no longer suppressed the spin hall conductivity when the fermi energy is comparable to or smaller than the spin - orbit energy .",
    "other authors revealed that the vanishing of @xmath7 was a peculiar feature of the linear rashba model .",
    "taking into account of nonlinear momentum dependence of the spin - orbit interaction @xmath8  @xcite or a nonquadratic band spectrum @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath7 was robust against impurity scattering .",
    "very recently , an important step was made by inoue et al .",
    "@xcite who found the spin hall conductivity was not zero in the existence of magnetic impurities in the limit of @xmath10 .",
    "physically , the acceleration of the electrons by the external electric field modifies the so - induced pseudomagnetic field such that the spins are tilted out of the 2deg plane in directions that are opposite for positive and negative lateral momentum states .",
    "this corresponds to a flow of @xmath11 and @xmath12 spins in opposite directions without a corresponding net charge transport . in the presence of isotropic impurity scattering , the spin hall current is proportional to the time derivative of the spin polarization  @xcite which vanishes in a stationary state . whereas , this relation does not fulfil for magnetic impurities , leaving over an opportunity for nonvanishing spin hall conductivity . as we are aware , the case considered by inoue has not been developed to anisotropic model in the semiclassical limit @xmath0 . and",
    "inoue et al . adopted a simplified approximation in calculating the integral of green s functions .",
    "it is therefore obliged to study such kind models and investigate spin hall conductivity carefully .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the spin hall conductivity for a two - dimensional magnetically disordered rashba - electron gas where the magnetic interaction is anisotropic in the limit of large fermi circle @xmath13 .",
    "the xxz - type interaction between the magnetic impurity and the electron spin is adopted .",
    "our calculation is carried out by considering the vertex corrections with the help of kubo s linear response formalism within the self - consistent born approximation .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] , we give a comparison between our result and the result in other disordered system and discuss the possible reasons that cause the vanishing spin hall conductivity .",
    "we consider the 2deg with rashba spin - orbit coupling in the presence of impurities , whose hamiltonian consists of two parts @xmath14 with @xmath15 the sum of the kinetic and rashba terms , and @xmath16 the potential caused by impurities .",
    "the main contribution of a short - ranged magnetic impurity can be described by an interaction between an itinerant electron and a local magnetic moment  @xcite whose orientation is defined by polar and azimuthal angles @xmath17 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spin ] ) .",
    "a quite general form of such kind interaction is of xxz type whose second quantization form is given by the following hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote the position and orientation of the @xmath20th impurity , @xmath21 the total number of impurities ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to , respectively , the strength and the anisotropy of the coupling between the itinerant electrons and the impurities . @xmath24 the interaction becomes isotropic for the special value @xmath25 which corresponds to the model considered by inoue @xcite .",
