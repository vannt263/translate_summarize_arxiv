    "we are going to construct a combined effective model reproducing the equation of state of hadronic matter as obtained in recent lattice qcd simulations @xcite . the model should reproduce basic physical characteristics of processes encountered in the dense hadronic matter , from the hot qcd phase through the critical temperature region till the lower temperature hadron resonance gas phase .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the equation of state derived from that time qcd lattice calculation @xcite can be reproduced by a simple hadron gas resonance model below critical temperature @xmath0 . for higher temperatures the model",
    "is modified by introducing finite widths of heavy hadrons @xcite with a heuristic ansatz for the spectral function which reflects medium modifications of hadrons .",
    "this mott - hagedorn type model is constructed to fit nicely the lattice data , also above @xmath0 where it does so because it leaves light hadrons below a mass threshold of @xmath1 gev unaffected .",
    "the description of the lattice data at high temperatures is accidental because the effective number of those degrees of freedom approximately coincides with that of quarks and gluons . in order to remove this unphysical aspect of the otherwise appealing model one has to extend the spectral broadening also to the light hadrons and",
    "thus describe their disappearance due to the mott effect while simultaneously the quark and gluon degrees of freedom appear at high temperatures due to chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement . in the present contribution we will report first results obtained by introducing a unified treatment of all hadronic resonances with a state - dependent width @xmath2 in accordance with the inverse hadronic collision time scale from a recent model for chemical freeze - out in a resonance gas @xcite .",
    "the appearance of quark and gluon degrees of freedom is introduced by the polyakov - loop improved nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite .",
    "the model is further refined by adding perturbative corrections to @xmath3 for the high - momentum region above the three - momentum cutoff inherent in the pnjl model .",
    "one obtains eventually a good agreement with lattice qcd data , comparable with all important physical characteristics taken into account .",
    "we introduce the width @xmath4 of a resonance in the statistical model through the spectral function @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the standard normalization factor .",
    "the model ansatz for the resonance width @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 mev .",
    "for simplicity , we assume @xmath12 for the strangeness number density and @xmath13 for the baryon number density . then the respective chemical potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 always , so that the temperature is the only significant statistical parameter here .",
    "the energy density of this model can then be cast in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 gev and the energy density per degree of freedom with a mass @xmath18 is @xmath19 with the degeneracy @xmath20 . for mesons , @xmath21 and for baryons @xmath22 . for our hadronic gas kept at fixed volume",

    "although providing us with an excellent fit of the lattice data , the high - temperature phase of this model is unphysical .",
    "imposing that all mesons lighter than @xmath1 gev are stable provides us with a sb limit at high temperatures which mimicks that due to quarks and gluons in the case for three flavors @xcite . in reality , due to the chiral phase transition at @xmath0 , the quarks loose their mass and therefore the threshold of the continuum of quark - antiquark scattering states is lowered .",
    "the light meson masses , however , remain almost unaffected by the increase in the temperature of the system .",
    "consequently , they merge the continuum and become unbound - their spectral function changes from a delta - function ( on - shell bound states ) to a breit - wigner - type ( off - shell , resonant scattering states ) .",
    "this phenomenon is the hadronic analogue @xcite of the mott - anderson transition for electrons in solid state physics ( insulator - conductor transition ) .",
    "it has been first introduced for the hadronic - to - quark - matter transition in @xcite .",
    "later , within the njl model , a microscopic approach to the thermodynamics of the mott dissociation of mesons in quark matter has been given in the form of a generalized beth - uhlenbeck equation of state @xcite , see also @xcite .    as a microscopic treatment of the mott effect for all resonances is presently out of reach",
    ", we introduce an ansatz for a state - dependent hadron resonance width @xmath2 given by the inverse collision time scale recently suggested within an approach to the chemical freeze - out and chiral condensate in a resonance gas @xcite @xmath29 which is based on a binary collision approximation and relaxation time ansatz using for the in - medium hadron - hadron cross sections the geometrical povh - hfner law @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) the coefficient @xmath30 is a free parameter , @xmath31 is the partial density of the hadron @xmath32 and the mean squared radii of hadrons @xmath33 obtain in the medium a temperature dependence which is governed by the ( partial ) restoration of chiral symmetry . for the pion",
    "this was quantitatively studied within the njl model @xcite and it was shown that close to the mott transition the pion radius is well approximated by @xmath34 and a pion cloud contribution @xmath35 where from the vacuum values @xmath36 fm and @xmath37 fm one gets @xmath38 fm .",
    "a key point of our approach is that the temperature dependent hadronic radii shall diverge when hadron dissociation ( mott effect ) sets in , driven basically by the restoration of chiral symmetry . as a consequence , in the vicinity of the chiral restoration temperature all meson radii shall behave like that of the pion and all baryon radii like that of the nucleon .",
    "the resulting energy density and pressure behavior is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "this part of the model we call mott - hagedorn - resonance - gas ( mhrg ) .",
    "when all hadrons are gone at @xmath39 mev , we are clearly missing degrees of freedom !",
    "we improve the pnjl model over its standard versions @xcite by adding perturbative corrections in @xmath3 for the high - momentum region above the three - momentum cutoff @xmath40 . in the second step ,",
    "the mhrg part is replaced by its final form , using the state - dependent spectral function for the description of the mott dissociation of all hadron resonances above the chiral transition .",
    "the total pressure obtains the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the pressure of the mhrg model , accounting for the dissociation of hadrons in hot dense , matter .",
    "the @xmath3 corrections can be split in quark and gluon contributions @xmath43 where @xmath44 stands for the quark contribution and @xmath45 contains the ghost and gluon contributions .",
    "the total perturbative qcd correction to @xmath3 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding contribution to the energy density is given in standard way by eq .",
    "( [ six ] ) .",
    "we will now include an effective description of the dissociation of hadrons due to the mott effect into the hadron resonance gas model by including the state dependent hadron resonance width ( [ gamma ] ) into the definition of the hrg pressure @xmath48 from the pressure as a thermodynamic potential all relevant thermodynamical functions can be obtained . combining the @xmath28 corrected meanfield pnjl model for the quark - gluon subsystem with the mhrg description of the hadronic resonances we obtain the results shown in the right panel of fig .  [ fig.1 ] where the resulting partial contributions in comparison with lattice qcd data from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown .",
    "we see that the lattice qcd thermodynamics is in full accordance with a hadron resonance gas up to a temperature of @xmath49 mev which corresponds to the pseudocritical temperature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "the lattice data saturate below the stefan - boltzmann limit of an ideal quark - gluon gas at high temperatures .",
    "the pnjl model , however , attains this limit by construction .",
    "the deviation is to good accuracy described by perturbative corrections to @xmath3 which vanish at low temperatures due to an infrared cutoff procedure .",
    "the transition region @xmath50\\le 250 $ ] is described by the mhrg model , resulting in a decreasing hrg pressure which vanishes at @xmath51 mev .",
    "we have presented two stages of an effective model description of qcd thermodynamics at finite temperatures which properly accounts for the fact that in the qcd transition region it is dominated by a tower of hadronic resonances . to this end",
    "we have further developed a generalization of the hagedorn resonance gas thermodynamics which includes the finite lifetime of hadronic resonances in a hot and dense medium by a model ansatz for a temperature- and mass dependent spectral function .",
