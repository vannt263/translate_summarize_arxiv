    "enumeration of polyominoes is a well - established topic in mathematics , physics and chemistry @xcite . it would be ideal to know how many polyominoes can be made up of @xmath0 cells , or how many borders of polyominoes can be made up of @xmath3 unit edges . realistically speaking , however ,",
    "neither of these questions will be answered in the foreseeable future .",
    "so it is a sound idea to confine attention to sets of polyominoes which do not contain all polyominoes , but anyway contain rather many of them .",
    "sets of that kind sometimes allow of the enumeration by perimeter and/or by area . yet , in defining such a  friendly \" set of polyominoes , there is not much room left for poetic license .",
    "that kind of definitions almost always require that the elements of the set be either in a certain sense _ convex _ or in a certain sense _ directed_. a classical example are _ column - convex polyominoes _ : their definition requires that the intersection between the polyomino and any vertical straight line must be a connected set .",
    "the area generating function for column - convex polyominoes has been known at least since 1956 @xcite .",
    "the perimeter generating function for column - convex polyominoes is also not a recent result @xcite .",
    "however , there exists an ongoing line of research aimed at constructing models which are supersets of column - convex polyominoes and are still solvable .",
    "the models constructed so far are called @xmath3__-convex polygons _ _",
    "@xcite , _ prudent polygons _",
    "@xcite , _ cheesy polyominoes _",
    "@xcite , and _ column - subconvex _ the former two models allow of the enumeration by perimeter , whereas the latter three models admit of the enumeration by area .",
    "( thus , it is still an open problem to think out a model which significantly generalizes column - convex polyominoes and admits of both the enumeration by perimeter and the enumeration by area . )",
    "column - duplex polyomino _ be a polyomino whose columns can have either one or two connected components .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , column - duplex polyominoes are already too hard a model : they seem to admit of no exact enumeration .",
    "this paper is concerned with a model which we have called _ simplex - duplex polyominoes_. a cheesy polyomino , a polyomino with cheesy blocks , a column - subconvex polyomino and a simplex - duplex polyomino are all column - duplex polyominoes . in the first three models , the definition requires ( perhaps among other things ) that the gap within a two - component column must not be greater than @xmath3 cells in size , where @xmath3 is a positive integer which we fix in advance . in the fourth model ( simplex - duplex polyominoes ) ,",
    "the gap within a column can be of any size , but it is not allowed that two two - component columns come one immediately after the other .",
    "the main result of this paper is a formula for a bivariate generating function @xmath4 , in which the coefficient of @xmath5 is the number of simplex - duplex polyominoes having @xmath0 cells and @xmath6 two - component columns . to compute the formula for @xmath4 , we make use of an upgraded version of the temperley method @xcite .",
    "our computations have some interesting features , as is described in the abstract above .",
    "although @xmath4 and @xmath7 prove to be very complicated @xmath8-series , from the formulas for @xmath4 and @xmath7 it is easy to find taylor polynomials of any reasonable degree .",
    "thus we get plenty of evidence that the number of @xmath0-celled simplex - duplex polyominoes behaves asymptotically as @xmath1 .",
    "this means that simplex - duplex polyominoes are one of the largest sets of polyominoes for which the area generating function is known ( cf .",
    "we already enumerated some fairly large sets of polyominoes @xcite , but those polyominoes had hexagonal cells , whereas simplex - duplex polyominoes have square cells .",
    "however , it is fair to say that the best currently known lower bound on klarner s constant is @xmath9 @xcite , which is a significantly greater number than our growth constant @xmath10 .",
    "this paper continues as follows . in section 2 , we state the necessary definitions and conventions . in section 3 ,",
    "we establish and solve a functional equation .",
    "the function satisfying that equation is a generating function not for all simplex - duplex polyominoes , but only for those simplex - duplex polyominoes which end with a one - component column .",
    "once the functional equation is solved , it is however very easy to obtain the area and duplex columns generating function for all simplex - duplex polyominoes .",
    "the formula for this latter generating function is stated in section 4 . in the same section ,",
    "there is also a corollary , in which we state the area generating function for column - convex polyominoes . in section 5",
    ", there is a bit of asymptotic analysis . in section 6",
    "we conclude , outlining further work prompted by our results .",

    "<S> back in the early days of polyomino enumeration , a model called column - convex polyominoes was introduced and its area generating function was found . that generating function is rational : the numerator has degree four and the denominator has degree three . </S>",
    "<S> let a column - duplex polyomino be a polyomino whose columns can have either one or two connected components . </S>",
    "<S> in spite of being an immediate generalization of column - convex polyominoes , column - duplex polyominoes do not seem amenable to any kind of exact enumeration . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we are interested in models which interpolate between column - convex polyominoes and column - duplex polyominoes . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is concerned with a model which we have called simplex - duplex polyominoes . a simplex - duplex polyomino is a column - duplex polyomino in which there is no occurrence of two adjacent columns each having two connected components . </S>",
    "<S> simplex - duplex polyominoes are not easy to deal with , but their area generating fuction can still be found . </S>",
    "<S> to find this generating function , we use an upgraded version of the temperley method . </S>",
    "<S> though that technique is widely used in these times , our application presents two interesting features . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we add one or two columns at a time , thus bypassing those simplex - duplex polyominoes which end with a two - component column . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is somewhat more usual to add just one column at a time . ) secondly , we obtain a functional equation that involves both the first and the second derivatives of the sought - for generating function . </S>",

    "<S> no derivative is involved at all . ) </S>",
    "<S> right because of this latter interesting feature , the temperley method produces a very complicated formula for the generating function . </S>",
    "<S> anyway , from that formula it is easy to compute taylor polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> thus we get plenty of evidence that the number of @xmath0-celled simplex - duplex polyominoes behaves asymptotically as @xmath1 . for comparison </S>",
