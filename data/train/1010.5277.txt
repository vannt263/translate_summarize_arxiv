    "infrared observations of radio galaxies are a useful tool to explore the physics of their nuclei in the framework of the unified models for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as in this band the impact of dust absorption is strongly reduced with respect to the optical . in particular , the study of the infrared nuclear sources allows us to investigate the ` scheme ' unifying different classes of agn , by exploring the properties of their accretion disks and the presence of any absorbing material that can account for the complex agn taxonomy .    in the `` zeroth - order approximation '' of the agn unification scheme for radio - loud sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , powerful radio galaxies with fr  ii edge - brightened morphology @xcite",
    "are believed to be misaligned quasars , while lower power , edge - darkened fr  is are associated with bl  lac objects .",
    "however , it is clear that this zeroth order approximation picture based on statistical comparison of the properties of radio - loud agn is over - simplified .",
    "inconsistencies between the characteristics of the `` parent '' and `` beamed ''",
    "populations are well reported in the literature : for example , several bl  lacs show broad emission lines ( e.g. @xcite ) ; and there are inconsistent environments ( e.g. @xcite ) and inconsistent radio morphologies ( e.g. @xcite ) ( see also @xcite and @xcite for reviews on this subject ) .",
    "furthermore , how the large - scale radio properties relate to different nuclear properties is still not clear .",
    "in fact , there is mixed evidence for a correlation between the morphological fr  i / fr  ii dichotomy and different levels of nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "another classification , based on the optical narrow emission lines ratios @xcite introduces two groups of radio - loud agn : the low excitation galaxies ( leg ) and high excitation galaxies ( heg ) .",
    "radio galaxies with fr  i radio morphology almost always belong to leg class , while nearly all hegs are fr  ii radio sources .",
    "however , there is a group of fr  ii legs whose place in the unifying scenario is still largely not understood . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that such objects constitute a single population of radio galaxies together with fr  is . in line with this idea ,",
    "the two spectroscopic classes , leg and heg , show significant differences in several properties : star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) , environment ( e.g. @xcite ) , triggering mechanism of nuclear activity ( gas - rich or gas - poor merger ) ( e.g. @xcite ) ; there are indications that they differ also in terms of accretion rate and radiative efficiency of disk ( e.g. @xcite ) ; contrarily to what is seen in heg , leg do not show evidence for large absorbing column densities in the x - ray spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) , for warm dusty tori in mid - ir images @xcite , and for broad lines in their optical spectra ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". taken together these differences suggest that high and low excitation galaxies belong to different classes of radio - loud nuclear activity which are associated with distinct environmental conditions .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that in the framework of the unification model , heg and leg might represent the parent population of qsos and bl  lacs respectively ( e.g. @xcite ) .    a number of recent papers in the literature address the topic of the infrared view of the active nucleus of radio galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that the infrared emission at both 24 and 70 micron can be explained in terms of dust heated predominantly by the agn .",
    "more comprehensive mid - ir and far - ir spectrophotometry for the z @xmath1 1 3cr objects has been obtained from iso ( @xcite ) as well as from spitzer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for high - redshift 3cr sources near infrared spectrophotometry using spitzer has been presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared observations are sensitive to thermal emission from warm dust and have revealed rather complex properties within the different radio - galaxy classifications .",
    "the majority of fris are faint at those wavelengths , implying that the bulk kinetic power of the radio jets is the energetically dominant mechanism in most of these sources @xcite . even in fr",
    "is this is not a universal conclusion as @xcite with iso data and @xcite with spitzer data show that in some fr  is a dust emission bump is detected . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that about 50% of the fr  ii narrow - line radio galaxies have mid - infrared photometric and spectroscopic properties comparable to quasars of matched radio luminosity , while there is a subsample of mid - ir weak fr  ii radio galaxies which may constitute a separate population of non - thermal , jet - dominated sources with low accretion power . @xcite present evidence that the mir data do in fact support the orientation - dependent unification scheme of the powerful fr  ii galaxies with quasars .",
    "this has been subsequently confirmed by further work , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this paper has the aim of investigating agn activity by focusing on the nuclear 1.6 @xmath0 m near infrared emission , identifying its physical origin and relating it to both the radio morphological and optical spectroscopic classes .",
    "@xcite studied the hst optical images of the nuclear regions of radio galaxies belonging to 3cr sample with the same purpose .",
    "the nir snapshot survey of 3cr objects with @xmath2 provided us with a larger coverage of the sample than that in the optical band .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of 3cr sources with spectroscopic classification is now substantially larger @xcite , allowing us to explore in greater detail the behavior of the nuclei of each class .",
    "the resolution of hst images is suitable for this purpose and allow us to distinguish the nir emission of stellar host galaxy background from the genuine agn radiation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .  2",
    "we describe the sample and in sect .",

    "we adopt a hubble constant of h@xmath3 = 75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath3 = 0.5 .",
    "we used this cosmology in order to be in accordance with the similar results obtained by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . assuming a different cosmology would not affect our results since the redshift of the sources considered in this paper is limited to @xmath5 .",
    "the sample of galaxies we analyzed belongs to the revised third cambridge catalog 3cr ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since it is selected based on the low - frequency radio flux ( s@xmath6 @xmath7 10 jy ) , the sample is essentially free from orientation bias .",
    "we chose all 116 3cr sources with z @xmath1 0.3 with the primary goal of characterizing the radio galaxy hosts mostly free from the effects of dust .",
    "one hundred objects were observed as part of hst / nicmos 3cr snapshot program go  10173 ( pi : sparks ) .",
    "the nir images are published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "only eleven galaxies were observed as a part of other programs and details of these are given in table  [ log ] .",

    "all of the objects of our sample were observed with hst nicmos camera 2 ( nic2 ) , which has a field of view of 19@xmath82 @xmath9 19@xmath82 and a projected pixel size of 0.075 , using the f160w filter ( similar to h band ) , which is centered at 1.60 @xmath0 m , covering a wavelength range from 1.4 to 1.8 @xmath0 m and which includes the pa@xmath10 line for objects with z @xmath7 0.1 . using the broad and narrow line h@xmath11 fluxes measured for 3cr galaxies @xcite over a 2@xmath12 aperture",
    ", we have estimate the contamination from line emission in the h band . in the case of the narrow lines we assumed ratio pa@xmath10/h@xmath11 = 0.06 from atomic physics @xcite .",
    "since the broad line galaxies are know not to conform to case b we have used the observed near infrared broad line region ratios observed in type 1 agn by @xcite and @xcite to estimate the contamination in the f160w filter .",
    "this analysis shows the contamination to be @xmath13 15% for broad line objects and",
    "@xmath13 4% for narrow line objects and in both cases that is small enough not to affect our conclusions regarding the origin of the nuclear nir emission .",

    "based on the optical broad line strengths and narrow emission lines ratios ( from @xcite ) we classified them into the stand groupings of high and low ionization galaxies ( hig and lig ) and broad line objects ( blo ) .",

    "the aim of this paper is to measure the nir nuclear sources . in order to disentangle such a component from the underlying stellar emission of the host galaxy , it is necessary to model the distribution of the galactic light . to this purpose",
    "we derived the surface brightness profile of all our sources .",
    "radial profiles can be derived using a number of different methods : ellipse fitting to the isophotes of the galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) obtaining a one - dimensional analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and full two - dimensional analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopted the first approach .",
    "the `` ellipse '' task in iraf stsdas @xcite is suitable to analyzing the axisymmetric structure , evident in most objects .",
    "this task allows us to trace the radial profile and radial changes in ellipticity , position angle , and coordinates of the center of the isophotes .",
    "most of the host galaxies of 3cr sources appear as smooth ellipticals in infrared . only in few cases",
    "are distortions due to dust lanes , jets , or plumes . before deriving the galaxy profile ,",
    "we mask out all spurious objects such as stars , jets , dust lanes , bright , galaxy companions and residual diffraction patterns associated with bright stars . when dust features are present in the nuclear region we adopted a multi - stage strategy .",
    "to stabilize the fit in the radial range affected by the dust we started by fixing some or all fit - parameters to the values of the last isophote that is not affected by the dust .",
    "we then produce an initial model image and we subtracted it from the original data to unveil the presence of further faint sources and/or dust features , that were then also masked out and so on until no further feature were found .    in fig .",
    "[ esempio ] we show the stages of the procedure to derive and to fit the radial brightness profile .",
    "the surface brightness profile can be fitted using a variety of functions .",
    "we used two different models , srsic and core - srsic .",
    "the former @xcite is a law of the form :    @xmath16}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the concentration parameter and @xmath10 = 1/n , the inverse of the srsic index n. i@xmath17 is the intensity at the effective radius r@xmath18 . for a srsic model with 0.5 @xmath13 n @xmath13 10 , b@xmath19 @xmath20 1.9992n - 0.3271 ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    the latter is composed of an outer srsic model and a inner power - law profile , suitable to describe the innermost part of the profile when the object shows a deficit toward the center with respect to the srsic law .",
    "@xcite argued that it is convenient to restrict the core - srsic model to an infinitely sharp transition between the srsic and power - law profiles at the break radius r@xmath21 , assuming this form :    @xmath22\\ ] ]    where r@xmath21 separates the inner power law of logarithmic slope @xmath23 from the outer part of the profile described by a srsic model .",
    "@xmath24(r@xmath21-r ) is the heaviside step function .",
    "we fit the brightness profiles with both models by minimizing the residuals , leaving free to vary the 5 ( or 7 ) variables : the background level , the three parameters describing the srsic ( or five for core - srsic ) model and the nuclear component . fig .  [ all ] illustrates four examples of fits to the nir brightness profiles . in sect .",
    "[ serocore ] we describe the method used to select the appropriate law for each galaxy .    to take into account the psf effects , we convolved the models prior to the comparison with the data @xcite .",
    "the psf of nicmos - nic2 at the center of the chip was derived using the tinytim program written by j. krist .",
    "the psf image was then convolved with a model galaxy with a power law profile , which represents the innermost region of a srsic / core - srsic model .",
    "this was done for a set of galaxy models with different profile slopes @xmath25 , all of them having zero ellipticity .",
    "we then derived the radial profile of the convolved model galaxies using circular isophotes , and we calculated the intensity ratio between the convolved model galaxy and the original model galaxy for different radii . with this method we obtained a set of radial ratios for different values of the innermost slope that can be applied to the models to `` simulate '' the two - dimensional convolution .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath25 was measured as part of the fitting procedure . in the case of a srsic model",
    ", @xmath25 is the value of the logarithmic slope of the profile at 0@xmath81 , which approximately corresponds to the resolution of nicmos - nic2 . in the core - srsic model",
    ", @xmath25 is the logarithmic slope of the inner power - law profile .",
    "@xcite already performed the fitting of the radial brightness profiles of 3cr sample with srsic law , focusing on their large scale behavior , thus not including the central region of the galaxies .",
    "for the objects in which @xcite found a disk - like component in the galaxy profile , we exclude from the fit the regions dominated by the disk .",
    "the parameter values found are mostly consistent with those of @xcite for the objects in which the nuclear component is not dominant with respect to the galaxy stellar emission .",
    "the resulting models produce residuals in the form of large scale fluctuations with a typical amplitude of @xmath1 5% , indicative of the goodness of the fit .",
    "besides the parameters describing the host galaxy profile , the fitting procedure also yields the flux of the nuclear source .    to assess the reliability of the detection of a nuclear source we adopt the following operative approach .",
    "we extract the radial brightness profile using the iraf `` radprof '' task and measure the nuclear fwhm , setting the background level at the intensity measured just beyond the nuclear point source at a radius of @xmath150.3 .",
    "if the fwhm is consistent with that of the psf ( @xmath15 0.14 arcsec ) , we took this as an indication of the presence of an unresolved source . alternatively ,",
    "if there was no evidence for a nuclear point source , we proceed to fit the profile with a core - srsic model leaving all parameters free to vary , but fixing @xmath26 .",
    "this corresponds to the most conservative choice for @xmath23 as it minimizes the galaxy contribution and maximizes the nuclear source .",
    "we consider the nuclear flux thus derived as the upper limit to the intensity of the central source .",
    "the choice between srsic and core - srsic model for a given galaxy is related to the corresponding minimized @xmath27 value obtained after the fitting procedure .",
    "since the core - srsic model includes more free parameters , the best core - srsic model usually will reproduce better the galaxy profile than the srsic model .",
    "therefore , to determine the goodness of the fit , we use the `` reduced '' @xmath27 ( @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the number of fitted data points and @xmath30 is the number of fitted parameters , which can be either 3 or 5 for srsic or core - srsic models , respectively ) .",
    "we consider the best model that corresponds to the @xmath31 closest to the unity .",
    "qualitatively , the choice can be justified by the form of the residuals . in fact , when fitting a core - srsic galaxy with a pure srsic model , the residuals in the central region show the characteristic s - shape , already discussed by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since our objects are at distances of up to z = 0.3 , we can misclassify a genuine core galaxy as a pure srsic due to an insufficient physical resolution of the image .",
    "the typical core size of an elliptical galaxy is @xmath15200 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which corresponds to 0@xmath814 at z = 0.15 .",
    "considering the objects at z @xmath7 0.15 with detected nuclei ( excluding the blos , for which the nucleus outshines the host galaxy emission in the central region ) , for which there is ambiguity on the presence of a core , the typical discrepancy between the estimates of the nuclear luminosity obtained adopting either a srsic law or a core - srsic model is @xmath32 % , and at most a factor of 2 .",
    "the sources potentially involved in this ambiguity are only @xmath1515% of the sample and thus they do not alter the main results of this paper .",
    "the presence of a bright point source may also limit our ability to see a possible shallow core and to discriminate between srsic and core - srsic models .",
    "however , in those cases ( e.g. in the case of the blos , fig.[sersiccores ] ) , the difference between the nuclear fluxes obtained adopting the two different models is irrelevant , being smaller than @xmath33% , thus well below the typical photometric error .",
    "in table  [ table1 ] we report the 1.6 @xmath0 m nir nuclear fluxes and luminosities for the sample measured with the procedure explained in sect .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "we also give the optical ( r band ) , radio ( nuclear at 5 ghz and large scale at 178 mhz ) fluxes , and [ o iii ] emission line luminosities for all the objects of the sample .",

    "more precisely , the presence of such a tight correlation between the nir and radio cores indicates that non thermal ( synchrotron ) radiation dominates their emission at all considered wavelengths , including the x - ray as shown by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the optical hst nuclei of 9 3cr / fr  i , which also belongs to our sample , are highly polarized .",
    "this strengthens the synchrotron origin of their nuclear emission .",

    "* ) , it is likely that the radio and the ir / optical radiation is produced in the innermost region of the jet , close to the black hole ( @xmath13 10@xmath77 cm ) , while the radio is emitted on larger scales .    the dominance of synchrotron radiation even in the",
    "nir indirectly confirms that accretion in most fr  i nuclei occurs at low rates and/or with low radiative efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". however , there are exceptions to this result : the clearest example is possibly 3c  120 ( a radio galaxy which is formally not part of 3cr sample ) which displays a radio morphology typical of fr  is ( e.g. @xcite ) while its nuclear emission shows the clear signature of broad lines and radiatively efficient accretion @xcite . on the other hand , exceptions are also present among bl  lacs , the putative `` beamed '' counterpart of lig population .",
    "a number of bl  lacs also show ( faint ) narrow and/or broad emission lines ( e.g. @xcite ) and others have fr  ii - like extended radio emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the dispersion of the radio - optical correlation ( @xmath15 0.4 dex ) is consistent with dust absorption , provided that the @xmath78 is randomly distributed among the sources and does not exceed @xmath15 2 mag .",
    "since the extinction in h - band is 4.5 times lower than in the optical r - band , the observations presented in this work are far less sensitive to the presence of dust along the line of sight than those in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one would expect the dispersion of the infrared - radio correlation to be smaller than that of the radio - optical , if that is due to absorption .",
    "our results instead show that the rms of the two correlations are similar .",
    "thus , the most likely explanation for the scatter is that variability of the nuclei plays a fundamental role , while the effect of absorption is less significant .",
    "indeed , this is supported by the variability observed for the nuclear flux of 3c  317 @xcite and of 3c  274 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the presence of dust appears to play a role in dimming the nuclear flux on the uv @xcite . note that data in the literature indicate that the radio core variability is typically at 10% over a time scale of several years @xcite",
    "therefore the main source of the scatter in the radio - nir correlation is mostly likely due to a variable nir nuclear component .    furthermore , the region of the jet base that produces the optical / nir emission in fr  is is likely to be mildly relativistic ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we consider the effects of doppler boosting on our results .",
    "firstly , the range in nir nuclear luminosity might be enhanced by relativistic beaming , which would boost ( or de - boost ) the emission of fr  i nuclei , depending on the viewing angle .",
    "objects seen under a small angle between the line - of - sight and the jet axis would appear boosted , while objects observed closer to the plane of the sky would be de - boosted .",
    "secondly , nuclear variability might be enhanced by relativistic beaming when the flux variation is associated with 1 ) a change in the jet bulk lorentz factor , or 2 ) a change in the jet direction , which would result in a different angle between the jet direction and the line - of - sight .    however , as noted by @xcite , the bulk lorentz factor of the component responsible for the nuclear optical / nir emission is most likely around @xmath79 and the source is possibly a `` slower '' shear layer in the jet .",
    "therefore , the effects of relativistic beaming should not dramatically affect our results .",
    "are the nir data telling us something new about the presence of optically and geometrically thick obscuring tori in fr  is with respect to the optical observations ? the results derived considering the uv , optical , and nir bands are only apparently in contradiction .",
    "in fact , the median absorption toward fr  i nuclei derived from uv observations is @xmath80 .",
    "this corresponds to only 0.2 mag in h band , negligible with respect to a dispersion of @xmath150.5 dex , and to @xmath81 mag at 2500  .",

    "all sources with an optical nucleus also show a nir counterpart , except 3c  310 . instead , in 3c  75n a faint dust lane prevents the study of its nuclear regions in the optical , while its nir core is clearly detected .",
    "furthermore , the absence of fr  i outliers in the l@xmath36/l@xmath50 ratio ( see right panel of fig .  [ oir ] ) can be interpreted as a hint that the _ detected _ fr  i nuclei are not affected by significant absorption ( @xmath82 mag ) .",
    "the reason for the non - detection of some of the fr  i nir nuclei might instead be due to a small contrast between the nucleus and the host galaxy stellar emission .",

    "an important result is that the correlations for fr  is and fr  ii ligs are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "this strengthens the hypothesis that the ligs are fr  ii galaxies with fr  i - like nuclei .",
    "such a nuclear similarity implies that non - thermal synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , from a relativistic jet ) dominates their nuclear emission in nir band and that accretion may occur with a radiatively inefficient process and/or at low accretion rates in fr  ii ligs as well .",

    "the large variety of extended radio morphologies associated with a central lig - like agn makes it difficult to understand how the properties of the core and extended radio structures are related ( e.g. @xcite ) . the existence of fr  ii ligs as a class shows that radiatively inefficient accretion disks are able to produce jets that give rise to the typical large scale fr  ii morphology .",

    "in fact , the fraction of detected fr  ii lig nuclei decreases as redshift increases , from 55 % for z@xmath10.15 to 29 % for z@xmath70.15 . however , at this stage we can not rule out that the presence of significant obscuration along the line of sight to the fr  ii ligs with non - detected nuclei might also contribute to the reduce the fraction of detected fr  ii lig nuclei .",

    "nevertheless , fr  ii ligs do show some differences with respect to fr  is .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alfaisto ] , fr  ii ligs and fr  is have slightly different radio - ir broad - band spectral indices . if fr  ii ligs are indeed the counterparts of bl  lacs with fr  ii radio morphology , the spectral index discrepancy can be explained in the framework of the so - called `` blazar sequence '' @xcite .",
    "such a scenario predicts a smooth transition in the properties of blazars spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in blazars ,",
    "the synchrotron emission peak is observed to shift towards lower frequencies as the radio luminosity at 5 ghz increases .",
    "the luminosity of the synchrotron emission peak also increases following the same trend .",

    "the blos show a strong nir excess , of up to two orders of magnitude in luminosity , with respect to the correlation defined by the fr  i ( and fr  ii lig ) radio - infrared nuclei ( fig .",
    "[ rir ] , right panel ) .",
    "a similar excess was already found in the optical band by @xcite interpreted that as thermal emission from the accretion disk .",
    "let us now explore the origin of their nir nuclear light .",
    "the infrared - optical spectral index for blos covers the range @xmath89 @xmath15 0 - 2 ( with the exception of 3c  111 for which @xmath89 = 3.3 ) .",
    "such a large range might result from a wide distribution of spectral indices ( see fig .",
    "11 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , variability may smear the intrinsic distribution .",
    "therefore we consider the median value @xmath90 .",
    "this value indicates that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blos is essentially flat in a @xmath51l@xmath91 representation .    to better investigate the origin of nir emission in the blos of our sample we compare their properties with those of the radio - loud qsos ( rlqso ) from @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated by those authors , the averaged sed of qsos shows a minimum at @xmath151@xmath0 m . for wavelengths shorter than 1@xmath0",
    "m the light is likely to be dominated by the accretion disk ( i.e. , the big blue bump ) , while for longer wavelengths a broad peak is observed , which is interpreted as emission from hot dust .",
    "the flat spectral index of blos is an indication that , on average , the optical and nir hst observations are located on opposite sides of the sed minimum . therefore , by analogy with rlqsos , we then conclude that in most 3cr / blos the h band light is mainly produced by the high temperature tail of the hot dust emission , located at the inner face of the obscuring material .",
    "we estimate a spectral index of @xmath89 = 0.35 from the averaged sed of rlqsos after adopting the mean redshift of blos ( z = 0.14 ) .",
    "the difference of the spectral indices between rlqsos and blos can be accounted by an nir / optical flux ratio of the blos larger by a factor @xmath152 than that of rlqsos .",
    "this is an indication of a relatively larger contribution from the dust in infrared emission of blos than that observed in rlqsos .",
    "furthermore , reminding the reader that the rlqso have optical and nir luminosities a factor of 100 - 1000 higher than those of the 3cr / blos , there is a dependence of the optical - infrared spectral index on the luminosity of the object .      at odds with the results found for fr  ii ligs and",
    "fr  is , the nir emission of hig nuclei does not correlate with the radio cores .",
    "furthermore , most of the detected nuclei exceeds the emission of fr  is and fr  ii ligs at a given radio - core luminosity , suggesting an additional component dominating over the jet emission , similar to what we found for the blos",
    ".    however , hig nuclei are substantially fainter than those of the blos , on average by a factor of 50 .",
    "this is expected in a standard unification scheme , since the higs are considered to be the obscured counter parts of blos .",
    "this result indicates that substantial obscuration is still present in the nir , despite the reduced effects of dust in the h band .    in order to investigate the origin of nir emission in higs ,",
    "we follow the method described by @xcite who studied a complete sub - sample of the 3cr radio catalog , which includes all higs with z @xmath1 0.3 , observed in k@xmath92 band from the ground .",

    "then , for each source , @xcite plotted l@xmath93/l@xmath36 against l@xmath35/l@xmath36 , which are both sensitive to nuclear obscuration .",
    "they found that higs do not follow the ` reddening line ' ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ marchesini ] ) in such a plane , as one might expect if they were simply `` partially obscured '' blo nuclei .",
    "this lead them to conclude that a substantial role is played by scattered nuclear light .",
    "with respect to @xcite our analysis can rely on _ direct _ measurements of the nir nuclei and these are available for a larger number of hig , due to better sensitivity of the hst images to faint ir nuclei .",
    "furthermore , we also have nir data for the nuclei of blo , thus providing a more robust estimate of the location of unreddened sources .    in agreement with the results",
    "@xcite we found that only a few higs are located along the reddening line in fig .",
    "[ marchesini ] but this is clearly not the case for the whole population .",
    "we then include the effects of scattered nuclear light . in this scenario",

    "the effects of varying a@xmath96 is as follows : an increase of the nuclear obscuration simply corresponds to an increase of l@xmath93/@xmath51l@xmath36 .",
    "the behavior of l@xmath35/l@xmath36 is more complex : initially , an increase of the absorption moves the point ( starting from the average location of blo ) to the right , along the reddening line . at larger values of a@xmath96 the direct ( transmitted )",
    "optical light becomes fainter than the scattered component , while the infrared nucleus is still substantially unaltered . at even higher values of a@xmath96 ,",
    "the infrared transmitted component starts to decrease ; since the scattered optical component remains constant this causes an increase of l@xmath50/l@xmath36 , producing a turnover in the source path .",
    "the track ends at the same ratio of l@xmath35/l@xmath36 found for blos , but shifted downward by a factor linked to a@xmath96 .",
    "the location of the turnover instead depends on the fraction of scattered light @xmath97 , moving to smaller l@xmath35/l@xmath36 and to larger l@xmath93/@xmath51l@xmath36 with decreasing @xmath97 .     and @xmath51l@xmath36 versus the ratio between l@xmath35 and l@xmath36 .",
    "the blos are the red triangles and the higs the green squares .",
    "the solid oblique line is the reddening line that purely obscured objects should follow .",
    "the origin of this line is determined by the ratios measured for blos , i.e. log(l@xmath93/@xmath51l@xmath36 ) = 1.17@xmath400.15 and log(l@xmath50/l@xmath36 ) = -0.28@xmath400.11 .",
    "the dashed region reproduces the uncertainty of its origin .",
    "the dotted vertical line corresponds to the average value of log(l@xmath50/l@xmath36 ) measured for blos .",
    "the grid of dotted curves represent the effects of varying the nuclear a@xmath98 and the fraction of scattered light @xmath97 ( see the eq.3 in @xcite ) . ]",
    "because both the ir and the optical emission is most likely variable , therefore non - simultaneous measurements may lead to large errors in the estimate of the intrinsic l@xmath50/l@xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , this does not compromise the analysis : while a handful higs can be interpreted with being purely obscured blos , most of them ( approximately 3/4 of the sample ) require obscuration as well as scattered light , in the range of 10@xmath1a@xmath96@xmath130 and 0.02%@xmath9910% respectively .",
    "this agrees with the general results of @xcite ( they derived a fraction of @xmath1570% ) and also considering higs on a object - by - object basis .",
    "our analysis of the brightness profiles of the 3cr sources always assumed that the nuclear nir components are unresolved . while for the other classes of 3cr galaxies the nuclear sources",
    "are directly associated with the agn ( and thus effectively point - like at our resolution ) , for higs our results suggest that they are in general dominated by scattered light , a spatially resolved component .",
    "this is confirmed by several observations of imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry of radio - galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we then re - modeled the observed nir brightness profiles taking into account the possibility that the central hig sources are actually resolved and can be described by a gaussian light distribution .",
    "we considered in detail the three objects ( 3c  234 in polarized flux ( @xcite ) . ] , 3c  300 , and 3c  349 ) that should have the larger scattered light fraction , being located closer to the grid origin in fig .",
    "[ marchesini ] . for sizes larger than @xmath15",
    "@xmath100 significant residuals start to appear in the model fitting and we consider this value as an upper limit to the size of the scattering region .",
    "this corresponds to a range of 300 - 400 pc for these three objects , consistent with the size of the seyfert polar scattering zone .",
    "this does not mean that there is no scattered light outside this region ( as in e.g. 3c  321 , @xcite ) , but it must be taken as an indication that the bulk of scattering occurs within this scale .",
    "the presence of low surface brightness scattered components ( in contrast to the host galaxy ) can only be probed with imaging polarimetry .",
    "we conclude that hig , unlike fr  ii ligs , are consistent with the interpretation that they host a hidden quasar , but they are not simply partially obscured blo .",
    "scattered light must provide a substantial contribution to their nuclei in both the optical and nir bands .",
    "we have analyzed 1.6 @xmath0 m near infrared images of 100 3cr radio galaxies from hst nicmos in the f160w band with z @xmath1 0.3 , @xmath1590% of the whole 3cr sample .",
    "on the basis of the radio morphology we divided the sample between fr  i and fr  ii and from the point of view of their optical spectra we also classified them as low ionization galaxies ( lig ) , high ionization galaxies ( hig ) , and broad line objects ( blo ) .",
    "we measured the nuclear nir luminosity of all the objects , by subtracting the 1-d radial brightness profile ( modeled with a srsic or core - srsic law representing the galaxy emission ) from the total profile derived from the isophote fitting of the images .",
    "the nir nuclear emission is found to be strongly correlated with radio cores for fr  is .",
    "the linear correlation extends over @xmath15 4 dex in luminosity with a rms of 0.4 dex and it has slope consistent with unity , as already found for the relations with optical and x - ray nuclei .",
    "this correlation provides further support to the identification of their nuclear emission as the synchrotron radiation produced in the inner part of the relativistic jet . in turn",
    "this implies a low contribution from thermal emission , an indication for the presence of radiatively inefficient disks .",
    "the similar dispersions for the correlations in nir and in optical with the radio cores ascribes to the nuclear variability the dominant role of this scatter , rather than to obscuration .",
    "the large number of fr  ii ligs present in this sample made possible for the first time a detailed analysis their nuclear properties in radio - infrared plane .",
    "we found a strong linear correlation between radio and nir emission .",
    "the multiwavelength properties of fr  ii lig nuclei are statistically indistinguishable from those of fr  is , indicating a common structure of the central engine , despite the difference in radio morphology and radio power .",
    "the similar nuclear properties suggest that the nuclei of fr  ii ligs belong to the same class of those of fr  is , i.e. , the nucleus is dominated by non - thermal emission from a relativistic jet .",
    "all blos have detected nir nuclei and show an nir excess with respect to the fr  i - fr  ii lig radio - infrared correlation .",
    "this excess does not correlate with the radio cores , suggesting the presence of an additional infrared emitting component . in analogy with the properties of radio - quiet qso , their optical nuclei",
    "most likely originate from the thermal emission of the accretion disk .",
    "since their optical - infrared spectral indices are essentially flat , this suggests that thermal infrared emission from hot dust dominates in the nir .",
    "the origin of the nir nuclei of higs is more complex .",
    "although a few hig nuclei lie on the fr  i - fr  ii lig radio - infrared correlation , most of them show a large nir excess which does not correlate with the radio cores .",
    "this means that synchrotron emission from the jet base is not sufficient to explain their nuclear luminosities .",
    "nonetheless , the hig nir nuclei are less luminous than those of blos , by a factor of 50 on average , suggesting partial obscuration , as expected by the unified model . yet",
    "the infrared - optical luminosity ratios for higs are not consistent with a model of higs as the purely - obscured counterpart of the blos .",
    "we found that this inconsistency can be solved by including a significant contribution from nuclear light reflected in a compact circumnuclear scattering region .",
    "the sources which show the largest scattered light contribution , have a scatter region of 300 - 400 pc ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the analysis of the properties of the nir nuclear sources of 3cr radio - galaxies presented here broadly confirms the indications derived from the study of the optical nuclei . in particular , the presence of two classes of radio - loud agn , lig and hig , with different nuclear properties is strengthened .",
    "fr  i radio - galaxies as well as the sub - population of sources with fr  ii morphology characterized by a low ionization optical spectrum belong to the same class from the nuclear point of view . in these sources",
    "the mechanism of emission related to the presence of non - thermal plasma from their radio - jets dominates over the contribution from thermal radiation related to the accretion process .",
    "moving from optical to infrared observations has no substantial effect despite the reduced absorption at longer observing wavelengths .",
    "however the nir band is not the optimal band to investigate the issue of obscuring tori .",
    "the data preseneted here leave the results based on optical observations unchanged , bearing in mind that for most of fr  is we have a clear view to their optical / infrared nucleus . while mir spitzer spectra @xcite obtained with a large slit size ( 10.7 ) do show an infrared excess with respect to the jet emission in three fr  i sources ( and in one fr  ii lig )",
    ", our results on 3cr sample do not directly require the presence of dusty torus on the line of sight to the fr  i nucleus .",
    "furthermore , although @xcite argue that the dust emission is powered the nucleus , the comparison between mir spectra and hst data is extremely difficult because of the different spatial resolution of the two instruments . on the other hand , at this stage we can not rule out the presence of a dusty torus in these objects because of the higher distance of the fr  ii ligs than that of fr  is . despite the lack of such information , the nuclear properties of fr  ii lig nuclei are found to be statistically indistinguishable from those of fr  is .",
    "how all the sources of the fr  i / fr  ii lig group can be associated with such a large range of radio power , while still maintaining their disks in radiatively inefficient state , and what causes the transition to the fr  ii morphology in ligs remain open questions .",
    "the nir data provide new insights also for the second class of objects , formed by higs and blos . the blo nir nuclei are likely to be dominated by the emission from hot dust located in the immediate vicinity of the active nucleus .",
    "in hig we found many examples of nuclei in which the nir emission is substantially larger than in the optical . due to the proximity of the two bands , the only mechanism that can explain this effect is the presence of nuclear structures covered by absorbing material , optically thin at least in the infrared .",
    "scattered light must provide a substantial contribution to their nuclei in both the optical and nir bands .",
    "the lack of broad emission line in higs is universally associated with a substantially decreased luminosity of their nuclei in the infrared band and to a different angle of sight to the nucleus .",
    "this implies that obscuration still plays a substantial role .",
    "the detailed comparison of radio , optical , and infrared data for the 3cr sample also shows that the differences in the relative contribution in these bands , on a object - by - object basis , is dominated by variability and not by absorption .",
    "thus , only simultaneous nuclear data would allow us to explore intrinsic differences among the sources of the sample .",
    "the lack of such data effectively hampers the use of the nuclear spectral energy distribution to enlighten how they vary with e.g. , source power and viewing angle .",
    "r.d.b . acknowledges the financial support ( hst - go-11219.07-a grant ) from space telescope science institute , baltimore .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , r. antonucci for the extremely careful and detailed report which stimulated us and significantly contribuited to greatly improve the paper .",
    "we also thank g.  k. miley for useful comments .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the radio and nir correlation for fr  is by considering radio data of higher angular resolution . to this aim , we take from the literature the fluxes at 5 ghz obtained with vlbi observations .",
    "the fr  is for which the vlbi radio data are available are listed in table  5 . in fig .",
    "[ vlbiir ] ( left panel ) we show the correlations in the l@xmath102-l@xmath36 planes .",
    "the linear correlation coefficient is r = 0.90 ( p = 4.1@xmath910@xmath76 ) .",
    "these values as well as the slope and the intercept of the derived correlations are essentially identical to those obtained with the vla data .",
    "the reason of these similarities can be explained by looking at fig .",
    "[ vlbiir ] ( right panel ) , which shows the vla core flux of fr  is plotted vs. their vlbi flux .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the two measurements lead to very similar flux values .",
    "the dispersion is extremely small , with the exception of only two outliers ( 3c  84 and ngc  6251 ) , for which the vla flux is higher than that of vlbi by a factor of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "however , since these two objects have a relatively high core dominance , they are likely to be observed at a small angle with respect to jet axis and thus they are more likely to be affected by flux variability .",
    "that might explain the larger discrepancy between the vla and vlbi fluxes for these two sources with respect to the other fr  is .",
    "summarizing , the correlation between the vlbi and the ir nuclear luminosity is statistically indistinguishable from that obtained using the vla cores simply because the core fluxes measured with vla and vlbi are only marginally different .",
