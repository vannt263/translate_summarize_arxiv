    ", vigoda @xcite gives an approximation algorithm with such a time bound for the permanent ( of a matrix with non - negative entries ) settling this important open problem .",

    "dyer , frieze and the author @xcite gave polynomial time algorithm for estimating the volume to any specified relative error @xmath13 .",
    "they first reduce the problem to that of drawing a random point from the convex set ( with uniform probability density ) .",

    "the ising partition function is defined as @xmath26 jerrum and sinclair @xcite presented a polynomial time approximation algorithm to compute @xmath27 in the case when all @xmath28 are non - negative ( called the ferromagnetic case ) .",

    "-5 mm    alon and milman @xcite and sinclair and jerrum @xcite related @xmath56 to a combinatorial quantity called `` conductance '' ( in what may be looked on as a discrete analog of cheeger s inequality for manifolds ) .",
    "this has turned out to be of great use in practice ; often , first proofs of polynomial time convergence use conductance .",
    "for any two subsets @xmath65 of states , the _ ergodic flow _ from @xmath66 to @xmath32 ( denoted @xmath67 ) is defined as @xmath68 .",
    "the conductance @xmath69 is defined by : @xmath70 @xmath71 is the probability of escaping from @xmath66 to @xmath72 conditioned on starting in @xmath66 in the steady state ; since @xmath48 may be this distribution , it is intuitively clear that if the conductance of any set is low , then the mixing time is high .",
    "more interestingly , @xcite and @xcite show also a converse .",
    "[ cond ] for a time - reversible , lazy , ergodic markov chain with conductance @xmath69 , we have @xmath73    while conductance has helped bound the mixing time for some complicated chains ( including the three examples mentioned in the introduction ) , it is not a fine enough tool to give the correct bounds for some simple chains .",
    "for example , consider the lazy version of the random walk on the @xmath74 vertices on the @xmath1 * cube * , where in each step , one picks at random one of the @xmath2 neighbours of the current vertex to go to .",
    "the mixing time is known to be @xmath75 .",
    "conductance is @xmath76 for this example , yielding only a mixing time of @xmath77 by theorems ( [ cond ] ) and ( [ theorem1 ] ) .",
    "a striking contrast is the random walk on the vertices of the * cube truncated * by a half - space ( i.e. , the set of 0 - 1 vectors satisfying a given linear inequality . ) morris and sinclair @xcite showed that the conductance of this walk is at least @xmath78 for a polynomial @xmath79 .",
    "we now discuss a recent improvement of conductance for chains with a finite number of states from @xcite , @xcite ; similar results hold for chains with infinite number of states .",
    "in addition to measuring the ergodic flow from @xmath66 to @xmath72 , we now also see if the flow is `` well - spread out '' in the sense that we `` block '' a set @xmath80 , and then see if @xmath81 is still high .",
    "we now define for @xmath66 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 it is easy to show that a set @xmath24 with @xmath84 , blocks at most 1/2 of the flow from @xmath66 to @xmath72 , so we have @xmath85 .",
    "thus , an assertion that mixing time is @xmath86 would be at least as strong a result as we get from theorems ( [ cond ] ) and ( [ theorem1 ] ) .",
    "we prove a theorem which implies this assertion ; indeed , instead of taking @xmath87 , the theorem takes an `` average '' of this quantity over different set sizes .",
    "we say that @xmath88\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] is a `` blocking conductance function '' ( b.c.f . )",
    "if ( the second condition is technical ) @xmath89    [ avcond ] if @xmath90 is a blocking conductance function of a lazy , ergodic , time - reversible , finite markov chain , with @xmath91 , then , the mixing time is at most @xmath92    this has been used to improve the analysis of the ball walk for convex sets in @xcite and also some other examples in @xcite . also , @xcite uses theorem ( [ avcond ] ) to argue that the mixing time of the grid lattice , ( in a fixed number of dimensions ) where some edges have failed according to a standard percolation model is still within a constant of the mixing time of the whole .",
    "-5 mm    another important technique for proving rapid mixing is `` coupling''@xcite .",
    "a _ coupling _ is a stochastic process @xmath93 , where each of @xmath94 and @xmath95 is marginally a copy of the chain .",
    "[ they may be mutually dependent .",
    "] so , we run `` two copies '' of the chain @xmath96 in tandem .",
    "if @xmath97 is distributed according to @xmath98 , the steady state distribution , then , the distribution @xmath99 of @xmath100 , satisfies @xmath101 to apply this , one must construct a coupling @xmath96 for which @xmath100 and @xmath102 `` meet '' as fast as possible . this can prove difficult .",
    "path coupling introduced by bubley and dyer @xcite which we describe now simplifies the task quite a bit . in path coupling",
    ", we have an underlying connected directed graph @xmath31 on the set of states .",
    "( @xmath31 could just be the graph of the markov chain . )",
    "@xmath31 defines distances between pairs of states - namely the length of the shortest path in @xmath31 .",
    "we only need to define a coupling of adjacent pairs of vertices , with the property that for every pair of adjacent ( in @xmath31 ) vertices @xmath103 , the expected distance between the next states of @xmath104 is at most @xmath105 .",
    "they then show that    [ pathcoupling ] if @xmath106 is the diameter ( of @xmath31 ) , then for any @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "propp and wilson @xcite have designed a method they call * coupling from the past*. this applies to chains with a partial order on the set of states with a least state @xmath109 and a greatest state @xmath110 . they show that running two copies of the chain backwards - one from @xmath109 and one from @xmath110 - with a coupling satisfying a certain monotonicity condition until they `` meet '' gives us a good upper bound on the number of steps needed to mix .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "-5 mm    one way to prove a lower bound on conductance for a chain with a finite set of states @xmath3 is to construct a family of @xmath111 paths - one from each state to each other using as edges the transitions of the markov chain , so that no transition is `` overloaded '' by too many paths .",
    "we do not supply here any more details of this technique referred to as the method of `` canonical paths '' and used by jerrum and sinclair @xcite .",
    "we may look upon the construction of these paths as routing a multi - commodity flow through the network and apply techniques from network flows .",
    "@xcite pursues this .",
    "@xcite uses different measures of congestion to achieve improved results in some cases and their methods are applied in @xcite .    another important method is the use of logarithmic sobolev inequalities , where , we use ( relative ) entropy - @xmath112 as the measure of distance .",
    "it is known that for ergodic markov chains , this distance declines exponentially @xcite ; i.e. , there is a constant @xmath113 such that @xmath114 note that @xmath115 .",
    "so , it suffices to choose @xmath116 @xmath117 to reduce the entropy to @xmath118 ; the dependence on @xmath119 is thus better .",
    "but we need to determine @xmath120 which is only known for simple chains .",
    "it is known that @xmath121 , so the most that this method could save over using something like theorem ( [ theorem1 ] ) is the @xmath122 factor . @xcite and",
    "@xcite contain several comparisons between the log - sobolev inequalities , eigenvalue bounds and conductance .",
    "@xcite uses the log - sobolev inequality to prove better bounds on the metropolis version of the coordinate random walk for log - concave functions .",
    "for the random walk on the cube a simple coupling argument , which , moves both @xmath100 and @xmath102 in the same coordinate , trying to make them equal - shows that mixing time is @xmath75 .",
    "some sophisticated fourier transform methods have been used to get much more exact results here and the results are applicable in other contexts too .",
    "a traditional approach to sampling from a probability distribution involves the so - called `` stopping rules '' @xcite , where one specifies a rule for when to stop the markov chain and shows that if we follow the rule , we sample ( exactly ) from the desired distribution .",
    "@xcite contain results about the expected time needed for certain stopping rules , which then serves as an upper bound on the number of steps needed to converge .",
    "we also mention two general techniques for deriving convergence rates of a markov chain from the knowledge of convergence rates for a simpler - to - analyze chain .",
    "the first one is called comparison and is developed in @xcite . the second technique is called decomposition @xcite ; here one decomposes the chain into chains on subsets of states and derives a bound on the convergence rate of the whole chain based on the rates for the `` sub - chains '' and the interconnections between them .",

    "jerrum , sinclair and vigoda @xcite develop an algorithm for the general 0 - 1 permanent ( including the non - dense case ) .",

    "the final element of the sequence has low enough weights for the non - edges that it gives a good approximation to the permanent .",

    "<S> a wide class of `` counting '' problems have been studied in computer science . </S>",
    "<S> three typical examples are the estimation of - ( i ) the permanent of an @xmath0 0 - 1 matrix , ( ii ) the partition function of certain @xmath1 particle statistical mechanics systems and ( iii ) the volume of an @xmath1 dimensional convex set . these problems can be reduced to sampling from the steady state distribution of implicitly defined markov chains with exponential ( in @xmath2 ) number of states . </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this talk is the proof that such markov chains converge to the steady state fast ( in time polynomial in @xmath2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a combinatorial quantity called conductance is used for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> there are other techniques as well which we briefly outline . </S>",
    "<S> we then illustrate on the three examples and briefly mention other examples .    </S>",
