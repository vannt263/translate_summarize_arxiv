    "if , at time @xmath85 , the quasi - particle s state was @xmath220 , then at time @xmath49 , the state of the particle is @xmath221 where @xmath222 is feynman s propagator @xcite @xmath223 where @xmath224 is a path integral over all trajectories from @xmath225 to @xmath10 .",

    "in the previous sections , we have shown how to describe the evolution of systems when we have imprecise knowledge about the system s states and dynamics laws .",
    "the main assumptions , which are the basis for this approach , are : 1)-limit condition ( [ e1.14]),([e1.14a ] ) , 2)-causality principle in the fuzzy form and 3)-local topology of a system s state space . we have shown that these assumptions inevitably lead to hamiltonian ( [ e2.10])-([e2.10b ] ) or lagrangian equations of motion ( [ e2.13])-([e2.13a ] ) , if the system s evolution is described in @xmath1 dimensional space , where @xmath0 is the system s dimensionality , while the additional dimension can be considered as the mechanical action .",
    "assumptions 2 ) and 3 ) are very general and can be applied to almost all systems , while in 1 ) it should be assumed that  physical points \" of the state space have a finite size and can not be infinitely small .",
    "this means that the lagrangian or hamiltonian equations of motion could fail at a very small scale .    as mentioned above , the membership function @xmath258 and possibility function @xmath259 are not equivalent to any kind of probabilities and , generally speaking , can not be measured .",
    "in fact , concrete values of @xmath258 and @xmath260 for intermediate @xmath261 are  human dependent \" and only the values @xmath262 are objective , which reflects the nature of the fuzzy approach . as a rule",
    ", several experts will be consistent about the statements : `` _ _ at an initial time the system s state @xmath263 is preferable to the state @xmath264 _ _ '' or `` _ _ if the system is in state @xmath263 then after a short time the state @xmath264 will be preferable to the state @xmath265 _ _ '' , but if we will ask them to assign possibilities for each state or transition , they will come up with different numbers and the possibilities of one expert may not add up to those another .",
    "this means that only correlation of preferability of events contains objective information in the description of a problem .",
    "the subjectiveness of the intermediate values of @xmath258 and @xmath260 , however , does not present a serious problem .",
    "indeed , the master equation ( [ e1.17 ] ) is covariant under the transformations @xmath266 if @xmath79 $ ] is a _ consistent _ t - norm @xcite , meaning that @xmath267 ) = t[\\psi(p),\\psi(\\mu)],\\ ] ] where@xmath268 is a monotonically increasing function with @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "it is obvious that under such transformations , only memberships grades of trajectories are changed , while the picture of the trajectories remains unchanged .",
    "moreover , the most possible lagrangian and picture of the most possible trajectories , @xmath271 , remain unchanged for any choice of @xmath79 $ ] and any `` experts - dependent '' definition of intermediate values of @xmath93 .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ e2.10])-([e2.10b ] ) and ( [ e2.13])-([e2.13a ] ) are more general than the usual hamiltonian and lagrangian equations in several ways . in some cases",
    ", they could be differential inclusions instead of differential equations , as they describe the dynamics of sets instead dynamics of points .",
    "unfortunately , the mathematical apparatus of differential inclusions is poorly developed , and to date , we have only a few examples of explicit solutions of differential inclusions .",
    "hence , this is much work to be done in this direction .",
    "the second extension is _ dependence of the lagrangian on action _ ( @xmath114-lagrangian ) . in this case , the lagrangian equations of motion acquire a non - zero right side , proportional to derivative of the @xmath114-lagrangian with respect to the action .",
    "we have seen in section [ nonphyssys ] that even in simple cases , this leads to considerable changes in the system s behavior . moreover , many features of the usual lagrangian approach are lost .",
    "for example , the equations of motion with @xmath114-lagrangian lose all additive integrals , they irreversible with respect to time and non - invariant under the addition to the lagrangian of a function which is a total derivative with respect to time . on the other hand ,",
    "this generalization allows one to define an @xmath114-lagrangian for dissipative systems and systems which  remember \" their history .",
    "it should be emphasized that our derivation of the equations of motion do not depend on any specific properties of the system or its lagrangian .",
    "this means that equations ( [ e2.10])-([e2.10b ] ) , ( [ e2.13])-([e2.13a ] ) and ( [ e2.2c])-([e2.3 ] ) give a reasonable method of applying the hamiltonian or lagrangian approach to non - physical systems .",
    "an example of such an application was presented in section [ nonphyssys ] .",
    "our brain is an unique object and can produce models of the world around us through  perceptions \" of the environment .",
    "numerous sources in the literature and original experiments considered in @xcite lead us to believe that the capability of perceiving takes place already on the neuron level and that the neural cell s processing of information could be close to fuzzy dynamics .",
    "the results of this paper give us some hint why the hamiltonian or lagrangian approach was so successful during the last centuries : the basic properties of this approach could be well compatible with the basic functioning of ourwet - ware \" - neurons .",
    "hence ,  background \" processes of the brain ( intuition ) could work quite effectively when we use this way of thinking about the world .",
