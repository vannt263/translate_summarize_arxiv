    "the kazhdan - lusztig theory deeply increases our understanding of coxeter groups and their representations and their role in lie representation theory .",
    "the central concepts in kazhdan - lusztig theory include kazhdan - lusztig polynomial , kazhdan - lusztig basis , cell , based ring .",
    "kazhdan - lusztig polynomials play an essential role in understanding certain remarkable representations in lie theory , for instances , the representations of quantum groups at roots of 1 , the modular representations of algebraic groups , the representations of kac - moody algebras .",
    "kazhdan - lusztig basis and cells are very useful in understanding structure and representations of coxeter groups and their hecke algebras .",
    "the based ring of a two - sided cell of certain coxeter groups is defined through kazhdan - lusztig basis by lusztig in [ l5 ] .",
    "the based ring is very interesting in understanding the concerned hecke algebras and their representations ( see [ l5 , l6 , l8 ] ) .",
    "moreover we can construct irreducible representations of the hecke algebras if we know the structure of the based ring explicitly ( see [ x3 ] ) .",
    "this fact is remarkable since constructing computable irreducible modules of affine hecke algebras is in general difficult .",
    "recently lusztig introduced periodic @xmath1-graphs for constructing finite dimensional modules of affine hecke algebras ( see [ l9 ] ) .",
    "for the structure of the based ring of a two - sided cell in a weyl group or in an affine weyl group , lusztig has two nice conjectures , one for weyl groups ( see [ l7 ] ) and the other for affine weyl groups that says the based ring is isomorphic to a certain equivariant @xmath2-group ( see [ l8 ] ) .",
    "the conjecture for weyl groups is proved by lusztig ( unpublished ) . the conjecture for affine weyl groups",
    "is proved for rank 2 cases , for the lowest two - sided cell of an affine weyl group and for the second highest two - sided cell of an affine weyl group , see [ x1 , x3 ] . as an application",
    ", the author gives a classification of irreducible modules of the hecke algebras of affine weyl groups of rank 2 for any non - zero parameter , see [ x3 ] .",
    "( when the parameter is not a root of 1 , kazhdan and lusztig worked out the classification of irreducible modules of an affine hecke algebra , see [ kl2 ] . ) also the author computed the irreducible modules of affine hecke algebras associated with second highest two - sided cell , see [ x3 ] .",
    "recently ram has developed an interesting combinatorical approach to study representations of affine hecke algebras , see [ r1 , r2 ] .    in this paper we will prove lusztig conjecture on based ring for an extended affine weyl group associated with the general linear group @xmath3 or the special linear group @xmath4 , which is of type @xmath0 .",
    "let us here briefly explain the idea of the proof of the conjecture for type @xmath0 .",
    "for each two - sided cell of the extended affine weyl group associated with @xmath3 , we first show that the based ring of the two - sided cell is a matrix algebra over the based ring of the intersection of a left cell in the two - sided cell and its inverse ( a right cell ) .",
    "then we show that the based ring of the intersection is isomorphic to the ( rational ) representation ring of a certain connected reductive algebraic group over complex numbers .",
    "the main difficulty is to establish a bijection between the intersection ( of a left cell in the two - sided cell and its inverse ) and the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible rational representations of the algebraic group , and to show that the bijection leads to the isomorphism between the based ring of the intersection and the representation ring of the algebraic group .",
    "the bijection is established in chapter 5 . in chapters 6 and 7",
    "we prove several formulas in the based ring of the intersection , the corresponding formulas in the representation ring of the concerned algebraic group are obvious . using the formulas established in chapters 6 and 7 , in chapter 8",
    "we show that the bijection in chapter 5 is the right one . in chapter 8",
    "we also show that lusztig conjecture on based ring is true for the extended affine weyl group associated with @xmath4 and can not be generalized to arbitrary extended affine weyl groups .",
    "the contents of the paper are as follows .    in chapter 1",
    "we recall some basic definitions and facts about cells and based rings . in section 1.4",
    "we prove some simple properties about the structure constants of a based ring that are important to our proof of lusztig conjecture on based ring for an affine weyl group of type @xmath5 . in chapter 2",
    "we discuss the structure of cells in the extended affine weyl group associated with @xmath3 .",
    "the cells in the extended affine weyl group are explicitly described by shi and lusztig ( see [ s , l3 ] ) . in section 2.3 , we show that the based ring of a two - sided cell of the extended affine weyl group is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over the based ring of the intersection of any given left cell in the two - sided cell and its inverse ( a right cell ) . thus to understand the based ring of the two - sided cell , we only need to work out the structure of the based ring of the intersection of a left cell in the two - sided cell and its inverse . in section 2.4",
    "we discuss chains and antichains defined by shi , which are essential for our bijection between the intersection of a left cell and its inverse and the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible rational representations of the corresponding algebraic group .",
    "in chapter 3 we give some discussion to canonical left cells .",
    "although we do not need the results in this chapter for the proof of our main result of the paper , but for other types canonical left cells maybe play a big role for some questions such as lusztig conjecture on based ring and properties of lusztig bijection between the set of two - sided cells of an affine weyl group and the set of unipotent classes of the corresponding algebraic group .    in chapter 4",
    "we describe the reductive algebraic group corresponding to a two - sided cell in the extended affine weyl group associated with @xmath3 and recall some needed results about the representation ring of a general linear group over complex numbers .    in chapter 5",
    "we establish a bijection between the intersection of a left cell and its inverse and the set of dominant weights of the corresponding reductive algebraic group .",
    "we obtain this bijection by means of antichains and this bijection is one key to our main result .    in chapters 6 and 7 we work with the based ring of the intersection of a left cell and its inverse .",
    "believing in that lusztig conjecture is true , motivated by some simple multiplication formulas in the representation ring of the concerned reductive algebraic group , we prove some multiplication formulas in the based ring . using the formulas in chapters 6 and 7 , in chapter 8 we prove that the based ring of the intersection is isomorphic to the representation ring of the corresponding reductive algebraic group .",
    "this completes our proof of lusztig conjecture on based ring for type @xmath0 . in chapter 8",
    "we also discuss the based rings of extended affine weyl groups associated with the projective linear group @xmath6 and with the special linear group @xmath4 .",
    "it is expected that the explicit knowledge on the based rings will have nice application to representation theory of the concerned affine hecke algebras .",
    "it is interesting that we can use the explicit structure on based ring to find leading coefficients of some kazhdan - lusztig polynomials , the details will appear elsewhere .",
