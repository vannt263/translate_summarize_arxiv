    "in many problems of physical and biological interest we consider nonlinear oscillators whose interaction is mediated by a substance which is secreted by the cells and diffuses along the inter - cellular medium , being absorbed by the cells .",
    "moreover , the rate of secretion depends on the cell dynamics , as well as the rate of absorption . in this way",
    "the dynamics of the cells are effectively coupled by the diffusing substance , leading to a non - local coupling type which depends on the details of the diffusion process as well as the dynamics of the oscillators themselves , leading to a complex system which displays a wealth of dynamical behaviors , like periodic and chaotic regimes , bifurcations , crises , destruction of tori , among other features .",
    "an outstanding biological example of interaction mediated by a chemical is the collective behavior of brain cells responsible by the circadian rhythm .",
    "the circadian rhythm is a daily periodicity ( roughly a @xmath0 hr cycle ) of physiological , biochemical , and behavioral processes in living beings @xcite .",
    "it is produced in mammals by specialized cells ( circadian clocks ) belonging to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) of the anterior hypothalamus @xcite .",
    "the scn consists of multiple , single - cell circadian clocks which , when synchronized , produce a coherent circadian output that regulate overt rhythms @xcite .",
    "the circadian master clock of the scn is entrained by the daily light - dark cycle , which acts via retina - to - scn neural pathways @xcite . hence , to obtain a coordinated circadian rhythm , the master clock cell must be coupled to the other cells in the scn so as to synchronize them to its own rhythm .",
    "the chemical coupling between circadian clocks can be described by means of a chemical ( @xmath1-aminobutyric acid , or gaba , for short ) which is both secreted and absorbed by clock cells immersed in some the intra - cellular medium .",
    "the coupling , in this case , is non - local in the sense that it takes into account cells which are not necessarily close to each other .",
    "an extreme situation belonging to this general category is the so - called global coupling , in which each cell interacts with the average concentration of the chemical in the inter - cellular medium due to all the other cells @xcite .",
    "another situation in which this kind of coupling is potentially important is chemotaxis , which is the influence of chemicals on the motion of somatic cells , bacteria , and other single or multiple - cell organisms @xcite .",
    "these chemicals diffuse in the environment of the cells and the corresponding concentration gradients are responsible for the movement of the cells .",
    "for example , bacteria find glucose by swimming towards regions of higher concentration of such food molecules in the environment @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they can also flee from poison ( such as phenol ) according to their local concentration .",
    "moreover , sperm can move towards the egg during fertilization , thanks to concentration gradients of aminoacids , in a ligand / receptor interaction .    the chemotactic ability of slime molds like _",
    "dictyostelium _ is responsible for starving amoebae to gather to form multicellular bodies @xcite . during most of their lives ,",
    "these slime molds are individual unicellular protists living in similar habitats and feeding on microorganisms . in the absence of food , however , they release signal molecules ( dif-1 , short for differentiation inducing factor ) into their environment , so that they can find other amoeba and create swarms . in other words ,",
    "when a chemical signal is secreted , they assemble into a cluster which acts as a single organism @xcite .    a model for nonlocal coupling mediated by a diffusing chemical",
    "was proposed by kuramoto , in which the equations governing the time evolution of the oscillators can be coupled by using the concentration of a substance which diffuses through the medium in which the oscillators are embedded @xcite . if the chemical diffuses in a timescale much faster than the oscillator period the coupling , although involves virtually all oscillators like in the global case , depends on the distance between oscillators in an exponentially decaying way @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used in studies of cell interaction @xcite and neural oscillators @xcite . in the latter",
    "example the chemical secreted and absorbed by the neurons is a neurotransmitter which mediates the coupling among neurons .",
    "this coupling , on its way , depends also on the dynamics of the individual neurons , since it determines the propagation of electrical impulses along neuronal circuits in the brain .",
    "this neuronal activity ( i.e. , the evolution of the action potential ) presents a fast timescale characterized by repetitive spiking and a slow timescale with bursting activity , where neuron activity alternates between a quiescent state and spiking trains @xcite .",
    "there are many models for this spiking - bursting behavior , comprising differential equations like the hindmarsch - rose model @xcite and discrete - time maps , as the rulkov map @xcite .",
    "an assembly of coupled bursting neurons exhibit many self - organized phenomena .",
    "we are particularly interested in bursting synchronization , for which the neurons burst at approximately the same time , even though their spiking behavior may be not synchronized itself @xcite .",
    "thanks to the slow timescale we may regard each bursting neuron as a phase oscillator , on defining a bursting phase and a corresponding frequency ( its time rate ) @xcite .    on the other hand , neurophysiologists argue that bursting synchronization plays a key role in some pathologies like parkinson s disease , essential tremor , and epilepsies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question of how to suppress this synchronization acquires a practical importance in terms of the control of undesirable neuronal rhythms .",
    "there have been proposed some alternatives to implement such a control through deep brain stimulation techniques .",
    "one of these is the addition of a time - periodic external signal of small amplitude and given frequency @xcite .",
    "we have considered such a scheme in scale - free networks @xcite and regular lattices with a power - law coupling @xcite .",
    "another deep brain stimulation technique was proposed by rosenblum and pikowsky , and consists of a time - delayed feedback signal applied to specific cortex areas @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied this technique in scale - free networks @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose to study the control of bursting synchronization in a neuronal network with a long - range coupling mediated by a diffusing substance , using the kuramoto model in the adiabatic limit of a rapidly diffusing chemical @xcite .",
    "we shall use a time - periodic external signal and a time - delayed feedback signal so as to suppress bursting synchronization whenever it occurs , and study this phenomenon from the point of view of our coupling model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we outline a model for long - range coupling intermediated by a diffusing substance . in section 3",
    "we particularize the model to one - dimensional oscillator chains and coupled map lattices . in section 4 we consider the bursting dynamics as described by the rulkov map , and a long - range coupled network of rulkov neurons . in section 5",
    "we investigate the bursting synchronization of coupled rulkov neurons according to the nonlocal coupling model .",
    "section 6 deals with the control of synchronized bursting rhythms by application of an external time - periodic driving and a delayed feedback signal .",
    "our conclusions are left to the last section .",
    "chemical coupling mediated by a diffusing substance can be mathematically described by a model proposed by kuramoto leading to nonlocal couplings @xcite . in this model",
    "the state variables of each oscillator influence the secretion of a chemical substance obeying a diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "the rate of absorption depends on the local concentration of this substance at each cell position . in the following",
    "we will deal with two classes of vectors , which are represented with a different notation : ( i ) positions @xmath2 in a @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space , to which the oscillators belong ; ( ii ) state variables @xmath4 in a @xmath5-dimensional phase space of the dynamical variables characterizing the state of the system at a given time @xmath6 .",
    "there are @xmath7 oscillator cells located at discrete positions @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , in the @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space ; and @xmath10 is the state variable for each oscillator , whose time evolution is governed by the vector field @xmath11 [ fig .",
    "[ chemfig ] ] .",
    "the oscillators are not supposed to be identical , though , for they can have slightly different parameters .",
    "we suppose that the time evolution is affected by the local concentration of a chemical , denoted as @xmath12 , through a time - dependent coupling function @xmath13 : @xmath14 whereas the chemical concentration satisfies a diffusion equation of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a small parameter representing the fact that diffusion occurs in a timescale faster than the intrinsic period of individual oscillators ; @xmath17 is a phenomenological damping parameter , and @xmath18 is a diffusion coefficient .",
    "the diffusion equation above has a source term @xmath19 which depends on the oscillator state at the discrete spatial positions @xmath8 : this means that each oscillator secrets the chemical with a rate depending on the current value of its own state variable .     schematic figure of spatially distributed phase oscillators.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    according to ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the diffusion is very fast , compared with the oscillator period , such that we may set @xmath20 .",
    "this makes the concentration of the mediating chemical to relax immediately to a stationary value that can be written in the following form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a green function ( or an interaction kernel ) , which is the solution of @xmath23    since we have eliminated adiabatically the concentration of the diffusing chemical , on substituting ( [ green ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ chem ] ) we can obtain an equation expressing the nonlocal coupling in the adiabatic approximation @xmath24    if @xmath13 is a linear function of @xmath10 ( but not necessarily of the positions @xmath8 ) we can write @xmath25 in such a way that we distinguish among some cases of interest : ( i ) the _ linear coupling _ , for which [ linear ] g(h(x_k ) ) = ax_k , where @xmath26 is a @xmath27 matrix indicating which variables of the oscillators are coupled ; ( ii ) the _ future coupling _ , where [ future ] g(h(x_k ) ) = af(x_k ) , and ( iii ) the _ nonlinear coupling _ , such that [ nonlinear ] g(h(x_k ) ) = ah(x_k ) , where @xmath28 is a nonlinear function of its arguments .",
    "the equation for linear coupling , for instance , is thus @xmath29 as an example , let us consider each cell as undergoing a time evolution governed by the hindmarch - rose equations @xcite , which also describe neurons with spiking and bursting activity .",
    "for this system we have @xmath30 and [ hr ] x = (    c x + y + z    ) , = (    c y + ax^2 - x^3 - z + i + 1 - bx^2 - y + r[s(x- ) - z ]    ) , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are model parameters .    coupling these equations through the @xmath37-variable amounts to choose [ a ] a = (    ccc & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) , where @xmath38 is the coupling strength ; such that the equation ( [ oscillinear ] ) for the linear coupling reads , in this case _ j & = & y_j + a x_j^2 - x_j^3 - z_j + i + _ k=1^n ( r_j - r_k ) x_k , + [ hmlinear ] y_j & = & 1 - b x_j^2 - y_j , ( j = 1 , 2 , ",

    "the corresponding equation for future coupling is obtained simply by changing @xmath10 by @xmath11 in ( [ oscillinear ] ) .    as an example of nonlinear coupling ,",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath40 , for which @xmath10 is a single phase @xmath41 , the vector function @xmath11 being the corresponding frequency @xmath42 ( different for each oscillator , in general ) .",
    "in this case @xmath26 reduces to a scalar coupling strength @xmath38 and we can choose as the nonlinear coupling function ( x_k ) = ( _ j - _ k ) , yielding a nonlinearly coupled kuramoto model @xcite [ kuramodel ] _",

    "the most elementary application of the model of nonlocal coupling mediated by a diffusing chemical is a one - dimensional regular lattice of @xmath7 ( an odd number ) fixed and equally spaced oscillators with non - local interactions given by the kernel ( [ sigma123 ] ) for @xmath51 . assuming that the distance between consecutive lattice sites is a constant @xmath52 , and supposing periodic boundary conditions @xmath53 we can write @xmath54 by changing the summation index from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 .",

    "it is instructive to explore the limiting cases of the nonlocal coupling .",
    "if @xmath1 goes to zero then , @xmath69 and we have a global type of coupling @xmath70 where each oscillator interacts with the mean field of all sites ( except itself ) @xmath71    in the limit of @xmath1 large , the exponentials in the green function decay very fast with the lattice distance @xmath59 , such that only the term with @xmath72 contributes significantly to the summations .",
    "this gives for the normalization constant [ cinf ] c and the coupling term takes into account effectively only the nearest neighbors of a given site [ oscil4 ] = f(x_j ) + ( x_j-1 + x_j+1 ) which is the usual local ( or laplacian ) coupling .",
    "in this and the forthcoming sections we present , as an application of nonlocally couplings mediated by a diffusing substance , a model of coupled bursting neurons . depending on the phenomena we are interested to investigate ,",
    "the mathematical description of biological neurons may require models ranging from dozens of complicated differential equations to simple integrate - and - fire one - dimensional models @xcite . in the following we are going to study collective phenomena involving the spiking and bursting activity of neurons , for which there is a slow bursting modulating the fast action - potential spiking .      since we are interested on finding the conditions for an assembly of neurons to burst synchronously , in particular the coupling parameters necessary to achieve this goal , the fine details of the neuron dynamics are not essential to the network model .",
    "hence , instead of continuous - time models like the hindmarch - rose model , which can be slower to simulate computationally , we choose to use discrete - time models instead , which are fast and reliable @xcite .    a simple model but which nevertheless presents all the essential behavior of bursting neurons is the rulkov map @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fast and @xmath75 is the slow dynamical variable .",
    "the first variable has a dynamical behavior emulating the spiking - bursting activity of a neuron , depending on the parameter @xmath76 , whereas the latter variable undergoes a slow evolution because of the small values taken on by the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which model the action of external dc bias current and synaptic inputs on a given isolated neuron @xcite .",

    "[ buster](a ) ] .",
    "the bursting timescale , on the other hand , comes about by the influence of the slow variable @xmath75 .",
    "this can be understood by using a simple argument : since , from eq .",
    "( [ rulkovx ] ) , @xmath75 represents a small input on the fast variable dynamics its effect can be approximated by a constant value @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional map , [ rulkovapr ] x_n+1 = + , can have either one , two , or three fixed points @xmath80 , depending on the value of the input @xmath84 .    as the latter approaches a critical value @xmath81 the fixed points @xmath85 ( one stable and another unstable ) undergo a saddle - node bifurcation , such that , for @xmath86 , however , the fixed points @xmath87 disappear [ fig . [ adic ] ] . for values of @xmath88",
    "there is also a chaotic attractor that , provided @xmath89 , coexists with the stable fixed point attractor .",
    "actually , at @xmath90 the chaotic attractor collides with the unstable fixed point @xmath91 and is destroyed through a boundary crisis [ fig .",
    "[ adic ] ] @xcite .",
    "the bursting regime then results from a hysteresis between the stable fixed point ( quiescent evolution ) and the chaotic oscillations ( fast sequence of spikes ) .",
    "time evolution of the ( a ) fast and ( b ) slow variables in the rulkov map ( [ rulkovx])-([rulkovy ] ) for @xmath79 , @xmath92 .",
    "we also indicate by @xmath93 the local maxima of the slow variable , used to obtain a phase for the bursting dynamics.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we consider a given burst to begin when the slow variable @xmath75 , which presents nearly regular saw - teeth oscillations , has a local maximum , in well - defined instants of time we call @xmath93 [ fig .",

    "we can define a phase describing the time evolution within each burst and varying from @xmath47 to @xmath94 as @xmath95 evolves from @xmath93 to @xmath96 : @xmath97    the duration of the chaotic burst , @xmath98 , depends on the variable @xmath74 and fluctuates in an irregular fashion when @xmath74 undergoes a chaotic evolution .",
    "there follows that the bursting phase rate also varies with time , such that we look at the bursting frequency defined by @xmath99      when the euclidean distance between neurons does not play a significant role , the corresponding networks may be treated from the graph - theoretical point of view . however , once we regard those neurons as embedded in a three - dimensional lattice ( the brain , where they are connected by axons and dendrites ) , it is convenient to use a lattice embedded in a euclidean space @xcite",
    ".    such higher - dimensional lattices can be very difficult to work with in terms of computer simulations , specially if long - range interactions are present and the number of neurons is large . however , good insights are expected to come from simpler models , which can nevertheless retain some of the general characteristics of higher - dimensional lattices .",
    "it is from this point of view that we use one - dimensional lattices with @xmath7 neurons , each of them being described by the rulkov map ( [ rulkovx]-[rulkovy ] ) .",
    "the main assumption we make is that the neurons are coupled through the release and absorption of a neurotransmitter , which is able to diffuse quickly in the medium in which the neurons are embedded .",
    "the release of the neurotransmitter is influenced by the fast dynamics , that is , once the action potential is spiking there are liberated neurotransmitter molecules in the cell environment .",
    "these molecules are then absorbed by other neurons and are supposed to affect their fast dynamics , making them to spike in a slightly different way .",
    "this would be certainly a rather crude model to describe information transmission through neuron cells , for it does not incorporate other features of neuron electrical and chemical coupling .",
    "however , this model , in spite of its simplicity , suffices to exemplify in which sense does a coupling mediated by a diffusing substance can affect coherent rhythms and other collective phenomena , what is potentially interesting for other applications , like chemotaxis .    the model of nonlocal coupling mediated by a diffusing substance , outlined in the previous section , can be straightforwardly translated to the language of coupled map lattices , for which both space and time are discrete .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath100 for the state variable vector at the site @xmath101 ( in a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions ) and time @xmath102 .",
    "the vector field @xmath103 specifies now the map equations , and the interpretation of the remaining variables is the same as for oscillator chains .",
    "the equation for linear coupling of maps becomes @xmath104 the future coupled map lattice being obtained by replacing @xmath105 by @xmath106 in the coupling term .",

    "the second technique is the use of a time - delayed feedback signal , with the same purpose .",
    "each control method has its advantages in terms of the efficiency of the suppression of synchronized bursting .",

    "a control scheme is ideally efficient when the variance of the controlled mean field vanish , irrespectively of its value without control , corresponding thus to an infinite value of @xmath138 . as a general rule",
    ", the larger is the value of @xmath138 , the more efficient will be the feedback on suppressing synchronization .",
    "we can adapt the map - based neural network model ( [ rmx])-([rmy ] ) so as to model the injection of a time - periodic electric signal of low amplitude .",
    "we have implemented this procedure by adding an external time - periodic signal to just one neuron @xmath139 ( the remaining neurons remaining unchanged ) .",

    "we remark that the time - periodic signal is applied only at the variable representing the fast ( @xmath37 ) neuron dynamics , since the slow ( @xmath39 ) variable modulates the chaotic activity of @xmath37 . for this to occur even when the neurons are coupled ,",

    "besides the possibility of bursting phase synchronization , as we dealt with in the previous section , we shall also be concerned with bursting frequency synchronization , which is a slightly weaker phenomenon since it demands that only the time - rate be equal for a number of neurons , even when their phases may differ .",

    "[ supressaodiferencial ] and [ supressaodireta ] we observe that the regions of moderate efficiency of the latter ( between the low efficiency domains ) have values of @xmath138 comparable with the domains of high efficiency of the differential control .",
    "however , as a whole there are more regions of high efficiency in the direct control than in differential one , the difference being that the high efficiency regions are spread out over the parameter plane in the direct feedback case .",
    "in many biological contexts the interaction between dynamically active cells is mediated by a chemical diffusing through the inter - cell medium .",
    "this is the case , for example , of neuron synaptical connections , which are accomplished through neurotransmitters .",
    "there are two timescales involved in this kind of situations , since the timescale of the cell oscillation is generally different from the timescale related to the diffusion process .",
    "hence a complete treatment of this kind of coupling would demand the simultaneous solution of the diffusion equation and the system of coupled oscillator equations .",
    "however , if the timescale related to the diffusion is much smaller than the characteristic oscillator periods we can make an adiabatic approximation and write down a closed - form expression for the nonlinearly coupled oscillator chain . for the one - dimensional case it results in a coupling term whose strength decreases with the lattice distance in an exponential fashion .",
    "an advantage of this procedure is that one can describe the commonly used global ( all - to - all ) and local ( nearest - neighbor ) cases as limiting forms of the nonlocal coupling , by varying the diffusion length that characterizes the exponential decay of interaction .    in this work we explored some of these features by using a simplified model for neuronal network consisting of map - based units displaying spiking - and - bursting behavior .",
    "although the spiking ( fast ) dynamics is chaotic , the bursting ( slow ) dynamics presents coherent features due to the neuron interaction , one of them being their capability of synchronize the beginning of the bursting regime .",
    "the transition to bursting synchronization was found to depend on the nonlocal coupling features . in particular , as the inverse coupling length @xmath1 is decreased it becomes more difficult to obtain synchronization , for a fixed coupling strength .",
    "this is compatible with the observation that locally coupled neurons are less amenable to exhibit such collective effects like bursting synchronization than globally coupled ones .",
    "this is particularly interesting from the point of view of potential disorders ( like abnormal rhythms associated with epilepsy and parkinson disease ) related to them . in order to control those undesirable bursting synchronized rhythms",
    "we have used two strategies for suppressing bursting synchronization : a time - periodic signal and a delayed feedback one . in the former procedure a time - periodic harmonic and low - intensity signal injected on a randomly chosen neuron .",
    "this external signal is capable to change the bursting frequencies of interacting neurons so as to drive them out of the synchronized behavior .",
    "the inclusion of a time - periodic signal causes the synchronized neurons to lock into an arnold - like tongue with a well - defined width .",
    "the common bursting frequency was found to increase with the inverse coupling length .",
    "moreover , the frequency locking tongues were found to be asymmetric with respect to this common locking frequency . as a consequence , if one injects an external signal with frequency higher than the upper limit of the frequency - locking tongue we can obtain desynchronization , as required .",
    "both the amplitude and the asymmetrical features of the tongues were found to depend on the nonlocal character of the interaction between neurons .    in terms of the efficiency of the bursting synchronization suppression",
    ", we did not find an appreciable effect of an external time - periodic signal of constant amplitude and frequency , even after wide changes in these parameters .",
    "accordingly , we sought for a non - constant scheme of control , preferably with an amplitude tailored to suit the actual needs of suppressing synchronized behavior .",
    "this was accomplished by the injection of a time - delayed feedback signal .",
    "in contrast with the previous control scheme , for this feedback signal we observed formation of suppression domains for time delays roughly centered at multiples of the bursting period , with a well - defined periodicity .    two feedback control types were used : a differential scheme , with a relative symmetry between domains of low and high suppression , and a direct scheme , with an apparent bias towards low suppression domains . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the direct scheme seems superior to both a time - periodic signal and a differential feedback signal in the sense that the suppression efficiency is higher over the control parameter plane , even though we do not observe many domains of control for this case .",
    "hence , from a `` practical '' point of view , a direct feedback delayed signal would yield better results in terms of the suppression of undesired ( and pathological ) synchronized rhythms .",
    "the extension of the present formalism to higher - dimensional lattices is quite straightforward , but the coupling kernel is somewhat different and the summation through all neighborhoods may become a computationally difficult task",
    ". however , the general features of such a kind of coupling are already present in the simpler one - dimensional case .",

    "<S> many networks of physical and biological interest are characterized by a long - range coupling mediated by a chemical which diffuses through a medium in which oscillators are embedded . </S>",
    "<S> we considered a one - dimensional model for this effect for which the diffusion is fast enough so as to be implemented through a coupling whose intensity decays exponentially with the lattice distance . in particular , we analyzed the bursting synchronization of neurons described by two timescales ( spiking and bursting activity ) , and coupled through such a long - range interaction network . </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of the model is that one can pass from a local ( laplacian ) type of coupling to a global ( all - to - all ) one by varying a single parameter in the interaction term . </S>",
    "<S> we characterized bursting synchronization using an order parameter which undergoes a transition as the coupling parameters are changed through a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the role of an external time - periodic signal on the bursting synchronization properties of the network . </S>",
    "<S> we show potential applications in the control of pathological rhythms in biological neural networks . </S>"
