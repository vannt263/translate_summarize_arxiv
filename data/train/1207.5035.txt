    "we demonstrate duality relations ( see definition [ dualdef ] ) for both of these systems directly from their markovian dynamics : @xmath0-tasep is dual to a totally asymmetric zero range process tazrp ( theorem [ thm : qtasepduality ] ) whereas asep is self dual ( theorems [ thm : asepdualitytilde ] and [ thm : asepduality ] ) .",

    "the case when @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) was proved earlier by johansson @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm13 ] also allows to access ( under a certain weakly asymmetric scaling ) the narrow wedge kpz equation one point formula @xcite .    for @xmath0-tasep",
    "such a mellin - barnes type formula was obtained from the theory of macdonald processes @xcite , theorem 4.1.40 .",
    "it should be possible to use this fredholm determinant to prove cube - root gue tracy - widom fluctuations for the current past the origin in @xmath0-tasep .",
    "this has not yet been done , though in an stationary version of the tazrp associated to @xmath0-tasep gaps , the cube - root fluctuation scale is shown in @xcite ( via a different approach ) . in @xcite the @xmath0-tasep mellin - barnes type fredholm determinant formula",
    "is used ( via a limit transition ) to write the laplace transform of the oconnell - yor semi discrete polymer partition function @xcite . then @xcite perform rigorous asymptotic analysis to show cube - root gue tracy - widom free energy fluctuations as well as to provide a second rigorous derivation of the narrow wedge kpz equation formula ( first rigorously derived in @xcite ) . from the perspective of asymptotics , this second approach is a little less involved than that of @xcite .    on the other hand , using the formulas of the second type ( i.e. deforming contours in theorems [ thm11 ] and [ thm12 ] differently ) we prove that the second generating function is equal to a fredholm determinant which we call _ cauchy _ type .",
    "the asep fredholm determinant tracy and widom derived in @xcite is also of this type ( and in fact , after inverting the @xmath63-laplace transform we recover the same formula as in @xcite ) .",
    "asymptotic analysis of this type of determinant is not as straightforward as the mellin - barnes type . in @xcite ,",
    "tracy and widom employ a significant amount of post - processing to turn this type of formula into one for which they could perform asymptotic analysis .",
    "the final formula still involves a complicated term related to the ramanujan summation formula ( as observed in @xcite ) .",
    "one should note that while we do recover ( among other formulas ) the tracy - widom asep fredholm determinant formula , our approach via duality is entirely different , our contour integral ansatz is not a version of the coordinate bethe ansatz and , along the way , we gain access to other information about asep , like joint moment formulas .",
    "the cauchy type fredholm determinant formula for @xmath0-tasep was also first derived in @xcite via macdonald processes .    in short , by utilizing duality for @xmath0-tasep and asep , we are able to provide a short and direct route from markov dynamics to fredholm determinant formulas characterizing single particle location or single integrated current distributions .    both @xmath0-tasep and asep are integrable discretizations of the kpz equation . as stochastic processes they converge to the hopf - cole solution to the kpz equation @xcite .",
    "the systems of odes associated with their duality appear ( though no exact results to this effect have yet been proved ) to have limit transitions to the attractive quantum delta bose gas which describes the evolution of joint moments of the stochastic heat equation ( whose logarithm is the kpz equation and which describes the partition function for the continuum random polymer ) .    an advanced version of the popular physics polymer replica trick attempts to recover the laplace transform of the one point distribution of the solution to the stochastic heat equation in terms of its moments ( see section [ sec : reptrick ] ) .",
    "however , the moments grow far too quickly to characterize this distribution and hence drawing conclusions from them is mathematically unjustifiable and in any case , risky .",
    "nevertheless , dotsenko @xcite and calabrese , le doussal and rosso @xcite were eventually able to use this trick to recover the exact formulas of @xcite .",
    "it was then natural to consider a discrete analog of this replica approach .",
    "the fact that duality gives a useful tool for computing the moments for asep was first noted in @xcite . by combining this observation with some of the calculational techniques developed in @xcite , in the present paper we provide a unified and complete scheme to study both @xmath0-tasep and asep .",
    "given the results of our work , the non - rigorous replica trick manipulations can be seen as shadows of the rigorous duality to determinant approach developed presently .",
    "that is to say that by going to a suitable discrete approximation we are able to rigorously recover analogs of laplace transforms from moments and then in the limit transition these converge to formulas for the stochastic heat equation s laplace transform .",
    "the replica trick has proved computationally useful ( see for instance @xcite ) , thus providing additional motivation for the present work .",
    "the limit transition of @xmath0-tasep to the oconnell - yor semi - discrete directed polymer @xcite ( and associated semi - discrete stochastic heat equation ) is explored in section [ sec : limtran ] . under that limit transition , duality becomes the replica approach and the duality system of odes become a semi - discrete version of the delta bose gas .",
    "the nested contour integral ansatz provides means to succinctly compute the solution to the bose gas .",
    "the fredholm determinants for @xmath0-tasep limit to fredholm determinants for the laplace transform of the polymer partition function .",
    "while a variety of probabilistic systems arise as degenerations of macdonald processes , asep is not known to be one of them . for asep",
    ", it is not known what , if anything , replaces this additional integrable structure endowed to @xmath0-tasep from its connection to symmetric functions .",
    "however , it is compelling that both @xmath0-tasep and asep have duality relations and that the associated systems of odes can both be solved via a nested contour integral ansatz",
    ". this leads one to ask whether @xmath0-tasep and asep can be unified via a theory even higher than macdonald processes .",
    "spohn @xcite has coined the term _ stochastic integrability _ to describe stochastic processes which display a great deal of integrable structure . perhaps , so as to avoid confusion with stochastic integrals , a more appropriate name for the present area of study is _ integrable sotchastich particle systems_. both @xmath0-tasep and asep are clear examples of such systems and the contributions of this work provide an additional layer to that integrability .",
    "an upcoming work @xcite introduces two discrete time variants of @xmath0-tasep and shows how the methods and ideas of the present paper extend to the study of these systems as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we prove duality for @xmath0-tasep and explicitly solve the associated systems of odes via a nested contour integral ansatz . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we provide a general scheme to go from such nested contour integral formulas to two types of fredholm determinants and in section [ sec : qtasepapp ] we apply this to @xmath0-tasep in order to prove theorem [ thm11 ] . in section [ sec4 ]",

    "one would need to control the tails of the integrand defining the kernel .",
