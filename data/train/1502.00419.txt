    "we will discuss this in detail in section vi when we treat the wetting problem within dpa . in this and the preceding two subsections",
    "we have disclosed that the dpa is useful for guessing exact results .",
    "we now turn to the precise definition of the dpa in the context of gp theory and to the study of the remarkable properties of the simple model defined through the dpa .",
    "the idea of approximating a double - well potential by a piece - wise parabolic function is old and generally dictated by the desire to work with piece - wise harmonic potentials that allow one to solve the equations of motion exactly using simple functions , the behavior of which is easy to interpret physically . in the context of surface and interfacial phenomena one of the first to implement this approximation for the bulk free - energy density",
    "was hauge @xcite .",
    "we follow this line of thought and expand the quartic potential @xmath67 in about its ( local ) minima , which correspond to the bulk values for the order parameters . for obtaining the interface profile in the half - space @xmath68",
    "we make use of the expansion about bulk condensate 2 and for the half - space @xmath69 we expand about condensate 1 , in the following manner ,    @xmath70    in which the real numbers @xmath71 and @xmath72 are treated as small perturbations .",
    "we expand the potential up to second order in @xmath73 and @xmath74 and so arrive at two  quadratic \" potentials , each of which is to be used in the appropriate half - space ,    @xmath75    this defines the dpa for the potential energy density and can be interpreted as the potential for a model that is related to , but different from , the original gp theory and which we will call the dpa model .",
    "the following technical remark is in order : in view of the structure of the tigpe we anticipate that , at the interface position @xmath45 , it will ( in general ) be possible to preserve continuity of the order parameter functions _ and _ their first derivatives . indeed , in view of , continuity of the potential @xmath67 but discontinuity of one of its ( partial ) derivatives with respect to the order parameter(s ) , at @xmath45 ,",
    "will induce a _ discontinuity in the second derivative _ of the interface profile functions @xmath76 ; @xmath77 .",
    "this is a mild singularity , often imperceptible to the eye in an interface plot .",
    "experience has taught us that this singularity has little or no effect on the qualitative features of the phenomena under study , provided one stays away from bulk criticality or similar conditions , at which the ( local ) minima of the potential may merge or undergo some other drastic change .",
    "the double - parabola - approximated gp equations are obtained by replacing the potential @xmath67 in the lagrangian density by the @xmath78 in and deriving the euler - lagrange equation , which leads to @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "note that , alternatively , these linearized equations can be obtained directly from the gp equations of by expanding the order parameters to first order in the perturbations about their bulk values , similarly to what was done in @xcite .",
    "for studying the interface structure , it would be sufficient to limit our attention to real order parameters and real perturbations . nevertheless , we insist on deriving the dpa in complex function space because we have the intention to apply our results in future work to dynamical properties such as dispersion of phonon excitations and capillary wave excitations using the bogoliubov - de gennes formalism .",
    "when the order parameters are stationary , namely @xmath81 , we obtain the dpa to the tigpe , @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "note that the dpa equations appear decoupled in the order parameters .",
    "however , the form of the equations depends on which bulk phase is chosen as starting point for the expansion . since the bulk boundary conditions are different on either side of the interface , the order parameters are implicitly coupled .",
    "of course , the apparent decoupling greatly facilitates analytical calculations .      for obtaining static interface profiles we can take all functions to be real , and independent of the coordinates @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( translational invariance in the directions parallel to the interface ) and independent of time .",
    "the solutions @xmath84 that solve the tigpe with the suitable boundary conditions are simple exponentials .",
    "a unique interface is obtained by matching the solutions for @xmath46 to the ones for @xmath47 at @xmath45 with the requirement that the functions and their first derivatives be continuous at @xmath45 .",
    "this leads to @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "this condition is @xmath100 when this condition is not satisfied , as can typically happen for weak segregation ( @xmath101 ) , a term quadratic in the penetrating condensate order parameter dominates a term of first order in the deviation of the penetrated condensate order parameter from its bulk value @xcite . under such circumstances it is recommended to go beyond the dpa as far as the computation of order parameter profiles is concerned .",
    "however , for energy and interfacial tension computations we find that including this nonlinear term brings only modest improvement over the interfacial tension calculated within our dpa model , when the result is compared with the ( numerically ) exact result in gp theory , even in the weak segregation regime .",
    "our strategy in this and forthcoming works is , and will be , to consider the dpa as a model in its own right , based on and defined by the specific potential energy density , and to explore its predictions . as a first example of this strategy we will , in the next section , calculate the interfacial tension within the dpa model and compare it with the interfacial tension within gp theory . as a second example we will , in section vi , apply the dpa model for the calculation of the wetting transition in adsorbed binary bec mixtures , and compare it with the wetting transition in gp theory .      in the limit of strong segregation @xmath53",

    "if we wish to consider the dpa solutions as trial functions wthin gp theory , we must use and may not use .",
    "doing so would lead to an approximation that is far less useful than our dpa model because , for example , it would lead to an interfacial tension that diverges in the limit @xmath121 , which is physically unacceptable .    in view of these considerations ,",

    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    incidentally , we note that the interfacial tension obtained for this exact solution @xmath172 is 2/3 of the value found within the dpa model for the same condensate parameters @xmath170 and @xmath173 .",
    "in this work we accomplished two goals : i ) we added an exact solution to the gp theory for interfaces in bec binary mixtures . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first exact solution for an asymmetric system ( with unequal healing lengths ) and at finite inter - species repulsion strength @xmath2 .",
    "we have been able to find this solution guided by information gathered by solving a simpler but related model , the so - called dpa .",
    "ii ) we defined and developed the  dpa model \" .",
    "we first derived the dpa for the potential energy density in the lagrangian by expanding the order parameters about their bulk values and keeping the deviations into account to second order . locating the interface center at @xmath45 , we next derived the dpa for the gp equations in each half - space , @xmath161 and @xmath157 .",
    "the solutions and their first derivatives were then matched at @xmath45 .",
    "this led to unique simple analytical solutions that can be used efficiently to uncover and understand properties of gp theory .",
    "the power of the dpa model lies in its capacity to provide systematically analytical expressions for many physical quantities of two segregated becs .",
    "we know of no other methods capable of doing this . here , the excess surface energies at a hard wall and at the interface were evaluated within the dpa model .",
    "this provided a compact and useful expression for the interfacial tension .",
    "as an application we derived the wetting phase boundary within dpa and obtained good agreement with the gp solution . moreover , the dpa provided crucial hints facilitating a successful guess of an exact solution to the gp equations for an asymmetric case @xmath174 . clearly , the dpa model is a practical and broadly applicable tool for exploring the physics of a more complicated model . in the future",
    "we plan to use the dpa frame - work to derive , and to get physical insight in , an approximate dispersion relation for capillary waves on the interface , which takes into account the finite thickness and the structure of the interface .",
