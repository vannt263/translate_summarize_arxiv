    "organometal halide perovskite @xmath1 semiconductors have attracted great interest since their incorporation into the field of photovoltaics @xcite .",
    "exceptional performance of @xmath2 percent power conversion efficiency @xcite is associated with the efficient light absorption and large electron - hole diffusion lengths @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . however , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , an ordinary excitonic picture does not explain the existence of the large electron - hole diffusion lengths in perovskite semiconductors @xcite at room temperature .",
    "the main reason is that an estimate electron - hole coupling energy ( @xmath3 ) , based on electro - optical properties of a perovskite solar cell , is small compared to the room thermal energy ( @xmath4 ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a thermal recombination time is very small at room temperature and it is impossible to have a standard exciton transport in a single perovskite .    in this letter we show that the experimental observed large transport lengths in perovskite solar cells @xcite that include an absorbing semiconductor as well as charge carrier transporting layers can be explained by involving the _ spatially indirect _ excitons ( a coupled system of electron and hole that are trapped in different parallel planes , separated by some distance ( see fig.1 ) ) . note ,",
    "that although the binding energy of the indirect exciton in the single perovskite semiconductor is even smaller than the ordinary exciton s binding energy , however , it can be significantly larger for the geometry depicted in fig .",
    "1 . indeed ,",
    "if electron ( hole ) and hole ( electron ) get close to each other in space and at the same time belong to different layers , then significantly small static dielectric permittivity of the @xmath0 transporting layer ( @xmath5 ) and its thickness ( @xmath6 ) seems to be crucially important components for the formation of the indirect excitons . in this plausible scenario ,",
    "the separation of electrons and holes in the direction perpendicular to the interface perovskite/@xmath0 heterojunction ( the growth direction ) reduces the wave function overlap , resulting in an increased exitons lifetime .",
    "we will come back to this point later in more detail .",
    "the realization of cold exciton gas in separated layers was proposed by one of the authors ( lozovik ) with yudson in ref .",
    "the indirect exciton model exhibits some similarities to a persistent current and the quasi - josephson phenomena .",
    "because of this , it is not surprising that during the past two to three decades many theoretical and experimental papers where devoted to systems with indirect excitons ( for a recent review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , most of these systems were considered only at low helium temperatures ( see , however ref .",
    "following refs . @xcite , the hamiltonian of an electron - hole pair in a perovskite/@xmath0 heterojunction structure , presented in fig .",
    "1 , can be recast into two - dimensional indirect exciton system , where electrons and holes are confined to different quantum wells and moved only parallel to the interface .",
    "this indirect exiton system can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two dimensional radius vectors of electron and hole , respectively . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are their effective masses , @xmath12 is the distance between electron and hole quantum wells , @xmath13 is the static effective dielectric permittivity of the system and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the random field of impurities seen by an electron ( hole ) along its movement path . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants that depend upon the band structure , impurity concentration and etc .",
    "it is worth noticing that although the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) does not contain any term describing the perovskite/@xmath0 interface , its existence is implied . as it follows from the energy diagram ( see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) the electron transporting layer @xmath0 at the same time plays a role of barrier for holes due to the large difference between valence band energy values in perovskite and in @xmath0 .",
    "this barrier hampers the penetration of the holes into @xmath0 forming a spatial separation of electrons and holes . according to this scenario",
    ", the electrons will remain in @xmath0 and holes in perovskite creating the indirect exiton states in two coupled quantum wells .",
    "the electron - hole pair moves parallel to the interface in these wells .",
    "one of the main characteristic features of the perovskite semiconductors used in solar cell elements is that the mentioned impurities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are point - like potentials .",
    "they create shallow states either at the bottom ( top of the valence band ) or at the top ( bottom of the conduction band ) of the band gap @xcite . following this observation the field of impurities in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "can be modeled as a gaussian distributed @xmath18-correlated random function @xmath19 as was previously mentioned , formation of the exciton within a single perovskite film at room temperatures is impossible because of the large value of the static dielectric permittivity ( @xmath20 ) and corresponding small value of exciton binding energy ( compared to @xmath4 ) .    however , the formation of spatially indirect excitons is a feasible approach in the perovskite/@xmath0 heterostructure , depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the transporting layer @xmath0 that is necessary in solar cells can serve simultaneously as a reservoir of electrons and as an opaque barrier for holes .",
    "the bulk perovskite provides holes at the contact interface ( see fig.1 ) , forming bounded couples with the electrons in @xmath0 .",
    "the latter has a relatively low static dielectric constant ( @xmath21 ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and an estimated effective electron s mass equal to 10 of free electron masses ( see , for example ref.@xcite ) . due to the separation between electron and hole layers ( typically 10 nm ) the average transport time of a bounded couple is at least @xmath22 times longer than the single charge carrier transport time .",
    "the latter leads to the large electron - hole diffusion lengths ( see below for the details ) .",
    "this implies that one deals eventually with an indirect exciton .",
    "it is convenient in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) to use relative and center of mass coordinates instead of electron and hole coordinates : @xmath23 , @xmath24 . as a result",
    "the center of mass moves in an effectively random field with a correlation function that is determined by the relative motion wave function , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correlation function for the indirect exciton in the two dimensional case has a form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radius of the indirect exciton and @xmath27 is the two dimensional excitonic bohr radius at @xmath28 .",
    "the reduced mass @xmath29 of an electron and a hole system approximately equals to @xmath11 , provided that @xmath30 and assuming that @xmath31 , i.e. there are no defects in @xmath0 .",
    "note that the correlation radius of the effective field acting on the exciton is proportional to the electron and hole motion planes distance , which is essentially larger than the bohr radius .",
    "the next step , using the explicit form of the correlation function ( [ twocorr ] ) , is to estimate the transport time of an indirect exciton in the perovskite/@xmath0 heterostructure .",
    "we recall that the transport time of a particle moving in a correlated random field can be determined by ( see , for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 means averaging over the scattering angles .",
    "@xmath34 is the fourier transform of correlation function at the transferred momentum and @xmath35 is the density of states that in the weak scattering regime and in the two dimensional case will become particle and energy independent , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "calculating explicitly the fourier transform of the correlation function b(r ) , eq .",
    "( [ twocorr ] ) , we find @xmath37 , \\label{furtrans}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the particle momentum .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ furtrans ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ trtime ] ) and taking the integral over the angle for the transport time in the limit @xmath39 , one gets @xmath40 this is our main result . despite that this is only an approximate expression , it correctly predicts a tendency for an increasing transport time and the diffusion lengths in perovskite/@xmath0 systems . indeed , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ trtimefin ] ) , the time of the coupled exciton compared to a single particle s transport time ( @xmath41 ) is proportional to the large parameter @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account that the radius of the indirect exciton @xmath43 , one obtains that the transport time is @xmath44 and thus strongly depends on @xmath0 film @xmath12 thickness .",
    "the latter plays a role of distance between the electron and hole quantum wells in a spatially indirect exciton scenario .",
    "the large factor @xmath42 will be shown to lead to : ( i ) a corresponding gain in exciton transport mean free path , which in the single particle and point - like scatterer case could be estimated to be of the order of the average distance between scatterers , ( ii ) and a large diffusion length in perovskite solar cell systems @xcite .",
    "let us now estimate the gain factor taking into account more realistic parameters , based on refs.@xcite .",
    "the exciton momentum @xmath38 is estimated as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the indirect exciton radius @xmath48 can be obtained taking @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the bohr radius and the reduced mass @xmath51 . assuming @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ", one has @xmath54 and for a lower bound of the two dimensional exciton radius @xmath55 about @xmath56 .",
    "however , @xmath55 will increase if the effective hole mass will be lighter than @xmath57 ( see ref.@xcite ) . using the above mentioned numbers",
    "one obtains @xmath58 . for @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "we have for the indirect exciton binding energy @xmath59 .",
    "this energy is larger than @xmath60 and manifests itself such that at room temperature indirect excitons can be treated as metastable particles .",
    "finally , the same factor @xmath42 will lead to the corresponding increase in exciton s two dimensional diffusion coefficient @xmath61 and hence affects the indirect exciton diffusion length @xmath62 .",
    "let us estimate the latter for a characteristic carrier recombination time @xmath63 ( see ref .",
    "the transport mean free path @xmath64 can be estimated as @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the average distance between two dimensional point - like scatterers and @xmath67 is the bulk concentration of impurities ) .",
    "velocity is estimated as @xmath68 , where kinetic energy @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the effective mass of the exciton that is determined mainly by the effective electron mass in @xmath0 . assuming a typical value for impurity concentration @xmath71 (",
    "see for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the exciton diffusion length we finally obtain @xmath72 .",
    "one can obtain even larger diffusion lengths by considering longer recombination times ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) or lower impurity concentrations as can happen in single perovskite crystals @xcite . furthermore",
    ", the exciton - induced factor @xmath42 in transport time correspondingly will lead to increase of the charge carriers mobilities , experimentally found in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that the two dimensional transport as a key of solar cell high performance was mentioned also in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "here we consider the formation of the indirect exciton between an electron from transporting layer ( @xmath0 ) and a hole from perovskite . in an analogous manner one can consider the indirect exciton formed by the electron from perovskite and the hole from the transporting layer .",
    "note , that the carrier diffusion lengths for perovskite without transporting layers are essentially small @xcite , at least by factor @xmath73 .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the transport mean free path and experimentally observed large diffusion length of charged carriers in perovskite/@xmath0 heterojunctions .",
    "it has been argued that a non - trivial large diffusion lengths of charge carriers in perovskite/@xmath0 system can be explained by involving the spatially indirect excitons ( a coupled system of electron and hole that are trapped in different parallel planes , separated by some distance ( see fig.1 ) ) .",
    "the indirect excitons can be treated as metastable particles because their binding energy ( @xmath74 ) is larger than thermal energy ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we have provided an analytical expression for the transport time , eq .",
    "( [ trtimefin ] ) , that correctly predicts a tendency for an increasing transport time and the diffusion lengths @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) in perovskite/@xmath0 systems .",
