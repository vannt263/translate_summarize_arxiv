    "the ongoing discovery of exoplanets is providing a wealth of opportunities to test models of planetary system formation , and has already revealed that our own solar system is not necessarily typical ( see @xcite for a review ) . due to the natural biases of radial velocity and transit detection methods a major focus has been on short period planets , of all ages .",
    "direct imaging efforts are biased oppositely , towards the detection of long period , young , and massive planets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "microlensing searches are also sensitive to longer period objects , independent of system age ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "recent direct imaging efforts have yielded constraints on the likelihood of certain classes of long period gas - giant planets @xcite , together with a number of increasingly robust claims of detection of long period planets , or sub - stellar companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and in particular @xcite and @xcite . these objects have projected separations of @xmath3 to a few 100 au .",
    "the result of @xcite ( ljvk08 ) is interesting , since it claims detection of an @xmath4 m@xmath5 object at apparent separation of 330 au from the parent star ( 1rxs j160929.1 - 210524 ) - an approximately solar - mass star in the young ( @xmath6 myr ) upper scorpius association .",
    "taken at face value this represents one positive detection out of @xmath7 potential planet hosting stars , or a detection rate of @xmath8% - although clearly this is a very crude evaluation since the detectability of companions is a complex function varying from star to star .",
    "most protostellar / proto - planetary disks are approximately 100 au in radius , and core accretion models predict giant planet formation close to the water - ice snowline ( @xmath9 au ) , where coalescence timescales are close to , or within , the disk lifetime against photoevaporation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational instability models @xcite might have a higher probability of forming massive planets at large radii - but this would require quite unusually massive and extended disks . as pointed out by ljvk08 , this suggests that migration and/or scattering mechanisms might be necessary to explain a planet at projected separation of 330 au .",
    "another possibility is that highly mass - imbalanced wide binary systems could form , with stellar and sub - stellar companions .    in this letter we present the results of numerical simulations of ensembles of 100 planetary systems that capture the effect of strong dynamical evolution through planet - planet scattering .",
    "we present a number of proof - of - principle predictions for objects with large semi - major orbital axes ( @xmath10 au ) , in particular those in young systems .",
    "our methodology stems primarily from the work of @xcite , and other investigations of dynamical effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite suggest that , for the purposes of studying dynamical evolution , planet formation may be simplified into two stages .",
    "the initial episode ( stage 1 ) involves the assembly and evolution of a circumstellar and proto - planetary disk over @xmath11 years . during stage 1 , planetary embryos",
    "are formed , destroyed , and interact strongly with their disk surroundings .",
    "stage 2 takes place once the major part of the gaseous proto - planetary disk has dissipated .",
    "it involves the dynamical evolution of any planets that remain , including collisions , mergers , scattering , and significant planet ejection from the systems over the following tens to hundreds of millions of years . using large ensembles of statistically identical initial conditions for planetary systems",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , in quite general circumstances , aspects of the observed distribution of _ giant _ exoplanet orbital eccentricities can be reproduced .",
    "this result is not strongly dependent on initial conditions as long as systems are dynamically active , or partially active .",
    "it also demonstrates the utility of studying the _ statistical dynamical _ properties of a population of planetary systems , rather than trying to identify a physical process that prescribes orbital characteristics in any single system .",
    "planets in dynamically active systems experience strong mutual interactions and frequent encounters and undergo relaxation .",
    "this typically occurs when the spacing relative to the mutual hill radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is small .",
    "partially active systems contain only a subset of objects undergoing strong and frequent interactions , and while _ inactive _ systems still evolve , there are typically few or no major encounters in this case . both active and partially active systems",
    "tend to lose planets as a function of time ( instability timescales are given by @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs through collisions ( and mergers ) , capture by the parent star , or very often through complete ejection from the system .",
    "thus , the stage 2 dynamical paradigm predicts _ both _ a large population of ejected planets and a systematic excess of planets in very young systems compared to older systems .",
    "we employ the publicly available n - body integration routines in the mercury6 package @xcite to follow the dynamical evolution of statistically identical ensembles of planetary systems .",
    "mercury6 also allows for close encounters and fully inelastic ( no fragmentation ) star - planet or planet - planet collisional mergers .",
    "we have found that a high - accuracy burlisch - stoer integrator typically provides relative energy errors of less than @xmath12 up to integration times of @xmath13 years for the systems we are modeling . for simplicity",
    "we therefore use the burlisch - stoer bs2 integrator in mercury6 and restrict our integrations to @xmath13 years - commensurate with the ages of the young planetary systems we hope to place constraints upon .",
    "our methodology is otherwise similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we note that for dynamically active systems all but the final @xmath14% of planet ejection / loss events have occurred by @xmath13 years .",
    "our simulations do not include the effects of tidal dissipation between planetary objects and the parent star .",
    "dissipation due to star - planet tides can act to dampen orbital eccentricities , and is an important physical process for planets with short periods .",
    "we choose to circumvent these issues by ignoring planets with semi - major axes of less than 0.1 au in our final results .",
    "this is well motivated in that tidal damping is expected to operate on timescales ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 years for objects with @xmath3 day orbital periods around solar mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we adopt a ( somewhat arbitrary ) physical ejection radius of 2000 au , but note that for semi - major axes beyond @xmath17 au , secular effects from galactic tides may become important ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that these tides would cause some of the planets we label as ejected to remain on bound orbits at very large separations .",
    "we neglect this possibility altogether in the present study .",
    "we perform two sets of runs , each with statistical ensembles of 100 systems .",
    "we populate the systems with 10 planets and adopt initial properties such that the systems are dynamically active .",
    "masses are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution in @xmath18 and are limited to a range of 0.1 - 10 m@xmath5 .",
    "initial orbital inclinations ( @xmath19 ) for all runs are drawn randomly from a rayleigh ( schwarschild ) distribution - where the peak , or mode , is equal to the distribution width parameter @xmath20 , and we set @xmath21 degrees .",
    "orbital eccentricities are also drawn from a rayleigh distribution with @xmath22 . in one run ,",
    "that we denote as @xmath23 , the initial semi - major axes are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution in @xmath24 between 0.1 au and 30 au . in the second run , denoted as @xmath25 , the outer truncation is increased to 100 au .",
    "all systems contain a central stellar mass of @xmath26m@xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath25 runs illustrate as simply as possible the dependence on initial conditions of the dynamical relaxation process .",
    "the two leading scenarios for planet formation , core accretion and direct gravitational collapse , should lead to significantly different initial orbital outcomes for young planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each of these scenarios faces challenges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they could in principle both operate in individual systems or in the proto - planetary population as a whole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given these complications , what is important in the present context is that the late dynamical architecture of exoplanetary systems could potentially allow us to discriminate between competing formation scenarios .",
    "specifically , formation via core accretion is favored in the vicinity of the snow - line in the proto - planetary disk , typically well within a few tens of au , while gravitational collapse is favored at larger orbital distances .",
    "this is the primary motivation for the two types of runs @xmath23 and @xmath25 performed here .      in order to model apparent separations of planet - star systems from our simulation outputs",
    "we must take into account the orbital characteristics and potential orientation of systems relative to a hypothetical observer .",
    "we adopt a simple algorithmic approach .",
    "first , the semi - major axis , eccentricity , and orbital period are used to construct a probability distribution for the instantaneous radial star - planet distance , assuming an observation made at a random time during the orbital period .",
    "we then assume that the orbital plane is randomly orientated with respect to the observer and project the star - planet radial separation onto the sky to obtain an apparent separation .",
    "we can draw an arbitrary number of  snapshot \" projections for all remaining bound planets in our simulations . since this step is not computationally intensive , the actual number of snapshots is simply determined by the need to adequately populate the mass  projected separation plane . here",
    "we generate 1000 such projections per individual planet , irrespective of any other bound planet in the system . for simplicity",
    ", we then generate a cumulative distribution of projected separations for all individual planets , ignoring entirely conditional probabilities associated with multiple planetary systems .",
    "this is sufficient for our present purpose , focused on the apparently most distant planet , but a more careful analysis would clearly require conditional probabilities for projected separations to be accounted for .    uncertainties in the separation distributions are estimated from the dominant poisson statistics of the original simulations with a total of only @xmath28 statistically - identical planets , as opposed to the more numerous projection realizations . for instance , if @xmath29 uniquely tagged planets , out of the total @xmath30 original ones , contribute to the statistics beyond some fixed projected separation , an uncertainty @xmath31 is applied to the apparent separation distribution .",
    "plotted error bars / envelopes are @xmath32 .",
    "in figure 1 we plot the mean number of planets per system as a function of time for the two runs @xmath23 and @xmath25 .",
    "the more closely packed planets in @xmath23 result in a faster decay , and by @xmath13 years , when both runs are much more dynamically relaxed , the mean number of remaining planets in @xmath23 is slightly lower than that in @xmath25 , with @xmath33 planets per system in both cases .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those of @xcite , who demonstrated that integrating to @xmath34 years ( by employing a symplectic integrator ) results in only moderate further evolution , owing to the loss already of an average 80% of the initial population by @xmath13 years .    by @xmath13 years in run",
    "@xmath23 , 25% of the initial population have collided with the central star , 12% undergo collision and merger with other planets and 44% are ejected ( the majority by scattering into an unbound @xmath35 orbit , some by passing beyond 2000 au , see below ) . for",
    "@xmath25 21% collide with the central star , 11% undergo collision and merger , and 44% are ejected .",
    "this indicates that the primary difference in final planet numbers at @xmath13 years between @xmath23 and @xmath25 is almost entirely due to the higher rate of collision with the central star in @xmath23 .    in figure 2 the eccentricity versus semi - major axis",
    "is plotted for all objects at several timeslices for the @xmath25 run to illustrate the orbital evolution of the population . in the first @xmath36 years a significant number of objects are scattered onto high eccentricity and large semi - major axis orbits .",
    "the great majority ( @xmath37% ) of objects that reach eccentricities @xmath38 become unbound ( @xmath35 ) due to scattering close to periastron .    in figure 3",
    "we plot the cumulative number of planets beyond a given apparent separation . in both @xmath23 and @xmath25",
    "runs , some outward diffusion of the planet population is clearly seen by comparison to the initial distribution .",
    "cumulative distributions after @xmath39 and @xmath13 years are shown , and only modest evolution is seen at these late times . in both runs , there is some reduction in the fraction of objects between a few au and @xmath40 au , from @xmath39 to @xmath13 years .    for comparison with the putative planet detection of ljvk08 , we find that the population of planets with 330 au apparent separation or greater in the @xmath25 run is @xmath41% with a variation of only @xmath42 between @xmath39 and @xmath13 years . in the @xmath23 run ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are @xmath43% at @xmath39 years and",
    "@xmath44% at @xmath13 years .",
    "we note that these results are broadly consistent with @xcite who find that @xmath45% of dynamically evolved ( scattered ) systems at late times ( @xmath46 years ) could still harbor a long - term stable planet with @xmath47 and @xmath48 au .    for a minimum apparent separation of 100 au , at @xmath39 years ,",
    "these fractions increase to @xmath49% in the @xmath25 runs and @xmath50% in the @xmath23 runs .",
    "later , at @xmath13 years , there is little evolution in the @xmath25 results , but a drop to @xmath51% in the @xmath23 results .",
    "although these numbers are not suitable for a direct comparison to current imaging survey constraints , we nonetheless note that the constraint of @xcite that less than 20% of systems should harbor @xmath52m@xmath5 planets between 20 and 100 au is broadly consistent with the results of our simulations .",
    "the @xmath23 runs indicate that less than @xmath53% of planets of all masses would be expected at larger than 20 au apparent separations ( at @xmath13 years ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath25 result is less than @xmath54% .",
    "the results shown in figure 3 do not discriminate between planets of different masses as a function of projected separation .",
    "this is a particularly important issue for direct imaging surveys , with yields depending on a combination of ages , masses and projected separations .",
    "we believe that a larger number of statistical realizations than performed here is needed to address this point reliably and postpone a more detailed investigation to future work .",
    "dynamical relaxation of young planetary systems can produce a population of long period planets within @xmath55 years of planet formation .",
    "the results presented here are subject to a number of limitations .",
    "although the outcome of dynamical relaxation of active systems in terms of eccentricities is not strongly dependent on the initial conditions set during stage 1 planet formation @xcite , the precise relationship between other population characteristics at @xmath56 years in stage 2 and initial parameters needs further exploration . for example , the differences between our @xmath23 and @xmath25 runs indicate that information on semi - major axis distributions is indeed retained in the population of objects at later times .",
    "the population of long period planets could therefore potentially provide important constraints on the outcome of stage 1 planet formation .",
    "furthermore , to make meaningful comparisons with observational surveys , one must allow for at least two biases : 1 ) not all stars surveyed will necessarily form a population of giant planets during stage 1 .",
    "2 ) not all systems with giant planets will be dynamically active at the start of stage 2 .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimate on the basis of the observed distribution of exoplanet eccentricities that perhaps 75% of currently known planetary systems have been dynamically active .",
    "less dynamically active systems , which were not directly addressed here , may provide better records of the planet formation outcome but at the expense of a smaller range of projected separations ( with respect to the dynamically relaxed apparent separations shown in fig .",
    "the detailed strategy of an imaging survey is also important for making meaningful comparisons with theoretical expectations . if the planet formation phase ( stage 1 ) lasts between @xmath39 and @xmath13 years , the timescale for disk dispersal / evaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then a  blind \" survey of young stars - where the target objects span a wide range of ages up to a few @xmath13 years - may not be well suited to probe the earliest stage 2 phase .",
    "indeed , the fast ( stage 2 ) relaxation phase ( figure 1 ) , relative to a longer duration stage 1 gaseous phase , suggests that it may be statistically difficult to identify the systematically larger number of planets expected in younger , dynamically - active proto - planetary systems . on the other hand , @xcite present evolutionary scenarios based on mean - motion resonance locking and remnant planetisimal disk evolution in which the transition from stage 1 to the stage 2 relaxation occur much more gradually . finding a larger number of planets in younger systems would provide strong observational evidence in support of the dynamical relaxation scenario .",
    "we conclude that the detection of massive planets at apparent separations of a few 100 au need not be a challenge to the core accretion model of planet formation if dynamical relaxation occurs through extensive planet - planet scattering .",
    "furthermore , the number of very long period planets resulting from scattering during the first few myrs following disk dispersal may be consistent with current upper limits , and claimed detections , from all existing planet imaging campaigns .",
    "these are encouraging but very preliminary results .",
    "they suggest that a more systematic exploration of dynamical relaxation outcomes for long - period planets , as a function of initial conditions and system age , could provide a valuable additional means to interpret the existing and future yields of direct imaging surveys . furthermore ,",
    "since microlensing surveys probe the same projected planetary separations , but typically at much later system ages , they provide very useful complimentary information on the late stages of the dynamical relaxation process .",
    "together such data would allow consistency checks to be performed on the systematic trends expected between early and late stages of orbital evolution in this promising model .",
