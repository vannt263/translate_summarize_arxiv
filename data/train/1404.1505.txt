    "assur decompositions of mechanisms dates back to the work of the engineer leonid assur @xcite as a tool to simplify the analysis and synthesis of mechanisms .",
    "these techniques are widely used in the kinematical community .",
    "several recent mathematical papers have reworked this approach using tools from rigidity theory , extending results from the plane to 3-space ( as well as higher @xmath0-dimensional space ) and providing algorithms for decomposing pinned isostatic frameworks into these minimal components @xcite .",
    "other recent papers have developed mathematical tools and algorithms to analyze the behaviour of symmetric frameworks @xcite . given the examples of symmetric mechanisms , with fully symmetric motions ,",
    "it is natural to consider how the symmetry - adapted tools can be used to decompose symmetric mechanisms for analysis , for synthesis and for control of these mechanisms .",
    "figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] shows two common mechanisms . the stewart platform of figure  [ fig : mechanisms](a , b , c ) is a pinned isostatic structure which is widely studied in mechanical engineering and robotics , and has appeared in previous papers on symmetry and rigidity @xcite .",
    "the symmetry analysis adds further information about when coordinated drivers give a fully symmetric motion .",
    "the grab bucket ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p270 ) ) depicted in figure  [ fig : mechanisms](d ) is a common machine which can be analyzed as a plane structure ( see section [ sec : variants ] ) ; this structure is pinned with mirror symmetry and does not fit the previous work on assur decompositions of plane mechanisms @xcite .",
    "we will apply the techniques developed for isostatic pinned graphs ( which generate square matrices ) to orbit rigidity matrices which have independent rows and maximal rank among symmetry regular configurations . consider the pinned framework in figure  [ fig : twomirror3d1](a ) .",
    "although this has the graph of a generically rigid framework in 3-space , with the symmetry of the two mirrors , generating a dihedral symmetry group , the inner points not on the ground all move continuously , preserving this symmetry ( b ) . in mechanical engineering , one can ask which drivers ( say pistons ) can be inserted to control this motion .",
    "figure  [ fig : twomirror3d1](c ) shows one set of drivers which , if they expand in a synchronized way , drive the framework along the path of the symmetric motion .",
    "the graph of this extended framework , or symmetric scheme , is generically redundant , but in the symmetry analysis of the associated orbit matrix , this is minimally rigid for symmetric motions , or -isostatic .    in our context , given a symmetry group , we can consider a framework which is minimally rigid for symmetric motions or _ pinned -isostatic _ ( figures  [ fig : mechanisms ] , [ fig : twomirror3d1](c ) , [ fig : desargues](a ) ) .",
    "graphs which are minimal pinned -isostatic will be called _",
    "-assur_. selecting any orbit of edges ( i.e. each edge together with all its symmetric copies ) under the action of the symmetry group as coordinated drivers will now generate a symmetric motion .",
    "there is a residual question whether this is the only residual motion - and we will return to such questions below .",
    "overall , the paper extends the basic techniques of assur decompositions , and the impact of selected drivers to a new context , whenever the associated pinned orbit matrix is square and full rank .",
    "this analysis confirms that , if the underlying graph is also pinned isostatic , we get the equivalent assur decomposition to an analysis on the underlying graph , confirming how symmetric orbits of drivers can drive symmetric motions .",
    "the symmetry analysis is simpler , because the group - labeled quotient graph ( also called gain graph ) and the resulting algebra of the orbit matrix are smaller .",
    "the symmetry based analysis also extends other structures where the underlying graph is not pinned isostatic , extending the insight of assur decompositions to new mechanisms and posing some new possibilities for synthesis of mechanisms with symmetric motions .",
    "we finish the introduction by outlining the paper .    * in section [ sec : back ] we review the key concepts and definitions on pinned frameworks , assur graphs and symmetric frameworks . * in section [ sec : pinsymfw ] we develop combinatorial conditions on the pinned -gain graph that ensure -isostaticity . * in section [ sec : sassur ] we consider the broad class of ` pinned -isostatic graphs ' . with this square invertible",
    "pinned orbit matrix , we are guaranteed an appropriate set of directions on the edges , of out - degree equal to the number of columns of that vertex in this pinned orbit matrix .",
    "any such -directed orientation gives a strongly - connected directed graph decomposition , and the components , along with their outgoing edges , are the -assur graphs .",
    "* section [ sec : isostatic ] examines the special subclass where the underlying graph is also generically isostatic , and remains isostatic at some ( almost all ) -regular configurations .",
    "this extra assumption allows us to map between the @xmath0-assur decomposition and the -assur decomposition . *",
    "section [ sec : variants ] examines examples of other types of pinned -isostatic frameworks where the underlying graph is not pinned isostatic , but redundant and rigid or is flexible . in those cases ,",
    "only the -assur decomposition is possible , and this new decomposition of the underlying graph provides additional insight for analysis and synthesis . * in the final two sections we consider inductive constructions for -assur graphs ( section [ sec : inductions ] ) and outline some extensions of our work based on the philosophy of applying the decomposition techniques to constraint systems that generate square matrices ( section [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",

    "is to generate a @xmath0-directed graph of @xmath2 ( for instance via the pebble game @xcite ) , where edges are directed toward the ground .",
    "the @xmath0-directed graph is then decomposed into its strongly connected components ( i.e. maximally strongly connected subgraphs ) @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a _ strongly connected component decomposition _ of a pinned @xmath0-directed graph of @xmath2 condenses all pins into a sink ( ground ) vertex , identifies the strongly connected components and condenses each such component to single vertices to obtain a directed acyclic graph and a partial order .",
    "note if any multiple edges arise during this identification process we discard additional copies .",
    "in @xcite it was noted that if there are two orientations of a graph in which corresponding vertices have the same out - degree then the two directed graphs differ at most by reversing orientations of cycles .",

    "hence it is harder to track the directions on these new edges and preserve the -orientation . when that is possible similar case by case analysis will reveal the effect of the operation on the components of a -assur decomposition .",

    "we can repeat lemma [ lem:1ext ] , with many more cases , to control exactly when a @xmath36-dimensional 1-extension preserves components or reduces the number of components , etc .",

    "the quantity dim@xmath347 is either @xmath348 so by choosing @xmath0-dimensional 1-extensions for the appropriate @xmath349 we can repeat the 2 and 3-dimensional arguments for non - free actions .",
    "in the same way that orbit matrices have proven useful in a number of broader settings , the analysis extends to other settings where we can create square pinned orbit matrices .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the rigidity matrix @xmath350 of a -symmetric framework @xmath351 can be transformed into a block - decomposed form , where each block @xmath352 corresponds to an irreducible representation @xmath353 of the group @xmath46 .",
    "this breaks up the rigidity analysis of @xmath351 into a number of independent subproblems @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fully -symmetric rigidity properties of @xmath351 are described by the block matrix @xmath354 corresponding to the trivial irreducible representation @xmath355 of @xmath46 .",

    ", an orbit matrix was established for _ each _ of the blocks @xmath356 in the case where the group is abelian , and these new tools were successfully used to characterize -generic infinitesimally rigid graphs ( i.e. , graphs @xmath45 with the property that -generic realisations of @xmath45 do not have _ any _ non - trivial infinitesimal motions ) in the plane for the groups @xmath99 , @xmath267 and @xmath195 .    since the structure of the ` anti - symmetric ' orbit matrices is similar to the structure of the orbit matrix from definition  [ orbitmatrixdef ]",
    ", we expect that the methods and results established in this paper can be extended to these other orbit matrices in a straightforward fashion .",
    "this would allow us to analyse symmetric frameworks for infinitesimal motions and stresses that break certain symmetries , but preserve others .",
    "however , note that an ` anti - symmetric ' infinitesimal motion typically does not extend to a finite motion @xcite .",
    "all of the techniques ( and even examples ) of this paper extend directly to spherical linkages , which are studied in settings such as @xcite chapters 7 - 10 .",
    "papers such as @xcite carry out the transfer for all orbit matrices , including the original rigidity matrix ( where the group is the identity ) .",
    "there is no complication to transferring these transfer processes to pinned frameworks , and the -assur decompositions will also transfer .",
    "all the techniques also extend to cones - provided the cone point ( or the cone point and its symmetric images ) has the appropriate symmetry .",
    "periodic frameworks in the plane have been studied by a number of groups . whether the lattice is fixed @xcite , partially variable or fully flexible",
    "there is a natural rigidity matrix which can be made square by pinning .",
    "moreover periodic frameworks have been understood combinatorially using gain graphs .",
    "hence there is potential to use the techniques in this paper to generate assur decompositions when one vertex in the fixed lattice can substitute for the ground .    in @xcite frameworks in 3-dimensions supported on fixed surfaces have been studied and symmetric analogues of theorem [ thm : symmetry_reflection ] have been obtained .",
    "the rigidity matrix has @xmath357 columns and when the framework is isostatic @xmath358 rows ( where @xmath246 is the number of isometries of @xmath359 admitted by the surface ) .",
    "when the surface admits no isometries of @xmath359 then no pinning is required .",
    "however unlike the situation in figure [ fig : d_2 ] , all frameworks on such a surface can be considered as pinned .",
    "otherwise it seems like these frameworks should be decomposable into assur components by pinning @xmath246 degrees of freedom to make the matrix square and then applying the techniques in this paper .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 5.1 ) it was outlined how to extend the equivalence of assur decompositions to various alternative types of frameworks allowing bodies , bars , joints , pins , hinges , etc .",
    "all of these kinds of mechanisms occur in the mechanical engineering literature .",
    "all of the techniques and results of this paper will have analogous decompositions under symmetry , since the symmetry - adapted analogues of the basic rigidity results have recently been developed .    in @xcite",
    "general cad systems in 3-dimensions were investigated with constraint matrices which are analogs of the rigidity matrices for bodies and bars .",
    "it is natural to consider pinned cad systems ( essentially make one of the bodies the ground ) and to also consider systems of symmetric cad constraints .",
    "we anticipate all of the decompositions described here will again extend to these more general sets of constraints",
    ".      in @xcite many combinatorial properties of 2-assur graphs were developed by considering minimal dependencies in the rigidity matrix .",
    "since the rigidity matrix induces a linear matroid known as the rigidity matroid , these minimal dependencies are known as circuits .",
    "let us define a _",
    "-circuit _ to be a graph @xmath45 for which the rows of @xmath360 ( with @xmath29 -regular ) induce a circuit in the forced -- symmetric rigidity matroid .",
    "then @xmath243 is a -circuit if and only if there is a unique vector in the cokernel of the orbit matrix which is non - zero in every coordinate . in other words",
    "@xmath45 is a -circuit if and only if it has a unique -symmetric self - stress which is non - zero on all edges .",
    "let @xmath361 be the graph formed by collapsing all vertices in @xmath6 to a single vertex @xmath362 ( and every edge of the form @xmath145 for @xmath363 is replaced by the corresponding edge @xmath364 ) .",
    "a key necessary condition for @xmath361 to be a circuit when @xmath243 is -assur is that the degree of freedom of the ` ground ' under @xmath365 is @xmath169 larger than the degree of freedom of a single vertex fixed by the group @xmath365 .",
    "this observation leads us to consider 3 candidates , although 2 of them ( mirror symmetry or rotational symmetry in 3-space ) are ruled out since flexible circuits such as the double banana translate to the symmetric setting . consider figure [ fig : weakly ] : the @xmath195-gain graph , with ground shrunk , becomes -dependent but not a circuit .",
    "this leaves rotation symmetry in the plane where a full ground has @xmath169 degree of freedom , while a single vertex fixed on the axis has no degrees of freedom .",
    "figure [ fig : circuits ] illustrate this , see also figures  [ fig : desargues ] and [ fig : desargues2 ] .",
    "let @xmath100 , @xmath171 , be a rotation group , in the plane , centred at the origin .",
    "let @xmath366 be pinned @xmath100-regular . for @xmath361 choose @xmath367 to equal @xmath368 on all inner vertices and @xmath369",
    ". then @xmath243 is @xmath100-assur if and only if @xmath361 is a @xmath100-circuit .",
    "the conjecture seems to require a version of theorem [ thm : scounts ] for arbitrary group actions .",
    "since there is little theory for -circuits that we could make use of , we have not exerted much effort in trying to prove it by alternate means .",
