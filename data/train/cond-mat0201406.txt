    "recently , nanospin systems have emerged as good candidates to display quantum phenomena at a mesoscopic or macroscopic scale.@xcite theoretical investigations showed that quantum tunneling was possible in ferromagnetic ( fm ) nanoparticles containing as much as @xmath2 spins.@xcite at extremely low temperature , the magnitude of the total magnetization @xmath3 is frozen out and thereby its direction becomes the only dynamical variable . in the absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy can create energetically degenerate easy directions depending on the crystal symmetry .",
    "tunneling between neighboring states removes the degeneracy of the original ground states and leads to a level splitting .",
    "this phenomenon is called macroscopic quantum coherence ( mqc ) . however , mqc is hard to be observed in experiments without controlling the height and the width of the barrier .",
    "it has been believed that a magnetic field is a good external parameter to make the quantum tunneling observable . by applying a magnetic field in a proper direction ,",
    "one of the two energetically equivalent orientations becomes metastable and the magnetization vector can escape from the metastable state through the barrier to a stable one , which is called macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) .",
    "a large number of experiments involving resonance measurements , magnetic relaxation , and hysteresis loop study , mssbauer spectroscopy , and neutron scattering study for various systems showed either temperature - independent relaxation phenomena or a well - defined resonance depending exponentially on the number of total spins , which supported the idea of magnetic quantum tunneling.@xcite    to our knowledge , the tunneling of a single spin degree of freedom was first studied by korenblit and shender in 1978.@xcite more recently , the tunneling problem of the magnetization reversal was studied extensively for the single - domain fm nanoparticles in a magnetic field applied at an arbitrary angle .",
    "this problem was studied by zaslavskii with the help of mapping the spin system onto a one - dimensional particle system.@xcite for the same system , miguel and chudnovsky@xcite calculated the tunneling rate by applying the imaginary - time path integral , and demonstrated that the angular and field dependences of the tunneling exponent obtained by zaslavskii s method and by the path - integral method coincide precisely .",
    "kim and hwang performed a calculation based on the instanton technique for fm particles with biaxial and tetragonal crystal symmetry,@xcite and kim extended the tunneling rate for biaxial crystal symmetry to a finite temperature.@xcite the quantum - classical transition of the escape rate for uniaxial spin system in an arbitrarily directed field was investigated by garanin , hidalgo and chudnovsky with the help of mapping onto a particle moving in a double - well potential.@xcite the switching field measurement was carried out on single - domain fm nanoparticles of barium ferrite ( bafecotio ) containing about @xmath2 spins.@xcite the measured angular dependance of the crossover temperature was found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction,@xcite which strongly suggests the quantum tunneling of magnetization in the bafecotio nanoparticles .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to present an analytical study of the quantum tunneling _ at excited levels _ in the fm particles with an arbitrarily directed field .",
    "moreover , the system considered in this paper has a much more complex structure ( i. e. , _ the general structure in experiments _ ) , such as trigonal , tetragonal , and hexagonal crystal symmetry . by applying an arbitrarily directed magnetic field , the problem does not possess any symmetry and for that reason is more difficult mathematically .",
    "however , it is worth pursuing because of its significance for experiments and the easiest to implement in practice . since the result of spin tunneling at excited levels for tetragonal symmetry is a generalization of that of tunneling at ground - state levels studied by kim and hwang,@xcite we can compare our results with theirs by taking the low - energy limit .",
    "we will show that mqc and mqt can be consecutively observed by changing the direction of magnetic field , and discuss their dependence on the direction and the magnitude of field .",
    "the dependence of the crossover temperature @xmath4 and the magnetic viscosity ( which is the inverse of wkb  exponent at the quantum - tunneling - dominated regime @xmath5 ) on the direction and the magnitude of the field , and the magnetic anisotropies is expected to be observed in future experiments on individual single - domain particles with different magnetocrystalline anisotropies .",
    "both the nonvacuum ( or thermal ) instanton or bounce solution , the wkb exponents and the preexponential factors are evaluated exactly for different angle ranges of the magnetic field @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the low - energy limit of our results agrees well with that of ground - state spin tunneling .",
    "in order to compare theories with experiments , predictions of the crossover temperature corresponding to the transition from classical to quantum behavior and the temperature dependence of the decay rate are clearly shown in this paper .",
    "both variables are expressed as a function of parameters which can be changed experimentally , such as the number of total spins , the effective anisotropy constants , the strength and orientation of applied magnetic field .",
    "our results show that the distinct angular dependence , together with the dependence of the wkb tunneling rate on the strength of the external magnetic field , may provide an independent experimental test for the spin tunneling at excited levels in nanoscale magnets .",
    "when the effective magnetic anisotropy of the particle is known , our theoretical results give clear predictions with no fitting parameters . therefore",
    ", quantum spin tunneling could be studied as a function of the effective magnetic anisotropy .",
    "our results should be helpful for future experiments on spin tunneling in single - domain particles with different magnetocrystalline anisotropies .",

    ", the dominant contribution to the transition amplitude comes from finite action solution ( instanton or bounce ) of the classical equation of motion .",

    "however , the instanton technique is suitable only for the evaluation of the tunneling rate or the tunnel splitting at the vacuum level , since the usual ( vacuum ) instantons satisfy the vacuum boundary conditions . in this paper",

    "the temperature dependences of the decay rates are clearly shown for each case .",
    "the low - energy limit of our results agrees well with that of ground - state spin tunneling .",
    "one important conclusion is that the tunneling rate and the tunnel splitting at excited levels depend on the orientation of the external magnetic field distinctly .",

    "another interesting conclusion concerns the field strength dependence of the wkb  exponent in the tunnel splitting or the tunneling rate .",

    ", we conclude that both the orientation and the strength of the external magnetic field are the controllable parameters for the experimental test of the phenomena of quantum tunneling and coherence of the magnetization vector between excited levels in single - domain fm nanoparticles at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "if the experiment is to be performed , there are three control parameters for comparison with theory : the angle of the external magnetic field @xmath48 , the strength of the field in terms of @xmath76 , and the temperature @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath48 dependence of the crossover temperature @xmath4 and the angle corresponding to the maximal value of @xmath4 are expected to be observed in further experiments .    in order to avoid the complications due to distributions of particle size and shape , some groups have tried to study the temperature and field dependence of magnetization reversal of individual magnets .",
    "recently , wernsdorfer and co - workers have performed the switching field measurements on individual ferrimagnetic and insulating bafecotio nanoparticles containing about @xmath283-@xmath284 spins at very low temperatures ( 0.1 - 6k).@xcite they found that above 0.4k , the magnetization reversal of these particles is unambiguously described by the nel - brown theory of thermal activated rotation of the particle s moment over a well defined anisotropy energy barrier . below 0.4k , strong deviations from this model are evidenced which are quantitatively in agreement with the predictions of the mqt theory without dissipation.@xcite the bafecotio nanoparticles have a strong uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy.@xcite however , the theoretical results presented here may be useful for checking the general theory in a wide range of systems , with more general magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the experimental procedures on single - domain fm  nanoparticles of barium ferrite with uniaxial symmetry@xcite may be applied to the systems with more general symmetries .",
    "note that the inverse of the wkb exponent @xmath285 is the magnetic viscosity @xmath19 at the quantum - tunneling - dominated regime @xmath286 studied by magnetic relaxation measurements.@xcite therefore , the quantum tunneling of the magnetization should be checked at any @xmath48 by magnetic relaxation measurements . over the past years a lot of experimental and theoretical works were performed on the spin tunneling in molecular mn@xmath287-ac@xcite and fe@xmath288@xcite clusters having a collective spin state @xmath289 ( in this paper @xmath290 ) .",
    "these measurements on molecular clusters with @xmath289 suggest that quantum phenomena might be observed at larger system sizes with @xmath291 .",
