    "the present global pdf analyses ( e.g.  nnpdf3.0  @xcite , mmht2014  @xcite , ct14  @xcite ) find that there is a large uncertainty in the low @xmath10 behaviour of the gluon distribution .",
    "there is a lack of appropriate very low @xmath10 data , particularly at low scales .",
    "however , recently measurements on open charm and open beauty in the forward direction have been presented by the lhcb collaboration @xcite ; moreover , the atlas collaboration has measured open charm production in the central rapidity region  @xcite .",
    "these data sample the gluon distribution at rather low @xmath10 : namely in the domain @xmath16 .",
    "a discussion of the data in terms of existing global pdfs has been presented in @xcite , and they have been incorporated in a fit with the hera deep inelastic data in @xcite .    in the ideal case",
    "it would be good to have such data where both the heavy quark and the heavy antiquark were measured , since when we observe only one quark ( one heavy hadron ) the value of @xmath10 that is probed is smeared out over an order of magnitude by the unknown momentum of the unobserved quark in the @xmath17-pair @xcite , where @xmath18 , see e.g. fig.1 in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even measurements of the inclusive cross section of one heavy quark can be used to check and further constrain the existing pdfs .",
    "another problem , which was emphasized in  @xcite , is that the qcd prediction at nlo level strongly depends on the factorization scale , @xmath19 , assumed in the calculation .",
    "we might expect that the major source of the strong @xmath19 dependence arises because in the dglap evolution of low @xmath10 pdfs the probability of emitting a new gluon is strongly enhanced by the large value of @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , the mean number of gluons in the interval @xmath21 is  @xcite n ( 1/x)_f^2 , [ eq : n ] leading to a value of @xmath22 up to about 8 , for the case @xmath23 with the usual @xmath19 scale variation interval from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , the nlo coefficient function allows for the emission of only _",
    "one _ gluon .",
    "therefore we can not expect compensation between the contributions coming from the pdf and the coefficient function as we vary the scale @xmath19 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this strong double - logarithmic part of the scale dependence can be successfully resummed by choosing an appropriate scale , @xmath0 , in the pdf convoluted with the lo hard matrix element , which in our case is @xmath26 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] we recall the method of performing the resummation to determine the optimal scale @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : renorm ]",
    "we justify choosing the renormalization scale equal to the factorization scale .",
    "then in section  [ sec : opt41 ] we use the procedure discussed in section  [ sec : two ] , to resum the ln@xmath27 terms so as to determine the optimum factorization scale , @xmath0 . unfortunately for heavy @xmath28 production ( unlike the drell - yan process ) a large sensitivity to the choice of scale remains . in section  [ sec:2to2 ]",
    "we identify the source of the problem to be the important @xmath6 ( that is @xmath7 ) diagrams at nlo and higher orders .",
    "we argue that it is possible to also resum these diagrams .",
    "we then find the scale sensitivity is reduced",
    ". it would be advantageous if both heavy mesons ( arising from @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) could be measured experimentally , but , at present , the statistics are limited .",
    "however , a possibility to circumvent this problem is discussed in section  [ sec : azim ] . in section  [ sec : data ] we return to open single inclusive @xmath8 and @xmath9 production and compare the qcd predictions with the optimal scale with lhc data ; and are able to make an observation about the gluon pdf at low @xmath10 .",
    "in section  [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusion .",
    "here we recall the procedure proposed in @xcite , which provides a reduction in the sensitivity to the choice of factorization scale by resumming the enhanced double - logarithmic contributions from a knowledge of the nlo contribution .",
    "the cross section for open heavy quark production at lo + nlo at factorization scale @xmath31 may be expressed in the form on the quantities in  ( [ eq : sta ] ) and the following equations .",
    "the matrix form of the equations is implied . ]",
    "@xmath32\\ , ,   \\label{eq : sta}\\ ] ] where the coefficient function @xmath33 does not depend on the factorisation scale , while the @xmath31 dependence of the nlo coefficient function arises since we have to subtract from the nlo diagrams the part already generated by lo evolution .    we are free to evaluate the lo contribution at a different scale @xmath19 , since the resulting effect can be _ compensated _ by changes in the nlo coefficient function , which then also becomes dependent on @xmath19 . in this way eq .",
    "( [ eq : sta ] ) becomes @xmath34\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : stab1}\\ ] ] note that although the first and second terms on the right hand side depend on @xmath19 , their sum , however , does not ( to @xmath35 ) , and is equal to the full lo+nlo cross section calculated at the factorization scale @xmath31 .",
    "originally the nlo coefficient functions @xmath36 are calculated from feynman diagrams which are independent of the factorization scale .",
    "how does the @xmath19 dependence of @xmath37 in  ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) actually arise ?",
    "it occurs because we must subtract from @xmath36 the @xmath38 term which was already included in the lo contribution . since the lo contribution was calculated up to some scale @xmath19 the value of @xmath36 after the subtraction depends on the value @xmath19 chosen for the lo component .",
    "the change of scale of the lo contribution from @xmath31 to @xmath19 also means we have had to change the factorisation scale which enters the coefficient function @xmath36 from @xmath31 to @xmath19 .",
    "the effect of this scale change is driven by the lo dglap evolution , which is given by ^(0)(_f )  =   _",
    "s^2  pdf(_f)(c^(0 ) + ( ) ( p_leftc^0 ) + c^(0 ) p_right ) ) ( _ f ) , [ eq : dg ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote dglap splitting functions acting on the pdfs to the left and right respectively .",
    "that is , by choosing to evaluate @xmath41 at scale @xmath19 we have moved the part of the nlo ( i.e. @xmath38 ) corrections given by the last term of  ( [ eq : dg ] ) from the nlo to the lo part of the cross section . in this way @xmath36 becomes the remaining @xmath19-dependent coefficient function @xmath42 of  ( [ eq : stab1 ] ) .",
    "[ h ]    the idea is to choose a scale @xmath43 such that the remaining nlo term does not contain the double - logarithmic @xmath44 contributions .",
    "it is impossible to nullify the whole nlo contribution since the function @xmath45 depends also on other variables ; in particular , it depends on the mass , @xmath46 , of the system produced by the hard matrix element . on the other hand",
    "we can choose such a value of @xmath47 which makes @xmath48 in the limit of large @xmath49 .",
    "recall that the @xmath3 factor arises in the nlo after the convolution of the large @xmath46 asymptotics of hard subprocess cross section with the incoming parton low-@xmath10 distributions satisfying xq(x )   or   xg(x ) .    at nlo level",
    "the change @xmath31 to @xmath19 is irrelevant : eq.([eq : stab1 ] ) is an identity ( it just changes the higher order terms ) .",
    "however , in this way we simultaneously resum all the higher order double - logarithmic contributions in the pdfs@xmath50 of the lo part . as a result",
    "we are able to suppress the scale dependence caused by large values of log@xmath27 .",
    "thus the choice of @xmath51 , which nullifies @xmath36 at large @xmath49 , excludes the double log ( dl ) , @xmath52 , contribution from the nlo correction by resumming the series of double - logarithmic terms in the pdfs , which are then convoluted with the lo coefficient functions . to find the appropriate value of @xmath0 we must choose the nlo subprocess driven by the same ladder - type diagrams ( in the axial gauge ) as the ladder diagrams that describe lo dglap evolution .",
    "the appropriate subprocess is gluon - light quark fusion , @xmath53 . in the high energy limit , where the subprocess energy satisfies @xmath54 , the cross section described by this subprocess contains double - logarithmic terms  log@xmath55 log@xmath56 .",
    "the subprocess @xmath53 is contained in the sketch of fig .",
    "[ fig : tolo](b ) , where it is shown pictorially how the enhanced double - logarithmic terms are transferred to the pdfs in the lo term .",
    "we note that , in general , this decomposition can be continued to higher order .",
    "for example , if the nnlo contribution is known , then we will have three scales : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , ^(0)(_f ) + ^(1)(_f ) + ^(2)(_f )  =  _ s^2  [  pdf(_0)c^(0 ) ( _ 0 )  +    +  pdf(_1)_s c_rem^(1)(_0 ) ( _ 1 )  +   pdf(_f)^2_s c_rem^(2)(_0,_1 ) ( _ f )  ]  , [ eq : stab11 ] where the scale @xmath58 is chosen to nullify the final term in the small @xmath10 limit .",
    "in fact in section [ sec:2to2 ] we will use this equation to include the important @xmath6 ( that is , @xmath59 subprocess at nlo and higher orders .",
    "we will show reasons why the scale choice @xmath60 will give a good approximation for the resummation of these higher - order @xmath6 contributions .",
    "the approach we have introduced is based on collinear factorization",
    ". however , actually it is close in spirit to the @xmath61-factorization method .",
    "indeed , there , the value of the factorization scale is driven by the structure of the integral over @xmath61 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kt ] . in the @xmath61-factorization approach this @xmath61 integral",
    "is written explicitly , while the parton distribution _ unintegrated _ over @xmath61 is generated by the last step of the dglap evolution , similar to the prescription proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . then , using the known nlo result , we account for the _ exact _",
    "@xmath61 integration in the last cell adjacent to the lo hard matrix element .",
    "this hard matrix element @xmath62 , provides the convergence of the integral at large @xmath61 . in this way it puts an effective upper limit of the @xmath61 integral , which plays the role of an appropriate factorization scale .",
    "besides the factorization scale , the qcd prediction , truncated at nlo , strongly depends on the renormalization scale @xmath63 , since the lo term is already proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "let us discuss the possible choice of @xmath63 .",
    "first , it is reasonable to have @xmath65 , since we expect all the contributions with virtualities less than @xmath19 to be included in the pdfs , while those larger than @xmath19 to be assigned to the hard matrix element .",
    "this is in line with the fact that the current scale of the qcd coupling increases monotonically during the dglap evolution .",
    "so the coupling responsible for heavy quark production should have a scale @xmath63 equal to , or larger than , that in the evolution .",
    "another argument is based on the blm prescription @xcite , which says that all the contributions proportional to @xmath66 should be assigned to @xmath38 by choosing an appropriate scale @xmath63 .",
    "a good way to trace the @xmath67 contribution is to calculate the lo term generated by a new type of light quark , so @xmath68 .",
    "note that the new quark - loop insertion appears twice in the calculation .",
    "the part with scales @xmath69 is generated by the virtual ( @xmath70 ) component of the lo splitting during dglap evolution , while the part with @xmath71 accounts for the running @xmath38 behaviour obtained after the regularization of the ultraviolet divergence . in order not to miss some contribution and to avoid double counting",
    "we take the renormalization scale @xmath72 .",
    "the argument for this choice was made in more detail in  @xcite for the qed case .",
    "we emphasize ( see also  @xcite ) that the renormalisation scale dependence affects just the normalization of cross section , but not its energy behaviour .",
    "it is cancelled in the ratio of the cross sections measured at the lhc energy of 7 ( or 8 or 5 ) tev to that at 13 tev or in the ratio of the cross sections obtained at different rapidities .",
    "thus these ratios will probe the low @xmath10 dependence of the gluons at scale @xmath43 essentially without any uncertainties due to possible variations of the @xmath63 scale .",
    "here we implement the proposals of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stab1 ] ) and ( [ eq : stab11 ] ) in an attempt to reduce the factorization scale dependence of the qcd predictions for @xmath28 production in high - energy @xmath73 collisions . note , however , that calculating the nlo contribution of the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : tolo ] , we have integrated over the momenta of other particles ; in particular , over the transverse momentum , @xmath74 , of the light quark .",

    "the values that we find for the ` optimal ' scale @xmath0 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu0 ] as the function of @xmath82 ratio , where @xmath5 is the transverse momentum of the observed heavy quark .",
    "it turns out that the values of the optimal scale are close to the value @xmath83 that is used conventionally ; that is @xmath84 .",
    "however , we now have a physics justification for the scale choice shown in fig .",

    "we consider this observation as a strong argument in favour of the possibility to use the open charm / beauty data to constraint the low @xmath10 partons at the scale @xmath101 .",
    "since the major contribution to @xmath8 and @xmath9 production comes from gluon - gluon fusion ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gg ] ) , including these data in global parton analyses will allow a better study of the gluon low-@xmath10 behaviour , and hence to strongly diminish the present uncertainty observed in this region .",
    "in the case of open @xmath9 production the optimal scale is rather large ; typically @xmath102 gev@xmath103 . on the other hand ,",
    "the main uncertainties in the gluon pdf are observed at much lower scales @xmath104 2 - 4 gev@xmath103 .",
    "one possibility to reduce the scale at which the process probes the partons is to observe both heavy quarks ( i.e. both the quark and the antiquark ) , and then to select the events where the transverse momentum of the pair is small .",
    "this proposal was discussed in  @xcite ( and in  @xcite for drell - yan pair production ) .",
    "unfortunately , the _ transverse momenta _ of @xmath105 mesons can only be measured for a few particular decay modes , and the product of the branching ratios for the two @xmath105 mesons is small .",
    "it means that we do not have sufficient statistics .",
    "another idea was proposed by alexey dzyuba . as a rule",
    "the vertex of @xmath105 meson decay can be observed experimentally , and it is possible to measure the _ azimuthal angle _ , @xmath106 , between the two heavy mesons .",
    "that is , we may select @xmath107 events with good coplanarity . in such a case",
    "the transverse momenta of the incoming partons must be small , otherwise the coplanarity will be destroyed . in other words , for events with a small @xmath108",
    "we deal with lower scale partons .",
    "for example , in table  [ tab : a ] we show the optimal scale @xmath109 calculated for events with @xmath110 corresponding to the lhcb rapidity interval @xmath111 . as expected , for low @xmath112 we have @xmath113 .",
