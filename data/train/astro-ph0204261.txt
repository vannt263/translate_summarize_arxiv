    "g0.9 + 0.1 is the only composite snr known in the direction of the gc ( d@xmath6 10kpc , @xmath7@xmath8 ) : a bright centrally condensed synchrotron nebula ( with relatively flat spectral index ) , powered by the loss of rotational energy from the neutron star , and a radio shell with a steeper radio spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite were able to fit the _ bepposax _ x - ray spectrum of the pwn with a power - law and interpret the x - ray emission as non - thermal in origin .",
    "the small angular extent of the x - ray emission ( radius @xmath6 1 ) , combined with an estimated age of the remnant of a few thousand years , is further evidence that the central radio core is powered by a young pulsar ( @xmath6 2,700yr ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , g0.9 + 0.1 was observed with _",
    "chandra _ by @xcite .",
    "they found that the synchrotron - emitting pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) has a clear axial symmetry and a faint x - ray point source lying along the symmetry axis possibly corresponds to the pulsar itself .",
    "they argued that the nebular morphology can be explained in terms of a torus of emission in the pulsar s equatorial plane and a jet directed along the pulsar spin axis , as is seen in the x - ray nebulae powered by other young pulsars ( crab , vela ) .",
    "here , we present the observations of g0.9 + 0.1 obtained with _ xmm - newton _ and we focus on the first spectral analysis of the large and small - scale structures of the pwn ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "we present in this section the spectral analysis of the pwn using combined fits of the mos and pn data .",
    "the observation time after screening rejection of the flares are respectively for mos1 and mos2 about 15.5ksec and 15.4ksec , and 10ksec for pn .",
    "we use the following camera response matrices : m1@xmath9medv9q20t5r6@xmath9all@xmath915.rsp , m2@xmath9medv9q20t5r6@xmath9all@xmath915.rsp , epn@xmath9ef20@xmath9sdy9@xmath9medium.rsp .",
    "the local background used corresponds to the central mos1 ccd region excluding the bright point sources and the central part within a radius of 2.6. we subtract from the source and the local background in our pointing , a blank - field observation ( kindly provided by david lumb ) at the same position in order to take into account the particle background ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the normalization between our pointing and the blank - field files is determined respectively by the count rate ratio in the 1012kev range for the mos and 1214kev for the pn .",
    "the epic spectra were binned to give s / n@xmath103 .",
    "xspec v11.1.0 was used for the spectral analysis .",
    "all subsequent errors are quoted at 90@xmath11 confidence .",
    "abundances are those of @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation of the supernova remnant g0.9 + 0.1 shows emission from the pwn , but not from the surrounding shell observed in radio .",
    "the soft x - ray emission expected from the shell is likely not seen due to the large interstellar absorption towards the source .",
    "the epic image of the pwn in g0.9 + 0.1 is presented in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "it exhibits a very bright central core , surrounded by extended diffuse emission .",
    "the extent of this emission is about twice larger than observed with _",
    "chandra _ , thanks to the high sensitivity of _ xmm - newton_.    for comparison with previous analysis , we fit the spectrum of the overall nebula .",
    "the region considered corresponds to the sum of the core with regions 1 , 2 and 3 , as is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the data are well fitted by either a power - law or a thermal bremsstrahlung ( table  [ table : table1 ] ) . for the photo - electric absorption ,",
    "we use the cross - sections of @xcite .",
    "the parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath2 ) related to the power - law are compatible , within the error bars , with the _ bepposax _ values ( @xcite : @xmath12=10.9@xmath13@xmath8 , @xmath2=1.95@xmath14 ) , though slightly higher but more tightly constrained . in the following , we use the updated cross - sections for x - ray absorption by the ism ( tbabs in xspec ) from @xcite .",

    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ table : table2 ] .",
    "letting the absorption column densities free do not afford significantly better fits , and the values of column density @xmath33 are compatible to within 15@xmath11 for the different regions of the nebula .",
    "+    a clear steepening of the spectrum is observed from the inner part toward the outer part of the pwn as is shown in figure  [ fig : gamma - r ] .",
    "the observed spectral softening with radius in g0.9 + 0.1 from the core to the outskirts of the pwn , is most likely due to the effect of synchrotron radiation losses on the highest energy electrons as they progress through the nebula .",
    "for comparison we have reported on figure  [ fig : gamma - r ] the variation of the spectral index inferred from the observation of ic443 by @xcite .",
    "the axis unit used ( r@xmath35 , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - r ] and in @xcite ) gives a measure independent on the distance to the nebulae .",
    "our data appear to show a stronger softening from the core to the outer part of the nebula of g0.9 + 0.1 , compared to ic443 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - r ] ) , and also to other pwne such as 3c58 and g21.5 - 0.9 ( see for comparison fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "this could be consistent with a stronger magnetic field in the galactic center region compared to other snr environments .",
    "the contours ( in black ) corresponds to the _ chandra _ observation in the same energy range .",
    "the white boxes represent different small - scale structures surrounding the bright core ( dark blue circle ) , for which the spectral index and 90@xmath11 confidence uncertainties are given .",
    "the position of the structures were determined according to the _ chandra _ observation ( see gaensler et al .",
    "2001 ) : `` east arc '' ( @xmath36 1.2 ) , `` jet '' ( @xmath36 1.8 ) , and `` south - west arc '' ( @xmath36 2.8 ) . ]    the brightest region of the nebula corresponds to a core of angular diameter 8   as observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. the _ chandra _ observation has resolved it as an elliptical clump of size 5  @xmath37  8   ( @xcite ) . the faint point source proposed to be the pulsar by @xcite is outside this region ( about 8   from the center of the clump ) .",
    "the fact that the hardest spectral index is obtained for the core would likely indicate that it hosts the pulsar . as proposed by @xcite",
    ", this clump may also be an analog to the knots observed in the crab nebula ( @xcite ) and close to the vela pulsar ( @xcite ) , which exhibit variability in brightness , position and morphology .",
    "the position and the morphology are however very similar in both _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations which are separated from only about one month .",
    "the nature of the bright core is still unclear : a clump , which could be a region of separate particle acceleration as in ( @xcite ) , or a very compact region in which the pulsar is embedded ? .",
    "tracing the spectral variations in the small - scale structures around the core is then essential for understanding this particular pwn .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma ] displays a closer view of the inner region and shows the small - scale structures present around the core of pwn g0.9 + 0.1 . for comparison",
    ", the x - ray contours of the _ chandra _ data are superposed . in our data ,",
    "the small - scale structures are not so clearly detected as with _",
    "( jet - like and arc - like features ) .",
    "however using the position of the structures seen by _",
    "chandra _ and the high sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _ , we were for the first time able to carry out spectral analysis of these small - scale structure . determining their spectral index gives an indication of the geometry and orientation of the nebula .",
    "figure  [ fig : gamma ] reports the photon spectral index of the corresponding structures obtained with combined fits ( mos and pn ) .",
    "the region corresponding to the eastern part of the arc - like feature in @xcite , shows the hardest spectral index ( @xmath41.2@xmath50.5 ) among all the structures together with the core region ( @xmath41.1@xmath5 0.5 ) . on the contrary the region corresponding to",
    "the south - west part of the arc - like feature , appears to have the steepest photon index ( @xmath42.8@xmath50.7 ) over all the pwn .",
    "a possible explanation is that the east arc is pointing towards the observer and that its spectral hardness is due to the relativistic beaming or doppler boosting of the electrons , while the south - west arc is the opposite part of the torus .",
    "the region associated to the jet - like feature in @xcite does not exhibit a harder spectrum as suggested by their hardness ratio .",
    "we report _ xmm - newton _ observations of the x - ray pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) inside the composite supernova remnant g0.9 + 0.1 ( @xcite ) , which was convincingly detected for the first time in x - rays by _ bepposax _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ the large - scale image of the pwn g0.9 + 0.1 shows a very bright central core , surrounded by relatively large - scale diffuse emission with a much spatial extent than is apparent for the recent _ chandra _ images .",
    "thanks to its high sensitivity , _ xmm - newton _ allows for the first time a spectral analysis of the large and small - scale structures ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our spectral analysis combining the mos and pn data offers a clear indication of a softening of the spectrum with distance from the centroid ( related to the finite lifetime of the synchrotron emitting electrons ) , as observed in other known x - ray plerions .",
    "even if in our data , the small - scale structures are not so clearly detected as in the _ chandra _ data ( jet - like and arc - like features ) , we were able for the first time to carry out their spectral analysis .",
    "two of the structures show distinct spectral indexes from the general trend ( from @xmath41.6@xmath50.5 to @xmath41.8@xmath50.6 ) : the eastern part of the arc - like feature has a very hard photon index ( @xmath41.2@xmath50.5 ) , while the south - west part of the arc - like feature has a softer photon index ( @xmath42.8@xmath50.7 ) .",
    "+ the study of g0.9 + 0.1 provides further clues concerning the processes by which pulsars connect with their environment and also illustrates the impact of a strong ambient magnetic field as in the galactic center region .",
