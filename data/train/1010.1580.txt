    "interest in charge transport properties of carbon nanotubes ( cnt)@xcite has grown consistently in the last few years , in part because of their possible applications as single electron transistors ( sets),@xcite as well as their possible use in molecular computing.@xcite a cnt set can be manufactured by coupling a cnt quantum dot ( qd ) to metal leads@xcite . in this case , below a certain characteristic temperature @xmath1 , the kondo effect@xcite was first observed in cnt qds in 2000.@xcite further investigation showed that the main difference between the kondo effect in cnt qds , and the same effect in other nano - structures , comes from the degeneracy of the orbital ( chiral ) states of the cnt qd.@xcite effectively , while in the one hand the kondo effect in , e.g. , a lateral semiconducting qd is associated to the screening of a localized magnetic moment ( in general , with su(2 ) symmetry ) by the spin density of the conduction electrons , in the other hand , in a cnt qd the two degenerate orbital states with different chirality ( usually referred to as a pseudospin ) , together with the intrinsic spin degree of freedom , give rise to the so - called su(4 ) kondo effect .",
    "this exotic state has been recently studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite some of the many particular characteristics of the su(4 ) kondo effect are ( i ) a larger kondo temperature than in the su(2 ) case , ( ii ) kondo effects at two different fillings , namely , quarter - filling and half - filling , with diverse properties,@xcite ( iii ) a rich behavior under magnetic field,@xcite ( iv ) perfect entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom,@xcite among others .    another interesting regime in the su(4 ) kondo hamiltonian can be obtained by the gradual ` mixing ' of orbital states at the tunneling barriers , through tunneling that effects a flip in the pseudospin of the electron [ henceforth , pseudospin conserving tunneling occurs through a matrix element @xmath2 , and non - conserving through @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "when this mixing is total ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) , one reaches the so - called two - level su(2 ) ( 2lsu2 ) state.@xcite one constraint associated to the use of a cnt qd to observe su(4 ) kondo physics is the lack of control over the parameters of the system ( intra- and inter - orbital coulomb repulsions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , and couplings to leads ) , making it impossible to freely navigate from the su(4 ) to the 2lsu2 state .",
    "in contrast , recent advances in the lithography of semiconducting lateral qds have allowed greater control over capacitively coupled double quantum dot ( dqd ) systems connected to independent leads.@xcite in reality , it was in a dqd system that the first claim of observation of the su(4 ) kondo effect was made.@xcite as long as progress in this field continues to be made , it is not unlikely that the 2lsu2 regime will be accessible to experimental probing in the near future .",
    "indeed , in the same way that the su(4 ) regime has been shown to be quite robust regarding a difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and some mixing of the orbital states ( although _ strict _",
    "su(4 ) symmetry only occurs at one point in parameter space ) , @xcite most of the relevant phenomena described here for the 2lsu2 state are shown to survive a deviation of @xmath7 from @xmath8 .",
    "it is for that reason that we elect to use the terminology su(4 ) and 2lsu2 _ regimes _ , since as far as experiments go , their characteristic properties do not seem to be restricted to the corresponding point in parameter space ( we choose to refer to these specific points as su(4 ) and 2lsu2 _ states _ ) .    in this paper , using three different numerical techniques , namely the numerical renormalization group ( nrg),@xcite the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite and the logarithmically discretized embedded cluster approximation ( ldeca),@xcite we analyze in detail the opposite end of the su(4 ) regime , the above mentioned 2lsu2 regime .",
    "@xcite using the notation defined above , the difference between the su(4 ) and 2lsu2 regimes resides in the value of the ratio @xmath9 : @xmath10 corresponds to the su(4 ) regime ( no orbital mixing ) and @xmath11 to the 2lsu2 regime ( total orbital mixing ) .",
    "the motivations for the study presented here are four - fold : first , in previous work by two of the current authors , a charge discontinuity and a transition from a @xmath12 to @xmath13 maximum conductance was observed in the 2lsu2 regime ( @xmath13 is the conductance quantum).@xcite second , in these same works , a fine - structure of conductance peaks ( @xmath12 high and positioned at and around the particle - hole ( p - h ) symmetric point ) was observed for parameter values in the 2lsu2 regime , superimposed over a flat background of height @xmath13 .",
    "third , a slave boson analysis of the local density of states ( ldos ) showed a discontinuous change of the kondo peak _ at _ the 2lsu2 regime .",
    "@xcite all these three points mentioned above were never fully explained , some of them being thought to be related to convergence problems in the numerical methods used .",
    "@xcite here , we will show that this is not the case , and that they are associated to a band - decoupling at the 2lsu2 state and to an interesting competition between two distinct many - body ground states . finally , the above mentioned advances in manufacturing of capacitively coupled dqds may open the doors for the experimental analysis of the regime theoretically discussed here .",
    "note that to facilitate the connection and comparison with previous work by some of the authors , we will keep referring to the system under study as a cnt qd , although the regime of parameters to be analyzed ( @xmath14 ) may not be accessible to cnt qds .",
    "another interesting aspect of the results presented here is that the points mentioned above ( charge discontinuity , change from double- to single - channel charge transport , fine structure of the conductance , and discontinuity in the ldos kondo peak ) can be more easily understood after a change of basis from ` atomic ' to ` molecular ' orbitals ( aos to mos ) is applied .",
    "indeed , qds have been dubbed ` artificial atoms ' , and systems of two or more coupled qds have been dubbed ` artificial molecules ' .",
    "when the phenomena being analyzed depend more on the properties of quantum states involving more than one qd ( a ` molecular orbital ' ) , a change of basis from local states ( individual qds ) to extended states , involving two or more qds , should be done to help understand the phenomena being observed .",
    "@xcite in this work , the authors will present a situation where this change of basis is crucial for the understanding of the numerical results .",
    "this work is divided as follows : section ii briefly presents a description of the model hamiltonian , and the regime of parameters to be analyzed . in addition , a brief description of the band decoupling occurring at the 2lsu2 state is described by introducing molecular orbitals ( a detailed description is provided in appendix a ) .",
    "section iii presents charge vs. gate voltage results obtained with dmrg and nrg , at zero temperature .",
    "charge oscillations in the mos , as a function of gate voltage , are in perfect agreement between the two techniques .",
    "the nrg results are extended to finite temperatures , determining the energy scale of the phenomena relevant for the @xmath15-dependent charge oscillations .",
    "in addition , to facilitate the discussion of the results , the idea of an effective gate potential @xmath16 is introduced .",
    "section iv presents ldeca results for charge , conductance , and spin- and charge - fluctuations , _ away _ from the 2lsu2 point , in good qualitative agreement with the dmrg results .",
    "section v presents a discussion of the origin of the @xmath15-dependent charge oscillations observed in the mos , and , more importantly , an explanation of its dependence on the coupling of the cnt qd to the leads .",
    "these charge oscillations in the mos reveal a subtle competition between two many - body states , namely , the kondo state and the intermediate valence state . a simple way of quantifying this competition is obtained by using dmrg simulations to calculate the energy @xmath0 of the system for a wide window of gate potential @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "( 12 ) for its definition and discussion thereafter ) .",
    "in addition , the dmrg calculation of @xmath0 for the single impurity anderson model is compared to the kondo temperature expression derived by haldane.@xcite a finite size scaling of the dmrg results shows that @xmath0 tends to haldane s expression in a narrow window around the p - h symmetric point , leading the authors to speculate that the definition and numerical calculation of @xmath0 may be helpful to study correlated charge transport for a broad region of gate potential , including the kondo and intermediate valence regimes .",
    "section vi presents our conclusions .",
    "appendix a presents details of the basis transformation that results in the band decoupling essential to understand the properties of the 2lsu2 regime , and appendix b shows results for the non - interacting model ( @xmath17 ) .     and",
