    "in a few years , the ground - based detectors , advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and kagra , are expected to begin operation with sufficiently high sensitivity to detect gravitational wave ( gw ) signals from binary mergers of black holes ( bhs ) or neutron stars .",
    "we will have a very exciting era of general relativity , and many interesting sciences will be done .",
    "one interesting possibility is to find signals from unknown sources or effects of unestablished hypothetical theories .",
    "do we have a possibility to detect signals from string theory through gw detectors ?",
    "navely it seems difficult because the effect of string theory is expected to appear at very high energy scales ( e.g , the string scale ) .",
    "however , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite answered _ `` maybe yes , '' _ if there are string axions with ultralight masses . since string theories ( or m - theory ) require our spacetime to have 10 or 11 dimensions , the extra dimensions",
    "other than four have to be compactified .",
    "then , the extra dimensions have dynamical degrees of freedom of changing their shape and size which are called moduli , and they effectively behave as fields in our four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "one of the moduli will be the qcd axion .",
    "we can also expect the existence of other pseudoscalar fields with ultralight masses , called string axions , whose expected number is typically from 10 to 100 .",
    "the allowed mass range is from @xmath0  ev to @xmath1  ev and further below .",
    "depending on their masses , they cause a variety of phenomena that could be observed in the context of cosmophysics ( = cosmology and astrophysics ) .",
    "this is called the axiverse scenario ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) .",
    "suppose one of the string axions has mass @xmath2  ev .",
    "the compton wavelength @xmath3 is comparable to the radius of a bh with solar mass @xmath4 ( throughout this paper , we use the units @xmath5 ) .",
    "then , around a rotating solar - mass bh , there appears an unstable quasibound - state mode whose amplitude grows exponentially through the extraction of the bh rotation energy .",
    "this instability is called _",
    "superradiant instability_. due to this instability , an axion cloud is formed around the bh from quantum zero - point oscillations even if we start from vacuum .",
    "the growth rate has been calculated by approximate methods @xcite and by numerical methods @xcite by solving the frequency - domain eigenvalue problem .",
    "the maximum growth rate has been found to be @xmath6 , and the corresponding time scale to be around @xmath7 , which is much longer than @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ ac_growthrate ] ) . but this time scale is about @xmath9 minute for @xmath10 . even for @xmath11 ,",
    "the time scale is about @xmath9 day .",
    "therefore , for a wide range of parameters , the time scale of the superradiant instability is much shorter than the observation period of the ground - based gw detectors .",
    "the axion cloud becomes denser and denser as the superradiant instability proceeds , and two effects gradually become important .",
    "one is nonlinear self - interaction , and the other is the gw emission .",
    "here , the nonlinear self - interaction comes from the potential of the axion field @xmath12 , which is assumed to have the standard form @xmath13 $ ] in the present paper where @xmath14 is the axion decay constant . in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we numerically simulated the time evolution of an axion field obeying the sine - gordon equation in the kerr background spacetime .",
    "the result is that the nonlinear self - interaction leads to `` axion bosenova , '' which shares some features with the bosenova observed in experiments @xcite on bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the bosenova is characterized by the termination of superradiant instability and the gradual infall of positive energy from the axion cloud into the bh .",
    "the bosenova happens when the energy @xmath15 of the axion cloud becomes @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the planck mass .",
    "if @xmath14 corresponds to the gut scale , @xmath18  gev , the bosenova happens when axion cloud acquires 0.16% energy of the bh mass .    in the same paper @xcite",
    ", we also gave an order estimate of the amplitude of gws emitted during the bosenova , and found a possibility to detect signals from the bosenova if it happens around a bh near the solar system ( say , within 1 kpc ) .",
    "this motivates us to study gws from the bosenova in more detail .",
    "however , before doing that , we have to study gw emission _ before _ the bosenova , i.e. , in the superradiant phase .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the axion cloud obtains energy by extraction of bh s rotation energy , while it loses energy by emission of gws .",
    "the energy extraction rate @xmath19 is related to the superradiant growth rate as @xmath20 and therefore , it is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , the energy loss rate by the gw emission ( i.e. , the radiation rate ) is @xmath22 .",
    "this is because the perturbation equation indicates that the gw amplitude is proportional to @xmath15 , and the energy flux is proportional to the squared amplitude of gws .",
    "for this reason , @xmath19 is larger than @xmath23 when @xmath15 is sufficiently small .",
    "but there is a possibility that @xmath23 may catch up with @xmath19 as @xmath15 is increased .",
    "if this is the case , all of the extracted energy from the bh is converted into gws , and the growth of the axion cloud stops . then",
    ", bosenova does not happen and the gw emission stays at a level undetectable by gw experiments in the near future .",
    "the gw emission rate in the linear growth phase also gives us the lower bound on the expected gw fluxes from potential sources .",
    "therefore , the study of gws in the superradiant phase is important .",
    "approximate estimates of gw emissions from the bh - axion system were previously given by arvanitaki _ et .",
    "al _ in refs .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the gw radiation from a huge gravitational atom in newton potential was considered for the case @xmath24 .",
    "the two gw emission processes were pointed out .",
    "one is the radiation by level transitions of the axion cloud as a gravitational atom .",
    "this process occurs when the wavefunction of the axion cloud is given by the superposition of two or more levels of bound eigenstates , and gws of the frequencies identical to energy differences of the levels are radiated .",
    "the other is the annihilation of two axions .",
    "this can happen even for an axion cloud occupying just one bound - state level , and gws with the frequency @xmath25 are emitted , where @xmath26 is the ( real part of ) the axion bound - state frequency .",
    "for both processes , they derived approximate formulas for the gw radiation rates and concluded that the radiation rates are sufficiently small to allow the growth of the axion cloud by the superradiant instability until the occurrence of a bosenova .    in this paper , we consider the situation where approximately all of the axion particles occupy one bound - state level . because the gw radiation by the level transition is subdominant in such a situation , we focus on the two - axion annihilation process .",
    "we push forward the study of ref .",
    "@xcite on this process in two respects .",
    "first , since the approximate analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was limited to the case where the two axions to be annihilated are at the @xmath27 level ( i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , we extend to more general cases of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "next , we perform numerical calculations of the gw emission in the kerr background for general values of @xmath32 .",
    "this is certainly necessary because the superradiant instability for the modes @xmath33 and @xmath34 becomes effective when @xmath35 , where the approximation @xmath24 breaks down .",
    "similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis is done within the classical approximation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the general strategy and derive formulas that are used in the subsequent two sections . in sec .  3",
    ", we give an approximate formula for the energy loss rate in the case @xmath24 . in this case , the flat spacetime can be adopted as the background spacetime , and we call this approximation the `` flat approximation '' . in sec .  4",
    ", we explain the numerical method for the general value of @xmath32 , where the kerr spacetime is adopted as the background spacetime .",
    "section  5 is devoted to a conclusion . in appendix",
    "a , we describe technical details for computing axion quasibound states around a kerr bh numerically . in appendix",
    "b , we sketch the derivation of the gw radiation rate presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the basic features of the superradiant growth of an axion cloud around a rotating bh and the methods for evaluating the gw radiation rate from this system .",
    "we assume the bh at the center of the axion cloud to be a rotating kerr bh .",
    "a kerr bh is specified by the two parameters , the mass @xmath8 and the angular momentum @xmath36 .",
    "the kerr parameter @xmath37 is introduced by @xmath38 . in this paper",
    ", we often use the nondimensional rotation parameter @xmath39 . in the boyer - lindquist",
    "coordinates @xmath40 , the metric is given by    @xmath41 \\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi^2 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta}dr^2 + \\sigma d\\theta^2 , \\label{metric - kerr - st}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    with @xmath42    the horizon is located at @xmath43 and it rotates with the angular velocity @xmath44 as seen by observers at spatial infinity .",
    "we consider a real scalar field @xmath12 in the kerr spacetime . here , @xmath12 is treated as a test field and its gravitational backreaction is neglected .",
    "because we study the situation much before the bosenova , the effect of the nonlinear self - interaction is less important . for this reason ,",
    "we ignore the nonlinear term and assume @xmath12 to satisfy the massive klein - gordon equation @xmath45 in the kerr spacetime , the separation of variables of the field @xmath12 is possible as @xmath46 throughout the paper , @xmath47 indicates the complexified quantity of a real function @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 . in the following ,",
    "we denote @xmath50 and @xmath51 for simplicity .",
    "see appendix  [ appendix - a ] for the equations that @xmath52 and @xmath53 satisfy .",
    "the superradiant instability occurs only for quasibound states .",
    "such a quasibound state is obtained by assuming the field to decay at infinity and to be ingoing at the horizon .",
    "the procedure is similar to the calculation of the bound states of a hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics . in the case of the hydrogen atom ,",
    "one imposes the wave function to decay at infinity and to be regular at the origin .",
    "then , the energy levels are discretized . in the same manner ,",
    "the frequency @xmath26 is discretized in the case of the bh - axion system .",
    "since there is an ingoing flux at the horizon , the frequency @xmath26 becomes complex , @xmath54 .",
    "the imaginary part gives the exponential behavior , and the field decays for @xmath55 and grows for @xmath56 . in the case",
    "@xmath56 , the bound state is unstable , and this happens when the superradiance condition @xmath57 is satisfied .",
    "physically , the instability happens because the energy density in the neighborhood of the bh horizon becomes negative for @xmath57 , and negative energy falls into the horizon .",
    "then , due to the energy conservation , the amplitude of the outside field becomes larger .",
    "this is the superradiant instability .",
    "approximate solutions for superradiant bound states were constructed in the parameter region @xmath24 by the matched asymptotic expansion ( mae ) method @xcite and in the parameter region @xmath58 by the wkb method @xcite .",
    "the solution in the mae method is closely related to our analysis in sec .",
    "3 . in this method ,",
    "two approximate solutions are constructed in a near - horizon region and in a distant region , and they are matched in the overlapping region where both approximations are valid .",
    "the equation in the distant region is identical to the schrdinger equation for a hydrogen atom except that the electric potential @xmath59 is replaced by the newton potential @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the bh - axion system can be regarded as a huge gravitational atom , which is characterized by the angular quantum numbers @xmath61 and the radial quantum number @xmath62 .     of bound state eigenfrequency as functions of @xmath32 for the bh rotation parameter @xmath63 ( left ) and @xmath64 ( right ) .",

    "[ sec : iv ] , we use these numerical solutions for mode functions of the quasibound states as the source term of gws",

    "however , the time scale of the instability is very long , @xmath101 , and its effect on the gw flux must be small . for this reason ,",
    "we ignore the imaginary part @xmath102 and calculate gws from an oscillating source without exponential growth .",
    "this also means that we ignore the ingoing flux of the field @xmath12 to the bh horizon .",
    "in addition to this , there is another subtlety .",
    "originally , the superradiant unstable mode for @xmath12 is obtained as a complex function @xmath103 proportional to @xmath104 .",

    ", this term can be interpreted as the source for the gw emission by the level transition @xcite . however , for a monochromatic eigenmode of @xmath12 , the stationary terms corresponding to @xmath112 generate only stationary perturbations @xmath92 , and we are not interested in such perturbations .",
    "hence , we neglect this contribution and focus on gws generated by the oscillating terms of eq .  .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to introduce the complexified energy momentum tensor @xmath113 defined by @xmath114 since @xmath113 is proportional to @xmath115 , the frequency @xmath116 and the azimuthal quantum number @xmath117 of gws satisfy @xmath118 hereafter , tilder indicates a quantity for gws .",
    "once a solution for the mode function is given , the gw radiation rate toward null infinity can be calculated by @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the time derivative of a metric perturbation in the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge , and @xmath121 is the area element of the 2-surface in a distant region specified by @xmath122 and @xmath123 . here , the conditions for the tt gauge are @xmath124 and the existence of the tt gauge has been shown for a vacuum perturbation of a vacuum spacetime ( e.g. , p.  186 of ref .",

    "the formula for the energy flux @xmath125 absorbed by the horizon of a kerr bh is derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of the newman - penrose quantity @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",

    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we do not explicitly calculate the gw energy flux across the horizon with the following reason : in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath125 has been shown to be proportional to @xmath128 . as stated in eqs .  , the frequency and the azimuthal quantum number of gws satisfy @xmath129 and @xmath130",

    "first and then find a gauge transformation that puts the solution into the tt gauge .",

    "hence , substituting the expansion formula   in the tt gauge into right - hand side of eq .  , we obtain @xmath177 here , we used the fact that @xmath178 behaves as @xmath179 for large @xmath180 .    furthermore , in spite of the fact that the relation   was derived assuming the tt gauge conditions , the inner product @xmath181 is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath182 with @xmath183 because @xmath184 holds .",
    "this can be shown by rewriting the integral of @xmath185 in the domain @xmath160 into the surface terms by the gauss law and using the absence of the energy flux at the boundaries @xmath163 and @xmath186 .",

    "therefore , similarly to the flat approximation , the axion cloud grows by the superradiant instability until the effect of the nonlinear self - interaction becomes important also when the background spacetime is adopted to be a rotating kerr bh spacetime .",
    "in this paper , we have studied gw emissions from an axion cloud in the superradiant phase around a rotating bh by combining analytic methods and numerical calculations .",
    "first , for @xmath397 for which the newtonian approximation is good , we have derived the analytic formula  in the flat spacetime approximation .",

    "[ gw_rate_mode_l1m1 ] , [ gw_rate_mode_l2m2 ] , and [ gw_rate_mode_l3m3 ] , the results of the numerical calculations indicate that the gw emission rate for each gw mode deviates from the above analytic formula when @xmath401 approaches unity , and rapidly decreases beyond some critical value of @xmath401 due to relativistic effects .",
    "this critical value of @xmath401 depends on the angular momentum parameter @xmath406 and the quantum number @xmath407 characterising the superradiant mode of the cloud and increases with @xmath71 and @xmath407 .",
    "interestingly , up to this critical value , the above analytic formula reproduces the numerical results rather well when @xmath71 is large if the contributions of all emission modes are summed up , although the deviation becomes significant at smaller @xmath401 for @xmath408 .",
    "these gw emission rates were compared with the energy extraction rate by the superradiant instability . when the axion decay constant is in the range @xmath18@xmath409 @xcite and the angular momentum is in the range @xmath63@xmath64 , we have found that the gw emission rate is much smaller than the energy extraction rate except for a small region near the threshold of superradiant instability , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ flat_gw_ac ] , [ ac_gw_l1m1 ] , [ ac_gw_l2m2 ] , and [ ac_gw_l3m3 ] .",
    "therefore , the gw emission does not hinder the growth of the axion cloud through the superradiant instability for a wide range of the system parameters .    in our previous paper  @xcite , we simulated the time evolution of an axion field around a kerr bh taking account of nonlinear self - interaction , and showed that `` axion bosenova '' happens as the result of superradiant instability . our results in this paper indicate that we do not have to change this picture even if we take into account the backreaction of the gw emission from the axion cloud .",
    "since the gw emission rate is sufficiently low , the superradiant instability continues until the bosenova happens by nonlinear self - interaction .    because we can safely declare that bosenova happens",
    ", our next task is to calculate the gw emission _ during _ bosenova . in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we gave a preliminary estimation of the emission rate by the quadrupole formula .",
    "the result can be expressed as @xmath410 where @xmath411 is the change of the axion cloud energy during the bosenova collapse .",
    "@xmath411 includes the energy that falls into bh , which is around @xmath412@xmath413 .",
    "thus , the main difference between the estimation based on the flat approximation and that obtained by the quadrupole formula comes from the numerical coefficient and the power of @xmath401 . here , for small @xmath407 , we have found that @xmath414 is of a similar order to or less than @xmath415 .",
    "the power of @xmath401 for the flat approximation is always larger than that for the quadrupole formula .",
    "hence , the quadrupole formula always gives a larger emission rate than that during the superradiant phase , which is detectable by the advanced ligo , advanced virgo and kagra if the source is inside our galaxy .",
    "this also implies that bosenova can produce strong gw emissions for small @xmath401 if the instability growth time is shorter than the age of the central bh .    in the present paper ,",
    "we have studied the case in which only a single mode grows by superradiance . in realistic situations ,",
    "however , there may exist several unstable modes .",
    "although the instability growth rates for them are largely different , the amplitudes of all of them can become large simultaneously if the instability growth times are all shorter than the age of the bh .",
    "then , gw emissions in the superradiant phase will be more complicated because the emitted gws will be the superposition of those from the two - axion annihilation processes in several bound - state levels and from the process of axion level transitions .",
    "this multi - level occupation will also make the bosenova collapse and the associated gw emissions much more complicated .",
    "further , we should also carefully estimate the detectability of gw emissions in the superradiant phase because it lasts for much longer time than the bosenova collapse .",
    "clearly , gw emissions in such realistic situations can be correctly evaluated only by combining the method developed in the present paper and numerical simulations of bosenova in our previous paper  @xcite .",
