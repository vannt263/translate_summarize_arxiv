    "the spreading of a fluid on a solid substrate depends on the nature of the fluid as well as the substrate and also on other conditions such as temperature and humidity .",
    "though this process is a common everyday experience , details of the spreading mechanism are still incompletely understood .",
    "a small droplet of a liquid , placed on a solid plate will take the shape of a section of a sphere . under equilibrium",
    ", the well known young - laplace relation holds , involving an equilibrium angle of contact @xmath2 . under dynamic conditions",
    "however , while the fluid is spreading , the situation is more complicated .",
    "there are a number of excellent reviews summarizing studies on - the rate of spreading , the forces responsible and other interesting features @xcite . in the present study",
    "we look at a simple extension of the problem - what happens if the fluid is forced to spread beyond its equilibrium area , under an impressed force .",
    "this is close to the ` squeeze film ' problem of chemical engineering@xcite , but usually the squeeze film with constant area is considered , rather than the _ constant mass _ set up we are interested in .",
    "our set up is very simple .",
    "the fluid is sandwiched between two transparent horizontal plates .",
    "a weight is placed on the upper plate . as the fluid spreads",
    ", it is photographed by a video camera , placed below the lower plate .",
    "our observations cover two aspects .",
    "\\(i ) the dynamics : where we find that under different loads the curves for film thickness @xmath3 vs. time show a power - law behavior , where the exponent increases with the load .",
    "\\(ii ) the statics : the area of contact of liquid and plate reaches a more - or - less constant value @xmath4 after some time and the saturated area is plotted against load .",
    "the results presented here are for one water - soluble and one water - insoluble liquid on two different substrates - one low energy and the other with relatively higher energy .",
    "we try to find an explanation for the observed behavior in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the experimental fluids are castor oil and ethylene glycol , insoluble and soluble in water respectively .",
    "a constant volume @xmath5 of the fluid is measured with a micropipette and placed on the lower plate .",
    "the upper plate is then placed on the drop and a load of m kg .",
    "( m = to 15 kg ) is placed on it .",
    "the pair of plates are @xmath6 1 cm thick , one pair is of float glass and the other perspex . a video camera , placed below the lower glass plate records the slow increase in area . the movies are analyzed using image pro - plus software .",
    "@xmath5 is taken as 20 @xmath7 for ethylene glycol and @xmath8 for castor oil .",
    "a larger volume of ethylene glycol spreads to too large areas for our set up and less castor oil does not spread appreciably , hence this choice .",
    "we measure the area @xmath9 and plot area vs. time curves for different loads with different fluid - solid combinations . assuming @xmath5 to be constant the plate separation i.e. film thickness @xmath10 is determined .",
    "video frames are recorded normally at the rate of 4 frames per second until the area becomes more - or - less constant .",
    "however , for a few runs , we record the first 2 - 3 seconds at 10 frames per second to detect the initial plate velocity and its change precisely .",
    "@xmath9 and hence @xmath10 vary in time following a power - law and the exponent @xmath11 is an increasing function of the load @xmath12 .",
    "this is shown in figure([htcp ] ) for castor oil on perspex .",
    "the results give an excellent fit with the exponent varying between 0.14 to 0.25 .",
    "these values are consistent with experiments for spreading without load @xcite reported to be around 0.2 , result known as tanner s law @xcite . for ethylene glycol the exponents cover a wider range , from 0.09 to 0.55 , however the data points are more scattered here and exact values are less reliable .    in general therefore , we have the relation @xmath13    the exponents for castor oil and ethylene glycol on perspex are plotted in figure([exponents ] ) and",
    "show a linear increase with the load .",
    "castor oil being less polar spreads much less on perspex compared to glass , this is shown in figure([psi1 ] ) for a specific @xmath12 .",
    "after recording the dynamics of spreading , we record the area @xmath4 finally attained under a specific load . the area does not reach an absolutely constant value , but continues to increase asymptotically at a very slow rate .",
    "we note the area after an interval of 10 sec . after the load is placed . beyond this time",
    "the increase is very little .",
    "what happens when a loaded plate is placed on a drop of liquid on another plate ? if the initial velocity of the plate is zero , it first gains kinetic energy falling under gravity displacing the viscous liquid .",
    "it loses this energy which is dissipated by the moving liquid .",
    "so the velocity of the plate is expected to rise initially and then fall .",
    "this is actually observed , when the video is recorded at a speed of 10 frames per second .",
    "figure([fit2 ] ) shows clearly that the plate separation falls at a slow rate initially , then faster up to about 0.2 seconds , then falls again to zero .",
    "we follow @xcite in calculating the final area as the load @xmath12 is increased .",
    "let @xmath12 be the total load on the liquid film including the mass of the plate and the weights .",
    "the pressure distribution in the liquid at any instant is shown to be @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the atmospheric pressure outside , @xmath16 the viscosity of the liquid and @xmath5 the constant fluid volume .",
    "@xmath17 is the instantaneous radius of the liquid blob .",
    "we consider squeezing the film under conserved volume condition , in contrast to the constant area condition in @xcite . assuming that the maximum kinetic energy corresponding to the maximum velocity @xmath18 attained ,",
    "is dissipated fully by the viscous liquid as the plate comes to rest , we get the following relation @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid and @xmath21 is the initial area .",
    "graphs of @xmath22 against m in figure([a4 ] ) show that up to 10 kg .",
    "load the curve is indeed a straight line .",
    "after that there is a deviation . in the case of the glass substrate the film becomes too thin to be visible at @xmath23 kg .",
    "we have neglected the energy due to interfacial tension between the different phases and effect of the contact line , in spite of this , the agreement with experiment is pretty good .",
    "in fact for ethylene glycol on perspex , the agreement is quantitative , the calculated coefficient of @xmath12 in equation([area ] ) is 1088 gm/@xmath24 which is quite close to the experimental slope 1492 gm/@xmath24 .",
    "however , when the substrate is glass this agreement breaks down , the calculated result here is approx 9000 gm/@xmath24 , nearly 4 orders of magnitude larger than the experimentally obtained coefficient .",
    "this indicates that since the fluid wets glass , the precursor effect is dominant here @xcite and our naive calculation fails .",
    "the variation of plate separation under different conditions is routinely studied as rheological tests for characterizing soft materials @xcite . however , in that case , the focus is on comparing the behavior of different non - newtonian materials , rather than understanding the physics of the spreading process .",
    "bonn @xcite review several different values of the exponent @xmath25 , observed under different conditions .",
    "the simplest case , where the fluid is a small drop in the form of a spherical cap , balancing the viscous and capillary forces yields @xmath25 = 0.2 @xcite . other values",
    "( generally higher ) are reported , where inertial forces are not negligible .",
    "the effect of varying impressed loads has not been reported to our knowledge .",
    "the linear variation shown in figure([exponents ] ) is interesting and requires closer investigation .",
    "the agreement of experimental @xmath26 as function of @xmath12 , with the simple analysis considering only viscous dissipation is encouraging .",
    "it will be of interest to see what leads to the deviation from this behavior at loads above 10 kg , maybe van der waal interactions start to play a dominating role .",
    "it will also be interesting to analyze the details of the acceleration and deceleration of the plate as seen in figure([fit2 ] ) .    to conclude , the study of thin films under the lubrication approximation is a topic of practical importance in wetting and dewetting problems @xcite and the related problems of adhesion and viscous fingering @xcite .",
    "it is also a phenomenon worth looking into from the point of view of basic science , as it may lead to a better understanding of adhesive and cohesive interactions at the microscopic level .",
