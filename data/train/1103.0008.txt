    "in recent years , a theoretical understanding of the observed pattern of neutrino mixing , i.e. the @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 which links charged - lepton mass eigenstates to neutrino mass eigenstates , has been achieved in terms of non - abelian discrete symmetries . in particular , the tetrahedral symmetry @xmath0  @xcite has been shown to be successful  @xcite in explaining tribimaximal mixing  @xcite , i.e. @xmath12 which is very close to what is experimentally observed . however , a specific testable prediction of this idea is so far lacking .",
    "recently , a model based on @xmath1 and gauged @xmath13 has been shown  @xcite to be testable at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , but it depends on observing the @xmath14 gauge boson , which may be too heavy to be produced . in this paper",
    ", we show that it is not necessary to extend the gauge symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "all one needs is to find a standard - model - like higgs boson @xmath6 whose decay may reveal the residual @xmath3 symmetry , i.e. lepton flavor triality  @xcite , coming from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and possibly other non - abelian discrete symmetries  @xcite . if kinematically allowed , this unusual and easily detectable decay is predicted to be observable at the lhc and perhaps at the tevatron as well . specifically , @xmath4 should be searched for , where @xmath7 is a light scalar with dominant decays to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , resulting thus for example in the easily detectable configuration @xmath17 .",
    "( the idea of using the decay of @xmath6 to two exotic scalars to discover the underlying flavor symmetry has been explored recently  @xcite , using a previously proposed @xmath18 model  @xcite . )    in sec .",
    "ii we reiterate how the notion of lepton triality is realized in the lepton higgs yukawa interactions . in sec .",
    "iii we analyze the general scalar potential of four higgs electroweak doublets transforming as an irreducible triplet plus a singlet of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we show that they share a common solution which is useful for proving lepton triality experimentally . in sec .",
    "iv we obtain all the higgs boson masses in a specific scenario which is also consistent with present phenomenological bounds . in sec .",
    "v we show that the decay @xmath19 has a significant branching fraction for a wide range of @xmath20 values . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss how @xmath6 itself may be observed through lepton triality at the large hadron collider and its discovery reach . in sec.vii",
    "we have some concluding remarks .",
    "the first thing to notice is that if @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 under @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 , the yukawa couplings @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , are of the same form , leading to the charged - lepton mass matrix  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and the condition @xmath28 has been imposed .",
    "note that this condition is not _",
    "ad hoc _ because it corresponds to a residual @xmath3 symmetry and is thus protected against arbitrary corrections .",
    "as first shown  @xcite for @xmath0 , then also recently  @xcite for @xmath1 , this leads naturally to neutrino tribimaximal mixing , provided that the neutrino mass matrix has a special form , which is realized differently for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in either case , as well as that of @xmath2 , the charged - lepton higgs interactions are completely fixed to be the following : @xmath29 \\phi_0 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & v^{-1}[m_\\tau \\bar{l}_\\mu \\tau_r + m_\\mu \\bar{l}_e \\mu_r + m_e   \\bar{l}_\\tau e_r ] \\phi_1 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & v^{-1}[m_\\tau \\bar{l}_e \\tau_r + m_\\mu \\bar{l}_\\tau \\mu_r + m_e   \\bar{l}_\\mu e_r ] \\phi_2 + h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 displaying thus explicitly the important residual @xmath3 symmetry , i.e. lepton triality  @xcite , under which @xmath32    whereas @xmath33 are degenerate in mass , the @xmath34 sector is more complicated . as already shown  @xcite , the mass eigenstates here are not @xmath35 but rather @xmath36 with different masses @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , hence @xmath40 and @xmath41 . as a result of lepton triality ,",
    "the rare decay @xmath42 allows only two possibilities  @xcite @xmath43 and the radiative decay @xmath44 is not allowed .",
    "the present experimental upper limit of the branching fraction of @xmath45 is @xmath46 , implying thus only the bound @xmath47 on the other hand , the @xmath48 gauge boson couples to @xmath49 , i.e. the analog of @xmath50 in the two - higgs - doublet model , hence the condition @xmath51 also applies .",
    "otherwise , @xmath52 would have been detected at lepii which reached a peak energy of 209 gev . in the following",
    ", we will show in detail how @xmath53 may be small enough , say 50 gev , so that @xmath54 and @xmath6 will decay into @xmath55 and be observed .",
    "for each of the three non - abelian discrete symmetries @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there are four higgs doublets to be considered : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we assume that quarks are all singlets , so they couple only to @xmath58 , whereas leptons transform nontrivially and couple to @xmath59 , as already discussed .",
    "the quartic scalar potential of @xmath60 higgs doublets has in general @xmath61 terms . for @xmath62 , without any symmetry , there would be 136 terms .",
    "however , there are only 10 , 7 , and 8 terms respectively for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that a common solution exists for all 3 cases , involving only 5 quartic couplings , which will provide us with the desirable scenario of observable @xmath63 decay .",

    "hence we can look for a desirable solution applicable to all three with nonzero values of @xmath72 and @xmath69 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath73 may also be assumed for simplicity , so our following analysis involves only five quartic couplings .",
    "of course , this may not be the true structure of the correct ( and presumably much more complicated ) model of lepton flavor symmetry , but it is a starting point to demonstrate phenomenologically that this idea can be tested experimentally .",
