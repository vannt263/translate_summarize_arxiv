    "interesting physical properties like structural , transport and magnetic ones have been studied in oxyborates compounds known as warwickites @xcite and ludwigites @xcite .",
    "wigner glass , the existence of a weak ferromagnetism or even charge ordering have been observed in ludwigite materials as consequence of strong electronic correlations and low - dimensional effects .",
    "warwickites are characterized by one - dimensional structures called ribbons where the transition metals are randomly located @xcite .",
    "ludwigites on the other hand , have a crystalline structure that consists of an assembling of subunits .",
    "these subunits are in the form of zigzag walls with four nonequivalent octahedral sites occupied by divalent o trivalent metallic ions @xcite .",
    "warwickites ( q=1 ) and ludwigites ( q=2 ) present the following chemical formula _ @xmath2 _ , where @xmath3 are divalent ( trivalent ) @xmath4 transition - metal ions .",
    "mssbauer experiments suggest that ludwigites , i.e. , the homometallic one @xmath5 can be viewed as formed of two magnetic systems decoupled to first approximation @xcite .",
    "the first one are three - leg - ladders ( 3ll ) consisting of triads of @xmath6-ions with one itinerant electron per rung .",
    "the second one are basically 3ll formed by divalent ions .",
    "these ions neither participate in charge dynamics nor charge ordering .",
    "an antiferromagnetic ( af ) transition at 112k has been observed in 3ll within the fe - ludwigite that basically involves @xmath6 and @xmath7 within the first magnetic system @xcite .",
    "the order is ferromagnetic ( f ) in the rungs and af between the rungs along the ladder @xcite .",
    "the complementary fe - ions are paramagnetic down to 74k .",
    "below 70k all the sample becomes magnetically ordered .",
    "fe - ions in the second magnetic system order f along the ladder and af along the rungs @xcite .",
    "mostly @xmath6-ions order in a weak ferromagnetism where canting of the magnetic hyperfine field for each fe - ion is related to this order @xcite .",
    "a total af state is found below @xmath8 for this fe - ludwigite .",
    "charge ordering at 220k and a structural phase transition at 283k along 3ll ( first magnetic system ) have also been observed by using specific heat measurements @xcite and x - ray diffraction @xcite , respectively .",
    "the structural transition is accompanied by a change in the activation energy of the electrical resistivity @xcite .",
    "below 40k two - dimensional af magnons were proposed to explain the low temperature @xmath9 behavior and disorder ( @xmath6-@xmath7 ) was proposed to explain the large linear term of the specific heat in @xmath10 above 112k @xcite .",
    "transport measurements in fe - ludwigite show activated behavior with two characteristic energies above and below charge ordering at 220k @xcite . theoretical investigation of spin exchange interactions and electronic structure were done using a spin - dimer analysis @xcite and the extended hckel method @xcite , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "an excitonic instability using a tight - binding model was studied in a 3ll @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the important electronic , structural and magnetic correlation was only taken into account till ref .",
    "@xcite , where the low temperature @xmath11 magnetic phase proposed by neutron powder diffraction study was obtained @xcite .    on the other hand , at room temperature , the presence of triads of @xmath12 plus one itinerant electron in 3ll , the crystalline structure , space group , bond lengths and lattice parameters of the only other known homometallic oxyborate co - based ludwigite ( @xmath13 ) are very similar to the previous one @xcite .",
    "these similarities suggest similar behaviors , nevertheless their physical properties are very distinct @xcite . structural transition is not found in the co - ludwigite and only one af transition at 42k is found for the former material @xcite . besides spin - orbit coupling was proposed as a detriment to this peierls transition inhibiting the structural transition for the co - ludwigite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was proposed that orbital moments of co - ions are almost quenched @xcite .",
    "additionally elastic phonon excitations and the role of itinerant electrons in 3ll could be responsible for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 behavior respectively of the specific heat in co - ludwigite .",
    "on the other hand , at high temperature @xmath16 a very complicated thermally activated behavior of the conductivity was found @xcite .    in this",
    "work , structural distortion in 3ll is studied in connection with homometallic ludwigites .",
    "a disorder - based mechanism is proposed and analyzed .",
    "impurities as inifinite repulsion potentials are randomly located in these ladders .",
    "these impurities block itinerant electrons and diminish a structural staggered order parameter , related with structural distortion , as @xmath1 where m is the number of impurities .",
    "this diminution is in detriment of peierls like distortion observed in these ladders as in the case of fe - ludwigite in relationship with co one .",
    "the lack of structural distortion in co - ludwigite is until now not explained .",

    "this mechanism is based in impurities randomly placed in sites coming from @xmath0 localized down - electrons of co - ions .",
    "these impurities block itinerant electrons and are identified as infinite repulsion potentials .",
    "there is always a probability to have static down - electrons in @xmath0-orbitals very near to conduction ones and this effect can produce an interaction with itinerant electrons .    to study structural distortion in 3ll a tight - binding hamiltonian",
