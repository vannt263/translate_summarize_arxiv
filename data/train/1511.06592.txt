    "notwithstanding the impressive progress in the experimental control of genuine quantum systems  @xcite , the reliable storage of quantum information over long times remains a problem of exceptional difficulty  @xcite . among the ideas which have been put forward to solve this issue , proposals based on systems featuring topological order are among the most intriguing  @xcite .",
    "central to these protocols is the encoding of one or more qubits in the degenerate ground states that appear in these models .",
    "protection follows from the fact that such ground states are locally indistinguishable , and the information can be manipulated through some localized boundary modes , which may even feature non - abelian statistics .",
    "due to their experimental relevance , topological superconductors featuring localized and unpaired majorana modes have attracted considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "indeed , several reports accounting for the observation of experimental signatures of zero - energy majorana modes have been recently published  @xcite . at the same time , many proposals have discussed the possibility of observing them in cold atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "the problem of assessing the robustness of quantum information protocols based upon these systems is now becoming of the highest relevance , and several works have already discussed many aspects of the problem  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the following scenario : the experimentalist is able to create and cool a topological superconductor , but can only manipulate the degrees of freedom related to the majorana fermions which appear in the system .",
    "this assumption is motivated by realistic implementation proposals for majorana qubits and quantum memories @xcite , and seems to be the mildest for discussing the near - future developments in the field .",
    "on one hand , experiments on many - body quantum systems have so far shown control over only a limited number of quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "on the other hand , if some quantum information has to be manipulated , it seems inevitable to assume some degree of control over the zero - energy majorana modes ; for the sake of simplicity , here we assume this control to be total .",
    "the upper bounds we derive apply _ a fortiori _ to more realistic situations of limited and imperfect control over the zero - modes .",
    "the question we address is the following : how can one realize a reliable quantum memory in the presence of such constraints ?    assuming that the noise model is local , we explicitly characterize the best recovery operation  @xcite to be applied after the action of noise and determine the associated fidelity , both in general and under the aforementioned constraints . in the latter case , which for clarity we dub _ decoding _ rather than recovery , we present an explicit recipe to be used in experiments in order to achieve the optimal fidelity .",
    "it is worth stressing that in this work we do not consider possible protection operations to be applied during the action of noise , but rather consider noise as given and optimize the read - out .    in order to understand the effect of the experimental limitations , we discuss examples where an appropriate recovery operation acting over the whole topological system can retrieve the encoded information with @xmath0 fidelity even if some form of noise has affected the system .",
    "we show that a limited access to the majorana modes of the system can compromise such possibility but we argue that in such cases information may still be protected by the presence of a significant energy gap in the topological hamiltonian .",
    "while the lack of protection of information in the constrained `` decoding '' case is in line with the general paradigm of quantum error correction , such behavior defies the expectationthat parity preservation should automatically protect information by making the majorana modes immune to errors in the first place , which would make quantum error correction unnecessary .",
    "our study highlights the fact that a control over the whole many - body system is indeed usually necessary .",
    "our study comprises two other additional results which we want to highlight here .",
    "the first is about a topological system immersed in a thermal bosonic environment which induces a markovian dynamics that does not change the parity of the number of fermions of the system .",
    "notwithstanding this requirement , we find that the auto - correlation of a logical pauli operator decays exponentially in time , with a time - scale given by the microscopic details of the system - environment coupling .",
    "the latter result comprises some exact relations for the case of a topological qubit encoded into two fully - decoupled kitaev chains which are perturbed by a noise that conserves the parity of the number of fermions in each chain . in particular , we characterize the maximal amount of information which can still be recovered from the system after the action of the noise , thus generalizing the results in ref .",

    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : enc ] we present some introductory remarks about the encoding of a qubit in a topological system with zero - energy majorana modes . in sec .",

    "the second example is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonic ] , where a master equation for a topological system in a bosonic environment is derived . in both cases , we explicitly compare the optimal recovery fidelity obtained by acting only on the zero modes ( decoding ) to that obtained by acting on the whole system ( full recovery ) . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review some general aspects concerning the encoding of a qubit in majorana zero - modes  @xcite .",
    "we consider a generic topological superconductor with @xmath1 fermionic modes , without any assumption about the setup geometry .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian is quadratic in the fermionic fields , and that the eigenmodes of the hamiltonian include a group of four majorana zero - modes @xmath2 that satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath3 and are localized very far away from one another , enough to make their overlap negligible for all practical purposes .",
    "the remaining fermionic operators are assumed to be arranged in gapped eigenmodes represented by @xmath4 canonical annihilation ( creation ) fermi operators @xmath5 which satisfy @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "sometimes it will be convenient to use the related majorana operators : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "analogously , the majorana zero - modes can be algebraically combined to form non - local dirac zero - modes @xmath10 , @xmath11 . at this level ,",
    "the pairing choice is entirely arbitrary .",
    "a qubit can be stored in a well defined parity sector of the zero - energy two - fermion system , e.g. the two - dimensional space spanned by the logical vectors @xmath12 , @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the vacuum state of the fermionic system : @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "we remark that four majorana modes are necessary to store a non - trivial qubit : with a single pair of majorana modes ( i.e. a single `` bi - localized '' dirac mode ) one can only encode a classical bit , as the fermionic parity superselection rule forbids coherent superpositions of the two degenerate ground states .    denoting by @xmath18 the projector on the ground - space of the system , @xmath19 , our prescription for the qubit encoding yields the following logical operators : @xmath20 which play the role of effective pauli operators for our encoded qubit .",
    "the @xmath21s can be rewritten in a more compact way by introducing the fermionic parity operator @xmath22 for the ground - space , @xmath23 and letting @xmath24 denote the projector onto the even parity sector of the ground space .",
    "then , eq .   re - writes as @xmath25 where @xmath26 commutes with the @xmath27 monomials .",
    "this formalism makes the pauli algebra more evident .",
    "it is worth stressing that the projector can not generally be dropped in the qubit encoding operators @xmath28 : indeed , an initial qubit encoding which goes as @xmath29 _ et cetera _ physically corresponds to a fully mixed ( i.e. , infinite - temperature ) state of the gapped modes , which also has mixed fermionic parity , and is a sub - optimal encoding choice .    from now on",
    "we assume that the experimentalist is able to create one such topological superconductor and to cool it to one of the two ground subspaces with fixed fermionic parity , e.g. @xmath26 .",
    "we further assume that via control over the majorana modes @xmath30 , it is possible to initialize the system in a desired pure state @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . note that we can write @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a function of the zero - modes @xmath35 only .    as already mentioned , here and in the following we neglect the energy splitting which is associated to the overlap of the wavefunctions of the majorana zero - modes @xcite .",
    "this energy splitting has the consequence that the localized majorana modes are not exactly eigenmodes of the system and the logical operators in eq .",
    "evolve in time .",
    "however , since the majorana wavefunction decays exponentially , the energy splitting scales exponentially in the distance between the zero modes , and it can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the system size .",
    "the time - scale associated to the evolution of the logical operators can be made arbitrarily long and in this article we consider the physical situation in which it can be safely neglected .",
    "once the qubit is initialized , the system is set free and noise and perturbations start acting on it .",
    "this drives the setup out of equilibrium by inducing a non - trivial and non - unitary dynamics , which may have disruptive effects on the encoded information . in order to describe these disturbances",
    ", we introduce the decoherence channel @xmath36 , which returns the state of the global system at time @xmath37 : @xmath38 .",
    "the action of @xmath36 includes the coherent evolution ruled by the topological hamiltonian but does not entail any other additional passive protection mechanism . for each value of @xmath37",
    ", @xmath36 is a quantum channel , namely a completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map on the states of the system  @xcite .",
    "this class of linear maps is known to describe the most general physical transformations of quantum states , so that our formalism is completely general .",
    "one additional physical requirement that we pose is that the dynamics must originate from a system - environment interaction that is local in space .    after a time @xmath37 , the experimentalist attempts to `` decode '' the qubit , i.e. to recover the initially encoded information by reading only the four majorana zero - modes .",
    "this limitation is physically relevant , since any protocol that allows the encoding in eq .",
    "implies the ability to control the zero - modes ; on the other hand , a generic global recovery operation may be significantly harder ( or technically impossible ) to carry out .    since the decoding operation can only involve the zero - modes , the full decoherence channel @xmath36 contains much more information than what is necessary for our purposes .",
    "as we shall wee below , we only need to know its restriction to the ground space , @xmath39 , which is obtained by tracing out the gapped modes @xmath40 : @xmath41=\\text{tr}_{\\{\\hat b_i\\ } } \\left [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathcal{d } } } _ t",
    "( \\hat \\rho_0   \\hat \\pi_g ) \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : effdec}\\ ] ] the trace over the gapped modes of an operator @xmath42 can be computed as follows : ( i ) expand @xmath42 over the hilbert - schmidt orthogonal basis given by the monomials @xmath43 in all the majorana modes of the system , defined as follows : @xmath44 where the @xmath45 and @xmath46 coefficients can take values 0 or 1 ; ( ii ) discard the monomials which contain at least one of the @xmath47 ; ( iii ) multiply all the remaining monomials by @xmath48 , which is the trace of the identity operator on the space of states of the gapped @xmath49 modes .",
    "let us now motivate the introduction of the @xmath39 channel .",
    "a general qubit recovery operation is a channel which maps a state of the superconductor @xmath50 to an abstract qubit state ; it generally reads ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath51 \\hat \\sigma_i\\right)\\;.   \\label{eq : recovery}\\ ] ] the qubit is defined in terms of the abstract pauli matrices @xmath52 , @xmath53 and of the identity @xmath54 , while the three coefficients which characterize the components of the bloch vector are related to the measurement of three properly - selected ( hermitian ) observables @xmath55 ( the request that @xmath56 is a cptp map imposes constraints on the @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "the physical constraint that the experimentalist can only manipulate the zero - energy modes @xmath58 translates mathematically into the fact that the @xmath59 can not be generic operators on the whole system ; instead they must be polynomials in the zero - modes only .",

    "leaving for later the discussion on the symmetry of the perturbation , let us here focus on the properties that a noise model should satisfy in order to be considered local .    in order to introduce the concept of locality in our discussion",
    ", we shall consider decoherence channels which satisfy a lieb - robinson bound ( lrb ) for all pairs of fermionic ( i.e. odd - degree monomials in the fermionic fields and combinations thereof ) operators with support in distant regions @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the _ clustering property _",

    "this ideal regime is approached exponentially in @xmath295 , what is usually called an arrhenius activation law  @xcite ; however , we observe that the characteristic energy scale is different depending on whether one has full access to the system or is confined to the zero - modes . once again , most of the information loss observed when acting on the edge modes only would actually be recoverable via a global operation , and only a tiny fraction is fatally lost to the environment .",

    "explicit calculations for two examples of noise models are also presented .",
    "the examples ( a quantum quench in the kitaev hamiltonian and a bosonic thermal environment ) are chosen because in those cases it is possible to prove that a recovery operation acting on the whole system is substantially more effective than a simple decoding of the majorana zero - modes only .",

    "a decoding of the zero - modes does not enjoy any topological protection ( i.e. finite fidelity loss persists even in the ideal infinite - size limit ) , we have highlighted that it benefits from the presence of the hamiltonian energy gap , displaying arrhenius - type behavior .",
