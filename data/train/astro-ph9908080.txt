    "blazars are agns characterized by compact radio core , high and variable radio and optical polarization , superluminal radio components . the continuum emissions are rapidly variable at all frequencies with amplitude of variability increasing with frequency ( see kollgaard 1994 , urry & padovani 1995 and scarp & falomo 1997 ) .",
    "blazars include bl lac objects , optically violently variable quasars ( ovvs ) , highly polarized quasars(hpqs ) , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , and core dominated quasars ( cdq ) .",
    "all those objects are basically the same thing ( fugmann 1989 ; impey et al .",
    "1991 ; valtaoja et al . 1992 ; will et al . 1992 ; scarpa & falomo 1997 ) .",
    "3c279 ( pks 1253 - 055 , 4c-05.55 ) and 4c29.45 ( qso 1156 + 295 , ton 599 ) are members of blazars .",
    "these two objects have some interesting observation properties",
    ". they are qsos showing properties similar to those of a bl lacertae object : large amplitude variation and high and variable polarization .",
    "4c29.45 is classified as a bl lac object ( see fan et al . 1993 and references therein ) , but its line spectrum looks like that of a normal qsos when the continuum is faint ( b @xmath0 18 ) ( wills et al . 1983 ) . 3c279 and 3c 345 occupy the same place as radio selected bl lacertae objects ( rbls ) in the polarization - doppler factor diagram and are more like rbls than qsos ( fan 1998 ) .",
    "before @xmath1-ray observations were available , impey & neugebauer ( 1988 ) found that the infrared emission ( 1 - 100 @xmath2 ) dominate the bolometric luminosities of blazars .",
    "the infrared emissions are also an important component for the luminosity even the @xmath1-ray emissions are included ( von montigny 1995 ) .",
    "the high energetic @xmath1-ray emission mechanism is still an open problem ( see fan et al . 1998a , and references therein ) .",
    "recently , xie et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the high energetic @xmath1-rays are correlated with the near - ir emissions suggesting that the soft photons scattered to the @xmath1-rays region are from the dust .",
    "so , study of the infrared will throw some lights on the understanding of the emission mechanisms in agns .",
    "blazars have been observed in infrared region for more than 20 years .",
    "but there are no available long - term infrared variations in the literature for all these objects . in this paper",
    ", we mainly present the long - term infrared ( j , h , and k bands ) light curves for 3c279 and 4c29.45 and discuss the variation properties because there are more continuous observations in their j , h , and k bands . the paper has been arranged as follows : in section 2 , we present the literature for the data and the light curves ; in section 3 , we discuss them and give a brief conclusion .",
    "infrared observations are available since the 1960s . here",
    "we compiled the data from 22 publications listed in table 1 , which gives the observers in col . 1 . and the telescope(s ) used in col.2 .",
    ".literature and telescopes for the data [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the flux density in the literature has been convected back to magnitude using the original conversion . no dereddening correction was done for the two high galactic latitude ( @xmath3 for 3c279 , @xmath4 for 4c29.45 ) objects .",
    "the measurements were not always made in three bands , generally , there are more measurements in h and k than in j. the light curves are shown in fig .",
    "1a - c , and fig .",
    "2a - c for 3c279 and 4c29.45 , respectively . in the literature , some measurements from 3c279 have relatively large uncertainties ( one point from neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , one from lepine et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and one from impey et al .",
    "( 1984 ) for instance ) .",
    "fig 1(a)-(c ) show that there is good overall agreement in the flux variation .",
    "the largest amplitude variations are @xmath5 = 4.57 , @xmath6 = 4.26 , and @xmath7 = 4.45 for 3c279 and @xmath5 = 3.47 , @xmath6 = 3.82 , and @xmath7 = 3.97 for 4c29.45 .",
    "now , we will analyse the correlations between color index and color index and magnitude as well .",
    "because of the uncertainties in the considered data , straight - line fitting with the uncertainties in both coordinates considered is used to deal with the data .",
    "@xmath8 in principle , @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be determined by minimizing the @xmath11 merit function , i.e. equation ( 15.3.2 ) in the book by press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath15 and @xmath16 uncertainties for the @xmath17th point and @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , the occurrence of @xmath10 in the denominator of above @xmath11 merit function resulting in equation for @xmath19 nonlinear makes the task of fitting very complex although we can get a formula for @xmath9 from @xmath20 , @xmath21 by minimizing the @xmath11 merit function with respect to @xmath10 and using the equation for @xmath9 at each stage to ensure that the minimum with respect to @xmath10 is also minimized with respect to @xmath9 , we can get @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but finding the uncertainties , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in @xmath9 and @xmath10 is more complicated ( see press et al .",
    "so , in the present paper , we only estimated the regression parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 without considering the corresponding uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the data discussed here and in the following section are given simultaneously in the original literature except for a few several - day - averaged points of 3c279 . from the simultaneous observations",
    ", we can get that the averaged color indices are : ( j - h ) = 0.93@xmath240.12 , ( j - k ) = 1.89@xmath240.14 , and ( h - k ) = 0.95@xmath240.09 for 3c279 ; ( j - h ) = 0.84@xmath240.09 , ( j - k ) = 1.74@xmath240.13 , and ( h - k ) = 0.91@xmath240.09 for 4c29.45 . when the straight - line fitting is used to the color indices , ( j - k ) is found associated with both ( j - h ) and ( h - k ) while there is almost no correlation between ( j - h ) and ( h - k ) as found in rbls ( fan & lin 1998 ) .",
    "( j - k ) = 1.6(j - h ) + 0.41 with the correlation coefficient @xmath25 and the probability of the relation happening by chance @xmath26 is almost 0 , ( j - k ) = 2.14(h - k ) - 0.17 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is almost 0 for 3c279 ; ( j - k ) = 1.52(h - k ) + 0.45 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , ( j - k ) = 1.4(h - k ) + 0.48 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 for 4c29.45 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "1d - f and fig . 2d - f .      in agns",
    ", it is found common for the continuous spectrum to change with the brightness of the source , generally , the spectrum flattens when the source brightens but an opposite behaviour is found in some rbls ( see fan & lin 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "but for the spectral index versus flux density correlation , there is a statistic bias ( e.g. massaro & trevese 1996 ) . to avoid this bias",
    ", we discuss the relation between the magnitude in one band and the color index obtained in other two bands .",
    "used the straight - line - fittin , following relations are found for 3c279 : ( h - k ) = 0.04j + 0.44 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , ( j - k ) = 0.08h + 0.92 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is near 0.0 , ( j - h ) = 0.06k + 0.26 with @xmath27 and @xmath35 .",
    "no similar result is found for 4c29.45 ( see fig .",
    "1g - i , fig . 2g - i ) .",
    "blazars are variable at all wavelengths , variation in optical band show some periodicities for those objects with some hundred years optical observations ( see fan et al .",
    "infrared observations have been done more than 20 years , but no long - term variation is available for agns except for the works of neugebeuer et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and litchfield et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , in which they presented infrared observations of about 8-year for some selected objects .",
    "recently , we found that variations in the optical and infrared closely associated for pks 0735 + 178 ( lin & fan 1998 ) and oj287 ( fan et al .",
    "1998c ) indicating these two bands coming from the same mechanism .",
    "but , it is reasonable that other nonvariable or slowly varying near - ir component , such as the stars in the parent galaxy , is present in the spectrum of agns . in this sense , when the source is bright , the spectrum is observed to steepen when the source dims , as expected from a synchrotron component which experiencing radiative energy losses , but when the source dims further , because of the presence of the underlying near - ir emission , the spectrum will flattens with the source getting faint . because the underlying near - ir emission affects j more serious than other two bands , we would expect that there is a clear tendency of spectral flattening with j when j is fainter than a certain magnitude .",
    "3c279 is a well known member of ovvs , a large optical variation of @xmath36 mag ( eachus & liller 1975 ) and a highly optical polarization of @xmath37 ( see scarpa & falomo 1997 ) are reported .",
    "it shows a violently optical brightness increase of 2.0 mag during an interval of 24 hours ( webb et al .",
    "the largest amplitude optical variation is greater than the largest amplitude infrared one .",
    "the straight - line fitting gives a very significant linear correlation between ( h - k ) and j , but fig.1 g indicates that ( h - k ) decreases with j when j is fainter than 14 mag indicating the spectrum flattens when the source dims , but his tendency does not show up obviously in fig . 1h or fig .",
    "the difference between the fitting and the plot is from the faint j points with large error bars , which play a less important role on the fitting .",
    "if we remove the two points with large error bar at the bottom right corner , the tendency is not very clear .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth of noticing and being discussed with more data . if this tendency is real , it is perhaps from the affection of the underlying galaxy as discussed above , and the near - ir spectrum of 3c279 consists of , at least , two components .",
    "the underlying galaxy affects j more serious than h or k , so the tendency appeared in fig .",
    "1 g does not show up clearly in fig .",
    "1h or 1i .",
    "4c29.45 also shows large amplitude variation ( @xmath38 , branly et al .",
    "1996 ) , high and variable polarizations ( @xmath39 , @xmath40=28% , holmes et al .",
    "1984 ; mead et al .",
    "the largest amplitude variations in the infrared are smaller than , but comparable with , that in the optical band .",
    "the infrared light curves show two one - year - separating - double - peaked outbursts with an interval of 3.2 years . during the simultaneous infrared observations",
    ", 4c29.45 showed no significant spectral changing when the source was relative bright ( @xmath41 when the source dimmed by @xmath0 0.9 mag from k = 9.87 faints to 10.76 ) during april 5 - 8 , 1981 .",
    "but the spectral index obtained at the end of april ( @xmath42 ) showed spectral steepening when the source was about 2.5 magnitude fainter than it was on april 5 ( glassgold et al . 1983 ) .",
    "there are no continuous observations between them . from the compiled long - term data , this association is complex and some data ( smith et al . 1987 ) have relatively large uncertainties , @xmath43 , ( see fig .",
    "2g - i ) . from the data",
    ", we found that the largest variation in j is smaller than that in k. the reason is that there are fewer points in j than h and k in the literature . besides",
    ", a weak correlation of ( j - k ) increasing with h ( @xmath44 ) can be obtained . for this object ,",
    "the data are sparse , its variability properties should be discussed with more observations .    for the color indices",
    ", there are correlations between ( j - k ) and ( h - k ) and ( j - h ) as well , but there is almost no correlation between ( j - h ) and ( h - k ) .",
    "we think the reasons are perhaps due to the facts that ( 1 ) ( j - k ) has wider distribution than ( j - h ) and ( h - k ) so that ( j - h ) and ( h - k ) concentrate in a narrow region diluting the correlation , and ( 2 ) the spectrum deviates from the power law ( fan et al . 1998d ) .    we have compiled the infrared light curves for 3c279 and 4c29.45 , largest amplitude variation , color - color relation and color - magnitude relation are investigated .",
    "the largest variation in the infrared is smaller than that in the optical band , ( j - k ) is strongly associated with ( j - h ) for the two objects while color - magnitude relation is only found for 3c279 , the ( h - k)-j plot suggests that the spectrum of 3c279 consists of , at least , two components .",
    "no similar results are found for 4c29.45 .",
