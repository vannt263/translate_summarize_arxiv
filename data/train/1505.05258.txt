    "the heavy ion collisions at relativistic energy are the means to produce a large volume of hot / dense matter required to create and characterize such a phase  @xcite .",
    "the quark gluon matter presumably with local thermal equilibrium expands hydrodynamically and undergoes a phase transition to hadronic matter which further cools till the multiple scatterings among particles are sufficient to keep them as one system .",
