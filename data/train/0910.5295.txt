    "according to the supernova observations @xcite , our universe has an accelerating expansion at present epoch @xcite . accepting general relativity theory as the underlying theory for describing the dynamics of the universe , there is a missing energy - momentum component of the universe , dubbed `` dark energy '' @xcite , providing the present acceleration .",
    "there are several candidate for such a dark energy , cosmological constant , chaplyian gas , quintessence and so on ( see ref @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some cosmological models involve an interaction between dark matter and dark energy @xcite .",
    "this removes the need for a fine - tuned cosmological constant to get the ratio of dark matter to dark energy of order unity nowadays .",
    "this is widely known as coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "a particular class of these models is brans - dicke ( bd ) type scalar field model .",
    "one can deal with bd scalar field model in two frames,``jordan frame '' and `` einstein frame '' . in jordan frame",
    ", the the scalar field does not appear in the action of matter fields but couples non - minimally to gravity .",
    "it is possible to make a particular conformal transformation , converting the theory to a scalar - tensor model in which the scalar field couples conformally to matter and minimally to gravity . describing the scalar field as quintessence",
    ", hereafter we shall refer to this model as conformally coupled quintessence model ( ccq ) .",
    "there has been a lot of discussion about the choice of one of these frames as the physical frame @xcite .",
    "here we pay our attention to the einstein frame .",
    "this frame is a suitable framework to make the model consistent with the solar system constraint and further observational constraints from big - bang nucleosynthesis and inflation @xcite .    following",
    "caldwell and linder @xcite , the scalar field models of quintessence can be divided into two categories , called `` freezing '' and `` thawing '' models . in the former ,",
    "the equation of state parameter has a decreasing behavior but in the latter , it has a value near @xmath0 initially , and then increases with time to less negative values .    in @xcite , it is shown that non - interacting thawing quintessence model with nearly flat potentials ( the potentials satisfying the slow - roll conditions : @xmath1 ) provides a natural way to produce a value of @xmath2 near @xmath0 today .",
    "generalizing this to ccq model with nearly flat potentials @xcite , shows that there exists a universal behavior for @xmath2 which is different from thawing behavior initially . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "some conditions on the potential of the scalar field are derived which is different from the slow - roll conditions initially and lead to the thawing behavior for all times .    on the other hand as demonstrated in refs.@xcite , it is possible to discriminate different models of dark energy from each other by some parameters , called the statefinder parameters @xmath3 , firstly proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first of these , @xmath4 , is the jerk parameter and the other is a function of jerk and the decelerating parameters .",
    "the statefinder pair depends on the metric of space - time and is constructed using the second and third derivatives of the scale factor as : @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the deceleration parameter .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss further the nearly flat and thawing ccq models of dark energy by statefinder diagnostic . in the next section",
    ", we will start with bd interacting dark energy model . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "application of some conditions on the potential , nearly flat and thawing conditions , leads to an analytical expression for @xmath2 in any case . then",
    ", we apply the statefinder diagnostic to ccq model in section 3 . in the last section we will give some conclusions . throughout this work we have chosen the units @xmath8 .",
    "the general action of bd scalar tensor theory in the jordan frame is : @xmath9.\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the potential of the scalar field , @xmath13 is the bd coupling constant and @xmath14 is the matter lagrangian . under the conformal transformation @xmath15 , in which @xmath16 and @xmath17 , one arrives at the action of bd theory in the einstein frame : @xmath18.\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .    now , consider a spatially flat frw universe occupied by the pressureless matter .",
    "the cosmological equations of motion are : @xmath20 @xmath21\\ ] ] and the scalar field evolution is governed by the following equation of motion : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the energy density of cosmic fluid , the energy density and pressure density of the scalar field in the einstein frame respectively and @xmath26 . from equation ( [ scalar field ] ) , one can easily see that the energy density of the scalar field satisfies the following conservation law : @xmath27 in which @xmath28 is the equation of state parameter for the scalar field . combining the above equations , the continuity equation for the cosmic fluid",
    "can be derived as : @xmath29 by integrating equation ( [ rhomdot ] ) , one obtains : @xmath30 in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the current values of the matter density , the scale factor and the scalar field respectively .",
    "therefore the usual dependence of the non - relativistic matter upon the scale factor is modified by an exponential factor due to the interaction with the scalar field .    taking the time derivative of @xmath33 and using the continuity equation ( [ rhophidot ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xcite : @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the density parameters of matter and the scalar field respectively ( @xmath37 and prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath38 .. ignoring the interaction of the scalar field and the cosmic fluid , this equation reduces to the corresponding equation of steinhardt et al .",
    "@xcite for a non interacting scalar field .",
    "following the same method as refs @xcite , using the relation @xmath39 , the continuity equation ( [ rhophidot ] ) reads as @xcite : @xmath40 which is a useful relation to derive the redshift dependence of the cosmological quantities in the next section .",
    "moreover by using equation ( [ rhom ] ) , one can express equations ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ friedmann1 ] ) in the following form , convenient for the construction method proposed by @xcite : @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is the redshift parameter and @xmath45 is the present scale factor of the universe .",
    "these are two coupled equations allowing one to reconstruct the potential @xmath46 and the scalar field @xmath47 knowing @xmath48 , @xmath49 and also using the observed @xmath50 from the luminosity distance .",
    "since the left hand side of equation ( [ res ] ) is non - negative , the dynamical expansion of the universe is restricted by the following inequality : @xmath51 this is the weak energy condition for bd cosmology in the einstein s frame .",
    "we see that although it is not possible to express the hubble parameter as an explicit function of the cosmological redshift in this model , there is a necessary condition on the @xmath50 in this case . ignoring the interaction and thus the exponential factor , inequality ( [ ineq ] )",
    "reduces to what is derived by sahni and starobinsky in @xcite for non interacting case .",
    "according to the previous section , using bd theory of gravity in the einstein s frame leads to a scalar - tensor theory in which there is a particular interaction between the non - relativistic matter and the scalar field .",
    "it is a well known fact that the coupled scalar field model with @xmath52 ( called usually interacting quintessence ) has the capability of explaining the current cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "however to make these models acceptable , some limitations on the form of @xmath53 has to be set , depending on the form of the interaction term @xcite .    in @xcite , the necessary conditions for the existence of thawing behavior for ccq model is found .",
    "assuming thawing behavior , the following relation , called thawing condition , should be satisfied @xcite : @xmath54 which shows that it is necessary that @xmath55 increases with time when @xmath56 and @xmath36 are increasing functions .",
    "dividing equation ( [ v1 ] ) by equation ( [ z ] ) , one arrives at a differential equation for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "replacing @xmath55 with expression ( [ co ] ) and retaining terms to the lowest order in @xmath57 ( @xmath2 is near @xmath0 ) , the differential equation of @xmath2 is exactly solvable .",
    "the resulting analytical expression expression for the state parameter is as follows @xcite : @xmath58 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a positive constant , @xmath60 is an integration constant , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that in the case of ccq model , @xmath55 neither is a small value nor is a constant .",
    "therefore the nearly flat potentials do not lead to the thawing behavior .",
    "however recently , study of the behavior of the equation of state parameter for nearly flat potentials has attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown that the equation of state parameter firstly increases with time and then approaches asymptotically to a value near to @xmath0 . as mentioned in @xcite , assuming the slow - roll conditions for the potential , one can show that @xmath63 which ensures that @xmath55 is approximately constant up to now , i.e. @xmath64 where @xmath59 is a small constant evaluated at the initial value of @xmath32 . combining equations",
    "( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ z ] ) and making two assumptions , the first one is that @xmath2 is near @xmath0 and the second is that the condition ( [ con ] ) is satisfied , these yield again to a differential equation for @xmath2 as a function of @xmath36 @xcite which gives the following analytical expression for the equation of state parameter : @xmath65 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath66 in which @xmath67 is some small initial value of @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .    from equations ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ friedmann1 ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the deceleration parameter takes the following form as : @xmath70 after differentiating equation ( [ friedmann1 ] ) , using relations ( [ rhophidot ] ) and ( [ rhomdot ] ) , one finds : @xmath71 inserting ( [ q ] ) and ( [ r ] ) in ( [ s ] ) gives : @xmath72 which explicitly depends on @xmath36 in contrast to the non - interacting quintessence .",
    "let us now have a detailed look at how the statefinder parameters behave for thawing and nearly flat ccq model of dark energy . as we have seen before , in these cases ,",
    "it is possible to derive an analytical expression for the statefinder pairs as a function of the density parameter of the scalar field , @xmath73 , without considering a special form for the potential . to do this",
    ", one can use the relation ( [ v1 ] ) , the thawing condition ( [ co ] ) and the analytical expression of @xmath2 , equation([ome ] ) , for the case of thawing ccq model and the corresponding relations ( [ v1 ] ) , ( [ con ] ) and ( [ omeg ] ) in the case of nearly flat ccq model .",
    "the time evolution of the statefinder pairs @xmath3 for thawing ccq model has been shown in figure [ thaw1 ] with @xmath74 .",
    "this value of @xmath59 is chosen such that @xmath2 has a value near @xmath0 today .",
    "also the constant @xmath60 is chosen such that the initial condition @xmath75 holds for @xmath76 and @xmath77 has been set equal to @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 ( @xmath80-cold dark matter ) universe corresponds to the fixed point @xmath81 .",
    "we see that the evolution of trajectories of statefinders pairs pass from the point @xmath82 in the past when @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "and then after passing @xmath85 fixed point , @xmath4 decreases whereas @xmath86 increases to the point @xmath87 at @xmath88 @xmath89 in the future .",
    "the location of today s point is @xmath90 when @xmath91 .",
    "this shows the present distance of thawing ccq model of dark energy from @xmath85 model .",
    "the time evolution of the pairs @xmath92 is indicated by figure [ thaw2 ] .",
    "the dashed , thick and thin curves have @xmath93 respectively .",
    "we see that both @xmath85 and thawing ccq models start evolving from the same point , @xmath94 which corresponds to scdm ( standard cold dark matter ) universe . in @xmath85 scenario ,",
    "the evolution is along a horizontal line ends at ss ( steady - state ) fixed point , @xmath95 , corresponding to de sitter expansion .",
    "however in our model , @xmath96 has a decreasing behavior whereas the value of @xmath4 first increases and then monotonically decreases .",
    "the trajectory goes to @xmath97 at @xmath98 in the future .    in figures [ thaw4 ] and [ thaw5 ] ,",
    "we have shown the deceleration parameter and the equation of state parameter as functions of redshift parameter .",
    "these figures have been plotted numerically using the relations ( [ z ] ) , ( [ ome ] ) and ( [ q ] ) .    in figure [ flat1 ]",
    "we have shown time evolution of the statefinder pairs for nearly flat ccq model of dark energy with @xmath99 .",
    "this small value of @xmath59 ensures that the variation of the potential during the evolution of the universe is very small .",
    "assuming that for an initial value of @xmath100 , say @xmath67 , @xmath101 , we have @xmath75 .",
    "this determines the constant @xmath102 in the relation ( [ omeg ] ) setting @xmath103 here .",
    "the @xmath3 trajectory has two branches .",
    "we find that the first branch comes asymptotically from @xmath104 , @xmath105 goes to @xmath106 , @xmath107 for a change of @xmath100 in the interval @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "another branch comes along @xmath106 asymptote , passes from @xmath85 point and then goes to @xmath109 at @xmath98 ( @xmath110 ) in the future .",
    "the divergent behavior and discontinuity of @xmath86 occurs at @xmath111 and is due to vanishing @xmath2 at this point .",
    "along the first branch , both @xmath4 and @xmath86 are increasing , however for the other branch @xmath4 monotonically decreases whereas @xmath86 increases .",
    "the location of today s point is @xmath112 when @xmath91 .",
    "this shows that this model has less distance from @xmath85 model in comparison to thawing model .",
    "this result is satisfied in both models independent of the allowed chosen value of @xmath59 .",
    "the evolutionary track in @xmath92 plane is shown in figure [ flat2 ] .",
    "the tick and thin curves are corresponding to @xmath99 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "it is started from scdm point as the same as the @xmath85 evolutionary path , but first @xmath4 decreases and @xmath96 increases slightly , then after passing a period in which @xmath4 and @xmath96 have increasing behavior , those decreases monotonically .",
    "this period corresponds to very high redshift .",
    "the trajectory goes to @xmath114 at @xmath115 ( @xmath110 ) in the future . at the end",
    ", we present the plot of @xmath96 and @xmath2 with respect @xmath116 .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the statefinder diagnostic to the ccq model of dark energy .",
    "and we have plotted the trajectories in the @xmath3 , @xmath92 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for nearly flat and thawing potentials .",
    "as it is apparent from figures [ thaw4 ] and [ flat4 ] , the deceleration parameter decreases monotonically with redshift for both the nearly flat and thawing potentials , however it goes to more negative values at future in the case of nearly flat model .",
    "moreover nearly flat potentials force the equation of state parameter changes in a wide range with redshift whereas it remains near @xmath0 for thawing model , as one expected .",
    "this is exactly what one finds from figures [ thaw5 ] and [ flat5 ] .",
    "also the value of @xmath4 decreases with redshift steadily for both kinds of potentials as well as non - interacting quintessence model @xcite .",
