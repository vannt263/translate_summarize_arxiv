    "sensitivity increase of gravitational wave detectors like advanced virgo and ligo is expected to be obtained by rising the value of power stored in the fabry - perot(fp ) resonator optical mode .",
    "however , high values of circulating power may be a source of the nonlinear effects which will prevent from reaching the projected sensitivity .",
    "it is appropriate to remind that nonlinear coupling of elastic and light waves in continuous media produces mandelstam - brillouin scattering .",
    "it is a classical parametric effect ; it is often explained in terms of quantum physics : one quantum @xmath2 of main optical wave transforms into two , i.e. , @xmath3 in the additional optical wave ( stokes wave : @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 in the elastic wave so that @xmath6 .",
    "the irradiation into the anti - stokes wave is also possible ( @xmath7 ) , however , in this case the part of energy is taken from the elastic wave .",
    "the physical mechanism of this coupling is the dependence of refractive index on density which is modulated by elastic waves .",
    "if the main wave power is large enough the stimulated scattering will take place , the amplitudes of elastic and stokes waves will increase substantially .    in gravitational wave detectors elastic oscillations in fp resonator mirrors",
    "will interact with optical ones being coupled parametrically due to the boundary conditions on the one hand , and due to the ponderomotive force on the other hand .",
    "two optical modes may play roles of the main and stokes waves .",
    "high quality factors of these modes and of the elastic one will increase the effectiveness of the interaction between them and may give birth to the parametric oscillatory instability which is similar to stimulated mandelstam - brillouin effect .",
    "this undesirable effect of parametric oscillatory instability may create a specific upper limit for the value of power @xmath8 circulating inside the cavity@xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the effect of parametric instability is important not only for large scale gravitational - wave interferometers .",
    "recently , the instability produced by optical rigidity was observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "k. vahala with collaborators has also observed it in micro scale whispering gallery optical resonators @xcite .",
    "zhao et al.@xcite have shown in experiment , using an 80 m fabry - perot cavity , that parametric instability effect can indeed occur .",
    "the experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "the condition of parametric instability for fabry - perot cavity may be written in simple form@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a speed of light , @xmath11 is a distance between the fp mirrors , @xmath12 is a mirror s mass , @xmath13 are the relaxation rates of elastic and stokes modes correspondingly , @xmath14 is a power circulating inside the cavity , @xmath15 is an overlapping factor of elastic and optical modes and @xmath16 is a detuning value . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the functions of the distributions over the mirror surface of the optical fields in the main and stokes optical modes correspondingly , vector @xmath19 is the spatial vector of displacements in elastic mode , @xmath20 is the component of @xmath19 , normal to the mirror s surface , @xmath21 corresponds to the integration over the mirror surface and @xmath22  over the mirror volume @xmath23 .    as we can see from formula (",
    "[ 00 ] ) the parametric instability is a threshold effect and it takes place if optical power @xmath14 in main mode of fabry - perot cavity is bigger than the threshold power @xmath8 .",
    "the value @xmath8 depends on the detuning @xmath24 between optical and elastic modes and overlapping factor @xmath15 , in particular , the @xmath8 has minimum if detuning is less than relaxation rate of stokes mode @xmath25 and overlapping factor is large enough",
    ".     may not have suitable anti - stokes mode ( it is denoted by question - mark).,width=340 ]    analyzing this equation dambrosio and kells @xcite pointed out that the presence of the anti - stokes mode can considerably depress or even exclude parametric instability .",
    "indeed , the condition of parametric oscillatory instability in the presence of anti - stokes mode with frequency @xmath7 has the following form@xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a relaxation rate of anti - stokes mode and @xmath28 is a detuning value .    for example , let the main , stokes and anti - stokes modes be equidistant and belong to the main frequency sequence @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31(k is an integer ) . in this case",
    "@xmath32 , the main , stokes and anti - stokes modes have the same gaussian distribution over the cross section and hence the same overlapping factors : @xmath33 .",
    "it means that the second term in the right part of equation is larger than first term , the positive damping introduced into elastic mode by the anti - stokes mode is greater than negative damping due to the stokes mode , hence the parametric instability is impossible .",
    "this case has been analyzed in details in @xcite .",
    "for the case when the stokes and anti - stokes modes do not belong to the main sequence ( non - zero radial @xmath34 and azimuth @xmath35 numbers ) the frequencies of the suitable stokes and anti - stokes modes are not equidistant from the main mode ( @xmath36 ) and have different spatial distributions ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "it takes place when main mode is @xmath0 and fig .",
    "[ modes ] illustrates it .",
    "for the shown stokes mode ( left to the main mode ) there is no suitable anti - stokes mode ( it should be located right to the main one ) .",
    "the probability that appropriate anti - stokes mode exists is extremely small and we see that in this case full depression of parametric instability does not take place .",
    "however , when main mode has non - zero radial and azimuth numbers(high order laguerre - gauss modes @xmath38 ) the possibility of parametric instability depression by existence of suitable anti - stokes mode will increase .",
    "parametric instability is a serious problem for advanced gravitational wave detectors and we need to know this  enemy  in detail to avoid it . in particular , we need detailed information about pairs of stokes modes and elastic modes which may be possible candidates for parametric instability .",
    "it is known that stokes and anti - stokes modes may be analytically calculated for gaussian beams .",
    "in contrast , elastic modes may be calculated numerically(some method of analytical elastic modes calculation has been proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the accuracy of parametric instability forecast ( and success of methods to prevent it ) directly depends on how accurately we can calculate normal ( eigen ) frequencies and spatial distributions of elastic modes .",
    "using ansys@xmath39 code , for example , we can obtain the accuracy of elastic modes calculations of about 0.5@xmath40 or poorer@xcite .    in @xcite the importance of accurate numerical calculation of elastic modes in the mirrors of advanced ligo",
    "was discussed to enable precise predictions of the problem of parametric oscillatory instability . in @xcite",
    "it has been proposed accuracy estimations through use of analytical solutions based on chree - lamb modes .",
    "small deviations from cylindrical test mass shape may produce splitting of non - axial symmetric elastic modes into doublets .",
    "this splitting may increase the possibility of parametric oscillatory instability too@xcite .",
    "it is known the important goal in gravitational wave detectors is to minimize fundamental and technical noise contribution .",
    "for example , progressive way to lower the thermal noise is to change the mode shape of the laser beam inside the interferometer .",
    "it is worth noting that different shapes of beam have been proposed for reducing thermal noise such as mesa beams @xcite , conical modes @xcite and high order laguerre - gauss modes@xcite . at present ,",
    "there are some techniques for the generation of high order lg modes using holograms@xcite , gratings@xcite and mode transformers@xcite with high conversion efficiency@xcite . in @xcite using numerical interferometer simulations the comparison of behaviour of the @xmath1 mode with the fundamental mode @xmath0 are discussed .",
    "the @xmath1 mode performs similar if not even better than commonly used @xmath0 for all considered aspects of interferometric sensing .    in this letter",
    "we estimate the possibility of parametric instabilities in fabry - perot cavity of advanced virgo and ligo interferometers both for gauss @xmath0 and laguerre - gauss @xmath1 modes as a carriers@xcite . in section [ results ] we provide estimations of pi in fabry - perot cavity of advanced virgo and ligo interferometers and discuss our results , in section [ conclusion ] we make some useful conclusions for future research .",
    "in order to predict the unstable combinations of stokes and elastic modes we have to take into account the additional azimuth numbers condition of parametric instability .",
    "for example , for @xmath0 as a carrier ( when the elastic modes have azimuth dependence @xmath41 and stokes modes have - @xmath42 ) the non - zero overlap factor will be if @xmath43(see the formula ( [ o ] ) for @xmath15 ) . in turn , if we use @xmath1 as a carrier the non - zero overlap factor will be if @xmath44 .",
    "it is worth noting that it is correct only if cylinder center coincides with laser spot center and below we consider this particular case(in opposite case the overlap factor has to depend on distance between the center of mirror and center of main optical mode distribution over mirror surface ) .",
    "for fabry - perot cavity we use the parameters of advanced virgo and ligo interferometers shown in table [ table4 ]    .parameters of advanced ligo and virgo interferometers [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this letter we deduced the analysis of parametric oscillatory instability in fp cavities of gravitational wave detectors like advanced ligo and virgo in the model with cylindrical mirrors without flats and suspension ears .",
    "the main goal of our estimations was to compare a difference in @xmath45 behavior between advanced ligo and virgo fabry - perot cavities for parametric instabilities in such simple model .",
    "the number of obtained unstable modes for @xmath1 case is slightly larger than for @xmath0 case in elastic modes frequency range up to 40khz , however , this difference is not large enough to conclude that @xmath1 case is more dangerous than @xmath0 case .",
    "no doubts , there is necessity to perform detailed analysis for full scale schemes of advanced ligo and virgo in @xmath1 case with wide elastic modes frequency range , very high accuracy of elastic modes calculations@xcite and mirror flats and ears .    at the end of the letter we would like to summarize some dangerous points that must be taken into account at present and in future parametric instability research .",
    "it is worth noting that for combinations of modes suitable for parametric instability the overlapping factor @xmath15 may be zero ( for example , elastic mode and the stokes mode can have different dependence on azimuth angle )  we did not mention such combinations in our estimations .",
    "however , it is important to take into account that only the elastic mode is attached to the mirror axis in contrast to the optical mode which can be shifted from the mirror axis due to non - perfect optical alignment .",
    "hence , the overlapping factor has to depend on distance @xmath46 between the center of mirror and the center of the main optical mode distribution over the mirror surface .",
    "it means that @xmath15 may be zero for @xmath47 but non - zero for @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the numerical analysis of the mode structure should evidently include the case when @xmath48 .",
    "note that there is a proposal to use special shift @xmath46 of the laser beam of about several centimeters from the mirror axis in order to decrease thermal suspension noise @xcite .",
    "imperfections from the cylinder shape ( such as flats and suspension ears ) , should cause splitting of elastic modes with azimuth index @xmath49 into doublets and the difference between doublet frequencies may be large enough or greater as compared with relaxation rate of stokes mode .",
    "both the appearance of doublets and high density of elastic modes may increase the possibility of parametric instability in advanced virgo and ligo@xcite .    the effect of parametric instability for power recycled interferometer may be larger than for the separate fabry - perot cavity because the stokes mode emitted from the fabry - perot cavity throughout its input mirror is not lost irreversible but returns back due to power recycling mirror , therefore , its interaction is prolonged@xcite . as it was demonstrated in @xcite",
    "the presence of power recycling cavity causes parametric gains @xmath50 to be hugely amplified at @xmath51 and reduced by a factor of 2 in off - resonance intervals as compared to an interferometer without power recycling .",
    "the detailed analysis of parametric instability in signal recycled interferometer has been realized in @xcite . on the other hand , the parametric instability in the interferometer with power recycling mirror may be depressed by variation of distance between power recycling mirror and beam splitter@xcite .",
    "detail analysis of parametric instability in full scale advanced ligo interferometer has been performed in@xcite and it will be useful to present the same analysis for @xmath1 case in future researches .",
    "we think that parametric oscillatory instability effect can be overcome in laser gravitational detectors after developing strategies for its suppression using these investigations .",
