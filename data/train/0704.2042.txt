    "it is common to consider the problems of big bang cosmology , such as the horizon problem , to be cured by having a period of inflation .",
    "a positive cosmological constant would give inflation , but we also need the period of inflation to have a natural end . the simplest way to do this is to have a scalar field slowly rolling in a potential , with a minimum in which we sit today .",
    "one problem with a big bang type initial singularity is that the laws of physics break down at the singularity , and we therefore know little about the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "however , a theory of the universe which is only a theory of evolution can never be complete - it would mean that we would have to guess at the initial conditions . in order to have a complete theory",
    "we will also need a theory of the initial state of the universe .",
    "the no boundary proposal of hartle and hawking  @xcite is the theory of initial conditions we shall choose to work with .",
    "the potential may be very complicated and have numerous valleys and hill tops .",
    "we will work with the top - down cosmology approach , and so we constrain the universe to start some way off the minimum in which reheating happens , in order that we get a large enough density . in this paper",
    "we will consider a hill where the conditions imposed through top - down cosmology are such that the universe starts somewhere close to the top of the hill ; in this case , we will ask whether the universe in fact starts in an unstable de - sitter state at the top of the hill . we will consider a broad potential , with @xmath0 at the top of the hill , so that we are considering either a hawking - moss instanton or a hawking - turok instanton ;",
    "coleman - de luccia instantons  @xcite do not arise in this case .",
    "the instantons are selected by prescribing appropriate quantities on their boundary . in the past",
    ", numerous authors have considered the problem in the minisuperspace by prescribing the scalar field @xmath1 and the scale factor @xmath2 on the boundary of the instanton .",
    "instead we will prescribe @xmath1 and the trace of the second fundamental form @xmath3 on the boundary of the instanton .",
    "our approach is in keeping with top down cosmology  @xcite and the expansion of the universe .",
    "there are many papers which consider instantons which are composed of a real euclidean section , and a real lorentzian section , analytically joined together ; and there are a number of authors who consider fully complex instantons . here",
    "we will consider fully complex instantons . in order to calculate the probability of a given instanton",
    ", we will need to calculate its action .",
    "we will be comparing the actions for the hawking moss instanton with the hawking turok instanton .",
    "since we are only considering a comparison for hawking turok instantons close to the top of the hill , we can address the question with a perturbation calculation ; and we expect to have to calculate the action of the hawking turok instanton to second order in the perturbation parameter was also considered and , as in this work , the solution for the scale factor and scalar field were computed in an expansion in the initial displacement of the scalar field from the potential maximum .",
    "there however , the scale factor was not consistently corrected to second order ; this we shall rectify here .",
    "the resulting extra contributions to the action are responsible for the difference of our result from theirs . ] .",
    "this is what we proceed to do in the next section .",
    "we will also see that is is sufficient to perform a second order perturbation calculation .",
    "the euclidean action for a real scalar field plus gravity is @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the no - boundary manifold and @xmath7 is its boundary ( a copy of @xmath8 ) . the boundary term is chosen to be appropriate to the variational problem where @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath9 are held fixed on the boundary ( here @xmath10 is the metric on a unit @xmath8 ) .",
    "this boundary term is different from the case where @xmath2 is fixed on the boundary . using the resulting equation of motion , @xmath11 ,",
    "this becomes @xmath12 we will take the potential to be @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 because we are interested in considering a hill top with positive potential ; and @xmath16 so that the hill top is broad enough ( @xmath0 ) for us not to get a coleman - de luccia instanton  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we will only be interested in the region around the top of the hill , so it is not a problem that our potential is unbounded below , and nor is it a problem that our potential does nt feature a minimum .",
    "we consider the homogeneous @xmath17 symmetric case where the metric in the euclidean region is @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in particular we consider the homogeneous perturbation from the hawking - moss instanton .",
    "we take the perturbation parameter to be the value of @xmath1 at the regular pole of the hawking - turok instanton : @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the conditions for @xmath25 to be the regular pole of the instanton are @xmath26    setting @xmath27 , the classical constraint equation is @xmath28 and the classical equations of motion for the euclidean metric are @xmath29 these tell us that @xmath1 is odd in @xmath30 while @xmath2 is even .",
    "thus by finding @xmath31 and @xmath32 we may calculate the action to second order in @xmath30 ( and since the question is whether there is a local maximum in the probability for nucleation at the top of the hill , this is all that is necessary ) .",
    "the solution is @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; and @xmath36 we can approximate ( [ problemintegral ] ) by approximating @xmath37 by a truncated series in @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 in ( [ problemintegral ] ) would give @xmath40 h \\tau cos(h \\tau ) \\\\ \\nonumber & -5 [ 32 + 36 c + 27 c^{2 } - 9 c ( 4 + 3 c ) h^{2 } \\tau^{2 } + 9 c^{2 } h^{4 } \\tau^{4 } ] sin ( h \\tau ) \\big)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the expression ( [ general_action ] ) for the action we have @xmath41    we are using @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this gives @xmath44 we define @xmath45 to be such that @xmath46 ; then @xmath47 with ( from ( [ kequation ] ) ) : @xmath48    from ( [ action_in_terms_of_b ] ) we have @xmath49 where we have used @xmath50 to give the series in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "first we consider the action for the hawking - moss instanton : from ( [ action_in_terms_of_b ] ) we see this is @xmath53 we see that this has branch cuts extending from @xmath54 along the imaginary euclidean @xmath52 axis away from the origin - thus it does nt make any sense to try to extend from the real line beyond these values when we are considering the case of the hawking - moss instanton .",
    "it is easy to see the cause of this problem : consider equation ( [ constraint ] ) ; analytically continuing this to lorentzian time shows that lorentzian @xmath52 is bounded by @xmath55 .",
    "considering this same equation we see that for hawking turok instantons near the top of the hill with roughly constant @xmath1 throughout ( these are the instantons arising in the perturbation calculation ) we have a small upper bound on @xmath56 so the upper bound on lorentzian @xmath52 only moves at second order in a perturbative expansion in @xmath30 .",
    "thus we can expect that the branch cuts in the action do nt move at first order .",
    "also , if we wish to compare hawking turok instantons near the top of the hill with hawking moss instantons at the top of the hill then we can only consider the range of @xmath52 applicable to both : i.e. lorentzian @xmath52 with @xmath57 .",
    "fixing @xmath58 and @xmath59 and performing the calculations one can show that the results for @xmath60 are independent of the truncation at a given @xmath52 if the order at which we truncate is high enough .",
    "however , for any choice of the power at which we truncate @xmath37 , the results will go wrong for large enough lorentzian @xmath52 .",
    "thus we chose to use a numerical method .",
    "we chose a real lorentzian @xmath61 and real @xmath51 ; then we used the perturbation calculation above ( including the truncation of @xmath62 ) to estimate values for @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( using equation ( [ deltatau ] ) and @xmath65 ) .",
    "both of these are expected to be complex .",
    "next , set @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 and numerically integrate the equations @xmath69 with the boundary conditions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 along real @xmath74 until we get @xmath75 to be purely real ( it is expected that the value of this quantity will then be close to the original value of @xmath52 selected )",
    ". here @xmath76 is differentiation of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath77 , etc . calculating the value of @xmath1 at this point we will find it has a small imaginary value ;",
    "by making small changes to the value of @xmath78 and integrating the equations repeatedly we can arrive at complex values for @xmath63 and @xmath79 which result in an instanton with real lorentzian @xmath52 and real @xmath51 close to the values we originally chose .",
    "next we compute the action for this instanton and the action for the hawking moss instanton with this value of lorentzian @xmath52 ; we difference these and divide by @xmath80 to get an estimate for @xmath81 , which we can compare to our previous calculation .",
    "this is how we obtained the plots in figures [ graph1 ] , [ graph2 ] and [ graph3 ] .",
    "it is clear that the points we get through the process described in section [ numericalsection ] can have differing values of @xmath83 depending on @xmath51 for the instanton under consideration .",
    "however , because @xmath60 can be written as a perturbation series in @xmath51 with lowest term of order @xmath80 , we expect the error in our estimate of @xmath81 to be of order @xmath51 .",
    "this was verified by taking @xmath84 and @xmath85 and comparing the resulting values of @xmath83 for the two instantons with the value of @xmath52 of interest .",
    "the difference was shown to be of order @xmath86 .",
    "the points plotted in figures [ graph1 ] , [ graph2 ] and [ graph3 ] are for values of @xmath85 and can therefore be expected to give errors in the estimate of @xmath87 of order @xmath88 .",
    "these plots therefore demonstrate that @xmath89 for all values of lorentzian @xmath52 and suggest that it tends to zero as lorentzian @xmath52 tends to @xmath55 from below .     and @xmath90 and @xmath91 :",
    "we see that the universe does nt start at the top of the hill for any of the possible values of real lorentzian @xmath52.[graph1 ] ]     and @xmath92 and @xmath91 : we see that the universe does nt start at the top of the hill for any of the possible values of real lorentzian @xmath52.[graph2 ] ]     and @xmath93 and @xmath91 : we see that the universe does nt start at the top of the hill for any of the possible values of real lorentzian @xmath52.[graph3 ] ]",
    "up to a prefactor , the probability of an instanton is given by @xmath94 . as we may neglect the prefactor for small @xmath1 ,  @xcite , we compare probabilities by considering @xmath95",
    "_ i.e. _ the universe starts at the top of the hill if and only if @xmath96 .",
    "looking at the plots in figures [ graph1 ] , [ graph2 ] and [ graph3 ] we conclude that the universe does nt start at the top of the hill for any of the possible values of @xmath97 , where @xmath3 is the trace of the euclidean second fundamental form , so the universe does nt start at the top of the hill for any of the possible values of real lorentzian @xmath52 .",
    "by considering the dominant contribution to the path integral appropriate to the top - down approach , we have seen that the universe does not start at the top of the hill .",
    "future work might be to extend this to a calculation which does nt just look at the top of the hill , so that we can see where the universe does start .",
    "i wish to thank stephen hawking for discusions about this work and for prompting interest in it ; and also neil turok , paul davis , thomas hertog and malcolm perry for discussions and encouragement .",
    "i am grateful for support from the epsrc ."
