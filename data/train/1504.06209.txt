    "of all the theoretically possible sources of gravitational waves , the compact binary systems , that is , those systems whose components are black holes or neutron stars , are the most interesting , both from the theoretical and observational viewpoints . concerning the theoretical aspects , it is possible to derive equations which hold even in the advanced stages of spiralling , while from the observational viewpoint , binary systems are among the most probable sources to have their gravitational radiation detected in the near future by the planned gravitational wave interferometers deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) , big bang observer ( bbo ) , laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) or evolved lisa ( elisa ) , advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( aligo ) ( and virgo ) , and et , as we will see later on .",
    "on the other hand , concerning the study of the gravitational waves themselves , of special interest for us are the stochastic backgrounds , which are characterized by spectra spanning a wide range of frequencies , where we can not distinguish individual sources , instead , we can distinguish only a `` smooth '' shape , characteristic for each type of physical process which created them .",
    "here we are interested in the background of gravitational waves generated by compact binary systems during their periodic or quasiperiodic phases in a cosmological scenario .",
    "the background considered here is similar to the confusion noise generated by galactic binaries in the lisa or elisa frequency band@xcite .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth mentioning the well - known fact that other authors studied such a subject .",
    "for example , in a recent review paper , regimbau@xcite considered the astrophysical gravitational wave stochastic background , where the background by the compact binaries is also considered .",
    "recently , zhu et al@xcite considered the stochastic gravitational wave background from coalescing binary black holes and rosado@xcite the gravitational wave background from compact binary systems in general .",
    "it is also worth mentioning some earlier works on this subject , including farmer and phinney@xcite , regimbau and de freitas pacheco@xcite and schneider et al@xcite .",
    "some ingredients considered by many of these authors include , for example , population synthesis and cosmic star formation histories .",
    "given that many authors studied the background generated by compact binaries , one could ask whether it is still worth studying such a subject . since there is other possible approaches , such as the one considered in the present paper , there is still space for keeping studying such a subject .    then , we shall present here an alternative method to calculate such a background , which is organized in steps .",
    "first , in section [ section2 ] , we present some properties of the gravitational radiation emitted by binary systems such as frequencies , intensities and their relation with the orbital parameters ; in section [ section3 ] , we describe the population characteristics of the systems in the form of distribution functions involving orbital parameters such as orbital distances and masses of the components of the systems and the star formation rate",
    ". once we have individual and population characteristics , we are ready to calculate the stochastic background , and in sect .",
    "[ section4 ] , a method for this calculation is shown , where we adapted a method used in the solution of a simple problem of statistical mechanics in order to obtain the desired background spectrum ; in section [ section5 ] , we present and discuss some results obtained by using the method mentioned above , besides showing and justifying the numerical parameters we used in the calculation ; in section [ section6 ] , we consider the detectability of the spectra by the cross - correlation of pairs of ligo and et , and in section [ conclusion ] , we present some conclusions and perspectives . finally , in order to give the reader more details , there is one appendix at the end of the paper .",
    "in the present paper , we are concerned with systems in circular orbits , where the only harmonic present in the emitted radiation is the first one , whose frequency is twice the orbital frequency ; for non null eccentricities , the higher harmonics will be in general important , in such a way that a fraction of the total power will be emitted at higher harmonics@xcite .    for circular orbits , the expression for the total power emitted in gravitational waves by binary systems",
    "is given by@xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the masses of the components of the system , @xmath3 is the orbital distance and @xmath4 is the orbital angular frequency which can be written as a function of the orbital distance via kepler s third law : @xmath5    besides , it is possible to put @xmath4 as a function of time ; with the aid of ( [ pot ] ) and after some algebraic manipulation , we obtain @xmath6 whose integration yields the orbital frequency as a function of time , namely , @xmath7    in ( [ freq ] ) , @xmath8 is the initial frequency , @xmath9 is the initial time and @xmath10 is a constant given by @xmath11    this expression , even though valid only for circular orbits , will be useful because the method developed in the present paper for the calculation of the stochastic background was first applied to circular orbits .",
    "besides , it gives us a good physical insight on how the evolution of the systems takes place .",
    "binary systems that contribute to the background may present orbital parameters such as semimajor axis and masses of the components that are quite different from system to system , which generally fill a continuous range of values .",
    "in general , it is possible to define mathematical functions which describe how the several values of a given parameter are distributed among the elements of the population .",
    "such distribution functions are vital to the calculation of the background and may be found in the literature under several forms .",
    "we are considering here the so called salpeter distribution@xcite , which is written as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 obeying the following normalization condition @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the maximum and minimum values of the masses that stars can have , respectively .",
    "we consider that stars can have minimum masses of @xmath19 and maximum masses of @xmath20@xcite , where this interval is split in subdivisions : stars with masses between @xmath19 and @xmath21 give rise to white dwarfs at the final stage of their evolution ; stars with masses in the interval between @xmath21 and @xmath22 originate neutron stars and stars more massive than @xmath22 end their existences as black holes .",
    "it is worth mentioning that salpeter distribution is valid only for the masses of the progenitor stars , and when such progenitors become black holes or neutron stars , their masses change , so we must estimate the values of the masses of such remnants . for the mass of the neutron stars , we use a constant value of @xmath23 , according to the chandrasekhar limit and the theories of formation of supernovae ii and ib@xmath24c@xcite . for the remnant black hole mass distribution ,",
    "we use ( [ blackhole ] ) , found in a recent study by zel et al@xcite , namely    @xmath25 , \\label{blackhole}\\ ] ]    where the masses are given in solar masses . concerning the range of masses of black holes , we consider the range of @xmath26@xcite .",
    "however , we must emphasize that there are uncertainties in the determination of exact values of this interval of masses , so we chose values that seem suitable , bearing in mind the cited references .",
    "an interesting study concerning the black hole formation parameters can also be found in postnov and yungelson@xcite .",
    "later on , we comment on how our results would be affected if a wider range of values were assumed",
    ".    however , the description of the star population is not complete without the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) , and we use the function by springel and hernquist@xcite , where the authors  considering a @xmath27cdm cosmology in a structure formation scenario with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , hubble constant @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and a scale invariant power spectrum with index @xmath33 , normalized to the abundance of rich galaxy clusters at present day ( @xmath34 )  found a star formation rate covering a range of redshifts from @xmath35 to the `` dark ages '' ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "such a function is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and with @xmath41 fixing the normalization .",
    "further , it is worth mentioning that the authors used hydrodynamic simulations , taking into account radiative heating and cooling of gas , supernova feedbacks and galactic winds .",
    "even though ( [ starfor ] ) gives information about the star formation up to @xmath42 , we must point out that the observations can give information from at most @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , uncertainties are inherent in any modeling above a given redshift .",
    "also , the star formation rate adopted in this work refers to the first population ii stars formed ; therefore it is consistent with the salpeter imf adopted .    on the other hand , in order to see how the spectra depend on this important ingredient",
    ", we also performed calculations using other sfrds .",
    "in particular , we considered four additional star formation rates@xcite .",
    "three of them are given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 denoting each case , @xmath46 , @xmath31 , @xmath47^{1/2}/(1+z)^{3/2}$ ] , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath29 , @xmath51 and the functions @xmath52 given by @xmath53 the fourth one has the following form :    @xmath54    it is worth mentioning that we will not consider here a complete description of these additional sfrd s .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper by zhu et al@xcite for a detailed discussion concerning this issue .",
    "notice that the three first functions describe formation rates for redshifts of up to @xmath55 and the fourth one is valid for redshifts of up to @xmath56 . besides , we use the following notation@xcite : for the rates given by ( [ sfr1 ] ) we use the labels sfr@xmath57 , sfr@xmath58 and sfr@xmath59 and for ( [ sfr2 ] ) we use hb@xmath60 ; the formation rate by springel and hernquist is written as sh@xmath61 .",
    "figure [ sfrds ] shows the sfrds adopted in the present paper .      before proceeding ,",
    "it is necessary to know the rate of formation of compact binary objects ; that is , given a population of progenitor stars , we need to know the fraction of stars which generate double compact binaries .",
    "as we may suppose , such fractions may assume different values because , from the formation of a population of stars to the final configuration ( which is characterized by a population containing main sequence stars , neutron stars , black holes and binaries formed from these objects ) , several processes may affect the final number of compact binaries present .",
    "for example , if a component of a binary system gives rise to a supernova , the explosion may break the system .",
    "further , note that not all progenitor stars form binary systems , and not all stars will generate black holes or neutron stars .    for the formation rate of double neutron star ( dns ) systems",
    ", we consider the mass fraction @xmath62 that is converted into dns systems@xcite , which is given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the fraction of binary systems that survive to the second supernova event , @xmath65 gives us the fraction of massive binaries ( that is , binary systems where both components could generate a supernova event ) formed inside the whole population of stars , and @xmath66 is the mass fraction of neutron star progenitors that , in our case and using ( [ salpeter1 ] ) , is given by @xmath67 numerically , we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    finally , the binary formation rate for dns systems is given by @xmath71    for black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) and binary of black holes ( bbh ) systems , we consider that the population of compact binaries is composed by dns systems ( @xmath72 ) , bbh systems ( @xmath73 ) and bhns systems ( @xmath74)@xcite . therefore , we may use these proportions to estimate the mass fraction for bhns and bbh systems .      for the distribution function of the semimajor axis , we followed belczynski et al@xcite , who made a very comprehensive study of the compact binary systems .",
    "in particular , we used the results present in fig .",
    "@xmath75 of that paper . to deal more easily with the distribution functions obtained by belczynski et al , we fit them with gaussian functions . a close comparison between our functions ( see fig .  [ gaussian ] ) and fig .",
    "@xmath75 of the cited paper shows that the fits work very well .",
    "the semimajor axis distributions are then written as follows : @xmath76 \\label{distr1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the semimajor axis , which is given in solar radius units , and the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are given in table [ gauss ] .",
    "llll system & @xmath77 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 + dns & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 + bhns & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + bbh & @xmath82 & @xmath88 & @xmath89 +    it is worth noting that the above distribution functions obey the following normalization condition@xcite :    @xmath90dr=1\\ ] ]    in addition , it is useful to have information about the orbital periods or frequencies of the systems . a convenient way to achieve",
    "this is to plot the distribution of the initial frequencies .",
    "as separations and frequencies are closely related by kepler s third law , it is straightforward to obtain the distribution of the frequencies from ( [ distr1 ] ) ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of binary systems is the time evolution of the orbital distance due to the emission of gravitational radiation . for the systems considered in this paper , such variations are very important , especially at the stages near the coalescence ,",
    "so the distribution functions shown above must be modified in order to take into account the time as an independent variable .",
    "first , let us consider the distribution given by ( [ distr1 ] ) , which will be modified with the aid of ( [ freq ] ) , valid for circular orbits .    before including the time variable in ( [ distr1 ] ) , it is convenient to put this function in terms of the frequency , by means of ( [ kepler1 ] ) .",
    "so , changing the variables via    @xmath92    we get after some algebra    @xmath93^{1/3}\\omega^{-5/3}\\mbox{exp}\\left[\\frac{-(r-\\bar{r})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right ] \\label{distr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we use ( [ freq ] ) and perform a change of variables in ( [ distr2 ] ) , writing @xmath94 where @xmath8 is the initial frequency , which was associated with the variable @xmath4 in ( [ distr2 ] ) .",
    "so , performing the derivative @xmath95 of ( [ freq ] ) we have @xmath96 which , substituting in ( [ distr3 ] ) , gives after some algebra    @xmath97^{1/3}\\\\ & & \\times\\omega^{-11/3}\\omega^{2}_{0}\\mbox{exp}\\left[\\frac{-(r-\\bar{r})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right ] \\label{dist1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath98^{-3/8}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 is given by ( [ const ] ) .",
    "we should do a further coordinate transformation , writing @xmath99 as a function of the emitted frequency @xmath100 instead of the angular frequency @xmath4 .",
    "such a transformation , given by @xmath101 , is trivial , and all the equations used from now on will be written as a function of @xmath100 . as an example , fig .",
    "[ evolfreq ] shows the initial distribution @xmath102 for dns systems .",
    "note that @xmath3 and @xmath78 were maintained in the above equations just for simplifying their presentations ; they are effectively substituted by the appropriate set of variable transformations .",
    "it is worth noting that hils et al@xcite followed a similar procedure ; namely , they started with a given initial distribution function and evolved it as a function of time .      the cosmological model adopted here , which is the @xmath27cdm , has the volume element given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 and the comoving distance given by @xmath105,\\ ] ] where the density parameters ( which should not be confused with the frequency @xmath4 in the previous sections ) obey the following relations : @xmath106 the subscripts m , dm , b , @xmath27 and k refer to matter , dark matter , baryonic matter , cosmological constant and curvature , respectively",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath107 is defined by @xmath108    in the present paper we consider the case of a flat universe ( i.e. @xmath109 ) , where the cosmological parameters were presented in the previous section .",
    "the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by compact binaries will be calculated by means of@xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 represents the dimensionless amplitude of the spectrum , @xmath112 is the amplitude of the emitted radiation of a single source , @xmath113 is the observed frequency , and @xmath114 is the differential rate of generation of gravitational radiation . the differential rate of production of gravitational waves is derived by using a statistical approach .",
    "one of the aims of such a derivation was to take in to account the change in the gravitational wave frequency emitted by binary systems that are particularly important for the system emitting at the high band of the spectra .    in the present case @xmath112",
    "is given by@xcite    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath117 is the total mass , and @xmath118 is the luminosity distance . besides , the differential rate @xmath114 in ( [ bg ] ) for the case of bbh systems may be written as @xmath119    notice that we consider in the above equation the most general case , where the masses of the components of the systems are not constant , which in our case refers to the systems which are formed by two black holes obeying the distribution function given by ( [ blackhole ] ) .",
    "for the case where one or both components are neutron stars , one or both distributions for the masses in ( [ taxa ] ) will be considered as a dirac delta , since we are considering that all neutron stars have the same masses .",
    "further , note that , in order to simplify the notation , we have written the masses of the black holes as @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the term @xmath120 will be determined in a subsequent section .    still concerning ( [ bg ] ) , it is worth mentioning that the starting point of its derivation comes from an energy flux equation .",
    "this equation was first derived in a paper by de araujo et al@xcite and was used in their various articles . in particular , in a subsequent paper@xcite they gave a more detailed derivation of this equation , showing its robustness .",
    "also , although apparently simple , it contains the correct and necessary ingredients to calculate the background of gravitational waves for a given type of source .",
    "it is also important to call attention to a particular issue considered in the cited paper@xcite .",
    "they raised a discussion regarding the inclusion or not of an additional @xmath121 factor in the denominator of the integrand of ( [ bg ] ) , which many authors consider to take into account the time dilation due to the expansion of universe .",
    "these authors argued that when one uses the luminosity distance in the calculation of the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath112 , this distance already contains all necessary @xmath121 factors .",
    "this is in fact a controversial issue . in practice , however , the inclusion of the additional time dilation factor does not modify significantly the amplitude of the gravitational wave background .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we included the @xmath121 factor in the denominator of the integrand of ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "basically , the problem of determining the stochastic background comes down to the counting of the number of binary systems that , at a given instant of time , emit gravitational waves at a given frequency .",
    "specifically , when one is dealing with high frequencies ( about @xmath57hz or more ) , the systems evolve very fast , and the frequencies of the emitted radiation vary in a small timescale , making the calculation of the systems which have the same frequency at a given moment of time more difficult .",
    "however , the problem can be handled by adopting a particular way of modelling the behavior of the population of binary systems ; let us idealize a one - dimensional `` space '' where the values of the coordinates are the values of the emitted frequencies .    in this context , the evolving binary systems can be represented as points moving in the direction of increasing values of the coordinate ( emitted frequency ) . at this point",
    ", we can note that those points have a behavior similar to a gas inside a chamber , where the particles have a certain spatial distribution and move towards a given wall of the chamber at different velocities .",
    "so , using this analogy , we can adapt some techniques of statistical mechanics in order to develop a method to calculate the background .",
    "let us consider a gas in thermal equilibrium contained in a rectangular chamber of cross section ( relatively to the @xmath122 axis ) equal to @xmath123 .",
    "an elementary question concerning such a configuration is to calculate how many particles ( or molecules ) reach a given surface ( perpendicular to the @xmath122 axis ) of area @xmath123 in a time interval @xmath124 ; that is , the aim is to calculate the flux @xmath125 of particles through a given area .",
    "discussions on this question may be found in the literature , and we follow a particular way of handling the problem@xcite ; let then @xmath126 be a differential volume adjacent to the surface @xmath123 , according to fig .",
    "[ excent ] .",
    "if we consider that the particles are distributed in a homogeneous way inside the chamber , the fraction of particles inside the volume @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the total volume of the chamber , but using the velocity of a given particle at the @xmath122 direction we have : @xmath130    in this way , all the particles inside the volume @xmath127 will reach the surface @xmath123 in a time interval @xmath124 . in order to calculate the total number of particles that hit the area @xmath123",
    ", we should integrate over the velocities @xmath131 , using a given velocity distribution function , which we write as @xmath132 .",
    "so , considering that @xmath133 is the total number of particles at a given interval @xmath134 , we get @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the number of particles in @xmath127 , which have velocities in the interval @xmath137 . now",
    ", we should integrate only over the positive values of @xmath131 , because we are considering only particles that are moving towards the surface @xmath123 , so we get the number of particles per area @xmath123 and time interval @xmath124 ( the desired flux @xmath125 ) : @xmath138    this is sufficient for the solution of the statistical problem , but we need to make two modifications in the above derivation in order to adapt it to the calculation of the stochastic background .",
    "first , note that the cross section of the chamber is constant , so ( [ german ] ) may be rewritten as    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the total length of the chamber .",
    "thus ( [ fracao ] ) is rewritten as    @xmath141    a second modification is to consider a more general case , where the spatial distribution is not constant .",
    "so , it is reasonable to write the expression above as @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the fraction of particles at the interval @xmath144 . if the spatial distribution obeys a function which depends only on @xmath122 , which we call @xmath145 , we can write the function @xmath146 in the following way @xmath147 for the case where @xmath145 is not normalized . with these two considerations at hand , the problem is ready to be used in the calculation of @xmath114 .      before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth stressing that the derivation of @xmath114 presented here refers to the source frame .",
    "therefore , @xmath100 in the equations below is the emitted frequency , and the time derivatives are also taken with respect to the source frame .    the calculation of @xmath114 by means of the statistical approach shown above",
    "is done by performing two changes : instead of using the spatial distribution @xmath145 , let us use a frequency distribution @xmath148 and change the velocity distribution for a distribution in a new variable @xmath149 , which we shall define by @xmath150 that is , the time derivative of the frequency ( in analogy to the definition of velocity , which establishes the time variation of the spatial coordinate ) .",
    "once this is done , we need to find out the forms of these two new functions .",
    "so , the function @xmath148 may be defined as follows : @xmath151 where @xmath9 represents the instant of the birth of the systems , @xmath152 is the formation rate of binary systems ( where the subindex @xmath153 is to be substituted by dns , bhns and bbh in each case ) and @xmath154 is given by ( [ dist1 ] ) and represents the fraction of systems that begins to exist at the instant @xmath9 and that have frequencies in a given interval @xmath155 .",
    "note that here , for sake of notation , we explicit the dependence of ( [ dist1 ] ) on @xmath156 and @xmath9 . besides , we refer the reader to appendix [ appena ] to see the derivation of ( [ inte ] ) .",
    "further , note that @xmath157 and @xmath9 are related to each other by @xmath158^{-1}$]@xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath159 will have a peculiar form .",
    "first , we need to note that from ( [ frequ ] ) we have @xmath160 then , we conclude that there will be just one value of @xmath149 for each value of @xmath100 , which allows us to write @xmath159 as a dirac delta function + @xmath161    where @xmath162 is the total number of systems and @xmath163 is the particular value of @xmath149 corresponding to each frequency @xmath100 .",
    "now we can rewrite ( [ back1 ] ) as + @xmath164 where we used ( [ back2 ] ) with the variable @xmath122 substituted by @xmath100 .",
    "now , noting that the denominator of the term between parenthesis is the total number of systems , using the function given by ( [ xi ] ) and changing the differential @xmath155 by means of the chain rule , we get @xmath165 by integrating over @xmath149 and rearranging the result , we obtain @xmath166dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath167 is number or systems by time interval @xmath124 . recalling that this rate @xmath167 is per comoving volume , we may write explicitly @xmath168 and ( [ bg ] ) assumes the form @xmath169    further , using this amplitude we can derive a largely used quantity , the so called spectral amplitude , which is given by : @xmath170    it is worth noting that we use the classical ( i.e. , nonrelativistic ) approach in the above statistical problem . there are two reasons for this choice : first",
    ", we should note that even in the late stages of evolution , the components of the binary systems have low orbital velocities ( i.e. , nonrelativistic velocities ) , and second , in all stages of evolution , the time variation of the orbital frequency ( @xmath149 ) is not fast enough , and therefore , it is not necessary to consider special relativistic corrections when one makes the analogy between @xmath149 and the velocity of the particles . concerning general relativistic effects , the well - known quadrupole formula is more than enough .",
    "this formula is ( implicitly ) used in the calculation of the time evolution of the orbital frequency ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides , we refer the reader to the paper  @xcite , where we show the ( first ) simple example of application of the method described here ; namely , we calculate the stochastic background generated by double neutron star systems , considering an uniform orbital period distribution .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to investigate whether the background of gravitational waves by the cosmological compact binary systems could in principle generate a  confusion noise \" for the spatial and terrestrial interferometers ; in the same way the galactic binary systems do for lisa@xcite .",
    "if such confusion noise really exists , it must necessarily be taken into account since it could well dominate the sensitivity curves of the detectors .      for dns systems ,",
    "we consider for the maximum frequency of the gravitational waves the emitted value of @xmath171hz@xcite ; for bhns systems , we use ( [ kepler ] ) in order to determine the maximum frequency @xmath172^{1/2 } \\label{kepler}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 is the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the black hole@xcite , given by @xmath176    for bbh systems , the maximum frequency is given by@xcite    @xmath177    where @xmath178 is the symmetric mass ratio , @xmath117 is the total mass and the polynomial coefficients are @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the values of the minimum frequencies do not play a decisive role in the calculation ; that is , they do not affect the shapes of the spectra .",
    "therefore , we considered the value of @xmath182hz for the three families of compact systems .",
    "this choice is suggested by analyzing the behavior of ( [ distr2 ] ) ( see also fig .  [ evolfreq ] ) . as can be seen , the number of systems emitting below @xmath182hz is negligle as compared with those emitting around @xmath183hz .",
    "figures [ espectro1 ] , [ espectro2 ] and [ espectro3 ] show the spectra for dns , bhns and bbh systems , respectively , which are compared to the sensitivity curves of lisa , elisa@xcite , bbo@xcite , decigo@xcite , et@xcite and aligo@xcite . the sensitivity curve for lisa",
    "may be found at + www.srl.caltech.edu/~shane / sensitivity/.    when observing the curves for the dns and bbh systems , we note that lisa , elisa , bbo , decigo , aligo and et would not be affected by such a background .",
    "bhns binaries would be marginally important for et at the frequencies of highest sensitivity .",
    "when observing the shape of the spectra , we note that there is a cutoff frequency , which in the present case is equal to the maximum frequency of the gravitational waves allowed for each type of system . beyond this maximum frequency ,",
    "the systems reach the chirp phase that is characterized by a particular pattern of emission , but we are not considering such a phase here .",
    "in fact , the chirp and coalescing phases will be considered in forthcoming papers .",
    "it is also interesting to see the influence of the initial distribution function of frequencies on the spectra .",
    "as the distributions for orbital separations and frequencies are closely related , we can achieve this objective by handling the distribution of the initial separations .",
    "so , as an example , we calculated the spectra for dns systems , considering the hypothetical cases where for the standard deviation @xmath79 of the initial distribution given by ( [ distr1 ] ) gives the values @xmath184 and @xmath185 . as expected , the semimajor axis distribution has little influence on the spectra for frequencies much shorter than the smallest typical birth period .",
    "our calculations also show that the resulting spectra do not depend significantly on the sfrds adopted .",
    "there are two main reasons for this result .",
    "the first one has to do with the fact that the sources located at @xmath186 do not significantly affect the resulting spectra .",
    "the second reason is related to the fact that the sfrds for @xmath187 are similar .",
    "besides , through ( [ source ] ) , we observe the influence of the masses of the systems . for comparison ,",
    "let us consider a bbh system where both components have the maximum value of mass , but considering two cases : in the first case considering that the maximum mass is of @xmath188@xcite , and in the second case , using the more realistic value of @xmath189 as an upper limit ( remembering that this is the value considered in the present paper ) .",
    "the amplitude given by ( [ source ] ) in the first case is @xmath190 greater than the amplitude given by the second case . as a result",
    ", the amplitude of the background would also be higher .",
    "notice that the shapes of the spectra are different .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "for a given semimajor axis , dns systems emit gravitational waves at the same frequency , since we consider that all neutron stars have the same masses . for bbh ( bhns ) systems , however , the emitted frequencies depend on the black holes masses that , contrary to the neutron stars , assume different values since they follow a distribution function .",
    "it is worth paying attention to some similar studies found in the literature , since they could well consider different approaches .",
    "for example , in schneider at al@xcite the spectra were calculated for binary systems formed by neutron stars , black holes and white dwarfs at the early stages of spiralling .",
    "these authors used a different method , based on binary population synthesis programs .",
    "the differences in the results have to do with the fact that in their calculations , the number of systems that contributes to the lowest frequencies is much greater than that of those that contribute to the highest frequencies .",
    "furthermore , these authors considered lower values for the minimum frequencies than those we are using .    in regimbau@xcite ,",
    "the stochastic background generated by dns systems in the frequency band of lisa is considered , where the author used a particular probability distribution@xcite in order to generate a population of dns systems . here , the author considered the time evolution of the orbital parameters in a different way we do ; actually , she considered the difference between the redshift of the birth of the systems @xmath191 and the redshift of the emission @xmath192 of gravitational waves , where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are related to each other by the frequency of the emitted waves .",
    "the predicted spectra of the present paper can not be detected by single interferometric detectors such as the ones cited above , but a putative detection of these spectra can occur by means of a suitable correlation of two or more detectors@xcite .",
    "more specifically , we will consider the cross correlation for pairs of initial ligos ( iligo ) , enhanced ligos ( eligo ) , aligos and ets .",
    "for a cross correlation of two interferometric detectors , we can quantify the detectability of a stochastic background by calculating the signal - to - noise ratio ( s@xmath24n ) , which in this case is given by@xcite :    @xmath193 \\label{sn}\\ ] ]    where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the spectral noise densities , @xmath196 is the integration time ( we are considering @xmath197yr ) , @xmath198 is the overlap reduction function , which depends on the relative positions and orientations of the two interferometers ; and @xmath199 is the energy density parameter , which is given by@xcite @xmath200    in table [ snr ] we show the results for s@xmath24n for the three families of compact binaries . for pairs of iligo , we have s@xmath24n@xmath201 for the three families of compact binaries , which indicates that there is no possibility of detection ; for pairs of eligo and aligo we have s@xmath24n@xmath202 for the bhns and dns systems , where bhns systems have the highest possibility of detection ; for pairs of et , the s@xmath24n is higher than @xmath203 for the three families of systems .    lllll system & & ( s@xmath24n ) & & + & iligo & eligo & aligo & et + dns & @xmath204 & @xmath205 & @xmath206 & @xmath207 + bhns & @xmath208 & @xmath209 & @xmath210 & @xmath211 + bbh & @xmath212 & @xmath213 & @xmath214 & @xmath215 +",
    "our main aim here was to develop an alternative method to calculate the background generated by cosmological compact binary systems during their periodic or quasiperiodic phases .",
    "we use here an analogy with a problem of statistical mechanics in order to perform such a calculation as well as taking into account the temporal variation of the orbital parameters of the systems .",
    "such a background is of particular interest since it could well form an important foreground for the planned gravitational wave interferometers decigo , bbo , lisa or elisa , aligo and et .",
    "this new tool for the calculation of the background has the advantage of being simple and versatile , because the distribution functions and other functions and parameters could be easily changed without the need of modifying the formalism .",
    "our results show that the background generated by the cosmological compact binaries during their periodic and quasiperiodic phases does not form a foreground for lisa , elisa , bbo , decigo and aligo . for the et a foreground ( confusion noise )",
    "could marginally be formed .",
    "it is worth recalling that in the present study , we only considered systems in circular orbits , and the inclusion of the eccentricity will be investigated in a future study .",
    "besides , we will use the formalism developed here in the calculation of the background generated by the coalescence compact binary systems",
    ".    we also investigated if the backgrounds studied here could be detected using a cross - correlation of two interferometric detectors .",
    "we note that pairs of aligos and ets could in principle detect such backgrounds .    given that by the time et becomes operative , there will probably be some advanced configuration of virgo , and then , it will be possible to correlate them .",
    "such a cross correlation would be , in principle , much more sensitive than a pair of aligos .",
    "therefore , it will be possible to investigate the kind of backgrounds studied here .",
