    "ngc 7252 is a prototypical merger remnant that hosts one of the largest populations of young massive star clusters known ( whitmore et al .  1993 ;",
    "miller et al .",
    "1997 , hereinafter m97 ) , including two clusters with stellar masses exceeding @xmath6  ( maraston et al .",
    "2004 , hereinafter m04 ; bastian et al .",
    "2006 , hereinafter b06 ) . while there is ongoing star - formation within a central disk of gas ( schweizer  1982 ) the cluster population as a whole is dominated by an extended halo population of ymcs with an age of @xmath7  myr ( e.g. , schweizer & seitzer 1998 , hereinafter s98 ) .",
    "studies of luminosity profiles of ymcs have shown that they often differ from those of classic globular clusters .",
    "the latter are generally well fit by king ( 1962 ) profiles that display a truncation at large radii .",
    "this truncation is thought to be related to the tidal radius , inside which stars are bound to the cluster , while outside the stars move according to the galactic potential .",
    "many ymcs , on the other hand , do not display such a truncation , but rather are well fit by extended power - law envelopes .",
    "this was quantified by elson , fall , & freeman  ( 1987 , hereinafter eff ) for ymcs in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "these authors fit profiles of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance from the cluster centre and @xmath10 is a characteristic radius . for @xmath11",
    "the eff profile becomes a simple power - law .",
    "eff profiles have been shown to also provide good fits to ymcs in m33 ( san roman et al .",
    "2012 ) and in spiral galaxies more generally ( larsen  2004 ) .",
    "observations of young cluster systems have shown that the clusters themselves are often grouped into larger structures , cluster complexes , with radii of tens to hundreds of parsecs ( e.g. ,  zhang et al .",
    "2001 ; larsen  2004 ) .",
    "these complexes often appear to be centrally concentrated , hosting a dominant cluster in the centre , with a similar eff - type power - law decrease in surface brightness with increasing radius ( bastian et al .",
    "the outer envelope of the complexes is , at least partly , made up of smaller individual clusters .",
    "fellhauer & kroupa  ( 2005 ) carried out @xmath12-body model simulations of a system of massive star clusters distributed as a plummer sphere , assuming that the clusters are in virial equilibrium , and found that the clusters merge within a few hundred myr .",
    "the remnant formed in their simulations has a massive central cluster and an extremely extended outer halo , leading the authors to suggest that the massive cluster w3 in ngc  7252 , may have formed in such a manner .",
    "interested by the extreme nature of the ymcs in ngc  7252 , i.e. their high masses and relatively large ages ( @xmath13  myr ) , we have obtained _ hst_/wfc3 images of ngc  7252 to study the luminosity profiles of these clusters in detail . despite the relatively large ( 64 mpc for @xmath14  mpc@xmath15 ) distance to the host galaxy ,",
    "a large number of the clusters are ( semi)resolved . we were able to trace the profiles of three of the most massive clusters out to distances of more than 150  pc from the cluster centres .",
    "specifically , our main goal was to see whether the cluster profiles are truncated and , if not , how far they extend .",
    "we were also interested in studying whether the presence or absence of any extended envelope might correlate with the projected distance of clusters from the remnant s centre , which would be expected if the tidal truncation of clusters in the galaxy potential would already have had an observable impact .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] we present the data and methods used to create the point spread function , and then outline the steps taken to generate the cluster sample . in ",
    "[ sec : profiles ] we introduce the techniques used to measure the effective radii of the clusters and study the luminosity profiles of three massive clusters ( w3 , w26 and w30 ) in detail . in ",
    "[ sec : radii ] we study the distribution of  for the entire population and investigate the possibility of a mass  radius relation for massive clusters . in ",
    "[ sec : reff_dgc ] we investigate the relation between the effective radius and galactocentric distance of the clusters in our sample . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we compare the extended profiles of clusters in ngc  7252 with those of other known clusters and discuss the possible origin of such extended envelopes .",
    "finally ,   [ sec : conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "broad - band images of ngc  7252 were obtained with _ hst_/wfc3 on 2010 july 29 through the @xmath16 ( sdss @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( sdss @xmath19 ) filters ( go-11554 , pi : n.  bastian ) .",
    "the filters were chosen to provide coverage in the blue and red part of the optical , and to be wide in order to maximise the throughput and signal - to - noise ratio of the brightness profiles .",
    "the total exposure time through each filter was 2120  s , split into four 500 s exposures plus two short , 60 s exposures to avoid saturation of the bright central regions of each cluster and the galaxy .",
    "the individual exposures in each filter were taken with small spatial offsets ( `` dithers '' ) between one another to allow improved spatial sampling of the point spread function ( psf ) as well as the elimination of hot pixels and cosmic - ray hits during image combination . prior to running the pyraf / stsdas task multidrizzle to produce a combined image for each filter , we created sky variance maps for each individual exposure for the purpose of deriving weight maps for the final image combination .",
    "these maps were constructed from the sky values of the individual exposures , the flatfield reference file , the dark current reference file , and the read - out noise values as listed in the image headers . as such , these sky variance maps contain all noise components of the image except for the poisson noise associated with the sources on the image .",
    "the final run of multidrizzle was performed by shrinking the input pixels by @xmath3% at the stage where input pixels are drizzled onto the output image grid ( i.e. , a value of 0.8 was adopted for the final_pixfrac parameter ) , and we chose an output image pixel size of 0028/pixel .",
    "these various parameters were selected after extensive experimentation , and they allow a good match to the degree of subsampling induced by the dither pattern we used .",
    "saturated pixels in the 500 s exposures were replaced by the corresponding pixels in the short exposures while running multidrizzle .",
    "this was achieved by setting the appropriate data quality flag for the affected pixels of the long exposures .    additionally , we used wfc3 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) images ( go-11691 , pi : p.  goudfrooij ) that will be presented in more detail in goudfrooij et al .",
    "( in prep . ) . in brief , the total @xmath20 exposure was 3050 s , and the images were reduced in much the same way as those described above .",
    "these @xmath21 images were not used for size or profile determination , but only for photometric selection .",
    "in addition to the wfc3 images of ngc  7252 , we also used archival data to study the luminosity profiles of other ymcs .",
    "in particular , we used _",
    "vlt_/hawk - i near - infrared @xmath22-band images of 30  doradus to study the outer profile of the central cluster , r136 ( programme i d 60.a-9283 ) .",
    "the data were taken as part of the commissioning of the instrument and are presented in more detail in campbell et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .    for the ymc in ngc  6946",
    ", we used the _",
    "@xmath23-band images presented in detail by larsen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . finally , for the study of knot  s in the antennae galaxies we used _",
    "hst_/acs @xmath23-band images taken from the _ hubble legacy archive_.",
    "these images are presented in more detail in bastian et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and whitmore et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .      in order to get accurate measurements for the profiles and radii of the target clusters we required an accurate model of the point - spread function ( psf ) of our data .",
    "we did this in the following two ways .",
    "the first was to select sources of various brightnesses throughout the image that appeared to be unresolved ( i.e. , they all had the same fwhm ) and use them in the _ iraf _ task _ psf _ to generate an empirical psf . for this we used @xmath24 sources located throughout the image .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is that it will blur any effect of the psf varying across the chips .",
    "a second set of psfs was created from the grid of empirical wfc3 psfs assembled by jay anderson ( hereafter , _ epsfs _ ; see anderson & king  2006 for the acs version ) .",
    "since the latter psfs are created for individual _",
    "flt.fits images rather than for images combined with multidrizzle , we wrote a package based on maurizio paolillo s _ multiking_paolillo / software.html ] suite of scripts ( modified to work for wfc3 images ) .",
    "the package creates empirical psfs at the location of each gc candidate in blank versions of each individual input _",
    "flt.fits wfc3 image , and then combines those files by multidrizzle in the exact same way as the final ngc  7252 images .",
    "these psfs were then subsampled by a factor 10 in order for them to be used appropriately within _ ishape _",
    "( see below ) , using polynomial interpolation .",
    "we compared the empirically derived psfs with the psfs in the _ epsf _ grid by deriving the radii of the spectroscopically confirmed clusters ( see   [ sec : sample ] ) using _ ishape _ ( larsen 1999 ; see also   [ sec : ishape ] below ) with both sets of psfs .",
    "we did not find any systematic differences between the results using either of the psfs , with measured fwhms being the same to within @xmath25% . this difference is smaller than that due to the choice of the radius over which to measure the size , or the choice of the type of profile to fit ( king vs eff ) .",
    "for the results presented below we adopt the _ epsf _ grid .    for each of the methods we treated the two filters ( @xmath16 and @xmath18 ) independently .",
    "the main goal of this work was to measure the surface - brightness profiles ( sbps ) and  of the clusters within ngc  7252 , focussing on the @xmath7  myr old population formed during the galaxy merger , i.e. , clusters outside the central 12-diameter star - forming disk ( m97 , s98 ) .",
    "this population is known to include extremely massive clusters ( m97 , s98 , m04 , b06 ) , even though the population is consistent with a power - law mass function of index @xmath26 ( b06 ) .    in order to study the sbps of the clusters , high s / n",
    "is required .",
    "we selected @xmath27 source candidates ( @xmath28  mag ) outside the central disk ( galactocentric radii @xmath29 , @xmath30  kpc ) , extending out to 108  ( @xmath31  kpc ) from the galaxy center .",
    "we excluded candidates with nearby neighbours that would complicate the sbp analysis . in order to remove background galaxies we measured the magnitudes and colours of each of these candidates from the @xmath20 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 images , using an aperture of 10 pixels in radius .",
    "the resulting colour  colour diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colour ] , where the spectroscopically confirmed clusters ( s98 ) are shown in red .",
    "the dashed box shows the colour region where we selected our sample .",
    "additionally , we show the evolutionary track of a galev simple stellar population ( ssp ) model of solar metallicity as a solid line ( kotulla et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the limiting ages of the model clusters that pass our colour selection are 250  myr and 1  gyr , as marked .",
    "note , however , that the observed cluster colours are concentrated around 400500  myr .",
    "the applied colour selection removes background galaxies and effectively limits our study to the intermediate age ( @xmath13  myr ) cluster population . using our colour selection criteria , we found 52 candidate clusters .",
    "we then fit these candidates with _",
    "ishape _ , adopting an eff profile with @xmath32 , and measured their concentration index ( ci ; see ",
    "[ sec : ishape ] below ) .",
    "we also performed aperture photometry for each of the candidates with aperture radii ranging from 1 to 30  pixels .",
    "examples of the resulting growth curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] .",
    "using these two methods , we selected objects that appeared extended in each method . figure  [ fig : comp ] shows a comparison of the measured cis and  for an eff profile with @xmath32 .",
    "the dashed lines mark limits where we can resolve sources .",
    "red triangles represent confirmed clusters within ngc  7252 based on optical spectroscopy and agreement with the systemic velocity ( s98 ) .",
    "additionally , we performed resolution tests by adding artificial clusters ( with known radii ) to the images which were analysed in the same way as discussed above , in order to confirm the adopted limits .",
    "[ fig : comp ] clearly shows , _ all of the confirmed clusters from s98 are resolved_. also , of the total sample of 52 candidate clusters 36 are resolved in both the _ ishape _ and ci analyses .",
    "however , we note again that our cluster sample is not complete in any way , as only bright and resolved clusters were selected .    table  [ tab : catalogue ] gives the ids , magnitudes , cis , estimated effective radii ( adopting an eff profile with @xmath32 ) and galactocentric distances of all the clusters that pass our colour selection and appear resolved using both _",
    "ishape _ and the ci method .",
    "once the cluster candidates were selected we used three methods to study their profiles and effective radii .    first , for the brightest clusters ( e.g. , w3 , w26 and w30 ) we performed a detailed analysis of their sbps with the intention to constrain the profile shape , effective",
    "radius and extent to which their envelopes reach .",
    "these will be discussed individually below .    as a second method",
    ", we used the _ ishape _ algorithm ( larsen  1999 ) with a fixed profile shape ( an eff profile with @xmath33 ) to measure each cluster s fwhm , which in turn can be used to derive its .",
    "the fitting radius was chosen to be 20 pixels (=",
    "@xmath34  pc ) , although we did not find any systematic effects as a function of the fitting radii .",
    "as a third method , we measured for each cluster the concentration index ci ( e.g. , m97 ; whitmore et al .",
    "2010 ) , which is defined as the magnitude difference between measurements with a 1 pixel and a 3 pixel radius aperture .",
    "we also experimented with different aperture combinations and found consistent results .    in all plots of the sbps to be shown below",
    ", we have added a constant to the derived sbp so that the surface brightness becomes 0  in the first bin .",
    "when profiles of more resolved clusters are shown for comparison , we shift these to have a value of 0  at the same physical radius as that for the ngc  7252 clusters .            )",
    "are plotted versus concentration indices ci(1@xmath353 ) measured with apertures of one and three pixel radius .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks the fwhm of 0.2 pixels used for the adopted profile , while the horizontal dashed line denotes the cut applied between point - like and extended sources .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed clusters are shown as ( red ) triangles . only sources that passed our colour selection are shown.,width=321 ]    [ [ subsec : w3 ] ] w3 ~~      cluster w3 is an enormously massive cluster of @xmath36  ( s98 , m04 ) . in order to determine its profile and effective radius we fit various profile types with _ ishape _ , letting the fwhm as well as the index @xmath37 ( for an eff profile ) or concentration parameter @xmath38 ( for a king profile ) vary .",
    "we tested multiple initial guesses ( index and concentration ) for the algorithm and found good convergence .    once the best fitting profiles were found for each profile type , we created artificial clusters of that profile type and radius , with the same brightness as w3 ( within 40 pixels ) and added them to the images ( 7 artificial clusters for each profile type ) at the same galactocentric distance as w3 , but at different position angles .",
    "we then directly compared the sbps of the models with w3 .",
    "example profile comparisons are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : w3_profile_king ] and [ fig : w3_profile_eff ] for king and eff profiles , respectively .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : w3_profile_king ] , _ the profile of w3 does not show any signs of truncation _ out to where the background was taken at 2.2  ( @xmath39  pc ) . comparing with the best fitting king model profiles of @xmath40 ( top panel ) and @xmath41 ( bottom panel ) ,",
    "it is clear that  if present ",
    "such a truncation would have been observed .",
    "if we allow @xmath38 to vary , values of @xmath42 are preferred .",
    "in contrast , eff model profiles , which do not have any truncation , provide excellent fits to the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : w3_profile_eff ] shows two examples : the lowest-@xmath43 profile ( within a fitting radius of 20 pixels  = 0.56  @xmath44 175  pc ) is shown in the top panel , while a similar profile with @xmath45 is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "both model profiles reproduce the data quite well , and we adopt a best - fit index of @xmath46 for the full cluster profile .",
    "the corresponding effective radius is @xmath47  pc for both the @xmath16 and @xmath18 images .",
    "the reason for the larger error on the high end is that for shallower indices ( approaching @xmath48 )  becomes undefined .",
    "hence , values of @xmath37 near 2 lead to large uncertainties in the determination of .",

    "the dashed vertical line marks a 0.7  radius ( @xmath49  pc ) for reference .",
    "note that a truncation in the profile in either case would be observable .",
    "if the underlying profile is best described by a king profile , then in order for the truncation to not be seen the concentration parameter would need to be @xmath50.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   ( top ) and @xmath41 ( bottom ) .",

    "this value is very similar to that found by m04 , namely @xmath53  pc , based on lower - resolution wfpc2 observations .",
    "hence , we confirm the dynamical mass estimate of @xmath54  by m04 , making w3 the most massive star cluster presently known .      the next most massive cluster in the ngc  7252 population is w30 , with a measured dynamical mass of @xmath55  ( b06 ) .",
    "w30 is @xmath56  mag fainter in the @xmath23-band than w3 , resulting in a lower s / n , especially in the outer regions .",
    "additionally , the analysis is complicated somewhat by the presence of two neighbouring sources at @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "however , these sources are significantly fainter than w30 on both the @xmath16 and @xmath18 images and can , therefore , be masked out by the _",
    "software during the fitting .",
    "the measured sbp of w30 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_profiles ] as solid ( green ) circles .",
    "one can readily see by eye that w30 is more compact than w3 , although it , too , features an extended profile .",
    "this profile can be traced out to at least 250  pc ( 0.8 ) from the cluster centre .    carrying out an analysis similar to that described above for w3 , we estimate values of @xmath59  pc and @xmath60  pc for w30 on the @xmath16 and @xmath18 images , respectively .",
    "the straight average of these two values is @xmath61  pc , in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath62  pc found by b06 .",
    "the index of the best - fit eff profile for w30 appears to be similar to that for w3 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the @xmath16 and @xmath18 images , respectively .",
    "there is some indication that w30 is slightly elongated ( minor / major axis = 0.84 ) on the blue image , but no trace of this is found on the red image .",
    "another cluster that stands out in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] is w26 , the profile of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_profiles ] .",
    "this cluster is @xmath65 magnitudes fainter than w30 ( m97 ) , making it more difficult to measure the outer parts of its profile .",
    "this may perhaps explain the relatively abrupt truncation observed at @xmath66 ( @xmath67  pc ) , but alternatively the truncation could also be real (   [ subsec : tidal_radii ] ) .",
    "we measure @xmath68  pc and @xmath69  pc in the blue and red bands , respectively , which yields a straight average of @xmath70  pc .",

    ", we ran the fits with three initial guesses for @xmath37 , namely @xmath83 , 4.0 and 6.0 , and required the estimated values to converge to the same value for all initial guesses .    in this way",
    ", we were able to estimate @xmath37 values of 2.8 , 2.6 , 3.0 and 3.0 for w6 , s105 , s114 and w10 , respectively .",
    "these values are near to , although slightly steeper than , those derived for w3 , w30 and w26 . due to the similarity between the estimated @xmath37 values and that of @xmath32 adopted for estimating  for the full sample , the radii of these clusters do not differ significantly from those given in table  [ tab : catalogue ] .      given the extended envelopes around w3 , w30 and w26 , it is insightful to relate their extent to an estimate of the tidal radius for each cluster .",
    "the tidal radius can be estimated via @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mass of the cluster , @xmath86 the true distance from the galaxy centre , and @xmath87 the circular velocity within the galaxy at that distance ( von hoerner  1957 ) .",
    "this estimate assumes that the clusters are on circular orbits , and we approximate the true distance with the projected distance .",
    "if the clusters are located further away from the galaxy centre their tidal radii would be larger , and if the clusters move on radial or elliptical orbits ( i.e. , passing near the centre of the galaxy ) their tidal radii would be significantly smaller than estimated via the above equation and approximations . additionally , the above approximation may not be accurate if the three extended clusters are located at a true galactocentric distance near their projected one .",
    "in such a case , each cluster s extent would be a significant portion of the galactocentric distance , violating the initial assumptions of the approximation .    for the masses of w3 , w30 and",

    "we estimate the tidal radii of w3 , w30 and w26 to be approximately @xmath92  pc , @xmath93  pc and @xmath81  pc , respectively . given the various uncertainties associated with these estimates , the observed extents of the profiles of w3 , w30 and w26 given in table  1 appear largely consistent with the estimated tidal radii .",
    "specifically , the observed extents of the envelopes of w3 and w30 are at least equal to the estimated tidal radii and may exceed them , suggesting that either the true galactocentric distances of these two clusters exceed the projected distances significantly or there has been insufficient time for significant tidal erosion . the near agreement between the measured extent of w26 and the estimated tidal radius , on the other hand , suggests that the observed truncation may be tidal and real , rather than due to a measuring problem .",
    "our main conclusion is that the observed large extents and/or tidal radii of these clusters are due , at least in part , to the high cluster masses .",
    "hence , extremely extended profiles may be a common feature of very high - mass clusters .",
    "due to the large extent of w3 , w30 and w26 , we have also searched for tidal debris around each cluster .",

    "we can see that a the weakly varying background is not affecting our results ( e.g. , spiral structure , dust lanes , etc ) and that binning the profile of the clusters radially ( i.e. , averaging azimuthally ) does not hide structure",
    ". tidal features , while not visible in the surface brightness images , may still be present ; however the relatively bright background limits the possibility of detecting such structures with the present data .",
    "while we can not fit sbps for the other cluster candidates in our sample due to their lower s / n and blending with the background galaxy light , we have attempted to measure  for each of the candidates . for this",

    "there are three possible explanations for this difference .",
    "the first is that the difference is real and that our subsample of clusters in ngc  7252 is representative of the size distribution of the cluster population as a whole within this galaxy .",
    "the second possibility is that we have biased our sample by only considering well resolved clusters .",
    "this is certainly affecting our sample at some level : for example , if we assign all the unresolved clusters an effective radius of 2  pc , the median of the distribution is @xmath96  pc .",

    "many of the clusters in our sample have masses above @xmath97 , so their large sizes may simply be a reflection of their high masses .    in order to test this third possibility we searched for a mass  luminosity relation of the resolved cluster candidates that pass our colour selection .",

    "maz - apellniz  ( 2001 ) studied a sample of young ( @xmath12720  myr ) , relatively massive ( @xmath128 ) stellar aggregates in nearby galaxies with _ hst _ images .",
    "he found that he could broadly split his sample of 27 objects into three categories , with some overlap between them : star clusters with `` weak halos '' ( e.g. , ngc  3603 types ) , star clusters with `` strong halos '' ( e.g. , r136 types ) , and stellar aggregates that lack a distinct core ( e.g. , massive ob associations ) . within this categorization ,",
    "r136 , the ymc in ngc  6946 , knot s in the antennae and w3 , w30 and w26 in ngc  7252 would all be classified as clusters with `` strong halos '' .",
    "it is worth noting that all of the above galaxies with `` strong halo '' clusters also contain more compact `` weak halo '' clusters .",
    "it then appears that star clusters feature a range of outer profiles , with `` strong halos '' referring to clusters with shallow profiles , and `` weak halos '' to those with steep profiles .    as noted by maz - apellniz  ( 2001 )",
    ", the youth of many of the clusters and associations in his sample argues for the profile types to be due to the initial conditions during cluster formation rather than to dynamical processes after formation .",
    "do the profiles of clusters ( extended , truncated , steep or shallow ) vary systematically as a function of galactic location and environment ?",
    "if so , what is the dominating factor ?",
    "a systematic study of ymc profile types in nearby galaxies is required to answer these questions .",
    "while shallow and extended profiles have been found before for ymcs in a variety of galaxies ( see above ) , the extended envelopes seen in the clusters of ngc  7252 are remarkable for at least two reasons .",
    "the first is their sheer extent .",
    "the envelopes of w26 , w30 and w3 extend out to @xmath95150  pc , @xmath116250  pc and @xmath116500  pc , respectively . only knot s in the antennae",
    "compares in spatial extent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : knots ] ) .",
    "the second reason is the remarkable fact that these three clusters have been able to retain their extended envelopes for 300500  myr .",
    "knot s is only @xmath957  myr old and hence may lose its extended envelope over the next several 100  myr .",
    "similarly , one might expect the @xmath95400  myr old clusters in ngc  7252 to have lost their envelopes due to tidal truncation . that this did not occur for w3 , w30 and",
    "w26 is likely due to their extreme masses ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "interestingly , it is the lowest - mass cluster of these three , w26 ( @xmath130 ) that shows possible signs of tidal truncation at @xmath95150  pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_profiles ] and   [ subsec : tidal_radii ] ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of _ hst_/wfc3 images of the galactic merger remnant ngc  7252 . in particular",
    ", we have focussed on the structure and effective radii of the young massive clusters that formed during the merger .",
    "we have been able to resolve clusters down to @xmath131  pc , despite the 64  mpc distance to the host galaxy .",
    "the average effective radius of the resolved clusters in our sample is @xmath1327  pc , significantly larger than for ymcs in normal galaxies , although we note that this may be caused by the fact that we can not resolve the smallest clusters .",
    "we have found some evidence for a relation between the effective radius and mass for clusters with masses @xmath133 , and also tentative evidence for a relation between the effective radius and galactocentric distance , with clusters with larger projected distances having larger effective radii .    for three of the brightest clusters , w3 , w30 and w26 , we have been able to measure surface - brightness profiles and constrain the structural parameters .",
    "we find that all three have power - law envelopes , well fit by eff profiles to near the limit of measurability .",
    "these envelopes extend out to @xmath116500  pc , @xmath116250  pc , and @xmath95150  pc , for w3 , w30 , and w26 , respectively .",
    "only the envelope of w26 shows a sign of being truncated ( at @xmath95150  pc ) , but whether this apparent truncation is real and tidal , or due to imperfect background subtraction , can not presently be established with certainty .",
    "we note that it has been possible to trace the profiles out to these large distances mainly because of the brightness ( high mass ) of these three clusters and the relatively low and smooth background of the host galaxy .",
    "we have compared these three measured profiles to those of other ymcs found in the literature .",
    "a number of young clusters are known to also feature extended profiles , but only one  knot s in the antennae galaxies  extends as far out as those of the three ngc  7252 clusters .",
    "it is interesting to compare knot  s with clusters w3 , w30 and w26 , due to the youth of its central region ( @xmath121  myr ) .",
    "the envelope of knot  s contains a number of subclusters that may disrupt over the next few hundred myr , leaving a smooth halo , as observed in the ngc  7252 clusters .",
    "the subclusters in knot  s show an age spread of @xmath118  myr .",
    "hence , if the progenitors of w3 and its siblings resemble knot  s , we may expect similar age spreads within them as well .",
    "the similarities between w3 , knot  s , and other ymcs with extended envelopes suggest that the envelopes and their substructures are primordial in nature .",
    "other very young clusters , such as ngc  3603 in the galaxy , appear to form with a distinct truncation .",
    "we speculate that the difference may stem from the gas distributions at the time when star formation begins : gaseous cores distinct from their surroundings may form truncated star clusters , while core ",
    "cloud continua may form clusters with extended envelopes .    in the process of our analysis",
    ", we have estimated the tidal radii of the three extended clusters in ngc 7252 from their estimated masses and projected galactocentric distances , assuming that the clusters move on circular orbits .",
    "we find that these tidal radii are comparable to the observed extents of the profiles .",
    "this may explain why these very massive clusters ( @xmath134 ) were able to retain their extended envelopes for several hundred myr .",
    "other young clusters that display extended envelopes , such as r136 in the lmc or the ymc in ngc  6946 , may lose their envelopes more quickly due to their lower masses and more disk - like environments .",
