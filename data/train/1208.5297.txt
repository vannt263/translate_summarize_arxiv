    "key properties of the evolution equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be summarised as follows : ( i ) it preserves the overall probability so that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "this can be checked by verifying the relation @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) unlike a unitary time evolution , it does not in general preserve the purity of the state . in particular , we have @xmath19 and in general the right side of ( [ eq:6 ] ) is nonzero when @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the purity of the initial state is not preserved by ( [ eq:1 ] ) when @xmath21 is not a fixed point of the dynamics , but an initially pure state will remain pure . when @xmath22 , we have the relation @xmath23 from which it follows that : ( iii ) the imaginary part @xmath4 of the hamiltonian drives every state towards the ground state of @xmath4 .",
    "( iv ) the evolution equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) preserves the positivity of @xmath21 , and is ` autonomous ' in the sense that the dynamical trajectory in the space of density matrices is determined uniquely by the specification of the initial density matrix @xmath11 , and is not dependent on the kind of probabilistic mixture the initial state might represent .",
    "( v ) in the case of a unitary motion , the speed @xmath24 of the evolution of the state is constant of motion and is given by the wigner - yanase skew information @xmath25 @xcite , which reduces to the anandan - aharonov relation @xmath26 for pure states @xmath27 .",
    "when the dynamics is governed by a complex hamiltonian @xmath28 , the evolution speed is not a constant of motion and is given by the expression @xmath29\\rho ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + 2 \\left ( { \\rm tr}({\\mathit\\gamma}^2\\rho )   + { \\rm tr}({\\mathit\\gamma}\\sqrt{\\rho}{\\mathit\\gamma}\\sqrt{\\rho } ) -2 \\big ( { \\rm tr } ( { \\mathit\\gamma}\\rho ) \\big)^2 \\right ) , \\label{eq:8 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath30\\rangle$ ] for pure states .",
    "next we identify the fixed points of the dynamics .",
    "we begin by the following elementary observation concerning eigenstates of a generic complex hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "suppose that @xmath32 is a normalised eigenstate of @xmath33 : @xmath34 then , if @xmath35 , where @xmath36 real , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in particular , an eigenfunction @xmath32 of a complex hamiltonian @xmath33 has a real eigenvalue if and only if @xmath39 . with this in mind , we establish the following results : ( vi ) every eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath33 , irrespective of whether the eigenvalue is real , is a fixed point of the motion ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "they are the only stationary states that are pure .",
    "( vii ) the mixed stationary states of the dynamical equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) consist of convex combinations of the eigenstates of the the hamiltonian @xmath33 associated with _ real _ eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , the totality of mixed stationary states lies on the subspace of density matrices for which @xmath40 .",
    "eigenstate of @xmath33 with eigenvalue @xmath42 , then we have @xmath43 and hence @xmath44 . putting these together",
    ", it follows that @xmath45 . to establish ( vii )",
    "we set @xmath46 where @xmath47 are nonnegative numbers adding to unity , @xmath48 are eigenstates of @xmath33 with real eigenvalues , and @xmath49 is the number of real eigenvalues . substituting ( [ eq:11 ] ) in ( [ eq:5 ] ) , a short calculation shows that @xmath50 . to show that the stationarity breaks down",
    "if the convex combination contains eigenstates with complex eigenvalues , suppose that we add terms in ( [ eq:11 ] ) associated with complex eigenvalues .",
    "then from ( [ eq:5 ] ) we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "since at least one of the @xmath53 is nonzero by assumption , it follows that @xmath54 . finally , since all terms in ( [ eq:11 ] ) have the property that latexmath:[$\\langle\\phi_k|{\\mathit\\gamma }       a corollary to ( [ eq:12 ] ) is that : ( viii ) if the initial state @xmath11 admits an eigenfunction expansion such that one or more terms are associated with complex eigenvalues , then @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the member of the eigenfunctions @xmath58 in the expansion for which the associated imaginary part @xmath59 of the eigenvalue takes maximum value .",
    "hence the flow structure in the space of density matrices , when there are imaginary eigenvalues , is rather complex and intricate in higher dimensions , where for each eigenstate @xmath60 associated with an imaginary eigenvalue there is a continuum of states for which @xmath60 is an asymptotic attractor .",
    "if , however , there is no real eigenvalue at all , then this segmentation disappears and the eigenstate with the largest @xmath61 becomes the single attractor .    to investigate the behaviour in the pt - symmetric phase where all eigenvalues are real ,",
    "let us put @xmath62 then the trace condition @xmath63 implies that @xmath64 since the eigenfunctions are not orthogonal when @xmath65 . substituting ( [ eq:14 ] ) in ( [ eq:5 ] ) we find @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "we thus deduce the following : ( ix ) when all eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath33 are real , every orbit is periodic if the energy eigenvalues are commensurable ; otherwise , the evolution is typically ergodic on a small toroidal subspace of the space of density matrices containing @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in the pt - symmetric phase , dynamical features of the system are analogous to those of a unitary system , albeit differences in detail such as the lack of constancy of the evolution speed .",
    "the similarity is due to the fact that the nonlinearity of ( [ eq:1 ] ) is merely to preserve @xmath68 ; hence the evolution equation can not generate nontrivial fixed points such as saddle points .    in figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    "we illustrate integral curves of ( [ eq:1 ] ) for a two - level example system with the hamiltonian @xmath69 , where @xmath61 is a real parameter .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of @xmath33 are given by @xmath70 .",
    "hence the symmetry is broken if @xmath71 .",
    "observe that in the unbroken phase the orbits are periodic , and hence the purity of mixed states oscillates , while in the broken phase every mixed state is asymptotically purified to the ground state . to visualise the effect of the phase transition it will be useful to introduce an ` order parameter ' @xmath49 by the time average of @xmath72 : @xmath73 note that @xmath49 is independent of the choice of the initial condition @xmath11 . in figure  [ fig:2.1 ] we",
    "plot @xmath49 as a function of @xmath74 , showing the characteristic behaviour of the order parameter in a second - order phase transition .",
    "perhaps a surprising feature of the foregoing analysis is the observation that in the broken phase where eigenvalues are complex , convex combinations of energy eigenstates are not stationary . on account of the fact that the dynamical equation is autonomous",
    ", this implies , in particular , that if an initial state @xmath11 is chosen randomly out of the eigenstates @xmath75 , each one of which is stationary , and the system evolves under the presence of gain and loss such that pt symmetry is broken , then after a passage of time the statistics obtained from @xmath76 are different from those obtained from @xmath11 .",
    "this feature has no analogue in the standard unitary theory , and can be used to test the applicability of the model ( [ eq:1 ] ) in laboratory experiments , provided that a coherent control of the system , in such a way that gain and loss can be balanced without perturbing the system , is possible .    if , on the other hand , a coherent implementation of gain and loss is not feasible , either because of fundamental quantum limits or current technological limits , then it is important to take into account additional effects arising from random perturbations . for this purpose",
    ", we shall assume that the model ( [ eq:1 ] ) remains valid , but in addition the system is perturbed at random .",
    "specifically , we assume that the state is perturbed by gaussian white noise in every orthogonal direction in the space of pure states , with strength @xmath77 , where @xmath78 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that such a perturbation , when averaged out , generates a flow in the space of density matrices given by @xmath79 ; this , in turn , leads to the extended model : @xmath80 - \\big ( [ { \\mathit\\gamma},\\rho]_+ - 2\\ , { \\rm tr } ( \\rho{\\mathit\\gamma } ) \\rho \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + \\kappa \\left ( { \\mathds 1}-n \\rho \\right ) ,   \\label{eq:18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath81 is the hilbert space dimensionality .",
    "we proceed to analyse properties of ( [ eq:18 ] ) .",
    "to begin , it should be evident that : ( i ) the evolution equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) preserves the overall probability so that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . on account of the presence of noise",
    ", however , an initially pure state ceases to remain pure .",
    "in particular , we have : ( ii ) the evolution of the purity is governed by the equation @xmath82 notice that when @xmath8 the first term in the right side of ( [ eq:19 ] ) vanishes , whereas the second term is negative .",
    "hence an initially pure state necessarily evolves into a mixed state due to noise .",
    "( iii ) when @xmath13 , the solution to the dynamical equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) takes the form @xmath83 ,   \\label{eq:20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and has a single fixed point @xmath84 .",
    "this can be seen from the facts that the off diagonal elements of @xmath79 are negative , and that the diagonal elements are positive ( _ reps_. negative ) if the diagonal element of @xmath21 is less than ( _ reps_. larger than ) @xmath85 .",
    "the effect of the term @xmath79 therefore is to generate a gradient flow towards the uniformly mixed state @xmath84 .",
    "( iv ) like the model ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the evolution equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) is positive and autonomous in the sense described above .",
    "( v ) the dynamical equation satisfied by an observable @xmath14 is given by @xmath86\\rangle - \\langle[{\\mathit\\gamma},f]_+ \\rangle + 2\\ , \\langle{\\mathit\\gamma}\\rangle \\langle f\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\kappa   \\big ( { \\rm tr}(f)-n\\langle f\\rangle \\big ) .",
    "\\label{eq:21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to gain insights into fixed - point structures of the extended model ( [ eq:18 ] ) we have performed numerical studies based on a two - level system with the hamiltonian @xmath69 .",
    "our analysis shows that once the noise strength @xmath87 is turned on , irrespective of its magnitude , the phase transition is suppressed .",
    "this can be seen by the consideration of the order parameter @xmath49 . as indicated above , in the noise - free case",
    "there is a clear indication of a second - order phase transition at the critical point @xmath88 . under a noisy environment , however , the symmetry is broken for all values of @xmath89 ; instead , for each value of @xmath90 an equilibrium state @xmath91 is established , to which every initial state converges . in figure  [ fig:2.2 ]",
    "we plot @xmath49 as a function of @xmath74 for a range of values for @xmath92 , showing the removal of the phase transition , although for sufficiently small @xmath87 the signature of the transition is visible . we have performed further numerical and analytical studies of the evolution equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) , the results of which indicate that the emergence of a nontrivial equilibrium state is a generic feature of the model .    in summary , we have introduced a model for describing the evolution of a density matrix for a system having gain and loss , and investigated its properties in detail . in particular , we have identified the associated stationary states , and shown the existence of phase transitions in the generic mixed - state context ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig:2.1 ] ) .",
    "we then extended the model to include a noise term , and showed evidences for the existence of equilibrium states that eliminate phase transitions ( cf .",

    "the applicability of our models is expected to be verifiable in laboratory experiments ."

    "<S> this is in part motivated by the realisation that when a system is placed in a configuration in which its energy or amplitude is transferred into its environment through one channel , but at the same time is amplified by the same amount through another channel , the resulting dynamics can exhibit features that are similar to those seen in hamiltonian dynamical systems . </S>",

    "<S> they can be related to pure state evolutions with complex hamiltonians , but typically involve stochastic terms @xcite that distinguish them from the complex schrdinger equation . in particular , an initially pure state tends to evolve into a mixed state due to the influence of noise . </S>",
