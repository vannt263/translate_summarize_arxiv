    "the quiescent emission of soft x  ray transients ( sxrts ) has been investigated for only 56 sources ( e.g. , verbunt et al . 1994 ; asai et al .",
    "1996 ) ; this is characterized in all cases by very soft spectra ( black body temperatures of a few hundreds of ev ) and x  ray luminosities of @xmath0 .",
    "cen x-4 is one of the nearest ( @xmath1 kpc ) and best studied sxrt .",
    "two outbursts have been observed from cen  x-4 in 1969 and 1979 .",
    "the most detailed observation of cen x-4 during quiescence is the one recently obtained with asca by asai et al .",
    "these authors reported a quiescent luminosity of @xmath2   ( 0.510 kev ) .",
    "the x  ray spectrum measured is well fit by a black body component ( @xmath3 kev ; @xmath4 cm ) plus a power - law with a photon index of 23 .",
    "the contribution of these two spectral components in the asca energy band is comparable .",
    "here we report on a rosat hri observation of cen x-4 during the quiescent period .",
    "the rosat high resolution imager ( hri ; david et al .",
    "1992 ) observed cen x-4 between 1995 august 16 and 26 , for a net exposure time of 17469 s. the brightest of the @xmath5 x  ray sources detected in the field is at coordinates 14h 58 m 21s.8 , @xmath6 ( j2000 ) , fully compatible ( @xmath7 ) with the position of cen x-4 reported by van paradijs ( 1993 ) .",
    "the average hri count rate of @xmath8 counts s@xmath9 corresponds to a signal to noise ratio of 12 . by adopting the black body plus power law model derived from the asca fit ( asai et al .",
    "1996 ) and a column density @xmath10   as estimated by van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1987 ) based on the optical reddening , we predict an hri count rate of @xmath11 counts s@xmath9 .",
    "this is in agreement with our measurement and indicates that the average source luminosity is at a level similar to that measured with asca @xmath12 months earlier . for these spectral parameters and a distance of 1.2 kpc",
    ", this count rate corresponds to a 0.12.4 kev x  ray luminosity of @xmath13 .    to study the source variability , we extracted 393 counts contained in a circle of @xmath14 radius centered on the source position .",
    "a periodicity search was carried out spanning periods from 10 ms to 100 s , with negative results .",
    "the corresponding upper limits are poor ( pulsed fraction @xmath15 , assuming a sinusoidal modulation ) due to the high number of selected frequencies and the limited number of counts .    .rosat hri observation log . [ cols=\"^,^,>,^ \" , ]     if the search is restricted around the 32 hz periodicity reported by mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the asca gis light curves , then an upper limit of 80% on the pulsed fraction is derived averaging together 6 power spectra of different time intervals , spanning 10 indipendent frequencies between 31.2498 and 31.2502 ms .",
    "significant aperiodic variability is clearly detected on a timescale of days .",
    "indeed , a flux variation is apparent by comparing the cen x-4 count rates obtained from the three separate time intervals of which the rosat observation is composed ( see table 1 and figure 1 ) . in the first interval a relatively high level of emission is observed , consistent with a flare - like event .",
    "this count rate variation affects mainly the soft channels of the hri . in the other two intervals , separated by @xmath16 days each ,",
    "the source count rate is a factor of 34 lower and its flux is consistent with a constant value .",
    "in a reanalysis of the einstein ipc ( on 1980 july 28 ) and exosat le ( on 1986 february 21 ) observations of cen x-4 , we find that both are consistent with a single value of the x  ray luminosity for spectral parameters comparable to those of asca ( asai et al .",
    "1996 ) , hinting to a constant x ",
    "ray luminosity over 15 years .",
    "therefore the decrease in the x  ray luminosity found by van paradijs et al .",
    "( 1987 ) assuming a 1 to 5 kev bremsstrahlung spectrum seems less likely .",
    "our rosat hri observation of cen x-4 provides also the first evidence for a flux variation on a timescale of a few days in the quiescent flux of a sxrt .",
    "this variation is likely intrinsic to the source ( no occultations or dips have ever been observed ) and therefore it can help constraining the emission mechanisms during quiescence ( stella et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the possibility that the late type companion star accounts for the observed luminosity has been excluded by verbunt ( 1996 ) .",
    "neutron star cooling is attractive in view of the spectral results consistent with thermal emission from a body of size comparable with a neutron star , however it is incompatible with the observed rapid decrease in the source intensity .",
    "also the shock emission model in which the x  ray luminosity is produced by the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind with gaseous material from the companion star encounters problems . the mechanism is likely at work in psr 125963 , where the x  ray spectrum is characterized by a power - law with photon index of @xmath17 extending from 0.1 to 200 kev ( e.g. tavani & arons 1996 ) . in the case of cen x-4 however , besides the power - law component , also a black body component is present .",
    "moreover , the hri count rate variation is mainly observed in the soft channels , where the black body component dominates .",
    "we believe that the most likely explanation for the quiescent flux of cen x-4 is that it derives from mass accretion . in this",
    "case variations in the accretion flow can easily explain the observed changes .",
    "either accretion onto the neutron star surface and onto the magnetosphere can explain the observed properties , leaving open the possibility that cen x-4 contains a fast spinning , weakly magnetized neutron star ( stella et al ."
