    "recent experiments suggest that the combination of icy grain mantles and uv irradiation efficiently produces the complex molecules found around protostars @xcite , and surely appropriate conditions are common in disks as well @xcite .",
    "the chemistry in disks is significantly more difficult to probe than in protostellar cores because of their order - of - magnitude smaller angular size , which necessitates the use of ( sub-)millimeter arrays to resolve the chemistry of the bulk of the disk material .",
    "the first observations of disk chemistry by @xcite also revealed lower gas - phase abundances of most molecules compared to protostars . from a slightly larger sample consisting of four sources",
    "@xcite showed that protoplanetary disks seem to generally contain orders of magnitude lower gas abundances compared to protostellar cores .",
    "this is reproduced by models of disks with a combination of freeze - out onto grains toward the disk midplane and photodissociation in the disk atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the low molecular abundances result in weak emission that requires long integration times at all existing ( sub-)millimeter facilities .",
    "the investment required for interferometers in large part explains the small number of resolved chemistry studies of any species more complicated than hco@xmath4 @xcite .    despite these impediments , single dish studies of the t tauri stars dm tau , gg tau , lkca 15 , tw hya , v4046 sgr and the herbig ae stars mwc 480 and hd 163296 have provided some constraints on the chemistry of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",

    "overall , the combination of small samples of diverse sources and even fewer resolved studies have so far prevented any strong constraints on the main source of chemical diversity in protoplanetary disks .    with the discs ( disk imaging survey of chemistry with sma ) submillimeter array legacy program",
    ", we aim to produce a resolved , systematic survey of chemistry toward protoplanetary disks spanning a range of spectral types and disk parameters .",
    "the targeted molecules are the simple species that previous studies suggested may be detectable ( co , hco@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 , cn , hcn , dcn , n@xmath7h@xmath4 , c@xmath10h@xmath7 , h@xmath7co and ch@xmath10oh ) .",
    "the initial survey contains six well known disks in the taurus molecular clouds ( dm tau , aa tau , lkca 15 , gm aur , cq tau and mwc 480 ) with central stars that span spectral types m1 to a4 .",
    "the disk sample is presented in @xmath14[sec : sample ] with special attention to the properties that may affect the disk chemistry such as stellar luminosity , accretion rates , disk size , disk structure and dust settling .",

    "the channel maps toward one of the richest sources , moment maps for all disks in the most abundant species , and spectra of all detected lines toward all sources are shown in @xmath14[sec : res ] .",
    "the detection rates as well as source - to - source variations are discussed in section @xmath14[sec : disc ] followed by qualitative discussions on the origins of the observed chemical variations .",
    "the taurus discs sample of protoplanetary disks was chosen to assess the impact of spectral type or stellar irradiation field on the chemistry in the disk .",
    "the target systems span the full range of stellar luminosities among the t tauri and herbig ae stars associated with the taurus molecular cloud .",
    "table  [ tbl : star ] lists the stellar properties .",
    "the stellar masses in the sample range between 0.5 and 1.82.3 m@xmath15 , corresponding to luminosities that span almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "if stellar luminosity is the main driver of the outer disk chemical evolution , then this sample should display a range of chemical behaviors .",
    "as discussed below there are other sources of radiation that may affect the chemistry as well , especially accretion luminosity and x - rays .",
    "the sample is biased toward disks of large angular extent , since disks smaller than a few hundred au are not spatially resolved by the sma in the compact configuration .",
    "the observations are not sensitive to gas inside of 100  au , which entails that there is a large gap in radii between these millimeter observations and infrared disk chemistry observations that typically probe the inner disk out to a few aus .",
    "the sources were selected from disks previously mapped in co and thus may be biased toward gas - rich disks .",
    "furthermore only disks clearly isolated from the parent cloud emission are included to reduce confusion and ensure that the detected molecules reside in the disks .",
    "known harborers of organic molecules were favored ( dm tau , lkca 15 and mwc 480 ) , but the sample also contains disks that have only upper limits or that have not been investigated for molecular lines other than co. the focus on a single star forming region allows us to probe disks of similar ages and likely similar chemical starting points , reducing the sources of chemical variation .",
    "stellar luminosity , accretion luminosity , x - rays , the interstellar irradiation field , disk geometry , disk gaps and holes , dust settling and dust growth may all affect the chemistry in the disk . the sample characteristics in terms of these properties are discussed in this section .",
    "observations of high cn and hcn abundances toward protoplanetary disks reveal that a chemistry controlled by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) or x - ray radiation or both must contribute to the observed abundances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fuv radiation below 2000    affects the chemistry by directly heating the gas in the disk surface layers , in limiting molecular abundances via photodissociation , increasing the amount of photochemistry products such as cn and liberating frozen species via photodesorption .",
    "the nature of the dominating source of radiation is however unknown .",
    "the quiescent stellar luminosities in the sample range from 0.25 to 11.5 l@xmath15 , and if quiescent fuv radiation controls the photodissociation rate in the disk surface , then there should be a clear trend in the cn / hcn ratio between the low - luminosity t tauri stars and the order of magnitude more luminous herbig ae stars . however , kurucz ( 1993 ) stellar atmosphere models show evidence that stars with a spectral type later than f do not have significant stellar continuum @xmath162000    above that generated by accretion , and that it is only for a stars that stellar uv becomes more significant than accretion luminosity for the fuv field .",
    "this is confirmed by fuv observations toward the t tauri star tw hya , which is dominated by line emission generated from accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "the accretion fuv spectrum is dominated by line emission and especially ly-@xmath17 emission , which results in preferential hcn dissociation and therefore boosts the cn / hcn ratio @xcite beyond what is expected from a uv chemistry dominated by continuum radiation . toward t tauri stars ,",
    "the fuv flux is expected to scale with the accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion rates probably vary over time however , as has been observed toward tw hya , where @xcite found mass accretion rates between 10@xmath18 ",
    "10@xmath19 m@xmath20 yr@xmath2 during a year and smaller variations on timescales of days .",
    "the measured accretion rate variability among the t tauri stars in this sample are all within this range and it is unclear whether the average accretion luminosity vary significantly among the sources . in general more massive systems have higher accretion rates @xcite and it can therefore be expected that the fuv flux from accretion will be higher toward the intermediate mass herbig ae stars in the sample . as mentioned above , for the early type stars ( e.g. a ) the stellar continuum also adds a significant contribution to the fuv radiation field",
    "thus , even if accretion rather than quiescent luminosity controls the uv chemistry , one would expect to observe a higher cn / hcn ratio toward the more massive stars .",
    "observations of the fuv field in t tauri systems find that accretion produces uv fluxes that are a few hundred to a thousand times stronger than the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) at 100 au @xcite .",
    "the isrf may still be important at large radii , however .",
    "the external irradiation field is presumed to be constant toward the taurus sample of sources , i.e. none of the disks are close to any o or b stars , but its impact may differ between the different classes of sources ; the isrf may play a larger role in driving the chemistry for the low luminosity objects , thus acting as a chemical equalizer .",
    "a fourth possible driver of the disk chemistry is x - rays , which is predicted to be important for the ionization fraction in the disk @xcite .",
    "x - rays are mainly attenuated by gas , while continuum uv photons are quickly absorbed by dust @xcite .",
    "x - rays can therefore penetrate deeper into the disk compared to uv rays , and may be a main driver of both ion chemistry and molecular dissociation .",
    "this may result in observable differences in the molecular distribution if the chemistry is driven by x - rays instead of uv radiation .",
    "for individual objects x - ray measurements are notoriously variable and assessing their impact observationally may be possible only through monitoring of the x - ray flux and the chemical variation toward a single system @xcite .",
    "on average the x - ray fluxes seem higher toward t tauri stars compared to herbig ae stars and thus ion - driven chemical reactions may be faster in disks around t tauri stars @xcite .    regardless of whether the quiescent luminosity of the central star is the main source of energetic radiation , it may still control the disk temperature and thus the temperature sensitive chemistry , e.g. deuterium fractionation efficiency probed by the dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 ratio .",
    "the stellar continuum photons are expected to be the primary agent for heating grains in the disk , particularly toward the midplane , setting the overall reservoir of warm or cold grains in the outer disk to which the sma is most sensitive . both the level of gas phase depletion and the chemistry dependent on co depletion",
    "may then be regulated by the stellar continuum flux .",
    "for example a tracer of co freeze - out such as the n@xmath7h@xmath4/hco@xmath4 ratio is expected to be higher toward low - luminosity systems @xcite .    the disk structure and dust properties",
    "determine how much of the stellar radiation is intercepted by the disk and the penetration depth of that radiation .",
    "these disk properties may be equally important to the the strength of the radiation field for the chemical evolution in the disk .",
    "table [ tbl : disk ] list the sample disk characteristics from previous co and continuum observations and modeling .",
    "position angles and inclinations do not affect the chemistry intrinsically , but the disk inclination affects which parts of the disk are observed , and thus our view of the chemistry .",
    "the sizes of the disks are described in terms of co gas disk radii and range from 200 to 890  au .",
    "disk masses are less well constrained , since they are derived from dust emission assuming a dust - to - gas ratio . in most studies the canonical interstellar dust - to - gas ratios of 1 to 100 is used .",
    "the actual dust - to - gas ratio may be different because of dust coagulation and photoevaporation , and also variable among the sources .",
    "still it seems clear that two of the disks , aa tau and cq tau , are significantly less massive than lkca 15 , gm aur and mwc 480 , while dm tau falls in between ( table [ tbl : disk ] ) .",
    "this difference in disk mass may affect their relative abundances of different species , since more massive disks are expected to contain more cold material per unit of incoming irradiation .",
    "three of the sample disks are so - called transition and pre - transition disks ( dm tau , gm aur and lkca 15 ) with large inner holes or gaps @xcite . from a _",
    "survey of disk chemistry many transition disks , including gm aur and lkca 15 have co gas in the disk hole @xcite .",
    "they do however lack emission from hcn and c@xmath7h@xmath7 transitions in the _ inner _ disk that are strong toward classical t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether this is a chemistry or gas - mass effect .",
    "it is also unknown whether the chemistry in the outer regions of these transition disks differ significantly from classical t tauri disks , although it is curious that these systems are the most chemically rich in terms of the outer disk seen to date .",
    "this may be explained by increased radiation fluxes ; more stellar radiation may reach the outer disk the larger the hole .",
    "in addition , large holes may be a tracer of overall grain growth and thus of increased uv penetration depth in both the inner and outer disk .",
    "grain properties can be traced by the millimeter slope of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , parameterized by the power - law index of the opacity spectrum , @xmath21 , and this is the last disk characteristic listed in table [ tbl : disk ] .",
    "the index @xmath21 is predicted to decrease with grain growth and the disks in the survey all have @xmath21 below the expected 1.7 for interstellar grains @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 estimates are however different between different studies , which makes it difficult to conclude on an order of dust coagulation among the disks , but aa tau seems to have a significantly lower @xmath21 compared to the other t tauri disks .",
    "most of the sources have also been observed by spitzer in studies that constrain the grain properties in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "these measurements do not provide any straightforward constraints on the grain properties in the outer disk probed by the sma , however .",
    "finally the disk structure , e.g. the amount of flaring , affects the amount of stellar light intercepted by the disk .",
    "the disk structure , parameterized by the dust scale height , can be constrained by modeling the sed , though degeneracy is a problem @xcite . as the dust settles towards the midplane the dust scale height decreases compared to the gas scale height .",
    "five of the sample disk seds were modeled by @xcite , who concluded that mwc 480 and lkca 15 are more settled than cq tau , gm aur and aa tau , i.e. in the disks of mwc 480 and lkca 15 the upper disk layers are significantly depleted in micron - sized dust grains .",
    "this has been confirmed in more recent studies that find significantly less settling toward gm aur compared to lkca 15 @xcite .",
    "two frequency setups per source were selected to cover 4 to 8 spectral lines in each setup , at the same time providing continuum observations .",
    "the targeted molecules are dco@xmath4 and dcn ( probing deuterium chemistry ) , cn and hcn ( probing photochemistry ) , hco@xmath4 and n@xmath7h@xmath4 ( ions ) , h@xmath7co and ch@xmath10oh ( potential grain chemistry products ) , @xmath12-c@xmath10h@xmath7 ( carbon - chain chemistry ) and co ( the disk kinematic tracer ) . tables  [ tbl : setup1 ] and  [ tbl : setup2 ] summarizes the two spectral setups , centered at 1.1 mm and 1.4 mm , respectively .",
    "the sma correlator covers @xmath22  ghz bandwidth in each of the two sidebands using two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands with widths of 1.968 ghz .",
    "the first if band is centered at 5 ghz , and the second if band is centered at 7 ghz .",
    "each band is divided into 24 slightly overlapping `` chunks '' of 104 mhz width , which can have different spectral resolution . for each spectral",
    "setting , the correlator was configured to increase the spectral resolution on the key species with 128256 channels per chunk , with the exception of one h@xmath7co line observed with 64 channels .",
    "chunks containing weaker lines were then binned to obtain higher signal to noise , while still recovering sufficient kinetic information .",
    "the remaining chunks were covered by 64 channels each and used to measure the continuum .",
    "the continuum visibilities in each sideband and each if band were generated by averaging the central 82 mhz in all line - free chunks .",

    "the subsequent sections provide more details on the observed cn / hcn ratios , ions and deuterated molecules and their variation among the surveyed disks .    in general , we do not attempt to estimate column densities of molecules , but rather present the data in terms of integrated fluxes and flux ratios .",
    "the line fluxes and column densities are of course related , but the fluxes also depend on excitation temperatures and opacities . determining molecular column densities therefore requires knowledge of the disk structure and the spatial distribution of molecules . even for optically thin lines , estimated column densities may be off by an order of magnitude or more if the wrong emission regions / temperatures are adopted . for optically thick lines",
    "the estimates become even more uncertain and single dish studies including @xmath24co and h@xmath24co@xmath4 have shown that the emission from @xmath25co and h@xmath25co@xmath4 is mostly optically thick @xcite . a proper derivation of column densities",
    "therefore requires detailed chemical modeling of the disks , which we anticipate for a future discs publication .",

    "are related by @xmath38\\varpropto f[{\\rm jy}]\\times\\lambda^2[{\\rm mm^2}]$ ] . using partition functions , level energies and line strengths from cdms and assuming the same excitation conditions for hco@xmath4 32 and co 21 the [ hco@xmath4]/[co ] ratio is @xmath40 toward cq tau for excitation temperatures of 1875  k.    the n@xmath7h@xmath4 observations toward dm tau , lkca 15 and gm aur ( and tentatively toward aa tau ) provide unambiguous detections of this species in protoplanetary disks , confirming previous claims by @xcite .",
    "since n@xmath7h@xmath4 and dco@xmath4 both potentially trace the chemistry further toward the midplane compared to the more abundant molecules , their ratio provides important constraints on the cold chemistry in disks .",
    "the dco@xmath4/n@xmath7h@xmath4 line intensity ratio ranges from @xmath160.1 toward gm aur to 0.8 toward dm tau ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] ) .",
    "in contrast , there is no significant variation in the h@xmath7co / n@xmath7h@xmath4 ratio between the sources . assuming that these molecules always reside in the colder regions of the disks , these differences in flux ratios suggest relative abundance variations of n@xmath7h@xmath4 and dco@xmath4 of an order of magnitude between the different sources .",
    "because of the high optical depth of the hco@xmath4 line emission , the dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 line intensity ratio can only be used to derive upper limits on the average hco@xmath4 deuteration fraction in the disk .",
    "the analysis is further complicated by evidence of different emission regions of dco@xmath4 and hco@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "assuming , however , the same emission region of dco@xmath4 and hco@xmath4 and optically thin emission for both ions , the upper limits on the deuteration fraction is calculated using eq . [ eq : ratio ] to vary between 0.32 toward dm tau , 0.18 toward lkca 15 and @xmath160.07 toward gm aur .",
    "an excitation temperature of 19 k is assumed , but the ratios are only marginally affected by the excitation temperature between 10 and 50  k. the variable ratios hint at differences in deuteration fractionation between different sources , especially since gm aur has both lowest dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 and dco@xmath4/n@xmath7h@xmath4 ratios , but radiative transfer modeling is needed to confirm this result .",
    "dcn is only detected toward lkca 15 .",
    "the detection is at the @xmath415-@xmath26 level , and the moment maps shows an almost perfectly aligned velocity field compared to co and hco@xmath4 and the detection appears secure . from the cn analysis above and previous single - dish observations ,",
    "hcn line emission is expected to be much less optically thick than hco@xmath4 emission and the dcn / hcn ratio should provide stricter limits on the deuteration level in the disk . assuming optically thin emission , the same emission region for dcn and hcn and an excitation temperature of @xmath040  k , the upper limit on average deuteration in the disk around lkca 15 is 0.06 , a factor of three lower than the estimate from dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 .",
    "the reported images and spectra were acquired with only 37 hours on source integration , with the shorter time spent in the 1.1 mm setting .",
    "the detection rate of n@xmath7h@xmath4 and h@xmath7co in the 1.1 mm setting is then quite remarkable and can be attributed to the advantages of targeting higher @xmath42 lines when probing disks . for comparison",
    ", n@xmath7h@xmath4 was previously detected toward dm tau and lkca 15 through its 10 line using the plateau de bure interferometer , with peak fluxes @xmath160.02 jy @xcite , an order of magnitude or more lower than the @xmath43 line peak fluxes reported here .",
    "the 1 - 0 line in lkca 15 was also detected by @xcite using the owens valley radio observatory millimeter array with integrated intensity four times larger than that with the pdbi .",
    "the agreement with previous single - dish observations is generally good .",
    "all targeted molecular lines that have been previously reported in the single dish studies of dm tau , lkca 15 and mwc 480 are also detected with the sma @xcite .",
    "where the same lines have been studied , most integrated intensities agree .",
    "hcn @xmath44 toward dm tau is an exception , where the reported upper limit in @xcite is a factor of two below the intensity observed with the sma .    using their detections , @xcite derived [ n@xmath7h@xmath4]/[hco@xmath4 ] ratios of 0.020.03 for dm tau and lkca 15 by fitting the line emission to disk models . without such modeling",
    "we can only derive upper limits on the [ n@xmath7h@xmath4]/[hco@xmath4 ] of 0.130.19 for the two disks because of the hco@xmath4 line optical depth .",
    "considering that the hco@xmath4 abundance may be underestimated by up to an order of magnitude , the two data sets are consistent . within the same observational program @xcite searched for co 21 and",
    "hco@xmath4 10 emission toward cq tau and used the data to derive an upper limit on the [ hco@xmath4]/[co ] abundance ratio . assuming the same co and hco@xmath4 distribution and excitation conditions and optically thin co emission they find [ co]/[hco@xmath4]@xmath414@xmath45 .",
    "this is consistent with the abundance ratio of 10@xmath46 reported above , which is calculated making similar assumptions , but without the detailed modeling in @xcite .",
    "cq tau is by far the most chemically poor of the investigated disks .",
    "it is interesting that despite the low abundances , the chemistry appears normal , the ratios of the integrated intensities toward mwc 480 and cq tau are the same within a factor of two , including the cn / hcn emission ratio .",
    "the only difference is that overall the gas toward cq tau is probably richer in cn and hcn with respect to co , taking into account the large optical depth of the co emission toward mwc 480 @xcite , as might be expected for a smaller disk , completely exposed to uv radiation .",
    "the upper limits on the [ dco@xmath4]/[hco@xmath4 ] abundance ratio of @xmath160.070.32 found toward the t tauri systems in discs are consistent with the ratio of 0.0350.05 observed toward tw hydrae @xcite . the better constrained [ dcn]/[hcn ] ratio of 0.06 toward lkca 15 is also consistent with the value of 0.020.05 toward tw hydrae .",
    "while this ratio may be overestimated by a factor of a few , high levels of deuterium fractionation seems common toward t tauri systems .    as found in single dish studies ,",
    "the cn / hcn line intensity ratios toward the taurus disks are high compared to interstellar clouds and cores",
    ". the line ratios all fall within the range of measurements toward other disks , where the total integrated flux ratio of cn / hcn is @xmath015 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a compilation ) .",
    "a more quantitative comparison with previous observations is difficult without detailed modeling because different studies observed different transitions of cn and hcn .      in agreement with previous studies ,",
    "we find that the disks surrounding t tauri stars are more chemically rich in species with strong mm - transitions compared to disks around herbig ae stars @xcite .",
    "the observed chemical poverty in the outer disks of herbig ae stars has been attributed to the more intense uv field around herbig ae stars compared to t tauri stars , which may efficiently photodissociate most targeted molecules . in this sample ,",
    "the most obvious difference between t tauri and herbig ae stars is the lack of the cold chemistry tracers n@xmath7h@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 , dcn and h@xmath7co toward cq tau and mwc 480 , while they are detected in 3/4 , 2/4 , 1/4 and 3/4 of the t tauri systems .",
    "the upper limits toward cq tau are less informative because of its weak co emission and observations toward more herbig ae stars are required to confirm that this difference between disks around low and medium mass stars is general .    in contrast the",
    "cn and hcn emission is similar toward the lowest and highest luminosity stars , dm tau and mwc 480 , in the sample .",
    "cn and hcn emission are modeled to originate mainly from the outer layers of the disk @xcite and this chemistry thus seems equally active toward low- and intermediate - mass pre - main sequence stars .",
    "cn is a photodissociation product of hcn and the cn / hcn ratio has been put forward to trace several different aspects of the uv field . the cn / hcn ratio is proposed to increase with the strength of the uv field @xcite , and it will be further enhanced if the uv radiation is dominated by line emission from accretion , since hcn is dissociated by ly-@xmath17 photons while cn is not @xcite .",
    "dust settling or coagulation allows radiation to penetrate deeper into the disk , which is also predicted to enhance the cn / hcn ratio @xcite .",
    "the quiescent uv luminosity increases with stellar mass .",
    "there is however no visible trend in the emission ratio of cn / hcn with spectral type .",
    "in fact , all cn / hcn ratios are the same within a factor of two , except toward aa tau , which has a factor of a few higher intensity ratio .",
    "this suggests that the cn / hcn ratio is not set by the stellar luminosity though there are complications in comparing cn / hcn ratios toward disks around low- and intermediate - mass stars because of potentially different excitation conditions for hcn in the two sets of disks @xcite . within this sample",
    "the cn / hcn ratio also does not trace accretion luminosity ; aa tau has a comparable accretion rate to lkca 15 and among the sources with comparable cn / hcn ratios the accretion rate varies by an order of magnitude .",
    "aa tau is reported to have a lower power - law index of the opacity spectrum , @xmath21 , compared to the other disks , indicative of dust growth and it may be the dust properties rather than the stellar or accretion luminosities govern the importance of photochemistry in disks . a larger sample that spans a wider range of accretion rates and dust properties is clearly required to give a more definitive answer .",
    "an additional complication is that the high cn / hcn ratio toward aa tau may be a geometric effect .",
    "compared to the other disks , aa tau is almost edge - on @xcite , which may result in preferential probing of the disk atmosphere compared to less inclined disks .",
    "disk chemistry models ( fogel et al . submitted to apj ) show that cn mainly emits from the disk surface , while hcn emission originates further into the molecular disk layer and the more inclined disk may offer a viewing angle that is biased toward cn emission . to estimate the effect of disk inclination on",
    "cn / hcn flux variations then requires a combination of chemical modeling and radiative transfer models .    in terms of absolute flux intensities , the weak cn and hcn emission toward gm aur compared to lkca 15 and dm tau stands out .",
    "the difference between gm aur and lkca 15 may be due to the higher accretion rate and intenser fuv field toward lkca 15 .",
    "the difference between dm tau and gm aur is however difficult to explain in terms of uv flux , since dm tau is a weaker accretor than gm aur .",
    "there is some evidence for significantly more dust settling toward lkca 15 and dm tau compared to gm aur @xcite .",
    "this may expose more of the gas in the lkca 15 and dm tau disks to high - energy radiation , enhancing the photoproduction of cn and hcn as well as the ion chemistry deeper in toward the disk midplane .",
    "lower abundances of dco@xmath4 , dcn , n@xmath7h@xmath4 and h@xmath7co toward more luminous stars are qualitatively consistent with our current chemical understanding .",
    "dco@xmath4 forms efficiently from gas phase reactions with h@xmath7d@xmath4 , which is only enhanced at low temperatures @xcite and should be enhanced toward colder disks . among the t tauri",
    "stars the brightest dco@xmath4 emission is observed toward the disk around the least luminous star , dm tau , consistent with a higher degree of deuterium fractionation around colder stars .",
    "the difference in dco@xmath4 line flux around gm aur and lkca 15 is more difficult to explain .",
    "gm aur has a more massive dust disk than lkca 15 and the two stars have similar luminosities .",
    "naively gm aur should then be surrounded by at least as much cold disk material as lkca 15 .",
    "instead , the upper limit on the dco@xmath4 flux is a factor of three lower toward gm aur compared to lkca 15 .",
    "there is thus no one - to - one correlation between the ratio of disk dust mass over quiescent stellar luminosity and dco@xmath4 column densities .",
    "n@xmath7h@xmath4 forms from protonation of n@xmath7 by h@xmath47 and is mainly destroyed by reactions with co @xcite .",
    "abundant n@xmath7h@xmath4 is therefore only expected where co is depleted onto grains toward the disk midplane .",
    "n@xmath7 freezes onto grains a few degrees below co @xcite and in cold disks the n@xmath7h@xmath4 abundance should peak in a narrow region where the temperature is between the n@xmath7 sublimation temperature of @xmath016  k and the co sublimation temperature of @xmath019  k. as long as a cold region exists in the disk , the n@xmath7h@xmath4 abundances may be quite independent of the total amount of cold disk material .",
    "the observations are consistent with this disk abundance structure ; within the t tauri sample the n@xmath7h@xmath4 emission only varies by a factor of two , increasing slightly with increasing disk mass .",
    "the variation in dco@xmath4/n@xmath7h@xmath4 flux ratios over the sample suggest that while both molecules trace a cold chemistry , their dependences on the physical environment is considerably different .",
    "the @xmath418 times higher dco@xmath4/n@xmath7h@xmath4 flux ratios toward dm tau and lkca 15 compared to gm aur may be related to the 56 times higher fluxes of cn and hcn toward dm tau and lkca 15 compared to gm aur .",
    "this would suggest that both ratios depend on the amount of dust settling and that dco@xmath4 trace a cold radiation driven chemistry .",
    "considering the ions involved in forming dco@xmath4 and dcn , it seems reasonable that their formation will be enhanced in regions that are irradiated , but not heated by fuv photons or x - rays . to test this hypothesis",
    "requires h@xmath24co@xmath4 abundances toward both systems ( to measure whether the dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 abundance ratio varies as well ) in combination with a model that simultaneously treat deuterium chemistry and uv and x - ray radiative transfer .",
    "h@xmath7co can form both through gas and grain surface processes .",
    "the gas phase process starts with ch@xmath47 reacting with h@xmath7 @xcite and is expected to be at least as efficient in disks around low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "in contrast , h@xmath7co formation on grains requires the freeze - out of co , which is only efficient at low temperatures .",
    "the absence of h@xmath7co toward the more luminous stars suggests that the grain surface formation mechanism dominates in disks and it is also another indication of the lack of a large cold chemistry reservoir toward disks around intermediate mass stars .",
    "it also suggests that the organic molecules formed in the protostellar stage , where h@xmath7co is common , do not survive in the gas phase in mature disks .    in summary ,",
    "all potential tracers of cold chemistry imply the same lack of cold disk material around herbig ae stars , which is in agreement with a recent survey of co gas toward herbig ae / be stars @xcite . in contrast , @xcite find that the disk around the herbig ae star mwc 480 contains large amounts of cold co gas , below 17  k , indicative of cold material outside of 200 au .",
    "at these temperatures co should not be in the gas phase at all , however , since it is below the sublimation point of co ice .",
    "its presence is a sign of either efficient mixing in the disk or efficient non - thermal ice evaporation , perhaps through photodesorption @xcite .",
    "mixing may drag up material from the midplane on shorter timescales than the cold chemistry timescales , explaining the lack of cold chemistry tracers .",
    "efficient photodesorption of co into the gas phase would also explain the lack of n@xmath7h@xmath4 and h@xmath7co , while its impact on the deuterium fractionation is harder to assess .",
    "the same processes are probably present in disks around t tauri stars as well , but because their disks are overall colder there is still enough material protected from vertical mixing and photodesorption on long enough timescales for large amounts of n@xmath7h@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 and h@xmath7co to form .",
    "the lack of ch@xmath10oh detections does not put strong constraints on the ch@xmath10oh / h@xmath7co abundance ratio , since h@xmath7co is barely detected and the ch@xmath10oh transitions in this spectral region are more than an order of magnitude weaker than the observed h@xmath7co transitions . to put stronger constraints on ch@xmath10oh abundances in disks instead",
    "requires targeted observations of the most intense ch@xmath10oh lines .",
    "protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich chemistry that varies significantly between different objects within the same star forming region .",
    "some of this variation can be understood in terms of the central star and its heating of the disk  the cold chemistry tracers n@xmath7h@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 , dcn and h@xmath7co are only detected toward t tauri stars in our disk sample of four t tauri stars and two herbig ae stars .",
    "tracers of photochemistry , especially cn and hcn , show no clear dependence on quiescent stellar luminosity within the sample .",
    "deuterium fractionation also seems to depend on parameters other than the disk temperature structure . for these chemical systems",
    ", the impact of other sources of irradiation , e.g. accretion shocks and x - rays , as well as the disk structure and grain characteristics may all be more important for the chemical evolution than the quiescent stellar luminosity .",
    "investigating the relative importance of these different disk and star characteristics requires a combination of detailed modeling of the current sample , an increase in the number of sources to boost the statistics and span more parameters  especially a larger range of accretion rates and disks around the intermediate f stars  and targeted observations of rare isotopes of co and hco@xmath4 to extract accurate abundance ratios .",
    "while the chemical evolution in protoplanetary disks is clearly complex , the qualitative agreement between at least parts of the early discs results and our current chemical understanding is promising for the ongoing modeling of these objects .",
    "the key results so far are listed below .    1 .",
    "six disks in taurus ( dm tau , aa tau , lkca 15 , gm aur , cq tau and mwc 480 ) have been surveyed for 10 molecules , co , hco@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 , cn , hcn , dcn , h@xmath7co , n@xmath7h@xmath4 , ch@xmath10oh and c - c@xmath10h@xmath7 , with a high detection rate and large chemical variability .",
    "the brightest molecular lines , co 2 - 1 , hco@xmath4 3 - 2 , cn 3 - 2 and hcn 3 - 2 are detected toward all disks , except for hcn toward cq tau .",
    "other molecular lines tracing different types of cold chemistry , n@xmath7h@xmath4 , dco@xmath4 , dcn and h@xmath7co , are only detected toward disks around t tauri stars , indicative of a lack of cold regions around herbig ae stars for long enough time scales .",
    "3 .   both the absolute cn flux and the cn / hcn ratio vary significantly among the observed disks and their variation seems independent of stellar luminosity , suggestive of that other parameters such as accretion luminosity and dust growth and dust settling play an important role for the chemical evolution in disks .",
    "4 .   among the cold chemistry tracers",
    "the dco@xmath4/n@xmath7h@xmath4 ratio varies by an order of magnitude suggesting that the deuterium fractionation depends on other parameters , including the radiation field , beyond the amount of cold material present in the disk .",
