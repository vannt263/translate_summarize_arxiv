    "for some time now it has been standard practice in @xmath1 reactions to compare event - shape distributions with resummed perturbative predictions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the resummation is necessary because in the two - jet limit ( small values of the shape variable ) the presence of large soft and collinear logarithms spoils the convergence of the fixed - order calculations .",
    "such resummed analyses have led to valuable information about the strong coupling constant and also about non - perturbative effects .    at hera ,",
    "studies of event - shape distributions are being carried out by both collaborations @xcite but as yet no perturbative resummed calculations exist for comparison . here",
    "we present preliminary results on such a calculation @xcite .    in dis ,",
    "event shapes are defined in the current hemisphere of the breit frame @xcite to reduce contamination from remnant fragmentation which is beyond perturbative control .",
    "the distribution of emissions in the current hemisphere ( @xmath2 ) is analogous to that in a single hemisphere of @xmath1 .",
    "differences arise from @xmath3 however because the momentum of the current quark ( the quark struck by the photon ) depends on remnant - hemisphere ( @xmath4 ) emissions through recoil effects .",
    "this necessitates a resummed treatment of the space - like branching of the incoming parton .",
    "currently such a simultaneous resummation of the space - like and time - like ( double logarithmic ) contributions exists only for jet multiplicities @xcite , or for cross sections at large @xmath5 @xcite .    for the thrust @xmath6 ( as defined in the following section ) the recoil from remnant hemisphere emissions can be divided into two parts : a piece from soft and collinear emissions , which gives double logarithms @xmath7 , identical to those from half a hemisphere of @xmath3 , and a piece from purely collinear emissions which gives single logarithms @xmath8 that can be identified with a change of scale in the parton distribution .",
    "this is outlined in the next section .",
    "a valuable cross - check of any resummation is to expand it to nlo and compare the result to that from fixed order monte carlo programs such as disaster++ @xcite and disent @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in section  [ sec : fixed ] .    finally in section  [ sec : future ] , we comment on possible future developments .",
    "there are several possible definitions of the thrust in dis , which differ according to a choice of axis and the normalisation .",
    "we here consider the thrust with respect to the photon axis , @xmath9 , and normalised to @xmath10 , @xmath11 where the sum extends over all particles in the current hemisphere , @xmath12 . at lowest order @xmath13 , so the region requiring resummation will be that of @xmath14 close to zero .    expressing all momenta in terms of their sudakov components @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are along the remnant and current directions respectively ,",
    "we can write the thrust as @xcite @xmath18 where the sums now run over emitted particles only and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 component of the current quark . ] .",
    "dependence on the remnant hemisphere emissions arises both through the @xmath21 term and through @xmath22 ( we have made use of the fact that @xmath23 ) .",
    "we now consider the cross section @xmath24 for @xmath14 to be smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "roughly it will contain virtual corrections from the exclusion of all emissions whose contribution to is larger than @xmath25 .    in the remnant hemisphere",
    "we exclude soft and collinear emissions , @xmath26 , where the @xmath27 condition ensures that particle be in @xmath4 .",
    "the integration over @xmath28 and @xmath29 gives a double logarithm .",
    "in @xmath2 we exclude the soft and collinear region @xmath30 .",
    "again this gives us a double logarithm .",
    "the exclusion @xmath31 is just a limit on the maximum emitted transverse momentum : this implies ` stopping ' the dglap @xcite parton evolution at a scale @xmath32 , which gives single collinear logarithms .",
    "these aspects are illustrated in the first order result for @xmath24 : @xmath33    \\\\ -        \\frac{\\as}{2\\pi }   \\frac{\\ln 1/\\tau}{q(x ) }        \\int_x^1   \\frac{d z}{z }    \\left[q\\left(\\frac{x}{z}\\right ) p_{qq } ( z ) +   g\\left(\\frac{x}{z}\\right ) p_{qg } ( z )    \\right ] .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the first line contains the soft and collinear double logarithms ( which turn out to be identical to the @xmath3 result ) from the conditions on the @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the second line contains the collinear logarithm associated with the restriction on the dglap evolution .",
    "photon - gluon fusion plays a role only through this collinear logarithm , in the convolution with the gluon distribution .",
    "the actual details of the resummation will be presented in @xcite .",
    "schematically , the result is @xmath36 \\frac{q(x,\\tau q^2)}{q(x , q^2 ) } \\ ,    \\sigma(\\tau),\\qquad \\sigma(\\tau ) =   e^ { - \\frac{\\as \\cf}{2 \\pi }   \\left[2 \\ln^2 \\frac1\\tau -          3 \\ln \\frac1\\tau \\right ] + \\co{\\as^2\\ln^3\\frac1\\tau}},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is just the corresponding @xmath3 quantity of @xcite and @xmath38 is a @xmath25-independent coefficient function which is given in @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 comes from the suppression of radiation with @xmath40 , as mentioned above .",
    "expanding to nlo it is possible to perform a comparison to the fixed order monte carlo programs disaster++ @xcite and disent @xcite .",
    "we actually look at the coefficient of @xmath41 in @xmath42 where we have normalised to the the born cross section @xmath43 for simplicity . at second order eq .   contains terms @xmath44 , @xmath45 and for the resummation to be correct to next - to - leading order we should correctly control terms @xmath46 .",
    "so the difference between our expanded result and the exact result should at most be a constant for small @xmath25 .",
    "the upper two plots of figure  [ fig : disdis ] show our results for the quark and gluon - initiated components of the answer compared to the predictions from disaster++ .",
    "the shape of the distributions is well reproduced for small @xmath25 .",
    "the lower two plots show the difference between the disaster++ results and ours : one sees that for small @xmath25 this difference is indeed compatible with a constant , as required .",
    "comparisons have also been made with disent , which seems to disagree with our result in the gluon sector at the level of a term proportional to @xmath47 , and perhaps also in the quark sector .",
    "although we have results for the resummation of the thrust distribution in dis , some work remains to be done for the practical implementation of our results for comparison with experimental data .",
    "in particular , prescriptions need to be defined for the matching of our resummed result with the fixed order results , in order extend the range of applicability of the calculation ( without the matching the results are applicable only to very small @xmath25 ) .",
    "work is also in progress on the resummation of other dis event - shape variables . among these ,",
    "the thrust normalised to the energy in the current hemisphere is close to completion .",
    "other variables to be studied include the jet mass , the @xmath48-parameter and the jet - broadening ( the resummation of the latter is relevant also for predicting the form of the power correction @xcite ) .",
    "once this programme is complete , we hope that it will lead to phenomenological studies analogous to those already being carried out in @xmath3 .",
    "we benefited much from continuous discussions of this and related subjects with yuri dokshitzer , pino marchesini and mike seymour .",
