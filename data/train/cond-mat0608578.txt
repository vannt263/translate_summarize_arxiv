    "front propagation is an important field of study in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "we often encounter these propagating fronts separating different phases in physics , chemistry and biology @xcite . here , in this work , we study the dynamics of the front in the reaction - diffusion system @xmath7 , @xmath8 in one dimensional lattice . at the macroscopic level , the mean field theory yields the following partial differential equation for the coarse grained concentration @xmath9 , @xmath10 where , @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient of the particle and @xmath11 and @xmath2 are the rates of single ( @xmath7 ) and twin ( @xmath8 ) offspring production respectively . equation ( [ e1 ] ) reduces to the well known fisher equation @xcite when @xmath12 , which models the reaction diffusion equation @xmath7 .",
    "the microscopic lattice model for @xmath7 has been studied extensively @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the mean field allows travelling wave solution of the form @xmath13 , where the velocity of an initially sharp front between @xmath14 ( stable ) and @xmath15 ( unstable ) state approaches an asymptotic velocity @xmath16 .",
    "we consider a @xmath1 lattice composed of sites @xmath17 .",
    "we start with the step function like distribution where , the left half is filled with @xmath5 particles while the right half is empty .",
    "each site @xmath18 can either be empty or occupied by maximum one particle i.e. hard core exclusion is enforced .",
    "we update the system random sequentially where @xmath19 microscopic moves correspond to one monte carlo step ( mcs ) . during each updating",
    "we randomly select a site and the particle at the site can undergo one of the following three microscopic moves . + ( 1 ) the particle can jump to neighbouring empty site with rate @xmath4 , + ( 2 ) the particle can give birth of one particle at either of the empty neighbouring sites with rate @xmath11 , + ( 3 ) the particle can generate two new particles at both the neighbouring sites provided both are empty with rate @xmath2 . + these processes are shown in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : moves_1d ] ) . + as time evolves , these stochastic moves result in the stochastic movement of the front . as has been argued in @xcite , the front may be identified with the rightmost @xmath5 particle . in this paper , we are interested in the dynamics of front whose evolution may be described by the following master equation@xcite .",
    "@xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the probability distribution of finding the front particle at position @xmath22 at a time @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the joint probability that the front is at @xmath22 at time @xmath23 _ and _ the site just behind it is empty . in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , the first term corresponds to the forward hopping of the front particle from the position @xmath25 to reach @xmath22 due to birth of a single particle or diffusion .",
    "the second term corresponds to twin production at left and right neighbouring sites of site @xmath25 and which results in the front moving from @xmath25 to @xmath22 .",
    "the third term corresponds to the backward hopping of the front particle from position @xmath26 due to diffusion , provided site @xmath22 is empty .",
    "last two terms account for the possible jumps of the front particle from position @xmath22 , which leads to front moving either at @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the dynamical properties of the front that we want to study are its velocity @xmath27 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath28 which are defined as : @xmath29 @xmath30 where , @xmath31 .",
    "now we use the eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) and normalization @xmath32 and taking @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the probability that site @xmath25 is occupied . denoting @xmath35 , we obtain the following expression for the asymptotic velocity and diffusion coefficient of the front .",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 in order to obtain the velocity and diffusion coefficient we need to know @xmath38 , which is the density of site just behind the front . in @xcite",
    "for @xmath12 , it was shown that front velocity approaches asymptotically the mean field value @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 , while @xmath41 in the opposite limit @xmath42 .",
    "but , when we are in between these two extreme limits we need to know @xmath38 and we expect similar features when @xmath43 .",
    "there is no method to find this value exactly .",
    "here we present some approximate analytic estimates for @xmath38 and hence the front velocity . in subsection a , we use fixed site representation method , where a truncated master equation is written in the frame moving with the front , as discussed in @xcite . in subsection",
    "b , we apply two particle representation scheme proposed by kerstein @xcite while in c a mixed scheme is proposed which yields better results than either a or b.      this method has been proposed in @xcite for the reaction diffusion process @xmath44 . here ,",
    "we write a truncated master equation in the frame moving with the front .",
    "the simplest set of states is:@xmath45 , which corresponds to the evolution of occupancy at a site just behind the front particle(@xmath46 ) . here",
    "the rightmost @xmath47 in each state corresponds to the front particle .",
    "these two states make transitions between each other due to the microscopic processes in the system as shown in fig .",

    "( c ) @xmath49 changes to @xmath48 due to creation of twins at both neighbouring sites of the front with rate @xmath2 .",
    "( d ) @xmath50 , if the front takes diffusive move to its left and the second site behind the front is occupied .",
    "this occurs with rate @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the probability of occupancy at the second site behind the front.,width=240,height=144 ]    considering all such transitions the evolution of probabilities of these two states are given by : @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the density at the @xmath18th site behind the front and we have neglected the spatial density correlation between consecutive pairs of sites beyond the second site behind the front .",

    "( [ fig : velocity ] ) . here , we notice that for larger values of @xmath2 the simulation results show nice agreement with that of analytic results .",

    "the estimate for the velocity can be further improved if we include states with larger number of sites . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : velocity ] ) we notice two interesting points : firstly , for @xmath64 , the theoretical result matches strikingly with the simulation result , secondly , we observe a power law dependence of the velocity on @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , the first point , can be shown to be exact by noting that when @xmath64 , the front velocity from eq.([e7 ] ) is @xmath65 , which is independent of @xmath38 .      in the following ,",
    "we try to find the analytic estimates for @xmath38 using kerstein s two particles representation@xcite . in this representation",
    "each state of the system is defined by two rightmost particles and thus we have an infinite set of states : @xmath66 . here",
    ", the rightmost 1 represents the front particle while the leftmost 1 is the second particle behind it and 0 stands for empty site .",
    "let us denote by @xmath67 the probability of two particle state with @xmath68 empty sites between the leading particle and next particle behind it .",

    "since we are dealing with a multiparticle interacting system it is always desirable to include as many particles as possible while studying the evolution of the system .",
    "the simplest extension to the two particle representation is to study the evolution of the following set of states : @xmath90 , where the rightmost @xmath47 in each state denotes the front particle .",

    "thus , @xmath6 is a special case , where the front particle moves like an uncorrelated random walker .    in the following ,",
    "we explicitly show that for the special case @xmath6 , two consecutive steps of the leading particle are uncorrelated , i.e. , @xmath133 in the steady state . since at most two sites behind the front can be affected in two consecutive steps , we consider 4 states corresponding to @xmath61 , namely , @xmath134 with the rightmost @xmath135 representing the front . in order to find @xmath136 , we write @xmath137 , where @xmath138 denotes the flux @xmath139 for taking two consecutive steps as @xmath140 and @xmath141 . here",

    "however , when @xmath6 , we find that @xmath153 is independent of all the probabilities and is equal to zero , i. e. , two successive steps are uncorrelated as observed in the simulation result ( fig.[fig : vel_corr ] ) .",
    "we also note that for this special case the above analysis does not involve any approximation i.e. it is exact .",
    "we also notice that when @xmath154 , @xmath155 , i.e. , the front motion is correlated .",

    "in the present paper , we studied the reaction diffusion system @xmath157 in one dimension . treating the rightmost occupied site as a front we compute the front velocity analytically using different approximate methods .",
    "in fixed site representation one can systematically improve upon the estimate by studying the evolution of particles at larger number of sites behind the front .",
    "the results from two particle representation and mixed representation show excellent agreement with the simulation results .",
    "we also observed that the velocity depends on @xmath2 as a power law .",
    "as far as the computation of front diffusion coefficient is concerned , we notice that one needs to take into account the temporal velocity correlation .",

    "the temporal correlations in steps vanish and the front particle moves like a simple uncorrelated random walker .",
    "an interesting generalization of the process would be to include the annihilation of particles as well i.e. , @xmath158 with rate @xmath159 . the case @xmath12 and @xmath160 is exactly solvable @xcite and both temporal and spatial correlations vanish . for non - zero @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath159",
    ", simulations show that temporal correlations vanish on the plane @xmath161 , although spatial correlations do not .",
