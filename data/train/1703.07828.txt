    "heavy quarks ( hqs ) represent an ideal probe for investiganting the properties of hot and dense qcd matter created at ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ( urhics ) .",
    "they are created at early stages of collisions and due to their large masses they have a large thermalization time with respect to the bulk medium . thus they conserve memory of propagation during the entire space - time evolution of the qgp .",
    "as they diffuse through the medium , hqs suffer collisions and radiative effects as a kind of gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "both processes are responsible for the substantial quenching of high-@xmath3 hqs and also for the coupling of their dynamics with the bulk collective flow .",
    "the two key observables in hq sector are the nuclear suppression factor @xmath4 , i.e. the ratio between the spectra of heavy flavor hadrons and their decay products measured in nucleus - nucleus collisions with the same spectra in proton - proton ones , and the elliptic flow @xmath5 which is a measure of the developed anisotropies in the angular distributions in momentum space .",
    "both observables have been measured at rhic and lhc facilities @xcite @xcite and the challenge of each theoretical framework is to give a consistent explanation of the surprising low @xmath1 and high @xmath2 observed in the hq sector , hence solving the so called @xmath6 .",
    "we describe the hq propagation inside the qgp by means of relativistic boltzmann equation which is written as follows : @xmath7(x , p)\\ ] ] @xmath8 is the hq phase - space distribution function and @xmath9 $ ] is the relativistic boltzmann - like collision integral which contains all the interaction mechanisms between hqs and light partons of the bulk , which for simplicity we assume to be formed by gluons .",
    "we consider only elastic two - body collisions whose total cross section is derived from the scattering matrices of @xmath10 processes calculated at pqcd leading - order @xcite .",
    "a realistic debye screening mass @xmath11 for regulating the _ t_-channel gluon propagator and the pqcd running of the coupling constant @xmath12 with bulk temperature _ t _ are also included .",
    "the integrated distribution function for the medium components contained in @xmath9 $ ] is determined in analogous manner by solving the related boltzmann - vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation is solved numerically dividing the coordinate space in a 3d lattice and the test particle method is used to sample the distribution function in each cell .",
    "the collision integral is solved by means of the stochastic algorithm for evaluating the collision probability @xcite @xcite .",
    "+ the goal of this work is to include inside this framework a model which could account for the energy loss of hqs by inelastic processes . with this aim",
    "we implemented a mechanism for medium - induced gluon radiation calculated in multiple - scattering approximation and pqcd factorization scheme which was already included in other models where hq dynamics was described by langevin @xcite or linearized boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the differential spectrum of emitted gluons is derived from the higher - twist calculation for the energy loss of fast partons @xcite @xcite and heavy quarks @xcite and it is given by the following expression    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the fraction of hq energy @xmath16 carried away by the emitted gluon and the transverse gluon momentum with respect to the propagating direction .",
    "+ @xmath17 is the gluon splitting function derived from medium - modified dglap equations @xcite , while the @xmath18 represents the hq transport coefficient depending on _ e _ and _ t_. in this initial work we simply relate the @xmath18 with the momentum - space diffusion coefficient , i.e. @xmath19 , which has a better significance if fokker - planck approach for hq dynamics is applied . in further",
    "study a more precise treatment of @xmath18 within our boltzmann transport model will be considered referring also to the jet collaboration efforts done in extracting such jet quenching parameter @xcite .",
    "destructive interference known as lpm effect @xcite which occurs if the time between two successive collisions is smaller than the formation time @xmath20 and suppression of radiation at small angle of emission (  dead - cone  effect @xcite ) due to non - negligible hq mass @xmath21 are both included as visible from eq .  .",
    "+ the differential spectrum is numerically integrated in @xmath14 and @xmath22 and the result multiplied by the timestep of evolution @xmath23 in order to get the single - emission radiation probability @xmath24 . a physical lower cut - off of the gluon energy equivalent to @xmath25 is considered in order to avoid the divergence at @xmath26 . in the same manner we did for the collision probability , we use @xmath24 to sample the number of test particles which radiate at each timestep and we distribute the four - momentum components of the emitted gluon according to the differential spectrum eq .  . by such a fully reconstruction of the final state",
    "we are able to relax the path - length approximation for hq propagation and include its diffusion during the radiation mechanism , which we predict has a remarkable effect on @xmath2 formation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : v2_rhic_fixed ] ) since it couples the hq dynamics at high @xmath3 more strongly to the collective flow of the bulk , keeping a similar suppression pattern .",
    "we have carried out simulations at rhic ( au+au at @xmath27 agev , @xmath28 fm ) events .",
    "the initial conditions in the coordinate space are given by the standard geometrical glauber model , while for initial distributions in momentum space we employ a boltzmann - jttner function for bulk gluons and a power law function calculated within pqcd nlo @xcite for charm quarks .",
    "+ our purpose in this study was to investigate the impact of various energy loss scenarios on @xmath1 and @xmath2 observables , therefore we have not included the hadronization mechanisms yet . + it is well know that pqcd alone is not able to reproduce the quenching in hq sector .",
    "the problem is usually cleared by introducing a constant _ k _ factor to enhance cross section for hq scatterings .",
    "the physical reason for introducing such factor is the idea to include non - perturbative effects inside the hq dynamics which become dominant at low @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however in the region of high @xmath3 where radiative energy loss is much higher than collisional one , such non - perturbative effects should be negligible . referring to @xcite we model this effect by multiplying both collisional and radiative probabilities with a @xmath3-dependent _ k_-enhancement which for simplicity",
    "is assumed to have a gaussian profile : @xmath29.$ ] we set the width parameter @xmath30 in order to reach the condition @xmath31 at @xmath0 gev with a good approximation .",
    "the amplitude @xmath32 which corresponds to the maximum enhancement in the limit @xmath33 is fixed instead by fitting the @xmath1 with a non - physical scenario where only collisions occur . the @xmath1 suppression in all studied scenarios is shown in fig .  [ fig : raa_rhic1 ] .",

    "[ fig : v2_rhic_fixed ] .",
    "the production of @xmath2 at @xmath0 gev is mostly determined by the radiative mechanism .",
    "as said before , we notice that in our approach the formation of @xmath2 is naturally beyond the simple path - length approximation ; in fact the hqs can both radiate or absorb energy and can deviate from their trajectory due to gluon emission .",

    "in this work we studied the hq propagation in qgp by means of boltzmann equation and we implemented both a radiative and collisional energy loss mechanism . for the low @xmath3 region we modelled non - perturbative effects using a @xmath35 enhancement which disappears once the momentum scale is sufficiently higher to have a perturbative regime ( @xmath36 gev ) . in future , we will concentrate on the possibility of implementing a multiple - emission algorithm in order to increase the role of coherent effects during radiative processes and also include the emitted gluons within the bulk dynamics and the subsequent rescattering .",
    "we will focus also on accounting non - perturbative effects with a different _ t_-dependent behaviour of the interaction strenght in order to study the @xmath2 formation at low @xmath3 .",
    "the goal is to include the hq transport model in a more complete description of urhics where also initial - stage dynamics and hadronization mechanisms are accounted .",
    "the aim is not only to solve the @xmath6 puzzle but also to investigate more differential observables , such as azimuthal correlations , which are going to be measured both at rhic and lhc energies hopefully ."
