    "the esa planck surveyor will produce ten all - sky high - resolution maps of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies at 9 frequencies , from which the angular power spectrum will be derived to place constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the maps produced by the planck satellite , however , will not only include the cmb signal but also contain some astrophysical foreground sources arising from dust , free ",
    "free , synchrotron emission , sunyaev - zeldovich effects and extragalactic point sources .",
    "it is therefore an important task to separate those foreground sources from the cmb signal . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the bright point sources with flux above @xmath0 jy in connection with the early release compact source catalogue ( ercsc ) from the planck mission .",
    "the main goal of the ercsc construction is to produce such a catalogue right after the first six months of observation of the cmb sky by the planck before more complicated and time consuming analysis of the cmb power spectrum , component separation and investigation of in - flight systematics .",
    "therefore , it would be very useful to develop a fast method of the point sources extraction which needs as little information as possible about the parameters of the experiment .    in this paper , we present a fast linear algorithm for the extraction of extragalactic point sources from the cmb maps , which is a generalized amplitude - phase method of naselsky , novikov & silk ( 2002 ) .",
    "there have been developments of methods on point source extraction such as the high - pass filter by tegmark  and  de  oliveira - costa  ( 1998 ) ( hereafter to98 ) , maximum  entropy method ( mem ) by hobson  et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and mexican hat wavelet method ( mhw ) by cayn  et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) . here",
    "we introduce a simple top - hat filter for the extraction of point sources in the cmb maps .",
    "this method works very well without assumptions about the cosmological model , or _ a priori _ knowledge of the power spectrum of cmb and point sources .",
    "the filter proposed by td98 is _ optimal _ for point source extraction from the theoretical point of view , and requires the exact information about the cmb and the foregrounds power spectrum , the beam shape properties ( its ellipticity and orientation ) , and the pixel noise level . for concrete applications ,",
    "however , other methods can also be useful , which explains the succeeding discussions of other filters in the literature mentioned above and in this paper .",
    "we will compare our filter with the td98 filter .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the top  hat filter and elaborate the subtlety in the definition of the criterion by which the point sources are extracted . as our top ",
    "hat filtering range is adaptive , we apply in section 3 the top ",
    "hat filter to the numerical simulated maps and estimate the filtering ranges for the planck channels when the experiment parameters such as the beam size and the pixel noise level are known .",
    "we also compare our method with the theoretically optimal td98 filter in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we generalize our filter to an algorithm that does not need any information about the cmb power spectrum , the beam size and the noise level .",
    "the results and discussion are in section 6 .",
    "in the observed map by the planck satellite the signal at pixel @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pixel noise , @xmath4 correspoinds to the position of the @xmath1-pixel in the map and @xmath5 includes the cmb signal and foreground contaminations , of which the relevant component to this paper is the point source contribution .",
    "expanding @xmath6 in spherical harmonics , we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the beam response .",
    "the main idea of our method to extract point sources is through a simple linear top ",
    "hat filter in the harmonic domain with two cut  off scales .",
    "these two scales serve to remove the influence of the lower and higher multipole parts of the total power spectrum of the signal for optimal extraction of point sources from the planck maps .",
    "in td98 the authors introduced the ratio of the amplitude of a point source ( convolved with the beam ) to the variance of the total signal in the map @xmath9 , which can be denoted as @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the contribution from the point source relative flux @xmath12 to the map , @xmath13 denotes convolution , and @xmath14 is the beam response , which is assumed gaussian .",
    "they found the shape of the filter @xmath15 by maximizing @xmath16 .    in our method",
    "we introduce a linear filter , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the heaviside step function , i.e. , @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the filtering range of @xmath24 .",
    "this filter has a top  hat shape in the harmonic domain with two characteristic scales @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath26 , both of which are functions of the antenna beam shape , the power spectrum of the cmb , the power spectra of all kinds of foregrounds and pixel noise , and possible systematic features .",
    "when these parameters are known , we can find @xmath25 and @xmath26 through maximizing @xmath27 for each frequency channel of the planck mission and @xmath26 can be used as the first step of the iteration scheme introduced in section  [ iteration ] to maximize the @xmath28 factor when the parameters have considerable variations against predicted values . ] . here",
    "@xmath29 is the filter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heaviside ] ) in the real domain and @xmath28 is the resultant relative flux , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is defined by @xmath33 being the amplitude of the deepest minimum in the map , with @xmath34 the square root of the variance of the pre - filtered map .",
    "note that there is a subtle difference between the td98 filtering and the top - hat optimization algorithm in the definition of the criterion by which the point sources are extracted .",
    "in order to obtain the filter shape , the td98 filter is defined by maximizing the @xmath35 ratio in their theoretical derivation whereas the top  hat filter is defined by maximizing the @xmath36 ratio . according to the prediction of bright point source contamination in the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) frequency range of the planck mission @xcite , point sources with flux above @xmath37 jy are rare events in a @xmath38 patch of the sky .",
    "for the 30 ghz frequency channel , for example , the estimated number density of point sources is @xmath390.3 - 1 source for each @xmath40 patch .",
    "thus each bright point source is a peculiar peak in the @xmath6 map and the observed amplitude of the point source in the map is a combination of the point source contribution itself ( which is not known ) , the signal from the cmb plus foregrounds convolved with beam response , and pixel noise contribution in the pixel containing the point source signal . as is mentioned in td98 , in order to extract point sources from the filtered map it is necessary to introduce a criterion to screen point sources from the ` noise ' .",
    "it is the so  called @xmath41 criterion , which means that the peaks in the filtered map with amplitudes above @xmath41 threshold are identified as point sources , @xmath42 being the square root of the variance of the filtered map .",
    "the amplitude of each filtered peak above @xmath41 , however , is the combination of the amplitude of the point source and the filtered ` noise ' .",
    "therefore , generally speaking , the final ( filtered ) signal around the peak area with the amplitude around @xmath41 is sensitive to the actual realization of the pre - filtered ` noise ' , which can either increase or decrease the point source amplitude depending on initial realization of the ` noise ' signal .",
    "this is the reason why the td98 filter can distinguish _ mean _ point source contribution from the map . in our method for the construction of the filter we consider the worst case , i.e. , when the point source is at the position of the deepest minimum @xmath43 of the signal in the map .",
    "4.1 cm +   +    4.1 cm +   +   +    we would like to point out the significance of the two characteristic scales @xmath25 and @xmath26 on enhancing the ratio of the point source flux to the @xmath42 of the filtered map .",
    "there are two main features on the total power spectrum @xmath44 from the map as shown in fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum1 ] and fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum2 ] . on the low multipole end , there are the cmb itself which has the standard characteristic of @xmath45 with a harrison - zeldovich power spectrum from adiabatic perturbation , together with the so  called low multipole tail from the foregrounds such as dust emission , free  free and synchrotron emission .",
    "thus the scale @xmath25 of the top ",
    "hat filter cuts off this low multipole part of the total power spectrum @xmath44 .",
    "for the high multipole end , on the other hand , the most dominant component in @xmath44 is the pixel noise .",
    "the corresponding scale @xmath26 is therefore crucial in cutting down the pixel noise contribution in the filtered map , hence decreasing @xmath42 .",
    "hat filter aims to suppress the low multipole tail and the pixel noise contribution so as to minimize the @xmath42 . at the same time",
    ", it retains the part of @xmath44 that is most modified by the beam response ( see the shaded area of each panel in both fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum1 ] and fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum2 ] ) .",
    "this means that , instead of the theoretically optimal td98 filter which needs some preliminary and detailed information about the power spectra of the planck map components and corresponding beam response , the top ",
    "hat filter has the simplest shape that transforms the uncertainties of the parameters to the scales of the cut - off @xmath23 .    in constructing the top - hat filter for a specific frequency channel",
    ", we have to estimate the two cut  off scales when the experimental parameters such as the beam size and the pixel noise level are known . to do so , we choose the deepest minimum of the ` noise ' as the position of the point source ( hence the expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deepest ] ) ) and optimize the cut - off scales @xmath23 exactly from such worst realization of the point source signal and ` noise ' . the filter with the filtering range obtained by the optimization of the signal @xmath46 ( point source ) to the ` noise ' @xmath47 ratio for the filtered map in the worst case under the condition @xmath48 allows us to detect all point sources with the same flux ( and above ) at any other different locations of the map .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to compare from the theoretical point of view the enhancement factor in details between these two filters for a single point source , we need the information of the location and amplitude of the point source .",
    "specifically when we place one point source at the deepest minimum , this situation favours the top  hat filter , as the top ",
    "hat filter is ` designed ' for this situation and similar situations such as other local minima .",
    "also the amplitude of the point source is crucial in the enhancement factor @xmath28 .",
    "though from table  [ enhancement ] for the hfi channels the @xmath28 from td98 filter is higher , it does become smaller than that from the top ",
    "hat filter when the point source amplitude is significantly smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "the determination of the top  hat filtering range for each channel is sensitive to the cmb power spectrum model , pixel noise properties , beam shape and foregrounds contamination .",
    "however , for the proposed ercsc construction it is absolutely necessary to simplify the method of the point source detection from the map , using general characteristics of the ` noise ' and point sources only .",
    "we would like to point out specifically that the point source filter with adaptive range and a fixed shape , such as the top ",
    "hat filter is a much simpler way to define such kind of filters . as the concept of the top  hat and the td98 filter to extract point sources takes advantage of the bending on the power spectrum by the beam response and the pixel noise level , they are both useful for the regions near the ecliptic plane in the flat sky approximation , where the scans are nearly parallel without crossings ( see the fig.1 of delabrouille , patanchon & audit 2002 )",
    ". for high galactic latitude scans , however , the crossings of scans complicate the beam shape configuration . the effective asymmetric beam will manifest itself in the fourier domain which is not isotropic in the fourier ring ( see the fig.1 of chiang  et  al .",
    "it is unknown whether the global beam orientation is fixed ( parallel ) in the scans of planck .",
    "if it is not , it will have degradation effect on point source extraction from any input of fixed beam function , such as the td98 filter and mhw method .    to tackle this problem and also to relax the condition we set earlier in section  [ estimation ] to determine the filtering range",
    ", we would like to expand the top ",
    "hat filter to a more generalized algorithm .",
    "following naselsky ,  novikov  &  silk  ( 2002 ) , we can apply the iteration scheme for point source extraction from the map , using as the initial step of iterations the suggested @xmath23 parameters from table  [ range ] . without acquiring the exact characteristics of the experiment such as pixel noise level and beam shape and size",
    ", the initial filtering with the suggested set of @xmath50 may not result in maximal enhancement for that specific realization .",
    "we can , however , always find the highest peak in the filtered map after the first top  hat filtering .",
    "there are two possibilities for the value of the amplitude of such peak .",
    "if we choose the criterion for the point source detection as @xmath51 , it is likely that the actual value of the amplitude for the highest peak satisfies this criterion , from which we can claim we have identified a point source that can be removed easily from the map . if the highest peak is less than @xmath41 , we can make the second iteration by slightly fine  tuning the @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameter .",
    "for the highest peak @xmath52 after the first iteration , if we still can not increase its filtered amplitude up to the criterion after fine - tuning , we can claim that it is not a point source .",
    "of course , for higher frequency channels of hfi we can set the criterion lower than @xmath41 as shown in table  [ enhancement ] , which means we can detect point sources with @xmath53 .",
    "the principal idea is that , with an adaptive filtering range , we can change @xmath54 and @xmath55 step by step to check the change of @xmath28 of the highest peak . in each iteration",
    "we need to compare the amplitude of the highest peak ( after filtering ) with the criterion for point source detection . for this algorithm ,",
    "suppose that for the 100 ghz channel of hfi we put a point source with @xmath56 at an unknown position in the map and the pixel noise level is twice the predicted value .",
    "when we apply the filter with the suggested range , we can detect the highest point , which is less than @xmath41 . by tuning the @xmath54 with fixed @xmath55 to re - filter the original map",
    ", we can always find the enhancement @xmath28 by going through a bump along @xmath54 .",
    "the position of the highest peak in the filtered map is the same as the initial iteration , but with different @xmath28 , which indicates our suggested filtering range is not optimal .",
    "then we fix the @xmath54 corresponding to the maximum @xmath28 of the bump , re - filtering along the @xmath55 axis to find the @xmath55 corresponding to the maximal @xmath28 . through this process",
    "we can always find the new @xmath55 and @xmath54 parameter which has the maximal enhancement @xmath28 .",
    "is now lower than that listed in table  [ range ] as the pixel noise is doubled . ]",
    "we have introduced a simple and fast top  hat filter for extraction of point sources in cmb maps . as the filter cut  off range is adaptive , we can estimate it with the simulated maps when the parameters of the planck channels are known .",
    "we would like to emphasise that the main shape of the antenna beam for the planck mission is close to elliptical due to optical distortions and telescope designs @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the beam , therefore , is crucial for any methods of point source extraction , which should be taken into account in order for maximal extraction of point sources .",
    "hat iteration algorithm , however , does not need this part of information and it will be even more useful if there is change of the beam shape due to the degradation effects of the mirrors during the mission .",
    "we also perform detailed comparison of the proposed top ",
    "hat algorithm with the td98 filter .",
    "the advantage of our method is that it is very simple , fast and does not require any detailed information about the real beam shape , the spectra of cmb and noise , and possible correlations in the pixel noise . in practice one can take the ready filter with the suggested range from table  [ range ] for each planck frequency channel ( if desirable ) to improve it by the simple and fast algorithm described in section  [ iteration ] .",
    "we would like to mention that the efficiency @xmath28 for the top ",
    "hat filter and the td98 filter shown in table  [ enhancement ] are practically the same .",
