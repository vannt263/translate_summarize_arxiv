    "estimates of the low frequency gravitational wave background below @xmath0 mhz @xcite have suggested that the profusion of binary stars in the galaxy will be a significant source of noise for space based gravitational wave observatories like lisa @xcite .",
    "most of these binary sources are expected to be monochromatic , evolving very little over the lifetime of the lisa mission ; they will thus be ever present in the data stream , and data analysis techniques will need to be developed to deal with them .    below @xmath0 mhz , it is expected that there will be more than one binary contributing to the gravitational wave background in a given frequency resolution bin .",
    "predictions suggest that the population of binaries will be so large as to produce a confusion limited background which will effectively limit the performance of the instrument . in this regime",
    ", it is likely that time delay interferometry techniques can be employed to characterize the background @xcite . at higher frequencies ,",
    "open bins appear and individual galactic binaries ( in principle ) become resolvable as single monochromatic lines in the fourier record ( a `` binary forest '' ) .",
    "complications arise , however , from the orbital motion of the lisa detector , which will modulate the signal from an individual source , spreading the signal over many frequency bins .",
    "a quick method for demodulating the effect of the orbital motion on continuous gravitational wave sources has recently been demonstrated @xcite .    unlike sources for ground based observatories , the gravitational waves from low frequency galactic binaries",
    "are expected to be well understood . in principle , it should be possible to use knowledge about the expected gravitational wave signals to `` subtract '' individual sources out of the lisa data stream , both at high frequencies where individual sources are resolvable and at lower frequencies where single bright sources will stand out above the rms level of the confusion background .",
    "the ability to perform binary subtraction in lisa data analysis is particularly important in the regime of the lisa floor ( from @xmath0 mhz to the lisa transfer frequency , @xmath1 mhz ) , where an overlapping population of galactic binaries will severely limit our ability to detect and study gravitational waves from other sources , such as the extreme mass ratio inspiral of compact objects into supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "as will be seen , the problem of subtracting a binary out of the data stream is intimately tied to the problem of source identification , which is complicated by the motion of the lisa detector .",
    "several authors @xcite have previously examined the angular resolution of the observatory as a function of the time dependent orientation .",
    "the binary subtraction problem has received some attention in the past@xcite , but the work was not published .",
    "this paper examines the problem of binary subtraction using a variant of the clean algorithm @xcite from electromagnetic astronomy as a model for the subtraction procedure .",
    "the clean algorithm may be concisely described in a few steps :    @xmath2    identify the brightest source in the data .",
    "using a model of the instrument s response function , subtract a small portion of signal out of the data , centered on the bright source .",
    "remember how much was subtracted and where .",
    "iterate the first three steps until some prescribed level in the data is reached .    from the stored record of subtractions ,",
    "rebuild individual sources .",
    "the implementation of the clean algorithm in this paper is built around a search through a multidimensional template space which covers a binary source s frequency and amplitude , sky position , inclination , polarization and orbital phase .",
    "the format of this paper will be as follows : section [ sec : modulation ] describes the modulation of gravitational wave signals by the motion of the lisa detector with respect to the sky .",

    "lisa s orbital motion around the sun introduces amplitude , frequency and phase modulation into the observed gravitational wave signal .",
    "the amplitude modulation results from the detector s antenna pattern being swept across the sky , the frequency modulation is due to the doppler shift from the relative motion of the detector and source , and the phase modulation results from the detector s varying response to the two gravitational wave polarizations .",
    "the general expression describing the strain measured by the lisa detector is quite complicated@xcite , but we need only consider low frequency , monochromatic plane waves . here",
    "low frequency is defined relative to the transfer frequency@xcite of the lisa detector , @xmath3 mhz .",

    "we set @xmath30 and @xmath31 in order to reproduce the initial conditions chosen by cutler@xcite .",
    "the doppler modulation depends on the source location and frequency , and on the velocity of the guiding center of the detector : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the separation of the detector from the barycenter , so @xmath34 is the light travel time from the guiding center of the detector to the barycenter .",
    "the expression for the strain in the detector can be re - arranged using double angle identities to read : @xmath35 where @xmath36 the amplitude modulation @xmath37 and phase modulation @xmath38 are given by @xmath39^{1/2 } \\\\      \\nonumber \\\\",

    "phase modulation is a consequence of the fact that the detector has different sensitivities to the two gravitational wave polarization states , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , characterized by the two detector beam patterns , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the variation of these beam patterns is a function of the detector motion ( see eq.([beam ] ) ) , and modulates the phase .",
    "phase modulation takes a similar form to the frequency modulation . expanding @xmath38 in a fourier sine series yields a signal @xmath69 again",
    ", the the fourier power spectrum of @xmath45 has sidebands about the carrier frequency @xmath46 , spaced by the modulating frequency @xmath40 .",
    "the main difference is that the fourier amplitude of the @xmath70 sideband ( located at @xmath71 ) is given by @xmath72 since the @xmath73 s for lisa are independent of frequency ( at least in the low frequency approximation used here ) , the bandpass of the phase modulated signal is independent of the carrier frequency .",
    "empirically we find the bandwidth @xmath74 mhz .",
    "it is possible to combine the amplitude , frequency and phase modulations together to arrive at an analytic expression for the full signal modulation .",
    "the carrier frequency @xmath46 develops sidebands spaced by the modulation frequency @xmath40 .",
    "the total modulation is most easily computed beginning from ( [ sbasic ] ) .",
    "one can write @xmath75 where the small number of non - zero fourier coefficients can be attributed to the quadrupole approximation for the beam pattern . the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be read off from ( [ beam ] ) in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath16 .",
    "our next task is to fourier expand @xmath79 and @xmath80 , being careful to take into account the fact that we are doing finite time fourier transforms , so @xmath46 will not be an integer multiple of @xmath40 .",

    "the limited bandwidth of the various modulations allows us to restrict the sums : @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . using ( [ quick ] ) we can compute the discrete fourier transform of @xmath45 very efficiently .",
    "the source identification and subtraction scheme used in this work depends on the development and use of a template bank covering a large parameter space . as such",
    ", issues related to efficient computing are of interest in order to make the problem tractable in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "a number of simplifying factors allow the problem to be compactified significantly , with great savings in computational efficiency .",
    "the quantities @xmath76 and @xmath77 only depend on @xmath96 and @xmath16 , so they can be pre - computed and stored .",
    "the complete template bank can then be built using ( [ quick ] ) by stepping through a grid in @xmath46 , @xmath97 and the ratio @xmath98 .",
    "the computational saving as compared to directly generating @xmath45 for each of the six search parameters is a factor of @xmath99 in computer time .",
    "another big saving in computer time is based on the following observation : the fourier expansions of sources @xmath100 and @xmath101 with all parameters equal save their frequencies , which differ by an integer multiple , @xmath102 , of the modulation frequency @xmath40 , are related : @xmath103 thus , so long as @xmath104 , we have @xmath105 .",
    "this allows us to use a set of templates generated at a frequency @xmath46 to cover frequencies between @xmath106 .",
    "these savings mean that our fourier space approach to calculating the template bank are a factor of @xmath107 times faster than a direct computation in the time domain !",
    "with the exception of systems that involve supermassive black holes , all of the binary systems that can be detected by lisa are well described by the post - newtonian approximation to general relativity .",
    "most of these sources can be adequately described as circular newtonian binaries , and the gravitational waves they produce can be calculated using the quadrupole approximation . in terms of these approximations ,",
    "a circular newtonian binary produces waves propagating in the @xmath53 direction with amplitudes @xmath108 where @xmath109 here @xmath110 is the distance between mass @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the distance between the source and the observer , and @xmath114 is a unit vector parallel to the binary s angular momentum vector .",
    "the gravitational waves have frequency @xmath115 the generalization to elliptical newtonian binaries is given in peters and mathews@xcite .",
    "they found that elliptical binaries produce gravitational waves at harmonics of the orbital frequency @xmath116 . for small eccentricities ,",
    "most of the power is radiated into the second harmonic , with the portion of the power radiated into higher harmonics increasing with increasing eccentricity . from a data analysis perspective ,",
    "an eccentric binary looks like a collection of circular binaries located at the same position on the sky , with frequencies separated by multiples of @xmath116 .",
    "one strategy to search for eccentric binaries would be to conduct a search for individual circular binaries , then check to see if binaries at a certain location form part of a harmonic series .",
    "if they do , the relative amplitude of the harmonics can be used to determine the eccentricity .",
    "the polarization angle of a circular binary is related to its angular momentum vector orientation , @xmath117 , by @xcite @xmath118 the inclination of a circular binary , @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 it follows that the amplitude and phase modulation depend on four parameters .",
    "two are the sky position @xmath12 and the other two are either the the angular momentum direction @xmath121 , or the polarization angle @xmath16 and the inclination @xmath119 .",
    "we found @xmath122 to be easier to work with as the quadrupole degeneracy between sources with parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 is explicit in these coordinates .",

    "because of the quadrupole degeneracy discussed above , we restrict the range of the orbital phase : @xmath133 .",
    "the effects of amplitude , frequency and phase modulation on two binary sources with barycenter frequencies of 10 and 1 mhz are shown in figures [ modulation01 ] and [ modulation001 ] respectively .",
    "the sources have all parameters equal save their frequencies , and are located close to the galactic center .",
    "we see that frequency modulation dominates at 10 mhz , while frequency and phase modulation become comparable at 1 mhz .",
    "one of the main effects of the modulations is to spread the power across a bandwidth @xmath134 .",
    "this , combined with lisa s antenna pattern , means that the strain in the detector is often considerably less than the strain of the wave .",
    "the effect can be quantified in terms of the amplitude of the detector response , @xmath135 , and the intrinsic amplitude of the source @xmath136 .",

    ", the templates can be spaced more widely .",
    "the doppler metric depends on only four parameters . taking constant slices through the parameter space for any two of the four will produce a metric which can be used to plot level curves of the overlap function @xmath192 as a function of two parameters .",

    "one rather surprising result is that the template overlap drops very quickly with @xmath196 . according to nyquist s theorem , the frequency resolution observations of time @xmath197 should equal @xmath198 .",
    "but we see from figure [ overlapfphi ] that the overlap drops to 90% for @xmath199 .",
    "( since we are using @xmath200 year , it so happens that the nyquist frequency @xmath201 equals the modulation frequency @xmath40 . )    since the metric ( [ met ] ) was derived by neglecting amplitude and phase modulation , it only gives an approximate determination of the template overlap .",
    "moreover , the approximate metric neglects the @xmath122 dependence completely . in order to have a more reliable determination of the template overlap we generated a large template bank and studied the template overlap directly .",

    "setting @xmath203 gives us the metric on the sky 2-sphere : @xmath204 it is clear from this form of the metric that the angular resolution improves at higher frequencies , and that the metric is not that of a round 2-sphere .",

    "what the metric can not tell us about are the non - local degeneracies that occur in parameter space .",
    "a mild example of a non - local degeneracy can be seen in figure [ numoverlapsky02 ] , where there are secondary maxima in the template overlap in the southern hemisphere .",
    "physically this occurs because the dominant doppler modulation is unable to distinguish between sources above and below the equator .",
    "this strong degeneracy is ameliorated by the amplitude and phase modulations , which are sensitive to which hemisphere the source is located in . in the course of applying the gclean procedure we discovered several other much stronger non - local parameter degeneracies . by",
    "far the worst were those that involved frequency and sky location .",
    "the secondary maxima sometimes had overlaps as high as 90% .",

    "we will return to this issue when discussing the source identification and reconstruction procedure .",
    "deciding what level of template spacing is acceptable depends on two factors : the signal - to - noise level and computing resources . given a signal - to - noise level of snr , there is no point having the template overlap exceeding @xmath230% . for the searches described in the next section we made a trade - off between coverage and speed , and chose template spacings that gave a minimum template overlap of @xmath231 in each parameter direction ( _ i.e. _ with all parameters equal save the one that is varied ) .",
    "we chose to study sources with frequencies near 5 mhz , and used a uniform template grid with spacings @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "a better approach would be to vary the template spacing according to where the templates lie in parameter space . as explained earlier , each set of @xmath237 templates",
    "can be used to cover a frequency range of @xmath238 . at worst",
    ", a source may lie half way between two templates , so a @xmath231 template overlap translates into a @xmath239 source overlap .",
    "after the coarse template bank has been used to find a best match with the data , we refine the search in the neighborhood of the best match using templates that are spaced twice as finely in each parameter direction .    to implement the gclean procedure ,",
    "a template bank was constructed by gridding the sky using the healpix hierarchical , equal area pixelization scheme @xcite .",
    "the healpix centers provide sky locations @xmath240 to build up families of templates distributed across the parameters @xmath241 .",
    "in order to construct a demonstration of the gclean method , it is necessary not only to characterize the binary signals themselves , but also the noise in the detector .",
    "instrumental noise can have important consequences for the gclean process , particularly in low signal to noise ratio situations , where random features in the noise spectrum of the instrument could conspire to approximate the modulated signal from a binary .",
    "the total output of the interferometer is given by the sum of the signal and the noise : @xmath242 assuming the noise is gaussian , it can be fully characterized by the expectation values @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the one - sided noise power spectral density .",

    "the procedure for subtraction is intimately tied to the task of source identification , as sources with overlapping bandwidths interfere with each other .",
    "overlapping sources have to be identified and removed in a simultaneous , iterative procedure called the gclean algorithm .",

    "the source vector @xmath255 has dimension @xmath260 , where the factor of two accounts for the real and imaginary parts of the fourier signal .",
    "we typically considered frequency windows of size @xmath261 and observation times of @xmath262 year , so @xmath263 . by contrast , the number of templates used in a search over that data stream is of order @xmath264 .",
    "this discrepancy in size naturally leads to the possibility of multiple solutions , implying that the problem is ill posed . what gclean does is return a best - fit solution in much the same vein as a singular value decomposition .",
    "the first step in the gclean procedure is to consider the inner product of each template @xmath265 with the source vector @xmath266 , which represents the data stream from the interferometer .",
    "the `` best fit '' template , @xmath258 , is identified as the template with the largest overlap with @xmath255 , and a small amount @xmath267 is subtracted off : @xmath268 where @xmath269 is gclean s best estimate of @xmath255 .",
    "the template @xmath258 and amount removed are recorded for later reconstruction .",
    "the procedure is iterated until only a small fraction of the original power remains ( for the simulations presented below , the fraction was chosen to be @xmath270 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the data stream that remains after this process is not the cleaned data stream . by design gclean",
    "will remove a pre - set fraction of the original power , no matter what the original signal is composed of .",
    "it is only after reconstructing the sources from the gclean record that we can meaningfully attempt to remove a source from the data stream .",
    "the pieces which are subtracted off in the gclean procedure are assumed to be portions of individual sources @xmath256 , the ensemble of which form the total signal @xmath255 ; during _ reconstruction _",
    "these pieces are resummed into representations of the individual sources .",
    "the gclean procedure can not produce a perfect match with a raw data stream from lisa , due to the discrete griding of parameter space , the interference between the frequency components of different sources and instrument noise .",
    "these effects serve to generate subtracted elements which are close , but not identical to each other .",
    "the task during reconstruction is to identify which combination of subtracted elements are close enough together that they are considered to be manifestations of a single source .",
    "reconstruction is implemented by finding the brightest element in the list of saved matches produced by gclean , and computing the overlap of this element with all other saved elements . for a given overlap threshold ,",
    "all sources with strong overlap are considered to be `` close '' , and are summed together to represent a single source .",
    "the procedure is iterated over the remaining saved elements until every element in the gclean record has contributed to a source .",
    "the frequency and source location parameters for the reconstructed sources are taken to be a weighted average of all the matches contributing to that source , where the weighting is given by the individual match amplitudes .",
    "the procedure is complicated by the non - local parameter degeneracies discussed in section [ subsec : overlapparams ] .",
    "the reconstruction may combine contributions that are close in terms of template overlap , but far apart in terms of the template metric .",
    "it makes no sense to average the parameters of metrically distant templates . for this reason we only use contributions that are metrically close when calculating the weighted averages of the source parameters",

    "if we simply add together the @xmath272 contributions identified by gclean , the amplitude of the reconstructed source will equal @xmath274 in other words , gclean will tend to under estimate the amplitude of a source . to compensate ,",
    "we multiply the initial reconstruction by a factor of @xmath275 to arrive at the final reconstruction which gives a better estimate of @xmath135 . using this estimate , along with the weighted averages for @xmath213",
    ", we can use equation [ amps ] to calculate @xmath271 .",
    "unfortunately , any errors in the determination of @xmath276 adversely affect our determination of @xmath271 . because of this , the intrinsic amplitude of a source , @xmath271 , is usually the worst determined quantity .",
    "the reconstruction procedure usually produces more reconstructed sources than there were sources in the input data stream .",
    "most of these additional `` sources '' have very small amplitudes , and their existence can be attributed to detector noise or the formation of a blended version of two or more real sources .",
    "for this reason , we only consider reconstructed sources with an amplitude that exceeds the noise in the detector .",
    "occasionally gclean gets confused and produces two fits to a single source that are nearby in parameter space , but not close enough to have been identified as one source .",

    "it is clear from the @xmath282 values that the first three reconstructed sources played a much more significant role in the gclean procedure than the two spurious sources . in terms of the amount of signal removed during the the gclean procedure , the reconstructed sources had signal to noise ratios of @xmath283 , @xmath284 , @xmath285 , @xmath286 , and @xmath287 respectively .",

    "the strain spectral densities for the sources and their reconstructions are shown in figure [ 3recon ] .",
    "the reconstruction procedure underestimates the amplitudes of sources 2 and 3 .",
    "this can be attributed to the power lost to spurious sources in the gclean procedure .",
    "the cleaned strain spectral density shown in figure [ 3strain ] was produced by subtracting the three reconstructed sources shown in figure [ 3recon ] from the input data stream .",
    "the residual strain is down by a factor of @xmath289 from the input level , but is still considerably larger than the detector noise .",
    "the goal of future work will be to improve the source identification and subtraction procedure to the point where multiple sources with overlapping signals can be removed from the lisa data stream leaving a residual that is comparable to the instrument noise .",
    "the gclean algorithm described here is only the first step in a program to understand how to remove binaries from the lisa data stream . in particular , the limitation of the simulations presented here are for small numbers of binaries , and at frequencies above the expected regime where multiple overlapping binaries contribute power in every bin of the power spectrum ( this occurs at @xmath290 mhz , for an assumed bin width of @xmath291 ) .",
    "a key question is how effectively can gclean identify binaries which have merged together to form a confusion limited background ? while gclean will subtract any signal out of the data stream down to a prescribed level in total power , using as many templates as necessary to remove the `` signal '' , the real question is how well can it identify individual sources for later removal ?",
    "information theory predicts an ultimate bound on the number of binaries which can be fit out of the lisa data stream @xcite , and an important question is how closely can gclean approach this optimal limit",
    ".    a great deal of work has yet to be done in the area of optimizing the gclean procedure and making it an effective tool in the lisa data analysis arsenal ; many of them are obvious extensions to the initial foray presented in this work .",
    "of particular interest is extending gclean to work with multiple data streams .",
    "the design of the lisa observatory provides three different data streams , which can be combined in various ways .",
    "as currently implemented , gclean only uses a single data stream .",
    "we are in the process of upgrading the algorithm so that all data streams are used .",
    "it is our hope that some of the parameter degeneracies described in section [ subsec : degenerate ] will be broken when more than one interferometer signal is used . at the very least",
    ", we expect the parameter estimation to be improved",
    ". it would also be interesting to see how much better the algorithm performs if we use more than one year of observations .",
    "the placement of templates in parameter space is an area where improvements in efficiency can be implemented .",
    "templates now are spaced for convenience ( _ e.g. _ , points on the sky are spaced on the healpix centers , which are effective for visualization ) , but efficient template spacing should be developed based on the local values of the metric on the template space .",
    "there are also several unresolved questions about the gclean algorithm and the ultimate limits of its performance on real scientific data .",
    "of particular interest is how will gclean perform when other signals , such as those from supermassive black hole binaries , are present in the data ?",
    "the research presented here has been for the case where only circular newtonian binaries are present in the data stream .",
    "it is clear from the way gclean is designed to work that it will indiscriminately remove signals from a data stream ; this has important implications for how gclean should be included in the approach to lisa data analysis .",
    "how will gclean deal with chirping binaries , or signals from extreme - mass ratio inspirals ? can gclean be used in a sequential analysis strategy , where it is used to first subtract out monochromatic binaries before looking for other gravitational wave events , or do all signals have to be simultaneously gcleaned using templates for each individual type of source ?    there may be better ways to extract the best fit parameter values for the reconstructed sources .",
    "currently we use a weighted average of the parameters that describe the templates used to build up the reconstructed source .",
    "a better approach may be to take each reconstructed source and use a hierarchical search through parameter space to find which set of parameters give the best match to the reconstructed source .",
    "another avenue of research is devising better strategies for accurately fitting sources .",
    "one idea is to attempt _ multi - fitting _ , where gclean removes more than one source at a time .",
    "the parameter space scales as @xmath292 , where @xmath272 is the number of sources which the algorithm is attempting to subtract out at once . with this in mind , it is obvious that one would have to establish initial estimates of the parameters from a standard gclean pass in order to narrow the search area of the parameter space used in the multi - fitting .",
    "an aspect of the subtraction enterprise which might benefit from such a procedure is what to do with orphaned sources which are generated during reconstruction but do not meet the threshold requirements to be included in the final list of identified sources .",
    "these orphans represent subtractions on the part of gclean which arise from either fluctuations in the detector noise which produces a close match with templates , or more commonly , interference between the signals of multiple sources which produced a strong match during the gclean iterations .",
    "this type of subtraction is inevitable , as gclean has no _ a priori _ way of distinguishing interfering sources from isolated sources ; it relies only on its ability to match the current version of the data stream to its space of templates .",
    "there are many obvious avenues of refinement which should be pursued in future work to develop the gclean algorithm .",
    "we are working on several of the issues described above , and we encourage others to pursue aspects of the problem which are of interest to them . to aid in the exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of the gclean algorithm ,",
    "the analysis codes used to produce the results in this paper will be made available to the scientific community through the working groups of the lisa project .",
