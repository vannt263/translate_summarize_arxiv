    "<S> finally , it should be noted that , in the boson - fermion collapsing processes of unstable and meta - stable states , the increasing boson / fermion densities make the two - body short - range interactions ( e.g. @xmath113-wave scattering processes ) and three - body ( or higher ) collisions more effective . </S>",
