    "with the rapid advancement in observational techniques cosmological parameters have been measured with unprecedented precision . in step , the evidence of a dark matter ( dm ) component in the universe has been steadily strengthened .",
    "the planck satellite mission @xcite reveals that the directly observable baryon density of the universe is only about @xmath8 , whereas dark matter constitutes about @xmath9 of the total energy of the universe , the rest is due to dark energy .",
    "this partitioning is along the lines indicated earlier by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe @xcite and other observations .",
    "recently , on the basis of measurements made at the international space station , the ams-02 collaboration @xcite has published striking indications for an excess of the positron to electron ratio which could be an indirect evidence for dark matter .",
    "this further sharpens similar observations from pamela @xcite and fermi - lat @xcite .    on the particle physics side the standard model",
    "( sm ) is a major success in explaining physics up to the tev scale and has been repeatedly tested at collider experiments .",
    "very recently the discovery of a higgs particle @xcite has put the sm on a stronger footing . yet",
    "the model leaves a few pertinent questions unanswered , e.g. , existence of neutrino masses , matter - antimatter asymmetry , the hierarchy problem , etc .",
    "moreover , the standard model does not solve the dm conundrum as there is no suitable candidate that can fulfill the requirement .",
    "although initially neutrinos or axions were hoped to be the required dm particle , from present day cosmological observations they are disfavoured .",
    "the requirement of a dark matter candidate has been one of the important motivations to go beyond sm .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is by far the most popular and thus extensively studied beyond - standard - model scenario .",
    "the imposition of a discrete symmetry ",
    "r - parity  ensures the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which can be a competent dm candidate .",
    "alternative variants within the susy framework predict different lsps . for a review of dark matter in the supersymmetric context",
    "see , for example , @xcite . a number of dm candidates have also been put forward in non - supersymmetric scenarios . in little higgs models , for example ,",
    "a conserved discrete symmetry , known as t - parity , assures the stability of the lightest t - odd particle , which is typically a heavy photon @xcite and it can be a dark matter candidate .",
    "a common theme is that in any model attempting to address the dark matter question , there is some @xmath0 symmetry that makes the lightest symmetry - odd particle stable and , needless to say , that particle should also satisfy the cosmological observational data , such as relic density .",
    "extra - dimensional models , an alternate extension of the sm , also predict their own dark matter candidate . in this work",
    "we study a model @xcite where all the sm fields can propagate in the bulk .",
    "we consider models with one extra spacelike flat compactified dimension , @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the radius of compactification , this coordinate can be considered to run from 0 to @xmath12 . all particles  scalars , spin-1/2 fermions , and gauge bosons ",
    "are represented by five - dimensional fields .",
    "these are often conveniently expressed in terms of towers of four - dimensional kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .    in the simplest model",
    "the zero - modes of the kk - towers are the sm particles .",
    "the kk states of all particles at the @xmath13-th level have the same mass , @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , a @xmath0 symmetry ( @xmath15 ) needs to be imposed to ensure the observed chirality of zero - mode fermions .",
    "the extra dimension is compactified , in this manner , on an orbifold @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath15 symmetry leads to a conserved kk - parity @xmath17 , where @xmath13 is the kk - level .",
    "the sm particles ( @xmath13 = 0 ) are of even parity while the kk - states of the first level are odd .",
    "the conservation of kk - parity ensures that the lightest @xmath18 particle can not decay to sm particles and hence is a potential dark matter candidate , the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) .",
    "this constitutes what is known as the universal extra dimension ( ued ) model .    the @xmath16 orbifold compactification results in fixed points at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "at these two points one can allow four - dimensional kinetic and mass terms for the kk - states .",
    "in fact , these terms are also required as counterterms for cut - off dependent loop - induced contributions @xcite of the five - dimensional theory . in the minimal universal extra - dimensional models ( mued )",
    "@xcite these terms are fixed by requiring that the five - dimensional loop contributions are exactly compensated at the cutoff scale @xmath21 and the boundary values of the corrections , e.g. , logarithmic mass corrections of kk particles , can be taken to be zero at the scale @xmath21 .",
    "these loop contributions can remove the mass degeneracy among states at the same kk - level @xmath13 .",
    "the viability of the lkp  a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp )  as a dark matter candidate satisfying the cosmological relic density constraint has been examined earlier @xcite .",
    "these studies within the context of ued or mued at various levels of sophistication @xcite  e.g. , inclusion of channels of scattering and coannihilation  indicate that the @xmath13 = 1 excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson @xmath22 could be a possible candidate for the dark matter of the universe .    in this work",
    "we allow boundary terms to be unrestricted by the special choice in mued . in this sense",
    "the model can be termed non - minimal ued ( nmued ) .",
    "however , we do maintain the boundary terms to be equal at both fixed points .",
    "this will preserve a discrete @xmath0 symmetry which exchanges @xmath23 and makes the lkp stable .",
    "the compactification radius @xmath11 and the cut - off @xmath21 are the two basic parameters of these extra - dimensional models and there have been several explorations of constraints on them in ued and its variants .",
    "it has been shown that in these models to one - loop order electroweak observables receive finite corrections @xcite .",
    "thus it is not unreasonable to compare the predictions of the theory with experimental data to set bounds on @xmath11 and @xmath21 .",
    "for example , from muon @xmath24 @xcite , flavour changing neutral currents @xcite , @xmath25 decay @xcite , the @xmath26 parameter @xcite , and other electroweak precision tests @xcite , it is found that @xmath27 gev .",
    "the possibility of a not too high @xmath28 motivates the continuing search for signatures of the model at the tevatron and the lhc @xcite and also at the ilc or clic @xcite in the future .",
    "here we use the dark matter relic density constraint to place limits on @xmath28 taking the lkp as the dm candidate .",
    "we consider the impact of the boundary - localized kinetic terms ( blkt ) on the masses of the kk states and , to our knowledge for the first time , also on the kk couplings . in the process",
    "the masses of the kk excitations deviate from their ued value of @xmath14 and the couplings of these particles exhibit a departure from the standard model values .",
    "we show that together this makes additional room for the possible values of the compactification radius beyond what is permitted in ued .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the nmued scenario with boundary - localized kinetic terms . to set up the notation this",
    "is followed by a recapitulation of the steps in the estimation of dark matter relic density .",
    "we come next to our results where we identify the regions of parameter space already excluded by the current limits on the relic density . in the following section we consider the possibility of direct detection of the nmued dark matter candidate for the range of parameters consistent with the relic density bound .",
    "we end with our summary and conclusions .",

    "universal extra dimension models have emerged as an attarctive option for beyond the standard model physics . in this model",
    "all sm particles are complemented with kk - excitations which are equispaced in mass .",
    "the interaction strengths of these states are determined entirely by the sm .",
    "many aspects of the model ranging from constraints from precision measurements to collider searches have been examined in the literature .",
    "signals for ued are being actively looked for at the lhc .",
    "one of the less attractive predictions of ued is the mass degeneracy of kk - excitations of all sm particles at any fixed level .",
    "a remedy for this is not unknown .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that five - dimensional radiative corrections split the degeneracy in a definite way determined by the sm charges of the zero - mode states .",
    "the corrections are encoded as contributions to the four - dimensional lagrangians located at the the two fixed points of the orbifold . in this version of the model , known as minimal ued",
    ", the practice has been to assume that the couplings of the kk excitations continue to be as for the sm particles .",
    "our work is on a further generalisation of this model where the extra four - dimensional kinetic terms located at the two fixed points are of a strength whch is a free parameter and varies from particle to particle . to ensure the conservation of a @xmath0 parity the strengths",
    "are taken equal at the two fixed points .",
    "this ensures the stability of the lkp .",
    "the blkt parameters determine the wave - functions of the kk - excitations in the fifth dimension , @xmath10 , as well as their masses .",
    "further , the non - trivial @xmath10-dependence of the wave - functions affects the couplings of the kk - excitations ; these are also controlled by the blkt parameters .",
    "we allow different blkt strengths for the various sm particles and ensure that @xmath1 is the lkp .",
    "we also examine the alternative of a @xmath3 lkp but find that the relic density is too small for a wimp mass @xmath192 1 tev .",
    "we conclude that @xmath3 can not serve the role of a single component dark matter when its mass is within the lhc range .",
    "we make a note of the bounds on the lkp dark matter particle mass which follow from the overclosure of the universe .    in this work",
    "we consider dark matter in this nmued scenario retaining the impact of blkt parameters on the masses _ and _ the couplings .",

    "we find that in this process the allowed range of the compactification scale @xmath28 is much relaxed from its narrow ued prediciton of 0.5 - 0.6 tev .",
    "we discuss the prospects of direct detection of the nmued dark matter candidate keeping the relic density constraints in mind .",
    "as an example , we evaluate the spin - dependent and spin - independent scattering cross section of dark matter off xenon nuclei .",
