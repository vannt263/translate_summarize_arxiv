    "the advent of trigonometric parallaxes for @xmath510@xmath6 stars from the _ gaia _ mission promises to revolutionize many areas of stellar and galactic astrophysics , including exoplanet science .",
    "for example , with eventual expected precision in the parallax of @xmath720  @xmath8as for bright exoplanet host stars , it should be possible to determine the stellar and planet radii and masses directly and empirically with accuracies of 35% ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "already , the _ gaia _ first data release ( dr1 ; * ? ? ? * ) provides parallaxes for @xmath52 million _",
    "tycho-2 _ stars ( the tgas stars ) with a nominal precision of @xmath70.3  mas and with a quoted systematic uncertainty at present of 0.3  mas .",
    "the results from dr1 are based on only 14 months of observations , and use external information in the form of earlier positions from the _ hipparcos _ @xcite and _ tycho-2 _ @xcite catalogs to help remove degeneracies ( the _ tycho - gaia _ astrometric solution ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally , they rely on very provisional and as yet incomplete calibrations , and as a result the astrometric products including the parallaxes are still preliminary .",
    "nonetheless , the new parallaxes represent such an improvement in both quality and quantity that they are certain to be used by the community for a wide range of astrophysical applications , at least until future _ gaia _ releases supersede them .",
    "it is essential , therefore , to assess the on - sky delivered performance of these parallaxes from _ gaia _ dr1 , especially the presence of any unexpected biases .",
    "this is particularly important in light of the experience from _ hipparcos _ , which suffered a significant bias in at least the case of the pleiades cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a check requires a set of benchmark stars whose parallaxes are determined independently and with an accuracy that is at least as good as that expected from _",
    "gaia _ dr1 .",
    "@xcite assembled a sample of 158 eclipsing binary stars ( ebs ) whose radii and effective temperatures are known empirically and precisely , such that their bolometric luminosities are determined to high precision ( via the stefan - boltzmann relation ) and therefore independent of assumed distance .",
    "@xcite reported new , accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes for these ebs which , together with the precisely known bolometric luminosities , yields a highly precise distance ( or parallax ) .",
    "the precision of the parallaxes for this eb sample was predicted by @xcite to be @xmath7190  @xmath8as on average .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath51.5 better than the median precision of 320  @xmath8as for _ gaia _",
    "dr1 @xcite .",
    "it is even somewhat superior to the expected _ gaia _ dr1 precision floor of 240  @xmath8as .",
    "these eb parallaxes can therefore readily serve as distance benchmarks for the trigonometric parallaxes reported by _",
    "dr1 , and in particular can be used to assess the presence of any systematics .    in this letter",
    ", we report the results of testing the _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes against the @xcite eb benchmark sample .",

    "we excluded from our analysis any ebs identified as potentially problematic in @xcite .",

    "the least - squares linear best fit , weighted by the measurement uncertainties in both quantities @xcite , is @xmath10 .",
    "while this indicates a good 1-to-1 agreement to first order , the coefficient of 1.03@xmath10.01 could be interpreted as a modest global difference of _ scale _ in the _ gaia _ parallaxes relative to the eb parallaxes . however , considering all of the available evidence instead suggests a small _ offset _ in the _ gaia _ parallaxes as we now discuss .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta_plx_hist ] presents the overall distribution of parallax differences in the sense of @xmath11 .",
    "the distribution appears roughly symmetric and normally distributed , with perhaps a sharper peak and more extended wings than a gaussian , and there is a clear offset relative to zero .",

    "[ sec : intro ] . ]",
    "@xcite noted that a number of the ebs used in that study are known triple or quadruple systems .",
    "in general these companions contribute very little to the total system light , and @xcite found no evidence for significant systematics in their predicted parallaxes .",
    "nonetheless , the offset that we find above for the _ gaia _ parallaxes is small and could potentially have gone unnoticed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the effect of additional light contribution to the ebs by companions would be in the sense of making the eb stars appear brighter , therefore inferred to be closer , and in turn the _ gaia _ distances interpreted as too long ( parallax too small ) .    in _ gaia _ dr1 , 12 of our ebs have known companions ( see table  [ tab : data ] ; one additional eb with a known companion is already excluded by the cuts discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] ) .",
    "these ebs are indicated in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_plx_hist ] , which shows the two largest outliers to be triples .",
    "excluding all of the triples results in a parallax offset of @xmath13 mas , consistent with that determined for the full sample , though slightly smaller .",
    "overall , from the eb sample , a systematic offset in the _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes of @xmath15 to @xmath16  mas is indicated . for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt the rounded value between these estimates of @xmath17  mas .",
    "the official _ gaia _ dr1 documentation states :  there are colour dependent and spatially correlated systematic errors at the level of @xmath10.2  mas . over large spatial scales ,",
    "the parallax zero - point variations reach an amplitude of @xmath10.3  mas .... furthermore , averaging parallaxes over small regions of the sky will not reduce the uncertainty on the mean below the 0.3  mas level . \"",
    "our finding of a mean parallax offset of @xmath18 mas ( sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_plx_hist ] ) corroborates this statement , and further quantifies it using an independent benchmark sample of ebs with accurately known distances @xcite .    in principle",
    "this offset could be due to systematics in one or more of the eb parameters from which the eb distances are determined .",
    "if so , one might especially suspect the eb @xmath19 values : unlike the stellar radii , for example , which are determined from simple geometry , the @xmath19 values are determined from spectral analysis and/or spectral typing and/or color relations . the slope of the fitted relation in fig .  [",
    "fig : pxvspx ] would imply an error in the eb distance scale of @xmath53% , which in turn would require a systematic error in @xmath19 of @xmath51.5% ( because @xmath20 ) or @xmath5105  k given the typical @xmath19 of the eb sample .",
    "the sense of the offset is that the ebs would have to be systematically too cool .",
    "however , we do not consider this to be a likely possibility , for multiple reasons .",
    "first , @xcite found no evidence for a systematic offset of the eb parallaxes relative to the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes which , even at the somewhat poorer precision of @xmath51  mas , should have been apparent .",
    "@xcite compare the _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes against @xmath587,000 _ hipparcos _ stars in common , finding a statistically significant average offset just under @xmath21  mas , smaller than , but in the same sense as the offset we find among our eb sample .",
    "second , while systematics among various @xmath19 scales can be of order 100  k ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unlikely that they should produce a net offset of this entire magnitude in a sample of 111 ebs spanning a large range of @xmath19 , given the different methodologies and calibrations adopted by the various authors .",
    "finally , we have directly examined the degree to which @xmath22 might correlate with @xmath19 in the eb sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_vs_eb_plx ] , upper right ) , finding very weak evidence for a correlation : the regression relation has a coefficient of determination @xmath23 ; this parameter explains only 13% of the variance in @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , a kendall s @xmath24 non - parametric correlation test gives a probability of 51% that @xmath22 and @xmath19 are uncorrelated .",
    "( we checked that the parallax _ ratio _ versus @xmath19 is also not significantly correlated . ) incidentally , this also suggests little to no dependence of @xmath22 with color , since @xmath19 can be taken as a proxy for color .     and @xmath25 , eb @xmath26 , and @xmath27 mag .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    with a current sample of 111 ebs that overlap with the _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes , it is difficult to ascertain with certainty whether any higher - order dependencies are at work beyond a simple offset . nonetheless , it is possible that the parallax offset we observe is a function of one or more parameters .",
    "we have considered some obvious possible parameters , including distance , and brightness .",
    "these are represented in figure  [ fig : delta_vs_eb_plx ] .",
    "there is some evidence for a dependence of @xmath22 on distance and/or brightness , however it is difficult to gauge whether these modest distance and brightness dependencies are independent of one another . a priori ,",
    "a possible dependence on brightness may be more likely than a dependence on distance : because of the manner in which the trigonometric parallax measurements are made ( linear offsets on the detector ) , they are more likely to depend on parameters that affect the displacement calibration ( e.g. , color or brightness ) than the displacement itself . thus there is not strong evidence for a dependence of the offset with brightness or color , at least in our sample .",
    "the apparent correlation of @xmath22 with @xmath28 may be a consequence of the tendency for the ebs with the largest @xmath28 to be located in the ecliptic north , where we find the largest overall offset ( see below ) . in any event , among our 12 ebs with @xmath29  mas , the average offset is @xmath30  mas .",
    "thus , it appears that the offset vanishes for very small parallaxes , @xmath31 mas .",
    "this would be consistent with the findings of @xcite and also @xcite , who find good agreement with the _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes in separate samples of very distant cepheids with estimates based on period - luminosity relations .",
    "@xcite also find evidence for a parallax offset , in the same sense as we find , among the small number of very nearby , bright cepheids in their sample .",
    "finally , we have considered the possible spatial dependence of @xmath22 .",
    "there is evidence for a trend or difference by ecliptic latitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_eclip ] ) .",
    "the mean parallax offset for ebs in the northern ecliptic hemisphere is statistically significant with @xmath32  mas , whereas in the southern ecliptic hemisphere it is not significant with @xmath33  mas .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test gives a probability of 0.0001 that this difference could occur by chance .",
    "alternatively , the trend can be represented as a linear variation with latitude , @xmath34  mas ( @xmath3 in degrees ) .",

    "color represents eb brightness and symbol size is proportional to @xmath28 . ]",
    "the possibility that systematics in the _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes are dependent on ecliptic latitude was suggested in the _ gaia _ documentation @xcite .",
    "these authors reported that a comparison with parallaxes from the _ hipparcos _ mission indicates an overall statistically significant offset @xmath35  mas , the _ gaia _ values being smaller , but that the northern ecliptic hemisphere shows a larger offset of @xmath36  mas compared to the southern hemisphere ( @xmath37  mas ) .",
    "here we present evidence of a small but systematic offset in the average zero - point of the parallax measurements recently released by the _",
    "gaia _ mission of about @xmath38  mas , in the sense that the _ gaia _ values are too small",
    ". we also find evidence to suggest that the offset is a function of ecliptic latitude .",
    "the offset in the northern ecliptic hemisphere is @xmath00.38@xmath10.06  mas and @xmath00.05@xmath10.09  mas in the southern ecliptic hemisphere . alternatively",
    ", the offset may also be represented as a linear function of the ecliptic latitude , @xmath3  ( @xmath39 ) , according to @xmath2  mas .",
    "to apply the correction , this ( negative ) offset must be _ subtracted _ from the reported _ gaia _ dr1 parallaxes . at present",
    "we can only confirm that the offset is statistically valid for relatively large parallaxes , @xmath40  mas .",
    "the reference for this determination is a set of more than 100 independently inferred parallaxes from a benchmark sample of well - studied eclipsing binaries with a wide range of brightnesses and distributed over the entire sky .",
    "this paper presents evidence of a _ difference _ between the _ gaia _ and eb parallaxes , which we have interpreted here as a systematic error in _ gaia _ after discussing the alternative .",
    "in particular , we have considered the possibility of a systematic offset in the eb effective temperature scale as a possible , but unlikely alternative explanation .",
    "it is expected that future releases of the _ gaia _ catalog will remove this small shift as the number of observations increases , calibrations are improved , and the astrometric solution transitions to a self - consistent global fit using only _ gaia _ data , independent of external astrometric information . indeed , these final trigonometric parallaxes may then be used to further refine the eb sample itself , such as improvements to the eb effective temperature scale . in the meantime , investigators using the parallax results from _ gaia _",
