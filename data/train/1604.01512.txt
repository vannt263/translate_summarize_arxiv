    ", a strong piezoelectric coupling has been shown to be an important tool in cooling nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) to their mechanical quantum ground state @xcite .",
    "such applications demand a strong piezoelectric material from the outset and that , in turn , requires a good insulator with a robust interplay between the underlying electronic and mechanic / lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have established that an hbn monolayer has among the highest specific piezoelectric coefficients ( @xmath5pc / n ) known @xcite .",
    "combined with the lowest surface mass density of all known piezoelectric crystals , this might allow for nems with as yet unknown force sensitivity @xcite .",
    "moreover , hbn could provide the piezoelectric coupling in a layered graphene / hbn heterostructure and thus allow for the electromechanical manipulation of graphene with an electric field .",
    "its strong piezoelectric characteristics , high mechanical stability , and easy handling make hbn a prime material for such technological applications .",
    "the lattice of ( isotropically deformed ) hbn does not belong to one of the 10 polar classes and hence , hbn exhibits no spontaneous polarization .",
    "however , it does sustain one when subjected to _",
    "anisotropic _ deformation . in this paper",

    "established that the dominant electronic contribution ( @xmath6 ) to the polarization arises from the @xmath7 valence band , and that it has the same sign as the remaining contribution from the @xmath8 valence bands @xcite .",
    "therefore , a minimal yet promising ansatz for the analytical description of piezoelectricity in hbn consists in focusing entirely on the @xmath7 bands . as we demonstrate ,",
    "the low energy bandstructure of the @xmath7 bands is already sufficient to derive results in qualitative and good quantitative agreement with dft calculations .",
    "due to the underlying honeycomb lattice , low energy electrons in hbn effectively behave as ( massive ) dirac fermions .",
    "this is similar to the situation in graphene , except for the mass term associated with the different orbital energies at the b and n atoms .",
    "the difference in electronegativity between the two species causes electron transfer from b to n within the @xmath8 bonds @xcite and results in a bond with an ionic character , in contrast to the purely covalent bond of graphene @xcite .",
    "the broken sublattice symmetry gives rise to the bandgap @xcite .",
    "such a model has already been used to describe the chirality - dependent piezoelectric response of hbn nanotubes @xcite . in the vicinity of the @xmath9 points in the hexagonal reciprocal lattice ,",

    "the second , electronic contribution arises from the induced electronic density and is the specific focus of this paper , computed within the quantum phase approach @xcite . from an _ ab - initio _ standpoint , a common strategy to identify these two contributions",
    "consists in ( i ) computing the _ electronic _ polarization as a function of strain while keeping the ions clamped and ( ii ) performing the same computation with fully relaxed ions , which yields the _ total _ ( electronic and ionic ) polarization .",
