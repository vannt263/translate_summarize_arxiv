    "the experimental observations of topological insulators @xcite and topological semimetals @xcite in electronic systems have inspired a great interest in condensed matter physics . consequently , this has led to the re - examination of band structures in bosonic systems .",
    "one of the areas of recent interest is the topological magnon bands in insulating ordered quantum magnets with inversion symmetry breaking @xcite , which allows the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) @xcite . unlike electronic charge particles ,",
    "magnons are charge - neutral bosonic quasiparticles and they do not experience a lorentz force and do not have conduction and valence bands . however , a temperature gradient can induce a heat current and the berry curvature induced by the dm soi acts as an effective magnetic field in momentum space .",
    "this leads to a thermal version of the anomalous hall effect characterized by a temperature dependent thermal hall conductivity as predicted theoretically @xcite and subsequently observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "they are also potential candidates for designing systems with low - dissipation applicable to spin - based computing or magnon spintronics @xcite .",

    "@xcite have shown that the magnon bands in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) anisotropic pyrochlore ferromagnets without dm soi form a magnon analogue of 3d electronic nodal - line semimetals @xcite .",
    "however , the concept of the quasi-2d magnon nodal - line has never been proposed in quantum magnets .",
    "it is interesting to seek for a 2d analogue of dirac magnon nodal - line . in principle",
    ", there are more quantum magnetic materials in quasi-2d forms than 3d forms . in addition ,",
    "quasi-2d quantum magnets are simpler to study and manipulate both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "nevertheless , the concept of 2d electronic dirac nodal - line semimetals has remained elusive for a while .",
    "it was recently put forward , and involves composite lattices such as mixed honeycomb and kagom lattices @xcite , mixed square lattice @xcite , and 2d trilayers @xcite , in which the mixed bands have the tendency to overlap in momentum space .",
    "a magnonic analogue of these systems should be of interest both theoretically and experimentally .    in this report , we propose a 2d dirac magnon loop ( or closed lines of dirac nodes ) as a direct analogue of 2d electronic dirac nodal - line semimetals @xcite .",
    "we utilize the honeycomb bilayer ferromagnet as an example , which can be realized in the chromium compounds crx@xmath2 ( x = br , cl , i ) with hexagonal lattices coupled by small interlayer interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the general results can be easily extended to other quasi-2d lattice structures with more than two sublattices in the unit cell .",
    "we show that in the realistic regime with the interlayer coupling ( @xmath1 ) smaller than the intralayer coupling ( @xmath0 ) , i.e. @xmath5 , there are dirac magnon loops centred at the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "they are protected by the coexistence of time - reversal symmetry , inversion symmetry , and translational invariance of the layers . in principle , the dm soi with strength @xmath6 can be allowed on the honeycomb lattice because of inversion symmetry breaking between the bonds of second - nearest neighbour sites @xcite . in stark contrast to 3d magnon nodal line",
    "for which the dm soi transforms the nodal line into weyl points @xcite , we show that the quasi-2d dirac magnon loops are robust against dm soi for @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the ferromagnetic hamiltonian of a bilayer honeycomb lattice applicable to the ferromagnetic hexagonal chromium compounds crx@xmath2 ( x = br , cl , i ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian can be approximated as @xmath7 the first term describes the intralayer nearest - neighbour ( nn ) interaction on the top ( @xmath8 ) and bottom ( @xmath9 ) layers repectively , and the second term is the interlayer interaction .",
    "the last term is the zeeman magnetic field in units of @xmath10 .",
    "we will assume that the top layer is placed right above the bottom layer forming aa - stacked pattern .",
    "the intralayer coupling is ferromagnetic @xmath11 and the small interlayer coupling can be ferromagnetic @xmath12 as in x = br , i @xcite or antiferromagnetic @xmath13 as in x = cl @xcite . in the presence of the magnetic field ,",
    "both cases can be treated simultaneously .",
    "the latter case recovers the former case at the saturation field @xmath14 ( see appendix ) . due to small interlayer coupling @xmath5",
