    "when a system of ( correlated ) electrons is sufficiently small , the electronic spectrum becomes discrete .",
    "such a discrete spectrum was directly measured for the first time by ralph , black and tinkham ( rbt ) @xcite , for ultrasmall al grains .",
    "this allowed them to study the nature of pairing correlations in a small superconductor in unprecedented detail .",
    "these experiments gave new actuality to an old and fundamental question : what is the lower size limit for superconductivity ?",
    "besides anderson s prediction @xcite that superconductivity breaks down once the single - particle mean level spacing @xmath4 becomes larger than the ( bulk ) superconducting gap @xmath2 , the finite size of a superconducting grain also manifests itself in its large charging energy , which effectively suppresses electron number fluctuation on the grain",
    ". hence superconductivity on small grains has to be formulated in a manifestly canonical way .",
    "after briefly introducing the experiments and a toy model which captures their essential features , we show how the entire crossover between the bulk bcs - like regime and the few - electron regime can be described theoretically by fixing the electron number on the grain and using either a projected bcs approach or , even better , a long - forgotten _ exact solution of the reduced bcs model hamiltonian_. both the projected bcs approach and the exact solution enable us ( i ) to significantly improve previous g.c .",
    "upper bounds on ground state energies , @xcite , in the latter case by giving the exact result ; ( ii ) to find in the crossover regime a remnant of the `` break - down of superconductivity '' obtained in g.c .  studies , at which the condensation energy changes from being extensive to practically intensive ; and ( iii ) to study this change by an _ explicit wave - function analysis _ , which shows in detail how the bcs limit is recovered for @xmath5 , and how for @xmath6 pairing correlations delocalize in energy space .      in rbt",
    "s experiments , an ultrasmall grain was used as central island in a single - electron transistor : it was connected via tunnel barriers to external leads and capacitively coupled to a gate , and its electronic spectrum determined by measuring the tunnel current through the grain as a function of transport voltage at a fixed temperature of 50mk . for a typical grain the radius was @xmath7 nm , and the crude order - of - magnitude free - electron estimate @xmath8 for the mean level spacing near @xmath9 yields @xmath10mev . the grain s charging energy was about @xmath11mev and therefore much larger than all other energy scales , such as the aluminum bulk gap ( @xmath12mev ) , typical values of the transport voltage ( @xmath13mv ) and the temperature .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the experimental tunneling spectrum , shown in fig .  [ fig : experimental - spectra ] , is the presence of a clear spectroscopic gap for the grain with even electron number and its absence for the odd grain .",
    "this reveals the presence of pairing correlations : in even grains , all excited states involve at least two bcs quasi - particles and hence lie significantly above the ground state , whereas odd grains _ always _ have at least one quasi - particle and excitations need not overcome an extra gap .    the charging energy , being the largest energy scale of the system , strongly suppresses particle number fluctuations on the grain and",
    "hence the discrete energies measured in rbt s experiments essentially correspond to the eigenspectrum of a grain with _",
    "fixed electron number @xmath0_. we therefore consider below an ultrasmall grain _ completely isolated _ from the rest of the world , e.g.  by infinitely thick oxide barriers .",
    "our main goal will be to elucidate , within a canonical framework , the nature of the pairing correlations in an ultrasmall grain at @xmath14 .",
    "to investigate the influence of pairing correlations , on the excitation spectrum of an ultrasmall grain , we model the grain by a reduced bcs - hamiltonian .",
    "it has been used before to describe small superconducting grains @xcite and was phenomenologically successful for @xmath15 @xcite , but probably is unrealistically simple for @xmath16 , for which it should rather be viewed as toy model : @xmath17 the @xmath18 create electrons in free time - reversed single - particle - in - a - box states @xmath19 , with discrete , uniformly spaced , doubly degenerate eigenenergies @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction scatters only time - reversed pairs of electrons within @xmath21 of @xmath9 .",
    "its dimensionless strength @xmath22 is related to the two material parameters @xmath2 and @xmath21 via the bulk gap equation @xmath23 .",
    "we chose @xmath24 , close to that of al @xcite .",
    "the level spacing @xmath4 determines the number @xmath25 of levels , taken symmetrically around @xmath9 , within the cutoff ; electrons outside the cutoff remain unaffected by the interaction and are thus neglected throughout .",
    "the most direct and easiest theoretical approach @xcite to describing an ultrasmall grain simply uses the well - known grand - canonical ( g.c . )",
    "variational bcs ansatz for the ground state of an even or odd grain ( subscript @xmath26 or 1 , respectively ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the amplitudes that level @xmath30 is doubly occupied or empty , respectively .",
    "note that on an odd grain one electron necessarily is unpaired ; to minimize its kinetic energy , it is put at the fermi energy ( @xmath31 ) . minimizing the energy expectation value @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath28",
    "yields the even and odd `` gap equations '' ( at @xmath14 ) : @xmath34 these are solved for the even and odd pairing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 as a function of level - spacing @xmath4 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is excluded from the odd sum .",
    "as predicted in 1959 by anderson , @xcite it turned out @xcite that above a critical level spacing the gap equation ceases to have a non - trivial solution : when the sample becomes too small , superconductivity breaks down .",
    "more surprising was the finding @xcite that the breakdown is _ parity - dependent _ : the odd @xmath38 vanishes already at a much smaller level spacing ( say @xmath39 ) than the even @xmath40 ( say @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is reflected in the condensation energy @xmath42 , which is measured relative to the energy of the respective uncorrelated fermi sea ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) : fig .",
    "[ fig : results](a ) below shows that the critical level spacing above which the g.c . results for @xmath45 reduce to zero is _ parity - dependent . _      while the g.c .",
    "bcs ansatz confirms anderson s prediciton , it is , however , clear that the approach has two problems : ( a ) it inherently contains fluctuations of the particle number @xmath0 which are not present in the actual grain system due to its large charging energy ; and ( b ) it fails to describe superconducting fluctuations for large level spacings @xmath3 , where it trivially yields @xmath46 .    for bulk systems , the fluctuations in @xmath0",
    "are negligibly small ( @xmath47 ) , and a more rigorous fixed-@xmath0 treatment would only correct the bcs ground state energy per electron @xcite by order @xmath48 , which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath49 . for ultrasmall systems , however , precisely such corrections are important and we will have to incorporate them .",
    "on the other hand , pairing correlations ( the redistribution of pairs from below to above @xmath50 ) can lower the condensation energy below zero even when @xmath51 . in this regime , pairing correlations are traditionally called `` superconducting fluctuations '' , which are evidently not captured adequately by the g.c .",
    "ansatz ( [ eq : bcsground ] ) .",
    "matveev and larkin ( ml ) @xcite calculated the energy lowering to logarithmic order for @xmath3 ( i.e.  @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , they are known @xcite to become important already in the crossover regime @xmath53 .    to adequately describe an ultrasmall superconducting grain we therefore must go beyond standard bcs theory by ( a ) fixing the particle number @xmath0 and ( b ) incorporating superconducting fluctuations .",
    "these ingredients will allow us to describe the full crossover between the bulk system , which is dominated by bcs superconductivity , and the few - electron system , which mainly shows superconducting fluctuations .",
    "in particular we shall study how , at the crossing of the two energy scales @xmath4 and @xmath2 , the break - down of superconductivity predicted by bcs theory is softened and how the fluctuations become dominant .",
    "our first crossover study @xcite adapts a method developed by dietrich , mang and pradal @xcite for shell modells of nuclei with pairing interaction to the case of ultrasmall metallic grains .",
    "this `` projected bcs '' ( pbcs ) method also is a variational approach , but projects ( before variation ) the trial wave - function onto a fixed electron number @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the parity ) : @xmath56 ( in the odd case @xmath57 again is replaced by @xmath58 . ) the integral over @xmath59 performs the projection onto the fixed electron pair number @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a normalization constant ensuring @xmath62 .",
    "again , the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are found by minimizing the energy expectation value of the _ projected _ wave - function @xmath63 while in the g.c .",
    "case the wave - function essentially can be described by a single parameter @xmath64 , in this case the minimization leads to a _ set _ of @xmath65 coupled non - linear equations which include projection integrals ( for details see @xcite ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we evaluate all integrals numerically ( using fast fourier transform routines ) .    in the limit @xmath49 at fixed @xmath66 , the pbcs theory reduces to the g.c .   bcs theory of ref .",
    "@xcite ( proving that the latter s @xmath0-fluctuations become negligible in this limit ) : the projection integrals can then be approximated by their saddle point values @xcite ; at the saddle , the variational equations decouple and reduce to the bcs gap equation while the saddle point condition fixes the _",
    "mean _ number of electrons to be @xmath65 . to check the opposite limit of @xmath3 where @xmath60 becomes small , the so - called fluctuation - dominated regime , we compared the pbcs results for @xmath67 with exact results , finding agreement to within , say , @xmath68 for @xmath69 . ) cited in @xcite for the total ground state energy @xmath70 .",
    "] this shows that superconducting fluctuations are automatically treated adequately in the pbcs approach .",
    "the advantages of the pbcs method relative to the g.c .",
    "one are ( a ) the similarity of the trial wave - function to the bcs wave function , allowing it to capture the bulk limit and , on the other hand , ( b ) the increase of variational degrees of freedom from one ( @xmath71 in the g.c .",
    "bcs theory ) to @xmath72 ( one for each single particle level minus 1 for fixing @xmath0 ) due to the projection onto a fixed particle number .",
    "these additional degrees of freedom allow the method to also capture the superconducting fluctuations for @xmath3 .",
    "because it works so well for @xmath73 and @xmath3 , one might hope that it acceptably describes the crossover regime @xmath53 , too .",
    "there it really amounts to an uncontrolled approximation , whose quality will be checked against exact results in the next section .      since the publication of @xcite we became aware of the fact that richardson had shown already in the mid-60 s @xcite , also in the context of nuclear physics , that the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) actually can ( for non - degenerate @xmath74 ) be found _ exactly _ by solving a set of @xmath60 coupled algebraic non - linear equations .",
    "richardson introduces electron pairs @xmath75 , which have the commutation relation @xmath76=\\delta_{jj'}(1 - 2b_j^\\dagger b_j)$ ] , and exploits the fact that in the hilbert space of non - singly - occupied states , the modified hamiltonian @xmath77 is equivalent to the @xmath78 of ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . solving @xmath79",
    "exactly would be trivial if the @xmath80 s would represent true bosons .",
    "however , they actually are `` hard - core bosons '' instead .",
    "richardson thus expresses the general ground state @xmath81 of the system as @xmath82 where the sum is explictly restricted to exclude double occupancy of pair states .",
    "the wave - function @xmath83 is found by solving the many - body schrdinger equation for @xmath83 .",
    "richardson showed that the following ansatz works : @xmath84 here @xmath85 represents the sum over all permutations of @xmath86 , and the parameters @xmath87 are the solution of the coupled algebraic equations @xmath88 the total ground state energy is given by @xmath89    the discussion of richardson s exact solution in context with ultrasmall grains will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : results](a ) shows the ground state condensation energies for both even and odd grains calculated with g.c .",
    "bcs method , the pbcs approach ( for @xmath90 ) and richardson s exact solution .",
    "the result @xmath91 @xcite is also shown for comparison .",
    "the g.c .",
    "curves suggest the aforementioned `` breakdown of superconductivity '' @xcite at some critical @xmath55-dependent level spacing @xmath92 above which @xmath93 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath94 s ( i ) are significantly lower than the @xmath95 s , thus the projection much improves the variational ansatz ; and ( ii ) are negative for _ all _ @xmath4 , which shows that the system can _ always _ gain energy by allowing pairing correlations , even for arbitrarily large @xmath4 .",
    "the exact solution @xmath96 further improves the pbcs results , especially for intermediate level spacings .",
    "the pbcs results are evidently quite accurate for @xmath3 and , like the g.c . results , for @xmath97 .",
    "as anticipated in @xcite , the `` breakdown of superconductivity '' is evidently not as complete in the canonical as in the g.c .  case .",
    "nevertheless , some remnant of it does survive in @xmath98 , since its behaviour , too , changes markedly at a @xmath55 ( and @xmath22 ) dependent characteristic level spacing @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) : it marks the end of bulk bcs - like behavior for @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is _ extensive _ ( @xmath103 ) , and the start of a fluctuation - dominated  plateau for @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is practically _ intensive _ ( almost @xmath4 independent ) .",
    "the standard heuristic interpretation @xcite of the bulk bcs limit @xmath106 ( which is indeed reached by @xmath107 for @xmath108 ) hinges on the scale @xmath109 : the number of levels strongly affected by pairing is roughly @xmath110 ( those within @xmath109 of @xmath9 ) , with an average energy gain per level of @xmath111 . to analogously interpret the @xmath4 _ in_dependence of @xmath112 in the fluctuation - dominated regime",
    ", we argue that _ the scale @xmath109 loses its significance _",
    " fluctuations affect _ all _ @xmath113 unblocked levels within @xmath21 of @xmath9 ( this is made more precise below ) , and the energy gain per level is proportional to a renormalized coupling @xmath114 .",
    "the exact results smear out the crossover even more than the pbcs results ( @xmath115 lacks the kinks of @xmath116 ) , so much so that no sharply - defined crossover level spacing can be associated with @xmath117 .",
    "however , the crossover scale evidently still is @xmath118 .",
    "this can be confirmed by analyzing the functional dependence of the ground state energy on the coupling strength @xmath22 : in the bcs limit , @xmath119 , where @xmath2 depends exponentially on @xmath22 [ since @xmath120 . in the fluctuation - dominated regime , however , perturbation theory in @xmath22 suffices and the correlation energy is roughly linear in @xmath22 . for each @xmath4 , we thus fitted the numerical results for @xmath121 , calculated for various @xmath22 , to @xmath122 a `` phenomenological ansatz '' which intends to capture the relative importance of the exponential or linear @xmath22 dependence in the coefficients @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results](b ) , clearly show the crossover from the bcs - dominated regime ( @xmath125 ) to the fluctuation - dominated regime ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "next we analyze the ground state wave - function , which can be characterized by @xmath127 a set of correlators that measure the amplitude enhancement for finding a _ pair _ instead of two uncorrelated electrons in a single - particle niveau @xmath19 . for all @xmath30 of an uncorrelated state one",
    "has @xmath128 .",
    "for the g.c .  bcs case @xmath129 and the @xmath130 s have a characteristic peak of width @xmath131 around @xmath9 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : results](c ) , implying that pairing correlations are `` localized in energy space '' . for the bcs regime , both canonical methods produce @xmath130 s virtually identical to the g.c .  case , _ vividly illustrating why the g.c .",
    "bcs approximation is so successful : not performing the canonical projection hardly affects the parameters @xmath28 if @xmath73 , but tremendously simplifies their calculation_. however , in the fluctuation - dominated regime @xmath132 , the character of the wave - function changes : weight is shifted into the tails far from @xmath9 at the expense of the vicinity of the fermi energy . thus _ pairing correlations become delocalized in energy space _ ( as also found in @xcite ) , so that referring to them as mere `` fluctuations '' is quite appropriate .",
    "in the extreme case @xmath133 superconducting fluctuations are roughly equally strong for all interacting levels .",
    "the parity effect predicted in the g.c .",
    "ensemble can be studied with a simple generalization @xcite of the above methods .",
    "specifically , we shall study the parity - dependent `` pair - breaking energy '' @xmath134 , i.e. the minimum energy required to break a pair by flipping a spin in an even or odd grain , defined as @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the energy of the lowest - lying state with @xmath138 unpaired electrons with the same spin .",
    "( the pair - breaking energies can readily be measured in brt s experiments by applying a magnetic field , whose zeeman energy favors the breaking of pairs . ) for a non - interacting system and approximatly also for large @xmath3 , @xmath139 while @xmath140 . on the other hand , in the bulk limit @xmath141 , since in the bulk @xmath142 .",
    "the parity effect now states that as @xmath4 increases from @xmath143 , the pairing correlations die faster for an odd than an even grain , causing @xmath144 to initially decrease faster than @xmath145 . since in the large @xmath4-limit @xmath146",
    ", the two energies must cross somewhere at @xmath53 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results](d ) .",
    "this crossing is a manifestation of the parity effect already predicted in the g.c .",
    "framework .",
    "remarkably , despite the crudeness and incorrect treatment of fluctuations of the g.c .",
    "method , it gives surprisingly good results for energy differences like the @xmath134 .",
    "the fluctuations which it neglects seem to cancel substantially in energy differences such as @xmath134 .",
    "this observation _ a posteriori _ justifies the use of the g.c .",
    "method even for small grains , at least for rough calculations of energy differences .",
    "in summary , the crossover from the bulk to the fluctuation - dominated regime can be captured in full using a fixed-@xmath0 projected bcs ansatz , or even exactly using richardson s method . with increasing @xmath4 , the pairing correlations change from being strong and localized within @xmath2 of @xmath9 , to being mere weak , energetically delocalized `` fluctuations '' ; this causes the condensation energy to change from being _ extensive _ to _ intensive _ ( modulo small corrections ) .",
    "thus , the qualitative difference between `` superconductivity '' for @xmath147 , and `` fluctuations '' for @xmath148 , is that for the former but not the latter , adding _ more _ particles gives a _ different _ condensation energy ; for superconductivity , as anderson put it , `` more is different '' .",
