    "for a long time , it has been recognized that it is important to establish connections between apparently unrelated situations so that unifying pictures may emerge . in this context , the duality between the abelian maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) and self - dual ( sd ) theories in three dimensional spacetime found in  @xcite is a paradigmatic example .",
    "extensions of this relation involving non - abelian gauge fields were considered by various authors  @xcite . however , while the duality is well established for the free case , the situation becomes more subtle when interactions with others dynamical fields are taken into account .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite a master field action was used to show that the duality between the mcs and sd models coupled to fermions requires the addition of a thirring current - current interaction in the mcs lagrangian .",
    "however , problems were met in using the same method to study the duality when interactions with a bosonic field were present . in  @xcite , a so - called gauge embedding procedure was developed to overcome these problems . in this way",
    ", it became possible to build a theory dual to the sd model coupled to bosons or fermions .",
    "in the later case , this dual model turned out to be the mcs theory with a thirring interaction , as found in  @xcite , while in the former case a more complicated situation arose .",
    "indeed , the theory dual to the sd model coupled to bosons was found to be a modified mcs theory with an unusual field - dependent coefficient for the maxwell term .",
    "another interesting question concerns the realization of the duality for supersymmetric models .",
    "a first step in this direction was the use of the master field action approach in  @xcite to study the equivalence between the supersymmetric mcs and sd theories in the superfield formulation .",
    "however , using this method , it was not possible to go beyond the simplest case of abelian theories without any coupling to matter .",
    "our aim here is to propose a generalization of the gauge embedding method to construct a theory dual to the supersymmetric self - dual model interacting with a scalar superfield .",
    "we will show that this dual theory involves both a thirring interaction , as well as the modified mcs part .",
    "after building the duality at the classical level , we will show that it survives when the first order quantum corrections are taken into account .",
    "it is important to remind that this modified mcs lagrangian does not define a genuine gauge theory in the usual sense , since its action is invariant under a `` restricted '' gauge invariance , that is to say , when only the basic spinor superpotential undergoes a gauge transformation . as we shall see",
    ", it is very difficult to generalize the gauge embedding method in order to turn the dual of the sd model into a genuine gauge theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ freecase ] ,",
    "we review the duality between supersymmetric sd and mcs models , without coupling to dynamical sources , using the superfield formalism .",
    "afterwards , in section  [ gaugeembedding ] , we include the interaction of the sd with a matter superfield , and use the gauge embedding method to build the dual of this theory .",
    "the dual equivalence so obtained is shown to be maintained by the lowest - order quantum corrections in section  [ quantumduality ] . in section  [ completege ] , we describe the difficulties that arise when one tries to find a dual for the sd model which is a `` genuine '' gauge theory .",
    "our conclusions , together with some comments on the applicability of these methods to the noncommutative extensions of these models , are found in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our starting point is the superfield maxwell - chern - simons theory which is described by the action @xmath0    where @xmath1    is the usual superfield strength and @xmath2 is the spinor superpotential .",
    "hereafter , we follow the conventions of  @xcite . the action  ( [ mcs ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath3 . after the addition of the gauge - fixing term @xmath4    the propagator of the @xmath5 field takes the form @xmath6\\delta_{12},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    were @xmath7 . from eq .",

    "the propagator of the @xmath11 superfield is @xmath13\\delta_{12}.\\ ] ]    notice that the propagators for @xmath8 and @xmath11 both have a pole at @xmath14 . near this pole",
    "the @xmath11 propagator becomes @xmath15    where the dots stand for terms which stay finite as @xmath16 .",
    "thus the superfield @xmath11 of the supersymmetric self - dual model seems to play the same role as the superfield strength @xmath17 of the mcs theory .",
    "this conclusion is further substantiated by the equations of motion derived from the actions in  ( [ mcs ] ) and  ( [ sd ] ) ,    @xmath18    denoting the vector components of the superfields @xmath8 and @xmath11 respectively as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and    @xmath22    we find that the propagators for these fields in the neighborhood of the above mentioned pole coincide , @xmath23    we remind the reader that @xmath24 is the dual of the @xmath25 tensor , the field strength of the `` electromagnetic '' component field in @xmath2 .",
    "here we investigate the persistence of the duality pointed out in the previous section when interaction with matter is included .",
    "in this situation the approach developed in  @xcite , based on the use of the green functions for the field equations , can not be directly applied .",
    "in fact , the coupling of the gauge superfield to the ( scalar ) matter superfield can not be represented in the form @xmath26 because of the presence of an extra `` diamagnetic '' term characteristic of the minimal coupling . to circumvent this problem",

    "our aim consists in transforming the whole self - dual theory ( [ sdm ] ) into a gauge theory , in a sense to be clarified later .",
    "we start by recasting the pure matter sector of the action  ( [ sdm ] ) in the form , @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we used the notation @xmath32    the `` gauge '' current of the model differs from the above expression by a @xmath33 field dependent term , @xmath34    and the equations of motion for the gauge and scalar superfields are    @xmath35    here @xmath36 is the field - dependent `` mass '' of the @xmath11 superfield",

    "we therefore define the first - order iterated lagrangian @xmath43    the variation of @xmath44 under the transformations @xmath45 gives @xmath46    while the change in the euler vector @xmath47 is @xmath48    and , therefore , if we define @xmath49 , the variation @xmath50 turns out to be @xmath51    so that it can be canceled by the variation of the term @xmath52 . thus , the second - order iterated lagrangian @xmath53    is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath54 .",

    "( [ new ] ) as a dualized maxwell - chern - simons ( dmcs ) model .",
    "another point worth of noticing is the generation of a thirring interaction .",
    "we also remark that the gauge field interaction with the matter given by the term @xmath61 is the superfield analog of the `` magnetic '' coupling @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "let us now compare the equations of motion for the spinor superfield in the self - dual model  ( [ sdm ] ) and for the superfield strength in the dmcs model  ( [ new ] ) . after introducing the operator @xmath63    they",

    "it still remains to verify the equivalence for the matter sectors of these models . to this end",
    "we consider the equation of motion for the scalar superfield @xmath74 corresponding to the dmcs model , @xmath75    by using the expression  ( [ expw ] ) we arrive at @xmath76    which coincides with the equation of motion for the matter superfield in the sd model .",
    "this confirms the complete duality equivalence of these two models .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",

    "<S> , we construct the dual theory to the self - dual model interacting with a matter superfield , which turns out to be not the maxwell - chern - simons theory coupled to matter , but a more complicated model , with a `` restricted '' gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the difficulties in dualizing the self - dual field coupled to matter into a theory with complete gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> after that , we show that the duality , achieved between these two models at the tree level , also holds up to the lowest order quantum corrections . </S>"
