    "a new phase of matter called quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) is expected to be produced at high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the chiral symmetry may be restored in the new phase .",
    "it is usually claimed that chiral symmetry is restored , i.e. the chiral condensates vanish when the temperature @xmath1 of the system is higher than the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "however , this is true only when the system is always near the equilibrium",
    ". the effective potential may be chirally symmetric if @xmath3 .",
    "however , the condition @xmath4 does not necessarily guarantee the vanishing of chiral condensates in a time dependent process because of a finite relaxation time . in our previous work @xcite where friction is not taken into account",
    ", it was found that the maximum temperature must be high enough for the chiral condensates to vanish temporarily and furthermore the chiral condensates can not stay near the origin of the chiral space for a long time in general .",
    "the reason is as follows . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the time derivative of the chiral condensates becomes maximum at the bottom of the single - well potential if there is no friction .",
    "then , it is difficult for the condensates to stay near the minimum of the potential for a long time .",
    "this implies that the chiral symmetry does not restore for a long time even when @xmath1 becomes much higher than @xmath2 .",
    "it may , however , be possible that the condensates stay near the minimum of the potential if there is friction of sufficient magnitude@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the effect of the friction on the motion of the condensates in the chiral space . here , we consider that the vanishing or very small chiral condensates are the signal of the chiral symmetry restoration .    the chiral symmetry restoration is directly related to the interesting phenomena called disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc ) @xcite . in the conventional scenarios of dcc formation ,",
    "it is usually assumed that the condensates roll down to the minimum of the temperature dependent effective potential from the top of the hill of the potential . in such scenarios ,",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the chiral symmetry restoration takes place for a sufficiently long time .",
    "then , it is obvious that the investigation of the chiral symmetry restoration in a dynamical process is important also for studying dcc formation .    in this paper , we investigate whether the chiral condensates can stay near the origin of the chiral space for a long time when the equation of motion has a friction term using the linear @xmath0 model with the massless free particle approximation ( mfpa ) @xcite .",
    "the conditions of high energy heavy ion collisions are taken into account through an appropriate initial condition and a time dependent temperature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the equations of motion for the chiral condensates .",
    "various types of friction are introduced phenomenologically to study its role played in the chiral symmetry restoration in heavy ion collision processes .",
    "an expression for the entropy production due to the friction is derived . in section [ sec : numerical ] , the equations of motion are solved numerically for an adequate initial condition and a time dependent temperature .",
    "the time interval in which the chiral symmetry is restored approximately is studied in detail .",
    "entropy production is also studied .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",

    "\\label{eqn : temperature_dep_mass}\\ ] ]      as already mentioned in sec.[sec : intro ] , the aim of this paper is to investigate the friction effects on the chiral symmetry restoration in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the system which consists of the chiral condensates ( soft modes ) will be far from a ( local ) thermal equilibrium in such a time dependent process even when the environment which consists of the fluctuation fields ( hard modes ) is approximately in the ( local ) thermal equilibrium .",
    "in such a case , a friction term appears in general as a result of the dissipation - fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "thus we use a phenomenological equation of motion with a friction term : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 s are the friction coefficients . in general ,",
    "the friction coefficients depend on both @xmath1 and @xmath14 . in this paper , we assume that @xmath29 . for the functional form of @xmath30 which may provide either @xmath1 and/or @xmath14 dependence , we use the following form which was obtained for the chirally symmetric vacuum @xcite ( see also , @xcite ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the spence function and @xmath33 is the temperature dependent mass . in this paper",
    ", we consider the following four cases as the choice of @xmath30 :    case a : @xmath34 i.e. @xmath30 is taken for simplicity as a constant which is independent of both @xmath1 and @xmath14 @xcite case b : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pion mass at zero temperature .",
    "this choice may serve as a case in which @xmath30 has the simplest nontrivial @xmath1-dependence .",
    "this case may be realized in the rapid cooling case .",
    "case c : @xmath37 this is another case where @xmath30 has a simple @xmath1-dependence . in this case , we ignore the change of @xmath38 in the @xmath38- and @xmath1- dependent mass defined in eq.([eqn : temperature_dep_mass ] ) , i.e. , we take @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 in order that @xmath42 coincides with the pion mass at @xmath43 .",
    "case d : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the condensation value of the temperature dependent vacuum which is determined by the extremum condition @xmath46 in this case , the mass @xmath47 depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath45 while the latter is a function of @xmath1 .",
    "note that only case a has been considered by previous authors in numerical analyses @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the friction may be estimated from eq.([eqn : cof_expr ] ) for the symmetric phase .",
    "bir and greiner suggested that @xmath48 at @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "rischke calculated @xmath30 for the broken phase @xcite .",
    "it was also estimated by yabu et al .",
    "@xcite using the caldeira - legegett method .",
    "their result is @xmath50 in the uniform case . for the case",
    "a , we use @xmath51 as a typical value and consider also some other values for comparison . considering the theoretical ambiguity in the magnitude of @xmath30",
    ", we introduce the overall multiplicative constant @xmath52 for cases b , c and d. the friction coefficient @xmath30 in these three cases are replaced with @xmath53 with various @xmath52 in the following numerical calculations .",
    "we consider the time development of chiral condensates in the entire stage of heavy ion collisions at high energies .",
    "we concentrate on the central rapidity region where the temperature will become highest .",
    "a process which takes place in this region will be approximately invariant under the lorentz boost along the collision axis .",
    "then a convenient variable is the proper time @xmath54 .",
    "the condensates which are formed in the central region will evolve under the influence of the environment which consists of many number of partons ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) or hadrons . the effect may be represented by the temperature @xmath1 which depends on the proper time @xmath54 provided the environment is in the local thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we use the temperature as a convenient parameter even for the very early stage of the collision process where the environment may be far from the thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is because we do not know any other reliable method to describe the effect of the environment in the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "it is conceivable that hard collisions among the incident partons play a crucial role to thermalize the system in the beginning of the entire process .",
    "we then borrow the result of the parton cascade model @xcite in order to parameterize the @xmath54-dependence of @xmath1 for the early themalization stage including the very early stage of the collision .",
    "it is possible to estimate the @xmath54 - dependent temperature @xmath55 up to @xmath56 when the temperature reaches the maximum @xmath57 using the energy densities calculated in @xmath58 with the equation of state for the free quark - gluon gas .",
    "for example , one has @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 mev for au - au collisions at rhic and lhc energies , respectively .",
    "the proper time @xmath61 is typically some 1 fm . after this time",
    ", the system will expand mainly along the collision axis .",
    "the one - dimensional scaling hydrodynamics @xcite will be a good approximation for the cooling stage . then the temperature becomes a function of @xmath54 only , @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "to summarize , the temperature is parameterized as follows as a function of the scaled proper time @xmath64 for the entire stage of the collision @xcite : @xmath65    the temperature parameterized in eq.([eqn : temperature ] ) stays finite for a long time .",
    "however , the interactions between the environment and the condensates will vanish at a certain temperature called the freezeout temperature @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider that @xmath1 suddenly becomes zero when it reaches @xmath66 .",
    "then , the time dependence of the temperature may be parameterized as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 being the freezeout time . to summarize , the temperature decreases from @xmath57 down to @xmath66 and then suddenly becomes zero .",
    "it is supposed that the friction vanishes after @xmath70 because there will be no energy dissipation from the condensates into the thermal environment after the freezeout . in this situation , the initial condition of the quench scenario for the formation of dcc @xcite may be realized at @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "a whole process may exhibit a characteristic feature of the annealing scenario @xcite if @xmath66 is much lower than @xmath2 and if the one dimensional expansion lasts for a long time .",
    "equation of motion , eq.([eqn : biro_type ] ) , is now rewritten as @xmath72 \\phi_{i }   - h \\delta_{i,0 }   + \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{i}}{\\partial \\tau } = 0 , \\label{eqn:1dim_normal}\\ ] ] where we assume that the system is homogeneous along the transverse direction . in the next section , eq.([eqn:1dim_normal ] ) will be solved numerically with @xmath73 given by eq.([eqn : temperature ] ) or eq.([eqn : temperature_freezeout ] ) .",
    "consider the following equation of motion of a particle with mass @xmath33 in order to find the expression for the entropy production : @xmath74 where @xmath75 represents a conservative force and @xmath76 a non - conservative one .",

    "the @xmath1-dependence in the case d comes from the @xmath1-dependence of the pion mass .",
    "the pion mass is almost constant below @xmath2 and increases linearly above @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior of the pion mass below @xmath2 is similar to that in case b. the behavior above @xmath2 is asymptotically identical to that in case c. moreover , the magnitude of the friction is determined mainly by the factor @xmath93 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the friction in case d is quite similar to that in case b at low temperatures and it is similar to that in case c at high temperatures .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence of the friction in case d has a peak near the @xmath2 because of @xmath1-dependence of the pion mass .",

    "it is found that entropy is produced mainly in the early cooling stage .",

    ", we found the following results . in case",
    "a , the constant friction which has been used by some authors generates the largest @xmath121 among four cases .",

    "as stated in the introduction , the conventional scenarios of the formation of qgp and dcc in which the chiral symmetry is supposed to be restored for a sufficiently long time are not always guaranteed .",
    "our results suggests that it is important to estimate precisely the maximum temperature of the system and the friction for the soft mode .    in general scenarios of qgp evolution ,",
    "it is well - known that the entropy of the system is mostly produced in the thermalization stage ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "however , we found that the entropy due to the friction felt by the condensates is produced in the early stage of the cooling .",
    "as the initial condition of conventional dcc formation scenarios , it is often assumed that the roll - down of chiral condensates starts from the top of the potential ( chirally symmetric vacuum ) and the initial temperature is close to @xmath2",
    ". however , this initial condition may not be always satisfied as the chiral symmetry restoration does not necessarily occur even when the temperature of the system exceeds @xmath2 .    in our calculation",
    ", the condensation dependence of the friction is included in case d. however , it reflects essentially only the @xmath1-dependence of the vacuum .",
    "the effect of the time dependent condensates is not taken into account yet .",
    "such a dependence @xcite should be included to refine the analysis . on the other hand , random forces",
    "are not considered also in this paper because we are interested in the average behavior of the chiral condensate .",
    "they generate fluctuations in the motion of the condensate and hence in @xmath121 .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that the random force is strong when the friction is strong .",
    "however , the strong random force does not always affect considerably the motion of the condensate because its effect is reduced by the strong friction .",
    "even when the random force works , @xmath121 will become shorter on the average because condensate will occasionally be kicked out from the chirally symmetric region by the strong random force .",
    "this means that higher @xmath57 is required to realize the same @xmath121 on the average .",
    "there is another aspect in this situation .",
    "the condensate in the present case moves mainly along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "it is almost at rest along the @xmath139 axis . though the random force will decelerate or accelerate the condensate along the sigma direction",
    ", it will only accelerate the condensate along the @xmath139 direction . as a result ,",
    "the chiral symmetry will be more easily broken when the random force is included .",
    "finally , we would like to make a comment on the massless free particle approximation .",
    "it is not reliable at low temperature .",
    "the effects of mass and the finite volume of the colliding system have to be taken into account to improve the theory .",
    "however , we believe that our results are correct at least qualitatively . the problems listed above and their effects on dcc formation will be discussed in the coming paper .",

    "<S> it is found that ; ( i ) the maximum temperature must be high enough ( not lower than 230 mev ) and the friction must be strong enough in order that the chiral symmetry restoration lasts for a long time ( not shorter than 3fm / c ) ; ( ii ) the ratio of time interval in which chiral symmetry is restored , to the time interval in which the temperature is higher than the critical temperature is typically 0.5 when the friction is strong enough ; and ( iii ) the entropy due to the friction is mainly produced in the early stage of the cooling . </S>",
