    ", the locally observable quantities of the subsystem may be able to convey information about the global properties of the interacting system .",
    "while in general it is not always clear whether sufficient information about a possibly complex surounding system can be obtained from the few variables of the accessible subsystem , such an approach has proven to be suitable for probing the presence of correlations between the probe and its environment in a variety of situations @xcite . in the present article , we review recent progress in the local detection method @xcite  an interaction - assisted method , able to reveal quantum discord of the global system through the dynamics of a local subsystem .",
    "the method can be implemented when access is restricted to a controllable subsystem , and it has been tested in various different experimental settings . with the help of the examples reviewed in this article we discuss under which physical circumstances a successful local detection based on this method can generally be expected .",
    "the concept of quantum discord can be intuitively understood in terms of local measurements of a bipartite quantum system .",
    "measurements usually induce disturbances of the quantum system under observation @xcite . an exception to this textbook rule",

    "such a measurement projects the system into the eigenstate @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 , where we assume a non - degenerate observable with spectral decomposition @xmath5 .",

    "this family is comprised of all observables with the same eigenvectors as @xmath1 , assuming no degeneracies .",

    "this family is known as the states of zero discord .",
    "they can always be written as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a probability distribution and @xmath22 are density operators on system @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath3 form an orthonormal basis of @xmath23 since they are the eigenvectors of the hermitian operator @xmath19 .",
    "this distinguishes states of zero discord from separable states with the general form @xcite @xmath24 where the states @xmath25 are arbitrary and need neither be pure nor orthogonal .",
    "furthermore , unlike entanglement , discord is an asymmetric property , requiring specification of the system which is measured . throughout this article",
    "this will always be system @xmath15 .",
    "quantum discord therefore characterizes the presence or absence of a local observable which commutes with the full quantum state .",
    "nonzero discord can only be observed in correlated ( i.e. not factorizing ) quantum states , however , even some separable states exhibit discord . for pure states ,",
    "the concepts of discord and entanglement coincide .",
    "hence , in general , discord is a concept closely connected to correlations but does not itself measure correlations .",
    "in particular , a local operation on system @xmath15 may change the orthogonality properties of the @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.zerod ] ) @xcite and thereby create discord without creating correlations @xcite .",
    "the inability to commute with any local observable renders quantum states of nonzero discord furthermore suitable for certain technological tasks @xcite .",
    "for instance , a phase shift @xmath26 , imprinted by a local unitary transformation @xmath27 can be estimated with high precision @xcite only if the initial quantum state @xmath1 is strongly affected by this transformation @xcite .",
    "conversely , if @xmath28 happens to commute with @xmath1 , the state is completely invariant under this transformation and ,",
    "consequently , an estimation of the phase shift @xmath26 is impossible .",
    "while states of zero discord are insensitive to the action of certain local operators , this can be excluded for all states of nonzero discord , since no local operator commutes with these states @xcite .    among other applications @xcite , discord",
    "was further shown to be useful for the distribution @xcite and activation @xcite of entanglement . to exploit these phenomena experimentally , one needs to first find convenient ways to generate sufficiently robust discordant quantum states @xcite .",
    "second , methods to recognize the presence of discord , and perhaps to even quantify discord in experimentally relevant situations are required @xcite .",
    "the local detection method @xcite , to be introduced in the next section , is a dynamical method which allows to detect and quantify discord in a bipartite system with limited experimental requirements .",
    "the efficient detection of properties such as entanglement or discord is a challenging task @xcite , which usually requires measurements of correlated observables .",
    "a popular approach for low - dimensional systems is to first obtain full information about the quantum state , and then to calculate a suitable quantifier based on the measured entries of the density matrix @xcite . not only require the results of tomographic reconstructions of quantum states careful statistical analysis @xcite , their experimental realization soon becomes prohibitively expensive when high - dimensional or multipartite systems are of interest . in these cases , a complete characterization of the full quantum state",
    "can no longer be of interest .",
    "alternatively , the measurement of carefully designed observables ( such as entanglement witnesses ) may reveal the presence of entanglement @xcite or discord @xcite without knowledge of the full quantum state . yet",
    ", such procedures are often restricted to hilbert spaces of a certain dimension and structure ( e.g. qubit systems or two - mode systems of continuous variables ) , cf .",
    "their implementation furthermore often requires a high degree of control over the full quantum system ( or even multiple copies thereof @xcite ) which is difficult to achieve with increasing system size",
    ".    we may also encounter situations in which the experimenter may not even have full access to the complete quantum state of systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 but instead may be limited to measurements and operations on the subsystem @xmath15 .",
    "this limitation may be due to a fundamental inability to access the second system , when , for instance party @xmath16 is spatially separated from the experimenter at @xmath15 or describes degrees of freedom that can not be measured experimentally .",
    "it may also be a deliberate choice such as to restrict the dimension of the quantum system which is to be controlled . in either case one",
    "may consider the subsystem @xmath16 an ancilla system or environment to system @xmath15 .",
    "since the reduced dynamics of system @xmath15 may be strongly influenced by correlations with system @xmath16 , a dynamical witness for discord may be observable , even by restricting to local measurements of system @xmath15 .      to introduce the basic idea of the local detection method @xcite",
    "let us recall that states of zero discord are characterized by their invariance under non - selective measurements , i.e. , a state @xmath1 has zero discord if and only if there exists a complete set of one - dimensional orthogonal projectors @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 this operation  ( [ eq.arbdephasing ] ) is a purely local operation on system @xmath15 and its implementation does not require any knowledge of system @xmath16 .",
    "it furthermore describes complete dephasing in the basis @xmath32 and is therefore called a _ local dephasing operation _",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us assume the state @xmath1 has zero discord .",
    "a local dephasing operation that leaves the state invariant thus exists , but in which particular local basis @xmath32 ?",
    "let us first express the full quantum state @xmath1 in terms of families of completely arbitrary local operator bases as @xmath33 . to answer the above question , we study the reduced density matrix of system @xmath15 , which is obtained by performing the partial trace over @xmath16 , after the dephasing operation . we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the invariance property @xmath36 shows that the basis @xmath32 under which a local dephasing operation has no effect on the total quantum state must coincide with the eigenbasis of the reduced density matrix @xmath18 @xcite . for now",
    ", we do not consider the case of degeneracies , which may complicate the situation @xcite .",
    "hence , one may test for the presence of discord by realizing a local dephasing operation in the eigenbasis of @xmath18 . the full quantum state is invariant under this operation if and only if it contains no discord .",
    "however , a possible change of the full quantum state under the local dephasing operation can not be directly observed in system @xmath15 : even if the state contains discord , i.e. , it changes under the local dephasing , the resulting reduced density matrix @xmath37 with @xmath38 will always coincide with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by realizing that the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq.redstateafterdeph ] ) was derived without making any assumption about the full quantum state @xmath1 .",
    "we will therefore always observe that @xmath39 , regardless of whether @xmath40 holds or not .",
    "moreover , since the local dephasing operation does not act on system @xmath16 , one further finds that also @xmath41 must always hold @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can conclude that if any difference between the original state @xmath1 and the locally dephased reference state @xmath42 exists , it must be contained in the correlations between the two subsystems  their respective local descriptions are always unchanged by the local dephasing .",
    "does this mean that it is impossible to observe @xmath43 ( which would constitute a witness for discord ) by purely local measurements of any of the two systems ?",
    "a solution can be found by considering the dynamics of this bipartite system .",
    "in fact , a change of the correlation properties of the initial state can have a strong observable impact on the reduced dynamics of one of the subsystems .",
    "this is especially well known in the theory of open quantum systems @xcite , where the influence of initial system - environment correlations poses a considerable theoretical challenge @xcite . here , however , it can be exploited to reveal a change of the correlations between the subsystems to the local dynamics .",
    "thus , even if @xmath1 and @xmath42 are indistinguishable to measurements of system @xmath15 at some initial time @xmath44 , they may become locally distinguishable after the two systems have been interacting for a time @xmath45 .",
    "let us assume that systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 are subject to some interaction . for simplicity , we consider a unitary evolution of the composite system , such that the evolution in subsystem @xmath15 , given the initial state @xmath1 ,",
    "is governed by @xmath46 if the state @xmath1 was subject to local dephasing before the time evolution , the state of system @xmath15 at time @xmath47 instead reads @xmath48 we had already noted that @xmath49 , regardless of the properties of @xmath1 .",
    "however , if we observe @xmath50 at a later time @xmath45 we can safely conclude that @xmath43 which implies the presence of discord in the state @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "all of the necessary steps , i.e. ,    * finding the eigenbasis of @xmath18 * observing the time evolution of @xmath51 * local dephasing of the initial state in the eigenbasis of @xmath18 * observing the time evolution of @xmath52    can be carried out with strictly local access only to system @xmath15 , whereas no control or even knowledge of system @xmath16 is required .",
    "the local detection protocol is illustrated in the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.localdetectionprotocol ]",
    ".     produces a reference state @xmath42 , which differs from the original state @xmath1 only in lacking discord .",
    "the reduced dynamics of the accessible system @xmath15 can be strongly influenced by the removal of discord .",
    "hence , at a later time @xmath47 , the system may evolve differently when the initial state @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath53 is indeed observed , it represents a witness for discord of @xmath1 and the distance among the local states further serves as a quantitative measure of discord .",
    "adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "detecting the mere presence of discord by following the protocol outlined above does not provide any quantitative information about the discord of the state @xmath1 . considering that discord is a rather ubiquitous phenomenon @xcite , it is also relevant to estimate how strongly discordant a given initial state is .",
    "certain quantifiers furthermore allow for an operational interpretation and therefore directly quantify how well a certain quantum information task can be carried out @xcite .    a straight - forward way to quantify discord emerges from the local dephasing operation . from the discussion above , we know that @xmath42 differs from @xmath1 if and only if @xmath1 contains discord . a simple quantifier of discord is thus given by the _ dephasing disturbance _",
    "@xcite , expressed by the trace distance @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the trace distance has several appealing properties , most notably for our purposes is its contractivity under trace - preserving and positive operations @xcite .",
    "the unitary time evolution and the partial trace operation are both positive operations ( they map positive operators , such as the density operator , to positive operators ) @xcite .",
    "thus , using the contractivity property we find that the locally observable distance between the reduced density matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 provides a lower bound for the dephasing disturbance @xcite : @xmath56 the above inequality holds for all @xmath57 , hence one may optimize the locally accessible lower bound by observing the time evolution of the local system for as long as possible and then taking the maximum distance @xcite @xmath58    the above definition assumes that the local dephasing operation is unique , which requires that the eigenbasis of @xmath18 is unambiguous .",
    "this , however , is not the case if degeneracies are present in the spectrum of @xmath18 . in these cases",
    "the dephasing disturbance does not produce a suitable quantifier of discord @xcite .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by including a minimization over all possible dephasing bases .",
    "recalling the @xmath32-dependent definition  ( [ eq.arbdephasing ] ) of a general dephasing operation , we introduce the _ minimal dephasing disturbance _ @xcite @xmath59 this measure in fact quantifies the maximal amount of entanglement which can be activated from discord in a measurement ( _ minimal entanglement potential _ ) @xcite when the accessible subsystem is a qubit , i.e.,@xmath60 .",
    "a locally accessible bound for the _ minimal dephasing disturbance _ can be obtained by dephasing over different local bases instead of just the eigenbasis of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we introduce @xmath61 and the corresponding local trace distance @xmath62 a more rigorous bound for discord than eq .",
    "( [ eq.localmaxdist ] ) is then obtained as @xcite @xmath63 to measure the above quantity , one first records the time evolution of @xmath64 for different dephasing bases @xmath32 . at each time @xmath47 ,",
    "the minimum of all @xmath65 is obtained , the minimum being taken over all @xmath32 .",
    "then , within the set of minima one finds the maximum value over all times @xmath47 to obtain the strongest available local witness .",
    "ideally , the optimization over @xmath32 should be carried out over all possible bases , which is experimentally impossible . in a realistic situation",
    "a systematic sampling over a sufficiently closely spaced grid of basis vectors can yield a good estimate with reasonable overhead , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "let us consider the simple case of a pure state with a controllable qubit subspace , @xmath60 . as mentioned before , the concept of discord reduces for pure states to entanglement  in the absence of classical mixing , this is the only form of correlation that can be present . in this case ,",
    "the dephasing disturbance  ( [ eq.dephasingdisturbance ] ) can be evaluated analytically and yields @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the _ negativity _",
    "@xcite , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the partial transpose of @xmath1 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the minimal dephasing disturbance  ( [ eq.mindephdist ] ) coincides with the minimal entanglement potential , which for pure states also reduces to the negativity @xcite .",
    "hence , in the above scenario , the dephasing disturbance coincides  ( [ eq.dephasingdisturbance ] ) with the minimal dephasing disturbance  ( [ eq.mindephdist ] ) , and the minimum is achieved by dephasing in the eigenbasis of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the local distance  ( [ eq.localmaxdist ] ) yields a locally accessible lower bound for the negativity .",
    "discord can ultimately be traced back to those two - body coherences that are present in @xmath1 but are no longer found in @xmath42 , i.e. , after local dephasing .",
    "those coherences are not detectable in either of the two subsystems .",
    "therefore , the performance of the local detection method depends crucially on the interacting dynamics between the two subsystems .",
    "its role is to map these initially hidden two - body coherences to measurable elements of the reduced density matrix of system @xmath15 at a later time .",
    "certainly some dynamical processes will work better than others in detecting these correlations .",
    "for instance , if no interaction between the two systems were present , i.e. , @xmath70 , this task could never be achieved @xcite .",
    "in the course of this article we will observe a number of different time evolutions and thereby explore the limitations of the local detection method based on these examples .",
    "let us already mention that early estimates for the efficacy of the method have been obtained based on a formulation in terms of the hilbert - schmidt distance , which allows for analytical evaluation of measure - theoretic averages over the unitary group @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xcite @xmath71 with the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 being the dimensions of the hilbert spaces @xmath23 and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath75 representing the haar measure on the unitary group .",
    "these group - theoretic methods further allow for analytical evaluation of the variance corresponding to the above average @xcite , as well as time - dependent averages with respect to more realistic random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "these results show that the locally observable signal , obtained from a generic dynamical system , is directly proportional to the discord of the initial state .",
    "hence a generic unitary evolution is expected to reveal the quantum discord based on the local detection method . for further details on the haar - measure integration techniques and additional numerical and analytical studies of the local detection method in this context",
    ", we refer to refs .",
    "note , however , that the hilbert - schmidt distance is not contractive under positive maps .",
    "this can lead to unphysical behavior of hilbert - schmidt based quantifiers for discord and related quantities @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it is generally recommended to use the trace distance instead @xcite .",
    "we also observe that the proportionality factor on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq.haarmeasureaverage ] ) shrinks to zero as @xmath74 increases .",
    "this might suggest the conclusion that the signal becomes undetectably small when the observable system is coupled to a truly infinite environment .",
    "the result  ( [ eq.haarmeasureaverage ] ) however makes statements about generic evolutions which are well represented by the average over all unitaries . generally speaking , systems that lead to such a dynamics are typically strongly chaotic , and deviations from the average result  ( [ eq.haarmeasureaverage ] ) are certainly expected . in common situations",
    "one might as well encounter highly non - generic evolutions , in particular in quantum optical systems . later in this article",
    "we will discuss a successful experimental detection of system - environment discord by means of the local detection method where the accessible system couples to an infinite - dimensional , markovian ( memoryless ) environment @xcite .",
    "the local detection method has been used to reveal discord in experiments with photons @xcite and trapped ions @xcite . in all experimental applications",
    "reported so far , the controllable subspace was two - dimensional , whereas correlations were detected with ancilla systems ranging from two - dimensional systems to continuous variables .",
    "an experimental realization of the local detection method was first reported in  @xcite .",
    "a single trapped ion is used to simulate both a two - dimensional , locally accessible quantum system by means of its electronic degree of freedom , and a bosonic ancilla system , comprised of the same ion s motional degree of freedom .",
    "since the ion is confined in a harmonic trapping potential , the ancilla system is described by a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "when the ion is driven by a laser whose detuning from the ion s resonance transition coincides with the frequency of the harmonic motion , an interaction between the two degrees of freedom , described to a good approximation by the anti - jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath76 is evoked @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the harmonic oscillator mode , @xmath79 , @xmath80 denote the ladder operators for the electronic qubit system , @xmath81 denotes the rabi frequency and @xmath82 is the lamb - dicke parameter @xcite . in the above expression we assumed , for ease of notation , the lamb - dicke regime ,",

    "<S> quantum discord in a bipartite system can be dynamically revealed and quantified through purely local operations on one of the two subsystems . to achieve this , the local detection method harnesses the influence of initial correlations on the reduced dynamics of an interacting bipartite system . </S>",
    "<S> this article s aim is to provide an accessible introduction to this method and to review recent theoretical and experimental progress . </S>"
