    "super dense coding is one of the notable areas in which quantum entanglement plays a crucial role . by this protocol , due to the nonlocal properties of quantum entanglement",
    ", it is possible to communicate two bits of classical information by sending one qubit only @xcite . the first attention , after proposing the super dense coding protocol , was given to various scenarios over noiseless channels and unitary encoding @xcite .",
    "in this case one starts from a @xmath0-dimensional bipartite shared state @xmath1 between the sender alice and the receiver bob .",
    "alice performs with probability @xmath2 a local unitary operation @xmath3 on her subsystem to encode classical information through the state @xmath4 subsequently , she sends her subsystem to bob ( ideally via a noiseless channel ) .",
    "the ensemble that bob receives is @xmath5 .",
    "the maximal amount of classical information that can reliably be transmitted in this process is known as super dense coding capacity .",
    "it has been shown that for noiseless channels and unitary encoding , the capacity is given by @xmath6 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath7 is bob s reduced density operator with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the von neumann entropy . without the additional resource of entangled states",
    ", a @xmath10-dimensional quantum state can be used to transmit the information @xmath11 .",
    "hence , quantum states for which @xmath12 , i.e. , those which are more mixed locally than globally , are the useful states for super dense coding .",
    "a realistic quantum system usually suffers from unwanted interactions with the outside world .",
    "optical fibers and an unmodulated spin chain @xcite are examples of such quantum channels which are suitable for long- and short - distance quantum communication , respectively",
    ". super dense coding in the situation when the quantum states experience noise in the transmission channels was studied in @xcite . in @xcite uncorrelated noise ( i.e. , memoryless channels )",
    "was discussed . for those cases ( channels and states ) where the von neumann entropy fulfills a specific condition ,",
    "the super dense coding capacity was derived .",
    "explicitly , for the two - dimensional uncorrelated depolarizing channel , it was shown that alice and bob do not win by sending classical information via a super dense coding protocol with unitary encoding if there is too much noise .    in this paper , memory effects along the transmission channel",
    "are taken into account . in this scenario",
    "the noisy channel acting on two subsystems can not be expressed as a product of two independent channels acting on each subsystem separately . in particular , we investigate the bipartite super dense coding scenario for a _ correlated _ pauli channel and unitary or non - unitary encoding .",
    "such kinds of channels were originally analyzed from the point of view of optimization of the classical information transmission @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ 1 - 1 - 0 ] we review the holevo bound as a key concept in finding the super dense coding capacity . we discuss the mathematical definition of the holevo quantity in the presence of an arbitrary channel @xmath13 . section [ 1 - 3 ] is devoted to the super dense coding capacity in the presence of a correlated pauli channel and unitary encoding .",
    "we give examples of correlated channels and initial states for which the capacity is explicitly determined .",
    "section [ non - unitary encoding ] is dedicated to the correlated pauli channel and non - unitary encoding .",
    "we compare the capacities related to both unitary and non - unitary encoding and also discuss a case where non - unitary encoding has an advantage over unitary encoding . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conc ] , we summarize the main results .",
    "the performance of a given composite state @xmath1 for super dense coding is usually quantified by the holevo quantity , maximized over all possible encodings on alice s side . a theorem stated by gordon @xcite and levitin @xcite , and proved by holevo @xcite , states that the amount of accessible classical information ( @xmath14 ) contained in an ensemble @xmath15 is upper bounded by the so - called @xmath16-quantity @xmath17 , often also referred to as the holevo quantity .",
    "this upper bound holds for any measurement that can be performed on the system , and is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the average ensemble state and @xmath20 is the von neumann entropy of @xmath21 . from the concavity of the von neumann entropy",
    "@xmath22 it follows that the holevo quantity is non - negative .",
    "the holevo bound ( [ chi - quantity1 ] ) is achievable in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "a quantum channel is a communication channel which can transmit quantum information .",
    "physically , a noisy quantum channel is a communication channel that is affected by interaction with the environment .",
    "mathematically , a noisy quantum channel can be described as a completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map acting on the quantum state that is transmitted .",
    "we consider @xmath23 to be a cptp map that acts on the encoded state @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    "being the ensemble that bob receives , the holevo quantity is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average state after transmission through the noisy channel and @xmath28 is the relative entropy .",
    "the super dense coding capacity @xmath29 for a given resource state @xmath1 and the noisy channel @xmath13 is defined to be the maximum of the holevo quantity @xmath30 with respect to the unitary operators @xmath3 , chosen with the probabilities @xmath2 , namely @xmath31 in the following , we will concentrate on the optimization of the holevo quantity in order to find the super dense coding capacity .",
    "we will now consider quantum channels with memory , where noise in consecutive uses of the channel is correlated .",
    "we specifically consider correlated pauli channels @xcite , modelled as follows .",
    "consider first a single pauli channel , whose action on a @xmath10-dimensional density operator @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 are probabilities ( i.e. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . the unitary _ displacement _ operators @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38 the above operators satisfy @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and commute up to a phase , @xmath41 as the operators @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ pauli - d - channel ] ) are unitary , the pauli channel is unital , i.e. , it preserves the identity .",
    "now , let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be two @xmath10-dimensional pauli channels ( [ pauli - d - channel ] ) with the elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . based on the elements of these two channels , a model of a correlated pauli channel",
    "is defined as @xmath46 where the probability @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 , and the parameter @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) quantifies the correlation degree . for @xmath51 the two channels @xmath42 and @xmath43 are uncorrelated and act independently on alice s and bob s subsystems , respectively . for @xmath52 , the global channel ( [ k - pauli - channels ] ) is called _ fully correlated _ and for other values of @xmath49 , different from _ zero _ and _ one _ , the global channel is partially correlated .    for a single sender , a single receiver , and a correlated pauli channel as well as unitary and non - unitary encoding , we derive two explicit expressions for the super dense coding capacity .",
    "we show that both unitary and non - unitary encoding problems reduce to the problem of finding a single cptp map ( in the case of unitary encoding this is a specific unitary transformation ) that minimizes the output von neumann entropy after its application and the action of the channel on the input state @xmath1 . for the case of unitary encoding",
    "we find examples for the optimal unitary operator .",
    "this subsection treats the optimization of the holevo quantity for a correlated pauli channel and unitary encoding .",

    "we also found an explicit example of non - unitary pre - processing @xmath139 which can improve the super dense coding capacity , in comparison to only unitary encoding , for a range of the correlation degree of the channel .",
    "we also provided an example for which no better encoding than unitary encoding is possible . therefore , based on the current results , the usefulness of non - unitary pre - processing in super dense coding depends on the quantum channel ( e.g. its type , its noise parameter and correlation degree ) and the resource state .    1 - 10 c. h. bennett and s. j. wiesner , phys .",
