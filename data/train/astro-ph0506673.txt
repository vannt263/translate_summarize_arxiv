    "4c+74.26  ( @xmath9 ; @xcite ) is a luminous broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) most notable for its large radio lobes , extending 10 arcminutes ( tip - to - tip ) on the sky @xcite .",
    "a one - sided jet has been observed with the vla @xcite and on pc scales with vlbi @xcite .",
    "the flux limit on a counterjet gives a limit to the inclination angle of @xmath10  degrees @xcite , resulting in a physical size for the radio source of @xmath11  mpc ( using a @xmath12 cosmology : @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; @xcite ) , well within the range to be classified as a giant radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "the observed morphology of the radio jets clearly places it as a frii source , although the radio luminosity of 4c+74.26is on the border between fri and frii @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity has been estimated to be @xmath17  ergs  s@xmath14 @xcite , indicating that 4c+74.26  is also close to the seyfert - quasar border .",
    "the host galaxy has a size and luminosity typical of other giant ellipticals associated with radio sources @xcite .",
    "optical spectra reveal very broad permitted lines with measurements of the h@xmath18 fwhm ranging from @xmath19  km  s@xmath14 @xcite to 11,000  km  s@xmath14 @xcite . using this last value , @xcite",
    "employ the broad - line region radius - luminosity relation @xcite to obtain a black hole mass of @xmath20  m@xmath21 .",
    "x - ray observations of 4c+74.26  began with a 23  ks _ asca _ observation in 1996 .",
    "@xcite presented the first analysis of these data , as well as _",
    "the data from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey yielded a very hard photon - index for the 0.32  kev  band , @xmath22 , with a cold absorption column slightly above the galactic value of @xmath23  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "_ rosat _ pspc data of 4c+74.26  was available from a 20  ks observation of the cataclysmic variable vw cep during which the blrg was in the field - of - view .",
    "an absorbed power - law fit to this dataset by @xcite also revealed a hard power - law ( @xmath24 ) with higher than galactic absorption .",
    "a later analysis of this pspc data by @xcite found that a dusty warm absorber model provided a good fit and increased the photon - index to values closer to those found in the _ asca _ data ( @xmath25 ) and in _ rosat _ samples of radio - loud quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the _ asca _ data has subsequently been re - analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all groups found a best fit model that included a power - law with a photon index @xmath25 and cold absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "however , @xcite preferred a solution with a warm absorber , while the best fit of @xcite did not require one ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite find a gaussian fe  k@xmath7  line at the 97 per cent confidence level , but @xcite find one about twice as strong and at @xmath27 per cent confidence .",
    "the _ asca _ data also show a hardening at high energies , which @xcite and @xcite model with a reflection continuum , but find very high reflection fractions ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively ) .",
    "@xcite argue that such a large reflection fraction should yield a much stronger fe  k@xmath7  line , and propose a model where the hardening is due to a second , very hard power - law with @xmath30 , possibly arising from the radio jet .",
    "this confusing situation was improved by a 100  ks _ bepposax _ observation presented by @xcite .",
    "no significant variability was detected from 4c+74.26  even in the high - energy pds band .",
    "this fact provides strong evidence that jet emission is not significantly contributing to the hard x - rays .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that compton reflection provides the best fit to their broadband data with @xmath31 .",
    "these authors also find cold absorption in excess of the galactic value , but a warm absorber is not required by the data .",
    "a significant , but unresolved , fe  k@xmath7  line was also detected in the _ bepposax _ spectrum .",
    "more recently , very preliminary results from a 70  ks _ chandra _ gratings observation of 4c+74.26  have been presented by @xcite . a highly ionized and weak warm absorber",
    "was detected by _",
    ", including emission and absorption lines from h - like and he - like mg , al and si . moreover , the low number of counts at energies less than 0.8  kev  could indicate o  vii  and o  viii  edges ( kaspi , private communication ) .    here ,",
    "we present the results of a 35  ks _ xmm - newton _  observation of 4c+74.26which will for the first time properly characterize the x - ray spectrum of this source .",
    "the detection of a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath7line has already been reported elsewhere ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "this paper therefore concentrates on the timing analysis ( sect .",
    "[ sect : timing ] ) and fitting the broadband spectrum ( sect .  [ sect : spectral ] ) .",
    "the paper concludes by discussing the results in sect .",
    "[ sect : discuss ] .",
    "we begin in the next section by describing the details of the observation and data reduction .",
    "4c+74.26  was observed by _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite for 35  ks during revolution 762 starting at 2004 february 6 13:57:42 .",
    "data were collected using the single pn @xcite and two mos @xcite detectors in the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) system , both reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ; @xcite ) and the optical monitor ( om ; @xcite ) .",
    "the epic instruments were operated in large - window mode with the medium optical filter in place .",
    "the rgs was operated in standard spectroscopy mode .",
    "data reduction was performed using the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas ) v.6.1 .",
    "the analysis chains epchain and emchain were run on the observation data files to produce calibrated event lists for the mos and pn detectors by removing bad pixels and applying both gain and charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) corrections to the data .",
    "source spectra were extracted using circles of radius 115 arcseconds ( for the pn ) , 119 arcseconds ( mos1 ) and 122 arcseconds ( mos2 ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted from source free areas on the same ccd using circles with radii of 60 arcseconds ( pn and mos1 ) and 50 arcseconds ( mos2 ) .",
    "the extracted pn spectrum included both single and double events , while the mos spectra were comprised of events with all patterns .",
    "the background was negligible during the observation except for a minor enhancement at @xmath32  ks into the integration .",
    "a good - time interval file was constructed as described in   4.4.3 of the _ xmm - newton _  sas user s",
    "guide to remove any potential contamination by background events .",
    "the sas task epatplot was used to check the pattern distributions in the epic data , and both mos spectra were found to suffer from a non - negligible amount of pileup @xcite . to correct this ,",
    "the mos spectra were re - extracted using only single ( i.e. , pattern 0 ) events .",
    "following background subtraction , the final pn spectrum has 28.8  ks of good exposure time and consists of over @xmath33 counts , giving a mean count rate of 8.6  s@xmath14 .",
    "the final background subtracted mos-1 and mos-2 spectra each had mean count rates of 2.2  s@xmath14 , and contained @xmath34 and @xmath35 counts , respectively .",
    "prior to spectral analysis , all data were grouped using grppha to have a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "finally , the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen were utilized to produce the response matrix and ancillary response files .",
    "we note that the background extraction regions used above are smaller than the source extraction regions .",
    "this was done in order that the background was taken from either the same ccd or same window as the majority of the source counts . to check the spectral analysis described in the following section ,",
    "larger background regions from a different ccd with radii equal to or larger than the source regions were also extracted .",
    "the derived spectral parameters were not significantly changed by using the larger background regions , therefore we report the results from the original data extraction .    the rgs data were reduced using the rgsproc chain in the sas .",
    "the observed count rate was 0.15  s@xmath14 for rgs1 and 0.19  s@xmath14 for rgs2 .",
    "this yielded only @xmath36 and @xmath37 counts in the rgs1 and rgs2 spectra , respectively .",
    "given the small number of counts it was decided not to pursue a detailed analysis of the rgs spectra , although the continua predicted by the broadband pn models ( including the warm absorption edges ) were checked against the observed rgs spectral shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the 0.210  kev  pn lightcurve of 4c+74.26  in 100  s time bins .",
    "the sas task lccorr was used to background subtract the data , as well as provide corrections for vignetting and deadtime .    as with the earlier _ asca _ @xcite and _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite observations , no significant variability was observed from 4c+74.26",
    ". a constant fit to the pn lightcurve resulted in a @xmath38d.o.f.@xmath39 ( d.o.f.=degrees of freedom ) , with a best fit of 8.57  s@xmath14 .",
    "in this section we present the results of fitting the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of 4c+74.26  between 0.3 and 12  kev  in the observed frame . since it has the largest number of counts and higher spectral resolution , the pn spectrum was initially analyzed on its own , but we include the mos data ( from 0.310  kev ) at the end of this section to check for any differences . as mentioned above , results for the fe  k@xmath7  line region and reflection parameters are presented in paper i. here , we will concentrate on the absorption characteristics in the observed spectrum .",
    "xspec v.11.3.1p @xcite was used for the spectral fitting , and a @xmath40 criterion was used to determine the 2@xmath41 errorbars on the best - fit parameters .",
    "galactic absorption , modeled using the tbabs code in xspec @xcite , is included in all fits .",
    "unless stated otherwise , the figures are plotted in the observed frame , while the fit parameters are quoted in the rest frame .",
    "we begin the analysis with the best - fitting model found in fitting the 212  kev  data .",
    "this model , denoted iondisk*blr+iondisk+g in paper i , consists of a relativistically blurred ionized disk ( employing the models of @xcite ) , an unblurred neutral reflector ( also using the @xcite models ) , and a narrow gaussian emission line .",
    "the data - to - model ratio when the 0.32  kev  data are included is shown in figure  [ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the plot clearly shows that a significant amount of absorption is required at energies @xmath42  kev .",
    "this opacity could be in the form of extra cold absorption ( as favored by the earlier analyses of @xcite and @xcite ) , warm absorption ( as indicated by @xcite ) , or a combination of the two .    to test the different absorption models",
    ", we first froze the parameters in the model related to the fe  k@xmath7  lines , and then added additional intrinsic absorption via the ztbabs model in xspec . a good fit",
    "was found ( @xmath38d.o.f.=1643/1643 ) to the 0.312  kevspectrum with an intrinsic column @xmath43  @xmath1 . when the cold absorption model was replaced with the warm absorber model absori @xcite ,",
    "the ionization parameter of the absorber went to zero and basically the same fit was uncovered as before ( @xmath38d.o.f.=1638/1642 ) .",
    "however , the _ chandra _ data of 4c+74.26  show evidence for a weak warm absorber with possible ionized oxygen edges . to check this , an o  viii  edge at 0.87  kev  and an o  vii  edge at 0.739",
    "kev  were added to the cold absorption model above .",
    "this new model resulted in a significant ( @xmath44 with only 2 additional degrees of freedom ) improvement over the purely cold absorber case , bolstering the case for a warm absorber toward 4c+74.26 .",
    "since the previous model excluding the warm absorber resulted in a statistically acceptable fit , it is not possible to conclude that the data require warm absorption .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in the first line of table  [ table : fit1 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ notes _ : @xmath45 parameter fixed at value    there is strong evidence for an o  vii  edge in the data with a maximum optical depth of @xmath46@xmath47 , consistent with the limit from the _ asca _ data .",
    "a further improvement to the fit was made when the fe  k@xmath7  line parameters were allowed to vary ( second line in table  [ table : fit1 ] ) . except for @xmath48 , the absorption parameters did not change significantly .",
    "the residuals to this last fit ( our best - fit model ) are shown in figure  [ fig : ratio2 ] , while the model is displayed in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the residuals show no evidence for a soft excess .",
    "the neutral reflector predicts soft x - ray emission lines from o  vii  and o  viiithat do seem to be accounted for in the data .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain a long gratings observation with either _ xmm - newton _  or _",
    "chandra _ to confirm this possibility .",
    "the above fits give strong indications that a warm absorber is present in 4c+74.26 , but unfortunately can not give much further information . in order to try to further characterize the warm absorber",
    ", we performed a fit where we replaced the absorption edges with the absori model ( the extra cold absorption was still included in the model ) . to simplify the procedure ,",
    "the fit was performed with the fe  k@xmath7  line parameters frozen as in the first line of table  [ table : fit1 ] .",
    "the fit assumed solar abundances and an absorber temperature of @xmath49  k ( higher temperatures did not improve the results ) .",
    "a good fit was obtained ( @xmath38d.o.f.=1616/1641 ) with a warm absorber column of @xmath50  @xmath1 and an ionization parameter of 56@xmath51 .",
    "the intrinsic cold absorption column remained at @xmath52  @xmath1 .",
    "while this parameterization is clearly inferior compared to a gratings analysis , it is consistent with kaspi s early inferences of the warm absorber in 4c+74.26 .    using the best - fit model from table  [",
    "table : fit1 ] , we find a 0.52  kev  flux of @xmath53  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath14  and a 0.510  kev  flux of @xmath54  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath14 .",
    "the total unabsorbed luminosity between 0.5 and 2 ( 10 )  kev  is @xmath55 ( @xmath56 )  ergs  s@xmath14 . employing the black hole mass estimate of @xmath20  m@xmath21 @xcite , and assuming that the x - ray luminosity is @xmath57 per cent of the bolometric luminosity , then 4c+74.26  has an eddington ratio of @xmath58 .    as a final check on the results , mos data between 0.3 and 10",
    "kevwere added and joint pn - mos spectral fits were performed .",
    "the normalizations of the mos spectra were allowed to float relative to the pn spectrum to account for any slight calibration errors . also , a separate photon - index was fit to the mos data , as it is known that mos spectra are slightly harder than ones observed from the pn @xcite .",
    "the joint pn - mos fits resulted in a slightly steeper @xmath59 than previously found , and consequently more absorption in the edges and intrinsic cold absorber was required .",
    "the parameter values from our best fit model are shown in the last line in table  [ table : fit1 ] .",
    "one can see there is only minor changes in the fit parameters .",
    "when the absori model was used , the warm absorber column reduced to @xmath60  @xmath1 , and the ionization parameter also fell to @xmath61 .",
    "both these values are well within the errorbars of the previous ones found using only the pn data .",
    "paper i presented evidence for a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath7  in the 212  kev  spectrum of 4c+74.26 .",
    "the broad line was the statistically preferred fit , but as seen in other agn @xcite the breadth of the fe  k@xmath7  may also be explained by a complicated absorption model . in this section",
    "we test if complex absorption models can provide a better fit to the broadband data than one involving a broad fe  k@xmath7  line .",
    "the pn data are employed between 0.312  kev  to make use of its superior sensitivity at 6  kev .",
    "in contrast to ngc  3783 @xcite and ngc  3516 @xcite , 4c+74.26  does not have a very significant warm absorber .",
    "the highly ionized component detected by _",
    "chandra _ was termed as `` weak '' ( kaspi , private communication ) .",
    "furthermore , the column estimated from the absori model is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the columns found in ngc  3783 or ngc  3516 .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that curvature caused by ionized absorption will significantly effect the spectrum at energies close to the iron line . as a result ,",
    "we concentrate on partial covering models @xcite and use the zpcfabs model within xspec to simulate the effect of the primary x - ray continuum passing through a neutral absorber with hydrogen column density @xmath62 that covers a fraction @xmath63 of the x - ray source .",
    "the attenuated continuum is assumed to consist of a reflection spectrum , modeled with the pexrav code of @xcite ( same parameter values as in paper i ) , and an intrinsically narrow ( @xmath64  kev ) neutral fe  k@xmath7  line .",
    "the warm absorber is modeled with the o  vii  and o  viii  edges , and galactic absorption was also included .",
    "the subsequent fit was poor with @xmath38d.o.f.=1752/1640 , @xmath65  @xmath1 , and @xmath66 .",
    "an improved fit was found by adding additional cold absorption with the ztbabs model . in this case ,",
    "@xmath38d.o.f.=1674/1639 , @xmath67  @xmath1 and @xmath68 .",
    "this fit also gave a photon - index of @xmath69 and a reflection fraction of 2.5 .",
    "the column of extra cold absorption was @xmath70  @xmath1 .",
    "a further improvement to @xmath38d.o.f.=1631/1640 was found by replacing the pexrav and gaussian models with a solar abundance @xcite reflector that had its ionization parameter frozen at its lowest value . in this case , @xmath71  @xmath1 and @xmath72 .",
    "the photon - index was @xmath73 and a low reflection fraction of @xmath74 was also found .    in summary ,",
    "all the partial covering models considered here provide poorer fits to the 0.312  kev  pn spectrum of 4c+74.26  than the ones that included a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath7  line .",
    "the line should still be confirmed with a higher signal - to - noise observation , but these results help strengthen the conclusions presented in paper i.      figures  [ fig : ratio ] and  [ fig : ratio2 ] both show a possible absorption line in the residuals at @xmath75  kev .",
    "a narrow ( @xmath76 ) gaussian absorption line added to the best - fit model described above resulted in a @xmath77 with 2 extra degrees of freedom , significant at the @xmath78  per cent level according to the f - test . however , this line is not of an astrophysical origin .",
    "it arises from the subtraction of a strong cu  k@xmath7 emission line in the background spectrum produced by the circuit board supporting the pn detector in the spacecraft ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is important to note that the strength of the this line is not constant over the instrument .",
    "in fact , it is practically absent near the center where the image of the target source falls .",
    "but , if the background accumulation region is closer to the edge of a ccd ( as it was in this case ) , it will include this line which will then produce a spurious absorption feature in the source data .",
    "interestingly , if the line was interpreted as fe  xxvi  ly@xmath7 , whose rest energy is 6.97  kev , then one would conclude that it was blueshifted to a velocity of @xmath79 . thus , this feature could easily be misidentified as a highly ionized and rapidly outflowing absorption feature .",
    "as the cu k@xmath7 line is very narrow , when our 4c+74.26  spectral analysis was repeated with a different background region that omitted the line , the results did not significantly change .",
    "we therefore included the affected plots in this paper to illustrate the potential danger to future authors .",
    "this paper presented the first detailed characterization of the broadband x - ray spectrum of 4c+74.26 . at energies less than 2",
    "kev , the spectrum is dominated by cold absorption in excess of the galactic column in this direction . if this extra attenuation is at the redshift of 4c+74.26 , then the column required is @xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "this value is about two times smaller than the previous estimates based on either _ asca _ or _ bepposax _ data @xcite , although it is not too different from the @xcite value .",
    "differing spectral models , analysis techniques and the superior quality of the _ xmm - newton _  data are most likely responsible for these disagreements .",
    "an excess column of cold absorption appears to be common in radio - loud agn @xcite , and 4c+74.26  is no different despite exhibiting typical seyfert properties in almost every other regard . in this case ,",
    "perhaps the larger inclination angle of @xmath80@xmath81  degrees ( as inferred from the fe  k@xmath7  emission line ; paper i & table  [ table : fit1 ] ) implies that the line - of - sight to the central engine has a longer path length within the host galaxy .",
    "alternatively , the host galaxy of 4c+74.26 , like most radio - loud agn , is an elliptical ; therefore , unlike spiral galaxies , random lines - of - sights into the galaxy are unlikely to have a clear path to the center .",
    "in addition to the excess cold absorption , 4c+74.26  also exhibits a weak warm absorber , as primarily evidenced by a significant o  viiedge . while a proper parametrization of the warm absorber awaits a long gratings observation , we estimated the absorbing column and ionization parameter to be @xmath82  @xmath1 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the high - throughput capabilities of _ xmm - newton _  are allowing the discovery of warm absorbers in many more quasars than before @xcite , emphasizing that they are a common occurrence in all accreting supermassive black holes .",
    "this analysis of the soft x - ray spectrum of 4c+74.26  does offer one surprise that will need to be followed up with a longer observation .",
    "the best fit broadband spectral model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] includes a very weakly ionized reflector which predicts a number of recombination lines a low energies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular from o  vii  and o  viii .",
    "these lines do seem to fit the data , but whether they originate in the accretion disk or warm absorber ( or both ) is unknown . this may be elucidated with a long gratings observation of 4c+74.26  which would unravel the properties of the warm absorber .",
    "based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",

    "<S> this paper presents a timing study and broadband spectral analysis of the broad - line radio galaxy 4c+74.26  based on a 35  ks _ xmm - newton_observation . </S>",
    "<S> as found in previous datasets , the source exhibits no evidence for rapid variability , and its 0.210  kev  lightcurve is well fit by a constant . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent fit to the pn 0.312  kevspectrum was found using a continuum that combines an ionized and a neutral reflector , augmented by both cold and warm absorption . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for a soft excess . </S>",
    "<S> the column of cold absorption was greater than the galactic value with an intrinsic column of @xmath0  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for the warm absorber was found from o  vii  and o  viii  absorption edges with maximum optical depths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a joint pn - mos fit increased the o  viii  optical depth to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple , one - zone warm absorber model yielded a column of @xmath5  @xmath1 and an ionization parameter of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> partial covering models provide significantly worse fits than ones including a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath7  line , strengthening the case for the existence of such a line . on the whole , the x - ray spectrum of 4c+74.26exhibits many features typical of both a radio - loud quasar ( excess absorption ) and radio - quiet seyfert  1 galaxies ( fe  k@xmath7  emission and warm absorption ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that a spurious absorption line at @xmath8  kev  can be created by the subtraction of an instrumental cu k@xmath7 emission line .    </S>",
