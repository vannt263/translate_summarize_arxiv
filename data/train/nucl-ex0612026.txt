    "the pion is considered one of the main transmitters of the force between nucleons . as a consequence",
    ", nucleons are visualized in a simplified picture to be surrounded by a cloud of pions ; thus , the wave function of a proton ( neutron ) is expected to have a component contributed by a neutron ( proton ) surrounded by a positive ( negative ) pion .",
    "this pion cloud will then manifest itself as an extension to the charge distribution of protons and neutrons , which should be observable in the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon at relatively small values of the momentum transfer .",
    "nucleon electro - magnetic form factors ( emffs ) are optimally studied through the exchange of a virtual photon , in elastic electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "polarization instrumentation , polarized beams and targets , and the measurement of the recoil polarization have been essential in the accurate separation of the charge and magnetic form factors and in studies of the neutron charge form factor .    through the mid-1990s",
    "practically all available proton emff data had been collected using the rosenbluth separation technique , in which the cross section is measured at fixed @xmath0  as a function of the linear polarization of the virtual photon @xmath1 . because the @xmath2  contribution to the elastic cross section is weighted with @xmath0 , data on @xmath3  suffer from increasing systematic uncertainties with increasing @xmath0-values .",
    "more than 40 years ago akhiezer _ et al._@xcite ( followed 20 years later by arnold _",
    "et al._@xcite ) showed that the accuracy of nucleon charge form - factor measurements could be increased significantly by scattering polarized electrons off a polarized target ( or equivalently by measuring the polarization of the recoiling proton ) .",
    "however , it took several decades before technology had sufficiently advanced to make the first of such measurements feasible and only in the past few years has a large number of new data with a significantly improved accuracy become available . for @xmath3  measurements the highest figure of merit at @xmath0-values larger than a few",
    "gev@xmath4  is obtained with a focal plane polarimeter . here , the jacobian focusing of the recoiling proton kinematics allows one to couple a standard magnetic spectrometer for the proton detection to a large - acceptance non - magnetic detector for the detection of the scattered electron . for studies of @xmath5",
    "one needs to use a magnetic spectrometer to detect the scattered electron in order to cleanly identify the reaction channel . as a consequence ,",
    "the figure of merit of a polarized @xmath6  target is comparable to that of a neutron polarimeter .",
    "in elastic electron - proton scattering a longitudinally polarized electron will transfer its polarization to the recoil proton . in the one - photon exchange approximation",
    "the proton can attain only polarization components in the scattering plane , parallel ( @xmath7 ) and transverse ( @xmath8 ) to its momentum .",
    "the ratio of the charge and magnetic form factors is directly proportional to the ratio of these polarization components .",
    "the greatest impact of the polarization - transfer technique was made by the two recent experiments@xcite in hall a at jefferson lab , which measured the ratio @xmath9  in a @xmath0-range from 0.5 to 5.6 gev@xmath4 .",
    "the most striking feature of the data is the sharp , practically linear decline as @xmath0  increases .",
    "since it is known that @xmath2  closely follows the dipole parametrization @xmath10 , it follows that @xmath3  falls more rapidly with @xmath0   than @xmath10 .",
    "this significant fall - off of the form - factor ratio is in clear disagreement with the results from the rosenbluth extraction .",
    "et al._@xcite performed a high - precision rosenbluth extraction in hall a at jefferson lab , designed specifically to significantly reduce the systematic errors compared to earlier rosenbluth measurements .",
    "the main improvement came from detecting the recoiling protons instead of the scattered electrons .",
    "one of the spectrometers was used as a luminosity monitor during an @xmath1 scan .",
    "the results@xcite of this experiment , covering @xmath0-values from 2.6 to 4.1 gev@xmath4 , are in excellent agreement with previous rosenbluth results .",
    "this basically rules out the possibility that the disagreement between rosenbluth and polarization - transfer measurements of the ratio @xmath9  is due to an underestimate of @xmath1-dependent uncertainties in the rosenbluth measurements . at the bates large acceptance spectrometer toroid facility ( blast , http://blast.lns.mit.edu/ ) at mit a polarized hydrogen target",

    "two-(or more-)photon exchange ( tpe ) contributions to elastic electron scattering have been investigated both experimentally and theoretically for the past fifty years .",
    "almost all analyses with the rosenbluth technique have used radiative corrections that only include the infrared divergent parts of the box diagram ( in which one of the two exchanged photons is soft ) .",
    "thus , terms in which both photons are hard ( and which depend on the hadronic structure ) have been ignored .",
    "the most stringent tests of tpe on the nucleon have been carried out by measuring the ratio of electron and positron elastic scattering off a proton .",
    "corrections due to tpe will have a different sign in these two reactions .",
    "unfortunately , this ( e@xmath11e@xmath12 ) data set is quite limited@xcite , only extending ( with poor statistics ) up to a @xmath0-value of @xmath13 gev@xmath4 , whereas at @xmath0-values larger than @xmath14 gev@xmath4  basically all data have been measured at @xmath1-values larger than @xmath15 .",
    "several studies have provided estimates of the size of the @xmath1-dependent corrections necessary to resolve the discrepancy . because the fall - off of the form - factor ratio is linear with @xmath0 , and the rosenbluth formula also shows a linear dependence of the form - factor ratio ( squared ) with @xmath0  through the @xmath16-term , a @xmath0-independent correction linear in @xmath1 would cancel the disagreement . an additional constraint that any @xmath1-dependent modification must satisfy ,",
    "is the ( e@xmath11e@xmath12 ) data set .",
    "blunden _ et al._@xcite carried out the first calculation of the elastic contribution from tpe effects , albeit with a simple monopole @xmath0-dependence of the hadronic form factors . they obtained a practically @xmath0-independent correction factor with a linear @xmath1-dependence that vanishes at forward angles ( @xmath17 )",
    ". however , the size of the correction only resolves about half of the discrepancy . a later calculation which used a more realistic form factor behavior , resolved up to 60% of the discrepancy .",
    "a different approach was used by chen _",
    "et al._@xcite , who related the elastic electron - nucleon scattering to the scattering off a parton in a nucleon through generalized parton distributions .",
    "tpe effects in the lepton - quark scattering process are calculated in the hard - scattering amplitudes .",
    "the results for the tpe contribution reduce the discrepancy between the rosenbluth and the polarization - transfer data by over 50% .",
    "it is highly likely that a combination of the calculations by blunden _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "in which double counting is avoided , could fully reconcile the rosenbluth and the polarization - transfer data .",
    "of course , further effort is needed to investigate the model - dependence of the tpe calculations .",
    "experimental confirmation of tpe effects will be difficult , but certainly should be continued .",

    "additional efforts should be extended to studies of tpe effects in other longitudinal - transverse separations , such as proton knock - out and deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments .",

    "the recent production of very accurate emff data , especially the surprising @xmath3  data from polarization transfer , has prompted the theoretical community to intensify their investigation of nucleon structure .",
    "one expects the three lightest vector mesons ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) to play an important role in the interaction of the photon with a nucleon .",
    "the first emff models were based on this principle , called vector meson dominance ( vmd ) , in which one assumes that the virtual photon - after becoming a quark - antiquark pair - couples to the nucleon as a vector meson . with this model iachello",
    "et al._@xcite predicted a linear drop of the proton form - factor ratio , similar to that measured by polarization transfer , more than 20 years before the data became available .",
    "gari and krmpelmann@xcite extended the vmd model to conform with pqcd scaling at large @xmath0-values .",
    "the vmd picture is not complete , as becomes obvious from the fact that the pauli isovector form factor @xmath33 is much larger than the isoscalar one @xmath34 .",
    "an improved description requires the inclusion of the isovector @xmath35 channel through dispersion relations@xcite . by adding more parameters , such as the width of the @xmath30-meson and the masses of heavier vector mesons@xcite , the vmd models succeeded in describing new emff data as they became available , but with little predictive power .",
    "figure [ chiral ] confirms that lomon s calculations provide an excellent description of all emff data .",
    "bijker and iachello@xcite have extended the original calculations by also including a meson - cloud contribution in @xmath36 , but still taking only two isoscalar and one isovector poles into account .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the nucleon is estimated to have an rms radius of @xmath27 0.34 fm .",
    "these new calculations are in good agreement with the proton form - factor data , but do rather poorly for the neutron .",
    "many recent theoretical studies of the emffs have applied various forms of a relativistic constituent quark model ( rcqm ) .",
    "nucleons are assumed to be composed of three constituent quarks , which are quasi - particles where all degrees of freedom associated with the gluons and @xmath37 pairs are parametrized by an effective mass . because the momentum transfer can be several times the nucleon mass ,",
    "the constituent quarks require a relativistic quantum mechanical treatment .",
    "although most of these calculations correctly describe the emff behaviour at large @xmath0-values , effective degrees of freedom , such as a pion cloud and/or a finite size of the constituent quarks , are introduced to correctly describe the behaviour at lower @xmath0-values .",
    "miller@xcite uses an extension of the cloudy bag model@xcite , with three relativistically moving ( in light - front kinematics ) constituent quarks , surrounded by a pion cloud .",
    "cardarelli and simula@xcite also use light - front kinematics , but they calculate the nucleon wave function by solving the three - quark hamiltonian in the isgur - capstick one - gluon - exchange potential . in order to get good agreement with the emff data they introduce a finite size of the constituent quarks in agreement with recent dis data .",
    "the results of wagenbrunn _",
    "et al._@xcite are calculated in a covariant manner in the point - form spectator approximation ( pfsa ) .",
    "in addition to a linear confinement , the quark - quark interaction is based on goldstone - boson exchange dynamics .",
    "the pfsa current is effectively a three - body operator ( in the case of the nucleon as a three - quark system ) because of its relativistic nature .",
    "it is still incomplete but it leads to surprisingly good results for the electric radii and magnetic moments of the other light and strange baryon ground states beyond the nucleon .",
    "giannini _ et al._@xcite",
    "have explicitly introduced a three - quark interaction in the form of a gluon - gluon interaction in a hypercentral model , which successfully describes various static baryon properties .",

    ".    however , all theories described until now are at least to some extent effective ( or parametrizations ) .",
    "they use models constructed to focus on certain selected aspects of qcd .",
    "only lattice gauge theory can provide a truly ab initio calculation , but accurate lattice qcd results for the emffs are still several years away .",
    "one of the most advanced lattice calculations of emffs has been performed by the qcdsf collaboration@xcite .",
    "the technical state of the art limited these calculations to the quenched approximation ( in which sea - quark contributions are neglected ) , to a box size of 1.6 fm and to a pion mass of @xmath27 500 mev .",
    "et al._@xcite have extrapolated the results of these calculations to the chiral limit , using chiral coefficients appropriate to full qcd .",
    "the agreement with the data is poorer than that of any of the phenomenological calculations . in a more recent calculation@xcite the isovector nucleon form factors",
    "were calculated both in the quenched approximation and using unquenched configurations for pion masses down to 380 mev .",
    "although unquenching effects were shown to be small , both quenched and unquenched results are larger than the experimental data . moreover , the smaller radii obtained showed that pion cloud contributions are underestimated at the pion masses used .",
    "clearly , significant technology developments are required before lattice qcd calculations can provide a stringent test of experimental emff data .",
    "the charge and magnetization rms radii are related to the slope of the form factor at @xmath0= 0 .",

    "his result for the proton charge radius is in excellent agreement with the most recent three - loop qed calculation@xcite of the hydrogen lamb shift . within error bars the rms radii for the proton charge and magnetization distribution and for the neutron magnetization distribution are equal . the foldy term @xmath41 fm@xmath4 is close to the value of the neutron charge radius .",
    "isgur@xcite showed that the foldy term is canceled by a first - order relativistic correction , which implies that the measured value of the neutron charge radius is indeed dominated by its internal structure .",
    "its negative value can be interpreted as supportive evidence for the picture of a neutron in part behaving as a proton surrounded by a negative pion .",

    "if the wavelength of the probe is larger than the compton wavelength of the nucleon , i.e. if @xmath48 , the form factors are not solely determined by the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "then , they also contain dynamical effects due to relativistic boosts and consequently the physical interpretation of the form factors becomes complicated .",
    "kelly@xcite has extracted spatial nucleon densities from the available form factor data .",
    "he selected a model for the lorentz contraction of the breit frame in which the asymptotic behavior of the form factors conformed to perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( pqcd ) scaling at large @xmath0-values and expanded the densities in a complete set of radial basis functions , with constraints at large radii .",
    "the neutron and proton magnetization densities are found to be quite similar , narrower than the proton charge density .",
    "he reports a neutron charge density with a positive core surrounded by a negative surface charge , peaking at just below 1 fm , which he attributes to a negative pion cloud .",
    "friedrich & walcher@xcite observe as a feature common to all emffs a bump / dip at @xmath49 0.5 gev with a width of @xmath27 0.2 gev , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "a fit to all four emffs was performed , assuming a dipole behaviour for the form factors of the constituent quarks and an @xmath50 harmonic oscillator behaviour for that of the pion cloud .",
    "they then transformed their results to coordinate space , neglecting the lorentz boost , where they find that the pion cloud peaks at a radius of @xmath27 1.3 fm , slightly larger than kelly did , close to the compton wavelength of the pion .",
    "hammer _ et al._@xcite argue from general principles that the pion cloud should peak much more inside the nucleon , at @xmath27 0.3 fm . however , they assign the full @xmath512@xmath52 continuum to the pion cloud which includes different contributions than just the one - pion loop that kelly ( and friedrich & walcher ) assign to the pion cloud . the structure at @xmath27 0.5 gev , common to all emffs , is at such a small @xmath0-value that its transformation to coordinate space should be straightforward .",
    "several theoretical models for the nucleon have explicitly included , albeit phenomenologically , the effect of a pionic cloud .",
    "miller@xcite has shown that in his cloudy - bag model the pionic contributions to @xmath5  dominate at small @xmath0values ( see fig .",
    "[ rcqm ] ) .",
    "et al._@xcite have developed a lorentz covariant chiral quark model , in which nucleons are considered bound states of constituent quarks further dressed by a cloud of pseudoscalar mesons . in a first step the parameters of their chirally symmetric lagrangian",
    "are fitted to the magnetic moments of the baryonic octet .",
    "next , the form - factor data for @xmath0  @xmath53 0.7 gev@xmath4  are fitted with a dipole form multiplied by a gaussian , with a total of ten free parameters .",
    "then , the pseudoscalar meson cloud contribution is fixed through chiral perturbation theory on the hadron level .",
    "the meson cloud contribution is forced through a gradual cut - off function to be strongly suppressed for large @xmath0  -values .",
    "the results provide an excellent description of the available form - factor data .",
    "interestingly , the bump ( dip ) at @xmath27 0.5 gev in @xmath5  ( @xmath3  ) is attributed completely to the meson cloud , whereas the meson cloud already contributes to the static magnetic moment with a @xmath0  -behaviour peaking at @xmath0= 0 gev@xmath4 .",

    "there remains a strong disagreement about the interpretation of the apparent structure in the four nucleon form factors at @xmath27 0.5 gev . while a seemingly straightforward picture of a pionic cloud surrounding the nucleon can explain the structure , a recent dispersion analysis@xcite indicates that the @xmath57 continuum contributions are much more confined in coordinate space .",
    "the structure in the data can only be reproduced by additional low - mass strength in the spectral function in a @xmath58-region that is already well understood .",
