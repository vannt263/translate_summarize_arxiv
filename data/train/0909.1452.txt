    "in this paper , we continue our general study of the _ uniform thickness property _ ( utp ) in the context of iterated torus knots that are embedded in @xmath0 with the standard tight contact structure . as stated in a previous paper , _ studying uniform thickness i _",
    "@xcite , our goal in this study is to determine the extent to which iterated torus knot types fail to satisfy the utp , and the extent to which this failure leads to cablings that are legendrian or transversally non - simple .",
    "motivation for this study is due to the work of etnyre and honda @xcite , who showed that the failure of the utp is a necessary condition for transversal non - simplicity in the class of iterated torus knots .",
    "they also established that the @xmath1 torus knot fails the utp and supports a transversally non - simple cabling .",
    "in @xcite we extended this study of the utp by establishing new necessary conditions for both the failure of the utp and transversal non - simplicity in the class of iterated torus knots ; in so doing we obtained new families of legendrian simple iterated torus knots .",
    "the specific goal of this note is to fully answer the first motivating question of our study by providing a complete utp classification of iterated torus knots , that is , determining which iterated torus knot types satisfy the utp , and which fail the utp .",
    "we will also address the second motivating question of our study by proving that failure of the utp for an iterated torus knot type is a sufficient condition for the existence of transversally non - simple cablings of that knot .",
    "specifically , we have the following two theorems and corollary :    [ main theorem ] let @xmath2 be an iterated torus knot , where the @xmath3 s are measured in the standard preferred framing , and @xmath4 for all @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath6 fails the utp if and only if @xmath7 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath8 .    in the second theorem ,",
    "@xmath9 is the euler characteristic of a minimal genus seifert surface for a knot @xmath10 :    [ second theorem ] if @xmath6 is an iterated torus knot that fails the utp , then it supports infinitely many transversally non - simple cablings @xmath11 of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ranges over an infinite subset of positive integers .    to state our corollary to theorem [ main theorem ] ,",
    "recall that if @xmath10 is a fibered knot , then there is an associated open book decomposition of @xmath0 that supports a contact structure , denoted @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "iterated torus knots are fibered knots , and hedden has shown that the subclass of iterated torus knots where each iteration is a positive cabling , i.e. @xmath7 for all @xmath5 , is precisely the subclass of iterated torus knots where @xmath15 is isotopic to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain the following corollary :    an iterated torus knot @xmath6 fails the utp if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "we make a few remarks about these theorems .",
    "first , it will be shown that these transversally non - simple cablings will all have two legendrian isotopy classes at the same rotation number and maximal thurston - bennequin number @xmath18 , and thus they will exhibit legendrian non - simplicity at @xmath18 .",
    "second , in the class of iterated torus knots there are certainly more transversally non - simple cablings than those in theorem [ second theorem ] , as evidenced by etnyre and honda s example of the transversally non - simple @xmath1-cabling of a @xmath1-torus knot . however , we present just the class of transversally non - simple cablings in theorem [ second theorem ] , and leave a more complete legendrian and transversal classification of iterated torus knots as an open question",
    ".    we now present a conjectural generalization of the above two theorems and corollary . to this end ,",
    "recall that hedden has shown that for general fibered knots @xmath10 in @xmath0 , @xmath19 precisely when @xmath10 is a fibered strongly quasipositive knot @xcite ; he also shows that for these knots , the maximal self - linking number is @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the work of etnyre and van horn - morris @xcite , we know that for fibered knots @xmath10 in @xmath0 that support the standard contact structure there is a unique transversal isotopy class at @xmath21 . in the present paper , all of these ideas are brought to bear on the class of iterated torus knots , and this motivates the following conjecture concerning general fibered knots :    let @xmath10 be a fibered knot in @xmath0 ; then @xmath10 fails the utp if and only if @xmath19 , and hence if and only if @xmath10 is fibered strongly quasipositive .",
    "moreover , if a topologically non - trivial fibered knot @xmath10 fails the utp , then it supports cablings that are transversally non - simple .",
    "we also ask the following question of non - fibered knots in @xmath0 :    if @xmath10 is a non - fibered strongly quasipositive knot , does @xmath10 fail the utp and support transversally non - simple cablings ?",
    "we will be using tools developed by giroux , kanda , and honda , and used by etnyre and honda in their work , namely convex tori and annuli , the classification of tight contact structures on solid tori and thickened tori , and the legendrian classificaton of torus knots . most of the results we use can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , and if we use a lemma , proposition , or theorem from one of these works , it will be specifically referenced .",
    "the plan of the note is as follows . in ",
    "2 we recall definitions , notation , and identities used in @xcite and @xcite . in  3 we outline a strategy of proof of theorem [ main theorem ] that yields the statement of two key lemmas . in  4 and  5",
    "we prove the first lemma . in ",
    "6 we prove the second lemma and complete the proof of theorem [ main theorem ] . in ",
    "7 we prove theorem [ second theorem ] .",
    "_ iterated torus knots _ , as topological knot types , can be defined recursively .",
    "let 1-iterated torus knots be simply torus knots @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 co - prime nonzero integers , and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the algebraic intersection with a longitude , and @xmath24 is the algebraic intersection with a meridian in the preferred framing for a torus representing the unknot . then for each @xmath22 torus knot , take a solid torus regular neighborhood @xmath26 ; the boundary of this is a torus , and given a framing we can describe simple closed curves on that torus as co - prime pairs @xmath27 , with @xmath28 . in this way we obtain all 2-iterated torus knots , which we represent as ordered pairs , @xmath29 .",
    "recursively , suppose the @xmath30-iterated torus knots are defined ; we can then take regular neighborhoods of all of these , choose a framing , and form the @xmath31-iterated torus knots as ordered @xmath31-tuples @xmath32 , again with @xmath33 and @xmath34 co - prime , and @xmath35 .",
    "for ease of notation , if we are looking at a general @xmath31-iterated torus knot type , we will refer to it as @xmath6 ; a legendrian representative will usually be written as @xmath36 .",
    "note that we will use the letter @xmath31 both for the rotation number ( see below ) and as an index for our iterated torus knots ; context will distinguish between the two uses .",
    "we will study iterated torus knots using two framings .",
    "the first is the standard framing for a torus , where the meridian bounds a disc inside the solid torus , and we use the preferred longitude which bounds a surface in the complement of the solid torus .",
    "we will refer to this framing as @xmath37 .",
    "the second framing is a non - standard framing using a different longitude that comes from the cabling torus .",
    "more precisely , to identify this non - standard longitude on @xmath38 , we first look at @xmath6 as it is embedded in @xmath39 . we take a small neighborhood @xmath40 such that @xmath38 intersects @xmath39 in two parallel simple closed curves . these curves are longitudes on @xmath38 in this second framing , which we will refer to as @xmath41 .",
    "note that this @xmath41 framing is well - defined for any cabled knot type .",
    "moreover , for purpose of calculations there is an easy way to change between the two framings , which will be reviewed below .    given a simple closed curve @xmath42 on a torus , measured in some framing as having @xmath43 meridians and @xmath44 longitudes",
    ", we will say this curve has slope of @xmath45 ; i.e. , longitudes over meridians",
    ". therefore we will refer to the longitude in the @xmath41 framing as @xmath46 , and the longitude in the @xmath37 framing as @xmath47 .",
    "the meridian in both framings will have slope @xmath48 .",
    "we will also use a convention that meridians in the standard @xmath37 framing , that is , algebraic intersection with @xmath47 , will be denoted by upper - case @xmath49 s . on the other hand , meridians in the non - standard @xmath50 framing , that is , algebraic intersection with @xmath51 , will be denoted by lower - case @xmath52 s . given a curve @xmath53 on a torus @xmath54",
    ", there is then a relationship between the framings @xmath50 and @xmath37 on @xmath54 . in terms of a change of basis ,",
    "we get from @xmath50 to @xmath37 by multiplying on the left by the matrix @xmath55 .",
    "given an iterated torus knot type @xmath56 where the @xmath57 s are measured in the @xmath50 framing , we define two quantities .",
    "the two quantities are :    @xmath58    note here we use a convention that @xmath59 . also , if we restrict to the first @xmath5    iterations , that is , to @xmath60 , we have an associated @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "for example , @xmath63 .",
    "finally , from @xcite we obtain four useful identities which we will apply extensively throughout this note :    @xmath64      recall that for legendrian knots embedded in @xmath0 with the standard tight contact structure , there are two classical invariants of legendrian isotopy classes , namely the thurston - bennequin number , @xmath65 , and the rotation number , @xmath31 . for a given topological knot type , if the ordered pair @xmath66 completely determines the legendrian isotopy classes , then that knot type is said to be _",
    "legendrian simple_. for transversal knots there is one classical invariant , the self - linking number @xmath67 ; for a given topological knot type , if the value of @xmath67 completely determines the transversal isotopy classes , then that knot type is said to be _ transversally simple_. for a given topological knot type , if we plot legendrian isotopy classes at points @xmath66 , we obtain a plot of points that takes the form of a _",
    "legendrian mountain range _ for that knot type",
    ".    we will be examining legendrian knots which are embedded in convex tori .",
    "recall that the characteristic foliation induced by the contact structure on a convex torus can be assumed to have a standard form , where there are @xmath68 parallel _ legendrian divides _ and a one - parameter family of _ legendrian rulings_. parallel push - offs of the legendrian divides gives a family of @xmath68 _ dividing curves _ , referred to as @xmath69 . for a particular convex torus , the slope of components of @xmath69 is fixed and is called the _ boundary slope _ of any solid torus which it bounds ; however , the legendrian rulings can take on any slope other than that of the dividing curves by giroux s flexibility theorem @xcite .",
    "a _ standard neighborhood _ of a legendrian knot @xmath70 will have two dividing curves and a boundary slope of @xmath71 .",
    "we can now state the definition of the _ uniform thickness property _ as given by etnyre and honda @xcite . for a knot type @xmath10 ,",
    "define the _ contact width _ of @xmath10 to be    @xmath72    in this equation the @xmath73 are solid tori having representatives of @xmath10 as their cores ; slopes are measured using the preferred framing where the longitude has slope @xmath47 ; the supremum is taken over all solid tori @xmath73 representing @xmath10 where @xmath74 is convex .",
    "a knot type @xmath10 then satisfies the utp if the following hold :    * @xmath75 , where @xmath18 is the maximal thurston - bennequin number for @xmath10 . * every solid torus @xmath73 representing @xmath10 can be thickened to a standard neighborhood of a maximal @xmath65 legendrian knot .    for a topological knot type @xmath10 ,",
    "if @xmath73 is a solid torus having a representative of @xmath10 as its core and convex boundary , then @xmath73 _ fails to thicken _ if for all @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 .",
    "if we define @xmath78 to be the twisting of the contact planes along @xmath70 with respect to the @xmath50 framing on @xmath79 , equation 2.1 in @xcite gives us :    @xmath80    observe that @xmath81 is also the twisting of the contact planes with respect to the framing given by @xmath74 , and so is equal to @xmath82 times the geometric intersection number of @xmath70 with @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 will denote the maximal twisting number with respect to this framing .",
    "we also had two definitions introduced in @xcite that will be useful in this note .",
    "_ let @xmath73 be a solid torus with convex boundary in standard form , and with @xmath85 in some framing .",
    "if @xmath86 is the geometric intersection of the dividing set @xmath69 with a longitude ruling in that framing , then we will call @xmath87 the _ intersection boundary slope__.    note that when we have an intersection boundary slope @xmath87 , then @xmath88 is the number of dividing curves .    _ for @xmath89 and positive integer @xmath13 , define @xmath90 to be any solid torus representing @xmath6 with intersection boundary slope of @xmath91 , as measured in the @xmath50 framing . also define the integer @xmath92 .",
    "_    note that @xmath90 has @xmath93 dividing curves .",
    "note also that the above definition is only for @xmath94 .",
    "however , we will also define @xmath95 to be a standard neighborhood of a @xmath96 representative , and thus have this as the @xmath97 case .    finally , recall that if @xmath98 is a convex annulus with legendrian boundary components , then dividing curves are arcs with endpoints on either one or both of the boundary components . dividing curves that are boundary parallel are called _ bypasses _ ; an annulus with no bypasses is said to be _",
    "standard convex_.      recall that a contact structure @xmath99 on a 3-manifold @xmath100 is said to be _ overtwisted _ if there exists an embedded disc @xmath101 which is tangent to @xmath99 everywhere along @xmath102 , and a contact structure is _ tight _ if it is not overtwisted .",
    "moreover , one can further analyze tight contact 3-manifolds @xmath103 by looking at what happens to @xmath99 when pulled back to the universal cover @xmath104 via the covering map @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , if the pullback of @xmath99 remains tight , then @xmath103 is said to be _ universally tight_.    the classification of universally tight contact structures on solid tori is known from the work of honda .",
    "specifically , from proposition 5.1 in @xcite , we know there are exactly two universally tight contact structures on @xmath106 with boundary torus having two dividing curves and slope @xmath107 in some framing .",
    "these are such that a convex meridional disc has boundary - parallel dividing curves that separate half - discs all of the same sign , and thus the two contact structures differ by @xmath108 .",
    "( if @xmath109 , there is only one tight contact structure , and it is universally tight . )    also from the work of honda , we know that if @xmath99 is a contact structure which is everywhere transverse to the fibers of a circle bundle @xmath100 over a closed oriented surface @xmath110 , then @xmath99 is universally tight .",
    "this is the content of lemma 3.9 in @xcite , and such a transverse contact structure is said to be _",
    "horizontal_.      given a legendrian knot @xmath70 , recall that there are well - defined _ positive and negative transverse push - offs _ , denoted by @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the self - linking numbers of these transverse push - offs are given by the formula    @xmath113",
    "in this section we present a strategy of proof for theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "we begin with a theorem that in previous works has in effect been proved , but not stated . in this theorem @xmath10",
    "is a knot type and @xmath114 is the @xmath53-cabling of @xmath10 .",
    "[ utp preserved ] if @xmath10 satisfies the utp , then @xmath114 also satisfies the utp .",
    "the case where the cabling fraction @xmath115 is the content of theorem 1.3 in @xcite . for the case where @xmath116 , the proof follows from examining the proofs of theorem 3.2 @xcite and theorem 1.1 in @xcite and observing that legendrian simplicity of @xmath10 is not needed to preserve the utp .    with this theorem in mind",
    ", we will prove theorem [ main theorem ] by way of two lemmas , one of which uses induction .",
    "for this purpose we make the following inductive hypothesis , which from here on we will refer to as _ the inductive hypothesis_. we will need to justify its veracity for the base case of positive torus knots . + * inductive hypothesis : * let @xmath117 be an iterated torus knot , as measured in the standard @xmath37 framing .",
    "assume that the following hold :    * @xmath7 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath8 .",
    "( thus @xmath118 for all @xmath5 as well . ) * @xmath119 . ( thus @xmath120 . )",
    "* any solid torus @xmath121 representing @xmath6 thickens to some @xmath90 ( including @xmath95 which is a standard neighborhood of a @xmath18 representative ) . *",
    "if @xmath121 fails to thicken then it is an @xmath90 , and it has at least @xmath93 dividing curves . * the candidate non - thickenable @xmath90 exist and actually fail to thicken for @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is some positive integer that varies according to the knot type @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , these @xmath90 that fail to thicken have contact structures that are universally tight , with convex meridian discs containing bypasses all of the same sign .",
    "also , a legendrian ruling preferred longitude on these @xmath124 has rotation number zero for @xmath125 .",
    "+    our first key lemma used in proving theorem [ main theorem ] is the following , which along with the base case of positive torus knots , will show that if @xmath126 is such that @xmath7 for all @xmath5 , then @xmath6 fails the utp .",
    "[ indhyppreserved ] suppose @xmath6 satisfies the inductive hypothesis , and @xmath11 is a cabling where @xmath127 ; then @xmath11 satisfies the inductive hypothesis .",
    "the main idea in the argument used to prove this lemma will be that since @xmath6 satisfies the inductive hypothesis , there is an infinite collection of non - thickenable solid tori whose boundary slopes form an increasing sequence converging to @xmath128 in the @xmath50 framing ( which is @xmath47 in the @xmath37 framing ) . as a consequence , it will be shown that cabling slopes with @xmath127 in the @xmath37 framing will have a similar sequence of non - thickenable solid tori .",
    "our second key lemma is the following , which along with theorem [ utp preserved ] and the fact that negative torus knots satisfy the utp , will show that if at least one of the @xmath129 , then @xmath6 satisfies the utp .",
    "[ negativeutp ] suppose @xmath6 satisfies the inductive hypothesis , and @xmath11 is a cabling where @xmath130 ; then @xmath11 satisfies the utp .",
    "our outline for the next three sections is as follows . in the next section ,  4 , we establish the truth of the inductive hypothesis for the base case of positive torus knots . in ",
    "5 we prove lemma [ indhyppreserved ] , and in  6 we prove lemma [ negativeutp ] .",
    "in this section we show that positive torus knots @xmath22 satisfy the inductive hypothesis described in  3 . from lemma 4.3 in @xcite , we know that items 1 - 4 of the inductive hypothesis are satisfied ; it remains to establish item 5 , that each solid torus candidate @xmath131 actually exists with a universally tight contact structure and the appropriate complement in @xmath0 , and that these @xmath131 indeed fail to thicken ( for all @xmath132 in this case of positive torus knots ) .    to establish item 5 , we employ arguments similar to those used in @xcite for solid tori representing the @xmath1 torus knot , specifically lemmas 5.2 and 5.3 in @xcite . from lemma 4.3 in @xcite , we know that if @xmath131 fails to thicken , its complement @xmath133 must be contactomorphic to the manifold obtained by taking a neighborhood of a hopf link @xmath134 and a standard convex annulus @xmath98 joining the two neighborhoods of the hopf link , where @xmath98 has boundary components that are legendrian ruling representatives of @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , we know that the two components of the hopf link must have @xmath65 values equal to @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively , for @xmath132 .    we first show that the candidate @xmath131 have universally tight contact structures .",
    "if @xmath131 fails to thicken , then its contact structure is universally tight ; moreover , for @xmath138 , a convex meridian disc contains bypasses that all bound half - discs of the same sign . also , a legendrian ruling preferred longitude on @xmath139 has rotation number zero for @xmath125 .",
    "the lemma is immediately true for @xmath97 , so we may assume that @xmath138 . to fix notation ,",
    "let @xmath140 be the legendrian unknot with @xmath141 and let @xmath142 be the unknot with @xmath143",
    ". then @xmath144 thickens outward to @xmath145 ; we denote @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "since @xmath148 and @xmath149 are convex , we can take @xmath150$]-invariant neighborhoods of each ; our convention will be that the two @xmath151 will bound a thickened torus that contains the two @xmath152 .",
    "now @xmath153 is a convex torus with dividing curves that divide the torus into two annuli , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "we locate a ( topological ) meridian curve @xmath43 on @xmath153 that intersects each dividing curve efficiently @xmath156 times , and so that @xmath157 consists of @xmath24 arcs which intersect @xmath154 and @xmath155 at least @xmath13 times each .",
    "we then can realize @xmath43 as a legendrian ruling using theorem 3.7 in @xcite .",
    "we then examine a horizontal convex annulus @xmath158 in the space @xmath159 , bounded by meridian rulings on @xmath151 .",
    "this horizontal convex annulus @xmath158 has two dividing curves that connect its two boundary components ; the other @xmath160 bypasses have endpoints on @xmath153 . by lemma 4.14 in @xcite",
    ", we may assume that all of these bypasses are boundary compressible , meaning there are no nested bypasses .",
    "the two dividing curves connecting the two boundary components of @xmath158 thus divide @xmath158 into two discs , one containing all bypasses of positive sign , the other disc containing all negative bypasses .",
    "we will show that in fact all bypasses on @xmath158 must be of the same sign .    to this end , let @xmath98 be the standard convex annulus with @xmath22 legendrian rulings as its boundary components on @xmath152 .",
    "we first examine @xmath161 , which is @xmath24 arcs with endpoints on the two @xmath162 . at first glance ,",
    "it is possible that there may be points of intersection between these @xmath24 arcs and the boundary - parallel dividing curves on @xmath158 .",
    "however , up to a choice of contact vector field for the convex annulus @xmath158 , we may assume that all boundary - parallel dividing curves for @xmath158 are in a collar neighborhood of @xmath153 and avoid @xmath98 .",
    "this contact vector field may also be chosen so that the two non - separating dividing curves on @xmath158 intersect @xmath98 transversely .",
    "now @xmath163 is one of the annuli that forms @xmath139 , and the intersection of this annulus with @xmath158 will be @xmath24 arcs , which we denote as @xmath164 for @xmath165 . by the above considerations we thus have that , as a collection , the @xmath164 have support that intersects all of the @xmath160 bypasses on @xmath158 .",
    "see figure [ fig : universallytightsetupbb ] .    .",
    "the thick gray arcs represent the intersection of @xmath98 with @xmath158 .",
    "some of the @xmath160 bypasses are shown ; in the figure , @xmath166.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    we next perform edge - rounding for the curves of intersection of @xmath167 and the two annuli coming from @xmath168 ; after edge - rounding we obtain @xmath139 .",
    "thus @xmath139 intersects @xmath158 in @xmath24 ( topological ) meridian curves for @xmath131 ; this set of curves , call it @xmath169 , is _ nonisolating _ in the sense of section 3.3.1 in @xcite , meaning that each curve is transverse to the dividing set of @xmath158 and every component of @xmath170 has boundary that intersects @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , @xmath169 is also a nonisolating set of curves on @xmath139 . then by theorem 3.7 in @xcite",
    ", we can realize the @xmath24 topological meridian curves as legendrian meridian curves for @xmath139 .",
    "now these legendrian meridian curves may not have efficient geometric intersection with @xmath171 .",
    "however , by the construction of @xmath139 , any holonomy of dividing curves on the two annuli coming from the two sides of @xmath172 cancels each other out .",
    "thus we can destabilize these legendrian meridian curves on the surface @xmath139 so that they do have geometric intersection @xmath173 with @xmath171 , and we can do so _ away from the @xmath164_. these destabilizations can thus be accomplished by attachment of bypasses off of the @xmath24 convex meridian discs , but these ( attached ) bypasses will avoid the original @xmath160 bypasses along the @xmath164 .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 convex meridian discs therefore inherit the bypasses of @xmath158 .    by construction , it is possible that one of the @xmath24 convex meridian discs may inherit @xmath174 bypasses from @xmath158 ; if this is the case , however , these bypasses must all be of the same sign , and we have the desired conclusion .",
    "so we may assume that each of the @xmath24 meridian discs intersects @xmath13 bypasses of @xmath158 .",
    "so suppose , for contradiction , that the @xmath160 bypasses on @xmath158 have mixed sign , meaning some are negative and some are positive .",
    "since each of the @xmath24 meridian discs is a convex meridian disc for @xmath131 , then by the classification of tight contact structures on solid tori we know that if one of the discs has a negative bypass , then all of them must ; the same is true for positive bypasses .",
    "but since the negative bypasses on @xmath158 are grouped in succession , and since we may assume @xmath175 , this forces one of the discs to inherit only negative bypasses , contradicting the fact that it is supposed to also have positive bypasses .",
    "thus all of the bypasses on @xmath158 must be of the same sign , as must be all of the bypasses on a convex meridian disc for @xmath131 . as a result the contact structure for @xmath131 is universally tight .",
    "we can now calculate the rotation number for the @xmath22 ruling on @xmath144 . since @xmath159 is universally tight",
    ", one can show that if @xmath176 is a convex seifert surface for the longitude on @xmath177 , we must have @xmath178 . by lemma 2.2 in @xcite",
    ", we have that the @xmath22 ruling on @xmath177 has rotation number equal to    @xmath179    this yields @xmath180 .",
    "we now let @xmath101 be a meridian disc for @xmath131 and @xmath110 be a seifert surface for the preferred longitude on @xmath139 . we know",
    "@xmath181 , and we know that the @xmath22 torus knot , which is @xmath51 on @xmath139 , is actually a @xmath182 knot on @xmath139 in the preferred framing . so using a similar equation from above , we obtain that @xmath183 .",

    "we now show that if @xmath245 fails to thicken , and if it has the minimum number of dividing curves over all such @xmath245 which fail to thicken and have the same boundary slope as @xmath246 , then @xmath245 is actually an @xmath246 .    to see this , as above",
    "we can choose a legendrian @xmath257 that maximizes @xmath65 in the complement of @xmath245 and such that we can join @xmath253 to @xmath254 by a convex annulus @xmath255 whose boundaries are @xmath256 and @xmath51 rulings on @xmath253 and @xmath254 , respectively .",
    "now since @xmath245 fails to thicken , we can assume that @xmath277 and that there are no bypasses on the @xmath253-edge , and in this case we have no bypasses on the @xmath254-edge since @xmath245 fails to thicken and is at minimum number of dividing curves .",
    "as above , let @xmath376 .",
    "we claim this @xmath267 fails to thicken  the proof proceeds identically as above in lemma 5.4 , as does the proof that @xmath245 is in fact an @xmath246 .",

    ". moreover , these @xmath246 have contact structures that are universally tight and have convex meridian discs whose bypasses bound half - discs all of the same sign . also , the preferred longitude on @xmath301 has rotation number zero for @xmath302 .    the proof that the contact structure on a candidate @xmath246 which fails to thicken is universally tight is identical to the argument in case i , as is the proof that their convex meridian discs have bypasses all of the same sign , as well as the proof that the rotation number of the preferred longitude is zero .",
    "now we know inductively that there exists a @xmath123 such that if @xmath122 , then the @xmath90 exist and fail to thicken .",

    "we have completed the utp classification of iterated torus knots ; it now remains to show that in the class of iterated torus knots , failing the utp is a sufficient condition for supporting transversally non - simple cablings . to this end , in this section we prove theorem [ second theorem ] ; we do so by working through a series of lemmas .",
    "these lemmas will first give us information about just a piece of the legendrian mountain range for @xmath117 where @xmath7 for all @xmath5 ; we will then use this information to obtain enough information about the legendrian mountain ranges of certain cables @xmath11 to conclude that these cables are transversally non - simple .",

    "the lemma is true for positive torus knots @xcite , so we inductively assume it is true for @xmath389 .",
    "then look at legendrian rulings @xmath394 on standard neighborhoods of the inductive @xmath395 . in the @xmath50 framing the boundary slope of these @xmath396",
    "is @xmath397 , and so a calculation shows that @xmath398 ; hence @xmath399 .",
    "to calculate the rotation number of @xmath394 , we use the following formula from @xcite , where @xmath101 is a convex meridian disc for @xmath396 and @xmath110 is a seifert surface for the preferred longitude on @xmath400 :              this , along with lemma [ eulerchar ] , shows us that @xmath404 is on the right - most slope of the legendrian mountain range of @xmath6 , and @xmath405 is on the left - most edge . to the former we can perform positive stabilizations to reach @xmath406 at @xmath407 and @xmath408 ; to the latter we can perform negative stabilizations to reach @xmath409 at @xmath407 and @xmath410  we know such stabilizations can be performed since @xmath411 .",
    "so suppose @xmath6 is an iterated torus knot that fails the utp ( which is precisely when @xmath7 for all @xmath5 )",
    ". then we know that for @xmath122 there exist non - thickenable solid tori @xmath90 having intersection boundary slopes of @xmath91 , where these slopes are measured in the @xmath50 framing . switching to the standard @xmath37 framing ,",
    "these intersection boundary slopes are @xmath412 .",
    "now as @xmath413 , there are infinitely many values of @xmath174 which are prime and greater than @xmath414 . as a consequence ,",
    "there are infinitely many @xmath90 with two dividing curves . based on this observation",

    "_    so given @xmath6 , there are infinitely many such cabling knot types @xmath415 , all of these being cablings of the form @xmath417 as measured in the preferred framing .",
    "the following lemma will then prove theorem [ second theorem ] .",
    "we now look at the two universally tight non - thickenable @xmath90 that have representatives of @xmath415 as legendrian divides .",
    "these legendrian divides have @xmath420 . to calculate rotation numbers",
    ", we have two possibilities , depending on which boundary of the two universally tight @xmath90 the legendrian divides reside . using the formula from @xcite",
    ", we obtain      we will call the two legendrian divides corresponding to @xmath422 , @xmath423 respectively .",
    "we can calculate the self - linking number for the negative transverse push - off of @xmath424 to be @xmath425 .",
    "this shows that @xmath424 is on the right - most edge of the legendrian mountain range and is at @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , @xmath426 is on the left - most edge of the legendrian mountain range and is at @xmath18 .",
    "we now look at solid tori @xmath427 with intersection boundary slope @xmath91 , but which _ thicken _ to solid tori with intersection boundary slopes @xmath428 .",
    "such tori @xmath429 are embedded in universally tight basic slices bounded by tori with dividing curves of slope @xmath428 and @xmath128 .",
    "legendrian divides on such @xmath427 have @xmath430 ; to calculate possible rotation numbers for these legendrian divides , we recall the procedure used in the proof of theorem 1.5 in @xcite .",
    "there we used a formula for the rotation numbers from @xcite , where the range of rotation numbers was given by the following ( substituting @xmath431 for @xmath432 ) :      now from lemma [ sliceofmtnrange ] we know that there is an @xmath36 with @xmath434 and @xmath435 . plugging this value of the rotation number into the expression above yields @xmath436 .",
    "we will call the legendrian divides having these rotation numbers @xmath437 , respectively .",
    "important for our purposes is that @xmath437 have the same values of @xmath65 and @xmath31 as @xmath423 .",
    "consider first @xmath442 .",
    "it is in fact one of the dividing curves on @xmath124 , and is also at maximal self - linking number for @xmath415 .",
    "similarly , @xmath443 is one of the dividing curves on @xmath429 , and is also at maximal self - linking number . now from @xcite we know that @xmath415 is a fibered knot that supports the standard contact structure , since it is an iterated torus knot obtained by cabling positively at each iteration . as a consequence , from @xcite , we also know that @xmath415 has a unique transversal isotopy class at @xmath21 . hence we know that @xmath442 and @xmath443 are transversally isotopic .",
    "thus there is a transverse isotopy ( inducing an ambient contact isotopy ) that takes these two dividing curves on the two different tori to each other .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath124 and @xmath429 intersect along one component of the dividing curves ; we call this component @xmath444 .",
    "now suppose , for contradiction , that @xmath440 is transversally isotopic to @xmath441 .",
    "these transverse knots are represented by the other two non - intersecting dividing curves on @xmath124 and @xmath429 , respectively , and there is a transverse isotopy taking one to the other .",
    "we claim that this transverse isotopy can be performed relative to @xmath444 .",
    "to see this , note that associated to @xmath445 is an open book decomposition of @xmath0 , with pages being seifert surfaces @xmath110 for the knot @xmath444 .",
    "moreover , the standard contact structure is supported by this open book decomposition .",
    "thus the transverse isotopy taking @xmath440 to @xmath441 will induce an ambient isotopy of open book decompositions supporting the standard contact structure , all with a transversal representative of @xmath444 on the binding .",
    "since @xmath124 is incompressible in @xmath445 , it is therefore evident that the isotopy taking @xmath440 to @xmath441 can be accomplished simply as an isotopy of @xmath124 relative to @xmath444 .",
    "thus we may assume that after a contact isotopy of @xmath0 , @xmath124 and @xmath429 intersect along their two dividing curves , which we denote as @xmath444 and @xmath446 , and we observe that there is an isotopy ( not necessarily a contact isotopy ) of @xmath90 to @xmath427 relative to @xmath444 and @xmath446 .",
    "we claim that as a result @xmath427 can not thicken , thus obtaining our contradiction .",
    "we do this by noting that the isotopy of @xmath90 to @xmath427 relative to @xmath444 and @xmath446 may be accomplished by the attachment of successive bypasses . since these bypasses are attached in the complement of the two dividing curves , none of these bypass attachments can change the boundary slope .",
    "however , they may increase or decrease the number of dividing curves . starting with @xmath447 ,",
    "we make the following inductive hypothesis , which we will prove is maintained after bypass attachments :    * @xmath448 is a convex torus which contains @xmath444 and @xmath446 , and thus has slope @xmath91 .",
    "* @xmath448 is a boundary - parallel torus in a @xmath150$]-invariant @xmath449 $ ] with @xmath450 , where the boundary tori have two dividing curves .",
    "* there is a contact diffeomorphism @xmath451 which takes @xmath449 $ ] to a standard @xmath452-invariant neighborhood of @xmath124 and matches up their complements .",
    "the argument that follows is similar to lemma 6.8 in @xcite .",
    "first note that item 1 is preserved after a bypass attachment , since such a bypass is in the complement of @xmath444 and @xmath446 , and thus can not change the slope of the dividing curves . to see that items 2 and 3 are preserved",
    ", suppose that @xmath453 is obtained from @xmath448 by a single bypass .",
    "since the slope was not changed , such a ( non - trivial ) bypass must either increase or decrease the number of dividing curves by 2 .",
    "suppose first that the bypass is attached from the inside , so that @xmath454 , where @xmath73 is the solid torus bounded by @xmath448 . for convenience ,",
    "suppose @xmath455 inside the @xmath449 $ ] satisfying items 2 and 3 of the inductive hypothesis .",
    "then we form the new @xmath456 $ ] by taking the old @xmath456 $ ] and adjoining the thickened torus between @xmath448 and @xmath453 . now",
    "@xmath453 bounds a solid torus @xmath457 , and , by the classification of tight contact structures on solid tori , we can factor a nonrotative outer layer which is the new @xmath458 $ ] .    alternatively , if @xmath459 , then we know that @xmath457 thickens to an @xmath90 , and thus there exists a nonrotative outer layer @xmath456 $ ] for @xmath460 , where @xmath148 has two dividing curves",
    ". thus the proof is done , for after enough bypass attachments we will obtain @xmath461 , with @xmath427 non - thickenable . but this is a contradiction , since @xmath427 does thicken ."
