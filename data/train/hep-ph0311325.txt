    "a major effort is currently under way to push the precision of dglap  @xcite splitting functions to next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) accuracy  @xcite .",
    "one of the main applications of such an effort could be to improve the description of the small-@xmath0 parton distributions , which with the current nlo evolution suffer from pathologies such as negative gluon distributions and predictions of a negative @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "furthermore a good knowledge of small-@xmath0 parton distributions will be ever - more relevant as collider energies are increased , for example at the lhc or a possible vlhc , which will be able to probe small-@xmath0 kinematic regions unexplored even at hera .",
    "however a question that remains to be understood is that of the domain in which fixed order expansions are sufficiently convergent as to be reliable .",
    "indeed it is known that at small @xmath0 , there are large logarithmic enhancements of the splitting function at all orders  @xcite , leading formally to the breakdown of the convergence of the series for @xmath11 and it has been argued  @xcite that there is evidence in the data  @xcite for the presence of some such terms .    much effort has been devoted in recent years to resumming these logarithmically enhanced terms , which are expected to lead to a rise at small @xmath0 , as a power of @xmath0 , for the gluon - gluon splitting function , @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out however that the ll@xmath0summation , @xmath13 rises much too steeply  @xcite to be compatible with the more gentle rise of the @xmath14 data  @xcite . on the other hand , the inclusion of the nll@xmath0terms @xmath15",
    " extracted from the nll@xmath0kernel eigenvalue  @xcite and based on several regge - gluon vertices  @xcite and on the @xmath16 cluster  @xcite  leads at moderately small @xmath0 to a negative splitting function  @xcite . since that discovery",
    ", there has been investigation of the origin of these problems , and various approaches have been proposed to estimate yet higher orders  @xcite , the most successful of them being based on a simultaneous treatment of small-@xmath0 and collinear logarithms .",
    "a surprising observation , common to all these approaches , is that in the phenomenologically relevant , moderately small-@xmath0 region , the splitting function actually _ decreases _ , while the power - like rise is delayed to somewhat smaller values of @xmath0 ( resummed curve of figure  [ fig : pgg ]  @xcite , which has been found to be rather close to a splitting function fitted to the @xmath14 data @xcite ) .",
    "the question arises therefore of whether the resulting ` dip ' structure is a well - defined property of the gluon splitting function , or instead perhaps an artefact of the particular schemes used to ` improve ' the small-@xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that the dip has a simple origin , specifically in the structure of the first few terms of the perturbative series , possibly matched to a resummed behaviour at smaller @xmath0 values .",
    "more precisely ( sec .",
    "[ sec : loworders ] ) , in the formal limit of small @xmath3 , the dip is a consequence of an interplay between different fixed orders , and one finds that the simple fixed - order hierarchy breaks down not for @xmath17 as widely expected , but rather for @xmath18 .",
    "the result is that the properties of the dip can be described in terms of a series in powers of @xmath5 . for",
    "phenomenologically relevant values of @xmath3 though , this series in @xmath5 turns out to be very poorly convergent .",
    "instead we find that quite simple resummation arguments , presented in section  [ sec : resummation ] , still enable us to gain some quantitative understanding of the dip properties .",
    "let us start by recalling the structure of the ll@xmath0terms of the @xmath12 splitting function , @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "a number of the lower order terms in the series are absent , @xmath22 , while @xmath23 since these and all further terms are positive , the ll@xmath0splitting function grows monotonically as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "the nll@xmath0terms can be written as @xmath24 where the first few coefficients are  @xcite    [ eq : bcoeffs ] @xmath25    and @xmath26 is the first beta - function coefficient .",
    "these coefficients are given in the @xmath27 scheme  @xcite and for renormalisation scale @xmath28 .",
    "they come from a simple expansion of the nll@xmath0kernel eigenvalue , and  notably @xmath29 and @xmath30  can be traced back to early calculations of nll@xmath0gluon vertices  @xcite and of the @xmath16 cluster  @xcite .",
    "they include  in particular @xmath30  the running coupling effects , which are part of the nll@xmath0corrections . in the @xmath31 scheme",
    "only the @xmath32 parts of @xmath33 and @xmath29 will differ , while from @xmath30 onward the @xmath32 independent part will differ as well .",
    "because of the zeroes in the ll coefficients , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent of the choice of @xmath34",
    ".     splitting function .",
    "the resummed ( nll@xmath35 ) curve corresponds to scheme b of  @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the resummation hierarchy as written above in terms of ll@xmath0and nll@xmath0terms is intended to be applied when @xmath36 is of order @xmath37 , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "let us however examine an intermediate small-@xmath0 limit in which @xmath40 but @xmath41 ( the precise region will be better specified shortly ) .    because the ll@xmath0coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are zero , the lowest order term with @xmath44 enhancement is the nll@xmath0term @xmath45 , which is nnlo in the usual dglap perturbative expansion . since @xmath29 is negative it will lead to an initial _ decrease _ of the splitting function and at some sufficiently small value of @xmath0 the nnlo gluon splitting function  @xcite will become negative , as shown in figure  [ fig : pgg ] , where we have included the small-@xmath0 part of the nnlo @xmath12 , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 in the particular scheme used in the figure  @xcite ) .    at n@xmath48lo , order @xmath49 ,",
    "both ll@xmath0and nll@xmath0terms are present .",
    "since we are in the regime of @xmath39 , the ll@xmath0@xmath50 term will clearly dominate over the nll@xmath0@xmath51 term .",
    "what is interesting however is the interplay between the negative nll@xmath0@xmath52 term and the positive ll@xmath0@xmath50 : @xmath53 where the constant term includes @xmath54 and @xmath55 contributions , and at each order in @xmath3 we have written only the term with the strongest @xmath44 dependence . since @xmath56 is positive and has stronger @xmath57 dependence than the negative @xmath29 term , the splitting function as written in will eventually start rising .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath56 terms will be of the same order when @xmath58 , and the splitting function of eq .",
    "will have a minimum at @xmath59 the appearance of this minimum for @xmath58 suggests that it may be of use to examine an alternative classification of the series , in which we consider all terms that are of similar magnitude when @xmath60 is of order one , therefore just represents a particular way of reclassifying terms in the single - logarithmic perturbative expansion . ]",
    "@xmath61 one finds that there are only terms with @xmath62 , since lower values of @xmath63 would be associated with negative powers of @xmath44 , while higher values of @xmath63 would be super - leading in the usual ll@xmath0classification . in other words the two terms , @xmath52 and @xmath64 , that we have examined so far provide the full leading contribution for @xmath65 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : table ] , which shows various possible classifications of logarithmically enhanced terms .",
    "rows correspond to a given power of @xmath3 ; columns to a given single - logarithmic order ( ll@xmath0 , nll@xmath0 , and so on ) ; terms on a same downward going diagonal line ( reading from left to right ) all have the same power of @xmath57 .    ' indicates terms that could have been present but are zero ; ` @xmath32 ' indicates a term whose only non - vanishing part is proportional to @xmath32 ; a dash indicates terms which do not exist by definition.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    terms on upward going diagonal lines in figure  [ fig : table ] are of the same order for @xmath66 . on any given such diagonal ,",
    "the number of terms is always finite , due to the fact that the natural hierarchy is single logarithmic .",
    "the leading terms in this regime , discussed above in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlclass ] ) , are highlighted by the upper ( upward - going diagonal ) ellipse .",
    "the lower ellipse contains terms suppressed insofar as they have one less power of @xmath44 , @xmath67 equivalently , since we are interested in the region where @xmath68 , these terms are suppressed by a power of @xmath5 . adding the terms of the lower ellipse to eq .",
    "( [ eq : firstterms ] ) one obtains @xmath69 where we have exploited the fact that @xmath70 and that the @xmath71 contribution can be absorbed into the constant piece . solving for the minimum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pggwitha42 ] ) gives @xmath72 where the numerical values have been given for @xmath73 .",
    "we see that the effect of the subleading @xmath30 term is to shift @xmath74 by a ( rather large ) constant .    as well as",
    "considering the position of the dip , it is interesting to study also its depth , @xmath75 . substituting @xmath76 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : firstterms ] ) one immediately sees that the dip s depth is of order @xmath77 .",
    "including the subleading terms ( lower ellipse of figure  [ fig : table ] ) gives the following result @xmath78 the depth has been defined with respect to the @xmath79 limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pggwitha42 ] ) , which includes the usual @xmath80 constant term , but also @xmath81 term and the unknown nnll@xmath0term @xmath82 .",
    "the full @xmath2 splitting function has of course a @xmath83 divergence so its @xmath79 value can not actually be used as a reference point for defining the depth .",
    "so one may choose to define it alternatively with respect to the value of the @xmath84 lo splitting function , @xmath54 .",
    "this introduces extra terms @xmath85 in the expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pggdepth ] ) , for @xmath86 .    model of  @xcite compared to our analytical predictions .",

    "see text for details.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the dip position and depth , as a function of @xmath80 , are shown respectively in figures  [ fig : dipprop]a and [ fig : dipprop]b . in each case",
    "the solid line represents the dip properties as ` measured ' from the nll@xmath35schemescheme accounts only partially for the @xmath32 dependence ( that associated with running of the coupling ) , the resulting nll@xmath0@xmath87 coefficients differ slightly from those shown in eq .",

    "( [ eq : bcoeffs ] ) ( in @xmath30 the @xmath32-part in the @xmath89-dependent term is retained , hence the coefficient of @xmath32 in @xmath30 is @xmath90 ) .",
    "the reason for the only partial inclusion of the @xmath32 dependence is that the nll@xmath35 scheme is based on a single - channel , purely gluonic approach , whereas full account of @xmath32 dependence would require a two - channel , quark - gluon formulation .",
    "] of  @xcite , which was shown also in figure  [ fig : pgg ] .",
    "the shaded band represents the spread of the predictions based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pggwitha42])([eq : pggdepth ] ) .",
    "the upper edge of the bands , labelled ` quadratic solution ' corresponds to the use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xminsln ] ) and its direct substitution into eq .",
    "( [ eq : pggwitha42 ] ) ; the lower edge corresponds to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xminnl ] ) and ( [ eq : pggdepth ] ) . for small values of @xmath3",
    ", there is rather good agreement between the expanded forms of our predictions and the dip properties as measured from the full resummation : the dip position is within the uncertainty band , typically close to the expanded solution ; the depth is just outside the uncertainty band ( again closer to the expanded solution ) , though this may be because we have measured the depth with respect to the @xmath91 reference level and have not included the resulting additional unknown nnll@xmath0@xmath71 contribution to the depth . instead , including the @xmath71",
    "as it appears in the nll@xmath35model , lowers the band so that it overlaps with the measured depth . leaving aside these details , for both the position and depth of the dip ,",
    "the scaling with @xmath3 is clearly reproduced , providing strong evidence that the dip truly is a consequence of the low - order behaviour of the perturbation series .",
    "we note though that the spread of predictions , based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xminsln ] ) and ( [ eq : xminnl ] ) , is quite significant .",
    "this is essentially due to the large value of the @xmath30 coefficient , which means that the series in @xmath5 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xminnl ] ) and ( [ eq : pggdepth ] ) is very poorly convergent  the leading and subleading corrections are of the same order when @xmath92@xmath93 .    in practice",
    "our low - order arguments seem to extend somewhat further , providing a reasonable description of the dip , within the large uncertainties , up to @xmath94 .",
    "however beyond this point the prediction fails quite dramatically , with the height of the predicted dip minimum becoming for example negative ( @xmath95 ) , in contradiction with the full resummed results .",
    "furthermore there is a clear change in the @xmath3 dependence for both the measured position and depth of the dip .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath96 the dip description can no - longer be founded on low - order perturbation theory alone .",
    "on the other hand we know that when @xmath3 is moderate and @xmath44 is sizeable we enter the usual regime of resummation of terms @xmath97  @xcite , together with its subleading corrections  @xcite . though the strict ll@xmath0 , nll@xmath0hierarchy is ill - behaved , the inclusion of renormalisation group effects tends to stabilise this hierarchy ( e.g.  @xcite ) . as a result one obtains the usual , expected behaviour of a splitting function that increases as a power of @xmath0 at small @xmath0 .",
    "a simple estimate of the @xmath0 value for which this increase occurs can be obtained in the approximation of a frozen coupling using the quadratic expansion of the effective bfkl characteristic function @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the value of @xmath100 at its minimum , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is related to the second derivative of @xmath103 ( see figures  1 and 3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the well - known square - root branch - point for the anomalous dimension , @xmath104 and to the representation @xmath105 for the splitting function .",
    "it is amusing to note that the above estimate shows a dip at @xmath106 due to the logarithmic prefactor .",
    "of course the actual cut structure of the anomalous dimension is much more complicated , showing a variety of subleading branch cuts , generally at complex @xmath107 values  @xcite , which are needed to match the small-@xmath0 representation ( [ eq : branchrep ] ) to perturbation theory for small @xmath36 .",
    "for this reason the dip structure ( [ eq : omsdip ] ) , based on the moderate-@xmath0 behaviour of ( [ eq : branchrep ] ) is not always to be taken seriously.splitting function has no dip at all .",
    "it is interesting also to note that ll evolution with ( subleading ) running coupling corrections does have a dip @xcite  its small-@xmath3 properties are different from those of the full nll@xmath0 dip , because it is due to an interplay between terms @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) and so , in the limit of small @xmath3 occurs for @xmath44 of order @xmath37 .",
    "a related running - coupling llx dip has been obtained in @xcite , though the different scale of the running coupling and the use of the airy extrapolation mean that it has different formal small-@xmath80 properties from @xcite .",
    "] however , in our resummed calculation , the existence of the dip relies on the negative @xmath44-slope of the splitting function which is pretty well represented by the @xmath5-expansion , as noticed before .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath110 , eq .  ( [ eq : branchrep ] ) is a reasonable representation of the splitting function and in cases  as ours  in which there is a dip , we can take eq .",
    "( [ eq : omsdip ] ) as an _ upper bound _ on its position .    in the running - coupling case",
    "it is to be kept in mind that the cut is actually broken up into a series of poles , the leading one being at a position @xmath111 which lies somewhat below @xmath99 ( see figure 18 of  @xcite ) because of running coupling effects .",
    "nevertheless , as long as @xmath0 is not too small , the inverse mellin transform ( [ eq : branchrep ] ) does not resolve the difference between a cut and series of poles .    therefore , by joining the @xmath5-expansion with the cut - representation arguments , we are led to believe that the perturbative and resummed regions can be matched by the inequality @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : xminnl ] ) , and we have replaced @xmath115 with @xmath116 . since the right - hand expression goes as @xmath117 , this equation provides a transition point in @xmath80 , below which one should use the perturbative ( double - logarithmic ) representation described before , and above which one should use the full resummed behaviour .",
    "this is confirmed by the moderate @xmath80 region of figure  [ fig : dipprop]a , where one sees a clear bend in the behaviour of @xmath74 when @xmath118 becomes of the same order as the perturbative representation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xminnl ] ) , with the measured @xmath74 remaining consistently below @xmath118 .",
    "the arguments provided in this letter go some way towards explaining the features of the dip for a range of @xmath3 values , both in terms of a perturbative series in powers of @xmath5 for small @xmath3 , and in terms of a resummed upper bound of the dip position , @xmath119 , for moderate values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is the moderate-@xmath3 region that remains the least well understood , the matching of the small-@xmath0 increase to the initial decrease being a quite non - trivial problem .",
    "for example the simple resummed treatment given above is subject to additional running - coupling effects ( e.g.  difference between @xmath120 and @xmath115 ) which may contribute further displacement of the dip and which have not been considered here .",
    "nevertheless , the arguments given so far show that the dip does exist , as a moderately small-@xmath0 phenomenon , under the simple condition that the small-@xmath0 part of @xmath12 has initially a negative @xmath44 slope , as is the case starting at nnlo .",
    "an important phenomenological point that remains to be made concerns the validity of fixed - order expansions of the splitting functions . from our analysis of the dip properties ,",
    "it is clear that for @xmath121 one starts to see a breakdown of the perturbative expansion . despite this fact one notes a remarkable property of figure  [ fig : pgg ] , namely that the pure nnlo expansion of the splitting function coincides rather well with the resummed result up to the position of the dip minimum  considerably beyond the point in @xmath0 where",
    "one would have naively expected the @xmath49 dglap terms to completely change the behaviour of the splitting function .",
    "this holds for a wide range of @xmath3 .",
    "we can not claim to have fully understood this observation , however it does suggest that it may in general be safe to use the fixed order , nnlo , @xmath122 splitting function down to @xmath0 values corresponding to the dip position , and only beyond this point will small-@xmath0 resummation be strictly necessary . thus one can use the ` measured ' dip position , the solid curve of figure  [ fig : dipprop]a , as an estimate of the limit of validity of the nnlo expansion at small @xmath0 . considering this in the context of the available @xmath14 data",
    ", one sees that the limit cuts through the hera kinematical range , suggesting that while much of the data will be in the region that is ` safe ' for an nnlo analysis , there is also a substantial region at lower @xmath0 and @xmath123 in which resummation will be needed .",
    "we wish to thank guido altarelli and stefano forte for several stimulating discussions on the subject of small-@xmath0 splitting functions .",
