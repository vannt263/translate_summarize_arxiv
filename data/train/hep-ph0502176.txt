    "the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the planck scale is one of the most puzzling aspects of the standard model ( sm ) . on the one hand ,",
    "allowing the cutoff scale of the sm to be the planck scale allows us to naturally understand both the stability of the proton and the smallness of the neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "an enormous fine - tuning is required to prevent the higgs mass from being destabilized by radiative corrections proportional to the cutoff scale .",
    "our options appear to be to either live with fine - tuning ( for example @xcite ) or find a dynamical solution that may well affect the successes of the standard model with a high cutoff scale .",
    "the most dramatic solution to the hierarchy problem is to lower the cutoff scale of the sm close to the weak scale . in scenarios with large or warped extra dimensions @xcite , the cutoff scale of the sm is the fundamental scale of quantum gravity .",
    "all global symmetries are expected to be violated by quantum gravity effects , in particular baryon and lepton number are violated leading to extremely rapid proton decay and way - too - large majorana neutrino masses .",
    "there are intrinsically extra dimensional solutions to these problems @xcite , for example , by separating fermions within a fat brane .",
    "the solution to the too - large majorana neutrino mass problem , however , requires more structure beyond fermion geography .",
    "is gauged in the bulk .",
    "the needed geography is to separate left - handed neutrinos from right - handed neutrinos from u(1)@xmath1 breaking fields in the extra dimensional space",
    ". it also requires additional scalar fields with suitable profiles to stabilize the positions of the fermions .",
    "furthermore , the smallest cutoff scale must be parametrically larger than the inverse distance separating left - handed and right - handed leptons to ensure the wave - function overlaps are sufficiently small . ]    in this paper we consider simple , four - dimensional solutions to the problems of baryon and lepton number violation .",
    "our proposals are applicable to models of large extra dimensions , as well as any other model that lowers the cutoff scale of the sm , violating the global symmetries .",
    "we propose to avoid those problems by imposing new gauge symmetries in the effective theory that forbid the dangerous operators .",
    "baryon number and lepton number violation are eliminated ( up to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) by imposing a gauged @xmath4 baryon number and a gauged @xmath5 lepton number .",
    "similar gauged discrete symmetries were employed in @xcite .",
    "gauging discrete baryon number eliminates the proton decay problem . gauging discrete lepton number causes the neutrinos of the sm to be massless .",
    "since the cutoff scale is low , we lose the usual seesaw mechanism as an explanation for the smallness of neutrinos masses . here",
    "we will consider two models to generate neutrino masses of the experimentally observed size .",
    "the first is to break @xmath5 lepton number by a small amount , generating small majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the second is to introduce right - handed neutrinos and a new u(1 ) gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken at a scale deep in the infrared , generating small dirac neutrino masses .",
    "we subject our models to severe experimental , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints and demarcate the regions of parameter space that survive .",
    "remarkably , despite the presence of a new scalars and/or a gauge boson with mass well below the electroweak scale , we find these models provide viable solutions to the problems of baryon and lepton number violation from low cutoff scale operators .",
    "the models we present are similar to those in refs .",
    "@xcite , in that neutrino mass originates from a symmetry breaking at low scales , and hence a phase transition at late times .",
    "there is , however , an important difference .",
    "while they have focused on nearly massless pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons due to spontaneously broken global symmetries , we insist on all symmetries to be gauged and we do not have any nearly massless bosons . therefore , in general , the phenomenological constraints are correspondingly quite different .",
    "we note that models with a low cutoff scale based on discrete symmetries , but without dynamics in the infrared regime we consider , have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce flavor - blind discrete gauge symmetries that ensure the absence of too - rapid proton decay and majorana neutrino masses . in section [ sec : majorana ] , we break the discrete gauge symmetry spontaneously and induce the majorana neutrino masses at the required size . we show that the constraints from the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) as well as the neutrinoless double beta decay with an additional scalar emission are marginal .",
    "the network of domain walls is an inevitable prediction , which naturally satisfies the constraint from cosmic microwave anisotropy and can be a candidate for dark energy .",
    "we discuss the dirac case in section [ sec : dirac ] .",
    "we first show that an additional discrete gauge symmetry can suppress the dirac neutrino mass , but the predicted domain wall network requires a high cutoff scale .",
    "we then focus on a new continuous gauge symmetry , which necessarily predicts a new very light gauge boson , and show that all laboratory , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints can be satisfied .",
    "finally we comment on the hierarchy between the neutrino mass scale and the fundamental scale in section [ sec : hierarchy ] , and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the most pressing problems of lowering the cutoff scale in the sm are fast proton decay and too large majorana neutrino masses .",
    "we propose a set of two discrete symmetries ; the sm quarks transform under one symmetry , and leptons transform under the other . here",
    ", we have assumed that the chiral fermion content is the same as in the minimal sm .",
    "the discrete symmetries are assumed to be flavor - blind ( although we comment on a non - flavor - blind variation that suppresses @xmath6 in appendix [ alternative - appendix ] . ) . to ensure that the gauged discrete symmetries are not badly broken at the electroweak scale , the higgs is taken to be neutral .",
    "allowing ordinary yukawa couplings enforces the conditions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this leaves us with    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     forbids not only majorana masses for neutrinos , but also the flavor - changing lepton decay @xmath9 .",
    "majorana neutrino masses with arbitrary flavor mixing can be generated with two fields @xmath10 with charges @xmath11 that acquire vevs and spontaneously break the @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the process @xmath13 also reappears , but now further suppressed by @xmath14 . while we find this an amusing option , we adopt the flavor - blind @xmath15 in the body of the paper .",
    "in this appendix , we show that there are no anomaly - free charge assignments with fewer than six neutrino species that are ( 1 ) chiral , and ( 2 ) two of the charges are the same .",
    "it is easy to show that there are no chiral charge assignments up to four neutrinos . without a loss of generality",
    ", we can always choose one of the charges to be @xmath17 . with four neutrinos ,",
    "the charges are @xmath18 .",
    "the anomaly freedom requires @xmath19 solving for @xmath20 in the first equation and substituting into the second , we find @xmath21 all solutions to this equation give vector - like charge assignments : for @xmath22 , we find @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 , we find @xmath25 . for @xmath26 , we find @xmath27 .    with five neutrino species , one can find non - trivial chiral charge assignments .",
    "there are integer solutions , such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "however , with only one higgs that breaks the @xmath30 gauge symmetry , we need at least two neutrino species to have the same charge so that both of them can acquire masses . without a loss of generality",
    ", we can normalize the charges such that two species have charge unity , @xmath31 .",
    "then the anomaly freedom requires @xmath32 substituting the solution for @xmath33 from the first equation to the second , we find @xmath34 therefore , for any choice of @xmath20 , we can always find appropriate @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "however , there are no integer solutions .",
    "the integer solutions would require that @xmath33 , @xmath35 , and @xmath20 are all rational numbers .",
    "we can always write @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are relatively prime . in order for @xmath33 and @xmath35 to be also rational",
    ", the argument of the square root @xmath39 must be a complete square .",
    "therefore , the numerator on the r.h.s . must be a complete square of an integer . because there is a factor of @xmath37 already",
    ", other two factors must contain a factor of @xmath37",
    ". however , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 are relatively prime with @xmath37 because @xmath38 is relatively prime with @xmath37 .",
