    "the broadband colours of galaxies reveal information about the ages and metallicities of their stellar populations ( as well as their dust content ) .",

    "the benefits of the spectroscopic approach include a cleaner separation of the correlated age and metallicity effects @xcite and , in the case of the lick indices , a global insensitivity to dust reddening @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic stellar population studies demand some appreciable trade - offs compared to colour - based analyses however , such as smaller sample sizes and shallower depths .",
    "colours then offer the most efficient means to simultaneously obtain deep radially - resolved and representative stellar population information for large numbers of galaxies .    through comparison with stellar population models",
    ", galaxies colour gradients may be decomposed into corresponding gradients of age and metallicity .",
    "the latter data provide a record of the build - up of galaxies stellar contents and so are naturally of great value to galaxy formation and evolution models . in modelling galaxy colours , a wide and well - sampled wavelength baseline ( i.e. , ultraviolet , uv , to infrared ; * ?",
    "* ) is certainly desirable , not only to better constrain the fits , but also to overcome the age - metallicity degeneracy which plagues optical stellar population studies @xcite .",
    "although the availability of space - based imaging ( i.e. , galex ) has provided a much desired wavelength expansion of colour - based studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the use of optical and near - infrared ( nir ) data alone already goes a long way towards overcoming the above degeneracy @xcite .",
    "radially - resolved studies of galaxy colours abound in the literature . for giant gas - poor galaxies ( e / s0 ) , the consensus seems to be that they possess negative colour gradients @xcite , the cause of which is popularly attributed to an outward decrease in stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "positive uv and optical colour gradients found in both local and high-@xmath3 e / s0 s @xcite , however , imply that centralized star formation has recently occurred , thereby arguing for at least a partial age gradient contribution .    discerning the nature of spiral galaxies colour gradients",
    "is inherently complicated due to the presence of dust , gas , and multiple stellar populations within them @xcite .",
    "this complexity may be lifted though by distinguishing between early- and late - type spirals , wherein the former have flat or negative colour gradients @xcite while the latter are described by positive colour gradients , but with a wide dispersion @xcite .",
    "given such a variety , it is not surprising that spiral galaxies colour gradients have often been ascribed to both age and metallicity effects , with dust making a second - order or altogether negligible contribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; however , see @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , the colour gradients amongst the remaining galaxy types are more uniform than those found in spirals .",
    "that is , both peculiar and ( gas - rich and gas - poor ) dwarf galaxies are typically described by positive colour gradients @xcite .",
    "since the notion of such galaxies having a higher metallicity in their outskirts ( where the potential is weaker ) seems highly counter - intuitive , these colour gradients have commonly been attributed to underlying positive age gradients within them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "negative metallicity gradients , on the other hand , may very well contribute to the flat and negative colour gradients that have been observed within a minority of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "aside from the typical colour gradient for each principal morphological type , the structural or environmental parameters which correlate with galaxies colours and colour gradients are also of interest to understanding galaxy formation .",
    "the most prevalent of such correlations for all galaxy types are those against luminosity @xcite , mass @xcite , colour @xcite , and size @xcite , in the sense that more luminous , more massive , redder , and larger galaxies have reddest colours and flattest colour gradients .",
    "in addition , spiral galaxies have bluer colours and steeper colour gradients for lower surface brightnesses @xcite and larger contents @xcite .",
    "less uniformity has been found amongst galaxy types with respect to the environmental dependence of their colour information , however . while the colour gradients of gas - poor giants flatten @xcite and the colours of gas - rich dwarfs redden @xcite towards high densities , no corresponding trends have been found amongst spiral galaxies @xcite .    despite the seemingly coherent picture presented above based upon piecemeal information , a homogeneous analysis of galaxy colours and colour gradients across all galaxy types which incorporates nir data would enable a valuable confirmation of that picture .",
    "thus , we present here the resolved optical and optical - nir colours of a sample of virgo cluster galaxies that spans the full range in galaxy morphology . this paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we discuss the salient aspects and organisation of our photometric database .",
    "broadband colour gradients , as well as morphological , structural , and environmental trends with galaxy colours are shown and discussed in the context of previous work in .",

    "a systematic study of the colours and stellar populations within galaxies of all types demands as complete a volume - limited sample as possible .",
    "given that the virgo cluster is the closest large concentration of galaxies whose members span the full range of galaxian parameter space , we use for our study the radially - resolved @xmath4 photometric database derived from the imaging survey of virgo galaxies of mcdonald et  al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter m11 ) . only those aspects of m11 which are relevant to our study are discussed below ; further details can be found in m11 .",
    "the m11 sample includes 285 galaxies selected from the virgo cluster catalog ( * ? ? ?",

    "the m11 sample extends out to the 6@xmath9 radius of the virgo cluster @xcite , such that the sample spans a wide range in environmental conditions ( i.e. , galaxy densities @xmath10 3@xmath1116 mpc@xmath12 and gas deficiencies @xmath13 -0.4@xmath112.3 dex ; see . as seen in m11",
    ", a natural bias for gas - poor galaxies exists in the sample given the morphology - density relation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the m11 sample contains 86 gas - rich galaxies ( 56 giants and 30 dwarfs ; see table [ tbl : cgrd ] ) , thereby allowing for meaningful comparisons of the colours , and thus stellar populations , between major virgo galaxy types .",
    "radially - resolved optical ( @xmath14 ) photometry for the m11 galaxies was extracted from sdss imaging .",
    "however , the @xmath15- and @xmath3-bands were excluded from our analysis in light of their low signal - to - noise ( hereafter @xmath16 ) and the significant number of light profiles having obvious sky subtraction errors at those wavelengths ( m11 ) .",
    "the m11 nir photometry came from a mixture of imaging sources , including the goldmine ( * ? ? ?",
    "* galaxies ) and two micron all - sky survey ( * ? ? ?",

    "the spatial extent of the nir light profiles is , on average , @xmath060% that of the corresponding @xmath18-band profiles for @xmath0200 galaxies ( see for our definition of profile extent ) , while the optical and nir profiles reach median surface brightness levels of @xmath19 26.5  and @xmath20 23 , respectively .",
    "the high quality of the m11 light profiles enables a reliable investigation of virgo galaxies colours out to typically large galactocentric radii .      the @xmath4 major - axis surface brightness ( hereafter sb ) profiles of virgo galaxies",
    "were extracted by m11 with the astronomical image - processing software xvista . to ensure that colour gradients are computed homogeneously , the sdss sb profiles were degraded to the ( poorer ) resolution of the nir profiles .",
    "we have also drawn upon the collection of non - parametric , @xmath17-band structural parameters presented in @xcite to search for possible correlations between galaxy colour and structure .",
    "the structural parameters of interest include effective surface brightnesses ( @xmath21 ) , effective radii ( @xmath22 ) , concentrations ( @xmath23 ) and apparent magnitudes ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "these non - parametric diagnostics all involve the extrapolation and integration of galaxies nir light profiles to infinity .",
    "we use the nir values of the above structural diagnostics for their lower sensitivity to dust attenuation and greater sensitivity to the galaxy stellar masses .      to probe for an environmental dependence in the virgo galaxy colours",
    ", we characterize the impact of environment with the neutral hydrogen deficiency parameter , @xmath25 . for a cluster galaxy with a given gas mass @xmath26 , @xmath27 - @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the typical mass for field galaxies of the same hubble type , @xmath30 , and optical diameter , @xmath31 , such that positive @xmath25 values correspond to a dearth of neutral gas .",
    "the advantage of @xmath25 as a measure of galaxy environment is its independence of projection effects that plague other traditional ( 2d ) diagnostics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s02 ) . for completeness",
    ", we still appeal to the ( projected ) cluster - centric distances , @xmath32 , and local surface densities of the m11 galaxies , @xmath33 , to assist our study of environmental effects on their colours .",
    "cluster - centric distances were computed relative to m87 while assuming a common distance to all vcc galaxies of 16.5 mpc @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite in computing @xmath33 as the number density comprised by the ten nearest vcc neighbours to a given galaxy s position .",
    "we obtained @xmath25 measurements for m11 galaxies from s02 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kk04 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g05 ) .",
    "the latter compilation is the most complete , providing mass measurements for 91 of the 115 gas - rich galaxies in the m11 sample , as well as an additional 10 e / s0 systems .",
    "the other mass compilations have @xmath25 determinations for 28 ( kk04 ) and 53 ( s02 ) galaxies , only four of which are not included in g05 .",
    "we compare @xmath25 measurements in for galaxies in common for kk04 and g02 with s02 , with the red line in each plot denoting equality .",
    "while there is good consistency between the kk04 and s02 databases ( @xmath34 = 0.97 ; @xmath35 = 0.11 dex ) , the measurements of g05 are systematically higher on average than the others , regardless of morphology . presuming that the g05 measurements are at least internally consistent , we rely strictly on that database for @xmath25 values .      prior to measuring virgo galaxy colours and stellar populations",
    ", the m11 sb profiles require special attention , which we now describe .",
    "the computation of accurate galaxy colour profiles relies on accounting for pixels that are spoiled by either foreground stars , scattered light , or low @xmath16 . to correct for this , we first truncated the m11 sb profiles by searching outward in each of them for a sequence of adjacent isophotes with sb errors in excess of a given threshold @xmath36 .",
    "the isophotes beyond that point were flagged as unreliable and their location marked as the truncation radius .    in the truncation process , we used error thresholds of 0.25 and 0.20 for the m11 optical and nir sb profiles , respectively .",
    "these values correspond to locations in the sb profiles where the point - to - point scatter becomes comparable to the statistical errors per isophote .",
    "these thresholds are also roughly equal to 0.1 - 0.2% of the sky level ( or less ) in each profile .",
    "we have also applied an adaptive radial binning scheme to the m11 sb profiles to increase the @xmath16 per radial bin . while previous studies of galaxy colour gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) used an incremental radial binning scheme , ours requires that a minimum signal - to - noise @xmath37 be met in all four bands in a given bin .",
    "since an incremental scheme makes no such stipulation and typically has larger radial bins , the colour profiles of individual galaxies will then tend to extend further in this scheme than those determined from our adaptive scheme .",
    "however , these increased depths are overshadowed by the higher colour dispersions per radial bin and the inclusion of low @xmath16 data points in galaxies outskirts , thereby decreasing the quality of the colour profiles overall .    accounting only for the poisson noise of the source and sky ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath16 per isophote according to , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the isophote s sb and sky background , respectively , and @xmath41 is its circumference .",
    "the radial binning scheme for each galaxy is based on the sb profile with the lowest overall @xmath16 ; the latter usually corresponds to the @xmath42-band , followed by the @xmath17-band .",
    "we enforce a minimum bin size for each galaxy , which is set by the maximum seeing disk amongst all bands and most often corresponds to the @xmath17-band value .",
    "the sb of a bin is determined by a weighted average of the isophotal sbs that it contains , while the bin location is set to its midpoint . through extensive testing",
    ", we have found that using the @xmath43 median trends determined from the original photometry provided the most reliable way of estimating the sb error per bin .",
    "lastly , we have carried out our analysis for the cases of @xmath37 = 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 per bin .",
    "the determination of accurate colour gradients for a galaxy demands reliable subtraction of the sky s contribution to the flux measured within each filter .",
    "an under- or over - estimated sky in a given band will artificially increase or decrease the corresponding sb measured in a galaxy s outskirts , respectively , thereby skewing its colour profiles .",
    "sky errors dominate all other error sources in the study of galaxy colours @xcite . while m11 took great care in assessing sky level corrections , our profile truncation algorithm ( )",
    "is already effective before the sky error envelopes become prohibitively large ( i.e. , @xmath44 0.2% of the sky level ) .",
    "we revisit the issue of sky errors in .",
    "we now consider the broadband colour profiles of virgo galaxies , as well as seek out possible morphological , structural and environmental trends in their central colours .",
    "these data offer a view of stellar populations both within and amongst galaxies , free of any assumptions about their underlying star formation histories and chemical evolution .",
    "the wide frequency baseline of the @xmath42-@xmath17 colour provides us with our best constraint on the broad spectral shapes of virgo galaxies , and thus on their stellar populations .",
    "the median @xmath42-@xmath17 profiles and rms dispersions for virgo galaxies of different morphologies are shown in by the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "for this exercise , the @xmath42-@xmath17 colour profile for each galaxy was created by subtracting its binned @xmath17-band light profile from its binned @xmath42-band light profile .",
    "we also scaled each colour profile according to the nir effective radius of the galaxy , thereby removing the size variation that exists amongst galaxies of various hubble types .",
    "given our imposed @xmath16 constraints , we find that the median colour profiles for the many virgo galaxy types span a large range , extending out to @xmath06 @xmath45 for the gas - poor giants , down to @xmath462 @xmath45 for the gas - rich dwarfs and irregulars .    as a complement to",
    ", we list in table [ tbl : cgrd ] the relevant colour information for each morphological group ( column 1 ) . columns",
    "2 - 4 contain the median @xmath42-@xmath17 colour gradients , where the gradient for each galaxy was measured from a linear fit to the @xmath42-@xmath17 profile .",
    "the gradients were computed for three choices of radial coordinate , so that the median gradients could be expressed either in terms of scaled ( @xmath45 ; column 2 ) or physical radii ( the latter were computed on both a linear and logarithmic scale ; columns 3 - 4 ) .",
    "column 5 shows the median @xmath42-@xmath17 central colours , while column 6 provides the number of galaxies in each morphological group .",
    "both the central colours and colour gradients for each of our galaxies , along with their surface brightness profiles and bulge - disk decompositions , are available at the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg and our own website .    in fitting galaxies colour profiles",
    ", we neglected the first radial bin in order to avoid adverse psf blurring effects from skewing our computed gradients .",
    "we show in the size of the first radial bin versus the fwhm of the maximum seeing disk for all virgo galaxies .",
    "the proximity of many galaxies to the line of equality ( red ) indicates that seeing effects within the first bin of the colour profiles for those systems are likely non - negligible .",
    "other effects which could potentially skew the median colour gradient estimates provided in table [ tbl : cgrd ] include the use of a variable radial range in individual colour profile fits ( given our choice of binning scheme ) and of different @xmath47 values in adaptively binning the m11 sb profiles . as shown in figures [ fig : fxdvsvar ] and [ fig : sn10vssn50 ] though , neither of these two effects presents a significant risk towards the robustness of our colour gradient determinations .",
    "examination of table [ tbl : cgrd ] reveals a large dispersion in the colour gradient distribution of each virgo galaxy type",
    ". these dispersions may be either intrinsic to virgo cluster galaxies , or largely the result of measurement errors in their sb profiles . as mentioned in ,",
    "imperfect sky subtraction is the largest source of error in the computation of galaxy colour gradients",
    ". we can estimate the impact of sky errors on those gradients through the @xmath481@xmath49 error envelopes for each m11 sb profile , where @xmath49 is the standard deviation in the sky levels measured in boxes along the periphery of a given virgo galaxy image .",
    "we assess the colour gradient error by calculating the extrema of this quantity based on sky error envelopes .",
    "the distribution of errors in the @xmath42-@xmath17 colour gradients of virgo galaxies due to imperfect sky subtractions is shown in . comparing with table [ tbl : cgrd ]",
    ", it can be seen that median sky errors contribute no more than @xmath016% of the dispersion found in the colour gradient distribution of each galaxy type ; those dispersions are thus largely intrinsic to each galaxy population .",
    "it is reassuring that the distribution of the median colour gradients listed in table [ tbl : cgrd ] accurately reflects our impressions from , which we now describe than that which comprises the interiors ] . collectively , the median @xmath42-@xmath17 profiles of virgo galaxies exhibit intriguing features .",
    "first , most galaxy types ( de / ds0 , sa@xmath11sd , i m , ? ) are described by a negative colour gradient , albeit of differing strengths .",
    "the gas - poor e / s0 s , sdm+sm spirals , star - forming bcds , and morphologically - peculiar s ?",
    "galaxy types , on the other hand , have either quasi - flat ( e / s0 , sdm+sm , bcd ) or positive ( s ? ) colour gradients .",
    "this variation in the @xmath42-@xmath17 gradients of virgo galaxies seems to correlate with morphology , such that the gradient is more negative for later hubble types , as seen elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the large dispersions reported in table [ tbl : cgrd ] might draw suspicion on such a claim , comparisions of the gradient distributions for neighbouring morphologies via the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test confirms that the probability that any two distributions come from the same parent does not exceed @xmath040% .    on its own ,",
    "our detected morphological trend in the median colour gradients of virgo galaxies might seem surprising as previous studies of galaxy colours have failed to reveal the existence of such gradient ( i.e. , positive / negative ) for most galaxy types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dispersions in table  [ tbl : cgrd ] show , however , that the colour gradient distribution for each virgo galaxy type encompasses both positive and negative values , confirming that the variety in colour gradient sign found previously is reproduced here .",
    "late - type spirals , on the other hand , have been shown by @xcite as having a robust ( positive ) colour gradient sign , which , interestingly enough , is contrary to the typically negative gradient that we find for virgo scd@xmath11sm spirals .",
    "this discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that taylor et al .",
    "used uv - optical colours , which are quite sensitive to the ongoing star formation that is likely occurring within these gas - rich galaxies .    also interesting from table",
    "[ tbl : cgrd ] is the variation of the colour gradient dispersion amongst major galaxy types .",
    "for instance , the ( rms ) dispersion ( in @xmath45 space ) for the virgo gas - poor giants and spirals is @xmath00.21 and @xmath00.36 , respectively .",
    "the irregulars have intermediate values .",
    "this result agrees with the significant scatter in both the colours and colour gradients of spiral galaxies that has been reported by many @xcite .",
    "the large colour ranges spanned by both virgo spirals and irregulars may reflect a large variance in their stellar population properties due to their ongoing star formation .",
    "dust attenuation may also be affecting these galaxies colours , especially since the m11 sample contains a few unrealistically red ( @xmath42-@xmath20 4 - 5 ) sa@xmath11sd galaxies ( see ) . whether the role of dust in setting galaxy colours is statistically important or not will be revisited in .",
    "in addition to the collective properties and trends noted above , inspection of the median colour profiles amongst major virgo galaxy types reveals other noteworthy results .",
    "for instance , within their respective errors , the profiles for the two gas - poor giant types ( e / s0 ) are remarkably similar ; both exhibit a relatively constant colour ( @xmath42-@xmath20 3.2 ) out to @xmath04 @xmath45 , beyond which they become redder with radius .",
    "this suggests that virgo e / s0 s possess similar stellar populations and likely share a similar ( extended ) formation history ; this idea is explored further in paper ii . on the other hand , and table  [ tbl : cgrd ]",
    "remind us that virgo gas - poor dwarfs are systematically bluer and have more negative colour gradients than the gas - poor giants .",
    "indeed , ks tests of the colour gradient distributions for virgo gas - poor dwarfs and giants only have a @xmath07% probability of having a common parent distribution .",
    "the colour gradients that we have found for virgo gas - poor dwarfs are consistent with these galaxies being less enriched overall than virgo gas - poor giants ( @xcite ; @xcite ; paper ii ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare our optical - nir colour gradient estimates with literature values for other galaxies . @xcite",
    "measured d(@xmath42-@xmath17)/dlog(r / r@xmath50 ) colour gradients in 4546 giant gas - poor galaxies that overlap with both the sdss and 2mass to find a strongly negative mean value and large dispersion for them : @xmath51 mag / dex .",
    "the combined @xmath42-@xmath17 colour gradient distribution for our virgo e and s0 galaxies , equal to @xmath52 mag / dex , agrees well with la  barbera s result .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the g - k colour gradient distribution for a smaller sample of nearby giant gas - poor galaxies by @xcite has also yielded a mean value similar to ours ( -0.29 mag / dex ) .    with respect to gas - rich dwarf galaxies",
    ", @xcite analysed the @xmath53-@xmath54 colour gradients in both magellanic irregulars and blue compact dwarfs and found that the mean colour gradient for these two galaxy types is -0.07 and + 0.90 mag / kpc , respectively . while the mean @xmath42-@xmath17 colour gradient that we have estimated for virgo i m galaxy types ( -0.11 mag / kpc ) agrees well with the former , that for virgo bcds ( + 0.11 mag / kpc ) is much flatter .",
    "this discrepancy is reduced when we consider the fact that the standard deviations about both mean values is large ( 1.129 and 0.318 mag / kpc , respectively ) and that both distributions suffer from small sample sizes ( n = 5 and 8 , respectively ) .",
    "lastly , @xcite studied the @xmath55-@xmath56 colour gradients for spiral galaxies of all types .",
    "although a quantitative comparison of fuv-@xmath56 and @xmath42-@xmath17 colours and colour gradients seems ill - conceived for any galaxy type , it is interesting to note that the median fuv - k colour gradient in these authors sample decreases , albeit weakly , from early- to late - type spirals ( -0.015 mag kpc@xmath57 for sa@xmath11sb s to -0.040 mag kpc@xmath57 for scd+sd s ) ; their sdm+sm spirals do not follow this trend , however , having a nearly flat median gradient of -0.005 mag kpc@xmath57 .",

    "note that both the model predictions and reddening vector discussed above have been included in figures  [ fig : cc - struct]-[fig : cc - ba ] as well .",
    "figures  [ fig : cc - etg]-[fig : cc - sp ] show that the different virgo galaxy types have unique colour profile combinations , and thus stellar contents .",
    "the colour profiles of the gas - poor systems ( figures  [ fig : cc - etg]-[fig : cc - s0-irr ] ) suggest that their stellar populations are old ( @xmath619 gyr ) and span a wide range in metallicity ; that is , these colour gradients are largely explained as a metallicity effect @xcite , while age variations make a secondary , but non - negligible , contribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "the systematic differences in the median colour profiles between the virgo gas - poor giants and dwarfs ( ) are similarly explained by the stellar populations of the former being more metal - rich ( @xmath62 -0.25 ) , but only slightly older ( @xmath00.5 gyr ) , than the latter .",
    "interestingly , the de s and e s together define the metallicity extrema for the entire virgo gas - poor galaxy population , as opposed to the ds0 s and s0 s .",
    "the virgo irregulars ( ) show the greatest colour range amongst all of the major galaxy types in this cluster such that , collectively , their stellar populations go from being old and metal - rich to young and metal - poor .",
    "this extreme colour variation extends to the virgo irregulars as well , as their median colour profiles show that significant radial increases and decreases in age and metallicity , respectively , occur within each galaxy type .",
    "such broad population gradients make it difficult to assign typical ages and metallicities to irregular galaxies .",
    "the offsetting effect that such radial behaviours in stellar populations have on colours helps explain previous reports of flat ( or weakly positive ) optical colour gradients in irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the redder disks that have been found in dirr s relative to those in bcds @xcite may be understood by the former having older outskirts .",
    "age and metallicity gradients are also apparent within virgo spirals ( ) , but with the latter being more significant , on average , than the former .",
    "age and metallicity variations have been ascribed previously as the source of the significant colour gradients in spiral galaxies @xcite , while our claim that the implied age gradients in spirals are small is only matched by @xcite . in the median ,",
    "the metallicity gradients for all virgo spiral types appear to be uniformly negative , while their age gradients are more varied . this complex pattern of virgo spirals colour gradients thwarts any realistic estimate of typical ages and metallicities for these galaxies as well .",
    "however , the colours of virgo spirals exhibit a morphological trend , also reported elsewhere @xcite , which may be explained by the earlier galaxies being older and more enriched than the later ones .",
    "we show in the same colour - colour diagram as in ( including the same model ) but with the points differentiated according to the following structural parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath63 or @xmath45 . in these plots ,",
    "we focus on galaxy centers ( i.e. , within an aperture of 0.5 @xmath45 ) to ease the distinction of colour trends as a function of galaxy structure .",
    "we also indicate with error bars the median values and rms dispersions of the colour distributions for all structural parameter bins .",
    "the virgo galaxy central colours exhibit multiple trends against structural parameters .",
    "the trend versus @xmath23 suggests that the most concentrated virgo galaxies are the oldest and most metal - rich .",
    "since @xmath23 measures the shape / concentration of a galaxy s light profile , this trend essentially confirms that found above versus morphology between the virgo spheroidal and disk galaxies .",
    "the other trends , with @xmath24 and @xmath63 , indicate that the more luminous and brighter virgo galaxies tend to be older and more enriched than less luminous systems .",
    "our detection of these trends agrees with the luminosity and surface brightness dependencies of galaxy colours and colour gradients reported in numerous studies @xcite ( but see @xcite and @xcite for arguments against the luminosity dependence of gas - poor galaxies colours ) .",
    "no significant colour trend is seen against @xmath45 other than the most compact virgo galaxies being older and more metal - rich than larger ones .",
    "this null result agrees with the weak size trends in spiral galaxies colour gradients seen elsewhere @xcite , though @xcite reported a disk scale length dependence in the colour gradients of field and group dirr s .",
    "is the environmental corollary to . to investigate possible colour - environment trends ,",
    "the m11 galaxies have been assigned in each of these figures to one of four equally - populated bins in the following parameters : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or @xmath25 .",
    "we find from these plots that the median colours of the different @xmath32 and @xmath33 bins all roughly coincide , suggesting that cluster - centric location of , or local density about , a virgo galaxy has little influence on its stellar content .",
    "this result is matched by @xcite and @xcite who found no change in the colours or colour gradients of gas - rich galaxies with local density .",
    "the contradictory claim by @xcite about a density dependence of galaxy colours is diffused by considering that those authors used a sample which spanned a wider density baseline ( field@xmath64cluster ) than ours .    amongst virgo gas - rich galaxies ,",
    "we find a clean trend of colours with @xmath25 , such that more deficient systems are older and more metal - rich than less deficient ones .",
    "however , the comparable @xmath34-@xmath17 colours found amongst intermediate-@xmath25 galaxies suggest that age effects dominate over those of metallicity in creating the observed trend . to our knowledge , this is the first report of a gas deficiency - colour correlation for virgo galaxies .",
    "however , a latent correlation between the @xmath25 measurements for our galaxies and their morphology , with a pearson correlation coefficient of -0.68 , makes it unclear whether the colour-@xmath25 trend is fundamental or not",
    ".      it would also be prudent to address the effects of dust on the colour properties of virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "the presence of dust in star - forming systems is of concern in stellar population studies since reddened broadband colours may be erroneously attributed to their stellar content .",
    "for instance , the colour gradients of a galaxy with a smoothly - varying dust distribution may be taken as due to combined negative age and metallicity gradients within it , a consequence of the three - fold age - metallicity - dust degeneracy .",
    "even face - on systems may be susceptible to such effects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m04 ; paper ii ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite have shown that the shallow optical colour gradients of gas - poor giants may be explained by a diffuse dust component , while @xcite have found evidence for severe ( but localized ) dust attenuation in the optical - nir profiles of nearby spirals .    in",
    ", we assess the dust reddening of the central colours of virgo spirals in the @xmath34-@xmath17 versus @xmath42-@xmath34 plane , where individual galaxies are identified according to their nir axis ratio , @xmath65 . in so doing , we find large dispersions in the colour distributions for edge - on systems , which suggests that some of them likely suffer from significant reddening .",
    "the colour centroids of the highest and lowest inclination spirals are nearly identical , however , which is inconsistent with dust being the main driver of these galaxies central colours .",
    "that is , in a statistical sense , the effect of dust on our galaxy colours may be neglected .",
    "this conclusion finds ample support in the literature @xcite , but does not preclude a possible contribution of dust to the colour gradients of individual systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , we find dramatic colour variations between adjacent radial bins in a few virgo spirals , indicative of significant reddening at those ( redward ) locations ( i.e. , those colour variations would otherwise imply radical changes in local age and metallicity ) , but the incidence of such bins is small .",
    "by combining high - quality optical ( @xmath66 ) and near - infrared ( @xmath17 ) imaging for @xmath0300 virgo cluster galaxies , we have studied the resolved broadband colours of a representative galaxy sample spanning the full range of structural parameters .",
    "below is a summary of our main findings about virgo galaxies colour gradients and trends in their central colours with structural and environmental parameters :    * in the median , the colour gradients of virgo galaxies systematically decrease with morphological type , such that the gradients of giant early - types are nearly flat , while those of later types are strongly negative ( i.e. , red centers to blue outskirts ) .",
    "the colour gradients of early - type dwarfs are more negative than those for the giants ; * the colour gradients of all virgo galaxies principally arise from stellar metallicity gradients , while stellar age gradients contribute only to the colours of virgo irregulars ; * the central colours of virgo galaxies correlate with concentration , luminosity , and surface brightness , such that galaxies become redder with an increase in each of these parameters ; * while the central colours of virgo galaxies do not depend on cluster - centric distance or local galaxy density , those of virgo gas - rich galaxies correlate strongly with their neutral gas deficiency ; * the central colours of virgo spiral galaxies are uncorrelated with axial ratio , thus limiting the role of dust in setting their colours .    while the above results reflect on the stellar content of virgo galaxies and their structural and environmental dependencies",
    ", we can explicitly apply stellar population models to galaxy colours .",
    "this is what we do in paper ii as a way to constrain formation scenarios for the major galaxy types in the virgo cluster .",
