    "amongst the complex and varied range of plasma structures in the solar corona , active region fan loops stand out as large , long - lived structures .",
    "the loops are most distinctive when observed in emission lines formed in the narrow temperature range 0.61.0  mk , and they came to prominence when the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) satellite began regular observations in an extreme ultraviolet filter centered at 174    @xcite , picking up strong emission lines of feix and fex that are formed at 0.8 and 1.0  mk , respectively .",
    "this filter is referred to as `` trace 171 '' to be consistent with the terminology used for the earlier euv imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although in fact the filter is more sensitive to fex @xmath4174.53 @xcite . @xcite presented properties of the active region fan loops seen in the trace 171 filter which we summarize here .",
    "they are seen to terminate in the penumbra of sunspots and also in strong fields at the edges of active regions ; they show small temperature variation with height ; they can survive for hours to days ; and they show propagating intensity perturbations ( pips ) that give the impression of upflows from the surface . the latter property has been extensively studied , and the most common interpretation is that pips are due to upward - propagating , slow magnetoacoustic waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the pips are not a permanent feature of fan loops but are intermittent , lasting for typically 10 s of minutes before switching off @xcite .",
    "this work also demonstrated that individual ` strands ' within the loop can display pips independently .    prior to trace , the presence of spiky , plumelike structures at the edges of active regions had been remarked on in analyzes of _ skylab _ data . for example , @xcite identified nevii ( @xmath5  mk ) plumes close to a sunspot , while @xcite found emission `` spikes '' in nevii at the periphery of an active region , with mgix ( @xmath6  mk ) loops corresponding with nevii although the emission was more extended and less sharply defined .",
    "these structures are almost certainly the same as the trace fan loops .",
    "the first line - of - sight ( los ) velocity measurements for a fan loop were made by @xcite using the sumer ( solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ; * ? ? ? * ) instrument on board soho .",
    "a trace 171 fan loop was clearly identified in the neviii @xmath4770 emission line ( 0.7  mk ) observed by sumer and redshifts of 1540  km  s@xmath0  were measured , i.e. , plasma is downflowing in the fan loop legs .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the apparent upflows in the trace image sequences first described by @xcite , and appears to confirm the standard interpretation of the pips as due to magnetoacoustic waves rather than an upward flow of plasma .",
    "this view has been challenged more recently by @xcite who interpret the pips as quasi - periodic bursts of upflowing plasma with velocities of 50150  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the emission from this plasma is weak compared to that from bulk loop plasma , but is sufficient to give an intensity oscillation signal ( which can be detected with an imaging instrument ) , coupled with oscillations in velocity and line width .",
    "further active region velocity studies with sumer were performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former presented doppler maps for three active regions ( including that of * ? ? ? * ) and , although not specifically remarked on , it is clear that several fan loop structures ( including some close to a sunspot ) in the data display significant redshifts in neviii @xmath4770 .",
    "the loops also appear to show redshifts in civ @xmath41548 .",
    "@xcite presented doppler maps in civ @xmath41548 , sv @xmath4786 and neviii @xmath4770 ( formed at 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.7  mk , respectively ) for an active region and two `` plumelike '' structures ( almost certainly the same as fan loops ) were shown to exhibit redshifts of 510  km  s@xmath0  in sv and neviii although in this case not in civ .",
    "the sumer instrument had limited access to coronal emission lines , and no velocity studies of fan loops were made for higher temperatures than neviii ( 0.7  mk ) .",
    "the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ; * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ hinode _  satellite @xcite is the first solar ultraviolet spectrometer to routinely allow the measurement of coronal emission line doppler shifts to precisions of 0.5  km  s@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "it also has access to lines from the upper transition region ( temperatures 0.21.0  mk ) and thus there is some temperature overlap with the soho / sumer instrument .",
    "eis therefore , for the first time , allows the change in velocity structure from the transition region to the corona to be investigated with a single instrument .",
    "studies of @xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that specific locations in an active region can show a change from redshifts to blueshifts from the transition region to the corona . @xcite",
    "presented velocity measurements in fan loops near a sunspot and found evidence of decreasing redshift with temperature : fevii at @xmath7  km  s@xmath0 , feviii at @xmath8  km  s@xmath0  and feix at @xmath9  km  s@xmath0  ( lines formed at 0.6 , 0.7 and 0.8  mk , respectively ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite have demonstrated that the velocity structure within the vicinity of active region fan loops changes with temperature .",
    "they presented velocity maps in different emission lines showing that the fan loops display redshifts ( downflows ) for temperatures up to 0.8  mk .",
    "there is an abrupt change to approximately zero velocity at a temperature of 1.0  mk , and then a change to strong blueshifts at higher temperatures of 1.02.0  mk .",
    "these blueshifts represent the active region outflow regions that have been described in earlier eis papers @xcite .",
    "the authors suggested that the cool fan loops are distinct structures from the active region outflows , with the latter probably representing open field plasma that escapes to the solar wind , while the former are closed loops .",
    "further support for a distinction between the outflow regions and the fan loops is provided by @xcite who compared time sequences of images and velocity maps from the eis lines sivii @xmath4275.37 ( @xmath10  mk ) and fexii @xmath4195.12 ( 1.6  mk ) .",
    "inspection of the images presented in @xcite shows that the fan loops have a filamentary structure in both velocity and intensity and thus there is the possibility that the bright ( in intensity ) filaments within the loop may not necessarily correspond to filaments with the strongest velocity shifts .",
    "the present work considers a specific example of a fan loop that is distinct in intensity and that is aligned along the line - of - sight to the observer ( thus making the measured line - of - sight velocities a good approximation to the actual loop velocities ) .",
    "the aim is to place the qualitative observations of @xcite onto a quantitative basis . a key part of the work is to make a general prescription for deriving absolute velocities with correct error bars with eis , which has not been previously done .",
    "detailed descriptions of the eis instrument are provided in @xcite and @xcite , and we summarize here only properties that are important to the current investigation .",
    "eis has a single mirror for focusing and a single grating for dispersing the solar spectrum .",
    "both the mirror and grating are partitioned into two halfs that have different multilayer coatings .",
    "the coatings are optimized to yield high sensitivity in two wavelength bands of 170212 and 246 - 292    that we refer to as the short wavelength ( sw ) and long wavelength ( lw ) bands , respectively .",
    "the two bands are imaged onto two distinct ccds .",
    "the image of the sun returned by the mirror is sent through one of a choice of four slits .",
    "for the present investigation the data are obtained with the narrowest slit , for which the width projected onto the sun is 1 .",
    "the exposure that is imaged on the ccd contains spectral information along the ccd x - axis , and solar - y spatial information along the ccd y - axis .",
    "a single pixel corresponds to 22.3  m  in the spectral dimension and 1  in the spatial dimension . to build up a 2d image of the sun",
    ", the mirror is tilted through consecutive steps of projected size 1  after each exposure . the maximum size of a single eis raster is @xmath11  arcsec@xmath12 .",
    "there are three instrumental issues that have a direct effect on velocity measurements with eis .",
    "the most significant is an oscillation of the grating due to varying thermal conditions during the 98  min orbit of the hinode satellite .",
    "it results in the positions of the spectra on the detectors drifting in a quasi - sinusoidal manner by @xmath13  pixel ( @xmath1439  km  s@xmath0 , depending on wavelength ) .",
    "this orbital thermal drift is typically corrected using the spectra themselves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but an independent method that makes use of instrument temperature readings has recently been developed @xcite .",
    "the remaining issues that affect velocity measurements are related to the eis slits .",
    "neither of the two narrow slits are exactly aligned with the ccd axes , which means that the emission line centroids change with y - position on the detector ( an effect usually referred to as `` slit tilt '' ) .",
    "in addition the slits also show a small but measurable curvature . @xcite",
    "have accurately measured the tilt and curvature from measurements of strong emission lines .",
    "two further instrumental issues affect the images obtained in different emission lines .",
    "the dispersion axis of the grating is slightly tilted relative to the ccd x - axis which results in the images of lines at different wavelengths being slightly offset from each other @xcite .",
    "secondly , the two ccds are not exactly aligned with each other which , when coupled with the grating tilt , means that a solar feature that appears on a particular row on the lw detector will appear between 15 and 20 pixels higher on the sw detector .",
    "since the same sets of rows are read out from each detector it means that the field - of - view for the lw emission lines is different to the field - of - view for the sw emission lines by 1520  for each exposure , thus a feature seen at the top or bottom of the image from one channel may not be seen in the other channel .",
    "the eis data are calibrated with the _ solarsoft _ idl routine eis_prep that is described in eis software note no",
    ".  1 @xcite , and standard processing options were used in the present work . a post - processing step was also performed whereby the intensity values in ccd pixels flagged as `` warm '' or `` hot '' by eis_prep were interpolated from neighboring pixels using a method described in eis software note no .",
    "13 @xcite .",
    "this method yields improved gaussian fits to line profiles compared to simply treating the warm and hot pixels as missing data .",
    "a list of the eis emission lines studied in the present work are given in table  [ tbl.ions ] , together with information about the temperature at which the emission lines are formed .",
    "the temperature of maximum ionization , @xmath15 , sometimes does not accurately describe the temperature at which an emission line is principally emitted .",
    "if we isolate the temperature dependent terms that contribute to a line s observed intensity , @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ionization fraction for the emitting ion , @xmath19 is the line emissivity computed by solving the level balance equations for the ion , and @xmath20 is the differential emission measure ( dem ) curve . for spectral modeling ,",
    "a discretized temperature scale of fixed width in @xmath21 is often used for computing the intensity , and so @xmath22 for a set of temperatures @xmath23 typically tabulated at fixed intervals of @xmath21 .",
    "when considering a particular dem curve , the temperature that yields the largest contribution to @xmath16 is the one for which the curve @xmath24 has its maximum .",
    "we call this temperature the _ effective temperature _ , @xmath25 , and the values for the ions considered here assuming a quiet sun dem curve are shown in table  [ tbl.ions ] .",
    "the calculation was performed using version  6 of the chianti atomic database @xcite assuming a constant pressure atmosphere of @xmath26  k  @xmath2 , the ionization balance of @xcite , and the quiet sun dem that is distributed with the chianti database and which was computed from the quiet sun spectra of @xcite .",
    "the temperatures are given to the nearest 0.05 in @xmath21 .",
    "comparing the @xmath15 and @xmath25 values in table  [ tbl.ions ] the differences are mostly small , but for feviii the difference is very significant and arises from the broad ionization fraction of this curve and the steeply rising dem curve in the upper transition region .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail by @xcite . the key point for the present paper",
    "is that feviii emission lines principally arise from the same plasma that gives rise to sivii and mgvii .",
    "when referring to temperatures of formation of the eis lines in the remainder of this paper we will use the @xmath25 values from table  [ tbl.ions ] .",

    "the aim of the present work is to make a definitive measurement of the absolute velocity of the plasma in an active region fan loop by making use of the wide temperature coverage of the eis instrument .",
    "fan loops are found in virtually all active regions but for the present work particular criteria were required : the footpoint regions must be approximately orientated towards the observer s line - of - sight ; the footpoints must be isolated from other active region structures ; and there must be an area of quiet sun within the raster field - of - view .",
    "the first criterion ensures that the line - of - sight velocities measured through emission line doppler shifts are a close approximation to the real motions within the loop structures .",
    "the second criterion is required to prevent any contamination of the observed loop by neighboring structures , and the third criterion ensures that a velocity measurement relative to the quiet sun can be made .    for this paper a single footpoint region was selected from active region ar 11032 which crossed the solar disk during 2009 november 1426 .",
    "the region had emerged on october 22 during the previous solar rotation when it produced several weak c - flares , but it was quiescent during the second disk passage . on november 21 23:44  ut an eis raster covering the west side of the region",
    "was obtained with the study hpw015_detailed_map that was centered at heliocentric coordinates ( + 379,+251 ) in arcseconds .",
    "the raster scan used 45  sec exposures with the 1  slit for 200 steps , giving an image of size 200  @xmath27 360  obtained over 2  hours 36  mins .",

    "[ fig.euvi ] shows the active region close to the time of the eis observation as seen in the 171 filter of the trace satellite .",
    "this filter predominantly shows plasma at around one million k and the fan loops are identified as structures that fan out with height , sometimes connecting through large loops to the opposite polarity side of the active region , or simply seen to extend out from the active region until they can no longer be distinguished against the background . in the latter case",
    "they may connect to another active region , to the quiet sun , or perhaps even extend out into the heliosphere .",
    "two loop footpoints are highlighted in the trace image of fig .",
    "[ fig.euvi ] that are bright and appear to have only a small spatial extent . by considering the 171 filters of the a and b stereo spacecraft ( left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.euvi ] , respectively ) which are at heliocentric angles of @xmath28 and @xmath29 compared to earth , it is apparent that the trace loops are quite extended and are aligned close to the line - of - sight of the trace instrument . by using the angular separations of the two stereo spacecraft and measuring the projected lengths of the loops from the images shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.euvi ] we estimate through elementary geometry that the angle of the loops to the trace ( and thus _ hinode _ ) line - of - sight is around 20@xmath30 .",
    "this means that the loops are excellent candidates for measuring line - of - sight velocities with eis since the measured velocities will be close to the actual velocities along the loops .",
    "images of the active region from eis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ar ] : the left panel shows an image formed from feviii @xmath4185.21 ( formed around 0.7  mk ) ; the middle panel shows an image formed from fex @xmath4184.54 ( around 1.1  mk ) ; and the right panel shows an image formed from fexii @xmath4195.12 ( around 1.5  mk ) .",
    "the fex @xmath4184.54 image is most similar to the trace 171 image of figure  [ fig.euvi ] .",
    "the feviii @xmath4185.21 image shows a number of compact , spiky structures that can be identified as the footpoints of the fex loops .",
    "the fexii image shows the same general loop structures as fex , but the loops are more extended and there appears to be many more of them .",
    "to determine absolute line - of - sight velocities it is necessary to be able to compare the measured spectrum with a calibration spectrum where the lines of interest are either at rest or at a known velocity .",
    "ideally this would be done using an on board calibration lamp that yields accurately known wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately it is not practical to fly calibration lamps for the eis wavelength ranges , and no flight - quality lamp exists .",
    "there are several reasons for this , including the lack of useful materials to use as the lamp window ( typical materials such as quartz , lif and mgf are all opaque below 1000   ) ; large power requirements ; and the weakness of the euv spectrum from gases that might be used in the lamp ( e.g. , ne , ar ) .",
    "an alternative method is to use photospheric or low chromosphere lines measured in the same spectrum as the lines of interest .",
    "these cool lines typically show only very small velocity shifts and thus can be treated as at rest , allowing the absolute wavelength scale to be determined .",
    "an example of the use of this method was provided by @xcite who used emission lines from neutral and singly - ionized species such as oi , ci and feii to yield an absolute wavelength scale for the soho / sumer instrument .",
    "justification for this method comes from the work of @xcite , who used data from a rocket - based spectrometer with an on board calibration lamp to show that an emission line of siii has a zero net velocity shift in the quiet sun .",
    "additional support for the small velocities of photospheric lines comes from the analysis of @xcite who used absorption lines of sii , fei and gei measured from a balloon experiment to determine an absolute photospheric redshift of 1  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "although significant for the photosphere , this velocity is small compared to typical transition region and coronal velocities and means that the photospheric lines can be usefully considered to be at rest .",
    "for the eis wavelength ranges this method can not be used as the coolest emission line in the spectrum is heii @xmath4256.32 ( actually a self - blend of two lines ) that is formed around 80,000  k and so can not be considered a photospheric or low chromosphere line .",
    "the method of using photospheric or low chromosphere lines to set the absolute wavelength scale can thus not be applied to the eis spectra .",
    "another method for determining an absolute wavelength scale is to assume that coronal lines have a zero net line - of - sight velocity above the solar limb , which is a plausible assumption given the long line - of - sight and the likelihood that the line - of - sight components of any bulk plasma motions would balance out .",
    "two eis exposures can then be made , one at the limb and one at the location of the active region on the disk , with the limb spectrum yielding the wavelength calibration .",
    "this method does not work however due to the orbital thermal drift effect discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect.eis ] , which means that the spectral position obtained at the limb will no longer be valid when the active region exposures are taken on the disk .    a further method for determining",
    "the absolute wavelength calibration is to observe quiet sun simultaneously with the active region .",
    "that is , each individual eis exposure will contain emission from both active region and quiet sun at locations along the slit .",
    "the average absolute velocity of the quiet sun as a function of temperature was accurately established by @xcite using sumer spectra .",
    "thus , for an eis emission line formed at a specific temperature , the quiet sun velocity from the velocity curve shown in fig .  6 of @xcite can be obtained and used to convert the measured eis quiet sun velocity to a rest wavelength .",
    "this is the method used in the present work .",
    "a potential problem for this method is the highly dynamic nature of the the quiet sun at transition region temperatures , which means that a specific patch of quiet sun may not show the velocity pattern found by @xcite .",
    "further , quiet sun in the vicinity of an active region may show significant differences from a quiet sun region far from centers of activity .",
    "these issues can not be investigated with the eis data , however we note that ( i ) the quiet sun regions selected from the eis rasters are averaged over 50  in the y - direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ar ] ) and so represent a spatial average over the quiet sun ; ( ii ) the error bars provided by @xcite are derived from the spatial variation of the velocity shifts over the quiet sun and are included in the present analysis ; and ( iii ) the emission line intensities found for feviii in the quiet sun region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ar ] are consistent with an average quiet sun value ( see sect .  [ sect.fe8 ] ) .",
    "we thus believe it is a reasonable approximation to apply the @xcite quiet sun velocity results to a quiet sun location close to an active region .",
    "an alternative means of deriving the absolute wavelength scale for eis data has been presented by @xcite . here an empirical model that relates the variation of the fexii @xmath4195.12 line centroid to various temperature measurements within the eis instrument over the entire eis mission has been created . by assuming that fexii has a zero net velocity shift for all eis exposures , the model is able to yield an absolute wavelength scale for any exposure obtained at any point in the mission . as the temperature data used by the model comes from the eis housekeeping data - stream , this wavelength calibration method is referred to as the `` hk method '' .",
    "@xcite give an accuracy for the hk method of 4.4  km  s@xmath0 . a comparison between the hk method and the quiet sun method used here",
    "is presented in appendix  [ app.kamio ] , where it is seen that there is a systematic offset in the two wavelength calibrations of 5.4  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the quiet sun method of wavelength calibration is preferred here as it can be directly related to previous , accurate measurements of solar velocities .    even after the absolute wavelength scale has been determined for the quiet part of the raster , the instrumental issues mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sect.eis ] mean that the absolute wavelength scale can not be directly applied to the spatial locations within the active region structures .",
    "firstly , the eis slits are not straight nor are they exactly aligned to the axes of the detectors .",
    "this means that the rest wavelength of a line will change with the y - location of the ccd , and so the rest wavelength determined from the quiet sun part of the slit image needs to be adjusted in order to apply it to the active region structure .",
    "the tilts have been measured quite precisely by @xcite and the parameters from this work are used here .    a second instrumental issue that affects velocity measurements appears to be due to a distorted point spread function for the eis instrument , and this is discussed in the following section .",
    "a striking feature of velocity maps obtained from eis is that regions of strongest redshift or blueshift are often spatially offset from regions with the highest intensity .",
    "this effect is found in the present work for the loop footpoints highlighted by an arrow in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ar ] and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.fe8vel ] .",
    "a sub - region of size 41 pixels @xmath27 41 pixels has been extracted from the full feviii image of fig .  [ fig.eis-ar ] and gaussian fits to the @xmath4185.21 line have been performed at each spatial pixel to yield line intensity and centroid measurements .",
    "absolute velocities have been derived using the method described in sect .",
    "[ sect.fe8 ] .",
    "the slice through the data at x - pixel 57 shows two distinct intensity peaks at y - pixels 164 and 172 , but the velocity peaks occur at y - pixels 161 and 169 , respectively .",
    "although this feature could be explained by plasma rotating around the axes of the loops , a survey of several loop footpoints performed for this work showed that , where significant redshifts could be identified from the feviii line , they were always to the south of the location where the intensity peaked , no matter where the active region was located on the sun .",
    "in addition , it is clear from inspection of high resolution trace images that loops that are apparently monolithic actually comprise multiple , narrow features thus a large scale twisting flow is difficult to interpret within this type of physical structure .    to state the observed effect simply , wherever there is a _ decreasing _ intensity gradient from north to south ,",
    "the centroid of the emission line will be artifically shifted to longer wavelengths ( redshift ) ; and wherever there is an _ increasing _ intensity gradient from north to south , the centroid of the emission line will be artifically shifted to shorter wavelengths ( blueshift ) .",
    "observations of polar coronal holes provide another illustration of the effect that is apparent due to limb brightening in coronal lines .",
    "@xcite presented velocity maps of the north polar hole obtained with eis where a distinctive ridge of redshifts is found along the limb in the fexii @xmath4195.12 and fexiii @xmath4202.04 emission lines .",
    "this arises because there is a decreasing intensity gradient from north to south at the limb .",
    "inspection of velocity maps from the south polar hole show a ridge of blueshifts as the intensity gradient is in the opposite direction .",
    "@xcite also reported that the bright points within the coronal hole systematically displayed blueshifts on one side and redshifts on the other .",
    "the authors interpreted this as siphon flows within the structures but it may actually be due to the strong intensity gradients when bright points are observed within a dark coronal hole .",
    "a similar effect was found from spectra from the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument on board soho and was explained in terms of an asymmetric point spread function ( psf ) by @xcite .",
    "consider a psf in the shape of a 2-dimensional gaussian function , but with an elliptical cross - section .",
    "the axes of the ellipse are tilted relative to the wavelength  solar - y axes of the detector such that the long axis of the ellipse is at an angle of 135@xmath30 to the wavelength axis . now if a bright spot of emission is imaged",
    ", the photon counts will appear on the detector as an ellipse . on the north side of the ellipse",
    ", there is an excess of counts to the short wavelength side of the spot , while on the south side of the ellipse there is an excess of counts on the long wavelength side of the spot .",
    "measuring the centroid of the spot as a function of solar - y will thus show a blueshift on the north side of the spot , and a redshift on the south side , consistent with the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.fe8vel ] .",
    "note that if the psf was rotated through 90@xmath30 then the opposite velocity pattern would appear in the observations .",
    "the psf will be expected to vary with position along the 1024length of the eis slit due to optical properties of the spectrometer , therefore the pattern of redshifts and blueshifts induced by the psf would be expected to change , but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "if the above interpretation of the data is correct , then the simplest way of deriving velocity shifts for features with steep intensity gradients is either to study only those pixels at the location of the intensity peaks in the solar - y direction , or to perform averaging in the y - direction over a region symmetrically distributed around the intensity peak .",
    "this is the procedure employed in the present work .",
    "in this section we describe the particular steps involved in deriving the absolute velocities and associated uncertainties for the 2009 november 21 data - set . as described in sect .",
    "[ sect.abs-vel ] , the method requires a determination of the rest wavelength scale from a patch of quiet sun that is observed simultaneously with the active region .",
    "ideally the strongest line in the spectrum should be used for this in order to give the best possible measurement in the quiet sun .",
    "however the strongest eis lines from the quiet sun are all formed at temperatures of 12  mk , the temperature range where the active region has its largest spatial extent .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ar ] which shows the raster image obtained in fexii @xmath4195.12 , the strongest line observed by eis ( formed at 1.5  mk ) .",
    "bright loop structures are clearly seen to extend all the way to the top of the raster and , although the bottom of the raster appears to be dark ( and thus potentially classed as quiet sun ) , the intensity is still significantly brighter than average quiet sun levels .",
    "this is indicated by the black contour which shows locations where the @xmath4195.12 intensity is a factor 2 brighter than the average quiet sun value measured by @xcite . at no point in the @xmath4195.12 image",
    "does the intensity fall to average quiet sun levels .    the feviii @xmath4185.21 image shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ar ] shows that the active region has a significantly smaller spatial extent at cooler temperatures .",
    "the contour , which in this case is set at 1.5 times the quiet sun @xmath4185.21 intensity measured by @xcite , shows that a significant fraction of the image at the bottom of the raster can be considered to be quiet sun .",

    "we therefore believe that there is no significant fex emitting plasma that is downflowing at speeds of 15  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity results for feviii and fex imply that there are multiple , independent components to the loop structure .",
    "an alternative method of studying this is to measure the loop filling factor with a density diagnostic .",

    "it has previously been used for density and filling factor measurements by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the filling factor at each x - pixel along the loop is determined as follows .",

    "can be converted to a plasma column depth , @xmath70 , with the expression @xmath71 where the constant 0.83 is the proton - to - electron ratio in the corona , @xmath72 is the abundance of the emitting element relative to hydrogen , @xmath73 contains a number of atomic parameters ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is a weakly - varying function of density , and @xmath74 is the electron number density .    from the measured mgvii line intensities along the loop , the value of @xmath74 at each x - pixel was determined using atomic data from the chianti atomic database . a background component to each intensity",
    "was estimated by considering a small region adjacent to the loop , and this was subtracted from the loop intensities .",

    "for the magnesium abundance we use the coronal value of @xcite , and the atomic parameter @xmath73 is computed from atomic data in version 6 of the chianti database @xcite , including the ionization fractions presented in that paper .",
    "the column depths are presented in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.mg7 ] , where the size of the y cross - section at each location is also shown .    to determine a filling factor it is necessary to make some assumption of the loop geometry .",
    "since the loop is considered to be at an angle of @xmath75 to the line of sight , then the y - slices at each x - pixel will be approximately elliptical with the minor diameter , @xmath76 , given by the width of the loop in the y direction . assuming a loop angle of @xmath75 then implies the major diameter ( in the line - of - sight ) is @xmath77 .",
    "the filling factor at x - pixel @xmath34 is then given by @xmath78 the values of @xmath79 are shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "[ fig.loopb-int ] ) . the method used to determine the column depth essentially requires the emission lines to be principally formed close to the temperature of maximum ionization ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the loop images suggest that the temperature is increasing with height along the loop , and so the mgvii ( and thus feviii ) lines will be brightest where the loop temperature is close to the ions @xmath15 values .",
    "the column depth and filling factor values should thus be most accurate in this region , and be less accurate at lower and higher heights where the displayed values are likely to be underestimates .    another factor that strongly affects the column depth and filling factor results is the element abundance .",
    "the @xcite value for mg is a factor four larger than the photospheric value , a standard enhancement that has been reported from remote sensing observations of the corona and in situ measurements of the solar wind @xcite .",
    "however , fan loop structures have been found to display different enhancements . @xcite found a factor 10 enhancement for a loop structure that was likely a fan loop , while @xcite found that the magnesium enhancement was found to increase with time in fan loop structures over several days rising to a factor 9 in one case .",
    "we thus note that a larger enhancement of mg than that of @xcite would reduce the column depth and filling factor values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.mg7 ] .",
    "the mgvii filling factor increases with height , with a value of 0.05 near the base ( x - pixels 5153 ) , and rising to around 0.3 around x - pixel 70 .",
    "the spatial region where feviii and fex have different velocities has a filling factor of 0.10.3 at the temperature that feviii is formed .",
    "this is consistent with the feviii emitting structure only occupying a fraction of the emitting volume , with the fex emitting structure occupying some remaining part of the volume .    loop filling factors from the eis mgvii @xmath4280.72/@xmath4278.39 ratio have previously been presented by @xcite and @xcite who both found filling factors close to 1 in the regions close to the loops footpoints . the present loop structure b is known to have filamentary structure based on the two strands identified from the trace 171 images ( sect .",

    "densities and column depths were derived from the measured fexii ratio using version 6 of the chianti database and the eis_density procedure @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of the @xmath4195.12 velocity map is the blueshifted region to solar - east of the loop footpoints , which also coincides with larger line widths .",

    "[ fig.eis-ims ] shows that the @xmath4195.12 intensity is lower in this region .",
    "these three features are a signature of so - called active region outflow regions @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath4195.12 profiles from the present region do not show the distinct emission component on the blue side of the emission line that was found by @xcite for an active region observed in 2007 december . instead the line profile is fit well with a single gaussian .",
    "the overlay of the loop b outline on the fig .",
    "[ fig.fe12-maps ] images shows that the feviii footpoint actually lies within the fexii outflow region .",
    "although the blueshifts are strongest at the base of the loop , and just to solar - east of the base , there are significant blueshifts along the body of the loop up to x - pixels of around 70 , and also the regions surrounding the loop .",
    "this suggests that the outflowing , low intensity plasma may be intermingled with the brighter loops .",
    "note that at x - pixels 8090 the velocity measurements are consistent with no net line - of - sight flow .",
    "we speculate that this region corresponds to loops and , in particular , the features labeled a  d in fig .  [ fig.eis-ims ] . along the body of loop",
    "b there is a trend of increasing line width and blueshift towards the footpoint , which may indicate an increasing contribution to the line of sight emission from the outflow region plasma .",
    "the density and column depth maps of fig .",
    "[ fig.fe12-maps ] reveal densities of around @xmath80=8.759.00 and column depths of 3060  arcsec for the x - pixel region 80100 .",
    "these column depths are consistent with the size of the long loop structures that are seen extending from the footpoint region in the stereo 195 images of fig .",
    "[ fig.st-195 ] . towards the base of loop structure b",
    "( x - pixels 5075 ) the densities are in the range @xmath80=8.959.15 and the column depths in the range 1223 .",
    "[ sect.loop ] suggested that this region ( corresponding to the fex `` brightness patch '' ) may represent loops that connect to a different spatial location than the loops in the x - pixel region 80100 .",
    "however , inspection of the stereo images of fig .",
    "[ fig.st-195 ] suggests that both sets of loops have similar heights and brightnesses which should be reflected in similar density and column depths .",
    "this is not the case and so there may be low - lying fexii emission that is co - spatial with feviii and fex , although rather more diffuse than these ions .    in summary ,",
    "the fexii emission around the loop footpoints is rather complex .",
    "there are large , extended loops with heights of up to 60  that extend away from the footpoints , probably at multiple angles to the line - of - sight .",
    "there is denser , low - lying plasma surrounding the cool footpoints , and there is outflowing plasma neighboring , and probably intermingling , with the loops that is around a factor 23 times less intense than the loop emission .",
    "the most significant result from this work is that a single loop structure observed with eis exhibits significantly different line - of - sight velocities in two emission lines that are relatively close in temperature .",
    "feviii @xmath4185.21 shows a redshift of @xmath81  km  s@xmath0 while fex @xmath4184.54 shows velocities close to 0  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the differences apply at the same spatial locations in the loop , and are sustained over a projected distance of 9  mm along the length of the loop .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the loop consists of at least two plasma components at different temperatures : one is cool and downflowing , the other is hot and at rest .",
    "the fact that the velocity difference is maintained over a large spatial distance means that the two components represent two distinct structures rather than , e.g. , the loop simply showing downflows near the bottom , cooler part of the loop and stationary plasma in the upper , hotter part of the loop .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of the trace instrument revealed that the eis loop probably consists of at least two narrow ` strands ' visible at 1  mk in the 171 filter ( fig .  [ fig.eis-ims ] ) .",
    "however , since both strands are emitting at 1  mk then they will both contribute to the eis fex @xmath4184.54 emission line and so do not represent the two velocity components .",
    "this result has important consequences if it is treated as a general property of fan loops .",
    "consider , for example , the work of @xcite who found neviii redshifts in fan loops identified from trace 171 images .",
    "the authors proceeded to make a loop model with a steady flow that could reproduce the trace 171 intensity profile along the loop .",
    "since neviii is formed at the same temperature as feviii then the redshift result is consistent with the present work ( although the magnitude of the velocity was significantly larger in the * ? ? ?",
    "* loop system ) .",
    "the trace 171 channel is dominated by fex with a smaller contribution from feix .",
    "if our eis result is extrapolated to the @xcite loop system , then the trace 171 emission has _ little or no physical relation _ to the neviii emission , and so the neviii velocity result can not be included in a model that seeks to interpret the intensity variation in the 171 loop image .",
    "one concept for how the loop may be physically structured is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cartoon ] .",
    "two distinct loop types ( or strands ) are shown .",
    "type 1 is stationary and emits fex along a large portion of its length , while type 2 is downflowing and emits feviii along a large portion of its length .",
    "the `` centroid '' of the fex emission in the type 1 strand is located somewhat higher than that of feviii in the type 2 strand , as suggested by the eis images ( fig .",
    "[ fig.eis-ims ] ) .",
    "since the type 1 strand must cool before descending into the photosphere , it must also emit feviii emission , but this emission will be much more compact than that coming from the type 2 strand .",
    "we note that the velocity of feviii @xmath4185.21 does fall at the lowest heights in the eis loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig.loopb-vel ] ) and the width increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig.loopb-wid ] ) which may indicate that the type 1 strand is contributing significant feviii emission .",
    "one question relates to the presence of any emission in type 2 strands from ions hotter than feviii",
    ". it would be surprising if the strand did not achieve coronal temperatures , yet the coronal emission lines observed by eis show that such emission either does not partake in the feviii flow , or that it is sufficiently weak that it is masked by the stationary coronal plasma of the type 1 strands .",
    "the work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggests that the velocity results found here may be a common feature of fan loops .",
    "if this is correct then , despite the division of the loop into two types of independent strand , these two strands always appear together in fan loops , and their relative distribution / strength always conspires to make fex appear stationary and feviii downflowing . if there was significant imbalance towards type 1 strands , then feviii would no longer display extended emission , instead being compressed into a small spatial region at the base of the fex strand . while an imbalance towards type 2 strands",
    "would yield a fan loop with either little fex emission , or with a fex line profile showing significant downflow velocity .",
    "a natural solution to the apparent connectedness of the two strand types is that the type 2 strand represents a later , cooling stage in the evolution of a type 1 strand .",
    "however , the number of stationary strands is well - balanced with the number of cooling , downflowing strands in order that a predominance of one over the other is not seen in the observations .",
    "these arguments are somewhat speculative and require a survey of many loops before they can be confirmed .",
    "certainly a check on the velocity difference between feviii and fex needs to be performed on many loops from different active regions . a thorough velocity analysis such as the one presented in this work is not necessary .",
    "simply measuring the wavelength separation of the nearby feviii @xmath4185.21 and fex @xmath4184.54 lines in the loops and comparing with the standard , off - limb rest separation will be sufficient .",
    "a study in the same loops of the intensity distributions of the feviii and fex lines with height would also be profitable by determining the heights of maximum emission .",
    "a time history of how the feviii  fex velocity difference changes ( or does not change ) for a loop is also an important study , as it may reveal if the balance between type 1 and type 2 strands changes with time .",
    "the concept of apparently monolithic loop structures consisting of multiple , unresolved strands has been explored previously by theorists , particularly with regard the nanoflare theory of coronal heating @xcite , where small heating events only heat individual strands , but combined can account for global loop properties such as temperature , density and emission measure . multi - stranded loop models have also been cited to explain observations that appear to show some loops have an isothermal temperature profile @xcite",
    ".    dynamic , 1d models of individual loops / strands that include plasma flows have been made by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered active region loops of 4080  mm in length , with peak temperatures of around 4  mk and coronal densities of up to @xmath82  @xmath2 ; while @xcite modeled quiet sun loops with lengths of 510  mm , peak temperatures up to 1.3  mk , and coronal densities up to @xmath83  @xmath2 .",
    "the parameters of the loop modeled by @xcite are closest to those of the loop studied here  a loop length of 67  mm , peak temperature of 3.6  mk and density of @xmath84  @xmath2  so we summarize briefly the velocity results from this work .",
    "the loop was allowed to reach a hydrostatic equilibrium with a coronal apex temperature and cool footpoints , and then allowed to cool with no heating applied .",
    "enthalpy and conduction fluxes balance the radiative losses of the plasma , and @xcite found that the enthalpy flux dominates in certain temperature regimes and evolution periods .",
    "as the loop progressively cools , increasing downflows are found near the peak temperature of the loop , varying from @xmath8510  km  s@xmath0  around 2  mk to @xmath8540  km  s@xmath0at 0.3  mk . at the temperatures at which feviii and fex are formed ( 0.71.1  mk ) the velocities are around 1520  km  s@xmath0 , and most of the length of the loop shows significant downflows .",
    "the feviii velocity measured in `` loop structure b '' of the present work is consistent with this model , but the flow is only found in the lower portion of the loop , and fex shows no significant velocity .",
    "the model can not be directly compared with the observation as the observed loop likely consists of many strands , and so a better comparison would be with a time - average of cooling strands randomly distributed in time . even then , there is likely a contribution to the emission line intensities and velocities from the heating phase of the strands which is not modeled by @xcite .",
    "the feviii  fex velocity result presented here would seem to be a valuable constraint on loop models of this sort , and modelers are encouraged to investigate how it can be reproduced .    finally , a comment on coronal velocity measurements .",
    "the present paper has laid out the difficulties of determining absolute velocities from the eis instrument .",
    "although eis is capable of measuring velocities as _ precise _ as 0.5  km  s@xmath0  @xcite , they are only _ accurate _ to , at best , 4  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "improved accuracy at euv wavelengths ( i.e. , below 912   ) is unlikely for the forseeable future of solar physics due to the lack of absolute wavelength standards .",
    "the only solution appears to be observing coronal lines above the lyman limit where either a calibration lamp can be used , or photospheric / low chromosphere lines with small velocities that serve as wavelength fiducials can be observed . since the allowed transitions of all coronal ions are found below 700    the emission lines must be observed in second , third or even fourth spectral order , but then blending can become a significant issue .",
    "there are some coronal forbidden lines that are found above the lyman limit but below where the photospheric continuum begins to become significant ( @xmath86   ) .",
    "the most notable such line is probably fexii @xmath41242 .",
    "a loop footpoint region aligned towards the observer s line - of - sight has been identified in ions formed from @xmath67 to 6.0 , showing a clear progression of hotter emission with greater heights . the continuation of the loop to higher temperatures of @xmath87 to 6.3 is less distinct and suggests two groups of loops that may return to the solar surface at different locations on the opposite side of the active region .",
    "line - of - sight velocities in one particular footpoint show redshifts of around 1520  km  s@xmath0  for the ions ovi , mgvi and feviii ( formed over @xmath885.8 ) . a clear and distinct drop to approximately zero velocity",
    "is found for fex ( @xmath89 ) , with the difference in velocity occurring at the same spatial locations and being maintained over a projected spatial region of at least 9000  km .",
    "fexi and fexii , formed at @xmath876.2 , show velocities consistent with fex although the loop structure is probably contaminated by distinct , outflowing plasma along the line - of - sight at low heights .    by comparing the line widths of feviii and fex",
    "it is shown that the different velocities of the two ions imply that the fex emission comes from a different structure ( or structures ) than feviii despite the fact that the loops visible in the ions images are co - spatial .",
    "the solution suggested here is that there are two distinct types of strand within the loop : one is hot and stationary , the other is cooler and downflowing .",
    "the second strand may simply represent a later stage of evolution of the first strand , but in this case there must be many strands that average out to give the observed loop emission .",
    "a density diagnostic of mgvii was used to demonstrate that the density falls monotonically with height from @xmath80=9.5 at the base to @xmath80=8.6 at a projected height of 15,000  km . assuming a circular cross - section for the loop structure , the filling factor is estimated to increase from around 0.05 at the loop base to close to 0.3 at 15,000  km . over the region where there is a difference in line - of - sight velocity for feviii and fex the filling factor is around 0.2 .",
    "as mgvii is formed at a similar temperature to feviii , this filling factor result supports the conclusion that the feviii emission comes from only a fraction of the loop volume , with the fex emitting strands contributing to some part of the remaining volume",
    ".    inspection of line parameter maps from fexii shows that the loop structure considered here lies very close to , or even within , an active region outflow region .",
    "these regions appear to be common to many active regions , and their close proximity to fan loops has previously been noted by @xcite .",
