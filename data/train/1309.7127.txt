    "early co observations of this region showed the w40 h  ii region to be located at the edge of the molecular cloud @xcite , resulting in the well - known blister morphology .",

    "the central region of the w40 molecular cloud and h  ii region is known to host an embedded cluster of young stars , with a significant population of early - type sources @xcite , with the earliest spectral type of about o9.5 @xcite .",
    "this cluster of early - type sources also partially reveals itself as a cluster of compact radio sources , coexisting with other compact radio sources which are classified as candidate ultra - compact h  ii regions and radio variable sources @xcite .",
    "together , these observations show that the w40 molecular cloud / h  ii region is one of the few nearby regions with active star formation away from the galactic plane , hosting an embedded cluster including high - mass stars , and thus representing a template laboratory to investigate the process of star formation .",

    "the fov of each array is @xmath2 13.7 .",
    "_ jhk _ band data were obtained in the service mode during the period 2009 december 15 - 17 .",
    "observations at four positions are required to observe a contiguous ( @xmath2 0.75 deg@xmath10 ) square field - called a wfcam tile .",
    "observation at each of these positions was taken using a nine point jitter pattern , and a 2@xmath32 microstepping pattern , with an exposure time of 5s each .",
    "the seeing was in the range 1.3 - 1.8 .",
    "we use the starlink software to do the initial processing , followed by mosaic making using the routine makemos in a manner similar to @xcite ( see this paper for details of wfcam processing ) .",
    "the sextractor software @xcite was used to detect all the stellar sources in the region .",
    "source detection and deblending is highly effective with this software .",
    "a detection threshold of 3 , and a deblend contrast factor of 32 was used for our purposes .",
    "subsequent to first pass of detection , the detection catalogue was filtered using the full - width - at - half - maxima ( fwhm ) , stellarness parameter , and ellipticity to remove spurious detections . finally , some leftover spurious detections were removed manually to create a reliable detection catalogue .",
    "aperture photometry for the detected sources was performed using the phot routine in the iraf apphot package .",
    "the aperture radius was set to 3 pixels (= 1.2 ) , and the sky annulus was located 9pixels away - with a width of 7pixels .",
    "sources without any centering error ( cier ) , sky fitting error ( sier ) and photometric error ( pier ) were retained for further work .",

    ". absolute photometric calibration of the _",
    "j , h , _ and _ k _ photometry was done using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) stars in the fov as explained below .",
    "we obtained 2mass data with the constraints of `` phqual = aaa '' and `` ccflag = 000 '' for all the stars in the fov .",
    "this ensures detections which have the highest photometric quality without neighbouring source confusion in all the three bands .",
    "we first constructed a _",
    "j - h / h - k _ colour - colour ( cc ) diagram using this data to identify only the main sequence ( ms ) stars in the region .",
    "the ms stars obtained using the cc diagram were then used to carry out the photometric calibration of the wfcam data .",
    "the 2mass data was converted to wfcam system using the transformation equations given by @xcite .",
    "wfcam data saturates for magnitudes brighter than 11.5mag in all the three bands , and these saturated points were replaced by 2mass magnitudes .",
    "completeness limit tests were carried out for all the three bands by choosing subimages of size 5@xmath3 5  located in the cloud region and field region .",
    "the 90% completeness limits for the _ j , h _ , and _ k _ band data are 19 , 18 , and 17 mag - respectively - for the field region ; and 18 , 17 , and 16 mag - respectively - for the cloud region ; giving the mean as 18.5 , 17.5 , and 16.5 mag , respectively .",
    "these early observations of wfcam have small differences in background matching between multiple chips and tiles , primarily resulting from the presence of large scale nebula contaminating the jittered frames .",
    "therefore , the _",
    "j , h _ , and _",
    "k _ catalogs were clipped at 18 , 17 and 16 mag limits for nir cc , nir colour - magnitude ( cm ) , and extinction map analyses to obtain conservative and robust classifications of both young stellar objects ( ysos ) and extinction measurements .",
    "since all nir magnitudes had low errors associated with them , they were not filtered by any error criteria .",
    "the magnitudes of bright sources which were saturated in the wfcam image , but had good quality ( phqual = aaa ) detections in 2mass , were taken from the 2mass catalogue after converting them to the wfcam system using @xcite .",

    "final image mosaics were created with the mopex data reduction software , by using the corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) ( s18.5 processed version ) , imask ( bimsk ) , and uncertainty ( cbunc ) files .",
    "mosaic images in all the four irac bands were created with a final pixel scale of 0.6 .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out for the four irac bands .",
    "we first used sextractor for source detection as described above ( see section [ section_nirphotometry ] ) and filtered to build a complete detection catalogue .",
    "the detection catalogue was used as input to the phot task in iraf to obtain the aperture photometry of irac images . the aperture size ,",
    "radius of the inner annulus , and radius of the outer annulus were taken as 2.4@xmath11 , 2.4@xmath11 , and 7.2@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the zero point magnitudes ( with aperture corrections applied ) were taken as 18.593 , 18.090 , 17.484 , and 16.700 for the four irac bands , respectively ; calculated using the irac instrument handbook ( version 2.0.2 , march 2012 ) .",
    "average completeness limits were determined using the peak of the luminosity function for the four bands . as is elucidated in the final delivery document for irac and mips data ( see its section 3.4.2 ) , for c2d legacy project @xcite , the peak of the observed luminosity function can be assumed to estimate the 90% completeness limit .",
    "we constructed the luminosity functions with 0.5 mag bin size for each band , and the peak ( and thus the approximate 90% completeness limit ) was found to be at @xmath2 14 , 14 , 11.5 , and 11.5 for ch1 , ch2 , ch3 , and ch4 , respectively .",
    "the south - east region of the wide - field image where the extinction is low was the only region where both wfcam and _ spitzer _ had a high density of sources causing source crowding problems .",
    "however , as mentioned in above sections , double - care was exercised in filtering first at the level of sextractor and then at photometry allowing us to be quite certain that the detected sources were all real and uncontaminated .",

    "the ysos are not in particular found to be correlated with the lobes of the bipolar nebula , suggesting that the bipolar nebula is relatively young , and not enough material has accumulated along the edge of the lobes to lead to star formation .",

    "we would like to note here that none of the class 0/i sources or starless cores from @xcite had any yso counterpart from our analysis within 1 matching radius , probably because these @xcite sources are younger ( and/or are oriented edge - on ) as opposed to the ysos identified in section [ section_identification ] which are class i or class ii / iii sources .",
    "it is possible that smoothing by @xcite to 13 beam - while we are only matching upto 1 here - might be the cause of mismatch .",

    "there are filaments to the west of this bipolar nebula which are a part of serpens south cluster ( not shown here ) .",

    "we display the continuum - subtracted h@xmath1 narrow - band image using inverted grey scale . the brightest emission from the _ herschel _ pacs 160 @xmath0 m image is overlayed using dashed contours .",
    "several important features are marked on this figure which are explained below .",
    "comparing h@xmath1 emission with 160 @xmath0 m contours indicates that most of the observed h@xmath1 emission traces the boundaries of filaments and dense gas traced by the 160 @xmath0 m contours .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission also reveals a faint bipolar shaped cavity centered on the w40 embedded cluster .",
    "the northern lobe of this cavity is clearly brighter than the southern lobe , however , the 160 @xmath0 m emission is also stronger in this northern region .",
    "brcs can be seen along the southern boundary of this bipolar shaped cavity in irac images ( see figure [ fig_centralarea ] ) .",
    "the morphology of the observed h@xmath1 emission features are indicative of fluorescent excited emission in most of the observed field .",
    "we note that the arc - shaped bipolar cavity in the northern region , partially surrounding the irs5 source , is also the region where several starless cores were mapped by @xcite ( see section [ section_spatialdistribution ] ) .",
    "it may therefore represent a dense shell swept by the radiation from the central embedded cluster . while the lack of collimated bipolar features indicate absence of shocked emission in general , confirmation of the fluorescent or shocked nature for the diffuse h@xmath1 emission is not possible without obtaining spectroscopic observations .",
    "figure [ fig_irac1withradio ] shows the _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath0 m image of the central portion of the w40 region .",
    "overlaid are the 610 mhz and 1280 mhz radio contours from gmrt .",
    "the early - type stars in the region - irs 1a south , 2b , 3a , and 5 have been marked with white squares and labelled .",
    "the @xmath54co(j=1 - 0 ) peaks from @xcite have been marked with plus symbols .",
    "it can clearly be seen that one of the @xmath54co(j=1 - 0 ) peaks lies at the western edge of the h  ii region .",
    "the @xmath55co(j=2 - 1 ) and @xmath55co(j=3 - 2 ) maps from @xcite also reveal the presence of molecular cloud to the west of ionizing region .",
    "this molecular cloud to the west of the h  ii region has also been observed in various molecular lines and in continuum at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the region thus appears to be density bounded to the west as is evidently borne out by the co isotopologues peaks .",
    "but , there is no such constraint towards the east , leading to the proliferation of ionizing photons towards this direction .",
    "this is indicative of blister morphology , also referred to as champagne flow @xcite , in the region .",
    "the radio contours depicted on the image also support this blister morphology for the region , with the head of the ionized flow towards the west ( density - bounded ) , and an extended emission towards the east .",
    "the peak of 1280 mhz h  ii emission is about 1.24@xmath13 to the south - west of the peak at 408 mhz from @xcite , but this could be due to their lower beamsize ( @xmath2 3@xmath13 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig_irac1withradio ] , there are no _ spitzer _",
    "class i ysos near this peak , only class 0/i sources or starless cores from @xcite are seen . also ,",
    "one of the class 0/i sources from @xcite coincides with the 1280 mhz radio peak .",
    "this is a probable indication of some high - mass star formation going on in this region , which is also supported by the outflow seen by @xcite .",
    "the timescale of the outflow from @xcite ( @xmath2 6 @xmath3 10@xmath56 yr ) is of the order of the age estimate from @xcite ( @xmath2 4 - 9 @xmath3 10@xmath56 yr ) of class 0/i sources .",
    "however , it is plausible that the outflow observed by @xcite might simply be the material swept - up and pushed into the bipolar shaped nebula .",
    "the h  ii emission does not extend all the way up to the edge of the bipolar lobes ( which marks the edge of the photo - dissociation region ) or trace them at gmrt sensitivity levels .",
    "the extent of the central h  ii region is almost same as the cluster radius at half - peak surface density ( see section [ section_spatialdistribution ] and figure [ fig_surfacedensity ] ) , which is expected .",
    "the central ionizing region is limited to @xmath2 2@xmath13 ( @xmath2 0.29 pc ) on either side of the midriff of the bipolar lobes .",
    "though isolated , non - thermal radio emission sources have been discovered by @xcite ( see figure [ fig_filamentarystructure ] ) , it seems unlikely that they are related to the w40 region due to their non - thermal nature .",
    "another feature of note is the sub - region around irs 5 which shows distinct radio emission with a roughly circularly symmetric ionisation region around this source .",
    "the presence of these various morphological structures support the schematic for this region by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 2 ) .",
    "the high - mass stars formed are probably located at the edge of the parental giant molecular cloud towards the observer , and as these sources have ionized the natal medium , the whole h  ii region has broken out of the parental cloud . the filaments seem to be emanating from the midriff of the w40 region .",
    "this suggests that the density was high along the equatorial axis , as compared to the polar directions , leading to a high density contrast .",
    "thus the lyman continuum radiation has escaped along the polar directions , flinging the ionised gas ( which forms the bipolar nebula ) partially towards the observer .",
    "this flung - off material seems to have encountered more resistance towards the north - as seems likely by the smaller diameter of the northern lobe , more extincted regions towards the north , and brighter 160 @xmath0 m emission from the northern lobe ( see figures [ fig_filamentarystructure ] ) .",
    "this probably indicates that the main body of the cloud lies to the north of the w40 midriff region .",
    "the initial orientation and location of the high - mass stars seem such that this presence of molecular cloud to the north has proven harder to disrupt , while the southern thin shell of molecular material ( between the high - mass stars and the ism ) has been blown away relatively easily .",
    "we note that the southern lobe could be appearing larger than the northern lobe due to the projection effect from the viewing angle , i.e. the region might not be being viewed exactly face - on , but from a non - zero inclination angle .",
    "as has also been evidenced in @xcite for various other regions , these northern and southern lobes could be more like rings than spheres , opening up the possibility that the molecular cloud could be oblate or sheet - like .",
    "the morphology of the filamentary structure shows its complete extent till the filaments join the central region .",
    "since the filaments can be seen right till they join the midriff , they are most likely in front of the progenitor molecular cloud .",
    "radio continuum observation data was used to derive the characteristic physical parameters like emission measure , electron density , dynamical age , and strmgren radius for the region . since",
    "this region contains multiple radio sources @xcite , we carried out a global analysis using the low resolution images ( @xmath2 45@xmath31 45@xmath11 ) to get an estimate of the parameters .",
    "integrated flux density was calculated for both the frequencies within 4@xmath29 contours using the aips task `` tvstat '' ; giving us a value of 4.07 jy and 7.55 jy at 610 mhz and 1280 mhz , respectively .",

    "as is evident from figure [ fig_em - fit - all ] , 610 mhz and 1280 mhz emission lie in the optically thick and thin regimes , respectively . therefore , using the flux density of 7.55 jy estimated at 1280 mhz , the lyman continuum luminosity was calculated to be @xmath2 1.67 @xmath3 10@xmath71 photons s@xmath21 . @xcite",
    "have estimated that the radio emission is dominated by an o9.5 type star ( irs 1a south , see figure [ fig_irac1withradio ] ) with a luminosity of 6.3 @xmath3 10@xmath71 photons s@xmath21 .",
    "they place an upper limit on the lyman continuum luminosity to be 1.6 @xmath3 10@xmath72 photons s@xmath21 .",
    "@xcite , using ir and low resolution ( @xmath2 11@xmath13 ) radio observation of @xcite inferred a luminosity of @xmath2 1.5 @xmath3 10@xmath72 photons s@xmath21 .",
    "our lyman continuum luminosity estimate differs by a factor of the order of unity from the calculated flux of an o9.5 type star in @xcite and the tabulated value from @xcite .",
    "however , it is about 10% of the value from @xcite and of the upper limit in @xcite .",
    "this could be because of absorption of photons by the dust in the region , implying the presence of dense gas in the central region .",
    "as has also been noticed by @xcite , presence of dust absorption can lead to underestimation of radio luminosity . @xcite",
    "have estimated that dust absorption can range from 60% upto 96% of the ionizing photons .",
    "similar underestimation of ionizing flux by radio data has been observed for other regions in @xcite .",
    "the luminosity calculated here , therefore , is most likely just the lower limit .    in the first stage during the ionization of a region by massive star(s ) , the ionization front propagates outwards leading to an expansion of the h  ii region , till an equilibrium is reached between the number of ionizations and recombinations .",
    "the radius of the h  ii region at this point , assuming that the ambient medium has spatially uniform density , is given by @xcite :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is called the strmgren radius ( in cm ) .",

    "the value of @xmath76 , for a @xmath60 of 8500 k , was taken to be 2.94@xmath310@xmath77 @xmath78 s@xmath21 @xcite . in the second stage of expansion , after the strmgren radius has been reached , the shock front overtakes the ionization front due to the vast pressure difference between material inside and outside of the ionization front . in this stage ,",
    "the radius of the h  ii region is given by @xcite :    @xmath79    where @xmath80 denotes the extent of the h  ii region at time @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the speed of sound , taken as 11@xmath310@xmath83 cm s@xmath21 @xcite . since we have no way of gauging the initial ambient density ( @xmath84 ) of the molecular cloud , we have plotted the parameters for ambient density ranging from 1000 to 15000 @xmath63 to get an estimate of the ranges .",
    "figure [ fig_radiusage ] shows strmgren radius ( @xmath74 ) and dynamical age ( @xmath81 ) plotted as a function of initial ambient density of the medium .",
    "strmgren radius varies from @xmath2 0.17 to 0.03 pc , while the dynamical age varies from @xmath2 0.19 to 0.78 myr .",
    "if we were to take the higher estimates of @xmath85 ( the values discussed above ) , then , for a fixed density , the @xmath86 will increase and the @xmath81 will decrease . it should be noted that there is more than one massive star in the region , and each massive star will have its own strmgren radius and age .",
    "the multiple 3.6 cm vla sources found in the region @xcite will also contribute to the total flux .",
    "also , the radio morphology is not spherical here .",
    "therefore the above calculations should be taken as a representative value for the strmgren radius and age estimate , and @xmath62 should be taken as the averaged out electron density for the ionized region .",
    "since radio emission around irs 5 source is distinct from the rest of the morphology ( see figure [ fig_irac1withradio ] ) , we can carry out a separate calculation to determine the physical parameters around this source .",
    "for this , we first determined the 610 mhz and 1280 mhz integrated flux density in this region in a circle of 50  radius centered at the peaks of respective frequencies .",
    "this yielded a flux density of 121 and 109 mjy for 610 mhz and 1280 mhz , respectively . @xcite",
    "have detected irs 5 source using vla observations at 3.6 cm .",

    "another vla source from ( * ? ? ? * source 2 in their table 2 ) lies close to the irs 5 source .",
    "however , it has a flux of 0.90 mjy ( at 3.6 cm ) , and is hence insignificant for our calculation here .",
    "following a similar set of steps as above ( section [ section_overallregion ] ) , we determined the emission measure by fitting the free - free emission sed ( see figure [ fig_em - fit - irs5 ] ) to be @xmath2 2.01 @xmath37 0.04 @xmath3 10@xmath56 @xmath69 pc .",

    "we estimated the lyman continuum luminosity using the formulation of @xcite and 1280 mhz data point as in section [ section_overallregion ] ( in this case , since 610 mhz data point is in the optically thin regime too , it yields similar value ) , which results in a value of @xmath2 2.40 @xmath3 10@xmath87 photons s@xmath21 .",

    "the slightly lower value of the calculated lyman continuum luminosity , as compared to the value from @xcite is probably due to the absorption of photons by dust in the region .",
    "though the radio contours are seen within @xmath2 50  radius of the respective radio peaks ( figure [ fig_irac1withradio ] ) , it can be seen that the ionised region extends beyond that .",

    "most of class 0/i sources and starless cores from @xcite are approximately along the circumference of a circle of radius @xmath2 80  centered at respective radio peaks . therefore , taking the extent to be 160 and the ambient density ( @xmath75 ) to be a typical value of @xmath2 1000 @xmath63 @xcite , we use equation [ equation_stromgrenradius ] in conjunction with equation [ equation_dynamicalage ] to obtain the dynamical age of the h  ii region around the irs5 arc - shaped nebula to be @xmath2 0.11 myr .",
    "we note that though the ionised region appears more extended than what we have assumed in the above calculation , and the ambient density of the medium could be larger , a higher value of both these parameters will only increase the value of the dynamical age .",
    "therefore , the 0.11 myr should be considered a lower limit for the dynamical age of this sub - region .",
    "the nature of the ysos with their respectively distinct spatial distributions suggest a scenario in which ( spontaneous ) star formation has taken place at different epochs for ysos at different evolutionary stages .",
    "it is very likely that class ii / iii and the central early - type sources formed in an earlier epoch as the central region became jeans critical , followed by the formation of younger sources - class 0/i sources and starless cores from @xcite and class i ysos from our analysis - along filaments in a later epoch .",
    "the lifetimes of the dominant early type star in this region ( o9.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is of the order of @xmath2 10 myr @xcite , while the lifetimes of class ii / iii sources is also of the order of a few myr .",
    "the fact that the two lifetimes are comparable and that this region is not very old , makes it likely that the majority of the class ii / iii and central high - mass sources formed at the same epoch .",
    "@xcite , based on the velocity of molecular hydrogen , have opined that star formation might have been initiated several myrs ago due to an external shock .",
    "it is probable that this could have played a role too and affected the earlier epoch of star formation - one which led to the formation of class ii / iii sources and central high - mass stars .",
    "this seems to have been followed by star formation leading to younger ysos .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the formation of high - mass stars in the center could have driven a compressional wave into the individual filaments , leading the high - density regions in the filaments to become jeans critical , thus subsequently initiating the formation of class i sources , protostars , and starless cores .",
    "the stellar distribution seen has also been observed by @xcite , who , using the rosette molecular cloud as a template , have done a density analysis to conclude that almost all ir clusters lie at the junction of filaments .",
    "simulations by @xcite also show that the star formation during the course of evolution of molecular clouds to be mostly confined to the filaments and their junctions .",
    "@xcite , assuming the distance to w40 to be 260 pc , have estimated the mass of the molecular cloud ( g28.74 + 3.52 ) associated with the w40 h  ii region to be about 1.1 @xmath3 10@xmath88 m@xmath5 using 2mass extinction map .",
    "the mass estimated using extinction map depends on the distance as a square of it .",
    "@xcite have recently ruled out distances below 340 pc for this region . also , mass estimation in high optical depth regions can often get underestimated using this method .",
    "so , the mass estimated by @xcite is most likely a lower limit and the actual mass could be slightly higher , probably between a few 10@xmath88 m@xmath8910@xmath90 m@xmath5 .",
    "the irs5 region ( see figure [ fig_centralarea ] ) also seems to be hosting fresh star formation at the edge of the cavity excavated by the high - mass source .",
    "the starless cores and class 0/i sources from @xcite are found to be distributed along the edge of the h  ii region of this arc - shaped nebula .",
    "the arc of ( seemingly ) collected molecular material , along the edge of this arc - shaped nebula , has also been observed in various molecular lines @xcite , as well as at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite and h@xmath1 narrow - band image ( see section [ section_h2narrowbandresults ] ) .",
    "the farthest yso from the irs5 source in figure [ fig_centralarea ] is located at a distance of @xmath2 1.8  ( @xmath2 0.26 pc ) .",
    "therefore , using the isothermal sound speed of 11kms@xmath21 for the ionised region ( see section [ section_overallregion ] ) , it can be seen that the high - mass star could have lead to the sweeping - up of material which subsequently might have provided impetus to the formation of protostars and starless cores in @xmath2 0.02 myr . from the radio analysis ( see section [ section_irs5_radiocalculations ] ) , the lower limit for the dynamical age of this sub - region was calculated to be @xmath2 0.11 myr .",
    "the ages of class0 and classi ysos are generally of the order of a few 0.01 myr and 0.1 myr , respectively , and as such , their formation ( and those of starless cores ) could have been influenced by the expanding h  ii region .",
    "we add a caveat that though the numbers are consistent with a scenario where the high - mass star could have influenced the star formation at the periphery , this might not be the correct scenario necessarily owing to possible complex and hitherto unexamined morphological structures in this sub - region .",
    "based on the above discussions , the following appears to be a plausible chronology of star formation in this region . as the filaments formed and joined , they led to the formation of dense core at their junction , referred to as midriff in this paper . this seems to have initiated the formation of the central high - mass star(s ) and other class ii / iii sources . at this point ,",
    "an external shock - as mentioned by @xcite - might have given a boost to the star formation going on .",
    "the high - mass source irs 1a south was formed at the junction , as well as the entire cluster which is centered upon this source . due to lower density along the polar direction as opposed to the equatorial direction , when the high - mass star(s ) formed , the lyman continuum radiation escaped along the polar directions leading to the formation of the bipolar nebula .",
    "fresh ( spontaneous ) star formation seems to be going on along the filamentary structures and their junction ( albeit at lower stellar density ) as evidenced by the younger sources in class 0/i stages and starless cores .",
    "a few of brcs and elephant - trunks exhibiting h@xmath45 emission to the south of the midriff might have undergone evolution under the influence of the ionizing region which has chiselled them out .",
    "the high - mass source irs5 , which is distinct from the rest of the radio emission region , seems to have led to the formation of a separate arc - shaped nebula , and swept - up material to its periphery .",
    "future observations and analysis of the whole region in various molecular lines , radial velocity measurements , analysis of cluster properties using minimum - spanning tree method , understanding the mass and luminosity functions of the region , observations of indivdual brcs , and spectral observations of other nir bright sources will help in putting the star formation scenario on a firm footing .",
    "in this paper , we carried out a multiwavelength study of the galactic star - forming w40 h  ii region .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .   using the mir data from _",
    "spitzer _ in conjunction with nir data from ukirt , 1202 ysos were identified in the region , out of which 40 are class i sources and 1162 are class ii / iii sources .",
    "analysis of the yso distribution and nearest - neighbour surface density yields the cluster radius as @xmath2 0.44 pc and peak surface density as 650 pc@xmath4 .",
    "mass calculation using extinction map yields a value of @xmath2 126 m@xmath5 within this radius .",
    "2 .   the filamentary structures were examined to reveal 3 parsec scale filaments emanating from the midriff .",
    "two of them ( filaments 1 and 3 in our labelling ) contain most of the youngest ysos aligned along their lengths .",
    "filament 2 was found to be relatively diffuse with hardly any of the youngest ysos .",
    "3 .   sed fitting using the radio continuum emission at 610 mhz and 1280 mhz for the total emission region yielded the value of electron density to be @xmath2 1265 @xmath37 218 @xmath63 and the total lyman continuum luminosity to be @xmath2 1.67 @xmath3 10@xmath71 photons s@xmath21 .",
    "the dynamical age , for the ambient density ranging from 1000 to 15000 @xmath63 , ranges from @xmath2 0.19 to 0.78 myr .",
    "the irs5 arc - shaped nebular region was found to be distinct from the rest of the emission region , and was thus examined in radio separately .",
    "the electron density was obtained to be 288 @xmath37 55 @xmath63 and a lower limit on the dynamical age to be @xmath2 0.11 myr . a comparison of radio continuum photon luminosity with the tabulated values from @xcite shows irs5 to be of b1v spectral type , reaffirming previous estimate from @xcite .",
    "extinction map gives a value of @xmath2 71 m@xmath5 as the mass for this arc - shaped nebula .",
    "5 .   the star formation seems to have taken place in two successive epochs , with the formation of relatively - older class ii / iii and the central high - mass sources - resulting in a cluster which is centered around the high - mass star irs 1a south - followed by that of the youngest sources ( class 0/i , and starless cores ) .",
    "a distinct case is of the irs5 nebular region , where material seems to have been swept - up to the edge of this arc - shaped nebula by the expanding h  ii region of the irs5 source .",
