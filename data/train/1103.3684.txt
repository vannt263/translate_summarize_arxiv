    "a piece of nonmagnetic , linear and isotropic dielectric material with frequency - dependent permittivity @xmath0 kept at some finite temperature  @xmath1 generates and emits an electromagnetic field , which manifests itself as heat radiation , resulting from thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations . besides the thermal far field , near - field phenomena associated with nonpropagating modes have recently attracted increasing attention  @xcite .",
    "possibly important effects have been revealed , such as the emergence of both temporal and spatial coherence in the near field of planar thermal sources due to surface waves  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the influence of these surface waves on radiative heat transfer and dispersion forces at the subwavelength scale has been investigated  @xcite . in such studies",
    ", one usually considers a simple half - space geometry , or two half - spaces separated by a narrow vacuum gap .",
    "the characteristic length scale for absorption of heat radiation by the material is the skin depth @xmath2 evaluated at the dominant thermal frequency @xmath3 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the velocity of light in vacuum ; @xmath6 is the relative permittivity , with @xmath7 denoting the permittivity of the vacuum .",
    "thermal radiation generated inside the material can reach its surface only if it originates from its outermost layer with thickness on the order of @xmath8 .",
    "hence , if the linear dimensions of a given dielectric are significantly larger than the skin depth , the emitted radiation preserves no information about the material s geometry . in that case , radiating and non - radiating components of the thermal electromagnetic field equal those emitted by a dielectric half - space  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a seminal example which shows that measurable effects occur when the above two length scales become comparable , so that the half - space model becomes inadequate .",
    "we consider an infinite , planar dielectric slab and study the dependence of both its thermal far and near field on its thickness  @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath9 is large compared to @xmath8 , the propagating radiation emitted by the slab is described by the planck ",
    "kirchhoff radiation law  @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath9 is reduced below @xmath8 , two competing trends arise : on the one hand , multiple reflections of radiation inside the slab lead to a fabry  perot - like enhancement of the field ; on the other , the radiating source volume is diminished .",
    "we work out the consequences of this competition and show that , in particular , the near - field energy density close to the surface of a metal film can remain finite even when the thickness of that film becomes arbitrarily small , as a result of the emergence of a low - frequency surface plasmon polariton .",
    "we proceed as follows : in section  [ s_2 ] we briefly collect the required elements of fluctuational macroscopic electrodynamics  @xcite , and outline in sec .",
    "[ s_3 ] the construction of the classical dyadic green s functions for the dielectric slab ; these turn out to be significantly more complicated than the more often considered ones for a half - space , or for a vacuum gap between two half - spaces  @xcite . although properties of propagating thermal radiation may also be obtained by more direct means  @xcite , and numerical codes for investigating thermal radiation of layered structures do exist  @xcite , the detailed analytical discussion of these green s functions is of its own intrinsic value .",
    "green s functions for layered media appear in a variety of contexts , such as van der waals forces in multilayer systems  @xcite , magnetic noise in conducting slabs  @xcite , light scattering and control of spontaneous emission in planar cavities  @xcite , or thermal spin flips in atoms chips  @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "unfortunately , the algebra involved in writing down such green s functions , though not difficult in principle , is vexatingly cumbersome .",
    "here we resort to the formalism outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the systematic use of vector wave functions  @xcite , which combines versatility with transparency , and which allows us to treat both far - field and near - field effects on equal footing . with the help of the green s functions we then derive in sec .",
    "[ s_4 ] general expressions for both the intensity of the slab s thermal radiation field and its energy density , deferring tedious mathematical details to the appendix  [ a_1 ] .",
    "section  [ s_5 ] contains an extensive discussion of these results .    for the sake of definiteness we concentrate on dielectric slabs effectuating a coupling between plasma - like electron motion and the photon field  @xcite , such as metals . within the drude approach ,",
    "their permittivity is given by @xmath10 \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : drude}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the plasma frequency , and @xmath12 the relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "since the dominant thermal frequency amounts to @xmath13  s@xmath14 for @xmath15  k , and since typical relaxation times for metals are on the order of @xmath16  s , one can satisfy the inequality @xmath17 in the infrared , thus arriving at the hagen ",
    "rubens approximation  @xcite @xmath18 for the relative permittivity .",
    "for metals with comparatively short relaxation time , such as bismuth ( @xmath19  s at @xmath20  k ) , this approximation is quite good indeed .",
    "however , a drude metallic state can also be achieved with conducting polymers ; for instance , hexafluorophosphate doped polypyrrole [ ppy(pf@xmath21 ) ] yields a plasma frequency in the far infrared at about @xmath22  s@xmath14 , combined with an anomalously long scattering time quantified as @xmath23  s in ref .",
    "@xcite . hence , while we use this approximation  ( [ eq : hr ] ) for deriving various analytical estimates , we rely on the full drude permittivity  ( [ eq : drude ] ) in our numerical calculations . besides bismuth ,",
    "for which @xmath24 at room temperature , we will also consider more typical metals , for which @xmath25 is two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "we consider in subsection  [ s_5b ] the radiative intensity emitted by thin metal films , and demonstrate that the opposing trends hinted at above result in an optimum film thickness which maximizes that intensity .",
    "we then study in subsection  [ s_5c ] the `` evanescent '' near - field energy density , and establish a somewhat counterintuitive result : while the contribution of the te modes to that density vanishes when the film thickness goes to zero , that of the tm modes does not , but remains finite and becomes universal , at least within the scope of the simple drude approach .",
    "finally , we briefly spell out some experimental ramifications in sec .",
    "as is customary , we consider the macroscopic electric and magnetic fields inside the dielectric material , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , obtained by averaging the microscopic fields over some appropriate volume  @xcite , so that their small - scale , `` atomic '' fluctuations are smoothed out .",
    "since these fields are described by real numbers , one has @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the complex conjugate of the preceding term .",
    "a corresponding identity holds for @xmath27 .",
    "hence , it suffices to restrict the temporal fourier transforms @xmath30 and @xmath31 to positive frequencies  @xmath32 .",
    "following rytov and co - workers  @xcite , we describe the connection between the electromagnetic field and its sources by augmenting the dynamical macroscopic maxwell equations by fluctuating current fields . for nonmagnetic materials , characterized by the permeability @xmath33 of the vacuum ,",
    "only an `` electric '' current is required , the frequency components @xmath34 of which are regarded as independent stochastic variables .",
    "the resulting equations @xmath35 then adopt the status of langevin - type stochastic equations , with @xmath34 playing the role of a stochastic force . as in the theory of brownian motion , the correlation functions of these `` forces '' then are of central importance . as a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    ", they acquire the forms  @xcite @xmath36 where angular brackets indicate an ensemble average , overbars denote complex conjugation , greek letters specify vector components , and @xmath37 is the mean thermal energy of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with frequency  @xmath32 , omitting the vacuum contribution . as usual , @xmath38 is the inverse temperature variable ; @xmath39 is the imaginary part of the material s permittivity @xmath40 .",
    "since the stochastic maxwell equations are linear , there exists a linear relationship between the fluctuating sources and the generated fields , which we write as @xmath41 the dyadic kernels @xmath42 and @xmath43 are referred to as the classical electric and magnetic green s function , respectively .",
    "once these kernels are known for the given geometry , the correlation functions  ( [ eq : jjcor ] ) allow one to evaluate bilinear expressions of the fields such as @xmath44 which enter into the definition of basic observables , such as the poynting vector of the thermal radiation emitted by the material , or its energy density . in the following section , we outline the construction of such green s functions for a dielectric layer of finite thickness .",
    "readers not interested in the mathematical details of this construction can proceed to sec .",
    "the electric dyadic green s function obeys the inhomogeneous vector wave equation  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the square of the wave number inside a material with relative permittivity @xmath6 . besides , the green s function also has to satisfy the proper boundary conditions for the respective geometry . for nonmagnetic materials ,",
    "as considered here , the magnetic green s function is then easily obtained from the electric one through the relation @xmath47 for constructing green s functions , one starts from solutions @xmath48 to the homogeneous vector wave equation @xmath49 assuming cylindrical symmetry in planes orthogonal to the @xmath50-axis , the appropriate solutions are provided by the vector wave functions  @xcite @xmath51\\cos\\end{matrix}\\bigr\\}}(n \\varphi ) \\mathbf{e}_\\rho -      \\frac{\\partial j_n(\\lambda \\rho)}{\\partial \\rho } { \\bigl\\{\\begin{matrix}\\cos\\\\[-1.3mm]\\sin\\end{matrix}\\bigr\\}}(n\\varphi )      \\mathbf{e}_\\varphi \\right ) { { \\rm e}}^{{{\\rm i}}h z }   \\label{eq : m } \\\\",

    "this will allow us to apply the results obtained here to bulk materials covered by thin coatings  @xcite .    if there were no boundary conditions to respect at the interfaces , but the layer @xmath77 were extended to fill the entire three - dimensional space , the dyadic electric green s function with boundary conditions at @xmath78 specifying `` outgoing '' waves could directly be adapted from the literature  @xcite : for @xmath79 , one then has @xmath80 whereas the signs of the arguments",
