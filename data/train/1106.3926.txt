    "the extended atomic hydrogen corona of mars was first detected by the ultraviolet spectrometer experiments on the _ mariner  6 _ and _ 7 _ spacecraft that measured resonantly scattered solar lyman-@xmath0  radiation @xcite to a planetocentric distance of 24,000  km .",
    "this was followed by a similar experiment on the orbiting _",
    "mariner 9 _ mission @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using radiative transfer theory , analyzed the early data to derive a hydrogen escape rate , which they found to be compatible with the water photodissociation rate at mars .",
    "@xcite recognized that the apparently constant h escape rate derived from _ mariner 6 , 7 _ , and _ 9 _ , if extended backward over geological time scales , would result in an oxygen abundance in the lower atmosphere several orders of magnitude larger than observed .",
    "@xcite suggested that dissociative recombination of o@xmath2 , the dominant ion in the atmosphere , would produce oxygen atoms with sufficient energy to escape .",
    "however , since the energetic oxygen atoms are mostly produced below the exobase , determination of the escaping fraction requires detailed modeling , represented by the recent work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "@xcite also reported observations of  1304 emission up to 700  km .",
    "these data , together with those from _ mariner  9 _ , were interpreted by @xcite in terms of a cool , optically thick oxygen exosphere . since then , the only measurement of exospheric oxygen on mars is from the spicam instrument on _ mars express _ @xcite , but those data extended only up to 400 km where radiative transfer effects in the  1304 multiplet are significant and the evidence for a hot component of o atoms was inconclusive .    until recently there have also been no additional measurements of the extended hydrogen atmosphere on mars .",
    "@xcite , again with spicam , have measured  lyman-@xmath0  emission at 1216   , but only up to 4,000 km .",
    "again , they find that a two temperature h exosphere is possible , although the result is inconclusive .",
    "@xcite also suggest a two - component h distribution from monochromatic lyman-@xmath0  images of mars showing the h corona out to 4 mars radii ( @xmath3 ) taken by the solar blind channel of the advanced camera for surveys on _ hst_. radiative transfer modeling is necessary to extract densities from both of these data sets . @xcite",
    "also noted a variation in the lyman-@xmath0  brightness over a period of two months which they ascribe to a seasonal variation in the  loss rate .",
    "we report here on observations of both the extended hydrogen and oxygen coronae of mars made with the alice far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph @xcite on _ rosetta _  during the spacecraft s gravity assist swing - by of mars on 25 february 2007 .",
    "offset exposures enabled us to detect and map the  lyman-@xmath0  and lyman-@xmath1  emissions to beyond 30,000 km from the planet s center .",
    "moreover , except near the planet s limb , the lyman-@xmath1  emission is optically thin , allowing us to use a spherical chamberlain model to determine the temperature and density of h at the exobase without the need for radiative transfer modeling . from limb pointings at spacecraft distances closer to the planet , oxygen emission above the exobase",
    "is detected , allowing us to constrain the density of hot oxygen without the need for radiative transfer modeling .",
    "these data can be used to derive atomic escape rates and address the question of stoichiometric loss of water vapor from mars .",
    "_ rosetta _  approached mars from the day side making its closest approach ( ca ) at 01:54 ut on 25 february 2007 at an altitude of 250  km . in order to satisfy the scientific goals of the various remote sensing instruments ( see , e.g. , *",
    "* ) , the common instrument boresight was programmed for a number of fixed pointings towards both the sunlit and dark hemispheres of mars and offset from mars , as well as raster scans across the sunlit limb . due to operational constraints ,",
    "observations were not possible during the immediate ca period .",
    "the pointings of interest in this paper ( denoted by the operational designation alxx ) were al03 pre - ca , centered on the sunlit disk , al10e , offset pointings centered 2.5  and 7.5  from mars along the equator , and al11b , scans across the illuminated crescent post - ca .",
    "observation start times and geometry parameters are given in table  [ obstable ] . at the time of closest approach ,",
    "mars was 1.445  au from the sun and the areocentric longitude , @xmath4 , was 189.9 .",
    "solar activity was very low for an extended time , including when earth faced the same solar longitude 9 days earlier , with @xmath572 at 1  au .",
    "alice is a lightweight , low - power , imaging spectrograph optimized for _ in situ _ cometary far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectroscopy .",
    "it is designed to obtain spatially - resolved spectra in the 750 - 2000    spectral band with a spectral resolution between 8 and and 12    for extended sources that fill its field - of - view .",
    "the slit is in the shape of a dog bone , 5.5  long , with a width of 0.05  in the central 2.0  while the ends are 0.10  wide .",
    "each spatial pixel along the slit is 0.30 .",
    "alice employs an off - axis telescope feeding a 0.15-m normal incidence rowland circle spectrograph with a concave holographic reflection grating .",
    "the imaging microchannel plate detector utilizes dual solar - blind opaque photocathodes ( kbr and csi ) and employs a two - dimensional delay - line readout .",
    "details of the instrument are given by @xcite .",
    "the alice slit geometry , illustrating the shape of the multi - segment slit , is shown in fig .",
    "[ offset ] for the first pre - ca offset pointing of 2.5 .",
    "the second offset moved the slit an additional 5.0  away from mars parallel to the martian equator . except near the limb , the only features seen in the offset spectra are  lyman-@xmath0  and lyman-@xmath1 , and these data are used to extract the spatial profiles of these emissions .    a similar diagram for the post - ca limb scans , beginning 25 february 2007 at ut 03:33:02 , is shown in fig .  [ limb ] .",
    "at this time each spatial pixel projected to 280  km in altitude but as _ rosetta _  receded from mars the projected size of each pixel increased .",
    "the scan slowly shifted the boresight @xmath6250  km towards mars over a 15-minute period .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ limb_time ] .",
    "because of the scanning motion , these spectra were acquired in `` pixel - list '' mode , that is the position of each photon count is recorded together with a time tag so that spectra could be reconstructed with the motion accounted for . because the _ rosetta_-alice instrument has only a single data buffer , the data gaps seen in fig .",
    "[ limb_time ] result from the time required to read out the buffer to the spacecraft .",
    "the typical time to fill the buffer was 30  s , so in practice we accumulated individual spectra corresponding to @xmath630  s integrations .",
    "even so , to detect  emission at high altitudes , we need to co - add multiple spectra , as described below .",
    "during the gravity assist swing - bys of both mars and the earth , the _ rosetta _  instruments were powered on and operated primarily to provide flight verification of instrument performance and to acquire calibration data such as standard ultraviolet star fluxes and detector flat - fields .",
    "there were also opportunities to exercise the full range of instrument parameters that could be adjusted by remote command in flight in order to optimize the signal - to - noise performance of the instrument .",
    "for the mars swing - by , the detector high voltage level was set at 3.8  kv .",
    "subsequent operations and analysis showed the optimum setting to be 3.9  kv and all observations beginning in the fall of 2007 were made at that voltage .",
    "nevertheless , by comparison of stellar standards at different voltages ( and at different times ) , we are able to transfer the current absolute flux calibration to the epoch of the mars swing - by and this is incorporated into the current version of the data pipeline ( version 3 ) with which all of the data have since been processed .",
    "the data used in this study are publicly available , both from nasa s planetary data system ( http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/ ) and esa s planetary science archive ( http://www.rssd.esa.int/?project=psa ) .",
    "to derive spatial profiles of the observed emissions requires an accurate flat - field calibration .",
    "this poses a rather acute problem for lyman-@xmath0  at 1216    because the instrument was designed for this wavelength to fall in the gap between the kbr and csi photocathode coatings .",
    "the intent was to utilize the low detection efficiency of the bare microchannel plate to compensate for the very high expected lyman-@xmath0photon flux from the comet .",
    "however , because of a slight misalignment in the coating edges , the lyman-@xmath0  sensitivity varies by a factor of two along the portion of the detector that is mapped onto the sky . in contrast , at lyman-@xmath1  the variation across the slit is @xmath61.4 . there is also a @xmath720% odd - even detector row effect that is accentuated at the lower detector high voltage of 3.8  kv .    fortuitously , following the mars encounter , _",
    "rosetta_-alice was pointed towards jupiter and recorded many hours of spectra in support of the _ new horizons _",
    "fly - by of jupiter in february 2007 .",
    "these observations were made with the same instrument parameters used for the mars observations . since , from the orbit of mars the jovian system only filled a single row of the detector , high s / n measurements of detector flat - fields at lyman-@xmath0  and lyman-@xmath1  were obtained , together with a measure of grating scattered lyman-@xmath0  as a function of detector row .",
    "an added bonus is that since jupiter was only 20  away on the sky from the coordinates of the offset pointing , these observations provided a measure of the interplanetary lyman-@xmath0  and lyman-@xmath1  background for the mars observations .",
    "we used a co - added accumulation of 630,000  s of data obtained between 1 march and 10 march 2007 to derive the flat - fields used in the analysis described below .",
    "we briefly discuss the dayglow spectrum of mars , obtained under al03 pre - ca .",
    "it consisted of four exposures , each of 1028 seconds .",
    "a composite of the five central rows of the sum of four exposures is shown in fig .",
    "[ day_spec ] .",
    "the viewing parameters are given in table  [ obstable ] . at the start of the sequence ,",
    "the angular diameter of mars was 1.62  so that the five central rows of the detector were uniformly filled with the illuminated martian disk .",
    "for comparison with previous work , we also show the mars full disk spectrum recorded by the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) on board the space shuttle in march 1995 ( a full solar cycle earlier ) @xcite , convolved to the spectral resolution of alice . at the time , mars was 1.666  au from the sun , @xmath4 was 70.5 , and @xmath8 was @xmath975 .",
    "the hut spectrum is multiplied by a factor of 0.80 to match the brightness observed by alice , and this is quite good agreement considering the alice calibration uncertainty and the fact that the hut spectrum measured the integrated disk brightness , not just a central stripe of the disk .",
    "the comparison also serves to validate the wavelength calibration and provides a reference spectrum with which to compare the exospheric spectra obtained in al10e and al11b . as noted by @xcite and @xcite , with the exception of the  lyman series and  1304 , mars dayglow emissions , principally co and ,",
    "are confined to altitudes below @xmath6200  km .",
    "the two offset exposures were taken immediately following the full disk spectra as _ rosetta _  approached mars .",
    "lyman-@xmath1  was detected along the full length of the alice slit for both offsets . because the slit is segmented , for each row along the slit the observed lyman-@xmath1  signal was fit to a gaussian profile superimposed on a grating - scattered background that was fit to a second - order polynomial .",
    "the flux was then obtained by integrating under the gaussian and then correcting for the detector flat - field that was derived from subsequent jupiter observations as described in section  [ cal ] .",
    "the result is shown as a histogram in fig .",
    "[ lb_offset ] .",
    "the errors shown are statistical in the count rate .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0  profile is similarly derived except that the detector background , due to dark counts , was negligible , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ la_offset ] .",
    "the shape of this profile is very similar to the slant intensity profiles derived from the _ mariner 6 _ and _ 7 _ fly - bys by @xcite , although lower in absolute brightness as the _ mariner _ fly - bys occurred at a time of high solar activity .",

    "[ la_offset ] have had the interplanetary background subtracted as did the plots of @xcite the model fits to the data are discussed below in section  [ hmodel ] .      from the data acquired in pixel list mode during",
    "the limb scans schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ limb_time ] , we can extract a spectrum spanning a given time interval .",
    "however , because the line - of - sight of the spectrogram was changing its position above the limb with time , it is necessary to balance the motion with the need for a sufficiently long integration time to obtain an adequate signal - to - noise ratio for weak emission features . at the same time , we need to avoid contamination of the spectrum by thermospheric emissions .",
    "this was done by co - adding the photon counts from the first four exposures for row 14 ; the first 12 exposures for row 15 ; and the last 14 exposures for rows 16 and 17 .",
    "this results in an altitude weighted average with a trapezoidal shape of @xmath9320  km centered at 420 , 665 , 910 , and 1240  km , respectively for rows 14 to 17 , respectively .",
    "examples of extracted spectra for rows 15 and 16 are shown in fig .",
    "[ limbspec ] .",
    "note that only  and  emissions are detected . a possible feature at 1657    in the row 15 spectrum that could be a signature of escaping carbon atoms @xcite , is most likely an instrumental artifact as no emission at this wavelength appears in the row 14 spectrum .",
    "the background is due to grating scattered lyman-@xmath0 , which is variable from row to row .",
    "also , the spectra have not been corrected for the odd - even row variation noted in section  [ cal ] which is estimated to be @xmath625% for lyman-@xmath1  and @xmath610% for  1304 , based on the disk observations discussed in section  [ dayglow ] .",
    "for the analysis of the lyman-@xmath1  profile we follow the same procedure as @xcite , using the exospheric model of @xcite but ignoring satellite orbits , as they can be excluded by the observed lyman-@xmath1  brightness near 30,000  km planetocentric distance . for solar minimum conditions",
    "we take the exobase to be at 200  km and the exobase temperature , @xmath10 , to be 200  k @xcite , leaving the hydrogen density at this level as a variable .",
    "we assume that lyman-@xmath1  is optically thin and calculate a fluorescence efficiency ( g - factor ) of @xmath11 photons  s@xmath12  atom@xmath12 at 1  au using a solar minimum line profile and flux from @xcite .",
    "the interplanetary lyman-@xmath1  background is fixed at 1.0  rayleigh based on the subsequent jupiter observations that were used to derive the detector flat - field at 1026  (see section  [ cal ] ) .",
    "all fluxes are referenced to row 15 which is the nominal alice boresight and which is used for almost all of the stellar calibration measurements .",
    "the result is shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ lb_offset ] . the derived h density at 200  km is @xmath13  @xmath14 and the escape flux is @xmath15  @xmath16  s@xmath12 .",
    "the model atmosphere is given in table  [ denstable ] .",
    "optical depth unity along the line - of - sight is at @xmath65,000  km projected planetocentric distance . from the radiative transfer model of @xcite ,",
    "applied to the _ mariner _",
    "lyman-@xmath0  data , we expect the single scattering intensity to be about a factor of two higher than the radiative transfer corrected intensity at this optical depth , and this is consistent with the data shown in fig .",
    "[ lb_offset ] .",
    "@xcite , for their solar maximum observations , assuming @xmath17  k at an exobase altitude of 250  km , found an h density and escape flux of @xmath18  @xmath14 and @xmath19  @xmath16  s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "[ lb_offset ] also shows a model for 260  k ( dashed line ) , which , normalized at 30,000  km , provides what superficially appears to be a better fit to the observed profile .",
    "while it is difficult to choose between the models for planetocentric distances greater than 10,000  km , the absence of a strong optical depth effect in the latter suggests that the lower temperature model , corresponding to a typical exospheric temperature at solar minimum , is probably correct . for 260  k , the h density and escape flux are @xmath20  @xmath14 and @xmath21  @xmath16  s@xmath12 , respectively .    the same models , applied to lyman-@xmath0  using a lyman-@xmath0/lyman-@xmath1  ratio of 250 derived from the ipm measurements ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ la_offset ] .",
    "the agreement is excellent and the deviation from the optically thin emission is consistent with an optical depth along the line - of - sight of 1 at 10,000  km planetocentric distance .",
    "there is no apparent need for a suprathermal h component as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an interesting measurement of exospheric lyman-@xmath0  emission from _ mars express _ has recently been reported by @xcite .",
    "they found that the neutral particle detector of the aspera-3 experiment was sensitive to lyman-@xmath0  photons and measured a signal , attributed to exospheric hydrogen , out to a tangent height of 7,250  km above the martian limb .",
    "considering their large measurement uncertainties that include calibration , statistics , pointing , and background subtraction , their measured emission profile is in general accord with the alice data shown in fig .",
    "[ la_offset ] .",
    "however , they interpret this profile in terms of an optically thin resonance scattering model and derive an apparent temperature @xmath22k .",
    "as noted above , we find that the lyman-@xmath0  emission is optically thick below 10,000  km planetocentric distance ( @xmath66,600  km above the limb ) , which leads to a flatter spatial distribution and consequently the appearance of a higher than actual exospheric temperature .",
    "for oxygen we use a two - component model , again taking for the cold component , @xmath10 , to be 200  k , and an oxygen density at 200 km of @xmath23  @xmath14 @xcite . the curve in fig .",
    "[ oalt ] represents an added hot component of 1200  k with an oxygen density at 200 km of @xmath24  @xmath14 ( see table  [ denstable ] ) .",
    "the density decrease with altitude is considerably faster than the predictions of recent exospheric models of @xcite and @xcite based on a hot atomic o source due to dissociative recombination of o@xmath2 , and which are necessary to support a stoichiometric escape of water vapor from the atmosphere of mars .",
    "however , it has been noted that such inferences from a single viewing geometry during a period of low solar activity can be misleading as this mechanism is quite sensitive to solar activity and is dependent on solar zenith angle at the observation point .",
    "nevertheless , the present observations raise concern about some of the assumptions and physical parameters used in the recent modeling of oxygen escape from mars .",
    "@xcite , in their comparison of exobase and monte carlo models , summarize the literature on modeling efforts from the past few decades and conclude that `` efforts to balance the escape rates in the stoichiometric proportion of water are premature . ''",
    "@xcite focus on a comparison of escape rates and therefore do not compute the oxygen density profiles from their models .",
    "such calculation is warranted by the present data which would allow for a determination of the line - of - sight column densities appropriate to the alice observations .",
    "similar questions arise in the analogous modeling of the hot oxygen environment around venus @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the need for accurate data on energy transfer collisions between hot oxygen atoms and the neutral atmosphere ( they are mainly interested in helium ) which is at the core of the escape models .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite point out that an additional constraint on the models might be provided by spicam measurements of the forbidden  @xmath252972 ( @xmath26s  @xmath27p ) line , which is produced by both photodissociation of  and by dissociative recombination of o@xmath2 .",
    "the _ rosetta _  swing - by of mars on 25 february 2007 , provided the first spectroscopic observations of exospheric hydrogen and oxygen on mars from outside mars atmosphere since the _ mariner 6 _ and _ 7 _ fly - bys in 1969 .",
    "the spatial distribution of  lyman-@xmath0  out to beyond 30,000 km from the planet s center is similar to that found from _ mariner 6 _ and _ 7_. a chamberlain model , with current solar minimum model values of exospheric temperature of 200  k and an exobase altitude of 200  km , provides a good fit to the observed lyman-@xmath1  profile , although the data do not exclude temperatures up to @xmath6260  k. a suprathermal component , suggested by several authors , is not needed to match the data .",
    "the hydrogen escape flux derived from the 200  k model , @xmath28  @xmath16  s@xmath12 , is comparable to that derived from the earlier measurements . the distribution of atomic oxygen , derived from 1304    emission observed to altitudes of 1000  km above the limb , is not consistent with recent models of oxygen escape based on the production of suprathermal oxygen atoms by dissociative recombination of o@xmath2 .",
    "we thank the esa rosetta science operations centre ( rsoc ) and mission operations center ( rmoc ) teams for their expert and dedicated help in planning and executing the alice observations of mars .",
    "we thank darrell strobel for helpful discussions .",
