    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is the most precisely investigated theory in physics @xcite .",
    "it describes the interaction of electric charges by exchange of photons , and serves as a basis for many other existing field theories .",
    "experimental studies have been carried out with extremely high precision of up to @xmath1 , always consistent with the qed predictions .",
    "for a few simple systems , the experimental accuracy is matched by nearly equally exact theoretical calculations , which shows the power of the underlying mathematical framework .",
    "discrepancies between theory and experiment are nowadays often caused by insufficient knowledge of the nuclear size and its structure .",
    "even fundamental constants are known to limit the predictive power of qed to a certain extent .",
    "this , however , allowed high - accuracy experiments to provide the most precise values for the fine - structure constant @xmath2 @xcite and the mass of the electron @xmath3 @xcite .    for such precision studies ,",
    "simple systems have to be investigated , consisting of just an atomic nucleus and a few electrons at most .",
    "few - electron systems with a heavy nucleus are particularly important because they allow one to access the regime of extreme electromagnetic fields ( @xmath4 v / cm ) within a range of distances of the order of the electron s compton wavelength .",
    "this is also the region where perturbative qed , although being very precise , breaks down @xcite .",
    "the energy contained in these fields is also very close to that required for the spontaneous creation of an electron - positron pair out of the vacuum ( schwinger - limit ) .",
    "highly charged ions ( hci ) , combining very strong static fields and a simple electronic structure , are ideal testing grounds for these high - field qed investigations .",
    "hci can readily be produced and stored in traps and rings .",
    "sensitive techniques , such as mass or laser spectroscopy in storage rings , ion traps , and electron beam ion traps , have been developed to further advance this field .",
    "however , experiments with heavy hci have not ( yet ) matched the accuracy of experiments performed with hydrogen or simple light systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , the free electron or positronium .",
    "hci are either produced at once by impact of an energetic ion beam on a ` stripper target ' , or stepwise by electron impact ionisation of trapped ions .",
    "presently , the only way to produce sufficient amounts of hci ( up to u@xmath0 ) is by using relativistic ion beams ( about 1 gev per nucleon ) in combination with a stripper target , as being done at gsi .",
    "schematic of the hitrap project : deceleration , trapping , and cooling of highly charged ions for many key atomic physics experiments.,width=377 ]",
    "in a penning trap , charged particles are confined in the axial or @xmath5-direction by an electric quadrupole field created by applying static potentials ( @xmath6 v ) to the trap electrodes , which typically consist of two endcaps and one ring electrode @xcite . in the radial or @xmath7-plane ,",
    "confinement is generally achieved by use of a superconducting magnet which provides a strong , stable , and homogeneous static magnetic field .",
    "the motions that the trapped particles undergo are all simple harmonic oscillations and are very well under control .",
    "the motion in the @xmath5-direction is an oscillation with the axial frequency @xmath8 , and is the simplest motion to cool and to detect . in the radial plane",
    "there are two circular motions : a fast motion with the modified cyclotron frequency @xmath9 , and a slow drift motion about the centre of the trap with the magnetron frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the radiofrequency or paul trap is another type of trap for charged particle confinement , which is very often used , but its description is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ".    trapped ( charged ) particles form a point - like source and generally have small amplitudes of oscillation . once trapped , the particles can easily be manipulated , ( @xmath11)-selected , accumulated , and even polarized ( _ e.g. _ , by optical pumping ) .",
    "a number of cooling techniques exist , which , besides removing the particles kinetic energy and thus reducing doppler effects , also improve particle manipulation , selection , and the resolution of the measurement .",
    "such cooling techniques are laser cooling , sympathetic cooling , evaporative cooling , resistive cooling , and electron cooling .",
    "cold ensembles of trapped particles can also be formed into dense crystalline ion structures which could , for example , lead to an enhanced luminosity for reaction studies . since confinement times of trapped particles",
    "can indeed be very long ( up to months ) , there is an extended observation and manipulation time .",
    "thus metastable states can simply be eliminated by waiting , and a backing - free sample for decay studies can be obtained .",
    "this also makes traps very suitable for effective studies of rare species .",
    "further applications are bunching , charge breeding , and post - acceleration .",
    "all the above mentioned methods lead to drastically increased efficiency , accuracy and sensitivity . in principle , the highest accuracy can be obtained when only a single ( cold , highly charged ) ion is used .",
    "trapped highly charged ions have been successfully used for high - accuracy mass measurements in seattle and stockholm , for producing and studying ionic crystals in livermore , and for the determination of the @xmath12-factor of the bound electron in hydrogen - like ions in a gsi - mainz cooperation ( see below ) .    in order to further increase the accuracy , the highly charged ion trap ( hitrap ) facility",
    "is presently being built at gsi , and will be operational in 2008 @xcite . briefly ,",
    "stable or radioactive hci at relativistic velocities ( 400 mev / u ) are decelerated ( and cooled ) in the experimental storage ring ( esr ) down to 4 mev per nucleon , and injected into the hitrap facility . here , they will be further decelerated by a linear decelerator and a radiofrequency quadrupole structure ( rfq ) , and injected into a cooler penning trap , where a temperature of 4 k is reached by electron and resistive cooling .",
    "the cold hci are then transferred at low energies ( 5 kev per charge ) through a beamline to different experimental setups .",
    "the planned unique experiments are being prepared by several international groups ( ganil , groningen , gsi , heidelberg , krakow , london , mainz , stockholm , and vienna ) within the eu - funded hitrap project .",
    "a schematic of hitrap is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , together with a list of some planned atomic physics experiments .",
    "below , two such experiments are described in some more detail .",
    "schematic of the penning trap that will be used to measure ground - state hyperfine splittings in highly charged ions .",
    "the ions come from the right , are trapped , cooled and compressed , and are excited by a laser beam from the left .",
    "the emitted fluorescence is detected through the optically transparent ring electrode.,width=377 ]      the ground - state hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) of heavy h - like ions increases with the nuclear as @xmath13 and enters the laser - accessible regime for heavy elements such as @xmath14pb@xmath15 or @xmath16bi@xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 hfs in these h - like systems has been studied at the esr storage ring at gsi by collinear laser spectroscopy @xcite , and at the superebit in livermore @xcite .",
    "there also exist two measurements of the @xmath19 ground state hfs in li - like bismuth ( @xmath16bi@xmath20 ) .",
    "a direct measurement @xcite was carried out at the esr , but unfortunately no resonance could be observed at the predicted value of @xmath21 nm @xcite .",
    "the reason is unknown .",
    "an indirect measurement @xcite was performed in the superebit and yielded a value of @xmath22 nm , but the error in the measurement was rather large ( @xmath23 nm ) . from a comparison of the hfs of a h- and a li - like system , the nuclear effects ( _ e.g. _ , bohr - weisskopf ) cancel out to a large extent , and the qed effects can be determined within a few percent accuracy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the nuclear magnetic moments @xmath24 are not very well known , hfs measurements in few - electron systems will also allow for a determination of @xmath24 and can thus help to improve the knowledge of nuclear properties .",
    "for these laser experiments at hitrap a cylindrical open - endcap penning trap @xcite will be mounted inside the cold ( 4 k ) bore of a superconducting magnet ( retrap @xcite ) with radial and axial access .",
    "retrap was previously used to trap xe@xmath25 ions , produced by an electron beam ion trap , and to study the formation of ion crystals by sympathetic cooling with laser - cooled be@xmath26 ions @xcite .",

    "the high intensity of secondary beams produced at the sfrs will make it possible to extract decelerated radioactive ion beams from the new experimental storage ring ( nesr ) and to decelerate them for trap experiments with sufficient intensity at hitrap .",
    "therefore , the physics programme of hitrap at flair can be extended to novel experiments with trapped radioactive ions and , of course , with trapped antiprotons .",
    "trapped radioactive ions in high charge states may reveal a completely new domain for fundamental interaction studies and for experiments at the borderline between atomic and nuclear physics .",

    "however , in some cases , like double - beta decay or tests of the unitarity of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , a much higher accuracy is required , which is possible by use of hci stored in a penning trap at hitrap @xcite and at mats @xcite .      the planned flair facility will be the most intense source of low - energy antiprotons world - wide @xcite .",

    "hence we anticipate that experiments with trapped antiprotons will be performed at the flair facility , which are currently impossible anywhere else due to intensity reasons .",
    "a possible highlight in the field of low - energy antimatter research would be the first direct experimental investigation of the gravitational interaction of antimatter which has never been attempted up to now .",
    "such investigations could be performed on ultra - cold antihydrogen atoms @xcite which are produced by recombining trapped antiprotons with positrons in a so - called nested penning trap .",
