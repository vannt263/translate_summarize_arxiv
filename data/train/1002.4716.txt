    "much attention has been raised recently to the study of atom - photon systems , such as ultracold atoms and trapped ions , in view of quantum information and computation processing protocols @xcite . achieving these protocols with hybrid systems",
    "requires the capability of manipulating atoms and photons with high precision as well as long coherence time for qubits . as an example of such demands , an ability to prepare highly entangled states",
    "is needed in the beginning of protocols .",
    "it is then necessary to verify the quality of these entangled states and this can be accomplished by performing a quantum state tomography @xcite .",
    "however , it is rather difficult to perform the full tomography , in general , and it becomes impractical as the size of hilbert space increases .",
    "an alternative to the quantum state tomography is to perform a set of measurements to detect the amount of entanglement in the state .",
    "it is the main objective of this paper to investigate a passive measurement scheme for entanglement detection by analyzing the interference pattern of photons emitted by atoms .",
    "since entanglement and correlation are closely related to each other , a relationship between the interference visibility and entanglement in bipartite systems has been anticipated in the context of wave - particle duality @xcite .",
    "jacob and bergou observed that two - qubit concurrence is equivalent to two - particle interference visibility in the case of pure states @xcite .",
    "to be self - contained , let us consider a simplified argument for the known correspondence between the visibility and the concurrence by the detection of released photons in the far - field @xcite .",
    "consider two two - level atoms in which energy levels are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "assume an initial atomic state living in the subspace spanned by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 whose concurrence is @xmath5 .",
    "the spontaneous emission process of a single photon ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) occurs with equal probability but different phases . ignoring the details of the coupling between the atoms and the radiation field ,",
    "the standard michelson s visibility is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the maximum and the minimum of interference fringes , respectively , and the projection measurement of the phase @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate the visibility in this model as @xmath13 and this completes the claim @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that visibility here is not the two - particle visibility defined from a combination of correlation functions , which is shown to be equivalent to the concurrence of the pure state spanned by @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "several generalizations addressing the case of mixed states , of two qudits , and of multipartite qubits have also been reported recently @xcite . despite these progresses",
    ", there is still no net conclusive result on general multipartite systems .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that no generally accepted entanglement measure and no unique definition of interference visibility exist in multipartite systems .",
    "the former , for example , can be seen from the fact that none of these existing measures can be used to order the entangled states uniquely @xcite .",

    "we consider identical two - level atoms pinned at given positions and initially prepared in a superposition of the first excited states of the atoms . in the course of time",
    ", a photon is later released from the excited atom in any direction . in our setting ,",
    "quantum statistical effects play no role and complications related to the atomic motion , such as doppler and recoil effects , are avoided . in an experimental situation , this would be realized , for example , with atoms trapped in different potential wells in the lamb - dicke regime .",
    "another motivation of this work is to clarify the meaning of the standard interference visibility defined in two - path interferometers when it is applied to three - path interferometers . in ref .",
    "@xcite for example , it was shown that there is an infinite family of state functions which could be considered as equally good measures of the interference strength . in the present paper , however , rather than studying these many other alternatives , the usual standard definition is employed to examine what one can learn from it .",

    "section ii provides a brief summary for the known results on two two - level atoms interacting with the radiation field . in sec .",
    "iii the interference pattern is analyzed when the emitted photon is detected in the far - field and is compared with the entanglement present in the initial ( possibly mixed ) state .",
    "it is confirmed that the interference visibility converges to the concurrence when the spatial separation of the qubits goes to infinity . in sec .",

    "is considered and any polarization effects are neglected . fixing the origin of energy at the ground - state levels ( i.e. , at @xmath21 ) the free atoms - field hamiltonian @xmath22 for this case reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the annihilation and creation operators of a photon with momentum @xmath26 and angular frequency @xmath27 .",

    "the net effect of the interaction with the radiation field is to lift the degeneracy between the initial atomic states in the subspace @xmath41 .",

    "the new levels also acquire different finite lifetimes .",
    "the subspace @xmath41 is thus irreversibly emptied by spontaneous emission in the course of time while the ground state is gradually populated .",
    "both the degeneracy splitting and the lifetimes depend on the relative distance @xmath54 between the atoms . for sufficiently close atoms , the celebrated superradiant and subradiant behaviors are recovered in which the eigenstates are given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",

    "the radiation waves emitted by the two atoms interfere constructively and the system radiates more efficiently , shortening its lifetime . for @xmath56 ,",
    "on the other hand , the waves interfere destructively and the system can not radiate , increasing its lifetime .",

    "let us now proceed to verify the result ( [ con ] ) based on the microscopic model presented in the previous section . as before , consider the initial state ( [ state ] ) of atoms within the subspace spanned by @xmath43 and @xmath42 , and parametrize the density matrix as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are the components of the vector @xmath73 with the ranges @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",

    "complete state tomography is studied in sec .",
    "iii c. as a last remark , the angular separation between two consecutive fringes is inversely proportional to distance @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the further apart atoms are located , the more periodic and regular the fringe pattern appears .",
    "therefore , by knowing the distance between the two atoms , one does not need to measure the whole interference pattern for all angular positions .",
    "it is sufficient to record a few fringes to detect the amount of entanglement .      in this section ,",

    "the latter number can be used as a quantitative measure for the relationship between interference visibility and entanglement when estimating the amount of entanglement in the initial state from the observed visibility .",
    "first , from the result ( [ vis2 ] ) it can be seen that the deviation can be both positive and negative , and converges to zero in the limit @xmath103 as was shown in ( [ inflim ] ) .",
    "next , we numerically calculate the maximal value reached by @xmath110 as a function of @xmath54 ( in units of @xmath99 ) for some specific values of the state purity @xmath111 . to this end , the deviation @xmath110 is maximized over the state parameters @xmath112 , @xmath102 at fixed @xmath54 and @xmath113 . the frequency of the emitted photon is set at @xmath114 .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by frequency filtering in the detection process . without such filtering",

    "as one can see , the values of the local maxima are insensitive to the purity of the state whereas the values of the local minima increase monotonically when the purity of the state is increased .     as a function of @xmath54 ( in units of @xmath99 ) for different values of the purity @xmath111 .",

    ", the initial state @xmath100 describes a complete statistical mixture of the qubit states @xmath129 and @xmath130 and one can hardly imagine measuring interference fringes using a young slit device operating with one slit shut .",
    "the reason is that , due to the resonant exchange of photons between the atoms , the radiating eigenstates are _ not _ @xmath42 and @xmath43 but the superradiant and subradiant states @xmath131",
    ". the initial state at @xmath39 is also equivalent to a complete statistical mixture of @xmath53 , and both the superradiant and subradiant states display well - defined relative phases between the states @xmath129 and @xmath130 . both states @xmath53 lead to an interference pattern independently in the far - field , the dark fringes of one pattern corresponding to the bright fringes of the other and vice verse .",
    "in addition , these states decay with different rates .",
    "therefore the sum of their respective interference patterns does not average out except in the limit @xmath103 .",

    "the lorentzians are essentially identical and cancel out , and the interference is lost . in this limit , the intuitive result is recovered in which the radiation takes place starting from the complete statistical mixture of the qubit states @xmath129 and @xmath130 . for atoms that are close enough , however interference fringes do occur as the result of the overlap and partial blurring of two independent interference patterns , associated to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , with different strengths and fringe locations .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and eq .",
    ", large deviations between @xmath134 and @xmath135 appear for small separation of the atoms , typically in the region @xmath136 .",
    "however , the deviation can still be significant for atoms far apart as it only decays like @xmath137 for large spatial separations .",
    "it is straightforward to understand why the argument presented in the introduction to derive the relation between the visibility and concurrence applies to atoms that are far apart .",
    "concurrence relates to entanglement present in the atomic state @xmath100 spanned by the states @xmath129 , @xmath130 irrespective of the coupling to the radiation field while visibility refers to the interference pattern obtained by coupling the atoms to the radiation field ( i.e. , it relates to the interference pattern obtained from the radiating states @xmath53 ) .",
    "however , for atoms that are far apart , the resonant exchange of photons between the atoms is negligible and the interaction with the vacuum field does not lift the degeneracy of the subspace @xmath41 . as a consequence ,",
    "the eigenstructures to analyze radiation and entanglement are then essentially the same .",
    "this is why , for atoms that are far apart , the entanglement present in the initial state becomes equivalent to the visibility of the fringes .      in this section",

    ", the state parameter @xmath105 is obtained .",
    "similarly , knowing @xmath105 and using the values at @xmath145 , the combination of state parameters @xmath146 can be found .",

    "together with the obtained values of @xmath105 and @xmath146 provides @xmath106 and thus three state parameters @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "therefore the full vector @xmath73 is known , completing the state tomography .    the main result of this discussion is that spontaneously emitted photons from the excited states ( [ 2state ] ) do provide full information about the initial state as well as the amount of entanglement in it .",
    "the drawback of this tomographic scheme is that it is not very efficient .",
    "indeed , in the absence of any prior information on the initial state that could help simplify the state search , one needs to measure photons emitted in all directions to obtain the full fringe pattern and later characterize the state .",
    "this requires the repeated measurement of photons from an identically prepared state .",
    "although the method is not very practical , it can be combined with other proposals .",
    "for example , other possible entanglement detection schemes were studied by many authors . among them , we mention ref .",

    "in this section , we extend the previous analysis to the case of three atoms and investigate the relationship between the visibility and the various entanglement measures .",
    "this can be accomplished along the same lines of the microscopic calculation done for the two - atom system .",
    "as shown in the following , however , a complete analysis appears difficult .",
    "two major obstacles are shown in the following .",
    "the full diagonalization of the resolvent operator does not take a simple analytical form except for a few limited cases , for example , when the three atoms are pinned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle .",
    "even for such a special case , finding the extrema of the spectral distribution of photons is unlikely to be carried out by hand , and one needs to rely on numerical calculations in general .",
    "it is shown in the following that the large separation limit reduces the optimization problem significantly .",
    "therefore , we shall investigate the relations between interference visibility and various known entanglement measures for three - atom systems in this large separation limit .",

    "these jumps also exist in the three-@xmath117 case , and result in detecting the amount of entanglement around the full visibility with less accuracy .",
    "the appearance of these jumps is partly due to the fact that interference visibility defined by is a quantity closely related to a bipartite system whereas the mixedness of the subsystem and geometric measure are related to both bipartite and tripartite entanglement , and the three-@xmath117 is only related to tripartite entanglement .",
    "second , fig .",
    "[ fig2c ] shows that interference visibility can reasonably be used to detect the amount of bipartite entanglement in the w - like state for all values of interference visibility .",
    "remarkably , the upper bound is exactly equal to the largest amount of bipartite negativity with respect to all possible bipartite separations and does not show any jumps when the visibility approaches its maximal value @xmath197 from below .",
    "last , fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] clearly indicates that the interference visibility is a poor witness of the genuine tripartite entanglement initially present in the atomic system . in particular",
    ", getting a far - field interference pattern with full visibility @xmath197 does not tell anything at all about the least amount of tripartite entanglement initially present .",
    "this result is not really surprising since shows that the interference pattern directly depends on the products @xmath255 .",
    "as mentioned , these products identify with the concurrence of the two - atom reduced states obtained by tracing out one atom .",
    "it is thus obvious that the interference pattern perfectly encodes some bipartite entanglement properties of the atomic system , but is less sensitive to genuine tripartite entanglement properties .      in this last section , a state tomography",
    "is briefly discussed for the w - like states ( [ 3state ] ) from information contained in the far - field interference pattern by observing spontaneously emitted photons .",
    "the coefficients @xmath256 can be extracted simply by taking a few points of the interference pattern .",
    "because of the normalization condition of the state , one needs at least three different points to reconstruct the state .",
    "when the w - like initial state has complex coefficients @xmath257 , the full state tomography also needs to find the phases @xmath258 .",
    "since the global phase of the state is irrelevant @xmath259 can set to be real .",
    "the remaining phases @xmath260 and @xmath261 are incorporated in the interference pattern through the replacements @xmath262 ; @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 .",
    "this shows that these phases @xmath258 are merely responsible for a shift of the interference pattern . knowing the position of the fringes , one can extract @xmath260 and @xmath261 , thus completing the state tomography .",
    "we comment that a more complicated analysis is needed when the initial atomic state is mixed",
    ". the full tomography may well be possible when the atoms are separated by a distance on the order of optical atomic transition wavelength .",
    "in this paper , a system of two - level atoms has been considered when initially prepared in the subspace spanned by the first excited atomic states without photons and releasing a spontaneous photon in the course of time .",
    "some detailed analysis has been given about what kind of information the observation of the far - field interference pattern can help reveal on the amount of entanglement present in the initial atomic state .",
    "in the two - atom case , a previous known result is confirmed showing that the interference visibility indeed converges to the concurrence of the initial atomic state provided the two atomic qubits are far apart . for finite relative distances between the qubits ,",
    "the deviation of the visibility from the concurrence is calculated numerically .",
    "it is found that this deviation is small whenever the qubits are separated by a distance @xmath54 which is a multiple integer of half the wavelength @xmath99 associated to the optical atomic transition . a complete state tomography about the state is shown to be possible provided the two atoms are sufficiently close to each other .    in the three - atom case , the family of w - like states has been considered and the relations between the interference visibility and several known entanglement measures have been analyzed .",
    "bounds have been derived analytically for the amount of entanglement present in the initial state when the interference visibility is given .",
    "our results show that the interference visibility is closely related to the bipartite entanglement properties of the atoms .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the interference visibility is directly related to the maximal bipartite negativity .",
