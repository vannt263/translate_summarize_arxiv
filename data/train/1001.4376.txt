    "dynamics of curves and interfaces is a key ingredient in various important phenomena in physics and theories in mathematics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "special class of deformations of curves described by integrable equations has attracted a particular interest .",
    "it has been studied in a number of papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ approaches used in these papers differ , basically , by the way how the evolution of a curve is fixed . in papers @xcite the motion of the curve",
    "is defined by requirement that the time derivative of position vector of a curve is a linear superposition of tangent and ( bi)normal vectors with a certain specification of coefficients in this superposition .",
    "deformations considered in papers @xcite are defined , basically , by the corresponding lax pair . within the study of laplacian growth problem @xcite the time evolution of the interface",
    "is characterized by the dynamics of the schwartz function of a curve prescribed by the darcy law .",
    "semiclassical deformations of algebraic curves analyzed in @xcite are fixed by the existence of a specific generating function constructed @xmath0 a lenard scheme . finally , the coisotropic deformations introduced in @xcite are defined by the requirement that the ideal of the deformed curve is a poisson ideal .    in the present paper a novel class of deformations of plane curves",
    "is considered .",
    "for such deformations the function @xmath1 which defines a curve @xmath2 in the plane @xmath3 obeys an inhomogeneous liouville equation with @xmath4 and deformation parameters @xmath5 playing the role of independent variables .",
    "these deformations are referred as the hamiltonian deformations ( motions ) of a curve since the coefficients in the linear equation are completely fixed by the single function @xmath6 playing a role of hamiltonian for time @xmath7 dynamics .",
    "equivalently hamiltonian deformations can be defined as those for which an ideal @xmath8 of a deformed curve is invariant under the action of the vector field @xmath9 . for algebraic plane curves",
    "hamiltonian deformations represent a particular class of coisotropic deformations introduced in @xcite .    here",
    "we concentrate on the study of hamiltonian dynamics of plane quadrics ( conics ) and cubics .",
    "this dynamics is described by integrable systems of hydrodynamical type for the coefficients of polynomials defining algebraic curves with the dkdv , dds , dvn , ( 2 + 1)-dimensional one - layer benney system and other equations among them .",
    "it is shown that particular solutions of these systems describe formation of singularities ( cusps , nodes ) and bubbles on the real plane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "general definition and interpretations are given in section [ sect - defdef ] .",
    "hamiltonian deformations of plane quadrics are studied in section [ sect - quadr ] .",
    "as particular examples one has deformations of circle described by dispersionless veselov - novikov ( dvn ) equation and deformations of an ellipse given by a novel system of equations .",
    "section [ sect - cub ] is devoted to hamiltonian deformations of plane cubics .",
    "an analysis of formation of singularities for cubics and genus transition is given .",
    "in section @xmath10 a connection between singular cubics and burgers - hopf equation is considered . in section @xmath11 we discuss briefly deformations of a quintic .",
    "possible extensions of the approach presented in the paper are noted in section @xmath12 .",
    "so let the plane curve @xmath13 be defined by the equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a function of local coordinates @xmath4 on the complex plane @xmath16 . to introduce deformations of the curve ( [ gengamma ] ) we assume that @xmath15 depends also on the deformation parameters @xmath5 .    if the function @xmath17 obeys the equations @xmath18 with certain function @xmath19 and a function @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the poisson bracket @xmath22 then it is said that the function @xmath15 as the function of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath7 defines hamiltonian deformations of the curve ( [ gengamma ] ) .    to justify this definition",
    "we first observe that equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) is nothing else than inhomogeneous liouville equation which is well - known in classical mechanics . on @xmath25 the r.h.s . of equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) vanishes and ,",
    "hence , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hamiltonian vector field in the space with coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "thus hamiltonian deformations of the curve ( [ gengamma ] ) generated by @xmath29 can be equivalently defined as those for which the function @xmath15 obeys the condition ( [ gendefliouv ] ) .    following the standard interpretation of the liouville equation in the classical mechanics one can view equations ( [ defdefcurve ] ) and ( [ gendefliouv ] ) as @xmath30 and @xmath31 where the total derivative @xmath32 is calculated along the characteristics of equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) defined by hamiltonian equations @xmath33    for a given irreducible curve @xmath13 ( @xmath34 ) a function @xmath20 is not defined uniquely .",
    "indeed , for any function @xmath35 the function @xmath36 defines the same curve ( [ gengamma ] ) .",
    "then , equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 while the condition ( [ gendefliouv ] ) remains unchanged .",
    "thus , the freedom in form of @xmath20 given by ( [ alpha - gauge ] ) is just a gauge type freedom . for given @xmath20 the choice of @xmath39 as a solution of the equation @xmath40 gives @xmath41 .",
    "so there exists a gauge at which equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) is homogeneous one .",
    "the drawback of such `` gauge '' is that in many cases equation ( [ gengamma ] ) has no simple , standard form in this gauge .",
    "gauge freedom observed above becomes very natural in the formulation based on the notion of ideal of a curve .",
    "ideal @xmath42 of an irreducible curve ( [ gengamma ] ) consists of all functions of the form @xmath43 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these terms",
    "hamiltonian deformations of a curve can be characterized equivalently by    hamiltonian deformations of a curve generated by a function @xmath29 are those for which the ideal @xmath8 of the deformed curve is closed under the action of the vector field @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath44    definition of the hamiltonian deformation in this form clearly shows the irrelevance of the concrete form of function @xmath20 in equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) .",
    "moreover such formulation reveals also the nonuniqueness in the form of @xmath29 for the same deformation .",
    "indeed , for the family of hamiltonians @xmath45 where @xmath46 is arbitrary element of @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) one has equation ( [ defdefcurve ] ) with the family of functions @xmath48 of the form @xmath49 .",
    "hence , equations @xmath50 and @xmath51 and corresponding equations ( [ defdefideal ] ) coincide .",
    "this freedom ( @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an arbitrary function ) in the choice of hamiltonians is associated with different possible evaluations of @xmath29 on the curve @xmath13 . in practice",
    "it corresponds to different possible resolutions of the concrete equation ( [ gengamma ] ) with respect to one of the variables ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) . this freedom serves to choose simplest and most convenient form of hamiltonian @xmath29 .    for algebraic curves ,",
    "i.e. for functions @xmath15 polynomial in @xmath4 , hamiltonian deformations of plane curves represent themselves a special subclass of coisotropic deformations of algebraic curves in three dimensional space considered in @xcite .    in three dimensional space",
    "the curve @xmath13 is defined by the system of two equations @xmath56 where @xmath57 are deformation parameters .",
    "its coisotropic deformation is fixed by the condition @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the canonical poisson bracket in @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to see that with the choices @xmath61 , and @xmath62 the condition ( [ ko - cond ] ) is reduced to ( [ gendefliouv ] ) where @xmath63 .",
    "+ in general , hamiltonian deformations of the plane curve are parameterized by three independent variables @xmath64 , and @xmath7 . if one variable is cyclic ( say @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath65 and , hence , @xmath66 ) then deformations are described by @xmath67 dimensional equations",
    "in the rest of the paper we will consider hamiltonian deformations of complex algebraic plane curves . we begin with quadrics defined by equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 are functions of the deformation parameters @xmath5 . choosing @xmath70",
    "one gets the system of six equations of hydrodynamical type .",
    "this system has several interesting reductions .",
    "one is associated with the constraint @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath20 and @xmath39 are constants .",
    "it is given by the system @xmath74 at @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 it is the @xmath78 dimensional generalization of the one - layer benney system proposed in @xcite @xmath79 the curve @xmath13 is the hyperbola @xmath80 and the solutions of the system ( [ 1layerb - def ] ) describe deformations of the hyperbola .",
    "the simplest solution of the system is given by @xmath81 the corresponding evolution of the hyperbola is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hyp ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there are also various regimes of formation of singularities and bubbles ( included the cusp @xmath82 ) described by the system ( [ kdv - g2 ] )",
    ".    for higher order hyperelliptic curves of genus @xmath83 one observes processes of formation of @xmath83 bubbles .",
    "the burgers - hopf ( dkdv ) hierarchy , again , is relevant for description of the singular sectors of these transition regimes .",
    "the process of regularization of corresponding singular curves via the transition to higher birkhoff strata in sato grassmannian and its connection with results of the papers @xcite will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "approach formulated in the present paper allows us also to introduce a novel class of deformations for the , so called , quadrature ( algebraic ) domains on the plane . quadrature domains ( @xmath84 ) on the plane are those for which an integral of any function @xmath85 over this domain is the linear superposition of values of the @xmath85 and its derivatives in a finite number of points ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such domains show up in many problems of mathematics and fluid mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a particular property of quadrature domains is that their boundaries @xmath86 are algebraic curves .",
    "any hamiltonian deformation of the boundary @xmath86 generates a special class of deformations of quadrature domains .",
    "one can refer to such deformations as the hamiltonian ( or coisotropic ) deformations of quadrature domains .",
    "the study of the properties of such deformations , for instance , the analysis of deformations of the quadrature domain data is definitely of interest .",
    "finally we note that the hamiltonian deformations can be defined for surfaces and hypersurfaces too .",
    "indeed , let a hypersurface in @xmath87 be defined by the equation @xmath88 introducing deformation parameters @xmath89 , one may define hamiltonian deformations of a hypersurface ( [ hypersurf ] ) by the formulae ( [ defdefcurve]),([stdpoiss]),([gendefliouv ] ) passing from two to @xmath90 variables @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for algebraic surfaces ( @xmath93 ) and hypersurfaces",
    "such deformations are described by the systems of equations of hydrodynamical type .",
    "properties of such systems and corresponding hamiltonian deformations are worth to study .",
