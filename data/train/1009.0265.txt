    "the exact beta function of a gauge theory is generally considered to contain many non - perturbative _ secrets _ of the gauge theory behavior .",

    "another object in gauge theories with massless fermions , the divergence of the u(1 ) axial vector current , should be zero in the classical limit but is known not to vanish at the quantum level ( axial anomaly ) .",
    "most interestingly it has the property that there are no corrections @xcite beyond the one loop level so it can be considered to be known exactly .",
    "now , in supersymmetric gauge theories , it was found @xcite that both the trace anomaly and the axial anomaly ( actually together with the divergence of a special superconformal current ) belong to the same chiral multiplet and hence should be somehow related to each other . there was",
    "a lot of discussion about the meaning of this feature - for example is there a contradiction between an exact one loop result for the axial anomaly and a result containing all orders of coupling constant for the trace anomaly - and finally it was realized that there could be compatibility , with the exact beta function being determined from the axial anomaly .",
    "this was shown both for the supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite and for the supersymmetric theory containing also fermions not belonging to the adjoint representation @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of these exact beta functions is a pole at a particular value of coupling constant , g in the beta function @xmath4 .",

    "these beta functions also feature a pole at a particular value of g.    in the present note , we study some non - pertubative consequences of the conjectured beta function for the simple su(n ) yang - mills theory ; already @xcite the conjectured beta function had been seen to give a reasonable picture in the asymptotically free perturbative region . in section",
    "ii we use dimensional analysis to investigate the running with scale of physical quantities with various engineering dimensions .",

    "we investigate the integration of the defining equation for the beta function which yields an explicit expression for @xmath1 .",
    "we consider all yang - mills theories in the sense that a full range of values for the coupling constant at a reference mass are considered .",
    "an amusing feature is seen to arise : the solutions for @xmath1 do not allow @xmath2 to be lower than a certain value . we interpret this as the measure of the mass gap for the yang - mills theory .",
    "for the usual value of the qcd coupling constant , with n=3 , our predicted value of 1.67 gev is seen to be in good agreement with a valence lattice calculation .",

    "now , as discussed in the preceding section , a conjectured all orders beta function for the ordinary yang - mills theory based on the known supersymmetric yang - mills theory all orders beta function was recently introduced in @xcite by ryttov and sannino .",

    "we also note the interesting fact that for a given value of the _ physical _ quantity @xmath29 , there are two different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the situation will be further explored by looking at the beta function .",

    ", it is convenient to choose @xmath31 = @xmath33 91.19 gev . for illustration we will also choose this value of @xmath31 as our reference scale .",
    "the value of the qcd coupling constant at this scale is measured to be about 1.228 . in the present pure yang - mills case we are dealing with a hypothetical model so we are free to choose any value for @xmath32 .",
    "in fact it is better to allow @xmath32 to range over all possible values , which corresponds to describing all pure yang - mills n=3 theories .",
    "clearly , the first step is finding out how the coupling constant runs with the scale @xmath2 . integrating the second of eq.([main ] ) yields the following relation between @xmath0 = @xmath1 and @xmath34 corresponding to any choice of @xmath35 = @xmath32 :    @xmath36    it is convenient to plot in fig .",

    "there is no discontinuity at the pole . clearly , this behavior is the same as that shown for _ physical quantities _ in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the existence of a smoothly connected different _",
    "phase _ for the theory is intriguing .",
    "for the present , however , we will concentrate on the asymptotically free region .",
    "the different @xmath25 = 3 pure yang - mills theory which is defined by @xmath40 yields the running coupling constant plotted in fig .",
    "the overall picture is substantially the same . in particular ,",

    "similarly the theory characterized by @xmath42 is seen from the plot in fig .",
    "3(b ) to still have the same range in @xmath1 for the asymptotically free region , but with rather different @xmath2 values .    figures 2(b ) , 3(a ) and 3(b ) each illustrate that there is a particular ( but different in each case ) value of @xmath14 below which the curve does not extend .",
    "this is peculiar since it would imply that the running coupling constant could not be _ measured experimentally _ in that region .",
    "the only way in which this might be consistent is if the disallowed region would be lower than @xmath43 , twice the mass of the lightest glueball state in the theory",
    ". then it would be below threshold and not accessible to experiment",
    ". that seems like a plausible determination of the _ mass gap _ of the theory .",
    "it is clear that the value of such a mass gap is determined by the ordinate of the point where @xmath14 is minimum , i.e. where @xmath44 . specifically ,     +    @xmath45    where @xmath35 is the assumed value of the coupling constant at @xmath31 = 91.19 gev .",
    "note that the so defined mass gap depends on the particular n=3 yang - mills theory we are considering via its dependence on @xmath35 . in figure  [ figmassgap ]  ( a ) twice the mass gap ,",
    "m in gev is plotted for @xmath35 ranging from 1 to 10 . for orientation ,",
    "the mass gap for @xmath35 slightly larger than one is seen to be in the gev range .",
    "the mass gap reaches a maximum when @xmath35 takes the _ pole _ value , @xmath46 and declines somewhat for larger values of @xmath35 .",
    "it seems reasonable that within the asymptotically free regime , the mass gap increases with the strength of the coupling constant , @xmath35 . for @xmath47 1 ,",
    "the mass gap starts to decline extremely rapidly , as may be seen from fig .",
    "[ figmassgap ]  ( b ) .",
    "+    to further test the reasonableness of our interpretation , we may try to predict the mass of the lightest glueball in this model .",
    "we would like the result to be similar to the usually expected value ( about 1.5 gev ) when we adopt the qcd value for the coupling constant , @xmath35 = 1.228 , mentioned above .",
    "this would correspond to neglecting the effects of quark fields on the glueball mass . since it is seen that there is a rapid dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath35 we give in fig .",
    "[ figgap ] a _ blow up _ of the prediction for @xmath48 in the region of @xmath35 near the experimental one . this yields for the lightest glueball mass , @xmath49 which does seem reasonable for an a priori prediction .",
    "we may compare this value with the result of a lattice qcd calculation employing a _ valence _",
    "assumption @xcite .",
    "that calculation gave the result for the @xmath50 glueball which is found to be lightest : @xmath51 this embarassingly accurate agreement gives us at least some confidence in the correctness of the interpretation of the mass gap and the validity of the rs conjectured beta function .",
    "other lattice results are also in agreement with the value quoted above @xcite . to sum up",
    ", the pole in the beta function does not produce any singularity in the theory but seems to be the feature which generates the mass gap .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the dependence of this result on the choice of renormalization scheme .",
    "for @xmath52  gev and @xmath53 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    if the conjectured pure yang - mills beta function could be shown to be the same as the exact one , it would amount to showing that the theory has the kind of mass gap defined above .",
    "actually , it is easy to see that this mass gap mechanism does not , in general , require the rs conjecture if one goes beyond the ordinary yang - mills model . that is because the supersymmetric yang - mills theory , which is of course the starting point of the rs conjecture , is known to possess an exact beta function of the same form as eq.([rs ] ) but with somewhat different values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , namely :    @xmath56    the numerical results are qualitatively similar if one assumes a similar value of the coupling constant .",
    "for example if we choose to specify the super yang - mills theory by taking a similar coupling constant at the scale , @xmath57 , we would get for the choice @xmath58 , the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ figsusy ] , which describes the running of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath14 and can be compared with the curve in fig .",
    "we can compare the mass gap , @xmath59 in the supersymmetric case by using eq.([massgap ] ) and making the choice @xmath35 = 1.228 ( and also n=3 ) .",
    "this would give for the mass of the lightest supersymmetric multiplet ,    @xmath60    clearly , the supersymmetric and non supersymmetric yang - mills model results seem to be only qualitatively similar , the lightest supersymmetric particle having a mass about 1/3 that of the non - supersymmetric model glueball ( assuming the same coupling constant ) .",
    "of course , another interesting aspect to explore for gauge theories is their behavior as the number of colors , n gets large . taking the supersymmetric gauge theory as an example and fixing , for the sake of definiteness , the gauge coupling constant as 1.228 at @xmath31 = 91.19 gev",
    ", we find the running of @xmath1 by substituting eq.([susyparam ] ) into eq.([gruns ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figndep ]  ( a ) show @xmath14 plotted against @xmath1 for respectively n=3 ( blue solid line ) , n=15 ( red dashed line ) and n=100 ( black dot - dashed line ) .",
    "it is seen that the asymptotically free ( left ) region in @xmath0 shrinks as n increases .",
    "furthermore , the mass gap ( corresponding to the ordinate at the minimum point ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figndep ]  ( b ) .",
    "it shows that the mass gap has a maximum as function of the number of colors .",
    "when considering the large n behavior of gauge theories it is often desired to make an extrapolation where large n is taken in such a way that the quantity ,     for the super yang - mills theory .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    @xmath61    is held fixed .",
    "with such an extrapolation there will be no dependence ( in either the supersymmetric yang - mills or the pure yang - mills with rs type beta function cases ) on n. this may be immediately seen by writing , from eq.([rs ] ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 are independent of n. then , as an example , eq.([massgap ] ) for the mass gap becomes    @xmath66    which only involves n via the fixed combination @xmath67 .",
    "first , an exploration of the scale dependence of physical quantities ( with engineering dimension , @xmath9 ) was made using dimensional analysis and a specific form , conjectured by ryttov and sannino , of the beta function for the pure yang - mills theory .",
    "it was noted that even though the beta function had a pole ( inherited from the known form for supersymmetric gauge theories which stimulated the conjecture ) physical quantities remained smooth as the pole value of the coupling constant , @xmath0 was crossed .    for a more detailed understanding of how the coupling constant runs , the integration of the beta function",
    "was next carried out for the complete set of su(3 ) yang - mills theories , i.e. those corresponding to any choice of coupling constant , @xmath35 at a convenient reference scale , @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath1 was also seen to have a smooth behavior at the pole value of g. most interesting is that ( due to the existence of the pole ) the curve of @xmath1 predicts a numerical value for the mass gap of the yang - mills theory , i.e. the mass of the lightest glueball .",
    "the predicted value , 1.67 gev , seems rather close to the one obtained from a lattice treatment of qcd in the valence or quenched approximation .",
    "a similar treatment was carried out for the supersymmetric su(3 ) yang - mills theory and the mass gap was calculated to be about 0.49 gev . in this case , the form of the beta function is quite similar but is based on a known rather than a conjectured beta function .",
