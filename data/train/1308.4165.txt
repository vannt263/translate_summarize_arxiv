    ". the point spread function full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath39 between 55@xmath1 m  and 110@xmath1 m , and increases to about @xmath40 by 200@xmath1 m .",

    "observations were done in range spectroscopy mode .",
    "we used optical narrow - line redshifts to set the central wavelengths of each range scan . for one object , iras07598 + 6508",
    ", the input coordinates were incorrect , placing the source near the edge of the pacs array , thus making the flux determination uncertain .",
    "we therefore substituted observations of this source from other programs . for [ ] , we used the dataset 1342243534 ( pi weedman ) , and for [ ] we used the dataset 1342231959 ( pi veilleux ) .",
    "we set the wavelength range of each range scan to accomodate uncertainties such as offsets between optical and far - ir line redshifts , and asymmetric or broadened lines .",
    "the chop / nod observation mode was used , in which the source is observed by alternating between the on - source position and a clean off - source position . since the extent of the targets is always @xmath42 , the smallest throw ( @xmath43 )",
    "was used to reduce the effect of field - rotation between the two chop positions .",
    "two nod positions were used in order to eliminate the telescope background emission .",
    "the data reduction was performed in the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ) version ` 8.0 ` @xcite using the default chop / nod pipeline script .",
    "the level one products ( calibrated in flux and in wavelength , with bad pixel masks from hipe ) were then exported , and processed by the pacsman tool @xcite .                  the best method to determine a line flux depends on the position and morphology of the line - emitting regions within the pacs footprint .",
    "if their combined spatial extent is significantly smaller than a single spaxel , are well centered on the central spaxel , and _ herschel _ maintains accurate pointing ( the pointing accuracy of _ herschel _ is @xmath44 ) then the best flux measurement is that of the central spaxel , scaled by an appropriate point - source correction .",
    "we call this method ` @xmath45 ' . if these conditions are not satisfied then @xmath45 will give a lower limit on the flux .",
    "we do not know , _ a priori _ , the morphologies of the far - ir line emitting regions , since high spatial resolution images of this emission do not exist .",
    "moreover , we can not assume that the morphologies of these regions are traced reliably by emission at other wavelengths .",
    "we therefore are unable to straightforwardly distinguish between scenarios such as the source being centered and spatially extended , against the source being off - center and pointlike .",
    "finally , we can not assume that the morphologies of different lines in the same object are similar , since the line strengths are governed by different excitation temperatures and critical densities .",
    "given these caveats , there are five further methods to determine a line flux :    * @xmath46 - fit line profiles to the central 3@xmath473 spaxels individually , sum the resulting fluxes , and apply a point - source correction ( of order 15% or less of the total flux ) that accounts for the additional areal sampling of the psf .",
    "this method is suitable if the source is spatially extended or shifted by at most a significant fraction of a spaxel .",
    "the point - source correction is wavelength - dependent , but since our range scans span wavelength ranges of order 1@xmath1 m it is equivalent to either calculate the flux and then apply the correction , or apply the correction to the spectrum and then calculate the flux .",
    "* @xmath48 - co - add the spectra of the central 3@xmath473 spaxels , apply a point - source correction , and fit a line profile to the combined profile .",
    "this method is identical to @xmath46 , except for additional uncertainties from combining spectra with different shaped continua .",
    "we mention this method for completeness but do not use it . * @xmath49 - fit line profiles to those spaxels with a line detection , then sum the resulting fluxes .",
    "this is appropriate if the source is extended in any fashion , but suffers from uncertainties due to imperfect knowledge of the source morphology .",
    "* @xmath50 - fit line profiles to every spaxel in the pacs array and sum them . the point - source correction for this method is negligible .",
    "this method will capture all of the line flux , but will have overestimated uncertainties unless the source is both bright _ and _ extended across at least most of the pacs field - of - view . *",
    "@xmath51 - fit a psf , as a function of position and intensity , across the whole pacs array and adopt the best fit .",
    "this is a photometric equivalent of ` optimal ' extraction as described in @xcite .    to choose the method for the lines in each source we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we determine all six measurements for each line",
    ". if the emission is consistent with a well - centered point source , then the fluxes from all six methods will agree with each other , with larger errors for the methods that include more spaxels .",
    "we found this to be so in the majority of the sample .",
    "for these , we adopted @xmath45 .",
    "for the others , the measurements from @xmath46 through @xmath52 were higher than @xmath45 , but were consistent with each other .",
    "this indicates that the line emission is mostly confined to the central 3@xmath473 spaxels .",
    "we therefore discarded @xmath50 . to avoid uncertainties in using a simulated psf , we then used in most cases the measurements from @xmath46 rather than @xmath49 or @xmath52 , even though the @xmath46 errors are larger . in most cases , for each object , the same measurement method was used for all lines . in a few cases though [ ]",
    "is extended while the other lines are consistent with point sources .    for one object , iras 00397 - 1312 , [ ]",
    "is redshifted such that it lies in a part of the pacs wavelength range that suffers from significant flux leakage . in this wavelength range , which spans approximately 190@xmath1 m to 210@xmath1 m ,",
    "there is superimposed emission from the second order , at 95 - 110@xmath1 m . since [ ] in iras",
    "00397 - 1312 was observed with spire , we substitute the spire - fts measurement for this line .    except for [ ] in iras 00397 - 1312 , line fits were performed with pacsman for each spaxel at each raster position , using all points in the data cloud .",
    "errors were estimated from the dispersion of the cloud in each wavelength bin .",
    "the fitting function was a gaussian profile , adjusted simultaneously with a polynomial continuum of degrees one to three .",
    "the instrument spectral resolution ranges from @xmath53kms@xmath3  to @xmath54kms@xmath3  depending on the band , order and wavelength .",
    "the intrinsic line broadening fwhm was calculated by calculating the quadratic difference between the observed fwhm and the instrumental fwhm , assuming gaussian profiles .     for discussion .",
    "objects with errors on their widths exceeding 30@xmath55 are not plotted .",
    "the open black circles show the ( weighted ) mean and error for each line .",
    "the line widths are corrected for instrumental broadening.,width=321 ]",
    "we tabulate the far - infrared line properties in table [ linefluxc ] , and present their profiles in figures [ spectra1 ] , [ spectra2 ] , and [ spectra3 ] . in the following analysis we frequently compare the far - ir line properties to those of the mid - ir fine - structure lines @xcite ,",
    "the 6.2@xmath1 m and 11.2@xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features , and the 9.7@xmath1 m silicate feature ( table [ midflux ] ) .",
    "the pah and silicate feature data were measured from spectra taken from the cassis v4 database @xcite .",
    "the pah luminosities were measured by integrating over 5.9 - 6.6@xmath1 m and 10.8 - 11.8@xmath1 m in the continuum subtracted spectra , respectively @xcite . for the silicate feature ,",
    "we define its strength , @xmath56 , as :    @xmath57\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 is the observed flux at rest - frame 9.7@xmath1 m and @xmath59 is the continuum flux at rest - frame 9.7@xmath1 m in the absence of silicate absorption , inferred from a spline fit to the continuum at 5 - 7@xmath1 m and 14 - 14.5@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "a positive value corresponds to silicates in absorption .            in most cases the lines are reproducible by single gaussians with widths between 250kms@xmath3  and 600kms@xmath3 .",
    "we do not see greater widths in the higher ionization lines .",
    "we also do not see strong asymmetries , or systemic offsets in velocity ( compared to the optical redshift ) of any line . in a few cases the line profiles are not reproducible with single symmetric profiles .",
    "the [ ] 63 lines in two objects , iras 06206@xmath606315 and iras 20414 - 1651 are consistent with significant self - absorption ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there is weaker evidence for [ ] 63 self absorption in iras 00188 - 0856 , iras 11095 - 0238 , and iras 19254 - 7245 .",
    "self - absorption in [ ] 63 can occur when cool oxygen in foreground clouds reduces the [ ] 63 flux @xcite .",
    "the [ ] profiles in iras 20087 - 0308 , iras 20414 - 4651 and iras 23253 - 5415 may show subtle asymmetries .",
    "finally , in four cases ( iras 06035 - 7102 , mrk 463 , iras 11095 - 0238 , and iras 20100 - 4156 ) , [ ] may show an additional , broad emission component with widths between 600kms@xmath3  and 1200kms@xmath3 .",
    "for consistency with the other lines we do not include the broad component in the line fluxes in table [ linefluxc ] , but discuss it instead in a future paper .",
    "we examine the distribution of line widths , using only the narrow components in those cases where an additional broad one exists , in figure [ linewidths ] . the range in widths of all six lines",
    "are consistent with each other .",
    "we see no dependence of the range in widths on optical class . for individual objects though there are sometimes substantial differences between individual line widths .",
    "in mrk 1014 for example the [ ] and [ ] line widths differ by nearly a factor of two .",
    "we speculate that these differences are due to one or more of ( a ) differences in the critical densities of the lines , ( b ) that an individually unresolved broad component in one line is brighter than the equivalent component in the other line , and ( c ) in the case of [ ] and [ ] , that the [ ] emission arises mostly from regions , while at least some of the [ ] emission arises from photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) or the diffuse ism .",
    "it is however also possible that the [ ] profile is affected by the @xmath61 transition of o - h@xmath62o at 121.72@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "we discuss this in @xcite .          we plot luminosities of selected individual lines against each other in figure [ firlumvsfirlum1 ] .",
    "the line luminosities range from just under @xmath63l@xmath5 to @xmath64l@xmath5 .",
    "the [ ] or [ ] 63 lines are usually the most luminous lines , though the [ ] line may be the second most luminous in 3c273 and iras 00397 - 1312 .",
    "the least luminous two lines are in most cases [ ] and [ ] 145 . in some cases [ ]",
    "is consistent with being the least luminous , and in a few cases ( e.g. iras 07598 + 6508 iras 23253 - 5415 ) [ ] is consistent with being the least luminous .",
    "the range in luminosities decreases approximately with increasing wavelength ; the [ ] and [ ] line luminosities span a factor of @xmath65 , whereas the [ ] luminosity spans only a factor of five , less than the range in l@xmath6 of the sample .    to determine if the line luminosities correlate with each other , we fit the relation in equation [ baserelation ] ( see  [ linelumsdisc ] for methodology ) .",
    "we find positive correlations in all cases , with @xmath66 values mostly between 0.5 and 1.2 . in no case",
    "however is the correlation particularly strong ( in terms of the s / n on @xmath66 ) .",
    "we find that , among these six lines , the luminosity of one can not be used to predict the luminosity of another to better than @xmath67dex .",
    "if we instead plot line luminosities normalized by l@xmath6 ( figure [ normfirlumvsfirlum1 ] ) then the correlations do not change significantly . neither",
    "do they depend on optical spectral type .",
    "one object , iras 01003 - 2238 , may have an unusually low [ ] luminosity .",
    "the six line measurement methods for [ ] in this object are in reasonable agreement , despite the low s / n .",
    "we therefore do not have a good explanation for this . the only other way in which iras 01003 - 2238 is atypical is that its optical spectrum contains wolf - rayet star features @xcite but we do not see why this would affect the [ ] luminosity .    finally , we comment briefly on two line ratios . first is [ ] 145/[]63 , which is related to the physical conditions in pdrs .",
    "this ratio ( note the inverse is plotted in figure [ firlumvsfirlum1 ] ) depends on both the gas temperature and density .",
    "it decreases with decreasing gas temperature , and decreases with _ increasing _ gas density if the density is above the critical density . in a diffuse pdr illuminated by intense uv radiation , the expected [ ] ratio lies below @xmath68 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . from figure 5 ,",
    "several of our sample have [ ] ratios above 0.1 .",
    "a likely reason for this is self absorption of [ ] 63 , or a higher optical depth in [ ] 63 than [ o i]145 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second is the [ ] / [ ] ratio , which can be used to estimate the relative contribution of [ ] arising in pdrs and in the ionized gas .",
    "while [ ] arises almost entirely from regions , [ ] can additionally arise from pdrs and the diffuse ism ( cold neutral , warm neutral , and warm diffuse ionized ) .",
    "the [ ] / [ ] ratio can therefore quantify the contribution to [ ] from the ionized gas , by comparing the observed [ ] / [ ] ratio with theoretical expectations from a photoionized nebula .",
    "the expected ratio in the ionized gas lies between 0.2 and 2.0 depending on density ( e.g. , figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the ratios in our sample are however nearly all below 0.25 .",
    "this indicates that a significant fraction of the [ ] emission originates from photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "a precise estimate is however hampered by lack of knowledge on the ionized gas density .",
    "we compare far - ir line luminosities to l@xmath6 in figure [ firlinlumvslirfits ] .",
    "qualitatively , some of the line luminosities crudely correlate with l@xmath6 , with greater scatter among the sy1s . to determine if correlations exist between l@xmath6 and l@xmath69 , we assume that l@xmath6 and l@xmath69 are related by :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath66 are free parameters .",
    "we fit this relation following the method of @xcite . for a correlation to exist",
    ", we require that @xmath72 at @xmath73 significance .",

    "* ) , leading to a lower gas heating efficiency , ( 2 ) a softer radiation field in the diffuse ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
