    "a brownian excursion @xmath9 is a conditioned one dimensional brownian motion over the time interval @xmath10 such that its path starts and ends at the origin @xmath11 , but is constrained to stay positive in between ( see fig .",
    "the area under the excursion , @xmath12 , is clearly a random variable taking a different value for each realization of the excursion .",
    "a natural question that the mathematicians have studied quite extensively over the past two decades is : what is the probability distribution @xmath13 of the area under a brownian excursion over the interval @xmath14 $ ] ?",
    "since the typical lateral displacement of the excursion at time @xmath15 scales as @xmath16 , it follows that one can trivially rescale @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents a brownian excursion over the unit interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "hence , the area @xmath20 scales as @xmath21 .",
    "thus the area distribution has a scaling form , @xmath22 . the normalization condition @xmath23 demands a prefactor @xmath24 and also the conditions : @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "one then interprets the scaling function @xmath5 as the distribution of the area under the brownian excursion @xmath18 over a _ unit _ interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath5 , or rather its laplace transform , was first computed analytically by darling@xcite and louchard@xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 s are the magnitudes of the zeros of the standard airy function @xmath30 on the negative real axis .",
    "for example , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 etc .",
    "since the expression of @xmath5 involves the zeros of airy function , the function @xmath5 has been named the airy distribution function , which should not be confused with the airy function @xmath34 itself . even though the eq .",
    "( [ airy1 ] ) provides a formally exact expression of the laplace transform , it turns out the calculation of the moments @xmath35 is highly nontrivial and they can be determined only recursively@xcite ( see section ii ) .",
    "takacs was also able to formally invert the laplace transform in eq .",
    "( [ airy1 ] ) to obtain@xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the confluent hypergeometric function@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath5 has the asymptotic tails@xcite , @xmath39 a plot of this function , obtained by evaluating the sum in eq .",
    "( [ fx1 ] ) using the mathematica , is provided in fig . 1 .",
    "so , why would anyone care about such a complicated function ?",
    "the reason behind the sustained interest and study@xcite of this function @xmath5 seems to be the fact that it keeps resurfacing in a number of seemingly unrelated problems , mostly in computer science and graph theory [ for a list of such problems see @xcite ] .",
    "for example , the function @xmath5 describes the distribution of the cost of the construction of a linear table for data storage using the linear probing with random hashing algorithm@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath5 also describes the distribution of the total path length in catalan trees@xcite .",
    "the generating function for the number of inversions in trees involves the airy distribution function @xmath5@xcite . also , the moments @xmath40 s of the function @xmath5 appear in the enumeration of the connected components in a random graph@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been conjectured and subsequently tested numerically that the asymptotic distribution of the area of two dimensional self - avoiding polygons is also given by the airy distribution function @xmath5@xcite .",
    "besides , numerical evidence suggests that the area enclosed by the outer boundary of planar random loops is also distributed according to the airy distribution function @xmath5@xcite .",
    "given the widespread occurrence of this function @xmath5 in various combinatorial problems , it is natural to ask whether this function also appears in a more realistic physical system .",
    "in a recent letter@xcite , we have demonstrated that indeed this airy distribution function also appears in a rather well studied physical system , namely the one dimensional fluctuating interfaces .",
    "fluctuating interfaces have been widely studied over the last two decades as they appear in a variety of physical systems such as growing crystals , molecular beam epitaxy , fluctuating steps on metals and growing bacterial colonies@xcite .",
    "the past theoretical efforts mostly concentrated in characterizing the universal scaling properties of the surface roughness measured via the average width of the surface .",
    "this average roughness , however , fails to measure the possible extreme fluctuations which , though rare , may play an important role under many situations .",
    "for example , extreme fluctuations play a significant role in batteries where a short circuit may occur if the highest point of the metal surface on one electrode reaches the one on the opposite electrode .",
    "there is also a compelling theoretical motivation for studying the extreme fluctuations .",
    "while the extreme value statistics is well understood for a set of _ independent _ random variables@xcite , it becomes nontrivial when the random variables are _ correlated_. the extreme value problems associated with correlated variables have appeared recently in a variety of problems ranging from disordered systems@xcite to a number of computer science problems that include the growing search trees@xcite and the networks@xcite .",
    "a fluctuating interface is an ideal candidate for studying the extreme statistics of correlated variables since the heights at two different points on the interface are correlated .",
    "a knowledge of the distribution of their maximum ( or minimum ) may possibly provide important insights into this important general class of extreme value problems of correlated variables .",
    "motivated by these observations , raychaudhury et .",
    "al.@xcite recently proposed to study the statistics of the global maximal relative height ( mrh ) ( measured with respect to the spatially averaged growing height ) of a fluctuating @xmath41-dimensional interface . by @xmath41-dimensional",
    "interface one means an interface characterized by a scalar height function @xmath42 growing over a linear substrate . for a substrate of finite size @xmath2 , the system reaches a stationary state in the long time limit . in this stationary state ,",
    "the mrh @xmath1 is expected to scale as the surface roughness , @xmath43 for large @xmath2 , where @xmath44 is the roughness exponent .",
    "this suggests , quite generically , a scaling form for the normalized probability distribution of the mrh , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a scaling function .",
    "this was demonstrated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite for a one dimensional lattice model belonging to the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) universality class@xcite .",
    "further , it was argued that the scaling function @xmath46 is sensitive to the boundary conditions@xcite .    in our previous letter",
    "@xcite , using path integral techniques , we presented an exact solution of the stationary mrh distribution @xmath47 for the @xmath41-dimensional ew model , with both periodic and free boundary conditions . for the periodic case",

    "the same scaling was found to hold though the scaling function was different from that of the periodic case .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold : ( i ) to provide detailed derivations of various results that were just announced in ref.@xcite and ( ii ) to extend our results to other systems such as the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) interface@xcite .",
    "our main results , along with a layout of the paper , are summarized below .    1 .   in section ii - a , we provide a new physical derivation , using methods of path integral , of the distribution of the area under a brownian excursion .",

    "iv - a in the context of the mrh distribution of an ew interface with periodic boundary condition . in section ii - b ,",
    "we derive the distribution of the area under a brownian meander ( a brownian meander is a one dimension brownian motion @xmath9 over the time interval @xmath49 that is pinned to the origin at one end @xmath50 , but is free at the other end at @xmath51 , and is constrained to stay positive in between ) . these results for the brownian meander will be used later to discuss the mrh distribution of an ew interface with free boundary condition in sec .",
    "the section ii can be read independently of the rest of the paper and the results here are interesting by themselves .",
    "section iii includes a detailed derivation of various correlation functions in the ew model in two opposite regimes : ( a ) * growing regime * where the correlation length of the interface @xmath52 ( @xmath53 being the dynamical exponent ) is less than the system size , @xmath54 and ( b ) * stationary regime * when @xmath55 and thus the joint probablity distribution of height fluctuations become time independent .",

    "we conclude in section vii with a summary , experimental consequences of our results and some open questions .",
    "in this section , we provide a new derivation , using path integral methods , of the distribution of the area under a brownian excursion and a brownian meander .",
    "these results were originally derived by mathematicians@xcite using various probabilistic methods .",
    "the path integral method presented here , though perhaps not rigorous in the strict mathematical sense , does provide a simpler physical derivation .",
    "thus the results of this section are interesting by themselves and can be read independently of the rest of the paper that discusses the fluctuating interfaces .",

    "we are interested in computing the probability distribution @xmath13 of the area @xmath57 under the excursion .",
    "the brownian excursion , as described above , is however a bit ill defined for a brownian walk in continuous space and time .",
    "for such a walk , it is well known that if the walker crosses zero once , it recrosses the zero infinitely many times immediately after the first crossing .",
    "thus , for a continuous space - time brownian motion , it is impossible to enforce the constraint @xmath50 and simultaneously forcing it to stay positive immediately after .",
    "there are two ways to go around this problem .",
    "the cleanest way to study an excursion is to consider a discrete time random walk moving on a discrete one dimensional lattice and then sample all configurations that start at the origin and come back to the origin for the first time after an even @xmath58 number of steps .",
    "such paths are called dyck paths@xcite .",

    "let us list a few .",
    "\\(i ) in the steady state of the one dimensional ew or the kpz equation , the width of the surface height defined as @xmath471}^2 , \\label{stw1}\\ ] ] was shown to have a scaling distribution , @xmath472 where the scaling function @xmath473 is nontrivial@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) for the @xmath41-dimensional kpz equation , the probability distribution of the spatially integrated height @xmath474 , i.e. , the area under the surface profile , was shown to have the following behavior at late times @xmath151@xcite @xmath475 , \\label{ldv1}\\ ] ] where @xmath476 is a large deviation function which has a gaussian peak near @xmath101 , but has highly non - gaussian and asymmetric tails for large @xmath477 .",
    "\\(iii ) more recently , it has been shown@xcite that the single site height distribution @xmath478 in the growing regime @xmath479 of the @xmath41-dimensional kpz equation scales as @xmath480 where the scaling function @xmath481 is identical ( upto a scale factor ) to the celebrated tracy - widom distribution for the largest eigenvalue of a random matrix drawn from the gaussian unitary ensemble@xcite .",
    "note that in the stationary regime @xmath406 , this single site height distribution becomes a simple gaussian .",
    "however , as demonstrated in this paper , the global maximum of all these heights in a finite system of size @xmath2 has a nontrivial distribution in the stationary regime , characterized by the airy distribution function for the periodic boundary condition case .",
    "determining the corresponding scaling function in the kpz equation in a finite system with free boundary conditions remains an open problem .    in this paper",
    "we have analytically studied the distribution of the extreme height fluctuations in the stationary state of a @xmath41-dimensional interface .",
    "these height fluctuations are strongly correlated in the stationary state .",
    "thus our work provides a rare example where one can calculate exactly the extreme value distribution of a set of strongly correlated random variables . in the context of interfaces ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that another type of extreme statistics has been studied recently@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors study the distribution of the maximum of the fourier modes of the height fluctuations .",
    "however , in this case the fourier modes are independent of each other and the analytical computation is simpler , though physically relevant .",
    "_ experimental consequences _",
    ": our work opens up an interesting experimental challenge to measure the airy ( or the @xmath8-airy ) distribution function in a physical system .",
    "many experimental systems are known to be well described by the @xmath41-dimensional ew equation ( [ ew1 ] ) .",
    "examples include , amongst others , the high - temperature step fluctuations in crystal surfaces@xcite and the displacements of nonmagnetic particles in dipolar chains at low magnetic field@xcite .",
    "in fact , in the former system , there have been beautiful recent measurements of a variety of interface properties such as various first - passage properties@xcite , which were studied before only theoretically@xcite .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to see if the mrh distribution can also be measured in these experimental systems .",
    "this would then be the first experimental measurement of the airy distribution function which has so far appeared only in mathematical problems .",
    "several new directions and interesting open questions emerge from this work .",
    "one of the challenges is to calculate the mrh distribution for interfaces in higher dimensions .",
    "for example , let us consider the @xmath482-dimensional ew equation , where the laplacian term in the ew equation is @xmath483-dimensional .",
    "this equation for @xmath484 describes several interesting systems , e.g. , a fluctuating random gaussian manifold and also the time evolution of the magnetization of a spin system within mean field theory ( for @xmath485 ) .",
    "it is simpler to continue to think in terms of interface heights growing over a @xmath483-dimensional substrate .",
    "the relative heights will again reach a stationary joint distribution function in the long time limit , @xmath486\\propto e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\int { ( \\nabla h)}^2 d\\vec r}\\ , \\delta\\left[\\int h(\\vec r ) d{\\vec r }   \\right ] .",
    "\\label{con1}\\ ] ] the calculation of the distribution of the maximal relative height @xmath1 , starting from the above joint distribution , is a theoretical challenge . for @xmath487",
    ", the surface will be rough in the stationary state and one expects that the mrh will scale as , @xmath488 where @xmath489 is the roughness exponent and @xmath2 is the linear size of the substrate .",
    "hence , the mrh distribution is expected to have the scaling form , @xmath490 where the scaling function @xmath491 will depend explicitly on the dimension @xmath483 . on the other hand , for @xmath484 ,",
    "the surface is smooth and @xmath492 even in the thermodynamic limit @xmath493 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 will approach a limiting distribution @xmath494 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it would be interesting to compute this limiting distribution for @xmath484 .",
    "this is nontrivial because the relative heights are still correlated ( the correlation function falls off only as a power law @xmath495 ) , even though the surface is smooth .",
    "the only simplification happens in the limit of @xmath496 , where the correlation function dampens exponentially and one would expect , using the theory of extreme value statistics of independent random variables as in sec .",
    "vi , a gumbel distribution for @xmath494 .",
    "in fact , this has recently been verified for the ew interface defined on a small world network@xcite . however , for finite @xmath497 , the problem is wide open .",
    "the path integral techniques used in this paper are suitable only in one dimension .",
    "entirely new techniques are required to deal with the problem in higher dimensions .",
    "developments of such techniques are more than welcome .",
