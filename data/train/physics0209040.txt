    "poisson s equation and schrdinger s equation are the central equations for atomistic simulations . in case force fields",
    "@xcite are used , poisson s equation handles the long range electrostatic interactions .",
    "if the forces are calculated quantum mechanically , electronic structure calculations have to be performed .",
    "selfconsistent electronic structure calculations require the solution of a system where schrdinger s equation is coupled with poisson s equation .",
    "multiscale approaches for the solution of these two central equations are widely used , since they are much more efficient for big system sizes than traditional approaches .",
    "the multigrid method has been used for the solution of poisson s equation in the context of classical molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and it has been used by various groups for electronic structure calculations .",
    "several flavors of multigrid for electronic structure calculations have been proposed : its direct solution by the full approximation scheme @xcite , the rayleigh quotient multigrid method @xcite and a scheme where the the solution of the linear system of equations arising from the preconditioning step is performed by multigrid @xcite .",
    "the linear system solved in the preconditioning steps is not schrdinger s equation , but poisson s equation .",
    "the reason for this is that it is too difficult to find coarse grained representations of the hamiltonian operator if nonlocal pseudopotentials are used and the deferred defect correction scheme @xcite justifies the replacement of the hamiltonian by the laplacian .",
    "thus , it turns out that in all cases it is poisson s equation that has to be solved using multigrid .",
    "another very promising multiscale approach to electronic structure calculations is the use of wavelets as basis sets @xcite . as with any large systematic basis set",
    "it is also in the wavelet context very important to use efficient preconditioning schemes .",
    "diagonal preconditioning @xcite is most widely used . however it would be desirable to have at our disposal more powerful preconditioning schemes . using multigrid ideas for preconditioning",
    "has already been proposed in the context of interpolating wavelets @xcite .",
    "our discussion of prolongation and restriction schemes based on wavelet theory will show that the class of schemes based on interpolating wavelets is not optimal .",
    "because of its central importance for atomistic simulations and because it is a prototype equation for the study of new methods we will from now on consider only poisson s equation @xmath0 the solution of the differential equation eq .  [ poisson ] can be written as an integral equation @xmath1 gravitational problems are based on exactly the same equations as the electrostatic problem , but we will use in this article the language of electrostatics , i.e. we will refer to @xmath2 as a charge density .",
    "the most efficient numerical approaches for the solution of electrostatic problems are based on eq  [ poisson ] rather than eq .",
    "[ inteq ] .",
    "however preconditioning steps found in these methods can be considered as approximate solutions of eq .",
    "[ inteq ] .",
    "the fact that the green s function @xmath3 is of long range makes the numerical solution of poisson s equation difficult , since it implies that a charge density at a point @xmath4 will have an non - negligible influence on the potential @xmath5 at a point @xmath6 far away . a naive implementation of eq .",
    "[ inteq ] would therefore have a quadratic scaling .",
    "it comes however to our help , that the potential arising from a charge distribution far away is slowly varying and does not depend on the details of the charge distribution .",
    "all efficient algorithms for solving electrostatic problems are therefore based on a hierarchical multiscale treatment . on the short length",
    "scales the rapid variations of the potential due to the exact charge distribution of close by sources of charge are treated , on the large length scales the slow variation due to some smoothed charge distribution of far sources is accounted for .",
    "since the number of degrees of freedom decreases rapidly with increasing length scales , one can obtain algorithms with linear or nearly linear scaling . in the following",
    ", we will briefly summarize how this hierarchical treatment is implemented in the standard algorithms    * fourier analysis : if the charge density is written in its fourier representation @xmath7 the different length scales that are in this case given by @xmath8 decouple entirely and the fourier representation of the potential is given by @xmath9 the fourier analysis of the real space charge density necessary to obtain its fourier components @xmath10 and the synthesis of the potential in real space from its fourier components given by eq .",
    "[ fourpot ] can be done with fast fourier methods at a cost of @xmath11 where n is the number of grid points .",
    "the solution of poisson s equation in a plane wave is thus a divide and conquer approach where the division is into the single fourier components .",
    "* multigrid methods ( mg ) : trying to solve poisson s equation by any relaxation or iterative method ( such as conjugate gradient ) on the fine grid on which one finally wants to have the solution leads to a number of iterations that increases strongly with the size of the grid .",
    "the reason for this is that on a grid with a given spacing @xmath12 one can efficiently treat fourier components with a wavelength @xmath13 that is comparable to the the grid spacing @xmath12 , but the longer wavelength fourier components converge very slowly .",
    "this increase in the number of iterations prevents a straightforward linear scaling solution of eq .",
    "[ poisson ] . in the multigrid method , pioneered by a. brandt  @xcite ,",
    "one is therefore introducing a hierarchy of grids with a grid spacing that is increasing by a factor of two on each hierarchic level .",
    "in contrast to the fourier method where the charge and the potential are directly decomposed into components characterized by a certain length scale , it is the residue that is passed from the fine grids to the coarse grids in the mg method .",
    "the residue corresponds to the charge that would give rise to a potential that is the difference between the exact potential and the approximate potential at the current stage of the iteration .",
    "the solution of partial differential equations in a wavelet basis is typically done by preconditioned iterative techniques  @xcite .",
    "the diagonal preconditioning approach , that is based on well established plane wave techniques , will be presented in the next section .",
    "the section after the next will introduce multigrid for poisson s equation in a wavelet basis . even though the fundamental similarities between wavelet and multigrid schemes have been recognized by many workers ( such as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) this sections contains to the best of our knowledge the first thorough discussion of how both methods can profit from each other .    within wavelet theory  @xcite one",
    "has two possible representations of a function @xmath14 , a scaling function representation @xmath15 and a wavelet representation . @xmath16",
    "in contrast to the scaling function representation , the wavelet representation is a hierarchic representation .",
    "the wavelet at the hierarchic level @xmath17 is related to the mother wavelet @xmath18 by @xmath19 the characteristic length scale of a wavelet at resolution level @xmath17 is therefore proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "a wavelet on a certain level @xmath17 is a linear combination of scaling functions at the higher resolution level @xmath21 @xmath22 scaling functions at adjacent resolution levels are related by a similar refinement relation @xmath23 and hence also any wavelet at a resolution level @xmath17 is a linear combination of the highest resolution scaling functions .",
    "the so - called fast wavelet transform allows us to transform back and forth between a scaling function and a wavelet representation .",
    "let us now introduce wavelet representations of the potential and the charge density @xmath24    different levels do not completely decouple , i.e the components on level @xmath17 , @xmath25 , of the exact overall solution do not satisfy the single level poisson equation @xmath26 within the chosen discretization scheme .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wavelets are not perfectly localized in fourier space , i.e. many frequencies are necessary to synthesize a wavelet .",
    "however the amplitude of all these frequencies is clearly peaked at a nonzero characteristic frequency for any wavelet with at least one vanishing moment . from the scaling property ( eq .  [ scalrel ] ) it follows , that the frequency at which the peak occurs changes by a factor of two on neighboring resolution grids .",
    "this suggest that the coupling between the different resolution levels is weak .    in the preceding paragraph we presented the mathematical framework only for the one - dimensional case .",
    "the generalization to the 3-dim case is straightforward by using tensor products  @xcite .",
    "also in the rest of the paper only the one - dimensional form of the mathematical formulas will presented for reasons of simplicity .",
    "it has to be stressed however that all the numerical results were obtained for the three - dimensional case and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "preconditioning requires finding a matrix with a simple structure that has eigenvalues and eigenvectors that are similar to the ones of the matrix in question  @xcite .",
    "the structure has to be simple in the sense that it allows us to calculate the inverse easily .",
    "the simplest and most widely used structure in this respect is the structure of a diagonal matrix .",
    "as will be shown a diagonal preconditioning matrix can be found in a wavelet basis set and preconditioned conjugate gradient type methods are then a possible method for the solution of poisson s equation expressed in differential form ( eq.[poisson ] ) .    as one adds successive levels of wavelets to the basis set the largest eigenvalue grows by a factor of 4 for each level .",
    "this can easily be understood from fourier analysis .",
    "as one increases the resolution by a factor of 2 ( i.e. increases the largest fourier vector @xmath27 by a factor of 2 ) the largest eigenvalue increases by a factor of 4 .",
    "this basic scaling property of the eigenvalue spectrum can easily be modeled by a diagonal matrix , where all the diagonal elements are all equal on one resolution level , but increase by a factor of 4 as one goes to a higher resolution level .",
    "it is of course clear that all the details of the true spectrum are not reproduced by this approximations .",
    "the true spectrum consists of a large number of moderately degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum of the approximate matrix consists of a few highly degenerate eigenvalues where each eigenvalue has all the scaling functions of one resolution level as its eigenfunctions .",
    "the true eigenfunctions are of course mixtures of scaling functions on different resolution levels , but if the wavelet family is well localized in fourier space the contributions from neighboring resolution levels are weak .",
    "the localization in fourier space increases with the number of vanishing moments  @xcite and therefore this diagonal preconditioning method works for instance much better for lifted interpolating wavelets  @xcite than for ordinary interpolating  @xcite wavelets  @xcite .",
    "another line of arguments , that shows the weakness of the diagonal preconditioning , is the following .",
    "the preconditioning matrix can also be considered to be the diagonal part of the matrix representing the laplacian  @xcite .",
    "since the diagonal elements increase by a factor of 4 on each higher resolution level , @xmath28 the spectrum of the matrix has again the correct scaling properties .",
    "[ factor4 ] involves both the wavelets @xmath18 and their duals @xmath29 since it was written down for the most general context of a petrov - galerkin approach in a biorthogonal basis . in a pure galerkin context or for",
    "orthogonal wavelet families the @xmath29 have to be replaced by the @xmath18 s . in the 3-dimensional case",
    "there are three different types of wavelets ( products of 2 scaling functions and 1 wavelet , products of 1 scaling function and 2 wavelets and products of 3 wavelets ) .",
    "each type of wavelet gives rise to a different diagonal element , but again all these diagonal elements differ by a factor of 4 on different resolution levels . because of the weak coupling between different resolution levels discussed above , we expect the matrix elements of the laplacian involving wavelets at two different resolutions levels to be small .",
    "the numerical examination of the matrix elements ( fig .  [ decay ] ) confirms this guess .",
    "it also shows that within one resolution level the amplitude of the matrix elements decays rapidly with respect to the distance of the two wavelets and is zero as soon as they do not any more overlap",
    ". nevertheless , some matrix elements coupling nearest neighbor wavelets are not much smaller than the diagonal elements .",
    "one also finds a few matrix elements between different resolution levels that are less than one order of magnitude smaller than the one within a single resolution level .",
    "( 5.,18 . )",
    "( -5.,-1.5 )    the fact that all off - diagonal matrix elements are neglected in current precondition schemes explains their relatively slow convergence .",
    "it amounts to finding an approximate greens function that is diagonal in a wavelet representation .",
    "this is obviously a rather poor approximation .",
    "let us nevertheless stress that this diagonal matrix obtained by inverting a diagonal approximation to the laplacian is a much more reasonable approximation for preconditioning purposes than the diagonal part of the greens function .",
    "the diagonal part of the greens function has actually completely different scaling properties .",
    "the elements increase by a factor of 2 as one goes to higher resolution levels instead of decreasing by a factor of 4 .",
    "the multigrid methods to be discussed later include also in an approximative way through gauss - seidel relaxations this off - diagonal coupling within each resolution block as well as the coupling between the different resolutions levels .    in the following we will present some numerical results for the solution of the 3-dimensional poisson equation in a wavelet basis using the diagonal preconditioning approach .",
    "all the methods presented in this paper will have the property that the convergence rate is independent of the grid size .",
    "we have chosen @xmath30 grids for all the numerical examples .",
    "the fact that the number of iterations necessary to reach a certain target accuracy is independent of the system size together with the fact that a single iteration involves a cost that is linear with respect to the number of grid points ensures that the poisson s equation can be solved with overall linear scaling .",
    "whereas we use here only simple equidistant grids , this linear scaling has already been demonstrated with highly adaptive grids in problems that involve many different length scales  @xcite .",
    "the preconditioning step using simply the diagonal is given by @xmath31 in analogy to eq .",
    "[ potrep],[rhorep ] , the @xmath32 s are the wavelet coefficients on the @xmath17-th resolution level of the residue @xmath33 in a wavelet representation . @xmath34 is the approximate solution at a certain iteration of the solution process .",
    "the preconditioned residue @xmath35 is then used to update the approximate potential @xmath36 . in the case of the preconditioned steepest descent method used here",
    "this update simply reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an appropriate step size . as discussed above the constant in eq .",
    "[ pwprec ] depends in the three dimensional case upon which type of wavelet is implied since it is the inverse of the laplace matrix element between two wavelets of this type .",
    "[ sd_pw ] shows numerical results for several wavelet families .",
    "the slow convergence of the interpolating wavelets is due to the fact that they have a non - vanishing average and therefore a non - vanishing zero fourier component  @xcite .",
    "hence they are all localized in fourier space at the origin instead of being localized around a non - zero frequency .",
    "this deficiency can be eliminated by lifting .",
    "the fourier power spectrum of the lifted wavelets tends to zero at the origin with zero slope for the family with two vanishing moments considered here .",
    "lifting the wavelet twice leads to 4 vanishing moments and a even better localization in fourier space .",
    "the improvement in the convergence rate is however only marginal .",
    "the higher 8-th order lifted interpolating wavelet is smoother than its 6-th order counterpart and hence better localized in the high frequency part .",
    "this also leads to a slightly faster convergence .",
    "( -7.,-1.5 )    ( 1.,-1.5 )    combining the diagonal preconditioning ( eq .  [ pwprec ] ) with a fgmres convergence accelerator  @xcite instead of using it within a steepest descent minimization gives a significantly faster convergence .",
    "the number of iterations can nearly be cut into half as shown in fig  [ sd_pw ] .    up to now",
    "we have only considered the case where the elements of the matrix representing the laplacian were calculated within the same wavelet family that was used to analyze the residue by wavelet transformations to do the preconditioning step .",
    "more general schemes can however be implemented .",
    "it is not even necessary that the calculation of the laplacian matrix elements is done in a wavelet basis .",
    "one can instead use simple second order finite differences , which in the one - dimensional case are given by @xmath39 or some higher order finite differences for the calculation of the matrix elements .",
    "the scaling relation eq .",

    "( -5.,-1.5 )",
    "the aim of this part of the article is twofold .",
    "one aspect is how to speed up the convergence of the solution process for poisson s equation expressed in a wavelet basis set compared to the diagonal preconditioning approach .",
    "the other aspect is how to accelerate multigrid schemes by incorporating wavelet concepts .",
    "the part therefore begins with a brief review of the multigrid method .",
    "[ mgv ] schematically shows the algorithm of a standard multigrid v cycle  @xcite .",
    "even though the scheme is valid in any dimension , a two dimensional setting is suggested by the figure , since the data is represented as squares . since",
    "less data is available on the coarse grids , the squares holding the coarse grid data are increasingly smaller .",
    "it has to be stressed that the remarks of the end of the first part remain valid and that in particular all the numerical calculations are 3-dim calculations .",
    "the upper half of the figure shows the first part of the v cycle where one goes from the finest grid to the coarsest grid and the lower half the second part where one goes back to the finest grid .",
    "( -8.,-9.5 )    in the first part of the v cycle the potential on all hierarchic grids is improved by a standard red - black gauss - seidel relaxation denoted by gs .",
    "the gs relaxation reduces the error components of wavelengths @xmath40 that are comparable to the grid spacing @xmath12 very efficiently . in the 3-dimensional case we are considering here , the smoothing factor is .445 ( page 74 of ref  @xcite ) .",
    "since we use 2 gs relaxations roughly one quarter of the error around the wavelength @xmath12 survives the relaxations on each level . as a consequence the residue @xmath41 contains mainly longer wavelengths which then in turn are again efficiently eliminated by the gs relaxations on the coarser grids . nevertheless , the remaining quarter of the shorter wavelengths surviving the relaxations on the finer grid pollutes the residue on the coarser grid through aliasing effects .",
    "aliasing pollution means that even if the residue on the finer grid would contain only wavelengths around @xmath12 ( and in particular no wavelength around @xmath42 ) the restricted quantity would not be identically zero .    in the second part of the v cycle",
    "the solutions obtained by relaxation on the coarse grid are prolongated to the fine grids and added to the existing solutions on each level .",
    "aliasing pollution is again present in the prolongation procedure . due to the accumulated aliasing errors 2 gs relaxations are again done on each level before proceeding to the next finer level .    to a first approximation the different representations of @xmath43 at the top of fig .",
    "[ mgv ] represent fourier filtered versions of the real space data set @xmath43 on the finest grid .",
    "the large data set contains all the fourier components , while the smaller data sets contain only lower and lower frequency parts of @xmath43 . in the 1-dimensional case only the lower half of the spectrum is still dominating when going to the coarse grid , in the 3-dimensional case it is only one eight of the spectrum . because of the various aliasing errors described above the fourier decomposition is however not perfect",
    "obviously it would be desirable to make this fourier decomposition as perfect as possible . in the absence of aliasing errors",
    ", the gs relaxations would not have to deal with any fourier components spilling over from higher or lower resolution grids .",
    "let us now postulate ideal restriction and prolongation operators and discuss their properties .",
    "as follows from the discussion above , they should provide for a dyadic decomposition of the fourier space .",
    "consequently the restriction operator would have to be a perfect low pass filter for the lower half of the spectrum ( in the 1-dim case , in the 3-dim case only 1/8 would survive ) .",
    "we will refer to this property in following as frequency separation property .",
    "the degree of perfectness can be quantified by the @xmath44 dependent function @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of grid points on resolution level @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath44 dependence enters through the requirement that the signal @xmath47 on the finest resolution level is a pure harmonic , @xmath48 the function @xmath49 for a perfect restriction operator is shown in fig  [ f_ideal ] .",
    "such ideal grid transfer operators have to satisfy a second property , that will be baptized the identity property .",
    "the prolongation operator has to bring back exactly onto the finer grid the long wavelength associated with the coarser grid .",
    "this can only be true if prolongation followed by a restriction gives the identity .",
    "a third desirable property would be that the coarse charge density represents as faithfully as possible the significant features of the original charge density .",
    "in particular the coarse charge density should have the same multipoles and most importantly the same monopole .",
    "the conservation of the monopole just means that the total charge is identical on all grid levels .",
    "this third property will be called the multipole conservation property in the following .",
    "( -4.5,-1.5 )    with the ideal grid transfer operators , the solution of poisson s equation would be a divide and conquer approach in fourier space and it could be done with a single v cycle with a moderate number of gs relaxations on each resolution level .",
    "in contrast to a solution in a plane wave basis the division would not be into single fourier components but into dyadic parts of the fourier spectrum .",
    "for the case of our postulated ideal grid transfer operators it also would not matter whether the gs relaxations are applied when going up or going down , only the total number of gs relaxations on each level would count .    to establish the relation between multigrid grid transfer operators and wavelet theory ,",
    "let us point out a formal similarity . for vanishing @xmath50 coefficients ,",
    "the wavelet analysis step is given by ( eq .",
    "26 of ref .",

    "a wavelet synthesis step for the @xmath52 coefficients is given by ( formula 27 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath53 and is formally identical to a prolongation operation .",
    "one can now for example easily see that the injection scheme for the restriction and linear interpolation for the prolongation part corresponds to a wavelet analysis and synthesis steps for 1st order interpolating wavelets",
    ". using the values of the filters @xmath54 and @xmath12 for interpolating wavelets we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 which is the standard injection and interpolation . as a consequence of the fact that it can be considered as a wavelet forward and backward transformation ,",
    "the combination of injection and interpolation satisfy the identity property of our ideal grid transfer operator pair , namely that applying a restriction onto a prolongation gives the identity .",
    "usually injection is replaced by the full weighting scheme , @xmath57 this scheme has the advantage that it conserves averages , i.e it satisfies the monopole part of the multipole conservation property of an ideal restriction operator . applying it to a charge density",
    "thus ensures that the total charge is the same on any grid level .",
    "trying to put the full weighting scheme into the wavelet theory framework gives a filter @xmath54 with nonzero values of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 this filter @xmath54 does not satisfy the orthogonality relations of wavelet theory ( formula 8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the @xmath12 filter corresponding to linear interpolation .",
    "hence a prolongation followed by a restriction does not give the identity .",
    "a pair of similar restriction and prolongation operators that conserve averages can however be derived from wavelet theory .",
    "instead of using interpolating wavelets we have to use lifted interpolating wavelets  @xcite . in this way",
    "we can obtain both properties , average conservation and the identity for a prolongation restriction sequence . using the filters derived in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath61 @xmath62    let us finally discuss the first property of our postulated ideal restriction operator , namely that it is a perfect low pass filter . obviously any finite length filter can only be an approximate perfect low pass filter .",
    "fig  [ fan ] shows the @xmath63 function for several grid transfer operators .",
    "one clearly sees that the full weighting operator is a poor low pass filter , the filter derived from second degree lifted wavelets is already better and the filters obtained from 10th degree daubechies wavelets and twofold lifted 6th order interpolating wavelets are best .",

    "in addition we found that this trick slightly reduces the number of iterations and the total cpu time .",
    "the overall behavior of all the different methods is however identical when the number of gs relaxation is constant on each grid level .",
    "our results demonstrate that halfway v cycles with the restriction and prolongation steps based on wavelet theory are the most efficient approach for the solution of the 3-dimensional poisson s equation .",
    "it is most efficient both for finite difference discretizations and for the case where scaling functions or wavelets are used as basis functions .",
    "we expect that the approach should also be the most efficient one in connection with finite elements .",
    "it is essential that the wavelet family used for the derivation of the restriction and prolongation schemes has at least one vanishing moment and conserves thus average quantities on the various grid levels .",
    "wavelet families with more vanishing moments do not lead an appreciable increase of the convergence rate compared to the case of one vanishing moment for low order discretizations of poisson s equation , but lead a modest further increase for high order discretizations . in the case where a wavelet family was used to discretize the laplace operator , it is best to use the same wavelet family to construct the grid transfer operators .",
    "in addition to increased efficiency of the proposed halfway v cycle in terms of the cpu time , it is also simpler than the standard v cycle .",
    "this makes not only programming easier , but also reduces the memory requirements .",
    "i was fortunate to have several discussion with achi brandt about this work .",
    "his great insight on multigrid methods , that he was willing to share with me , helped a lot to improve the manuscript .",
    "i thank him very much for his interest and advice .",
