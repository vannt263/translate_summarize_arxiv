    "a possible scenario that explains the magnetic field configuration of the sunspot penumbra is the so - called uncombed penumbral model ( solanki & montavon 1993 ) . in this model a horizontal flux tube that harbors the evershed flow is embedded in a more vertical magnetic field .",
    "a similar configuration has been obtained by heinemann et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who carried out 3d mhd simulations of the penumbra and found that penumbral filaments are produced by bubbles of weak and horinzontal magnetic field fully embedded in a stronger and more vertical one .",
    "they also find field free gaps connected to the deeper convection zone which appear as bright regions in the emergent intensity .",
    "one of the most critical observations that any penumbral model must reproduce , is the net circular polarization ( snchez almeida & lites 1992 ) .",
    "different realizations of the uncombed penumbra have successfully explained these observations ( solanki & montavon 1993 ; martnez pillet 2000 ; schlichenmaier et al .",
    "2002 ; mller et al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "however , spruit & scharmer ( 2006 ) have pointed out that the models of the uncombed penumbra published so far , do not consider the effects of the external field wrapping around the flux tube .",
    "the goal of this work is to remove this point of inconsistency .",
    "as it will be shown , a uncombed model that consistently considers the perturbation in the external field introduced by a cylindrical flux tube , is also able to explain the net circular polarization observed in the sunspot penumbra with surprising accuracy .",
    "our embedded flux tube model is adopted from borrero ( 2007 ) .",
    "this model considers a cylindrical flux tube that carries the evershed flow .",
    "the flux tube is located perpendicularly to the vertical @xmath0-axis and is embedded in an inclined potential magnetic field .",
    "this model prescribes the magnetic field configuration in the local reference frame ( lrf ) : @xmath1 ; see fig",
    ".  1 ) , being the flux tube s axis oriented along @xmath2 .",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are taken from eqs .",
    "( 33)-(34 ) in borrero ( 2007 ) .",
    "these equations take into account how the external field bends and surrounds the flux tube .",
    "although the model is three - dimensional , variations along the @xmath6-axis are neglected .",
    "the model is described by 6 parameters : @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( strength and inclination of the external magnetic field far away from the flux tube ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( radius and central position of the flux tube ) , and finally @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( component of the flux tube magnetic field along the flux tube s axis and magnitude of the evershed flow ) .",
    "figure 1 ( top panel ) illustrates the magnetic field lines in the plane perpendicular to the tube s axis .",
    "the velocity and magnetic field vectors enter the static momentum equation .",
    "this yields the density @xmath13 , and gas pressure @xmath14 , that ensure force balance ( see borrero 2007 for details ) .",
    "once gas pressure and density are known , the temperature @xmath15 is evaluated through the equation of state for ideal gases .",
    "a varying molecular weight is used to account for the partial ionization of the different atomic species .",
    "once all the relevant quantities are known in the lrf , @xmath16 , we project the magnetic field and velocity vectors on the observer s reference frame ( orf ) , @xmath17 .",
    "this is accomplished by a rotation of angle @xmath18 along the vertical @xmath0-axis .",
    "this rotation ensures that the resulting @xmath19-axis meets the line of symmetry of the sunspot . a second rotation of angle @xmath20 along @xmath21",
    "is finally needed to direct the resulting @xmath22 along the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "mathematically ,    @xmath23        where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding rotation matrices . in this manner",
    ", we can locate the flux tube at any azimuthal position @xmath18 within the sunspot , and to place the sunspot at any heliocentric angle , @xmath20 , on the solar disk .",
    "thus , we can determine the line - of - sight velocity @xmath26 , magnetic field strength @xmath27 ( calculated in any reference frame ) , inclination of the magnetic field with respect to the line - of - sight @xmath28 $ ] , and the angle of the magnetic field vector in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "an example of @xmath30 is presented in fig .  1 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "finally , our physical parameters are expressed as function of @xmath31 , but for our radiative transfer calculations we need to know them along the line - of - sight . to this end , we project the observer s line - of - sight onto the @xmath32 plane : @xmath33 . with this vector",
    "we can construct the parametric equation of the line - of - sight in the @xmath32 plane :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the uppermost intersection point of the ray - path with the @xmath32 plane .",
    "the slope - intercept form of the line - of - sight is :    @xmath36    note that , either at disk center ( @xmath37 ) or along to the line of symmetry of the sunspot ( @xmath38 ) , the ray - paths are given by @xmath39 . at any other position , the ray - paths enter the @xmath32 plane , forming an angle @xmath40 with the vertical direction .",
    "as expected , @xmath41 perpendicularly to the line of symmetry (  @xmath42 ) .",
    "an example of the projection of the line - of - sight onto the @xmath32 plane is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "after these geometrical considerations , we are now ready to solve the radiative transfer equation and obtain theoretical stokes profiles from our embedded flux tube model . we have employed three different numerical codes : sir ( ruz cobo & del toro iniesta 1992 ) , diamag ( grossmann - doerth 1994 ) and spinor ( frutiger 2000 ) and verified that the results are consistent among them .",
    "we first calculate the emerging polarization profiles for 128 rays that enter into the @xmath32 plane with different @xmath43 s ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we then compute the net circular polarization ( ncp ) as the wavelength integral of stokes @xmath44 .",
    "the total ncp is obtained as sum of the ncp produced by each individual ray - path ( see example in fig .  2 ;",
    "top panel ) .",
    "five sunspots at five different positions on the solar disk were observed using the tenerife infrared polarimeter ( tip ; martnez pillet et al .",
    "1999 ) at the vacuum tower telescope ( izaa observatory , spain ) , and the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ; elmore et al .",
    "1992 ) at the dunn solar telescope ( sacramento peak , usa ) . the full stokes vector of 15648.5   ( tip ) and 6302.5   ( asp ) were recorded . for each sunspot , radially averaged azimuthal variations of the ncp , @xmath45 , are computed . here",
    "@xmath18 runs counter - clockwise , with @xmath46 referring to the line of symmetry on the center side of the penumbra .",
    "the determination of the position of the line of symmetry from the observations is a difficult task and can only be done to an accuracy of about @xmath47 .",

    "we have computed the ncp that emerges from our flux tube model for different heliocentric angles @xmath20 .",
    "this is the so - called center - to - limb variation of the ncp .",
    "we have repeated this calculation for flux tubes located at the line of symmetry of the sunspot , on the center side ( @xmath46 ) and on the limb side ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the ncp was evaluated for the same spectral lines of our observations ( sect .  3 ) .",
    "results are presented in fig .  2 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the parameters used for the flux tube model are : @xmath49 gauss , @xmath50 , @xmath51 km s@xmath52 , @xmath53 km , @xmath54 km . these values are consistent with result from spectropolarimetric observations of the penumbral fine structure . in addition",
    ", we have used the hot umbral model by collados et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to represent the thermodynamic parameters of the atmosphere surrounding the flux tube .",
    "martnez pillet ( 2000 ) has presented the observed center - to - limb variation of the ncp in 6302.5   for a large number of sunspots .",
    "our predictions ( fig .  2 ; bottom panel ; blue lines ) agree very well with his findings .",
    "our theoretical @xmath55 curve for 6302.5 does not cross zero at @xmath56 $ ] , however .",
    "this is due to our model simplifications : flux tube is always perpendicular to the vertical @xmath57axis , and the external atmosphere does not harbor any flows .    for the near infrared neutral iron line at 15648.5 ",
    "we are not aware of any similar work to that of martnez pillet . however , our theoretical curve is in very good agreement with other theoretical predictions that use a simpler uncombed scenario ( see mller et al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "the reason is that , along the line of symmetry ( @xmath58 ) , ray - paths are not inclined on the @xmath32 plane regardless of the heliocentric angle ( eq .  3 ) .      in this section",
    "we compare the observed @xmath45 , for different sunspots at different heliocentric angles @xmath20 , with the theoretical predictions from the embedded flux tube model .",
    "this is done individually for each sunspot .",
    "theoretical curves have been obtained using the same model parameters as in sect .",
    "results are presented in figure 3 .",
    "it can be seen that our model is able to reproduce many features of the observed azimuthal variations of the ncp .",
    "this achievement is especially remarkable if we consider that all we have done is changing the spectral line and heliocentric angle ( model parameters were kept constant ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the fact that we can also predict the existence of secondary maxima / minima in the @xmath45 curves .",
    "this is clearly the case of fe i 15648.5   , where more simple uncombed models , predict only the existence of 2 maxima and 2 minima at all heliocentric angles .",
    "the improved agreement between observations and predictions is to be ascribed to our more realistic modeling of the external magnetic field bending and wrapping around the horizontal flux tube .",
    "this is a crucial ingredient for 15648.5   , where gradients in azimuthal angle of the magnetic field play a major role ( landolfi & landi deglinnocenti 1996 ; mller et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "an important detail is that , in our model , the evershed flow is channeled along the horizontal flux tube .",
    "this means that the line of sight velocity , @xmath59 , vanishes always perpendicularly to the line of symmetry ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "thus , gradients in @xmath60 do not exist there , yielding always zero net circular polarization . in agreement with mller ( 2001 ) , decreasing the magnitude of the evershed flow decreases the amount of ncp roughly linearly . in the absence of a complete parameter study ,",
    "this effect alone can not be used to rule out weaker horizontal flows , however .",
    "borrero ( 2007 ) expressed concerns about flux tubes with circular cross sections having very smooth variations in @xmath61 .",
    "he pointed out that those variations might be too small to generate enough ncp ( snchez almeida & lites 1992 ) .",
    "results presented in this work prove those concerns to be unfounded .",
    "we have employed the model of borrero ( 2007 ) to predict the behavior of the net circular polarization in the sunspot penumbra .",
    "this model finds the equilibrium configuration of a horizontal flux tube with circular cross section , that carries the evershed flow , and is embedded in a atmosphere with a potential magnetic field pointing towards a different direction .",
    "energy transfer is neglected and therefore we can not address how the penumbra is heated .",
    "this model consistently considers how the external magnetic field opens and bends in order to accommodate the horizontal flux tube .",
    "this generalizes the work of solanki & montavon ( 1993 ) , martnez pillet ( 2000 ) , mller et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 2006 ) and schlichenmaier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , by considering the 3d geometry of the problem .",
    "we have compared our predictions with the observed ncp in two neutral iron lines and in five different sunspots .",
    "the agreement between theory and observations is remarkable , improving previous determinations based on simpler realizations of the uncombed penumbral model .",
    "other models for the penumbral fine structure ( snchez almeida 2005 ; scharmer & spruit 2006 ) should also try to explain these observations . in the future , we will attempt to reproduce also the full polarization profiles of these spectral lines ( cf .",
