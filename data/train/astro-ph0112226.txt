    "i was asked by the organizers of the conference to present a review of processes occurring in the early universe , between the end of a cosmological inflationary period and the end of big bang nucleosynthesis . due to the multitude of possible processes and phenomena which may have occurred over such a long evolutionary interval , and",
    "the plethora of scientific work which exists on the subject , accomplishing such a task on a few pages is a difficult undertaking and bound to be done superficially .",
    "nevertheless , i realize that such a mini - review of reviews ( i.e. frequent citing of other review articles ) may be of some aide to scientists outside of the community and provide an initial starting point for further study .",
    "it is in this way i like the article to be understood .",
    "my apology goes to all scientists whose work has not been mentioned explicitly .",
    "the article is split into two parts .",
    "the first part ( sections 2 and 3 ) contains a very general account of the evolution of the early universe and the processes which must have occurred to create an `` acceptable '' universe . in the second part ( sections 4 - 9 )",
    "more emphasis is laid on some recent developments and advances in the field .",
    "note that the article does not consider cosmological phenomena due to the ( putative ) existence of extra spatial dimensions ( cf .",
    "david wands , these proceedings ) , as the study of such is still in it s infancy .     +",
    "the hot big bang model of the universe is subject to overwhelmingly strong support by cosmologists .",
    "this is mainly due to three cosmological observations : the recession of galaxies around the milky way according to hubble s law , the existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( hereafter ; cmbr ) with an almost flawless blackbody spectrum at temperature @xmath0k , and the successes of explaining observationally inferred light - element abundances in old , `` uncontaminated '' astrophysical environments by cosmological production during a big bang nucleosynthesis ( hereafter ; bbn ) epoch occurring at @xmath1kev .",
    "additional support to the hot big bang is lend due to our increasingly accurate understanding of how cosmic structure formed from initially small perturbations extant at recombination at @xmath2ev , as witnessed by fluctuations in the cmbr . when considering the hot big bang model in the sixties it was immediately realized that in it s very early stages the universe may have been extremely hot .",
    "the above table provides a summary of the possible physics , and the respective energy scale , the early universe may have been subject to in its early stages ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . also shown is the phenomenologically successful concept of inflation ( cf .",
    "andrew liddle , these proceedings ) , which may be followed by an epoch of preheating , and requires an epoch of reheating , in order to produce an `` acceptable '' ( our ) universe .",
    "it is termed `` concept '' rather than `` physics '' as it is currently not known , assuming inflation took place , at which energy scale it occurred , and in the context of which particle physics model .",
    "thus , of course , there is considerable room for speculation about the evolution of the early universe , in particular also , since particle physics is known in detail only up to the electroweak scale .",
    "nevertheless , note the breathtaking variety of `` experiments '' and methods which are , and will be , used to gain insight about the early universe .",
    "these include observations of cmbr anisotropies by balloon - borne experiments , such as boomerang and maxima , and upcoming satellite missions , i.e. map and planck ( cf .",
    "david langlois and anthony lasenby , these proceedings ) , observations of absorption and emission lines in gaseous nebulae , such as clouds along the line of sight towards a quasar ( quasar absorption line systems ) and compact blue galaxies ( cf .",
    "9 ) , lattice gauge simulations to find out about the order of the qcd phase transition ( which is still unknown ! ) , existing ( lep , tevatron ) and planned ( lhc ) particle accelerators which have the potential to discover the ubiquitous higgs particle and/or supersymmetry , as well as space - born gravitational wave interferometry ( lisa ) , which could detect gravitational waves right form the very early universe .",
    "an early evolutionary stage of the universe different from the present has the benefit of providing explanation of why exactly the universe is as observed today . in particular , properties of the universe , which theretofore could only be attributed to initial conditions , may be explained by physical processes which occurred during the hot big bang .",
    "the virtue of an early cosmic inflationary phase to free the universe from `` unwanted '' relics ( e.g. magnetic monopoles produced during a gut era ) as well as explaining present cosmic large - scale homogeneity and apparent close - to - flatness has been well established ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . after this process cosmic energy density of the universe",
    "is dominated by oscillations of the inflaton condensate ( or other bosonic fields coupled to the inflaton ) .",
    "these condensates have to ( essentially ) completely decay into particles which couple to the standard model particles , in order for energy density to be dominated by ordinary radiation first ( which ultimately becomes the cmbr ) , and dark matter later ( at @xmath3ev ) .",
    "moreover , it is believed that the radiation has to be well equilibrated by the onset of bbn ( @xmath4mev ) . on the other hand",
    ", there are good arguments , assuming the existence of supergravity and gravitinos , that the universe should have not reached temperatures as high as @xmath5gev ( cf .",
    "the process of inflaton decay may occur via individual inflaton - particle decay ( reheating ) , and may ( or may not ) be preceded by a preheating era . during preheating other bosonic ( or fermionic ) degrees of freedom coupled to the inflaton",
    "are efficiently excited via parametric resonance due to the coherence of the oscillating inflaton condensate ( cf .",
    "irrespective of the thermal history of the universe between the end of inflation and the end of the bbn freeze - out , there exist three minimum requirements on this evolutionary phase .",
    "an asymmetry between matter and antimatter has to be dynamically generated ( baryogenesis ) , the production of a component which becomes to dominate the energy density at late times and accounts for the right cosmic structure formation ( dark matter ) has to occur , and the cosmic conditions during bbn have to be such that light - element synthesis occurs in accord with observationally inferred light - element abundances .",
    "all three may ( or may not ) be accomplished by various possibilities and scenarios of which some are shown on the following page .    for recent reviews on baryogenesis",

    "@xcite , and on dark matter to ref .",
    "@xcite ( mostly supersymmetric dark matter ) .",

    "finally , magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "@xcite for review ) and gravitational waves ( cf .",
    "@xcite for review ) may also play a significant role in early universe cosmology .",
    "observable remnants of early cosmic evolution are generally due to deviations from equilibrium . a number of such processes , having been recently proposed in the literature , may be attributed to non - trivial `` particle '' behavior due to violation of adiabaticity of mode frequencies .",
    "consider a non - interacting , massive scalar field in the expanding universe  @xcite .",
    "the usual expansion of the field operator @xmath6 in fourier space @xmath7 leads to the equation of motion for the amplitudes @xmath8 where @xmath9 is cosmic scale factor , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are physical momentum and mass of the particle , respectively , and a dot indicates a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath12 .",
    "solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) may be found in a wkb perturbation scheme ( @xmath13 ) and are given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 particle mode frequencies , and @xmath16 slowly varying functions .",
    "these functions are given by @xmath17 for nonrelativistic particles ( @xmath18 , nr ) and @xmath19 for ultrarelativistic particles ( @xmath20 , ur ) , where @xmath21 is constant .",
    "the energy density per mode is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 may be interpreted as conserved particle occupation number given by @xmath24 ( nr ) and @xmath25 ( ur ) .",
    "the total energy density may be computed by @xmath26 and exhibits the well - known redshifting by @xmath27 for relativistic matter , and by @xmath28 for nonrelativistic matter , due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "however , this intuitive picture of particle behavior breaks down whenever the wkb condition @xmath29 is violated . in this case",
    ", particle occupation number is not conserved .",
    "this may occur , for example , during    0.1 in * preheating : * given the potential @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the inflaton field and @xmath32 a `` matter''field coupled to it , a @xmath32 effective mass @xmath33 arises . at the end of inflation , when @xmath31 oscillates around the minimum of the potential ( i.e. @xmath34 ) an effective , and time - dependent contribution to the squared @xmath32 mass of @xmath35 results  @xcite .",
    "depending on the coupling constant @xmath36 this effective mass may be appreciable since , for example at the end of chaotic inflation , @xmath37 ( and @xmath38 ) , where @xmath39 denotes the planck mass .",
    "the maximum violation of adiabaticity obtains when @xmath31 passes through zeros : @xmath40 which may be large , particularly when the resonance parameter @xmath41 is large . in this case parametric resonance phenomena occur which may be associated with efficient explosive @xmath32 particle production due to nonperturbative quantum effects , driven by the coherent oscillations of the inflaton condensate .    0.1 in",
    "* the rapid cosmic expansion during and at the end of inflation : * the hubble constant at the end of inflation may be extremely large , e.g. @xmath42 for chaotic inflation .",
    "this leads to violation of the wkb condition @xmath43 for all modes with @xmath44 , i.e. even for very massive particles .",
    "such particles may thus be created out of the vacuum due to the rapid expansion of the universe  @xcite , even when no explicit coupling to the inflaton exists .    0.1 in in the sec . 5 and 6",
    "some possible cosmological implications of these processes are summarized .",
    "here i discuss the physics of preheating in a model with potential as in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , and in the limit of small @xmath11 .",
    "this model is known to exhibit stochastic resonance  @xcite .",
    "though preheating may occur in other models via physically different instabilities , e.g. `` stable '' preheating in `` conformally invariant '' models with potential @xmath45  @xcite , or `` tachyonic '' preheating in hybrid inflationary models  @xcite , or other mechanism  @xcite , the basic conclusions and implications often remain the same . the nature of the instabilities for different parameter combinations of a particular model",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .     +      0.1 in stage i :",
    "right after the termination of inflation , the number of bosonic `` matter '' @xmath32 quanta coupled to the inflaton grows exponentially via parametric resonance @xmath46 driven by the coherent oscillations of the inflaton condensate .",
    "this may happen even for a @xmath32 field initially in its vacuum state . in",
    "the above expression @xmath47 is a numerical constant ( floquet index ) which depends on wave vector @xmath48 .",
    "usually , efficient conversion of inflaton energy into @xmath32-quanta obtains only in the broad resonance regime with resonance parameter @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "sec . 4 for notation ) , where the second equation assumes chaotic inflation .",
    "in this case , there exist many , broad bands in k - space of sufficiently unstable ( @xmath50 ) modes . due to phase space arguments most of the inflaton energy",
    "is `` dumped '' into modes with wavevectors around the largest , still unstable , wavevector , i.e. @xmath51 . the initial decay of the energy density in the inflaton condensate due to preheating is often much more efficient than that by perturbative inflaton decay ( i.e. reheating ) .",
    "the decay rate of the latter process is given by @xmath52 for decay of the inflaton into a fermion ( @xmath53 ) pair via the interaction @xmath54 .",
    "production of fermions via preheating has also been considered  @xcite , it is , nevertheless , comparatively inefficient as fermion production is subject to constraints from the pauli exclusion principle , whereas similar does not hold for bosons .    0.1 in stage ii :",
    "after only a number of inflaton oscillations the energy density in the produced @xmath32 quanta may become considerable .",
    "a second stage of preheating commences when the existence of @xmath32 quanta `` backreacts '' on the dynamics of the inflaton background  @xcite , inducing an effective inflaton mass @xmath55 by virtue of the interaction term in the potential eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) .",
    "this increases the inflaton oscillation frequency and decreases the value of the resonance parameter @xmath56 .",
    "after only a small number of oscillations @xmath57 , the resonance parameter becomes smaller than unity ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , and parametric resonance becomes inefficient .",
    "the existence of @xmath32 quanta also influences the inflaton background by @xmath32 quanta `` rescattering '' on the inflaton background , thereby creating @xmath31 quanta and destroying the coherence of the inflaton condensate .    0.1 in stage iii :",
    "after the end of the second stage , resonance has become inefficient in redistributing energy between the inflaton and the `` matter '' field . at this point ,",
    "the universe is described by a highly nonthermal distributions of bosons ( with energy mostly in infrared modes ) .",
    "these distributions thermalize subsequently partially via turbulent wave dynamics , as recently shown by direct numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in most models reheating , i.e. existence of a well - equilibrated particle distribution as well as the complete decay of the inflaton energy , is still not complete , and may often only be accomplished by the decay of bosons to fermions ( as in the standard theory of reheating ) .",
    "perturbations @xmath59 of the metric around the friedann - robertson - walker metric are sourced by perturbations @xmath60 in the matter fields @xmath61 as shown here via the einstein constraint equation in longitudinal gauge .",
    "thus , parametric amplification ( exponential growth ) could generically also occur for metric fluctuations when parametric amplification occurs in the `` matter '' sector .",
    "moreover , it has been stressed that resonance often occurs for the @xmath62 mode , which may correspond to cosmologically relevant scales ( e.g. the observed scales of the cmbr )  @xcite .",
    "it is well known , that inflation may offer an attractive explanation for the density ( metric ) fluctuations on cosmological scales .",
    "this raises the question , if an epoch of preheating may actually destroy this prediction for the metric perturbations produced during inflation ?",
    "the answer to this question is , in principle yes , though in practice it seems to occur only within a small subset of models  @xcite .",
    "this may happen , in particular , in the few cases when a potentially existing background field @xmath63 of the parametrically amplified @xmath64 is not damped during inflation ( cf .",
    "( [ metric ] ) ) metric fluctuation may only be generated to second order in @xmath64 ] ) , but may _ not _ when @xmath63 is the inflaton itself  @xcite(i.e .",
    "single - field preheating ) .",
    "a second question is if small - scale  metric fluctuations produced during preheating may induce the efficient formation of primordial black holes ? finding an answer to this question is technically involved as it requires full numerical simulations of the einstein equations  @xcite , and , again , model - dependent .",
    "thus , contrary conclusions ( attained by varying degrees of sophistication ) have been reached in the literature  @xcite .",
    "though the universe is , of course , not required to pass through an epoch of preheating , if it occurrs it may have several observable consequences .",
    "one obvious observation is that the universe may have been left for a very long time in a very non - equilibrium state between the end of inflation and the onset of an ordinary ( thermalized ) radiation dominated epoch . during this non - equilibrium phase the generation of dark matter but also baryogenesis",
    "may be accomplished even when radiation domination commences at temperatures much below the electroweak scale .",
    "baryogenesis may proceed via excitation of non - thermal ( baryon - number violating ) sphaleron transitions induced by the large number of produced infrared quanta  @xcite .",
    "if the universe then reheats to a temperature well below the electroweak scale the common problem ( in ordinary electroweak baryogenesis ) of subsequent wash - out of the generated baryon number right below the transition may be circumvented .",
    "baryogenesis may also occur in a different scenario , via the production of massive @xmath66gev gut bosons ( see below ) , and the subsequent inevitable baryon - number violating decay  @xcite .",
    "old attempts to employ such scenarios were problematic due to increasingly large cosmic temperatures required for production of gut bosons , and the possible concomitant overproduction of gravitinos and/or magnetic monopoles . with the aid of non - equilibrium processes during preheating particles of mass @xmath67 may be efficiently generated , even if cosmic energy density @xmath68 after inflation ( @xmath69 in chaotic inflation ) falls well below @xmath70 .",
    "this is possible since parametrically resonant production of particles may occur whenever @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "4 - preheating ) .",
    "moreover , even relics of mass close to the planck scale may be generated when quanta with effective mass @xmath72 ( due to the interaction term in eq .",
    "[ potential ] ) decay immediately after production  @xcite .",
    "if such particles are unstable , but long - lived , they may in fact be the primaries of the observed highest energy cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the exceedingly large fluctuations in bosonic fields @xmath32 coupled ( parametrically unstable ) to the inflaton , i.e. @xmath73 may induce non - thermal phase transitions which , in turn , may result in production of domain walls , strings , and monopoles ( e.g. at the gut scale )  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , as discussed above ( sec .",
    "5.2 ) production of primordial black holes and/or generation of metric fluctuations on cosmologically relevant scales may also result .",
    "many of these implications may be used to constrain the coupling of the inflaton to other matter fields .",
    "moduli are light scalar fields with weak coupling to other particles .",
    "as will be seen , they are not easily diluted during inflation ( in contrast to massive degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this poses a problem , as they may become to dominate cosmic energy density early on  @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if their masses are of the weak scale and they have planck - suppressed couplings to other particles , they may decay after bbn , thereby disrupting light - element yields in an unacceptable way ( cf .",
    "6.1.3 . ) .",
    "supersymmetric particle theory generically contains flat directions in the scalar potential , which may be associated with moduli fields of exactly those properties .",
    "consider the equation of motion for a classical massive , and non - interacting field @xmath74 eq .",
    "( [ classical ] ) allows for ( undamped ) solutions @xmath75 when @xmath76 is satisfied .",
    "as the hubble constant may be significant during inflation , i.e. @xmath77gev in the simplest single - field scenarios , even fields with comparatively large masses are not damped during inflation .",
    "this defeats one of the original successes of inflationary theory , in particular , the creation of a `` clean '' universe by dilution of initially present unwanted relics into oblivion .",
    "one may pose that @xmath78 initially , however , the problem reappears also at the quantum level .",
    "moduli quanta with @xmath79 are continuously produced during , and at the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "even if the initial state at the beginning of inflation was , for some unknown reason , in the @xmath32 vacuum state , quanta are reproduced due to the rapid expansion of the universe .",
    "this process is not unlike the generation of density perturbations from vacuum fluctuations in the inflaton field , believed to be responsible for cosmological structure formation at some later epoch .",
    "it may be shown  @xcite that the fractional contribution of generated @xmath32 quanta to the present critical density is appreciable @xmath80 unless the hubble constant during inflation @xmath81 is comparatively small , and/or the reheat temperature @xmath82 of the universe is low . in the above , @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote present contribution of radiation energy density to the critical density and present cmbr temperature , respectively .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) assumes redshifting of cosmic inflaton energy density after inflation , and before beginning of radiation domination at @xmath82 as @xmath85 ( e.g. for inflation with potential @xmath86 ) . resulting from potentials @xmath87 , the reheat temperature @xmath82 in eq .",

    "the problem exemplified by eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) may be somewhat alleviated when either bosonic fields are conformally coupled to gravity ( i.e. extra term of @xmath89 in the lagrangian , where @xmath90 is the ricci scalar ) , or when fermions are considered . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) should be multiplied by a factor @xmath91 .",
    "gravitinos are spin ( 3/2 ) particles predicted to exist in phenomenologically successful locally supersymmetric ( supergravity ) theories .",
    "their ( possible ) existence implies constraints on early universe evolution  @xcite . at low energy ,",
    "gravitino interactions are weak , suppressed by powers of @xmath39 . in gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking gravitino masses of @xmath92tev are strongly favored . unless they are the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , they decay into standard model particles and their supersymmetric partners ( i.e. @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a photon and @xmath36 is a gluon ) .",
    "this typically happens after the epoch of bbn , with half life @xmath96 .",
    "such decay results in destruction of the bbn synthesized deuterium , overproduction of @xmath97he , or even more drastic , overproduction of @xmath98li these constraints are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "+    since gravitinos may be recreated after inflation by collisions of particles in a hot plasma , one may impose an upper limit on the reheat temperature of the universe .",
    "this upper limit is approximately @xmath99gev ( @xcite and references therein ) , imposing stringent constraints on the thermal history of the early universe . if instead @xmath100kev and the gravitino is the lsp ( as typical in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ) a limit of @xmath101gev may be imposed from their maximum possible contribution to the present density .",
    "nevertheless , it has been recently realized that gravitino production even _ before _",
    "radiation domination via non - thermal processes may be very efficient , possibly ruling out whole classes of early universe scenarios .",
    "gravitinos may be created out of vacuum fluctuations due to the rapid expansion of the universe .",
    "more importantly , the spin ( 1/2 ) component of gravitinos ( which is associated with the goldstino ) could be produced immediately after inflation , due to rapid variation of it s effective mass ( with frequencies having contributions from different scales , i.e. the hubble constant , inflaton mass , and zero - temperature gravitino mass ) .",
    "this process is similar to the production of particles during a preheating era .",
    "however , due to the complexity of supersymmetric theory , it is far from straightforward to make predictions .",
    "it is thus not too surprising , that claims ( for @xmath86 inflation ) range from limits on @xmath82 of @xmath102gev  @xcite , @xmath103gev  @xcite , to statements  @xcite that a short , secondary ( thermal ) inflationary period is required .",
    "it has also been argued  @xcite that inflation with potential @xmath104 is likely ruled out altogether due to this gravitino constraint .",
    "however , the above claims have recently been challenged  @xcite .",
    "it seems not clear , if in this process of `` preheating '' indeed the spin ( 1/2 ) component of the gravitino is excited or rather , the supersymmetric partner of the inflaton particle .",
    "0.1 in all the above illustrates that ultimately a low energy scale(@xmath105 small ) inflation , and/or low cosmic reheating temperature may be required .",
    "alternatively , unwanted relics generated at the end of inflation may subsequently be diluted by a secondary epoch of thermal inflation .",

    "the fragmentation process leads to the formation of non - topological solitons  @xcite - b - balls ( carrying baryon number ) , or l - balls ( carrying lepton number ) . depending on the details of supersymmetry breaking , b - balls may be stable since their mass may be smaller than that of a collection of nucleons ( with individual mass @xmath114 and with the same baryon number @xmath115 ) , i.e. b - ball mass @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 for large @xmath115 contained in the soliton .",

    "the existence of q - balls in the spectrum of supersymmetric theory may have implications for the cosmological baryogenesis and dark matter problems .",
    "stable ( at zero - temperature ) b - balls may generate the baryon asymmetry by partial ( or complete ) evaporation in the early universe .",

    "when supersymmetric r - parity is conserved , evaporation of unstable b - balls in the early universe may generate an in principle calculable ratio between cosmic baryon number and lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) number ( e.g. neutralinos ) . if decay occurs sufficiently late @xmath122gev , no further reprocessing of these abundances result .",
    "since the expected ratio lsp / b is of order unity , such scenarios may accommodate a cosmic coincidence , in particular , that @xmath123 and @xmath124 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this fact is usually not addressed in other scenarios of baryogenesis .",
    "it has long been known that primordial black holes ( pbhs ) may form from radiation in the early universe when only moderate density fluctuations ( @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is density ) on the cosmological ( and time - dependent ) horizon scale exist  @xcite .",
    "( i.e. @xmath127 , where @xmath12 is cosmic time and @xmath128 is speed of light ) .",
    "this provides `` observational '' support for a relatively homogeneous early universe ( especially after inflation ) , since if pbhs would form early on , they may either easily dominate cosmic energy density of the universe at an too early stage , or be in conflict with observations due to observable effects of their evaporation . with the help of this argument , the primordial density spectrum ( as , for example , generated during inflation ) may be constrained from arguments pertaining to extremely small spatial scales  @xcite ( as compared to cmbr scales ) .",
    "the scales where constraints may be derived from pbh formation may even be further decreased when the possible evaporation of supersymmetric particles are considered  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", pbhs may still be a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "in particular , pbhs of approximate mass scale @xmath129 would form during the qcd epoch . due to a soft equation of state because of the color confinement transition , pbhs form more easily during this epoch than during other radiation dominated eras of the early universe  @xcite .",
    "this could provide explanation for the as yet unexplained findings of the macho and eros collaborations , that a fraction of the galactic milky way halo _ may _ be in form of compact @xmath130 objects  @xcite .",
    "finally , there has been progress in the computation of pbh mass functions in the early universe . in",
    "the early nineties discovered critical phenomena in general relativity may , in fact , be exploited to derive the masses of black holes  @xcite , i.e. @xmath131 , given initial data of overdensity @xmath132 and a calculated critical overdensity @xmath133 for the threshold of the pbh formation process . here",
    "@xmath48 is in principal calculable , typically being of the order of the horizon mass during the pbh formation process .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is one of the main pillars of the hot big bang model . there",
    "exist several excellent ( and recent ) reviews on the subject , either on the standard model  @xcite employing minimal assumptions ( see below ) , or on the many possible non - standard variants of bbn  @xcite , where one ( or several ) of these assumptions is relaxed .",
    "the reader is principally referred to these reviews , or the original literature . in",
    "what follows i will , nevertheless , summarize theory ( in the standard model ) and recent observational progress briefly .",
    "bbn leads to the production of the bulk of @xmath134he , ( probably ) all d , and good fractions of @xmath97he and @xmath135li observed in the universe at present .",
    "it is the earliest period of the early universe where `` some sort '' of precision statements may be made , by detailed comparison between observationally inferred and theoretical predicted primordial light - element abundances .",
    "bbn occurs as a freeze - out process from nuclear statistical equilibrium of elemental abundances , in particular , between the epoch of weak freeze - out @xmath136mev ( where interconversion between neutrons @xmath137 and protons @xmath138 is too slow to maintain equilibrium n / p - ratios ) and a subsequent epoch at @xmath139 , when cosmic densities and temperature have dropped sufficiently for nuclear reaction being essentially frozen out altogether .",
    "making detailed predictions for the resulting light - element abundances involves making a number of assumptions about cosmic conditions , and neutrino properties . in the standard model ,",
    "these are uniform baryon density , the existence of three , light , stable , and nondegenerate ( i.e. no significant asymmetry between neutrino- and anti - neutrino numbers ) active neutrino species , a clean  universe , i.e. no relic ( decaying ) particles , no pockets of antimatter , no defects or evaporating black holes , as well as the applicability of classical relativity and non - varying physical constants ( e.g. fine structure constant @xmath140 ) in the early universe . under these assumptions ,",
    "there is but one free remaining parameter , the cosmic baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath141 directly related to @xmath124 , which specifies the model .",
    "note that the large number of assumptions in this minimal model exemplifies the constraining power of bbn .",
    "nevertheless , full use of this may only be made when detailed calculation of non - standard bbn have been performed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]    theoretical predictions for the synthesized abundances in the standard model as a function of @xmath142 are shown . here",
    "the width of the bands indicate theoretical uncertainties ( @xmath143 confidence ) in these predictions , which , with the exceptance of the @xmath135li isotope , are negligible when compared to uncertainties in their observationally inferred values .",
    "the field of bbn has recently been revolutionized by the ability of making comparatively accurate abundance ratio determination of d / h within absorption line systems on the line - of - sight towards distant , high - redshift quasars .",
    "currently the `` cleanest '' system ( towards qso 1937 - 1009 ) shows abundance of d / h @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "this , together with two further claimed accurate determinations of @xmath145  @xcite , and @xmath146  @xcite , has been taken to derive the value of @xmath147 for the primordial d / h ratio . whereas initial determinations have been attempted mostly within lower column density ( @xmath148 ) lyman - limit systems , inferred d / h ratios within higher column density ( @xmath149 ) damped lyman-@xmath140 systems",
    "have recently also been put forward .",
    "these include d / h @xmath150  @xcite and d / h @xmath151  @xcite . inferred d / h ratios , when plotted against column density , are consistent with an unexpected trend of decreasing d / h - ratios with increasing @xmath152  @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that the subject of determinations and interpretations of d / h - ratios in lyman-@xmath140 absorbers has not completely settled as yet .",
    "comparatively accurate determinations of primordial @xmath134he and @xmath135li abundances may also be made . from a large sample of extragalactic hii - regions and compact blue galaxies a value of @xmath153 for the primordial helium mass fraction has been derived by one group  @xcite .",
    "this may be compared to the result of @xmath154 by another group , based on a similar sample  @xcite , as well as the result inferred by a careful analysis of one single hii region , @xmath155 by two of the pioneers of the field of abundance determinations in gaseous nebulae  @xcite .",
    "the spread in results , together with theoretical estimates of the possible systematic uncertainties in the procedure of observational primordial @xmath134he determinations  @xcite , illustrate that the quoted error bars of all groups represent most certainly a significant underestimate of the true intrinsic errors of the method .",
    "note that , within a standard bbn model , a large @xmath156 abundance ( as given above ) is consistent with the inferred `` average '' d / h @xmath157 ratio , whereas a small one is not .",
    "this fact sometimes seduces cosmologists to `` prefer '' the large @xmath158 value . concerning the @xmath135li isotope , abundance determinations",
    "may be made in halo stars belonging to the spite plateau , known to have constant @xmath135li / h ratios in different stars , with a value believed to be intimately connected to the primordial @xmath135li / h abundance .",
    "two recent results are given by @xmath159  @xcite and @xmath160  @xcite . here",
    "the latter group claims to observe , for the first time , a contribution of @xmath135li in the atmospheres of these stars due to synthesis of @xmath135li via galactic cosmic ray induced spallation processes .",
    "nevertheless , both quoted values are inconsistent within the standard model with a d / h - ratio of @xmath161 ( which predicts @xmath135li / h @xmath162 cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this fact holds true even when theoretical uncertainties in the predicted @xmath135li / h ratio are accounted for .",
    "it seems thus that stellar @xmath135li depletion , reducing the primordial @xmath135li abundance in stars on the spite plateau by a factor @xmath163 , is required .",
    "( alternatively , it may be that most d / h determinations represent an underestimate of the true primordial d / h abundance ) .    in conclusion",
    ", though there may exist certain mismatches between observationally inferred and theoretically predicted primordial abundances within the standard bbn , these are probably accounted for by still appreciable systematic uncertainties in individual primordial abundance determinations .",
    "there exists therefore currently no strong motivation to move to non - standard models . given a value of d / h @xmath164",
    ", one may derive for the fractional contribution of baryons to the critical density @xmath165  @xcite , where @xmath166 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath167 .",
    "this value is probably also consistent with recent determinations of @xmath168 from the cmbr  @xcite . on the other hand , earlier quoted values of @xmath169 from observations of cmbr anisotropies  @xcite as large as @xmath170",
    "may simply not be accommodated within a standard bbn model .",
    "in conclusion , let me just make a short remark .",
    "early universe cosmology in the eighties discovered the virtues of a ( hubble ) damping term in the cosmological equation of motion for bosonic fields .",
    "this discovery led to the invention of inflation . in the nineties the virtues ( and problems ) of terms leading to instabilities in the equation of motion for bosonic fields in the universe were discovered .",
    "this revelation led to the possibility of cosmological preheating and formation of q - balls .",
    "inspection of the remaining terms in the equations of motion for a bosonic field in the universe may give , the educated reader , an outlook on possible developments in the first decade of this millennium .",
    "the author thanks the organizers of the conference for invitation and financial support , and the opportunity to visit south africa .",
    "i am also grateful to my girlfriend nanci , who `` forced '' me to be a responsible scientist and write this article .",
