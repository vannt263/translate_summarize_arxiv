    "it should be kept in mind that we have used the same single age , single metallicity population template for the whole map , and that therefore the maps for the intensities and equivalent widths of all the stellar absorption lines are proportional .",
    "this is obviously an oversimplification , as we know there will be variations in stellar populations throughout the field of view , but a thorough analysis of the stellar populations is beyond the scope of this paper , and these maps are intended only to be a tracer of the global stellar mass content of the galaxy .",
    "notice that we have obtained a map normalized ( according to the template ) to the nad line absorptions , which are the strongest ones in the wavelength range studied .",
    "this nad map is therefore free from interstellar contamination .",

    "the iso - levels of the ew in the innermost region are elongated with a p.a . very close to the 111@xmath24 quoted by  @xcite for the inner bar .",
    "the extent of the bar does also roughly agree with the 9 arcsec proposed by  @xcite .",
    "although this is not completely surprising ( as the equivalent width is expected to be somewhat less affected by dust than continuum or broadband maps ) , it clearly shows that the ew is a good tracer of the old population responsible for the absorption features .",
    "the two well known infrared knots k1 and",
    "k2  @xcite do not show up in the ew map and in fact correspond to minima on it * ( see figure  [ figure : ewsb3na])*. these knots are known to be regions of powerful recent star formation  @xcite and are therefore very bright because of the contribution of young stars , but not necessarily rich in old stars responsible for the absorption features contributing to the ew .",
    "although the spectra are smeared by poor angular resolution , we have been able to detect , for the first time , the ( otherwise hidden ) inner bar through the study of absorption spectral features characteristic of old stars .",
    "we would like to point out that , the @xmath25 band image shows very little hint of the spiral arms  @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that the mass distribution is quite axisymmetric at radii larger than @xmath26 .",
    "departures from circular motion are better addressed through residual velocity analysis .",
    "we therefore start by deriving a pure rotation model by fitting tilted rings to the observed velocity field  @xcite .",
    "this is a standard procedure for which the galaxy is divided into concentric elliptical annuli where each annulus is characterized by the inclination angle ( @xmath27 ) , the position angle of the major axis ( p.a . ) , the rotational velocity ( @xmath28 ) , the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( @xmath29 ) and the coordinates of the centre of each annulus ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these parameters are fitted following a least squares algorithm .",

    "this position matches , within the resolution limits , the position of the brightest spot in the hst image .",
    "we fix the inclination to a value of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the systemic velocity is calculated as the average value of the outermost rings .",
    "we obtain a value of 1567 @xmath12 7 @xmath13 . with these values",
    "fixed , we perform a fit leaving the p.a . and the rotational velocity of each ring as free parameters .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ figure : rcgas ] .",
    "the error bars in the rotation curves of figures  [ figure : rcgas ] and  [ figure : vel_stellar ] b ) are calculated from the difference in the rotation curves calculated for the approaching and receding sides of the galaxy and the error in the velocity determination , which have been added quadratically .",
    "the rotation curve obtained shows a very similar behaviour to previous observations @xcite .",
    "our values are in fact somewhat lower than those reported by  @xcite , but in good agreement with co observations by  @xcite .",
    "although , as usual , the inner region provides the most uncertain determination of the rotation curve , we have checked that rotations curves calculated for the maps at the two available resolutions ( sb2 and sb3 fibre bundles ) give an excellent agreement for the values of the rotational velocity in the overlapping regions .",
    "resolution effects will therefore not be too relevant in the shape of the inner rotation curve .",
    "the rotation curve shows a very steep rise in the inner 3@xmath7 , reaching values of 135 @xmath13 .",
    "the velocity reaches a maximum of about 160 @xmath13 at 6@xmath7 ( 470 pc ) and then declines smoothly to a value of 130 @xmath13 in the outermost ring at 12@xmath7 ( @xmath10 1 kpc ) .    to investigate the non - circular motions in the galaxy disc we compute the residual velocity map",
    "we would like to minimize the effect of non - circular motions being absorbed in the rotational model .",
    "we use for this purpose a rotational model with a fixed p.a .",
    "(= @xmath33 , which is the average of the p.a .",
    "values corresponding to the outermost rings ) . in this way ,",
    "most of the information on non - axisymmetric components is kept in the residual velocity .",
    "of course , deviations from circular rotation that take place along or near the major axis in a symmetric way ( on both the approaching and the receding sides ) will most probably be absorbed in the rotation curve shape .",
    "there is little hope of disentangling the non - circular and circular components along the major axis , and therefore we adopt this as the best possible solution .",
    "the calculated axisymmetric rotational model is displayed in figure  [ figure : kin ] ( c ) .",
    "subtracting this model from the observed velocity field , we obtain the residual velocity map for ngc 4321 which is shown in figure  [ figure : kin ] ( d ) .",
    "three regions can be clearly identified in the residual velocity map : ( i ) a blue - shifted nuclear region that shows blue residuals of about @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "we would like to point out that although the rotation curve is quite uncertain in the innermost region , the existence of these blue residuals in the nuclear region does mostly depend on the position of the kinematic centre and on the systemic velocity , which are both pretty well constrained by the observations .",
    "this fact suggests the existence of an outflow in this region .",
    "( ii ) a second region , further out up to radii of about 6@xmath7 , that shows a clear signature of influence of the nuclear bar ( whose position angle and size are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : kin ] ( d ) by the red line ) .",
    "the map shows residuals of nearly 50 @xmath13 on the west side and of @xmath34 @xmath13 on the east side .",
    "these are the zones where orbits tend to align with the bar potential .",
    "the symmetric shape of this region above and below the bar is quite remarkable .",
    "( iii ) at larger radii ( r @xmath36 ) the residual map shows clear signatures of the presence of the spiral arms with values of 30 @xmath13 for the northern arm and @xmath34 @xmath13 for the southern arm .",
    "the northern arm is more clearly depicted than the southern one .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure : resco_robdust ] ( a ) , the residuals for the northern arm nicely match the position of the molecular gas from the co map by  @xcite . the southern arm is somewhat displaced from the position where the highest residuals are found .",
    "the residual velocities along the arms seem to vanish as they approach the major axis , although , as we have mentioned before , it is very likely that a large fraction of the non - circular motions has been absorbed in the shape of the rotation curve .",
    "the latter two of the three regions have already been identified by  @xcite . in section  [ section : sym ]",
    "we perform a fourier analysis of the ionized gas kinematics to study the relationship of these regions with the gravitational potential .",
    "it is worth noting that the highest h@xmath4 intensity spots take place in regions of low residual velocities  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , in the case of ngc 4321 , the h@xmath4 ring of star formation actually lies in the transition region between the bar and arm regions ( with a radius of about 6@xmath7 ) with very low residual velocities .",
    "it is indeed very likely that both facts ( high h@xmath4 intensity and low residual velocities ) are closely related and star formation takes place in a _ kinematically quiet _ region",
    ".    a careful look at these residuals also reveals that the highest velocity gradients ( which trace shocked gas regions ) take place at the inner rim of the spiral arms and around the nucleus of the galaxy ( at its far side ) .",
    "this is better illustrated if we calculate the gradient of the residual velocity field .",
    "we have used the roberts  @xcite operator to compute the 2-d spatial gradient measurement on the residual velocity field .",
    "the residual velocity gradient contours are shown on top of an unsharp - masked hst image of ngc 4321 in figure  [ figure : resco_robdust ] ( b ) .",
    "it is quite impressive how the shocked gas traced by the high gradient matches very well the location of the dust lanes along the inner rim of the arms ( particularly for the northern arm ) .",
    "this indicates that the spiral arms are very probably formed by hydrodynamic shocks originated by gas orbit crowding at a resonance of the bar potential ( as the mass distribution as traced by the nir light shows no relevant overdensities at these locations ) .",
    "this coincidence of the dust location with high velocity gradients was also found and studied in detail for ngc 1530 by  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear velocity gradient , although mixed with some bar - generated shocks , may also be understood in the context of the presence of an outflow in the nuclear region . if the approaching side of an outflow ( more likely to be detected than the receding one , located behind the galactic disc ) produces a region of shocked gas over the nuclear region , this would be seen in projection somewhat displaced along the minor axis on the far side of the disc .",
    "additional indications of an outflow can be found in the morphology of the emission line profiles of the innermost region spectra that show blue shoulders and blue wings , especially in the high excitation lines ( [ nii ] , [ sii ] ) . in other galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , these features are an evidence of streaming gas . finally , the existence of a nuclear outflow is also supported by the blue - shifted interstellar contamination of the na d absorption ( see fig .  [ figure : sp_gx](b ) ) , very common in superwind galaxies  @xcite .",
    "we would like to go one step further in the analysis of the residual velocity field of ngc 4321 .",
    "one of the most striking features of the residual velocity map is its great degree of symmetry .",
    "@xcite already noticed that the @xmath37-band image of the nuclear region of ngc 4321 presented a high degree of symmetry .",
    "they performed a decomposition of the symmetric and antisymmetric components of this image , finding that an impressive 95% of the flux is emitted in the symmetric component .",
    "if , as expected , the @xmath37-band image is a good tracer of the mass density and hence of the potential , it is reasonable also to expect a high degree of symmetry in the kinematical signature of such a potential .",
    "we have therefore performed the same kind of decomposition in our residual velocity field .",
    "the result of such a procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : simasim_fourmodes ] ( a ) , where the residual velocity map is shown in colours with regions of symmetry and antisymmetry dominance plotted on white and black contours respectively .",
    "the three distinctive regions mentioned in section  [ section : gaskin ] now stand out more clearly .",
    "the central region is the only one that shows a relevant symmetric dominance ( with blue - shifted velocities ) while the bar and arm influence zones are regions of antisymmetric dominance .",
    "the rest of the map does not show any definite symmetry .",
    "it is not surprising that most of the residuals belong to the antisymmetric component .",
    "as  @xcite showed , there is a clear @xmath1 component in the potential generated by the nuclear bar .",
    "@xcite , and later  @xcite in an analytical way , showed that a perturbation of harmonic number , @xmath38 , in the potential shall generate @xmath39 and @xmath40 signatures in the velocity field ( dominating inside and outside corotation respectively ) .",
    "the antisymmetric component is dominated by an harmonic @xmath41 mode , while the symmetric component is contributed by a combination of even modes ( mostly @xmath42 ) . to show this in a clearer way",
    ", we have also performed a fourier analysis of the residual velocity field .",
    "the residual velocity field is decomposed into its fourier components in rings of different radii .",
    "each ring is therefore characterized by the amplitude @xmath43 and phase @xmath44 of each fourier component @xmath38 .",
    "the results are shown for the first four modes in figure  [ figure : simasim_fourmodes ] ( b ) .",
    "the amplitude of modes @xmath45 is negligible at all radii .",
    "the three regions of definite symmetry coincide with the regions of high residuals already mentioned : @xmath42 dominance for the nuclear region , and @xmath41 for the bar ( with a very constant phase angle , and spiral arms ( with a phase angle varying with radius ) .",
    "the @xmath46 mode is second in importance in the bar and spiral arms regions .    in our case ,",
    "if the bar @xmath1 perturbation to the potential is responsible for the deviations from circular rotation , we expect , according to  @xcite a strong @xmath41 signature ( with a secondary @xmath46 ) in the residual velocity field ( as we are inside the corotation radius and @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is exactly what is observed in our data for ngc 4321 .",
    "although a spiral structure is also a m=2 distortion and would therefore produce m-1=1 and m+1=3 signatures in the velocity field , we strongly favour the bar scenario .",
    "the constancy of the phase angle of the m-1=1 in the innermost region ( see figure  [ figure : phase ] ) clearly indicates a perturbation with a constant pa , as one would expect from a bar .",
    "moreover , the nir photometry of ngc 4321 clearly shows the nuclear bar , but no trace of spiral arms in the mass distribution .",
    "the fourier analysis therefore shows clearly that the velocity residuals are not local perturbations but _ global _ modes ( due to the high degree of symmetry ) generated by the @xmath1 potential perturbation of the nuclear bar .",
    "the spiral arms are also generated by the bar potential .",
    "the generation of the spiral arms is most probably caused by shocks originated by gas orbit crowding at a resonance  ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate the stellar rotation curve from the stellar velocity map ( see fig .  [ figure : vel_stellar ] ( a ) ) using the same method employed for the ionized gas .",
    "we fix the position of the centre , inclination , p.a . and systemic velocity to the values used for the ionized gas , and leave the circular velocity as the only free parameter in the fit .",
    "[ figure : vel_stellar ] ( a ) may give the wrong impression of an offset between the kinematical and photometrical centers .",
    "this is due to an combination of facts , the most important being that the systemic velocity plotted in fig .  [ figure : vel_stellar ] ( a ) is the one calculated for the gas ( which is used in the rotation model ) .",
    "the systemic velocity computed from the stellar velocity field would give a slightly lower value , resulting in a iso - velocity contour closer to the photometrical center .",
    "we have chosen to keep the determination of the systemic velocity from the ionized gas ( with a much higher s / n ) despite this spurious effect .",
    "the resulting stellar rotation curve is shown in figure  [ figure : vel_stellar ] ( b ) .",
    "it rises more slowly in the innermost region but shows a very similar behaviour to the gaseous rotation curve .",
    "the values of the stellar rotational velocity are always smaller than the gaseous ones .",

    "@xcite refined the method by noting that a plot of @xmath63 vs @xmath64 provides a combined measurement of the pattern speed using several slits , which is insensitive to errors in the centre position and systemic velocity .    as commented above",
    ", the tw method has been applied to several gaseous components , such as @xmath0  @xcite or molecular gas  @xcite .",
    "however , it is arguable whether these components satisfy the continuity equation .",
    "stars , particularly old stars , on the contrary , are assumed to survive several cycles around the centre and thus , are expected to satisfy the continuity equation .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to use our stellar velocity field and the strength of a stellar absorption line ( as a tracer of the mass surface density ) to apply the tw method to the inner region of ngc 4321 .",
    "the integrals in eq .",
    "[ eq : tw ] are performed along 21 slits parallel to the major axis and centred on the galaxy centre .",
    "the slits are offset by 1@xmath7 . the resulting @xmath63 vs @xmath64 plot",
    "is shown in figure  [ figure : tw ] .",
    "the plot shows also a _ symmetrized _",
    "version by using an odd @xmath65 weighting function in the integrals .",
    "the @xmath66 vs @xmath67 plot shown in figure  [ figure : xyplot ] removes the possible degeneracies between different pattern speeds  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "both fits ( for the unweighted and symmetrized data ) provide very similar results with a slope value of @xmath2 = 160@xmath1270 @xmath48 .",
    "the quoted error contains the contribution from uncertainties in the p.a . as a cross - check",
    "we have also used the @xmath25 infrared image of ngc 4321 of  @xcite as the mass tracer for the old stars .",
    "the results in this case provide a somewhat higher value for @xmath2 although compatible with the previous one within the large error bars .",
    "this result is very different from the one associated to the single bar scenario ( @xmath51 70 @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , in spite of the numerical coincidence the agreement with the fast mode of the nested bar scenario proposed by  @xcite , is not conclusive .",
    "a linear trend of the @xmath63 vs @xmath64 relationship like the one observed in figure  [ figure : tw ] is expected for the bar rotation pattern but it is not exclusive of it .",
    "in fact , the stellar rotation curve of the inner region of ngc 4321 is approximately described by a linear relationship of about 100@xmath1220 @xmath48 between 3 and 12 arcsecs .",
    "thus it would be not surprising if the convolution ( see eq.[1 ] ) of the corresponding solid - body like rotating velocity field with a bar of finite width will produce a @xmath63 vs @xmath64 linear trend with @xmath68 @xmath48 .",
    "a direct test repeating the complete procedure to apply the t - w method but now to a synthetic velocity field generated with the stellar rotation curve of figure  [ figure : vel_stellar ] yields a value @xmath69 @xmath48 .",
    "thus , @xmath70 and @xmath2 = 160@xmath1270 @xmath48 are compatible within errors .",
    "in fact , owing to the relative closeness between these two magnitudes ( if the two nested bars scenario is correct ) a robust determination of @xmath2 would need a strong diminution of the errors .",
    "this new determination of the pattern speed has obviously an impact on the location of the important resonances .",
    "a higher pattern speed moves most resonances to smaller radii .",
    "we have used the linear epyciclic approximation to make an estimation of the resonance location .",
    "there are two inner lindblad resonances located at radii of approximately 6 and 12 arcsec respectively .",
    "the ultra harmonic resonance ( @xmath71 ) is located at a radius of about 14 arcsec .",
    "the star forming ring seen in @xmath0 is located right inside the outer inner lindbald resonance and ultra harmonic resonance .",
    "whether this star forming ring is related to some of these resonances is indeed a possibility , but we can not be conclusive in this respect . in any case , these values must be considered very cautiously , as they depend critically on the shape of the rotation curve in its innermost region , and on the validity of the linear epyciclic approximation , which is probably a poor one in these regions .",
    "a few words of caution about the determination of the bar pattern speed must be said at this point .",
    "the original tw method eliminates some undesired integrals of spatial derivatives by using the fact that the integrals extend to infinity , where the density goes to zero .",
    "we obviously can not fulfil this requirement , as most observations having a limited field of view can not .",
    "it is usually assumed that if the intensity is low enough at the borders of the field of view , the method is still usable . as we have seen before",
    ", there seems to be evidence that in ngc 4321 there are several speed patterns that are relevant at different radii .",
    "if this is the case , integrating along a slit that runs over the two pattern speed regions may contaminate the results of the tw method ( for the inner , faster mode ) , even if we select the appropriate region along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "in fact , the tw method can be generalized for a continuously varying pattern speed with radius  @xcite although its application requires the solution of a volterra integral equation , which is much more complex and needs very high quality data over the whole region of interest .",
    "it would then be necessary to have high s / n data of the type presented here covering the whole disc of ngc 4321 to perform such an analysis and to solve this issue definitively .",
    "we have performed a fourier analysis of the residual velocity field of the ionized gas and determined the stellar bar pattern speed to study the departures from regular rotation and how they relate to the gravitational potential .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarized in the following points :    1 .",
    "the ionized gas kinematics presents , on top of the galactic rotation , three clearly distinctive regions : a ) a small nuclear region of blue - shifted velocities .",
    "b ) a bar - dominated region where the residuals originate from the gas orbits aligned with the bar major axis .",
    "c ) a region dominated by the streaming motion across two symmetric spiral arms .",
    "the analysis of the gas kinematical symmetries shows these three regions in a very clear way as regions of dominance of symmetry or antisymmetry , or , alternatively , of @xmath42 and @xmath41 ( secondary @xmath46 ) fourier modes .",
    "this is exactly what theory predicts if they are signatures of an @xmath1 perturbation of the potential .",
    "thus , the outstanding morphological and kinematic perturbations of the circumnuclear region of ngc 4321 present the required ( high ) degree of symmetry to be explained by the @xmath1 potential of a bar lying in this region .",
    "we have detected this ( otherwise hidden ) bar at optical wavelengths by means of the 2d distribution of the equivalent width of the stellar absorption lines corresponding to the old stellar population .",
    "this optical bar matches well the inner bar found in the near - infrared by knapen et al .",
    "we apply the tremaine ",
    "weinberg method to the stellar data to estimate the pattern speed of the inner bar .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath72 is very different from the value proposed in the simple bar scenario .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the pattern speed determination prevent the confirmation of  @xcite results based in the existence of two nested bars .",
    "the nuclear blue - shifted region is probably the signature of a nuclear outflow .",
    "this is supported by the blueward asymmetry of the emission line profiles and by the presence of a blue - shifted interstellar gas component in the na d absorption .",
    "finally , while star formation seems to take place in kinematically quiet regions , the dust location coincides with high velocity gradients .",
