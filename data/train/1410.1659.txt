    "the main topic of this paper is to investigate the dynamical behavior of a scalar variable @xmath0 subject to a transport mechanism of hyperbolic type coupled with a reaction process , driving the unknown @xmath0 toward one among two different competing stable states .",
    "restricting the attention to a one - dimensional environment and denoting by @xmath1 the flux of @xmath0 , standard balance of mass provides the relation @xmath2 dictating that the quantity @xmath0 diffuses with flux @xmath1 and grows / decays according to the choice of the function @xmath3 . the simplest structure for the reaction term @xmath3 giving raise to two competing stable states is referred to as a _ bistable form _ , meaning that @xmath3 is smooth and such that for some @xmath4 , @xmath5 equivalently , the function @xmath3 can be considered as the derivative of a double - well potential with wells centered at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "a typical reaction function satisfying which is often found in the literature is the cubic polynomial @xmath8 reaction functions of bistable type arise in many models of natural phenomena , such as kinetics of biomolecular reactions @xcite , nerve conduction @xcite , and electrothermal instability @xcite , among others .    to complete the model",

    "the standard approach is based on the use of fick s diffusion law , which consists in the equality @xmath9 , so that one ends up with the semilinear parabolic equation @xmath10 equation has appeared in many different contexts and the nomenclature is not uniform .",

    "thus , following the modification proposed by cattaneo @xcite ( see also maxwell @xcite ) for the heat equation , it is meaningful to couple with an equation stating that the flux @xmath1 relaxes toward @xmath11 in a time - scale @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 usually named _",

    "the initial conditions corresponding to read @xmath20 notice that equation formally reduces to in the singular limit @xmath21 .",
    "we also observe that if we include a diffusion coefficient @xmath22 , @xmath23 then last system can be reduced to the form of under the rescaling @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we can consider the case @xmath26 without loss of generality .",
    "system can be interpreted as a hyperbolic reaction - diffusion system .",
    "an intriguing issue is to compare the properties of the usual parabolic reaction - diffusion equation with the ones of its hyperbolic counterpart .",
    "this paper pertains to one of the main hallmarks of the allen  cahn equation : the presence of stable heterogeneous structures , describing the interaction between the two stable states .",
    "specifically , we examine traveling wave solutions to , i.e. special solutions of the form @xmath27 with asymptotic conditions @xmath28 with the aim of investigating their existence and stability from both an analytical and numerical point of view .    existence of traveling waves for systems of the form with monostable / logistic reaction terms has been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "the situation for the bistable case is less explored , even if it is more or less known that , under reasonable assumptions , there exist traveling fronts with a uniquely determined propagation speed .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in ",
    "[ sect : existence ] we give a self - contained proof of the following existence result , which provides also some properties crucial to the stability analysis .",

    "moreover ,    \\(a ) the function @xmath34 is monotone increasing ;    \\(b ) both components @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive and converge to their asymptotic states exponentially fast ; and ,    \\(c ) the speed @xmath36 depends continuously with respect to @xmath37 and converges to the speed of the ( parabolic ) allen  cahn equation as @xmath21 .    the smallness assumption on the relaxation parameter @xmath29 is not sharp and arises as a consequence of the specific choices of the natural variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which generates some obstruction in the course of the proof .",
    "a different choice of unknowns could provide a more general result allowing a weaker requirement on @xmath29 , and , specifically , @xmath38 .",
    "we observe , however , that condition is tantamount to the positivity of the damping coefficient in equation , a condition which is usually imposed in order to ensure that the solution is positive ( hyperbolic equations may have negative solutions even with positive initial conditions ; cf .",
    "the latter is an important feature for a density solution , for example .",
    "furthermore , although condition may seem as a pure mathematical assumption , it relates the relaxation time @xmath29 with the typical time scale @xmath39 associated to the reaction .    passing to the stability issue , as for evolution problems on the whole real line defined by autonomous partial differential equations , invariance with respect to translations determines that any traveling wave belongs to a manifold of solutions of the same type with dimension at least equal to one .",
    "thus , small perturbations of a given front are not expected to decay to the front itself , but to the manifold generated by the traveling wave and , at best , to a specific element of such set .",
    "such property , called _ orbital stability _",

    "this statement is the final outcome of some intermediate fundamental steps which are not detailed at this stage for the sake of simplicity of presentation .",
    "actually , theorem [ thm : nonlinstab ] is proved by following a well - estabilished approach based on linearization , spectral analysis , linear and nonlinear stability .",
    "all of these steps are developed in a complete way , altogether providing a sound rigorous basis to the stability of propagation fronts for the allen ",
    "cahn model with relaxation .",
    "at this point , we find it suitable to mention recent work by rottmann - matthes @xcite , who proves that spectral stability implies orbital stability of traveling waves for a large class of hyperbolic systems ( which includes the allen - cahn model with relaxation ) , and provides numerical evidence of spectral stability with spectral gap for the particular case of system .",
    "these numerical observations , however , do not constitute a proof of stability .",
    "our contribution is a self - contained study of the dynamics of traveling fronts for the particular model ( which warrants note because of its importance in the theory of hyperbolic diffusion ) , as well as a complete analysis of their stability .",
    "both the existence and the stability analyses are complemented with a numerical study confirming the theoretical results and providing additional relevant information on what should be expected beyond the boundaries of the proved statements . in the first part , we numerically determine the values of the propagation speeds and discuss their relation with the corresponding value in the case of the standard allen  cahn equation .",
    "interestingly enough , the model with relaxation exhibits in some regimes fronts that are faster with respect to their corresponding parabolic ones . at the end of the paper , we consider some numerical simulations relative to perturbations of the traveling front , restricting the attention to the case of standard and perturbed riemann problems .",
    "the outcome is a strong numerical evidence that the domain of attractivity of the wave is wider than what described by the stability result of theorem [ thm : nonlinstab ] ( see figure [ fig : random2tot ] , detailed description in section [ sect : numerics ] ) .",

    "<S> a modification of the parabolic allen  cahn equation , determined by the substitution of fick s diffusion law with a relaxation relation of cattaneo - maxwell type , is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis concentrates on traveling fronts connecting the two stable states of the model , investigating both the aspects of existence and stability . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution is the proof of the nonlinear stability of the wave , as a consequence of detailed spectral and linearized analyses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , numerical studies are performed in order to determine the propagation speed , to compare it to the speed for the parabolic case , and to explore the dynamics of large perturbations of the front . </S>"
