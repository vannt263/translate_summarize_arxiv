    "rx and is one of the best - known z cam - type dwarf novae ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which show standstills in addition to usual dwarf nova - type outbursts ( for a review of dwarf nova outbursts , see @xcite ) .",
    "although the exact origin of z cam - type phenomenon is not perfectly understood , it has been proposed that the changing mass - transfer rate ( @xmath1 ) is most responsible for the dwarf nova  standstill alternations :",
    "the standstill is a state of an enhanced ( @xmath1 ) , which thermally stabilizes the accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that a normal outburst below the critical surface density can trigger a standstill , which is maintained by an enhanced mass - transfer caused by irradiation from the brightened accretion disk and white dwarf .",
    "subsequent model calculations by @xcite and @xcite , however , did not well reproduce the observed properties of z cam - type stars .",
    "@xcite presented an observational test , and reported that some z cam stars were indeed brighter in standstill than the mean brightness in the outbursting phase , suggesting higher mass - transfer rates during standstills .",
    "more recently , @xcite claimed that the basic features are reproduced by correctly taking the heating of the disk by the tidal torque and the mass - transfer stream impact into account .",
    "@xcite also claimed that large variation of mass - transfer rates are not necessary to reproduce the z cam - type phenomenon .",
    "however , the resultant light curve by @xcite is different from the observation in some respects .",
    "@xcite argued that there is a striking departure from the theoretical prediction when a system enters a standstill .",
    "several types of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) show temporary reductions of @xmath1 , the best - known cases being vy scl - type stars and am her - type stars ( polars ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite tried to explain the z cam - type and vy scl - type phenomena in the same framework .",
    "however , observations suggest that there is a strong segregation of period distributions between z cam - type stars and vy scl - type stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , past extensive studies on representative z cam - type stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , together with more theoretical discussion by @xcite , have shown little evidence for vy scl - type strong temporary reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "the nature of z cam - type phenomenon is thus still controversial ; there still remain discrepancies between observations and theories . even if we assume changing @xmath1 as a cause of z cam - type phenomenon ,",
    "the exact origin of changing @xmath1 is still poorly understood , although star spots covering the l@xmath2 point @xcite would be a promising interpretation for the vy scl - type phenomena .",
    "rx and had been known as a relatively typical z cam - type dwarf nova , with outbursts - standstill alternations , until the discovery of an extremely deep fading ( also called deep quiescence by some authors ) in 1996 september .",
    "the deep fading lasted until 1997 january .",
    "the time - resolved observations were acquired on three nights between 1996 november 15 and 19 ( near the bottom of the fading ) , using a ccd camera ( thomson th  7882 , 576 @xmath3 384 pixels , on - chip 2 @xmath3 2 binning adopted ) attached to the cassegrain focus of the 60 cm reflector ( focal length=4.8 m ) at ouda station , kyoto university @xcite .",
    "an interference filter was used which had been designed to reproduce the johnson @xmath4 band .",
    "the exposure time was 60 s. the frames were first corrected for standard de - biasing and flat fielding , and were then processed by a microcomputer - based aperture photometry package developed by one of the authors ( tk ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the object was determined relative to gsc 2807.1483 ( @xmath4=11.86 , @xmath5=+1.05 ) , whose constancy during the run was confirmed using gsc 2803.948 . the magnitude of the comparison star is taken from @xcite .",
    "barycentric corrections to observed times were applied before the following analysis .",
    "we also obtained additional nightly snapshot photometry on 32 nights between 1996 september 10 and 1997 february 5 .",

    "the detector was a ci502ab ccd ( 512@xmath3512 pixels ) .",
    "the spectral coverage was 46007100  , and the wavelength resolution was 5.9 pix@xmath10 .",
    "the exposure started at bjd 2450484.9111 , and the exposure time was 600 s.    the reduction was done using the spectronebulagraph reduction system ( sngred ) developed mainly by m. yoshida at oao on iraf package .",
    "the averaged signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath11 ) per pixel at the continuum level was 22 .",
    "the spectrum was normalized by the continuum level .",
    "the overall light curve , which is drawn from the present ccd observations and the visual observations reported to vsnet international variable star network , is presented in figure [ fig : overall ] . for comparison with the @xmath4=15 mag reached during this extended low state , note that rx and is normally at @xmath4=14 in quiescence .",
    "such a fading strongly resembles faint ( or low ) states observed in vy scl - type novalike variables .",
    "the existence of such an extended , extremely faint state in a z cam - type star firmly established that a remarkable reduction of mass - transfer rates comparable to those of vy scl - type stars indeed occurs in a z cam - type star .",
    "the faint state lasted for @xmath0140 d.      in some vy scl - type stars , a total cessation of mass - transfer is suggested from the disappearance of flickering ( mv lyr : @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained time - resolved photometry of rx and during this extremely low state , in order to see whether or not the mass - transfer stopped .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows the nightly light curves .",
    "there indeed existed short - term irregular variations , which can be attributed to flickering . a period analysis with the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method",
    "@xcite or discrete fourier transform did not yield any coherent periodicity .",
    "the lack of coherent periodicity is also evident in figure [ fig : lc ] in that major flickerings ( flare - like brightenings ) occurred randomly .",
    "the variations were thus regarded as irregular .",
    "the variations were too irregular to be considered as oscillations of the white dwarf ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the persistence of flickering indicates that a substantial amount of mass - transfer in rx and was present , even during the extended deep minimum .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows the phase - averaged light curve , at the orbital period ( @xmath12=0.209893 d , @xcite ) .",
    "although there is an indication of double - humped orbital variation with an amplitude of @xmath00.1 mag , the lack of coherent signal in the period analysis more strongly suggests that the variation in the averaged light curve is spurious .",
    "we therefore put the upper limit of the amplitude of orbital modulations as 0.1 mag .",
    "one might expect a direct reflection effect from the hot white dwarf , if the accretion disk had disappeared or become optically very thin .",
    "the absence of such an effect also supports that a substantial amount of accretion disk remained even in the extended deep minimum of rx and .",
    "future optical spectroscopic observations on similar occasions will be able to test the presence of a normal cv disk .",
    "@xcite independently obtained far - uv spectra during the same deep fading with the hubble space telescope .",
    "@xcite applied a synthetic spectral fitting to the uv spectra , and concluded that the accretion disk contributes to 25 % of the far - uv light , corresponding to a mass - accretion rate of 10@xmath13 @xmath14@xmath15 yr@xmath10 .",
    "although their estimate of the accretion rate may have suffered from some degree of ambiguities resulting from a fit using an optically thick disk , the unmistakable signature of the remaining mass accretion ( close to the white dwarf ) in the far - uv wavelengths strengthens our finding of the remaining _ mass - transfer _ from the secondary .",
    "there was a gradually brightening trend since jd 2450439 ( 1996 december 21 ) .",
    "rx and brightened for the subsequent 14 nights at a mean rate of 0.037 mag d@xmath10 .",
    "such a slow brightening is commonly observed in the early recovery stage from deep , long , fadings of vy scl - type stars ( cf .",
    "general light curves : @xcite ; mv lyr : @xcite ) .",
    "rx and then started brighten quickly ( figure [ fig : brighten ] ) , attaining the maximum of @xmath4=11.4 on 1997 january 14 .",
    "the light curve of the brightening more or less resembles that of a dwarf nova - type outburst , but is different from ordinary outbursts of rx and in many respects : 1 ) the entire duration of the brightening ( outburst ) was @xmath040 d , with multiple peaks .",
    "the duration is several times longer than those of ordinary outbursts of rx and ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "2 ) the rise to the maximum was anomalously slow , accompanied by a short  stagnation \" period in the rising branch ( a temporary fading was particularly apparent near jd 2450460 = 1997 january 11 ) .",
    "the duration of the  outburst \" was similar to dwarf nova - like brightenings observed in a vy scl - type star , mv lyr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the slow rising branch also resembles those of long - period dwarf novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite interpreted this feature in gk per as a result of slow inside - out propagation of the thermal instability starting at the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "this condition is apparently achieved in long - period , low-@xmath1 dwarf novae , in which the critical surface density is more likely to be reached at the inner region @xcite .",
    "the same condition was likely to be achieved in the recovery process of rx and from the very low state , when the mass - transfer seems to have slowly recovered , as inferred from the slow rise from the deep minimum .    in the spectrum obtained on 1997 february 5 ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) , when rx and was declining from the the third peak after recover from the deep minimum and @xmath01 mag above the deep quiescence , emission lines of the balmer lines , h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 , and hei dominated .",
    "the equivalent widths , fwhm and fwzi are listed in table [ tab : emission ] .",
    "the errors of fwhm and fwzi are 40 and 100 km s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the instrumental width corresponds to 540 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the h@xmath17 equivalent width is @xmath18% larger than that in normal quiescence and on one day before an outburst measured by @xcite . while most dwarf novae , including rx and itself ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) are known to show reduced line strengths above quiescence , rx and in this stage showed relatively strong emission lines .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disk had an extra emission source , which can be naturally explained if the heating wave from the inner region had not reached the outer region of the accretion disk and the accumulated matter during the low quiescence was left from being accreted .",
    "the large values of fwhm and fwzi are also consistent with formation of these lines in the outer disk .",
    "the reason why such deep fadings of rx and had not been recognized before the 19961997 event was partly from the presence of a close @xmath4=14.3 mag companion , which may have been confused with rx and when the variable was exceptionally faint .",
    "this hypothesis is strengthed by the subsequent detections of ( shorter ) fading episodes occurring 1997 february to march and 2000 april to august . during both fadings , rx and",
    "was observed fainter than its  nominal \" quiescent magnitude of 14.0 .",
    "such fading episodes may have been identified as ",
    "intervals without outbursts \" in the past visual record .",
    "an examination of the data in vsolj ( variable star observers league in japan ) and afoev ( association franaise des observateurs detoiles variables ) databases since 1970 has revealed at least two distinct such instances in 1977 and 1986 .",
    "although the frequency and periodicity should be confirmed future observations , there seems to be a quasi - period of @xmath010 yrs , which is close to what is proposed for a vy scl - type star , mv lyr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the present extended fading episode strongly mimics the temporary fadings of vy scl - type stars .",
    "observations have suggested a number of similarities between the present phenomenon of rx and of vy scl - type fadings .",
    "the presence of a similar periodicity between rx and and mv lyr may further suggest a common underlying mechanism for producing temporary deep fadings , though the reason remains a mystery why there is no evidence of a similar phenomenon in other z cam - type stars .",
    "additional difference between the present fading of rx and and vy scl - type fadings can be seen in the initial part of the fading episode ( figure [ fig : overall ] ) .",
    "the disk instability model predicts that a system should undergo dwarf nova outbursts ( @xcite , @xcite ) in response to the temporary reduction of @xmath1 .",
    "this is what was indeed observed in rx and , in the early stage of the fading .",
    "vy scl - type systems , on the contrary , show little such evidence of dwarf nova - type outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite explained that such a departure of vy scl - type stars from the disk - instability model is caused by the irradiation from the hot white dwarf , which can suppress thermal instability .",
    "more recent discovery of unique short - period mini - outbursts in a vy scl - type star , v425 cas @xcite , can be regarded as another support to this explanation .",
    "the detection of supersoft x - rays from v751 cyg in low state ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the indirect evidence in bz cam @xcite also support this interpretation .",
    "the far - uv observation by @xcite during the deep fading yielded a white dwarf temperature of 34100@xmath211000 k , which does not significantly differ from those measured in other quiescent dwarf novae .",
    "this observation provides strong support for the interpretation that what phenomenologically distinguishes temporary fadings of rx and from vy scl - type fadings is the effect of heating from the white dwarf .",
    "we are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual and ccd estimates via vsnet .",
    "we are grateful to staffs of the vsolj and afoev for maintaining their databases publicly available .",
    "we are grateful to the staffs of okayama astrophysical observatory for helping with our observation .",
