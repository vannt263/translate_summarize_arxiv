    "one ubiquitous function is the partial trace ( ptr ) @xcite .",
    "the ptr function has a unique place , for instance , for the computation of reduced density matrices and related functions . in spite of the physical interpretation of the partial trace not being a trivial matter @xcite , it s mathematical and operational meaning is well established @xcite .",
    "besides , the ptr appears very frequently , for instance , in the context of correlation quantifiers ( mutual information @xcite , quantum entanglement @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , etc ) , in the generation of random density matrices @xcite , and in investigations regarding phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it is also a fundamental ingredient in the quantum marginal and extension problems @xcite , for the strong subadditivity property of von neumann entropy and related results @xcite , and in the theories of quantum measurement and decoherence @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to examine in details the partial trace function with special focus on its numerical calculation .",

    "<S> taking partial traces for computing reduced density matrices , or related functions , is a ubiquitous procedure in the quantum mechanics of composite systems . in this article , we present a thorough description of this function and analyze the number of elementary operations ( ops ) needed , under some possible alternative implementations , to compute it on a classical computer . as we notice , it is worthwhile doing some analytical developments in order to avoid making null multiplications and sums , what can considerably reduce the ops . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for a bipartite system @xmath0 with dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 and for @xmath3 , while a direct use of partial trace definition applied to @xmath4 requires @xmath5 ops , its optimized implementation entails @xmath6 ops . in the sequence , we regard the computation of partial traces for general multipartite systems and describe fortran code provided to implement it numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the calculation of reduced density matrices via bloch s parametrization with generalized gell mann s matrices . </S>"
