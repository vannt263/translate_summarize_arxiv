    "every maximal lattice - free set @xmath6 is a polyhedron with an integer point in the relative interior of each facet of @xmath6 ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ? * proposition  3.3 ) ) .",
    "the study of maximal lattice - free polyhedra is motivated by recent research in mixed - integer linear optimization .",
    "cutting planes for mixed - integer linear programs can be obtained from a simultaneous consideration of several rows of a simplex tableau ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "such cutting planes are deducible from lattice - free convex sets .",
    "furthermore , the strongest cutting planes are derived from maximal lattice - free polyhedra .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask for a characterization of maximal lattice - free polyhedra .",
    "since we aim at algorithmic applications , we restrict considerations to the class of maximal lattice - free rational polyhedra . in this paper",
    "we answer the following two questions :    a.   given the dimension @xmath7 and the precision of a maximal lattice - free rational polyhedron @xmath0 , how many different shapes are possible for @xmath0 ?",
    "b.   how do maximal lattice - free integral polyhedra in dimension three look like ?",
    "the answer to the first question is that @xmath0 can only have finitely many shapes ( a precise formulation will be given in the following section ) .",
    "in particular , we prove the following result .",
    "[ explicit.statement ] let @xmath8 denote the set of all lattice - free integral polyhedra @xmath9 such that @xmath0 is not properly contained in another lattice - free integral polyhedron .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath10 depending only on @xmath11 , and polyhedra @xmath12 such that for every @xmath13 one has @xmath14 for some unimodular matrix @xmath15 , integral vector @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ explicit.statement ] suggests that the constant @xmath10 grows rapidly in @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the proof does not imply any quick constructive procedure for enumeration of the polyhedra @xmath18 .",
    "having applications in mixed - integer cutting plane theory in mind , it is thus desirable to provide a precise classification for small dimensions .",
    "notice that finite termination of a cutting plane algorithm only requires cutting planes associated with lattice - free integral polyhedra as derived in theorem  [ explicit.statement ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the explicit description of @xmath8 in theorem [ explicit.statement ] for @xmath19 is folklore .",
    "however , already the class @xmath20 is rather complex .",
    "thus , the complete enumeration of @xmath8 for an arbitrary @xmath21 is challenging .",
    "we provide a classification of an important subclass of @xmath20 .",
    "theorem [ explicit.statement ] follows directly from theorem [ finiteness ] by setting @xmath22 .",
    "the classification of a subclass of @xmath20 is stated in theorem [ main.thm ] .",
    "let us first introduce the notation used in the formulations of our main results .",
    "( introduction of the standard notation is postponed to the end of this section . ) for the relevant background information in convex geometry , in particular with respect to polyhedra and lattices , we refer to the books @xcite .",
    "the intersection of finitely many closed halfspaces is said to be a _",

    "for @xmath31 we say `` lattice - free '' rather than `` @xmath28-free '' . in this paper , we restrict @xmath28 to be @xmath32 for some @xmath33 .",
    "our results are concerned with the interplay of the following three properties of polyhedra : integrality ( abbreviated with `` i '' ) , @xmath28-freeness ( abbreviated with `` f '' and an additional `` s '' in brackets to indicate the dependency on @xmath34 ) , and inclusion - maximality in a given class ( abbreviated with `` m '' ) . by @xmath35",
    "we denote the set of integral polyhedra belonging to @xmath23 , by @xmath36 the set of @xmath28-free polyhedra belonging to @xmath35 , and by @xmath37 the set of elements of @xmath36 which are maximal within @xmath36 with respect to inclusion .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the group of all affine transformations @xmath39 in @xmath1 with @xmath40 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath41 .",
    "henceforth , the transformations in @xmath38 are called _ @xmath28-preserving _ , while the transformations in @xmath42 are called _",
    "unimodular_. if a set @xmath0 can be mapped to a set @xmath43 by a @xmath28-preserving transformation we simply say that both sets are _",
    "the group @xmath38 has a natural action on @xmath35 .",
    "typically , we are interested in polyhedra in @xmath35 identified modulo @xmath38 , since this identification does not change affine properties of integral polyhedra relative to the lattice @xmath28 . in particular , two polyhedra @xmath44 which coincide up to an affine transformation in @xmath38",
    "contain the same number of lattice points in @xmath4 and @xmath28 on corresponding faces .",
    "let us assume that @xmath24 is a maximal lattice - free rational polyhedron with precision @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is an integral polyhedron and the maximality and lattice - freeness of @xmath0 with respect to the standard lattice @xmath4 transfers one - to - one into a maximality and @xmath28-freeness of @xmath3 with respect to the lattice @xmath45 .",
    "thus , instead of analyzing `` maximal lattice - free rational polyhedra ''  ( which correspond to cutting planes when rational data is assumed ) we can equivalently consider the more convenient set of `` maximal @xmath28-free integral polyhedra '' . indeed , from an analytical point of view , the latter set is easier to handle since results from the literature can be used which are stated in terms of integral polyhedra .",

    "second , if we fix some integer @xmath27 and consider the set of polytopes with vertices in @xmath61 , then there is only a finite number of maximal lattice - free polytopes in this set up to an affine transformation preserving @xmath4 .",
