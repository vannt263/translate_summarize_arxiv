    "the deficit of detected neutrinos coming from the sun compared with our expectations based on laboratory measurements , known as the solar neutrino problem , was one of the outstanding problems in basic physics for over thirty years .",
    "it appeared inescapable that either our understanding of the energy producing processes in the sun was seriously defective , or neutrinos , one of the fundamental particles in the standard model , had important properties which had not been measured .",
    "it was indeed argued by some that we needed to change our ideas on how energy was produced in fusion reactions inside the sun .",
    "others suggested that the problem arose due to peculiar characteristics of neutrinos such as vacuum or matter oscillations .",
    "it is useful to review the evolution of our understanding from the data collected by various solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the new analysis of the salt data collected by the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite will be described , together with the technique used to combine the results of many solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the energy in the sun is produced by nuclear reactions that transform hydrogen into helium . through the fusion reactions , four protons",
    "combine to form a helium nucleus containing two protons and two neutrons .",
    "the only reactions that allow this to happen are caused by weak interactions like nuclear beta decay .",
    "each time a neutron is formed , there must be an associated positron and electron neutrino produced .",
    "neutrinos can travel directly from the core of the sun to the earth in a about eight minutes and hence provide a direct way to study thermonuclear processes in the sun .",
    "the detailed predictions of the solar electron neutrino flux have been produced by john bahcall and his collaborators from the 1960 s until now .",
    "their calculations are refereed to as the standard solar model ( ssm ) . in this proceeding ,",
    "the bahcall - pinsonneault calculations  @xcite are compared to experimental results .",
    "it is known that neutrinos exist in different flavors corresponding to the three charged leptons : the electron , muon , and tau particles .",
    "if neutrinos have masses , flavor can mix and a neutrino emitted in a weak interaction is represented as a superposition of mass eigenstates . in the case of three flavors of neutrino , the mixing matrix @xmath0 is called the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) matrix  @xcite and @xmath1 . here",
    "the neutrino mass eigenstates are denoted by @xmath2 with @xmath3 , while the flavor eigenstates are labeled @xmath4 .",
    "the most general form of mixing for three families of neutrinos can be simplified so that only two neutrinos participate in the oscillations .",
    "hence , the survival probability for solar neutrinos propagating in time takes the approximate form @xmath5 the mixing angle is represented by @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the distance between the production point of @xmath8 and the point of detection of @xmath9 , e is the energy of the neutrino , and @xmath10 is the difference in the squares of the masses of the two states @xmath11 and @xmath2 which are mixing .",
    "the function @xmath12 is the usual kronecker delta .",
    "the numerical constant 1.27 is valid for @xmath7 in meters , @xmath13 in mev , and @xmath14 in ev@xmath15 .",
    "the energy of a neutrino depends on the type of nuclear reaction which produced it . by studying the evolution of the solar neutrinos as a function of @xmath7 , all the physics",
    "is embedded in one angle @xmath6 , one mass difference @xmath14 , and the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to the extraction of the three mnsp elements : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) is a 1,000 ton heavy - water @xmath19erenkov detector@xcite situated 2  km underground in inco s creighton mine in canada .",
    "another 7,000 tons of ultra - pure light water is used for support and shielding .",
    "the heavy water is in an acrylic vessel ( 12  m diameter and 5  cm thick ) viewed by 9,456 pmt mounted on a geodesic structure 18  m in diameter ; all contained within a polyurethane - coated barrel - shaped cavity ( 22  m diameter by 34  m high ) .",
    "the solar - neutrino detectors in operation prior to sno were mainly sensitive to the electron neutrino type ; while the use of heavy water by sno allows neutrinos to interact through charged - current ( cc ) , elastic - scattering ( es ) , or neutral - current ( nc ) interactions .",
    "the determination of these reaction rates is a critical measurement in determining if neutrinos oscillate in transit between the core of the sun and their observation on earth .    during the pure @xmath20 phase of the experiment ,",
    "the signal was determined with a statistical analysis based on the direction , @xmath21 , the position , @xmath22 , and the kinetic energy , @xmath23 , of the reconstructed events assuming the ssm energy spectrum shape  @xcite .",
    "the final selection criteria were @xmath24  mev and @xmath25  cm .",
    "the result of the extended maximum - likelihood fit yields  @xcite @xmath26 the excess of the nc flux over the cc and es fluxes implies neutrino flavor transformations .",
    "there is also a good agreement between the sno nc flux and the total @xmath27 flux of @xmath28 @xmath29 predicted by the ssm .",
    "a simple change of variables that resolves the data directly into electron and non - electron components  @xcite indicates clear evidence of solar neutrino flavor transformation at 5.3 standard deviations @xmath30    allowing a time variation of the total flux of solar neutrinos leads to day / night measurements by sno , which are sensitive to the neutrino type  @xcite @xmath31 by forcing no asymmetry in the @xmath32 rate , i.e. @xmath33 , the day / night asymmetry for the electron neutrino is  @xcite @xmath34 .",
    "sno published its first results of the salt phase  @xcite in coincidence with the phystat2003 conference .",
    "the measurements were made with dissolved @xmath35 in the heavy water to enhance the sensitivity and signature for neutral - current interactions .",
    "neutron capture on @xmath36 typically produces multiple @xmath37 rays while the cc and es reactions produce single electrons .",
    "the greater isotropy of the @xmath19erenkov light from neutron capture events relative to cc and es events allows good statistical separation of the event types .",
    "the degree of the @xmath19erenkov light isotropy is determined by the pattern of pmt hits .",
    "this separation allows a precise measurement of the nc flux to be made independent of assumptions about the cc and es energy spectra . to minimize the possibility of introducing biases",
    ", sno performed a blind analysis for the model independent determination of the total active @xmath27 solar neutrino . in this analysis",
    ", events are statistically separated into cc , nc , es , and external - source neutrons using an extended maximum - likelihood technique based on the distributions of isotropy , @xmath21 , and radius , r , within the detector . to take into account correlations between isotropy and energy , a 2d joint probability density function ( pdf ) is constructed .",
    "this analysis differs from the analyses of the pure @xmath20 data  @xcite since ( 1 ) correlations are explicitly incorporated in the signal extraction and ( 2 ) the spectral distributions of the es and cc events are not constrained to the @xmath27 shape , but are extracted from the data .",
    "@xmath19erenkov event backgrounds from @xmath38 decays are reduced with an effective electron kinetic energy threshold @xmath23 @xmath39 5.5  mev and a fiducial volume with radius @xmath25 cm .",
    "the extended maximum - likelihood analysis gives the following @xmath27 fluxes  @xcite @xmath40 the systematic uncertainties on the derived fluxes are shown in table  [ errors ] .",
    "these fluxes are in agreement with previous sno measurements and the ssm .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath27 flux measured with the cc and nc reactions then provides confirmation of solar neutrino oscillations @xmath41    .[errors]systematic uncertainties ( in % ) on fluxes for the spectral shape unconstrained analysis of the salt data set . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     when sno quotes @xmath42 , it refers to the integral flux from zero to the endpoint assuming an undistorted @xmath27 spectrum .",
    "it implies that the number of events attributed to cc interactions above @xmath43  mev is equal to the number of events that would be observed if the @xmath8 flux follows the @xmath27 spectral shape .",
    "the @xmath27 spectral shape aspect of this definition is only for normalization ; there is no assumption of any spectral shape when extracting the number of events during the salt phase .",
    "similar definitions apply for the nc and es fluxes .    for the comparison of the sno cc rate with the theoretical rates for a set of oscillation parameters , the @xmath44 flux is @xmath45 with the scale @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 where @xmath48 the factor @xmath49 allows the total @xmath27 solar neutrino flux to float from the ssm value , @xmath50 is the neutrino energy , @xmath51 is the survival probability",
    ", @xmath52 is the true recoil electron kinetic energy , and @xmath23 is the observed electron kinetic energy ; while @xmath53 is a gaussian energy response function for @xmath23 with @xmath54 it is a similar definition for the sno es flux , remembering to include the contribution from @xmath55 using the appropriate cross section and @xmath56 .",
    "there is no ambiguity in interpreting nc flux since it is equal to the total ssm flux .",
    "this section summarizes the constraints from solar neutrino data in a global analysis .",
    "the allowed region in the oscillation @xmath57 plane is obtained by comparing the measured rates to the calculated ssm solar neutrino rate .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath58 observables @xmath59 for @xmath60 with the associated set of experimental observations @xmath61 and theoretical predictions @xmath62 . in general , one wants to build a @xmath63 function which measures the differences @xmath64 in units of the total experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
