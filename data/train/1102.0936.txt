    "in the riemannian geometry influenced discourse on lorentzian geometry , the causal structure @xmath1 of a spacetime @xmath2 is viewed as a derivative construction which relies on the underlying differentiable structure of @xmath3 , with the causal relation @xmath4 between events on @xmath3 being obtained from the local lightcone structure provided by @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath1 is , however , itself rich with information about the spacetime geometry , and it has been the focus of several investigations over the years to endow it with a more primitive role in lorentzian geometry @xcite .",
    "we will concern ourselves in this work only with the causal structure of _ causal _ spacetimes , i.e. , those that harbour no closed causal curves .",
    "for such spacetimes @xmath1 is a partially ordered set , i.e. , @xmath4 is ( i ) _ acyclic _ : for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and ( ii ) _ transitive _ : for @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that the set of events @xmath3 in @xmath1 does not carry with it the attendant differentiable structure of its spacetime avatar .",
    "@xmath1 has no analog in riemannian geometry , and it is therefore of very general interest to understand the role it plays in lorentzian geometry @xcite .",
    "a set of results due to malament and hawking - mccarthy - king @xcite ( mhkm ) provides an important relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in spacetimes that are _ future and past distinguishing _ ( fpd ) .",
    "these are spacetimes in which the chronological ( time - like ) past and future sets are unique for every spacetime event . mhkm address the general question : what aspects of the spacetime geometry are left invariant under a causal structure preserving bijection between two spacetimes ?",
    "such a map is called a _",
    "causal bijection_.    a _ causal bijection _ @xmath12 is a bijection between the set of events @xmath13 and @xmath14 which , in addition , preserves the causal relations @xmath15 and @xmath16 : for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and for @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "malament s original results were restricted to chronological bijections , i.e. , those that preserve only the chronological relation , but as shown by levichev @xcite causal bijections , themselves imply chronological bijections .",
    "we can summarise these results as    * malament - hawking - king - mccarthy - levichev(mhkml ) * + if a causal bijection @xmath21 exists between two n - dimensional spacetimes which are both future and past distinguishing , then these spacetimes are conformally isometric when @xmath22 .",
    "[ mhkmlth ]    here , a _",
    "conformal isometry _ between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a bijection @xmath25 such that @xmath21 and @xmath26 are smooth and @xmath27 for some real , smooth , non - vanishing function @xmath28 .",
    "importantly , this implies that @xmath13 and @xmath14 have the same topology .",
    "the power of the mhkml theorem is evident .",
    "it tells us that the causal structure @xmath1 of an @xmath29-dimensional spacetime which is future and past distinguishing determines its conformal geometry and its topology .",
    "the _ only _ remaining geometric degree of freedom not determined by the causal structure is the conformal factor @xmath28 .",
    "this suggests an alternative , non - riemannian approach to lorentzian geometry in which a partially ordered set @xmath1 plays a primitive rather than a derivative role .",
    "indeed , the mhkml theorem provides a strong motivation for the causal set approach to quantum gravity in which a locally finite partially ordered set replaces the spacetime continuum @xcite .",
    "can the mhkml theorem be generalised to include spacetimes of different dimensions ?",
    "equivalently , are causal bijections rigid enough to constrain the spacetime dimension ?",
    "let us consider for the moment a special subclass of fpd spacetimes , namely those that are strongly causal .",
    "for such spacetimes , the alexandrov topology @xmath30 is a causal topology which is equivalent to the manifold topology @xmath31 ( theorem 4.24 in @xcite ) , so that @xmath1 determines the manifold topology and hence dimension .",
    "since a causal bijection @xmath21 preserves the chronological relation @xcite and hence the topology @xmath30 , this implies :    [ cor - one ] if there is a causal bijection between two strongly causal spacetimes then they both have the same manifold dimension and topology .",
    "this generalises the mhkml theorem when applied to strongly causal spacetimes .",
    "however , since @xmath30 is known to be strictly coarser than @xmath31 for spacetimes that are not strongly causal , it is an interesting question whether causal bijections impose topological constraints in such spacetimes . in this work ,",
    "we show that corollary [ cor - one ] can be generalised to spacetimes satisfying weaker causality conditions , i.e. , those that are either past _ or _ future distinguishing :    [ claim - two ] if there is a causal bijection between two future ( or past ) distinguishing spacetimes then they are of the same dimension .",
    "this gives us a genuine generalisation of the mhkml theorem to fpd spacetimes for spacetime dimension @xmath22 .",
    "thus for an fpd spacetime @xmath1 encodes the manifold topology and hence its dimension .",
    "this begs the question  what is the causal topology for fpd spacetimes that corresponds to the manifold topology ?",
    "we define a new causal topology @xmath32 derived from a convergence condition on sequences of _ chain intervals _ which are order theoretic analogs of null geodesic segments .",
    "we show that @xmath32 is equivalent to the manifold topology @xmath31 for an fpd spacetime in which the regions of strong causality violation satisfy a certain local achronality condition .",
    "in section [ prelims ] we briefly review some of the standard material on causal structure , in the process formalising many of the concepts and definition given in this section .",
    "we also define and discuss the properties of _ chain intervals _ which we use throughout our paper , not only to construct the new topology @xmath32 but also to give a _ local _ characterisation of strong causality and future and past distinguishability . in section [ mal ]",
    "we investigate the properties of fpd spacetimes in some detail and find some new and generic features .",
    "lemma [ claim - two ] follows from this analysis .    in section [ newtop ]",
    "we define a new convergence criterion on sequences of chain intervals from which we derive the causal topology @xmath32 .",
    "we show that for fpd spacetimes which satisfy an additional local achronality condition for the regions of strong causality violation , @xmath32 is equivalent to the manifold topology .",
    "this construction is inspired by the work of @xcite , where null geodesic segments are used instead of chain intervals , albeit with an entirely different motivation .",
    "indeed , a convergence condition using null geodesic segments instead of chain intervals always gives the manifold topology for fpd spacetimes , but since null geodesic segments are nt order theoretically defined , this does not give rise to a purely _ causal _ topology .",
    "the construction of @xmath32 via a convergence criterion however does not give us a causal basis .",
    "finding such a basis has proved difficult and we end this section with some speculative remarks .    in section [ other ]",
    "we examine another candidate for a causal topology inspired by a causal convergence criterion defined in @xcite .",
    "the convergence criterion used in @xcite gives rise to a causal topology @xmath33 which is strictly finer than @xmath31 and is hausdorff and equivalent to the path topology constructed by hawking - mccarthy - king @xcite ) iff the spacetime is past and future distinguishing .",
    "@xmath33 can alternatively be defined in terms of its basis elements , obtained from `` doubled '' chronological intervals and this makes it attractive to work with .",
    "we show that a natural extension of the convergence condition of @xcite gives rise to yet another distinct causal topology @xmath34 which is strictly coarser than @xmath33 and also strictly finer than @xmath31 when the spacetime is fpd .",
    "it is thus tempting to conclude that the the topological content of @xmath1 is far richer than one might have imagined and that further work could yield valuable insights .",
    "we give below the basic definitions and tools we will need for our paper , and refer the reader to the classic texts on causal structure @xcite for a more detailed exposition .",
