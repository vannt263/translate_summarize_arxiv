    "in addition to being of fundamental interest in physics , quantum entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information processing and distribution .",
    "popular candidates for experimental investigation in this context include trapped atoms , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) , and nonclassical light fields , using which a variety of impressive quantum state manipulations have now been demonstrated , including elementary quantum logic operations @xcite , preparation of quantum - mechanically entangled pairs @xcite and quadruplets @xcite of atoms , and quantum teleportation @xcite .    in recent work",
    "we have proposed a scheme that offers the possibility of combining the features of trapped atoms and nonclassical light fields in a distributed network @xcite ; in particular , a scheme that enables motional quantum states to be coupled to propagating ( nonclassical ) light fields via interactions in cavity qed .",
    "this coupling enables the _ deterministic _ generation and distribution of quantum entanglement between different atoms and/or different light fields .",
    "one particular example we have considered is the preparation of an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) state in the positions and momenta of a pair of distantly - separated trapped atoms @xcite , which in turn leads to a scheme for the teleportation of motional quantum states @xcite .    for the proposals presented in @xcite entanglement of the atoms motional states",
    "is achieved through the transfer of entanglement from the quantum - correlated output light fields from a nondegenerate parametric amplifier . however , as pointed out in @xcite , the trapped - atom cavity qed setup can itself act as a source of nonclassical light fields ; nonclassical motional states ( prepared by some means independent of the atom - cavity coupling ) can be transferred to the propagating output field from the cavity , which can in turn be coupled to the motion of a second atom confined inside another , distant cavity .",
    "the potential of such a trapped - atom nonclassical light source is underscored by the impressive control with which the motional quantum states of single trapped atoms can be controlled and , more especially , by the variety of nonclassical motional states that have in fact been prepared experimentally @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper , then , is to expand upon this idea and present schemes whereby `` local '' entanglement of orthogonal motional modes of a single atom ( or of a few atoms ) trapped inside an optical cavity is transformed , via propagating light fields , into `` nonlocal '' entanglement of the motional modes of distantly - separated atoms . in this way",
    ", the need for nonlinear ( quantum ) optical devices , such as nondegenerate parametric amplifiers , is eliminated , and all of the desired operations are achieved using only trapped - atom cavity qed configuratons .    in section",
    "ii we present a relatively simple example of a scheme for the manipulation of the motional state of a trapped atom ( or atoms ) in two dimensions using only ( external ) laser fields .",
    "this scheme allows entanglement to be established between two orthogonal modes and the results of some numerical simulations for the case of a two - mode `` squeezed '' state of the motion are presented .",
    "section iii describes the trapped - atom cavity qed system that facilitates the motion - light coupling and is , of course , central to our proposals ; through this coupling , the quantum state ( i.e. , the entanglement ) of one of the two relevant motional modes can be `` mapped onto '' a propagating light field and transferred to a distant site .",
    "we examine this system in some detail , presenting numerical calculations that further the original analysis of @xcite , looking more closely , for example , at the lamb - dicke ( tight confinement ) assumption involved in the model . having described means for preparing `` local '' entanglement of motional modes and for transferring motional quantum states between distant atoms , the preparation of distributed `` nonlocal '' motional state entanglement follows naturally , and in section iv we discuss several examples , such as the position - momentum epr state and delocalized mesoscopic states of the motion .",
    "schemes for coupling and manipulating orthogonal motional modes in a single - atom trap have been put forward by a variety of authors @xcite , typically involving stimulated - raman transitions between internal atomic states . here , we describe one such scheme , outlining how certain effective interaction hamiltonians ( of particular interest to us ) may be realized and presenting some numerical simulations .",
    "this scheme involves only a single internal atomic level ( after adiabatic elimination of the excited internal state ) and generalizes to two dimensions a technique already used in ion - trap experiments to prepare , for example , one - dimensional squeezed states of the motion @xcite .      in this scheme ,",
    "counterpropagating laser beams aligned ( in our case ) in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and coupled to the same internal atomic transition induce a coupling between orthogonal ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) motional modes which , depending on the detuning between the two laser fields , may take the form of a linear mixer or a nondegenerate parametric amplifier .",
    "the physical setup is depicted in fig .",
    "mathematically , the situation is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the harmonic oscillation frequencies along the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes of the trap , @xmath5 are annihilation operators for the quantized atomic motion , and @xmath6 is the atomic lowering operator for the @xmath7 transition .",
    "the total field incident on the atom is given by @xmath8 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined by the angle of incidence in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and satisfy @xmath11 .",

    "the detunings @xmath15 and @xmath16 are given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the atomic transition frequency and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the frequencies of the two counterpropagating fields .",
    "with the assumption that @xmath15 is large , the atomic excited state can be adiabatically eliminated and spontaneous emission neglected . in the heisenberg equations of motion one makes the substitution @xmath22 which gives , for the motional mode operators , @xmath23 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    moving to a rotating frame with respect to the motion , i.e.",
    ", defining @xmath28 , and making the lamb - dicke approximation , i.e. , expanding the exponentials to first order in @xmath29 , one derives @xmath30 ( and similarly for @xmath31 ) .",
    "this equation contains a variety of terms oscillating at a variety of different frequencies . with a judicious choice of the detuning @xmath16 between the two laser fields ,",
    "a particular term can have its time dependence removed , whereas the other ( oscillating ) terms can , provided the trap frequencies are sufficiently large ( and _ different _ ) , be neglected in a rotating - wave approximation .",
    "we now consider two cases of interest to us .      to realize a linear mixing of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes ( i.e. , a beamsplitter - type interaction ) , we choose the detuning between the two incident laser fields to be @xmath32 .",
    "with this choice , only one term in ( [ tbxd ] ) is `` stationary '' , while all of the other terms retain oscillatory factors .",
    "provided the frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath33 are large compared to the effective coupling strength between the two modes , these oscillatory terms can be dropped in a rotating - wave approximation , leaving @xmath34 the effective interaction hamiltonian is thus @xmath35 with the interaction strength given by @xmath36 the physical process corresponding to this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "particular cases of interest are those in which the interaction is turned on for a time @xmath37 such that @xmath38 or @xmath39 ( we assume rectangular pulse shapes ) ; the first case effects an operation equivalent to a 50/50 beamsplitter , while in the second case the result is a complete exchange of states between the two modes , i.e. , for @xmath40 one finds @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "note also that , given suitable ( unentangled ) initial states of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes ( prepared by some other means ) , one can generate entanglement with the beamsplitter ( @xmath38 ) operation .",
    "for example , an initial product of number states , @xmath43 is transformed via a 50/50 beamsplitter operation into an entangled state of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are certain coefficients .",
    "alternatively , we may choose @xmath47 , in which case , following the same assumptions as above , one derives @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 with @xmath50 as before .",
    "the physical process corresponding to this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) ; it is of course a parametric amplification process , which leads to `` two - mode squeezing '' .",
    "taking @xmath51 , the state produced after an interaction time @xmath37 , given the modes are initially in their ground vibrational levels ( achieved , for example , by sideband cooling ) , is @xmath52^{-1 } \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\left [ -\\tanh ( r ) \\right]^m \\ , |m\\rangle_{x}\\otimes |m\\rangle_{z } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 are fock states of the motional modes and @xmath54 is the two - mode squeezing operator @xcite , @xmath55 \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath56 .",
    "the entanglement between modes that is generated by this process is best expressed in terms of position and momentum variables .",
    "in particular , one can show for the state ( [ psixz ] ) that the wigner function in these variables is @xmath57 e^{+2r } \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\times \\ ;   \\exp \\left\\ { -\\left [ ( \\tilde{x}-\\tilde{z})^2 + ( \\tilde{p}_x+\\tilde{p}_z)^2\\right ] e^{-2r } \\right\\ }   \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\sim c\\ ; \\delta ( \\tilde{x}+\\tilde{z})\\,\\delta ( \\tilde{p}_x-\\tilde{p}_z ) \\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm for } \\;{\\rm large}\\;\\ , r , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 a constant @xcite .",
    "this , of course , corresponds to the original state considered by einstein , podolsky , and rosen in their famous gedanken experiment @xcite , although , in this particular situation the position and momentum variables belong to the same particle .",
    "however , as we will describe below , through our scheme for motion - light coupling we are able to distribute this entanglement between two distantly - separated atoms .      before describing the scheme for distribution of motional state entanglement",
    ", we consider the results of some numerical simulations of the state manipulation schemes proposed above . by numerical simulation , we mean direct integration of the schrdinger equation @xmath59 which is the form one obtains upon adiabatically eliminating the atomic excited state .",
    "truncated number state bases are used to describe the harmonic oscillator modes describing the two - dimensional motion .",
    "we have focussed in our work on the two - mode squeezing , or epr entanglement , operation of the previous subsection , determining in particular suitable parameter regimes for the efficient implementation of the scheme ( requirements for the linear mixing scheme are basically the same ) . as a measure of",
    "how well the scheme works , we consider the fidelity @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the simulated wave function after a time @xmath37 , and @xmath56 with @xmath50 given by ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "[ [ results ] ] results + + + + + + +    sample values of @xmath62 are given in table i for a number of different combinations of trapping frequencies and lamb - dicke parameters .",
    "as one can see , two - mode squeezed states exhibiting significant degrees of entanglement ( @xmath63 ) can be prepared with high fidelity given sufficiently small lamb - dicke parameters and sufficiently large @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath33 ( compared to @xmath50 ) .",
    "it becomes computationally prohibitive for us to consider values of @xmath64 much larger than @xmath65 , owing to the large number state bases required to cover adequately the population distribution of the two - mode squeezed state .",
    "however , the results presented here suggest that , for example , a state with @xmath66 could be prepared with a fidelity exceeding 0.9 for physically reasonable parameters .    [ [ experimental - prospects ] ] experimental prospects + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if we take the example of trapped @xmath67 ions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 correspond to actual trap frequencies @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( which are essentially the frequencies achieved in the experiments of monroe and coworkers @xcite ) , and thus , for the example given in the table , to a value of the interaction strength @xmath72 and a timescale for the preparation of the entangled state on the order of @xmath73",
    ". this should of course be much smaller than the timescale for motional state decoherence due to , for example , spontaneous emission , which we have neglected in our analysis .",
    "the rate of spontaneous emission events influencing the motional dynamics ( i.e. , incoherent scattering ) can be estimated to be on the order of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the atomic excited state lifetime ( see appendix a , part 1 ) .",
    "choosing @xmath76 , this rate can evidently be made much smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "two or more _ ions _ confined in a linear ion trap @xcite interact strongly through coulomb repulsion and their motion along the axis of the trap is best described in terms of collective modes of vibration .",
    "such collective modes have , of course , been fundamental to ion - trap quantum computer proposals @xcite . in the present context",
    ", we wish to point out that the schemes of section ii.a could also be used to couple and entangle orthogonal collective modes of a linear chain of trapped ions .",
    "to illustrate this , we consider for simplicity just a pair of trapped ions confined in a harmonic potential and aligned along the @xmath1-axis , as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "assuming very strong confinement in the @xmath0 direction ( so that the motion along this axis can be regarded as independent of the @xmath1-axis collective motion ) , the quantized ( two - dimensional ) motion of the ions can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are harmonic oscillator annihilation operators for single - ion motion along the @xmath0-axis , for the center - of - mass motion along the @xmath1-axis , and for the relative motion along the @xmath1-axis , respectively .",
    "the frequencies of the collective modes are related to the single - ion mode frequency by @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .    to couple the various modes via laser light , excitation of only a single ion",
    "is necessary , and this excitation takes the same form as described by ( [ 2modeh ] ) and ( [ e_l ] ) ; that is , we take @xmath83 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath84 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expressed in terms of the collective mode operators , one has @xcite",
    "@xmath85 with the collective mode lamb - dicke parameters given by @xmath86 as before , the atomic excited state is adiabatically eliminated and the position - dependent functions are expanded to first order in the various lamb - dicke parameters .",
    "the resulting heisenberg equations of motion for the mode operators again display couplings between the modes with varying time dependencies , and again with a judicious choice of the detuning @xmath16 one can `` select '' a particular coupling ( neglecting the others in a rotating - wave approximation ) , provided the frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are sufficiently large and different .",
    "the effective interaction hamiltonians one can realize are thus ( in the rotating frame ) @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath24 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "so , one again realizes linear mixers and parametric amplifiers , only now one of the modes is a collective mode for the two ions . with the addition of more ions ,",
    "one introduces more collective modes , but the frequencies of these modes remain incommensurate and ( for large @xmath4 ) well - separated @xcite , implying that the above working could be readily generalized to three or more ions .",
    "the basic setup we use to couple motion to light was originally considered by zeng and lin @xcite .",
    "this setup consists of a two - level atom confined in a harmonic trap located inside an optical cavity .",
    "the atomic transition of frequency @xmath19 is coupled to a single mode of the cavity field of frequency @xmath93 and is also driven by an external ( classical ) laser field of frequency @xmath94 .",
    "the physical setup and excitation scheme are depicted in fig .",
    "the cavity is aligned along the @xmath0-axis , while the laser field is incident from a direction along the @xmath95-axis ( i.e. , perpendicular to the @xmath0-axis ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the atom - cavity system , including the atomic motion , takes the form ( in a frame rotating at the laser frequency , @xmath94 ) @xmath96 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\ ; + \\ , \\hbar g_0 \\sin ( k\\hat{x } ) ( \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\sigma}_- + \\hat{\\sigma}_+\\hat{a } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\ ; + \\ ,   \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm c }   + \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm c}^\\dagger \\hat{a }   + \\hat{\\sigma}_+ \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm a }   + \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\sigma}_- .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath97 are the harmonic oscillation frequencies along the principal axes of the trap , @xmath5 and @xmath98 are annihilation operators for the quantized atomic motion and cavity field , respectively , @xmath6 is the atomic lowering operator , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 is the ( possibly time - dependent ) amplitude of laser field a. the single - photon atom - cavity dipole coupling strength is given by @xmath102 , while the sine function describes the standing wave structure of the cavity field  we assume that the centre of the trap is located at a _",
    "node _ of the cavity field .",
    "finally , the last two terms in ( [ h ] ) describe the couplings of the cavity field mode and the atomic transition to `` reservoirs '' of external field modes ( with @xmath103 the `` reservoir annihilation operators '' ) , which produce damping of the cavity field and ( free - space ) atomic spontaneous emission , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that we will neglect any forms of motional decoherence associated with the trap itself .",
    "heisenberg equations of motion are straightforwardly derived from the above hamiltonian .",
    "assuming the detunings of the light fields from the atomic transition frequency to be very large [ i.e. , @xmath104 , atomic spontaneous emission can be neglected and the internal atomic dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated . in the equations of motion , this is done by making the replacement @xmath105\\ ] ] in the equations describing the cavity and motional degrees of freedom .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath106",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\ ; + \\ ,   \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm c }   + \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm c}^\\dagger \\hat{a } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the size of the harmonic trap is assumed to be small compared to the optical wavelength ( lamb - dicke approximation ) ; this enables the approximations @xmath107 , and @xmath108 [ with @xmath109 real ] .",
    "this second approximation would follow , for example , if the laser field forms a standing wave with the trap centered at an antinode , i.e. , with @xmath110 , for @xmath111 ( for further discussion of this approximation , see appendix b ) .",
    "to second order in @xmath112 , quantum langevin equations for the field and @xmath0-dimension motional modes are then @xmath113 where we have defined @xmath114 while the operator @xmath115 obeys the commutation relation @xmath116 = \\delta ( t - t^\\prime ) $ ] and describes the quantum noise input to the cavity field from the external field ( in a frame rotating at the cavity frequency ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath117 is the cavity field decay rate .",
    "next , we choose the detuning between the cavity and laser fields to be @xmath118 . in the above equations this results in `` resonant '' and `` non - resonant '' terms . with the assumption that the trap frequency @xmath3 is large ( which is consistent with the lamb - dicke assumption , since @xmath119 ) , such that",
    "@xmath120 , the non - resonant , or counter - rotating terms can be neglected in a rotating - wave approximation .",
    "this leads to the pair of equations @xmath121 the terms of second order in @xmath112 describe phonon- or photon - number - dependent phase shifts ; these will in general be very small and can be neglected ( although they are retained for numerical calculations ) @xcite , which means that the effective interaction between the cavity and motional modes is simply a linear coupling of the form @xmath122      although not essential for our purposes , a further simplification of the dynamics is possible if the decay rate @xmath117 of the cavity field is sufficiently large that the cavity mode dynamics can also be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "in particular , if @xmath123 ( but still with @xmath124 ) , then the equation for the motional mode reduces to @xmath125 \\hat{b}_x +   e^{i\\phi_{\\rm a}}\\sqrt{2\\gamma ( t ) } \\ , e^{-i\\nu_x t } \\hat{a}_{\\rm in}(t)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where we define @xmath126 the motional dynamics thus reduces to that of a simple damped harmonic oscillator , with the ( possibly ) time - dependent damping rate @xmath127 .",
    "however , the quantum noise operator appearing in ( [ qle ] ) corresponds to the _ light field _",
    "incident upon the cavity , and hence one realizes a simple coupling of the motional mode to _ propagating light fields _ external to the cavity . more precisely , from the input - output theory of optical cavities @xcite , it can be shown that the cavity output field is given , under the present circumstances , by @xmath128 where @xmath129 , and we have set @xmath130 for simplicity .",
    "so , given a vacuum input field to the cavity , the output light field is _ determined by the motional state of the atom _ confined inside the cavity . in this way , nonclassical motional states can be converted into nonclassical light fields ; for example , entanglement between the @xmath0-dimension motional mode and , say , the @xmath1-dimension motional mode can be converted into entanglement between the @xmath1-dimension motional mode and the propagating output light field .",
    "this light field may then be coupled to another atom - cavity system to generate distributed motional state entanglement .      following work by cirac",
    "_ et al_. @xcite on the transmission of a qubit between two nodes of a quantum network , it is shown in @xcite that if the output field from one of our atom - cavity configurations is incident on a second such atom - cavity configuration , with the coupling between systems being _ unidirectional _ , then with suitably tailored laser pulses @xmath131 and @xmath132 applied at the two sites ( amounting essentially to impedance matching , such that all of the light exiting the first cavity is absorbed by the second cavity ) one may realize the motional state transfer @xmath133 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ quantum state describing the motion along the @xmath0-axis . note that the cavity fields begin and end the transfer in the vacuum state .",
    "the scheme is able to operate in the regime where @xmath134 and @xmath117 are comparable ( in which case the transfer rate is essentially determined by @xmath117 ) , but again the analysis simplifies in the case where the cavity modes can be adiabatically eliminated as above . in this case , a master equation for the reduced density matrix describing the motional states of the two atoms , @xmath135 , can be derived ( in the rotating frame ) as @xcite @xmath136 e^{-i(\\phi_{\\rm 1a}-\\phi_{\\rm 2a } ) } \\right .",

    "is interrupted at random times @xmath197 by wave function collapses , or quantum jumps , @xmath198 ( which include renormalization of the wave function ) , where @xmath199 is an appropriate jump operator and the probability density for a jump to occur during the time interval from @xmath167 to @xmath200 is @xmath201 . for our situation",
    "the jump operator is @xmath202 which can be identified with the destructive detection of a photon by the photodetector monitoring the output channel from the second cavity .    for ideal quantum transmission",
    "we require that a quantum jump ( that is , a photon detection ) never occurs , i.e. , @xmath203 for all times @xmath167 ( which also means that the norm of the wave function remains equal to 1 at all times ) .",
    "in other words , all of the quantum information is transferred from atom 1 to atom 2 and none is lost to light fields propagating away from the system .",
    "the laser pulse profiles derived from the simplified master equation model ( [ mecascade ] ) should approximately satisfy this condition and facilitate high - fidelity state transfer , provided the various parameters of the system are chosen appropriately . here",

    "now , in a typical application of the monte - carlo wave function approach one averages over many trajectories to obtain a density operator for the system . from this density operator",
    "one could , in the present context , compute the average fidelity for the quantum state transmission .",
    "however , the decay of the norm in a single trajectory already provides us with a good indicator of the performance of the transmission .",
    "if , for example , during the pulse sequence and state transfer the norm decays to a value of 0.9 ( without any jumps occurring ) , then we can make the general statement that in 90% of our attempts the state will be transferred successfully .",
    "note that , in the `` no - jump '' case , on renormalizing the simulated wave function @xmath212 ( where @xmath213 is the finishing time for the simulation ) we find that the fidelity of the transmission , defined to be @xmath214 is very close to 1 ( i.e. , @xmath215 ) for all of the numerical examples we consider below .",

    ", it is also worth noting that it would in principle be possible to post - select high - fidelity state transmissions by monitoring the output from the second cavity .",
    "if a photon is _ not _ detected in this output then the transmission is known to have been successful ( assuming perfect detection efficiency ) . if a photon is detected then the system can be reset and the transfer attempted again ( or some form of error correction procedure could be applied ) .",

    "a value @xmath229 is necessary if one wishes to obtain a success rate exceeding @xmath230% for the case @xmath227 .",
    "as the dimensionality of the motional state being transferred increases ( i.e. , higher fock states are populated ) , the size of @xmath112 also becomes more critical .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the results in tables [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] .",
    "smaller values of @xmath112 are clearly required ( for a given value of @xmath3 ) in order for the state @xmath231 to be transferred with a fidelity comparable to that for the state @xmath232 .",

    "the effect of quantum jumps on the transfer is , as one would expect , more severe than in the case of the phase state ; overlap with the state @xmath234 disappears completely with a single photon detection .",
    "however , after the jump the resulting final state is not necessarily what one might naively expect ( i.e. , the state @xmath235 ) .",

    "one would anticipate a state transfer rate @xmath253  khz .",

    "much larger cavity finesses may be possible , but challenging , at this wavelength , allowing smaller mirror separation and larger dipole coupling strength @xmath102 ( which increases as the cavity mode volume decreases ) .",
    "however , it may be difficult in practice to bring mirrors very close together about an ion trap ( for example , because of the technical problem of charge build - up on the mirrors ) .",
    "for this reason , it is perhaps advantageous to consider neutral atom experiments ( in particular , alkali atom experiments ) , where , in fact , optical dipole traps ( see , for example , @xcite ) or microscopic magnetic traps ( see , for example , @xcite ) should allow confinement of atoms in the lamb - dicke regime with trapping frequencies also in the mhz range . furthermore , cavity qed experiments with alkali atoms are already highly developed ( for recent experiments , see @xcite ) and spectacular cavity finesses can be achieved at the relevant ( longer ) wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider the possibility of having more than one atom coupled to the cavity field at a time .",
    "the kind of situation one might imagine is like that realized in the recent experiment of ye _",
    "et al_. @xcite , in which ( single ) atoms were trapped inside a microscopic optical cavity using a far - off - resonance dipole - force trap ( fort ) . the fort was actually produced by excitation of an `` auxiliary '' longitudinal cavity mode , and so had a standing - wave structure colinear with ( but of slightly different periodicity to ) the cavity qed mode of interest .",

    "so , through the laser and cavity fields one realizes a coupling between the motional modes of different atoms .",
    "now , defining the `` collective '' mode operator @xmath269 with @xmath270 ( such that @xmath271=1 $ ] ) , one finds @xmath272 with @xmath273 .",
    "this points to the possibility of using the collective mode for quantum state transfer and storage @xcite .",
    "a potential advantage of such an approach is the enhanced effective transfer rate @xmath274 , which ( for @xmath275 ) should enable the requirement of strong - coupling cavity qed to be relaxed somewhat .",
    "the possibility also arises for the preparation of some very interesting many - atom entangled states .",
    "for example , motional state transfer of a schrdinger cat state @xmath237 to the collective mode , perhaps from a single - atom ( cavity qed ) source , would result in a many - atom state of the form ( omitting the normalization ) @xmath276 .",
    "earlier , we discussed a scheme for coupling orthogonal single - ion and many - ion collective vibrational modes using a pair of laser fields .",
    "this scheme could also be utilized in the context of state transfer and storage , albeit somewhat indirectly , as depicted in fig .  7 . in particular ,",
    "state transfer between motion and light and from one cavity location to another could be achieved using a single - ion interaction with the field mode ( assuming that individual addressing of the ion by the coupling laser is possible ) , after which the ion - cavity coupling is switched off and the coupling between the single - ion mode and a particular collective motional mode is switched on ( for example , to transfer a quantum state from the single - ion mode to the collective mode ) .",
    "storage of quantum information in certain collective vibrational modes could be advantageous due to the very slow heating rates experienced by these modes @xcite .",
    "having described and analysed basic techniques for preparing `` local '' entanglement of vibrational modes , and then for coupling vibrational modes to propagating light fields , we now want to outline some specific and interesting possibilities for distribution of entanglement between distant locations .",
    "the procedure is straightforward : one prepares an entangled state of the orthogonal vibrational modes in the @xmath0- and , say , @xmath1-directions , after which the @xmath0 mode is coupled to the cavity and thence to the external light field . with appropriate time - dependent coupling",
    "we have seen that the properties of the @xmath0 mode can be transferred with high fidelity to the corresponding mode of a distant cavity - confined atom ( or atoms ) .",
    "that is , we can perform the transformation @xmath277 where @xmath278 is a vibrational fock state of the atom at location @xmath279 .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes of the atoms at locations 2 and 1 , respectively , become entangled .",

    "so , one prepares an epr state in position and momentum of a pair of ( distantly ) separated atoms .",
    "apart from being of great historical significance , this state also constitutes the essential resource for the teleportation of continuous variables @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the present context it offers the possibility of teleporting atomic center - of - mass wave functions between distant sites @xcite .      as mentioned earlier , the linear mixing operation described by ( [ mixer ] ) can also generate entanglement given suitable initial states .",
    "consider , for example , the situation in which , say , the @xmath1 mode is initially prepared in its ground state while the @xmath0 mode is prepared in a schrdinger cat state , i.e. , @xmath285 application of the linear mixing operation for a time @xmath286 will transform this into the state @xmath287 the state transfer procedure then generates the delocalized state @xmath288 from what we have seen in our numerical analysis , the coherent state amplitude @xmath9 can be reasonably large ( while still allowing high fidelity operations and transfers ) , and so the entangled state ( [ delocoh ] ) could be regarded as a delocalized _ mesoscopic _ state @xcite .      through the many - atom configurations discussed in sections iii.d and iii.e one can generalize the entanglement distribution procedure to collections of trapped atoms or ions located at the distant sites .",
    "for example , one could imagine entangling _ collective vibrational _ modes of two strings of trapped ions at separate locations . such schemes complement proposals for entangling _ collective internal _ atomic states of separated free - space atomic ensembles using propagating light fields ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in this work we have described and analysed schemes ( i ) for producing motional state entanglement of an atom ( or atoms ) at one location and ( ii ) for distributing this entanglement between atoms at distant locations .",
    "the particular example we have focussed on for generating ( local ) entanglement was chosen for its relative simplicity and for its close relation to schemes already implemented in the laboratory . a further motivating factor which should also be emphasized",
    "is that the operations that it allows are of direct relevance to quantum communication and computing with continuous variables , for which squeezers and linear mixers are basic elements ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the cavity - qed - based motional state transfer scheme that enables the entanglement to be distributed between distant sites has been introduced elsewhere @xcite , but the present work extends significantly the numerical analysis of this scheme .",
    "in particular , we have considered the transfer of what may be regarded as mesoscopic motional states and from this we have been able to gauge the validity of some of the more fundamental assumptions implicit in the scheme , such as the lamb - dicke and rotating - wave approximations .",
    "our calculations suggest that states of a substantial `` size '' can be transferred with high fidelity for physically reasonable parameter values and we have discussed some possible experimental scenarios , encouraged by spectacular recent advances in atom and ion trapping technology and in cavity qed .",
    "the possibilities offered by the schemes for distributed entanglement are many and varied , and we have discussed just a few examples in section iv , along with some possible applications such as quantum teleportation of atomic wavepackets . of course ,",
