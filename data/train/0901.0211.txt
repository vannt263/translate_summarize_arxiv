    "the optical and electronic properties of low - dimensional materials have been an important subject of study in the field of condensed matter physics . in particular ,",

    "we assume that the formation of @xmath16 excitons occurs in a very short time scale after an optical excitation around @xmath6 , because of much faster @xmath6-to-@xmath16 relaxation ( e.g. , @xmath340  fs  @xcite ) than the duration of our opa pulse ( @xmath3250  fs ) .",
    "thus , excitons quickly accumulate in the @xmath16 state during and right after photo - creation of @xmath0-@xmath1 pairs .",
    "however , the number of excitons that can be _ accommodated _ in the @xmath16 state is limited by eea . as the exciton density , @xmath17 , approaches its maximum value , eea begins to prevent a further increase by _ efficiently removing excitons non - radiatively _ , which explains the pl saturation behavior .",
    "since eea serves as a bottleneck for the exciton density , the pl intensity becomes insensitive to whether the excitons were created resonantly or non - resonantly around the @xmath6 level and independent of the pump wavelength , resulting in the flattening of ple spectra .",
    "namely , at very high pump fluences , the pl intensity is determined not by how efficiently excitons are created but by _ how many @xmath16 excitons can be accommodated within a particular type of swnt _ as well as by the relative abundance of that type of swnt in the sample .",
    "we also performed optical transmission spectroscopy in the @xmath6 range using opa pulses and found that the absorption spectra do not exhibit any change even at high pulse fluences .",
    "thus , nonlinear optical effects such as phase - space filling in the @xmath6 range are not playing any role in the observed ple broadening / flattening and pl saturation .",
    "in this section , we develop a theoretical model for explaining the experimental results , taking into account the generation , diffusion - limited eea , and spontaneous decays of 1-d excitons . under certain approximations , the model provides a direct analytical relationship between the intensity of the excitation light ( @xmath15 ) and that of the emitted pl ( @xmath14 ) for limiting cases , which allows us to estimate the density of excitons in swnts through fitting to the experimentally obtained @xmath15 vs.  @xmath14 curves .",
