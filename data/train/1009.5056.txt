    "the focus of this paper is to develop and display a relationship between the coefficient polynomials of the polynomial .",

    "such material may be found in any introductory textbook , as for example k.  murasugi s , @xcite , and may also be found in many excellent surveys , @xcite .",
    "the attraction in using a braid word as the starting point for naming a link is that it not only immediately informs the reader of the exact link under discussion , but the braid word itself may be manipulated using the braid relations for the braid group . while there are many braid words that describe the same link , there is still much to be gained from the braid approach , as this paper hopes to demonstrate .",
    "the remainder of this section will introduce the terms and notation used in the paper .",
    "the second section will introduce the primary results , whose proofs will appear in the third section . applications ( section  [ threebraids ] ) include the result that the jones and polynomials distinguish the same three - braid links",
    ". the third section will also introduce the necessary tools and formulas to facilitate the proofs .",
    "the conventions used in this paper largely follow those in , @xcite , to which the reader is referred for expanded discussion . a brief review of the standard symbols and terminology used in the paper is given here for reference .",
    "the braid group on @xmath1 strands , @xmath2 , has @xmath3 standard generators , @xmath4 .",
    "if a braid word , @xmath5 , has the expression @xmath6 , with @xmath7 for each subscript , @xmath8 ,    the braid length is @xmath9 and is denoted @xmath10 ,    the exponent sum , or writhe , denoted @xmath11 or @xmath12 , is @xmath13 .",
    "a syllable of a braid word is a maximal subword of identical subscripts ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "a syllable is reduced when all its exponents have the same sign .",
    "a braid word is in standard form when all syllables are reduced .",
    "the writhe is actually associated with the braid diagram , rather than the braid word itself , but this imprecision in usage causes no problems . an @xmath1-braid word whose twist exponents are all zero is defined to have zero length and writhe .",
    "if a braid word , @xmath5 , is in standard form and has the expression @xmath6 , with @xmath7 for each subscript , @xmath8 ,    any generator that appears in a unique syllable is called a clustered generator ,    any generator that appears exactly once in @xmath14 is called a trivial generator ,    a set of generators with subscripts in a range , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , yields a new braid word , @xmath17 , that belongs to @xmath18 .",

    "the link diagrams referenced in this paper will typically be associated with a braid word , but the skein relation , ( [ hskeinrel ] ) , for the polynomial , @xmath28 , is defined more generally to allow any valid oriented diagram , @xmath29 , for the link .",
    "the diagrams , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 below refer to the usual diagrams for the link with positive crossing , null ( smoothed ) crossing , and negative crossing , respectively .",
    "@xmath33    the importance of the polynomial derives from the fact it is the same for all diagrams of a given link , and so is an invariant of the oriented link .",
    "the major skein polynomials and their definitions are : the conway polynomial , @xmath34 , the jones polynomial , @xmath35 , and the alexander polynomial , @xmath36 .",
    "the torus links are much studied due to their uniformity , symmetry , and other properties .",
    "the torus links are characterized by the number of full rows of twists , @xmath37 , together with the number of strands , @xmath38 , denoted @xmath39 .",

    "the corresponding conway polynomial is so central to the results of this paper that the lengthy expression , @xmath44 , will be shortened to @xmath45 or even @xmath46 . among many other interesting properties of the conway polynomial ( section  [ conwayproperties ] )",

    "given that the polynomial is a function of two variables , one obvious way to organize its expression is as a polynomial in a single variable , with coefficients that are simply polynomials in the second variable .",
    "the question as to which variable should be the primary organizing factor may depend on circumstances , but a powerful motivation exists to chose @xmath53 from ( [ hskeinrel ] ) .",
    "this is due to the remarkable results , @xcite , @xcite , known as the morton - franks - williams inequality , that give bounds on the possible values for the highest and lowest powers of @xmath53 .",
    "the first step is to observe that the polynomial for a link with a given braid representation ( @xmath54 ) may be organized in a standard form , ( [ hstdform ] ) , in which the @xmath55 are ordinary polynomials with integer coefficients .",
    "an equivalent form appears in ( [ hlaurentform ] ) , in which the @xmath56 , are laurent polynomials with integer coefficients , and @xmath57 .",
    "when multiple braid words are under discussion , the symbols @xmath58 , or @xmath59 , may be used for clarity ; note that the argument , @xmath60 , may be omitted .",

    "jones published a number of results relating properties of hecke algebras to knot theory , @xcite . this landmark research displayed , among other insights , how the two variable skein polynomial could be calculated from the burau representation of a braid .",
    "unfortunately for knot theorists , the expression for the two variable skein polynomial is of nontrivial complexity .",
    "a further wrinkle in using the methodology is it requires knowledge of the number of link components , or at least whether this number is even or odd . for three - braid links ,",

    "it is expected that the sum of the laurent coefficient polynomials will be the conway polynomial , but more is true .",
    "the following theorem introduces a system of linear equations , with coefficients in the ring of polynomials over the integers , that is satisfied by the laurent coefficient polynomials , @xmath56 .",
    "the laurent coefficient polynomials for a link , @xmath86 , with @xmath5 , satisfy the following relations .",
    "these are independent for @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88    any set of @xmath1 functions , @xmath89 , that satisfy both equations , will also satisfy the following family of equations for each integer , @xmath90 : @xmath91    [ hlaurentcoeffrel ]    in the prior theorem , independent means that for a fixed choice of @xmath11 and @xmath1 , an arbitrary set of laurent polynomials with integer coefficients , @xmath92 , that satisfy one of the equations need not satisfy the other equation .",
