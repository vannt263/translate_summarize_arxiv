    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is one of the nearest galaxies .",
    "the proximity of the lmc ( @xmath450 kpc ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to study individual stars in detail .",
    "the mean metallicity of the lmc is also known to be small ( @xmath41/4 ) compared to the solar abundance ( e.g. , luck et al . 1998 ) , providing us with an ideal place to study formation and evolution of stars in low metallicity environments .",
    "individual stars in the lmc have been observed by large area surveys at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "@xcite detected about @xmath5 point sources in a @xmath6 survey over a 64 deg@xmath1 area of the lmc , whereas @xcite observed about @xmath7 point sources with a @xmath8 survey of a 40 deg@xmath1 region . at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths , the _ midcourse space experiment ( msx ) _ carried out a survey over a 100 deg@xmath1 area of the lmc @xcite and detected a few thousand sources despite of the short integration time and low spatial resolution .",
    "two recent infrared satellites , _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite and _ akari _ @xcite , provided a capability of deep mid - infrared observations with better spatial resolution .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "sage project @xcite carried out a uniform and unbiased imaging survey of a 49 deg@xmath1 area of the lmc at 4 photometric bands from 3 to 8 @xmath0 m of irac @xcite and 3 bands at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m of mips @xcite , to which the sage - spec performed follow - up spectroscopic observations in the mir and far - infrared ( fir ) @xcite . recently _ herschel space observatory _ also made a survey observation over a @xmath9 area of the lmc with spatial resolution higher than _ spitzer _ in the fir @xcite .",
    "the _ akari _ large magellanic cloud survey consists of a nir to mir imaging and near - infrared spectroscopic survey toward the lmc .",
    "the survey aims at a thorough study of the lifecycle of matters and the star - formation history of the lmc on a galactic scale owing to its wide spatial coverage and high sensitivities over the wide spectral range @xcite .",
    "the sensitivities are comparable to those of the _ spitzer _ sage survey and the _ akari _ survey covers the mir spectral range contiguously , which fills the gap between the _ spitzer_/irac and mips bands .",
    "in addition to the dedicated survey observations , the entire lmc was observed as part of the all - sky survey at 6 bands from the mir to the fir @xcite . the mir point source catalog at 9 and 18 @xmath0 m and the fir point source catalog at 65 , 90 , 140 and 160 @xmath0 m have been produced from the all - sky survey observations and released to the public @xcite .",
    "these _ akari _ observations provide 11 band data of the lmc from the nir to the fir , which give us a unique and useful database for the study of the lmc .    a brief description of the _ akari _ lmc survey and early results have been given in @xcite based on a preliminary version of the catalog .",
    "the catalog has been revised by improving the data reduction procedure , which increases the reliability and accuracy of the photometric results . in this paper",
    ", we describe the point source catalog from the imaging survey of the lmc from the nir to the mir using the latest version of the data reduction process , which will be released to the public .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the _ akari _ telescope has an effective aperture of 685 mm @xcite and the whole telescope system including the focal - plane instruments was cooled by liquid helium and onboard mechanical coolers .",
    "the _ akari _",
    "spacecraft was brought into a sun - synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 700 km along the twilight zone , similar to that of the _ iras _ satellite .",
    "the lmc is located near the south ecliptic pole , where the polar orbit has high visibility . taking this advantage , we observed the main part of the lmc contiguously .",
    "the _ akari _ lmc survey was carried out with the infrared camera ( irc : @xcite ) in the pointing observation mode @xcite .",
    "it has 3 independent channels : nir ( 1.8@xmath105.5 @xmath0 m ) , mir - s ( 4.6@xmath1013.4 @xmath0 m ) , and mir - l ( 12.6@xmath1026.5 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "each channel has a wide field of view ( fov ) of about 10@xmath11 @xmath12 10@xmath11 and is equipped with 3 imaging filters and 2 dispersion elements , which can be switched during a pointing observation . of these",
    ", we use 5 imaging filters at 3.2 ( n3 ) , 7 ( s7 ) , 11 ( s11 ) , 15 ( l15 ) , and 24 @xmath0 m ( l24 ) , and the prism for slitless spectroscopy in 25@xmath0 m ( np ) of a spectral resolution of @xmath13 @xmath4 20 @xcite , where the symbol in parentheses indicates the filter designation .",
    "the imaging bands cover the spectral range from 5 to 26 @xmath0 m contiguously and the s11 and l15 bands fill the gap in the wavelength coverage between the irac and mips onboard _",
    "spitzer_. the present photometric catalog is produced from the imaging data .",
    "part of the data taken in the slit - less spectroscopic mode are reported in @xcite .",
    "the data reduction and the extracted spectra with the slit - less spectroscopic mode will be given separately @xcite .",
    "we use the _ akari _ irc aot02 observation template with a special option ( using the prism instead of the n4 filter ) prepared for the lmc survey .",
    "the template is designed to take images with 2 filters in each channel at 3 dithered sky positions in a pointing observation . at each position ,",
    "both short- and long - exposure data are taken .",
    "the net integration time for a long - exposure image is typically 133 , 147 , and 147s for the nir , mir - s , and mir - l channels , respectively , and that for a short - exposure image is 14.0 , 1.75 , and 1.75s , respectively ( table [ tab : survey ] ) .",
    "the long - to - short exposure time ratio of a pointing observation is 9.5 , 28 , and 28 for the nir , mir - s , and mir - l channels , respectively , which increases the dynamic range of the observations ( see  [ sec : slmerge ] ) .",
    "the nir and mir - s channels share the same fov by means of the beam splitter , and thus n3 , np , s7 , and s11 images are taken at the same region simultaneously .",
    "l15 and l24 images of the same region are taken at a different pointing observation since their fov is located 20@xmath11 away from that of the nir / mir - s in the direction perpendicular to the _ akari _ orbit @xcite .",
    "the fov of the _ akari _ telescope moves along the ecliptic meridian in the twilight zone , which changes its direction with the earth s yearly round .",
    "therefore , the telescope can observe a given celestial position twice a year .",
    "the position of the mir - l channel relative to the nir and mir - s channels is flipped in projection on the sky at a season separated by half a year because the satellite moves in the opposite direction .",
    "taking account of the change in the projection direction , we optimize the target positions to maximize the area observed by all the three irc channels with the overlapping region of @xmath14 for each image .",
    "observations were carried out in 3 separate seasons , from 2006 may 6 to june 8 , from 2006 october 2 to december 31 , and from 2007 march 24 to july 2 .",
    "over 600 pointing observations were devoted to this project , yielding imaging and spectroscopic maps of about a 10 deg@xmath1 area of the main part of the lmc .",
    "figure  [ fig : surveyregion ] shows the area where the _ akari _ survey was carried out together with the areas of other surveys .",
    "standard procedures for the reduction of imaging data obtained with infrared arrays , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , and image co - addition , are performed in the irc data reduction toolkit version 20110304 @xcite .",
    "since the basic data reduction is carried out in the standard tool kit with the default options , we briefly summarize the procedures below .    1 .",
    "firstly the detector non - linearity is corrected for in each exposure image .",
    "deviations from the ideal linear response are estimated to be smaller than 5% at 12000 , 20000 , and 20000 adu for nir , mir - s , and mir - l , respectively , which roughly correspond to the saturation levels of 0.26 , 1.9 , 1.8 , 2.5 , and 22jy for the short - exposure data at n3 , s7 , s11 , l15 , and l24 , respectively ( see also table  [ tab : survey ] ) .",
    "the dark image is subtracted from each image .",
    "we use the dark data taken at the beginning of the pointing observation sequence ( `` pre - dark '' ) for the mir - s and mir - l long - exposure images by averaging 3 long - exposure data ( `` self - dark '' ) .",
    "for all the short - exposure and nir long - exposure images , we use the `` super - dark '' images , which are created by averaging more than 70 `` pre - dark '' images in the lmc observations and are provided as the default dark data in the irc toolkit . to correct for the possible time variation between the `` super - dark '' and the dark image at the time of observation ,",
    "the signal level of the `` super - dark '' image is scaled to that of the observed image at the slit mask region before the dark subtraction , assuming that the dark image pattern does not change with time .",
    "3 .   signals due to high - energy ionizing particle hits ( hereafter cosmic - rays ) are removed with the task cosmicrays in iraf .",
    "remaining faint comic - ray events are removed by median - average in step  [ item : combination ] .",
    "each image is divided by the flat - field image to correct for the the pixel - to - pixel variation in the sensitivity over the arrays .",
    "we employ the `` super flat - field '' images created from images near the north ecliptic pole , where the smooth zodiacal emission dominates .",
    "we use the mir - l flat data , in which the effect of the artifacts by internal reflections is corrected @xcite .",
    "the aspect ratio of each image is adjusted to 1 to 1 by resampling the image .",
    "after the adjustment , the deviation from an ideal grid square is 0.20.3 pixel in the nir and mir - s images . in the mir - l images ,",
    "the deviation becomes @xmath41 pixel at the edge of the detector .",
    "the final pixel scale of the rescaled images is 1@xmath3446 , 2@xmath3340 and 2@xmath3384 for the nir , mir - s , and mir - l images , respectively .",
    "[ item : combination ] images taken at dithered positions are spatially aligned and co - added by taking their median to eliminate any array anomalies , such as bad , dead , or hot pixels , and remaining cosmic - ray events .",
    "images are taken at least at 3 different positions in a pointing observation in the observation template aot02 .",
    "we perform source detection with the iraf / daofind and photometry with the iraf / daophot package @xcite on co - added images .",
    "we develop a procedure for the photometry with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting , which is similar to that used by the _",
    "glimpse team @xcite .",
    "the procedure of the source detection and photometry involves the following steps :    1 .",
    "[ item : daofind ] daofind is used to extract point - like sources whose fluxes are more than 2@xmath2 above the background .",
    "the extracted sources include those slightly extended compared to the psf .",
    "[ item : apphot ] the aperture photometry is performed on the extracted sources with an aperture radius of 10.0 pixels for n3 images , and of 3.0 pixels for other band images using the phot task in iraf . the radius of 10.0 pix at n3 is the same as the one used for the absolute flux calibration @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not apply aperture corrections for the photometry at n3 .",
    "for the mir band images , we adopt a smaller aperture than that used in the calibration ( 7.5 pix ) because of the large background emission in the lmc at the mir and thus the aperture correction is needed ( see step  [ item : apcor ] ) .",
    "the inner radius of the sky annulus is set as the same as the aperture radius and the width of the sky annulus is set as 5.0 pixels .",
    "[ item : pselect ] bright but unsaturated sources without any other sources within 7 pixels are selected from the results of step [ item : apphot ] to construct the psf .",
    "at least 8 of such `` good '' sources are selected in the n3 , s7 , and s11 images , and 5 in the l15 and l24 images .",
    "the `` good '' sources selected in step [ item : pselect ] are used to construct a model psf for each n3 image since the psf in the n3 images notably varies from pointing to pointing possibly due to jitters in the satellite pointing .",
    "we use the psf task in daophot to choose the best fitting function by trying several different types of fitting functions in each image .",
    "+ for the s7 , s11 , l15 , and l24 images , we use the common psfs constructed in advance for each band , instead of constructing them from each image since the effect of the jitter in the satellite pointing is negligible compared to the size of the psfs .",
    "the common psfs are constructed from about 10 `` good '' sources , which are selected from the images taken with the lmc survey and the observations of 47 tuc @xcite ; sources free from diffuse emission are carefully chosen by eyes . to construct the common psfs , the `` moffat25 '' , `` lorentz '' , `` moffat15 '' , and `` gauss '' models are applied at s7 , s11 , l15 , and l24 , respectively . 5 .",
    "the psf - fitting photometry is performed for the extracted sources in step [ item : apphot ] using allstar in daophot in an iterative manner .",
    "after the first allstar procedure is applied for the extracted sources , the sources for which photometry has been carried out are removed from the output image of allstar . then the allstar is applied again for the remaining sources .",
    "we repeat the allstar procedure 3 times to have photometry for all the extracted sources .",
    "this is a procedure similar to the one adopted by the glimpse team .",
    "[ item : apcor ] the aperture correction is applied to the psf - fitting results .",
    "the aperture correction factors and the psfs of each band are assumed to be the same among the images .",
    "the correction factor is estimated from the median of the differences between the results of the aperture photometry with an aperture of 7.5 and 3.0 pixels applied to all the sources used to construct the `` common '' psfs since the absolute calibration was carried out with the aperture photometry with the 7.5 pixel radius for the mir - s and mir - l images @xcite .",
    "we compare the results of the aperture photometry with those of the psf - fitting photometry . for the aperture photometry , only steps [ item : daofind ] , [ item : apphot ] and [ item : apcor ] above",
    "are performed .",
    "the resultant instrumental signals are converted into physical units using the irc flux conversion factors @xcite . then the calibrated flux densities are converted into magnitudes of the irc - vega system using the zero - magnitude flux densities tabulated in table [ tab : survey ] .",
    "the differences between the instrumental and the calibrated magnitudes are constants .",
    "the zero - magnitude flux densities are estimated for the short- and long - exposure images in each band using the relative spectral response in @xcite .",
    "the irc flux is calibrated against the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the color correction factors for objects with different seds are tabulated in @xcite . the photometric uncertainty includesthe read - out noises , and the errors in the aperture correction factors and the adu - to - jy conversion factors .",
    "the values of the read - out noises and the errors of the adu - to - jy conversion factors are taken from @xcite .      the attitude control system of the _ akari _ satellite has an absolute position accuracy no better than 5@xmath17 ( the requirement was 30@xmath17 ) and thus the astrometric calibration using other catalogs is necessary to improve the position information of the images .",
    "we calculate the coordinate transformation matrix that relates the image pixel coordinates to the sky coordinates by matching the detected point sources in the n3 images with the two micron all sky survey point source catalog ( 2mass - psc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and those in the mir - s and mir - l images with the @xmath18 sage lmc point source catalog version 3.1(sage - psc ; @xcite ) .",
    "sources detected in the mir - s images are matched with the irac [ 8.0 ] sources , and those detected in the mir - l images are with the mips [ 24 ] sources , respectively , where the numbers bracketed by [ ] designate the band of the sage catalog ; for instance , [ 3.6 ] indicates the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m band .",
    "the procedure is summarized in the following .    1 .",
    "the equatorial coordinates ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) of the 2mass / sage sources in each field are converted to ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) in the world coordinate system ( wcs ) .",
    "bright sources in each long - exposure image are extracted .",
    "a triangle matching between the 2mass / sage sources in the wcs ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and the sources in the pixel coordinates ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) in _ akari _ images is performed with the task xyxymatch in iraf .",
    "[ item : calmatrix ] the transformation matrix is calculated using the pixel coordinates ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and the equatorial coordinates ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) of the matched catalog sources with ccmap in iraf . the second , third , and fourth orders of polynomials are examined , and then the one with the smallest residuals is adopted .",
    "we use at least 5 sources that match with the catalogued sources for the calculation . for one s11 , 5 l15 , and 74 l24 images , automatic",
    "matching with the sage catalog is unsuccessful due to the small number of the sources in the images . in such cases , we match the detected point sources with the sage - psc by eye .",
    "we use only 4 sources for the manual matching and thus the positional accuracy in these images could be worse than those in others .",
    "point source matching does not always work for short - exposure images due to the paucity of detected point sources . for 32 s7 and 150 s11 short - exposure images ,",
    "we could not obtain a sufficient number of sources and the same matrix calculated for the corresponding long - exposure image is applied .",
    "the catalog used as the position reference ( 2mass - psc or sage - psc ) and the method ( e.g. , by eye ) used for the matching are indicated by the flags for each source ( see  [ sec : catalog ] ) .    as described above",
    ", the astrometric reference of the present catalog is the 2mass - psc and sage - psc .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of the 2mass - psc are based on the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) , and so is the sage - psc via the 2mass - psc .",
    "hence , the equatorial coordinates of the present catalog indirectly refer to the icrs .",
    "each image has overlapping regions of @xmath27 in its contiguous images .",
    "duplicate sources in the overlapping regions are merged together with the criterion of the spatial proximity of @xmath28 @xmath29 3@xmath30 .",
    "the flux density of the one with a better signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is adopted and the other(s ) is discarded . the number of the duplicate sources for each source in each band is denoted by the corresponding code ( see  [ sec : catalog ] ) .",
    "note that in most cases the overlapping regions were observed in close pointing opportunities , but in some cases , they were observed in a different season . for a variable source , therefore , the present catalog gives the flux density at a brighter phase .",
    "the above analysis produces 4 sets of the result of photometry for a source ; 2 photometry methods ( aperture or psf - fitting ) and 2 exposure time data ( short or long ) . taking account of the errors estimated from the 2 photometry methods , we adopt the results of the psf - fitting photometry for the long - exposure data for all the 5 band images . for the short - exposure data , we adopt the results of the psf - fitting photometry for the n3 images and those of the aperture photometry for the s7 and s11 images because reliable psfs can not be created for the s7 and s11 .",

    "the 90% completeness limits with the `` medium '' level are comparable to those with the `` blank '' level and those with the `` high '' level are by @xmath43 mag shallower than those with the other two .",

    "[ sec : catalog ] , we construct two kinds of catalog : the archive , which includes all the detected sources , and the catalog , which includes sources that have a counterpart(s ) in the closest band of the sage - psc",

    "these facts suggest that the archive sources are real , but that they are slightly extended for the beam of _ spitzer _ and thus are not included in the sage - psc as a true point source .",
    "figure  [ fig : limmag ] indicates that the archive sources excluded in the sage catalog have larger flux uncertainties than those in the catalog except for n3 .",
    "the larger uncertainties may be attributable to the nebulosity with which the sources are associated as suggested by the larger sharpness .",
    "the associated nebulosity is appreciably seen in the mir and increases the background fluctuation .",
    "the imperfect match with the psf for slightly extended sources could also increase the uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : matsage ] shows the distributions of the difference between the n3 , s7 , and l24 magnitudes and the [ 3.6 ] , [ 8.0 ] , and [ 24 ] in the sage - psc for the catalog sources . whereas systematic differences are present , which can be attributed to the difference in the relative spectral responses , all the bands show fairly linear correlations , confirming the consistency in the photometric results between the two datasets .",
    "in this section , we discuss the following properties of the sources in the present catalog : ( 1 ) luminosity functions ( lfs ) , ( 2 ) a color - color diagram ( ccd ) , and ( 3 ) a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .      the lfs for the 5 bands are shown in figure [ fig : lf ] .",
