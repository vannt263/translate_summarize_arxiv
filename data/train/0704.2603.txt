    "the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor , @xmath3 @xmath4(kkms@xmath5)@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the column density of molecular hydrogen ( in @xmath4 ) and @xmath7 is the velocity - integrated intensity of the co @xmath8 rotational line ( in kkms@xmath5 ) , is widely used to estimate cloud masses within the galaxy and in external galaxies .",
    "however , as demonstrated in a previous study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , the value of @xmath9 is highly sensitive to the local physical conditions , and may vary considerably even within the galaxy .",
    "the appropriate value to use in external galaxies has not so far received theoretical attention .",
    "observationally , studies of external galaxies have inferred values of @xmath9 using a variety of techniques , including virial mass estimates when individual clouds can be resolved @xcite , dust continuum observations coupled with some assumptions regarding the gas - to - dust mass ratio @xcite and the use of neutral carbon emission as a tracer when its abundance can be determined @xcite .",
    "such studies confirm the variable nature of @xmath9 , which is seen to differ from galaxy to galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ability to resolve molecular emission from individual clouds within nearby galaxies through interferometric techniques has created new opportunities for studying the interstellar medium in different environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , many properties still depend critically on the masses derived for these clouds .",
    "the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor therefore has an increasingly important role to play in advancing our understanding of the properties of interstellar gas in external galaxies .",
    "atomic carbon emission is now also routinely observed in external galaxies and has been proposed as an alternative tracer of molecular mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a c - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor of the form @xmath10 @xmath4(kkms@xmath5)@xmath5 , where @xmath11 is the velocity - integrated intensity of the [ ] 609  fine structure line ( in kkms@xmath5 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine theoretically from fundamental arguments ( as described in ) the appropriate values of @xmath9 and @xmath12 to use for each of several distinct galaxy types in which the physical conditions are significantly different from each other .",
    "we select a sample of nearby galaxies that are representative of the various commonly observed morphological types and determine the physical properties that best describe the neutral interstellar gas within them by fitting observed line intensity ratios for a range of far - infrared ( fir ) and submillimetre diagnostic lines . using the methods of , we then calculate @xmath9 for various rotational transitions of the co molecule and @xmath12 for the 609  fine structure transition of atomic carbon for each of the galaxies selected , taking the physical parameters from the best fitting model in each case .    in section  [ galaxysample ]",
    "we discuss the sample of galaxies we have selected to study and introduce them individually .",
    "section  [ fitting ] describes our fitting procedure to determine appropriate physical parameters for the interstellar medium ( ism ) in each of our sample galaxies .",
    "we present the best fit model for each galaxy in section  [ bestfitmodels ] and discuss the derived physical parameters and the quality of the fits .",
    "in section  [ conversionfactors ] we use these models to compute suitable co - to - h@xmath0 and c - to - h@xmath0 conversion factors for each galaxy type considered and we summarize our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath13determined for the best fit model obtained for ngc6946 in this work ( see section  [ bestfitmodels ] ) .",
    "@xmath14model values calculated for the physical parameters of @xcite .",
    "the conversion factors listed in table  [ xfactors ] provide a useful reference for observers , presenting ` standard ' conversion factors that are more appropriate to these diverse environments than the canonical value derived for the milky way . by obtaining data in multiple transitions of co and",
    ", several conversion factors can be used to provide better constraints on the estimated molecular mass within a region .",
    "we have determined appropriate physical parameters that represent the average conditions within four key extragalactic environments ; the interstellar gas within the spiral arms and nuclei of normal late - type spiral galaxies ( modelled on the central region of m51 ) , the starburst nuclei of spiral galaxies and more extreme starburst environments ( including the centre of the barred spiral galaxy ngc6946 and the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 ) and the low metallicities and high uv fields typical of dwarf irregular galaxies ( in this case , modelled on region n27 of the small magellanic cloud ) . best fit models for these environments have been determined by fitting observed line intensity ratios in the selected regions for a range of fir and sub - mm diagnostic lines .",
    "the resulting models have been used to derive appropriate co - to - h@xmath0 and c - to - h@xmath0 conversion factors that will allow more reliable molecular mass estimates to be inferred from observations of co rotational lines and the [ ] 609  fine structure line in a wide variety of extragalactic environments .",
    "these conversion factors are listed in table  [ xfactors ] .",
    "conversion factors are presented for a range of co transitions , enabling estimates of the molecular mass to be further constrained using several line intensities simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , different emission lines may probe specific components within the interstellar medium , e.g.  dense and hot gas in the case of the high @xmath15 co transitions .",
    "uncertainties in the best fit physical parameters have been determined for each galaxy , and these are now used to examine the corresponding variation in the derived co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factors .",
    "the uncertainties in the best fit gas density and fuv flux are listed in table  [ bestfitparameters ] and we assume a factor of 2 uncertainty in the metallicity .",
    "uncertainties in the other physical parameters are not considered here .",
    "@xmath9 decreases with increasing density , as the co emission becomes stronger nearer the cloud edge , whilst it generally increases with fuv flux , as co is more readily photodissociated ; @xmath9 depends strongly on metallicity , decreasing as metallicity increases and co emission becomes stronger .",
    "the sensitivity of the c - to - h@xmath0 conversion factors to these uncertainties is not discussed here , but is found to be very similar .    for the centre of m51",
    ", the uncertainty in the gas density typically causes @xmath9 to vary by less than a factor of 2 , with the exception of the higher co transitions ( @xmath16 and above ) , for which variation by over a factor of 3 is found .",
    "uncertainty in the best fit fuv flux has little or no influence on @xmath9 , with at most a factor of 2 variation in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 conversion factors .",
    "the assumed uncertainty of a factor of 2 in metallicity has the greatest impact on the derived values of @xmath9 , causing them to vary by up to a factor of 4 .",
    "the higher transition lines of co are more sensitive to variations in the gas density and temperature , since their critical densities for excitation are higher and greater temperatures are required to excite them . for the best fit parameters for ngc6946 , the uncertainty in the density leads to variations in @xmath9 of up to a factor of 2 , though without the increase in the higher transition lines that was found for m51 .",
    "the slightly larger fuv flux uncertainty leads to a marginal increase in the degree of variation of @xmath9 , though it is still typically no more than a factor of 2 .",
    "variation in the metallicity causes up to a factor of 4 variation in @xmath9 .",
    "relatively tight constraints on the best fit density and radiation field strength for m82 mean that the resulting variation in @xmath9 is also small and always less than a factor of 2 . assuming that the metallicity is again uncertain by a factor of 2 , larger variations in @xmath9 are produced than were seen in m51 or ngc6946 ( @xmath9 varies by a factor of 34 in the lower transitions and by over 6 in the @xmath18 and @xmath17 transitions ) .",
    "the larger variation with metallicity seen in m82 is probably due to the elevated fuv flux , which , combined with the change in shielding that accompanies the change in metallicity , can enhance the photodissociation of co.    the best fit physical parameters determined for the smc suffer the greatest uncertainties and this is reflected in the degree of variation in the conversion factors .",
    "the low metallicity adopted for this galaxy ( @xmath19 ) also causes @xmath9 to be more sensitive to change in the physical parameters .",
    "therefore , the large uncertainty in the density ( up to a factor of 5 ) leads to variations in @xmath9 that range from a factor of 4 for the @xmath8 transition to over a factor of 35 for the @xmath17 transition line .",
    "the weak dependence of the co - to - h@xmath0 conversion factor on the fuv flux means that the uncertainty in this parameter produces only a factor of 2 variation in @xmath9 .",
    "uncertainty in the metallicity causes @xmath9 to vary by a factor of 45 .",
    "overall , the uncertainty in the best fit density and radiation field strength for each galaxy typically cause the corresponding co - to - h@xmath0 and c - to - h@xmath0 conversion factors to vary by no more than a factor of 23 , whilst the adopted uncertainty in the metallicity has a stronger influence , producing a factor of 4 or higher variation in @xmath9 and @xmath12 .",
    "conversion factors for the higher transition lines of co are found to be more susceptible to the uncertainties in the physical parameters .",
    "the conversion factors derived for the smc suffer the greatest level of uncertainty , a consequence of the poorer quality of fit that was obtained for this galaxy .",
    "the essence of the x - factor method is that a single measurement of co intensity  representing a wide range of physical conditions in a region of space  can be used to estimate the mass of gas in that region .",
    "our method predicts the most probable values for the physical conditions within the region considered , and hence the most probable value of the co ( or other ) emission .",
    "we believe , therefore , that our method is consistent with the x - factor method and that our derived conversion factor values are appropriate to use , rather than other values from the possible range of @xmath9 obtained as above .    in future work , the range of physical parameters over which each specified conversion factor remains valid will be examined in more detail , providing limits on their applicability .",
    "the emission lines of other species might also prove to be better tracers of the molecular mass under certain conditions ( e.g.  hcn for dense gas ) ; this prospect will also be considered in a future study .",
    "it is hoped that , taken together , these conversion factors will provide a firm basis upon which increasingly reliable molecular mass estimates can be made .",
