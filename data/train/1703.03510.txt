    "it plays an essential role in several phenomena in physics , such as the energy production in stars , nucleosynthesis , and a synthesis of superheavy elements @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the simplest approach to estimate fusion cross sections is to use the potential model , in which one assumes a spherical potential between the two colliding nuclei . in this model ,",
    "the colliding nuclei are assumed to be spherical and inert , and fusion is simulated as an absorption of flux inside the coulomb barrier .",
    "fusion cross sections are then obtained by adding the penetrability of the coulomb barrier for each partial wave .    approximating the coulomb barrier with a parabolic function",
    ", wong has derived a compact expression for fusion cross sections @xcite .",
    "the resultant formula , referred to as the wong formula , has been widely used in the investigation of heavy - ion fusion reactions .",
    "for instance , the formula has been used to provide reference cross sections in order to discuss channel coupling effects .",
    "the formula has also been used recently in order to analyze fusion barrier distributions using a method based on the bayesian spectral deconvolution @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the correction to the wong formula has been discussed in order to discuss the oscillatory behavior of fusion cross sections in symmetric and nearly symmetric light systems @xcite .",
    "the original wong formula tends to overestimate fusion cross sections in light systems . in order to cure this problem ,",
    "the wong formula has been generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite by introducing an energy dependence to the barrier parameters .",
    "even though the generalized wong formula has been shown to reproduce well the exact results , it has yet to clarify from which system and from which energy the generalization becomes important .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a systematic study and address this question . to this end , we compare fusion cross sections obtained with the wong formula with the exact results from light to heavy systems .",
    "we shall discuss the deviation from the exact cross sections as a function of the mass number of the target nucleus for a fixed projectile nucleus .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will briefly present the formulation of the potential model for fusion reactions , and introduce the wong formula . in sec .",
    "iii , we will apply the wong formula to a multitude of systems and discuss its applicability .",

    "this equation is solved with boundary conditions of @xcite @xmath6 here , @xmath7 are the coulomb wave functions , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",

    ", wong has first approximated the coulomb barrier with an inverted parabola , that is , @xmath18 in the original wong formula , the barrier position , @xmath19 , and the barrier curvature , @xmath20 , are assumed to be independent of @xmath4 and are evaluated for the @xmath21-wave .",
    "the effective potential for the @xmath4-th partial wave then reads , @xmath22 using the hill - wheeler formula @xcite , the penetration probability , @xmath23 , is calculated as , @xmath24}. \\label{penetrability } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] replacing the summation in eq .",

    "cc    cc    figure  [ light - to - heavy ] compares fusion cross sections with the wong formula ( the dashed line ) to those obtained by numerically solving the schrdinger equation ( the solid line ) , for the @xmath31c+@xmath29o , @xmath32ca , @xmath33sm and @xmath34u systems . to this end , we employ the akyz - winther potential @xcite for a nuclear part of the nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the wong formula tends to overestimate fusion cross sections , although the agreement with the exact results considerably improves as the mass number of the target increases @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "in order to discuss more systematically the performance of the wong formula , in this section we vary the target nucleus from c to u for a fixed projectile nucleus . for each target",

    "figure  [ sigma - a ] shows the calculated results as a function of the mass number @xmath42 of the target nucleus .",
    "we again use the akyz - winther potential for each system .",
    "one can see that the deviation , @xmath43 , decreases as a function of the mass number of the target nucleus . for the @xmath31c , @xmath29o , and @xmath37ne projectiles ,",
    "the deviation almost saturates at around @xmath44 , that corresponds to @xmath45 20 . on the other hand , for the lighter projectiles ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath43 is much slower and especially for @xmath35he the deviation is relatively large even for a heavy target .",
    "this implies that the original wong formula is not applicable for light projectiles such as @xmath35he , and the generalization proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is important . for heavier projectile nuclei , as we have noted ,",

    "( [ delta ] ) for @xmath36li induced fusion reactions as a function of the incident energy relative to the barrier height for each system .",
    "the target nucleus is @xmath34u , @xmath47sm , @xmath48ge , @xmath32ar , @xmath49si , @xmath37ne , and @xmath29o in the decreasing order at @xmath50 = 4 mev . ]    in order to see the energy dependence of the deviation of the wong formula , we next define a quantity @xmath51 @xmath52 which indicates the degree of deviation at a given energy , @xmath5 .",
    "[ delta - e ] shows the quantity @xmath51 for the @xmath36li projectile on several target nuclei from o to u , as a function of energy relative to the barrier height for each system . except for the energy region just above the barrier , @xmath51 is negative , that is , the wong formula overestimates fusion cross sections .",
    "furthermore , the slope of @xmath51 is much steeper for the lighter targets compared to that for the heavier targets , that is consistent with the finding shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma - a ] .    at energies slightly above the barrier ,",
    "the deviation @xmath51 is positive , thus the wong formula underestimates fusion cross sections .",
    "this is due to the fact that the parabolic approximation underestimates the width of the coulomb barrier because of the asymmetric shape of the coulomb barrier caused by the long range coulomb interaction ( see fig .",
    "15 in ref .",
    "this leads to a smaller tunneling probability at energies above the barrier , thus reducing fusion cross sections . at higher energies , on the other hand ,",
    "the tunneling is not important , and the @xmath4-dependence of the barrier position @xmath53 comes into a play to reduce fusion cross sections from the approximate cross sections @xcite .     the critical energy , @xmath54 , at which the deviation defined by eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) exceeds 5% , measured relative to the barrier height for each system as a function of the mass number of the target nucleus . ]",
    "let us next define the critical energy @xmath54 as the energy at which the absolute value of the deviation , @xmath55 , exceeds a certain value .",
    "we arbitrarily choose it to be 5% .",
    "[ ecrit - eb ] shows the critical energy with respect to the barrier height for each system as a function of the mass number of the target nucleus . for the projectile ,",
    "we choose @xmath36li , @xmath31c , @xmath29o , and @xmath37ne .",
    "the figure shows that for light systems the critical energy is reached already at an energy slightly above the barrier , while one has to go up to a higher energy for heavy systems .",
    "for instance , the critical energy is 3.02 mev higher than the barrier for the @xmath31c+@xmath29o system whereas it is 30.37 mev higher than the barrier for the @xmath31o+@xmath34u system .",
    "we notice that this is consistent with what we have shown in fig .",
    "[ light - to - heavy ] .",
    "we have carried out a comparative study on the applicability of the wong formula for single - channel fusion cross sections . to this end , we have compared the fusion cross sections obtained with the wong formula to the exact results from light to heavy systems .",
    "we have shown that the wong formula leads to reasonable results when the target nucleus is in the @xmath46 50 region or heavier for the projectiles of @xmath36li , @xmath31c , @xmath29o , and @xmath37ne , while the deviation is still large even for a heavy target in systems with @xmath35he projectile .",
    "we have also investigated the energy dependence of the deviation , and have shown that the deviation quickly becomes large for light systems as the energy increases while a high incident energy is required for heavy systems before the deviation becomes significant .",
    "these conclusions indicate that a care must be taken in using the wong formula in light systems , for which the generalization discussed in ref .",
