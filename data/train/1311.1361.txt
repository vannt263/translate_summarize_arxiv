    "the rx@xmath0-type ( r = rare earth elements , x= in , sn , tl , pb ) intermetallic compounds , which crystallize in the simple cubic cu@xmath0au structure , have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations because of their diverse properties",
    ". many of these compounds are superconductors .",
    "lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 are particularly significant as they are found to have relatively high superconducting transition temperatures , t@xmath5 . for lasn@xmath0 ,",
    "t@xmath6 k , @xcite and for ysn@xmath0 t@xmath7 k , @xcite whereas lapb@xmath0 , latl@xmath0 and lain@xmath0 have lower t@xmath5 s of 4.05 k , 1.51 k and 0.71 k , respectively .",
    "@xcite some of the rx@xmath0 compounds , such as prsn@xmath0 and ndsn@xmath0 , are found to order antiferromagnetically at t@xmath8= 8.6 k and 4.5 k , respectively,@xcite and cesn@xmath0 has been categorized as a dense kondo compound exhibiting valence fluctuations.@xcite it is interesting to compare the properties of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 to reveal to which extent the similar valence electron configurations of y and la influence the details of the electronic structure .",
    "@xcite the lax@xmath0 ( x= sn , in , tl , pb ) series and their alloys show an oscillatory dependence in their bulk properties ( superconducting transition temperature , magnetic susceptibility , thermoelectric power factor ) as a function of average valence - electron number.@xcite at first , this behavior was interpreted in a nearly - free electron model as a reflection of the fermi surface crossing the brillouin zone close to the x - point,@xcite a viewpoint later contested by grobman.@xcite the pressure dependence of the critical temperature of lasn@xmath0 is anomalous , as shown by huang et al.,@xcite which these authors expect to be driven by a fermi surface topology change .    in the present study",
    ", we calculate the fermi surface of lasn@xmath0 and indeed observe a change in topology under pressure , where a third set of electron pockets appear and a minor part of the complex second sheet transfers from a closed orbit to an open orbit region .",
    "a similar transition is not predicted for ysn@xmath0 , despite the overall similarity of their electronic structures .",
    "a number of studies are available on the band structures of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0,@xcite while less efforts have been devoted to the pressure dependence of the electronic structure , fermi surface and elastic properties for these compounds .",
    "hence we focus our attention in this paper on analysing the pressure induced fermi surface topology change in lasn@xmath0 , which might be associated with the anomalous behaviour of t@xmath5 under pressure , and present a comparative study of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 under pressure .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the method of calculation used in this study .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section iii , while section iv concludes the paper .",
    "the calculations were performed using the full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k computer code,@xcite based on density functional theory ( dft ) , @xcite which has been shown to yield reliable results for the electronic and structural properties of crystalline solids .",
    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) was included .",
    "for the exchange - correlation functional , both the local density approximation ( lda ) as proposed by ceperley and alder @xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) according to the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite parametrization was used . in order to achieve energy eigenvalue convergence , the wave functions in the interstitial region",
    "were expanded using plane waves with a cutoff of r@xmath9k@xmath10= 9 , where k@xmath10 is the plane wave cut - off , and r@xmath9 is the smallest of all atomic sphere radii .",
    "the charge density was fourier expanded up to g@xmath10=18 ( a.u.)@xmath11 .",
    "the maximum @xmath12 value for the wave function expansion inside the atomic spheres was confined to @xmath13 .",
    "convergence tests were carried out using higher g@xmath10 and r@xmath9k@xmath10 values , giving no significant changes in the calculated properties .",
    "the muffin - tin radii were chosen as 2.75 a.u .",
    "for both la and y and 2.83 a.u . for sn .",
    "the self - consistent calculations were considered to be converged when the total energy of the system was stable within 10@xmath14 ry .",
    "the birch - murnaghan equation of states @xcite was used to fit the total energy as a function of unit cell volume to obtain the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli for the investigated systems . for the fermi surfaces of rsn@xmath0 a (",
    "64 @xmath15 64 @xmath15 64 ) mesh was used to ensure accurate determination of the fermi level and smooth interpolation of the bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "the three dimensional ( 3d ) fermi surface plots were generated with the help of the xcrysden molecular structure visualization program .",
    "@xcite    the elastic constants have been calculated within the total - energy method , where the unit cell is subjected to a number of small amplitude strains along several directions .",
    "the elastic constants of solids provide links between the mechanical and dynamical properties of the crystals .",
    "in particular , they provide information on the stability and stiffness of materials .",
    "it is well known that a cubic crystal has only three independent elastic constants @xcite c@xmath16 , c@xmath17 and c@xmath18 . from these one",
    "may obtain the hill s @xcite shear modulus g@xmath19 , ( which is the arithmetic mean of the reuss@xcite and voigt@xcite approximations ) , young s modulus @xmath20 , and the poisson s ratio @xmath21 by using stardard relations .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the debye temperature may be obtained in terms of the mean sound velocity @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are planck s , boltzmann s constants , and avogadro s number , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 is the mass density , @xmath28 the molecular weight , and @xmath29 the number of atoms in the unit cell .",

    "the rsn@xmath0 compounds crystallize in the cu@xmath0au type structure with space group @xmath35 ( no .",
    "221 ) . the calculated equilibrium lattice parameters @xmath36 and zero pressure bulk modulus @xmath37 are listed in table i. the results are in good agreement with available experimental data and other calculations .",
    "it often occurs that lda underestimates and gga overestimates the equillibrium lattice constants , which is also found in the present case , where the lda value is @xmath38 % below and the gga value @xmath38 % above the experimental value .",
    "the somewhat lower bulk modulus obtained with gga reflects the larger equilibrium volume in this approximation . in the remainder of this study",
    "we report results on the basis of the lda .",
    "the calculated elastic constants ( c@xmath16 , c@xmath17 and c@xmath18 ) at ambient pressure for lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 are presented in table ii , together with quantities related to the elastic constants .",
    "the calculations were performed at the equilibrium lattice constant as calculated with the lda .",
    "the elastic constants extracted from the experimental phonon dispersion curves@xcite are listed for comparison .",
    "the theoretical values lie systematically 20 - 30 % above the experimental values , which partly is due to the too low equilibrium volume obtained in the lda .",
    "the fact that the experiments are done at room temperature , while the calculations pertain to zero temperature also contribute to this discrepancy . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no experimental determinations of the elastic constants of ysn@xmath0 have been reported . neither have any theoretical determinations been reported . from the calculated values of the elastic constants",
    ", it can be seen that they satisfy the mechanical stability criteria@xcite for a cubic crystal i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , consistent with the elastic stability of these materials .",
    "pugh @xcite has proposed a simple relationship in which the ductile / brittle properties of materials could be related empirically to their elastic constants by the ratio @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , the materials behave in a ductile manner , and brittle otherwise . from the values of @xmath42",
    "reported in table ii it emerges that both compounds are of ductile character , and that ysn@xmath0 is more ductile than lasn@xmath0 .",
    "cauchy s pressure ( @xmath44 ) is another index to determine the ductile / brittle nature of metallic compounds , where a positive value of cauchy s pressure indicates ductile nature , while a negative value indicates a brittle nature of the compounds .",
    "the calculated positive values of the cauchy s pressure reported in table ii corroborate the ductile nature of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 .",
    "the young s modulus @xmath20 also reflects the ductility",
    ". the larger the value of @xmath20 , the stiffer is the material , and as the covalent nature of the compounds increases @xmath20 also increases .",
    "another important parameter describing the ductile nature of solids is the poisson s ratio @xmath21 ( see table ii ) , which is calculated using the formula given in ref . . for ductile metallic materials @xmath21",
    "is typically around 0.33.@xcite so the ductility of these compounds is confirmed by the calculated values of @xmath21 reported in table ii .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath45 is defined as the ratio between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which becomes unity for an isotropic system . according to this definition , lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 are elastically anisotropic .",
    "the elastic constants and bulk modulus increase monotonously under compression , fulfilling the mechanical stability criteria also at higher pressures . having calculated young s modulus e , the bulk modulus b , and the shear modulus g , one may derive the debye temperature using eq .",
    "the calculated sound velocities ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath22 ) and the debye temperature ( @xmath48 ) are included in table ii .",
    "the experimental debye temperatures are almost the same for lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 , while the present calculations find the debye temperature of ysn@xmath0 substantially lower than that of lasn@xmath0 , a consequence of the smaller calculated values of the elastic constants of ysn@xmath0 .",
    "the sound velocities increase with pressure for lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 , reflecting the increase in the relevant acoustic phonon frequencies with pressure .",
    "the band structures of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 are illustrated in fig .",
    "the electronic levels are calculated along the high - symmetry directions with and without spin - orbit coupling and at the lda equilibrium volumes .",
    "the band structure of lasn@xmath0 with soc compares well with earlier work .",
    "@xcite overall , the band structures of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 are very similar , as noted by ref . , which also discussed the effect of soc .",
    "the major difference between the two compounds in the vicinity of the fermi level , e@xmath49 , occurs at the x - point , where a band crosses the @xmath50 for lasn@xmath0 , but stays below @xmath50 for ysn@xmath0 .",
    "this gives rise to a small hole pocket around the @xmath51-point in lasn@xmath0 , which does not appear for ysn@xmath0 ( and which would not be if soc is not included ) .",
    "this band contributes to the third fermi surface of ysn@xmath0 , which in lasn@xmath0 only appears under pressure .",
    "the main interesting pressure effect on the electronic structure of these compounds is the opposite movement of the valence band and the conduction band . along",
    "all high symmetry directions the valence bands move down , while an upward shift of the conduction bands under compression is seen .",
    "this is illustrated for lasn@xmath0 in fig .",
    "2 , which shows the band structure for @xmath52 and @xmath2 , where @xmath53 denotes the experimental equilibrium volume . owing to this opposite movement of bands under pressure the number of electron states in the pockets around the m - points , as well as the number of hole states around the x - points increase .",
    "the narrow bands around 1.5 - 2 ev above the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) in lasn@xmath0 are the la - @xmath3 bands",
    ". these unocupied la - @xmath3 bands overlap with the la - @xmath54 bands , with some influence on the energy band structure in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "this is illustrated with the density of states , which is shown in fig .",
    "3 , for both lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 . in both compounds ,",
    "the dominating character around the fermi level is from sn @xmath55 , with appreciable admixture of y @xmath56 or la @xmath54 .",
    "but for lasn@xmath0 the tail of the @xmath3 ( blue line ) in fig .",
    "3(a ) also crosses the fermi level .",
    "the behaviour of the total density of states at the fermi level under compression is shown in fig .",
    "4 . while the total density of states at the fermi energy , @xmath57 , decreases smoothly for ysn@xmath0 under compression",
    ", it is more irregular for lasn@xmath0 . in lasn@xmath0",
    ", @xmath57 passes through a minimum at @xmath1 ( pressure of 1 gpa according to lda ) .",
    "this behaviour of lasn@xmath0 is caused by the occurrence of the third fermi sheet under pressure , which is discussed in the next subsection .    in table",
    "iii the density of states at the fermi level is compared to the experimental value as derived from the sommerfeld coefficient . from the difference ,",
    "the average electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath58 may be estimated , assuming @xmath59 for lasn@xmath0 this reaches a value of @xmath60 , while for ysn@xmath0 a value of @xmath61 is found .",
    "note that the latter is lower than the value deduced by dugdale , ref .",
    ", because the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling in the calculation increases @xmath57 by @xmath62 % .",
    "the value obtained here for lasn@xmath0 is in good agreement with the value found by ref . .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature for lasn@xmath0 may be estimated using the mcmillan formula@xcite : @xmath63 using a typical value of @xmath64 ( ref . ) and the debye temperature of lasn@xmath0 of @xmath65 k , this leads to a calculated value of @xmath66 k , which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of @xmath67 k , given the uncertainty of the parameters of the mcmillan formula .",
    "the fermi surfaces of lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 at the experimental equilibrium volumes are shown in fig .",
    "the similarity of the band structures lead to nearly identical topology of the fermi surfaces for the two compounds .",
    "the major difference is that for lasn@xmath0 two bands cross the fermi level , whereas for ysn@xmath0 three bands cross the fermi level .",
    "the first fermi surface sheet , fig . 5(a ) and 5(c ) , is a hole pocket centered on the @xmath68 point .",
    "the second sheet , fig . 5(b ) and 5(d ) , is a very complex surface , which we discuss in detail for lasn@xmath0 below . in comparison between the two compounds ,",
    "a small hole pocket is seen around the x - point in fig .",
    "5(b ) , which is absent in fig .",
    "5(d ) , which reflects the difference in band structure at @xmath51 as discussed in the previous section . finally , the third surface of ysn@xmath0 is a small electron part close to the x - point . in fig .",
    "6 we illustrate for lasn@xmath0 the complexity of the second sheet by showing horizontal cuts through the three - dimensional fermi surface . it is to be noted that without taking into account the soc three bands would cross the fermi level even at ambient volume , and the corresponding fermi surfaces would be similar for lasn@xmath0 and ysn@xmath0 , and furthermore , for ysn@xmath0 the fermi surface would be topologically the same with and without soc .",
    "the most striking change in the fermi surface of lasn@xmath0 under pressure is the appearance of the third surface , already seen in ysn@xmath0 at ambient conditions .",
    "this appears at a compression of @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
    "7(c ) . a second",
    ", less drastic change occurs in the second fermi surface of lasn@xmath0 , where a change in topology is observed .",
    "this is most easily seen in the two - dimensional contours of fig .",
    "6(b ) , where the hole pocket around the x - point , ( the middle point of the @xmath69 face ) increases and merges with the surrounding triangular hole regions . in contrast , for @xmath70 , fig .",
    "6(a ) , this pocket is detached from the larger hole region , facilitating a small closed electron orbit .",
    "at the same time , the electron concentration around the m - point ( the midpoints of all edges of the bz ) increases under compression , which eventually leads to the connection of all electron pockets in the @xmath69 face .",
    "this happens around @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "7(b ) ) . altogether , under compression the electron concentration at m and the hole concentration at x increase simultaneously in lasn@xmath0 . in the case of ysn@xmath0 only the electron concentration at the m - point increases , while there is no hole pocket at x even at ambient volume , and therefore the fermi surface topology of ysn@xmath0 remains unchanged under ( modest ) compression .",
    "the occurrence of a third fermi surface sheet for lasn@xmath0 under pressure leads to an increase of the density of states at the fermi level , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 . for comparison the same quantity for ysn@xmath0 is also shown in the figure , and it is seen to decrease monotonously under pressure . these results for lasn@xmath0 are in accordance with the zero - pressure measurements of the superconducting transition temperature in the ( la , th)sn@xmath0 alloy system as investigated by havinga et al.@xcite these authors also speculated that their observed oscillatory behaviour of @xmath71 versus alloy composition might be due to a singular behaviour of the electronic density of states in the vicinity of the fermi level of lasn@xmath0 .",
    "huang et al .",
    "@xcite observed an irregular behaviour of t@xmath5 for lasn@xmath0 under pressure .",
    "these authors reported an initial slight increase in t@xmath5 with a maximum at a pressure around 0.8 gpa , beyond which t@xmath5 gradually decreases . within the bcs framework of superconductivity ,",
    "the change in t@xmath5 observed could reflect a change in the density of states at the fermi level . at first",
    ", this seems in accordance with the non - monotonic variation under compression of the density of states at the fermi level in lasn@xmath0 found in the present calculations .",
    "however , we find the opposite trend of an initially decreasing density of states at the fermi level , and an increase only starts for compressions below 0.94@xmath53 .",
    "several other factors of course also influence the transition temperature .",
    "the pressure dependence of t@xmath5 arising from pressure - induced abrupt changes in the fermi surface topology was theoretically analysed by makarov and baryakhtar @xcite .",
