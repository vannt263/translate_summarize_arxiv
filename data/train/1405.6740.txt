    "the aim of this paper is to define the matching measure of an infinite lattice @xmath0 and show how it can be used to analyze the behaviour of the monomer - dimer model on @xmath0 .",
    "the notion of matching measure has been recently introduced by the first and second authors , frenkel and kun in @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two ways to define it : in this paper we take the path of giving a direct , spectral definition for infinite vertex transitive lattices , using self - avoiding walks and then connect it to the monomer - dimer model via graph convergence .",
    "recall that a graph @xmath0 is _ vertex transitive _ if for any two vertices of @xmath0 there exists an automorphism of @xmath0 that brings one vertex to the other .",
    "let @xmath1 be a fixed vertex of the graph @xmath0 .",
    "a walk in @xmath0 is _ self - avoiding _ , if it touches every vertex at most once .",
    "there is a natural graph structure on the set of finite self - avoiding walks starting at @xmath1 : we connect two walks if one is a one step extension of the other .",
    "the resulting graph is an infinite rooted tree , called the _ tree of self - avoiding walks _ _ of _ @xmath0 _ _  starting at _ _ @xmath1 .",

    "the _ matching measure _",
    "@xmath2 is the spectral measure of the tree of self - avoiding walks of @xmath0 starting at @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is a vertex of @xmath0 .    by vertex transitivity ,",
    "the definition is independent of @xmath1 . for a more general definition , also covering lattices that are not vertex transitive , see section  [ measure ] .    to make sense of why we call this the matching measure , we need the notion of benjamini  schramm convergence .",
    "let @xmath3 be a sequence of finite graphs .",
    "we say that @xmath3 benjamini  schramm converges to @xmath0 , if for every @xmath4 , the probability that the @xmath5-ball centered at a uniform random vertex of @xmath3 is isomorphic to the @xmath5-ball in @xmath0 tends to @xmath6 as @xmath7 tends to infinity .",
    "that is , if by randomly sampling @xmath3  and looking at a bounded distance , we can not distinguish it from @xmath0 in probability .",
    "all euclidean lattices @xmath0 can be approximated this way by taking sequences of boxes with side lengths tending to infinity , by bigger and bigger balls in @xmath0 in its graph metric , or by suitable tori .",
    "when @xmath0 is a bethe lattice ( a @xmath8-regular tree ) , finite subgraphs never converge to @xmath0 and the usual way is to set @xmath3 to be @xmath8-regular finite graphs where the minimal cycle length tends to infinity .    for a finite graph @xmath9 and @xmath10 let @xmath11 be the number of monomer - dimer arrangements with @xmath12 dimers ( matchings of @xmath9 using @xmath12 edges ) .",
    "let @xmath13 .",
    "let the _ matching polynomial _ @xmath14 and let @xmath15 , the _ matching measure of _ @xmath9 be the uniform distribution on the roots of @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is just a reparametrization of the monomer - dimer partition function .",
    "the matching polynomial has the advantage over the partition function that its roots are bounded in terms of the maximal degree of @xmath9 .    using previous work of godsil @xcite",
    "we show that @xmath2 can be obtained as the thermodynamical limit of the @xmath17 .",
    "[ konv]let @xmath0 be an infinite vertex transitive lattice and let @xmath3 benjamini  schramm converge to @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath17 weakly converges to @xmath2 and @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "so in this sense , the matching measure can be thought of as the ` root distribution of the partition function for the infinite monomer - dimer model ' , transformed by a fixed reparametrization .",
    "it turns out that the matching measure can be effectively used as a substitute for the mayer series .",
    "an important advantage over it is that certain natural functions can be integrated along this measure even in those cases when the corresponding series do not converge .",
    "we demonstrate this advantage by giving new , strong estimates on the free energies of monomer - dimer models for euclidean lattices , by expressing them directly from the matching measures .",
    "the computation of monomer - dimer and dimer free energies has a long history .",
    "the precise value is known only in very special cases .",
    "such an exceptional case is the fisher - kasteleyn - temperley formula @xcite for the dimer model on @xmath20 .",
    "there is no such exact result for monomer - dimer models .",
    "the first approach for getting estimates was the use of the transfer matrix method .",
    "hammersley @xcite , hammersley and menon @xcite and baxter @xcite obtained the first ( non - rigorous ) estimates for the free energy .",
    "then friedland and peled @xcite proved the rigorous estimates @xmath21 for @xmath22 and the range @xmath23 $ ] for @xmath24 . here",
    "the upper bounds were obtained by the transfer matrix method , while the lower bounds relied on the friedland - tverberg inequality .",
    "the lower bound in the friedland - peled paper was subsequently improved by newer and newer results ( see e.g. @xcite ) on friedland s asymptotic matching conjecture which was finally proved by l. gurvits @xcite . meanwhile , a non - rigorous estimate @xmath25 $ ] was obtained via matrix permanents @xcite .",
    "the most significant improvement was obtained recently by d. gamarnik and d. katz @xcite via their new method which they called sequential cavity method .",
    "they obtained the range @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "here we only highlight one computational result .",
    "more data can be found in section  [ entropy - function ] , in particular , in table 1 .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the monomer - dimer free energy of the lattice @xmath0 , and let @xmath28 denote the @xmath8-dimensional hyper - simple cubic lattice .",
    "we have @xmath29@xmath30 @xmath31 the bounds on the error terms are rigorous .",
    "our method allows to get efficient estimates on arbitrary lattices .",
    "the computational bottleneck is the tree of self - avoiding walks , which is famous to withstand theoretical interrogation .",
    "it is natural to ask what are the actual matching measures for the various lattices . in the case of a bethe lattice @xmath32",
    ", the tree of self - avoiding walks again equals @xmath32 , so the matching measure of @xmath32 coincides with its spectral measure .",
    "this explicit measure , called kesten - mckay measure has density @xmath33    we were not able to find such explicit formulae for any of the euclidean lattices .",
    "however , using theorem  [ konv ] one can show that the matching measures of hypersimple cubic lattices admit no atoms .",
    "[ atomless]the matching measures @xmath34 have no atoms .    in section  [ density ]",
    "we prove a more general result which also shows that for instance , the matching measure of the hexagonal lattice has no atoms .",
    "for some images on the matching measures of @xmath20 and @xmath35 see section  [ density ] .",
    "we expect that the matching measures of all hypersimple cubic lattices are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesque measure .",
    "we also expect that the radius of support of the matching measure ( that is , the spectral radius of the tree of self - avoiding walks ) carries further interesting information about the lattice .",
