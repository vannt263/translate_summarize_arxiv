    "* combining the fluorescence signal and center - of - mass motion together provides an insight into the loss mechanism of levitated nanodiamonds in vacuum . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]e , a levitated nanodiamond is lost after being held at 31  torr for 17 minutes .",
    "the total count of the fluorescence signal first decreases gradually and then drops rapidly within the last 60 seconds before the nanodiamond is lost ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]e ) . based on the fluorescence signal alone",
    ", one might conclude that the nanodiamond is gradually burned in residual air in the vacuum chamber .",
    "however , the viscous damping factor @xmath37 which is related to the particle size ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : gamma0 ] ) is fairly constant at 31  torr .",
    "so the size of the nanodiamond does not change significantly before it is lost .",
    "this is consistent with the internal temperature of the nanodiamond measured by the esr which will be discussed later . for the nanodiamond shown in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]e ) , its internal temperature is about 450  k ( 177 @xmath41c ) . according to a former investigation , the size reduction speed of nanodiamond due to air oxidization at atmospheric pressure is about 1 nm / hour at 770 k. at 450  k , the size reduction of a nanodiamond should be negligible , especially because the oxygen pressure is low in low vacuum .",
    "so the loss of a trapped nanodiamond is unlikely due to oxidization , instead it might relate to the brownian motion due to the rising temperature of the nanodiamond .",
    "when the temperature of the nanodiamond increases , the effective temperature of surrounding gases increases @xcite .",
    "since the mean squared displacement of the brownian motion , @xmath42 , is proportional to effective temperature of surrounding gases , the particle will explore a larger volume and be more likely to escape from the trapping region .",
    "the loss of levitated nanodiamond in an optically trap is similar to kramer s escape rate problem describing the escape rate of a particle from a potential barrier , @xmath43 @xcite , here @xmath35 is the viscous damping factor , @xmath44 is the potential barrier , @xmath45 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath46 is the nanodiamond temperature .",
    "the escape rate increases with increasing temperature of the particle .",
    "a larger vibration amplitude can lead to a decrease of the fluorescence signal when nanodiamond randomly walks away the trapping region ( overlapping with the focus of the visible imaging system ) .",
    "though , more studies are required to further clarify the loss mechanism .",
    "* center - of - mass motion calibration*. when the nanodiamond is at the thermal equilibrium , the power spectra density ( psd ) of nanodiamond cmm is given by @xcite @xmath47 here @xmath48 , @xmath46 is the air temperature , @xmath49 is the nanodiamond mass , @xmath35 is the viscous damping factor due to the air , @xmath50 is the trapping frequency in the @xmath32-axis , and @xmath51 is the observation frequency . fitting the cmm power spectral density data in fig .

    "the trapping frequency depends on the laser trapping power .",
    "since the refractive index of air is 1.0027 , similar to vacuum , the trapping potential in air should be essentially the same as in vacuum . the trapping frequency @xmath50 does not change much from 300 torr to 10 torr according to the data .",
    "therefore , the trapping frequency is presumably constant .    * particle size calculation .",
    "* since it is difficult ( and not important ) to know the exact shape and size of the nanodiamond ( which can be irregular ) , we estimate its hydrodynamic size from the viscous damping factor as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the air , @xmath23 is the hydrodynamic radius of the nanodiamond , @xmath56 is the knudsen number with @xmath57 being the mean the free path of air molecules , and @xmath58 .",
    "the mean free path is linearly dependent on the viscosity as @xcite @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the pressure and @xmath61 is the mass of air molecule . in 1866 , maxwell demonstrated that the viscosity of air maintains constant from atmospheric pressure down to a few torr @xcite . at atmospheric pressure , the nanodiamond in fig .",

    "@xcite . to obtain the esr signal , the electron spin states are excited @xmath67 by microwave pulses . for a given frequency , the antenna delivers a sequence of 500  ms alternative on / off microwave pulses to control the electron spin of nv centers .",

    ", the visible fluorescence spectrum of the diamond is acquired using the spectrometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus]a ) .",
    "since the visible fluorescence signal of @xmath68 is weaker than the @xmath12 state , there is a dip in the plot of the normalized @xmath7 when esr happens .",

    "* the zero - field hamiltonian of nv center is written as @xcite @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the energy splitting between spin ground state @xmath12 and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the splitting between @xmath71 due to the broken axial symmetry of the nv center caused by the strain effect @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian results in a double peak resonance spectrum as seen in fig .",

    "the parameter @xmath72 is different for each unique nv center .",
    "overall we observe a separation @xmath73   mhz which is consistent with early measurements in bulk diamond @xcite .",
    "since the ambient magnetic field was measured to be 600  mg using a commercial magnetometer , the separation between two resonance peaks is mainly contributed by the zero - field parameter @xmath72 .",
    "the zero - field splitting parameter @xmath70 depends on temperature as @xcite @xmath74 here @xmath75  ghz , @xmath76  ghz / k , @xmath77  ghz / k@xmath78 , @xmath79  ghz / k@xmath80 , @xmath81  khz / bar is the pressure dependence shift @xcite , and @xmath82 is the internal strain effect depending on the particle .    from atmospheric pressure to 1  torr , the shift due to pressure is about 1.5  khz , equivalent to changing nanodiamond temperature by 20  mk , which is negligible compared to the thermal shift .",
    "each individual nanodiamond has a different internal strain @xmath83 about a few mhz @xcite .",
    "this could lead to an uncertainty of tens of kelvins in measuring the absolute temperature if @xmath82 is neglected . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvpower]c , the temperature of each nanodiamond increases linearly with the trapping power ( within the range of measured data ) , although of the slope of each line is different .",
    "we can use this linear dependence relation to determine the internal strain of each trapped nanodiamond .",
    "one can solve for temperatures @xmath46 from @xmath84 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : dt ] using the parameters @xmath70 obtained from the double gaussian fit of esr spectra @xcite .",
    "since we know the internal temperature of the nanodiamond is at room temperature ( 296  k ) when there is no trapping laser , the linear fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvpower]c should intersect the vertical axis at 296  k when the laser power is zero . from this known temperature at the limit of zero trapping power ,",
    "we determine the internal strain @xmath82 of each individual nanodiamond .",
    "the levitated nanodiamond in a gas or low vacuum is cooled from the collisions with surrounding gas molecules . in the molecular regime ,",
    "the cooling rate is proportional to the gas pressure .",
    "therefore , the temperature of the nanodiamond depends on the pressure of the surrounding gas approximately as @xmath85 with @xmath86 being the room temperature , and @xmath87 being a coefficient that depends the properties of the particle and surrounding gas , and the laser power .",
