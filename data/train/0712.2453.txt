    "when cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons pass through galaxy clusters , they compton up - scatter on hot electrons , making a small increment ( decrement ) above ( below ) the peak of the cmb primary spectrum .",
    "the size of this distortion in the cmb spectrum , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , is proportional to the electron pressure integrated along the line - of - sight . besides being an important probe of the physics of the intracluster medium",
    ", the sz effect is a promising tool in cosmology : the signal produced by a cluster is practically redshift independent and can be observed to high redshifts .",
    "the planck surveyor satellite @xcite will produce a cluster catalogue with up to @xmath010.000 ( sufficiently massive ) clusters out to @xmath1 @xcite . by combining sz and x - ray observations of relaxed clusters",
    "the hubble constant @xmath2 can be derived , limits can be put on @xmath3 , and the gas mass fraction in clusters can be measured @xcite .",
    "the sz effect was first detected in three nearby clusters more than two decades ago by @xcite , but the last five years , due to advances in sub millimetre receiver technology , routine measurements have been done for @xmath4 clusters using facilities such as the ovro and bima telescopes . right now a large number of telescopes have started observing the sz signal or are under construction ( e.g.  acbar , carma , suzie iii , spt , apex etc . ) , and in the near future alma will gradually become online enabling unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for making detailed observations of individual clusters .",
    "current sz surveys of galaxy clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a set of current observations ) have observed the unresolved integrated sz signal from clusters , but with carma , alma and the spt also the sz signal as a function of radius from the cluster centre will be measured .",
    "@xcite has used the 3rd year wmap data to extract sz images from 193 clusters . stacking them",
    "they have obtained an averaged sz profile for clusters with @xmath5kev .",
    "spatially resolved sz images probe , in a way complementary to x - ray observations , the distribution of thermal energy in clusters which in turn is closely linked to the total cluster mass . furthermore",
    ", since the sz effect essentially depends on the electron pressure , the physics going into understanding it is simpler and more robust , than is the case for the x - ray emission .    in this paper",
    "we use realistic high resolution n - body / sph simulations of galaxy clusters and groups together with observed temperature profiles of nearby groups and clusters to predict the radial sz profile of different types of systems of galaxies , and compare our results to the averaged profile of @xcite .",
    "we introduce a universal fitting formula , with only two free parameters , that can be employed in future observations .",
    "furthermore , we show that fitting this profile enables a precise estimate of the total mass in the system . in the next section",
    "we describe the computer experiments , that are used to construct the synthetic sz profiles . in section 3",
    "we discuss the simulated data and present our results , and in section 4 we discuss and provide our conclusions .",
    "we use 24 galaxy group and galaxy cluster simulations to study the sz effect for systems of virial temperatures of about 1 to 6 kev .",
    "the models include 12 groups of approximately the same mass ( @xmath6 ) , 11 identical clusters with @xmath7 ( `` virgo '' clusters ) , but simulated with different gas physics , and a single large cluster of @xmath8 ( a `` coma '' cluster ) .",
    "the models are re - simulated from a low resolution cosmological dark matter simulation , where the halos are identified with a halo finder .",
    "the particles are traced back in time to a initial redshift @xmath9 , and the virial volume is repopulated with both gas and dark matter at a high resolution .",
    "the code includes radiative cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , chemical evolution and back reaction from a redshift dependent uv field .",
    "the different models are summarised in table [ tab : models ] . for a detailed description of the different gas physics going into the code in general , and the `` virgo '' cluster simulations in particular we refer to @xcite .",
    "the groups were all selected at random , the only criterion being their virial mass , and therefore they comprise a cosmological fair sample of groups with @xmath10 .",
    "the different masses of the clusters allow us to probe the mass dependence of the sz profile , while the `` virgo '' models are used to investigate how robust our predictions are for the sz profile with respect to assumptions on the underlying physics .",
    "the groups , being a statistically unbiased sample , give limits on cosmic variance for the given virial mass ( @xmath11 ) .    we have divided the groups into three different classes according to their morphology and evolutionary history : groups with merging activity ( 186,231,239,262 ) , fossil groups ( 189,228,236,244 ) and normal groups ( 190,233,247,276 ) . a group is considered fossil if the difference in apparent r - band magnitude of the first and second brightest galaxy is greater than two @xcite , and a group is merging if it by visual inspection has significant merging activity in the core , or if the rms scatter in 3d radial shells of the temperature , pressure and density , is comparable to the average value in the shell .",

    "[ fig : dmpot ] ) .",
    "this should be recalled when constructing an average observational profile , because the average profile may not represent a true ( `` universal '' ) physical profile , but rather a smeared average of the real profiles .",
    "the central core of the sz profile ( @xmath40 can not be probed by wmap , due to its limited resolution of at most @xmath41 . to extend the dynamic range of the observations we combine gravitational potentials from the simulations with observed average x - ray temperature profiles . under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the core of the systems , we can then predict the inner part of the sz profile .",

    "the dark matter distribution , derived from the simulations , is quite robust against the specific gas physics involved in the simulation .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmpot ] , where it is seen that all the `` virgo '' models , in spite of the different gas physics , have essentially the same gravitational potentials from @xmath48 and outwards . however , there are systematic differences between different types of systems with the same mass .",

    "fig : dmpot ] ) .",
    "therefore the above reconstruction procedure gives a good idea of future resolved sz observations of the cores of clusters of galaxies , and our six resolved profiles are a fair sample of what can be expected .      from fig .",
    "[ fig : szeprofs ] it is clear , that albeit the sz profiles constructed from the observed temperature profiles and the dark matter density profiles are in approximate agreement with the profiles extracted from the simulations , they have a tendency to be more peaked at the centre .",
    "this can be traced to differences in the observed and simulated temperature profiles ( see e.g.  eq .  [",
    "eq : hs ] ) , and to the typical masses of the observed systems .",
    "the different temperature profiles are normalised with a global temperature @xmath49 . to enable direct comparison to the observed temperature profiles by @xcite we compute @xmath49 as the average projected spectral - like temperature @xcite in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "all profiles converge to the same universal curve for @xmath51 , but in the inner part of the systems there are differences ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tempprof ] ) .",
    "the simulated systems have all flat profiles at the core , which are in good qualitative agreement with observations of clusters of similar virial mass , but the average observed profiles have lower normalised temperatures towards the centre , with more or less the same offset between the `` coma '' cluster and the observed cluster profile ( constructed from clusters with 3.5 kev @xmath52 8.5 kev ) , and between the average simulated and observed group temperature profiles ( the latter constructed from groups with @xmath53 kev @xcite ) .",
    "the offset compared to observations and relatively flat temperature profiles are well known problems for simulations invoking radiative cooling and feedback processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is further accentuated by an offset in mass between the observed and simulated groups and the observed clusters , and the simulated `` virgo '' clusters .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : szeprofs ] all the sz profiles have nearly the same form , but the overall normalisation , tension and slope of the different profiles depends on the mass , and the specific cluster . to construct a simple model we have tried to fit a variety of combinations of beta profiles and exponential profiles for the density combined with a polytropic or isothermal equation of state , but it does not yield a satisfactory fit . the correct temperature to use , when constructing a sz profile , is the mass weighted , and it does not necessarily agree with the temperature inferred from x - ray observations ( @xcite ) , which may explain why the above combination works well for x - ray observations , while not so for our sample of sz profiles .    to circumvent this problem we are using a novel universal profile that directly fit the data , without assuming anything about the underlying temperature and density distributions , while using as few parameters as possible .",
    "the main morphological differences are in the slope / tension and in the normalisation of each profile , and it is indeed possible to construct a model , that with only two free parameters , a normalisation , and a characteristic scale can fit the full set of simulations and observations in detail .",
    "the profiles extracted from the simulated data do not per se contain any errors , but a measure of the natural scatter in a profile @xmath54 at a given radial distance , is the variance @xmath55 of @xmath56 inside the radial bin at @xmath57 .",

    "the internal scatter in relaxed systems is much smaller , giving stronger constraints than from merging systems .",

    "( ii ) most of the parameters can be fixed to global values , leaving only two free parameters for fitting all systems considered in this paper . with only two parameters in the model",

    "they are related as @xmath80    to push the boundaries of our fitting formula for other systems we have also applied it to the @xcite data , and the profiles for the centre of the systems , derived from observed temperature profiles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fits ] ) .",
    "the average sz profile is described well by the formula , while there are problems with fitting the core ( @xmath81 ) of the cluster set of central profiles ( the lower right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) . even though some of these combinations ( e.g.  a normal group dm potential combined with a massive cluster temperature profile ) are extreme , the lack of agreement may be because in the central parts of the observed systems there are significant non - thermal contributions to the pressure balance from e.g.  an agn @xcite or from cosmic rays @xcite , and hence the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium does not apply . or it may be that the simulated systems do not include an adequate description of the physical processes in the centre of the systems . nonetheless , the contribution of the central @xmath82 to the total sz signal is approximately 5% , and the parameters are not much affected even if we can not reconstruct the innermost part of the profiles with perfection .",
    "the sz profile of the systems seems to be universally well described by only two parameters , except for possibly in the central parts of the clusters .",
    "it measures the distribution of thermal energy in the system , and is therefore related to the gravitational potential , if we assume the system is relaxed . using assumptions about hydrostatic equilibrium and using a phenomenological approach several `` fundamental plane '' relations",
    "have been constructed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
