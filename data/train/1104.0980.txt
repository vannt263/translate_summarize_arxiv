    "more precisely , the dynamics of the unfolding of the cycle mostly depends on the signs of the central eigenvalues @xmath65 ( associated to @xmath1 ) and @xmath60 ( associated to @xmath2 ) and on the restriction of @xmath76 to the central bundle .",
    "we associate to the cycle the _ signs _ , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in @xmath80 determined by the following rules :    * @xmath81 if @xmath82 and @xmath83 if @xmath84 ; * @xmath85 if @xmath86 and @xmath87 if @xmath88 ; and * @xmath89 if @xmath76 preserves the orientation in the central direction and @xmath90 if the orientation is reversed .",
