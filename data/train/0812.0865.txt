    "the central region of our galaxy suffers large interstellar extinction , and images taken toward the galactic center ( gc ) in the optical wavelengths are generally featureless star fields with few stars . since the discovery of an infrared source corresponding to the gc by becklin and neugebauer ( 1968 ) , the gc region has been observed extensively in the infrared , where interstellar extinction is one order of magnitude smaller than in the optical .",
    "succeeding to the larger - scale near - infrared ( nir ) surveys of 2mass ( skrutskie et al . 2006 ) and denis @xcite , which have given a general view of the galactic structure , we have carried out a @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands survey of the @xmath8 @xmath3 @xmath9 region centered on the gc with 2 mag deeper sensitivity and 2 times finer resolution than those of 2mass . in the course of the survey , we found numerous dark clouds silhouetted against the dense star fields .    toward the gc , existence of many molecular clouds",
    "is well known from radio observations ( morris and serabyn 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "their location in the line of sight is uncertain , but part of them , located on the near side of the gc , should appear as dark clouds in the near infrared images .",
    "however , the correspondence of near infrared dark clouds to radio molecular clouds has not been studied well .",
    "the distance to dark / molecular clouds is crucial for discussing their physical parameters associated with them . in radio observations , kinematic distances to molecular clouds",
    "are often derived from their radial velocity on the assumption that each cloud follows the circular galactic rotation . however , since the galactic rotation is perpendicular to our line of sight to the gc , we can not determine the distance to the molecular clouds .",
    "moreover , non - circular components such as expanding rings make situations complicated .",
    "sofue ( 2006 ) proposed a method to determine the distance of co clouds in the direction of gc from the gradient in the @xmath10 diagram , and determined the distance of co clouds toward the gc .",
    "this method is powerful for determining the distance to arm - like structures , which extend long in the @xmath11 direction , but unsuited for small co clouds because the velocity gradient is not determined well .    in this paper , we report a chain of dark clouds found in our near infrared survey , which shows good positional and morphological agreements with a velocity component of @xmath12co ( @xmath0=1 - 0 ) observed with the nobeyama radio telescope ( oka et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a new method to determine the distance to dark clouds from a diagram of @xmath13 color and cumulative star number , and the resultant distance to the chain of dark clouds are presented .",
    "our near infrared survey toward the ( @xmath14 ) @xmath3 ( @xmath11 ) region of the galactic center was carried out from 2002 to 2004 .",
    "the observation was made with sirius , a simultaneous imager in the @xmath0 ( @xmath15=1.26 ) , @xmath1 ( @xmath15=1.63 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath15=2.14 ) bands , covering an area 7@xmath17 with a pixel scale of 0.45 on the irsf 1.4-m telescope at sutherland , south africa .",
    "the details of the instrument are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we observed totally 891 of 7@xmath17 fields centered on the gc , with 10 times of 5 sec exposure .",
    "the reduction of near - infrared array images was performed with iraf ( imaging reduction & analysis facility ) .",
    "each image , after subtraction of the average dark frame , was divided by the normalized flat - field image .",
    "then , the thermal emission pattern , the fringe pattern due to oh emission , and the slope pattern seen in the hawaii arrays were subtracted from each frame with a median sky frame .",
    "the photometry for point sources was performed with the daophot package @xcite , and calibrated with the standard star 9172 in persson et al .",
    "the 10@xmath18 limiting magnitudes for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath16 bands are 17.1 , 16.6 , and 15.6 mag , respectively , and stars brighter than 10 mag in all the three band are saturated .",
    "more details of our data reduction and photometries are described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath12co ( @xmath0=1 - 0 , 115.271202 ghz ) observations over the area @xmath19 and @xmath20 were carried out from 1995 february to april , and from 1996 march to may with the 45 m telescope of nobeyama radio observatory by oka et al .",
    "the spatial resolution of the telescope was and the grid spacing was , resulting in an actual resolution on the map of .",
    "the details of the observation are described in @xcite .",
    "we reprocessed the data and acquired 88 velocity channel maps covering the velocity range of @xmath21 = @xmath22 to @xmath23 km s@xmath24 , integrated over successive 5 km s@xmath24 widths .",
    "we examined positional and morphological correspondences between the dark clouds seen in our survey and the @xmath12co emission . by comparing our nir images with the velocity - channel maps of the @xmath12co observation",
    ", we found that a filamentary high - intensity edge of @xmath12co contours in the channel 48 ( ch-48 , @xmath25 to @xmath26 km s@xmath24 ) shows good correlation to a chain of dark clouds . in figs.1 ( a)-(c ) , we show the @xmath12co intensity maps of ch-48 together with the adjacent channels ( ch-47 and ch-49 ) .",
    "a filamentary structure extends from ( @xmath11 , @xmath14)@xmath5 ( , ) to ( , ) only in the map of ch-48 .",
    "of particular interest is that the small velocity - width and velocity - gradient confined within single channel or a range less than 5 km s@xmath24 .    for further comparison , we made a contour map of i(ch-48)-(i(ch-47)+i(ch-49))/2 superposed on the number density of stars brighter than 14.5 mag in the @xmath27 band ( fig .",
    "2 ) , in which the shape of @xmath12co contour conform with less star area in positional and morphological .",
    "therefore , the @xmath12co cloud only seen in ch-48 and the chain of dark clouds are presumably identical .",
    "( 80mm,120mm)fig3.eps    determination of the distance to dark clouds is a key in order to discuss the physical properties such as its real size and mass .",
    "we will demonstrate that the cumulative number of stars bluer than a certain @xmath28 color , @xmath29 , is a good indicator to estimate distances to dark clouds .",
    "provided that interstellar extinction and reddening increase monotonously with distance in a line of sight , the observed @xmath28 color of a star depends on the distance to the star .",
    "therefore , the profile of @xmath29 against various @xmath28 is determined by extinction in the line of sight , and conversely , we can estimate the extinction distribution along the line of sight , from the @xmath29 profile .",
    "the number of stars to be observed can be predicted using the infrared model of the galaxy ( wainscoat et al .",
    "we add an artificial screen with an extinction @xmath30 at the distance @xmath31 as a dark cloud , besides the general interstellar extinction @xmath32 in the model . here",
    ", we assume that the thickness of dark clouds along the line of sight is thin enough compared with the galactic scale ; the thickness of screen is zero in our calculation .",
    "we then calculate @xmath33 to be observed with our actual limiting magnitudes of @xmath34 and @xmath2=15.0 mag .",
    "the detail of calculation is described in appendix .",
    "3 shows predicted @xmath35 toward @xmath36 against @xmath13 .",
    "first , we discuss the case that the cloud is a complete screen and we can not detect stars behind the cloud . in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) , the 10 lines ( @xmath31 = 1.0 to 6.0 kpc with a step of 0.5 kpc ) are shown , together with the line without a screen .",
    "the top thick line represents the case of no - screen with only interstellar extinction , while the 10 lines are for a complete screen with @xmath37 in addition to interstellar extinction . in these cases , @xmath33 is contributed by only foreground stars .    the @xmath33 profiles with the complete screen increase as same as the no - screen @xmath33 profile at small @xmath4 because of the foreground stars , but are detached from the no - screen line , beginning with the nearest @xmath31 case . because the detached points are different for different @xmath31 , we can determine @xmath31 by comparing predicted and observed detached points .",
    "after detached from the no - screen line , the increase of @xmath33 stops at @xmath38 , the number of foreground stars detectable with our sensitivity .",
    "@xmath38 is uniquely determined for @xmath31 in the cases of completely obscuring clouds .",
    "next , we discuss the case that the cloud does not obscure the stars behind completely . in this case , certain number of stars behind the cloud are detected with extra extinction and reddening due to the cloud .",
    "3 ( b ) shows the case of @xmath39 kpc with @xmath40 mag ( 0.1 mag step ) , 1.2 , 1.5 and @xmath41 mag .",
    "as we described in fig 3 ( a ) , @xmath35 with @xmath37 stays at @xmath38 because background stars are undetectable . in the case of @xmath30=1.0 mag ,",
    "all background stars are about 2 mag ( @xmath42 , nishiyama et al .",
    "2006a ) reddened in @xmath43 by the screen .",
    "therefore , the increase of the @xmath33 with @xmath30=1.0 stops at @xmath38 at @xmath13=1 , but @xmath35 increases again from @xmath13=3 due to contribution of background stars . because the different @xmath30 gives different width of @xmath13 stopping at @xmath38 , we can determine @xmath32 from it .    as we described using fig .",
    "3 ( a ) and ( b ) , the @xmath35 profiles reflects @xmath31 and @xmath30 , separately . therefore , we can determine the @xmath31 and @xmath30 by comparing the observed @xmath35 with the template parameterized by @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "4 shows simplified templates to determine @xmath31 and @xmath30 for @xmath36 ; a total of 13 lines for the cases of no dark screen ( interstellar extinction only ) and combination of @xmath30 ( 0.5 and 1.0 mag ) and @xmath31 ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 kpc ) are shown .",
    "because the lines with various combination of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are well separated from each other , we can assign an unique pair of @xmath44 and @xmath31 for the observed @xmath35 profile of dark clouds .",
    "( 180mm,120mm)fig4.eps      in the wolf diagram , a traditional method to estimate the distance to dark clouds , cumulative number of stars observed brighter than magnitude @xmath45 , @xmath46 , is adopted instead of @xmath29 .",
    "the distance to the dark cloud is estimated from the apparent magnitude where the @xmath46 profile for the dark cloud is detached from that for the comparison field . in reality , however , the detached point is very ambiguous due to the large dispersion in the absolute magnitudes of the stars as pointed out by trumpler and weaver ( 1953 ) .",
    "by contrast , the intrinsic color of stars in the near infrared tends to be similar among almost all the spectral types ; the @xmath28 of dwarfs and giants lie between 0.0 and 1.0 ( wainscoat et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the color excess @xmath47 due to interstellar reddening is also expected up to @xmath48 mag at the distance of the gc .",
    "thus , the large change of @xmath28 compared with the ambiguity of intrinsic @xmath28 of stars enables us to determine the distance to dark clouds .",
    "ten zones were selected around and in the chain of dark clouds : two reference fields ( rf1 and rf2 ) and eight dark clouds ( dc1 to dc8 ) ( fig . 5 ) . in order to confirm the reliability of the galaxy model toward the gc region , we compared the observed and calculated @xmath33 toward the reference fields , rf1 and rf2 .",
    "the @xmath33 profiles for two reference fields are both in fairly good agreements ( figs . 6 ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "we therefore regarded the galaxy model as reliable enough and adopt it for determination of the distances .",
    "we calculated @xmath35 for dc1 to dc8 .",
    "we tried to search for the best fit variables , @xmath49 and @xmath31 , with steps of 0.2 mag and 0.1 kpc , respectively .",
    "the model lines with best fit @xmath49 and @xmath31 for dc1 - 8 are shown together with the observed @xmath35 histograms ( figs . 6 ( c)-(j ) ) .",
    "the best fit lines show good agreement compared to the rf1 and rf2 , where the model lines show small discrepancies . a possible reason that the fittings for rf1 and rf2 are worse than those for the dark cloud regions",
    "is the uncertainty of model for the inner - galaxy , which becomes insignificant when dark clouds are present .",
    "the results for dc1-dc8 , summarized in table 1 , show convergence to a specific distance of 3.2 - 4.2 kpc .",
    "presumably , these dark clouds lie on a single chain of molecular clouds at a distance of @xmath54 kpc with the extinctions range of @xmath49 @xmath5 0.4 to 1.0 mag .",
    "the interstellar extinction in front of the clouds , @xmath32 , is estimated to be 0.4 to 0.5 mag from the model calculation .",
    "most of the dark clouds previously studied are nearby , and the foreground extinction is negligibly small .",
    "in contrast , the dark clouds studied in this paper are significantly farther , and therefore the cumulative interstellar extinction is comparable to @xmath49 .",
    "the co cloud discussed in this paper was also identified with @xmath5021 km s@xmath24 and @xmath51 km s@xmath24/deg ( sofue 2006 ) .",
    "its distance was derived to be 4.7 kpc for @xmath528.0 kpc , which is now 4.4 kpc for @xmath527.5 kpc , and is slightly larger value than ours .",
    "the distance @xmath53 kpc is halfway to the gc at the distance of 7.5 kpc from us . according to valle ( 2008 ) , a summary of previous studies of galactic structure ,",
    "three arms , sagittarius - carina , scutum - crux and norma arms intervene between the galactic center and us . in fig . 1 of valle ( 2008 ) , these three arms are placed to cross with the line of sight to the gc at approximately 0.8 , 2.8 and 4.0 kpc from us , respectively .",
    "it is reasonable that the dark / molecular cloud is located around norma arm , and rotates around the gc with a non - circular velocity components @xmath5420 km @xmath55 toward the gc .",
    "the four - kpc molecular ring ( clemens , sanders and scoville 1988 , nakanishi and sofue 2006 ) is also known as a component , crossing the line of sight to the gc .",
    "however , valle ( 2008 ) claimed that the four - kpc molecular ring is just assemblage of starting segments of four spiral arms , and we therefore leave it out of consideration .",
    "we estimated a projected length of the chain of dark clouds to be @xmath570 pc and the typical thickness of the filaments is as thin as 0.1 degree , or about 7 pc , located at @xmath530 pc off from the galactic plane .",
    "the gaseous filaments are themselves divided into finer structures , and several high - intensity knots are seen on the ridge of the @xmath12co contours . by integrating the @xmath12co excess in the fig .",
    "2 , the masses of each ridges are estimated to be an order of @xmath510@xmath6 m , and the total mass for the entire co cloud results in 6@xmath310@xmath6 m . if we assume the same thickness in the line of sight ( 7 pc ) as the apparent thickness and an extent of 70 pc , this total mass yields molecular gas density on the order of 18 mpc@xmath56 , or 4@xmath310@xmath57 h@xmath58 cm@xmath56 .",
    "this is a typical density for normal molecular clouds .    in the three high - intensity knots",
    ", we found four nir sources , sf1-a , sf1-b , sf2 , and sf3 , with extents of @xmath60 to @xmath61 or 0.2 - 0.8 pc at 4 kpc .",
    "pseudo color images and position of them are shown in fig . 7 and table 2 .",
    "mid infrared sources ( msx - psc , @xcite ) are associated with all of them .",
    "oh , h@xmath58o , and/or ch@xmath62oh masers ( simbad , or @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) are also associated with sf1-a , sf1-b , and sf3 with @xmath21=@xmath63 to @xmath64 km s@xmath24 , quite consistent to @xmath21 of @xmath12co .",
    "both their sizes and @xmath2 magnitudes in 2mass point source catalog ( 9.15 , 7.67 , and 7.80 for sf1-a , sf2 , and sf3 ) are consistent with those of typical compact hii regions at a distance @xmath54 kpc.we infer that the dark / molecular cloud discovered in this survey are molecular clouds in the norma spiral arm at 4 kpc from us .",
