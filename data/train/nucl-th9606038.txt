    "in qcd , the basic theory of strong interactions ( responsible for the hadronic structure ) , elementary constituents ( quarks ) which are massless if chiral symmetry is preserved can acquire a dynamically generated mass associated to the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry that takes place when the strong interaction reaches a critical intensity . on the other hand , although not conclusively proved in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions , qcd seems to be a confining theory .",
    "assuming that the energy scale for the chiral symmetry breaking is higher than the corresponding one for confinement ( @xmath1 ) , one gets the image of a baryon as a confined system of interacting massive quarks and goldstone bosons coming from the symmetry breakdown .",
    "little more than this qualitative statement can be said from qcd at the current moment since the lack of an adequate method to describe a bound state within a quantum field theory , together with the non  perturbative character of the interaction below @xmath2 , makes difficult any attempt to go further . as a consequence several models of hadronic structure have been developed . among them",
    "perhaps the ones closer related to the image of qcd just drawn are the bag models where the quarks move almost freely inside a confinement region , the bag , surrounded by a mesonic cloud .",
    "however the separation of the center of mass motion ( indispensable to tackle the problem of baryon structure ) added to the fact that one has to simultaneously solve for the movement of the quarks and the bag surface , make the model technically complex . to avoid these difficulties one could wonder whether it would be possible or not to construct an equivalent ( regarding the low  energy description ) non  relativistic model .",
    "undoubtedly the extensions and refinements from the naive quark model of hadron structure @xcite are steps in this direction . in this line",
    "de rjula _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived an interquark potential from the non  relativistic reduction of the one gluon exchange diagram in qcd to be considered together with the phenomenological confining interaction .",
    "the resulting non  relativistic quark model ( nrqm ) reproduces the image of the quark core of the bag , the mesonic cloud having been obviated . the absence of mesons together with the non  relativistic treatment poses serious doubts about its usefulness unless the incorporation of new terms in the potential and/or the effectiveness of the parameters of the model allows to mitigate at least partially these shortcomings . as an immediate consequence of this way of proceeding",
    ", the constituent quarks loose a direct connection to the quark fields of the qcd lagrangian , representing effective degrees of freedom .",
    "this viewpoint is also supported by the absence of a strong necessity to introduce in the interaction between quarks some terms issued from the one gluon exchange such as the spin  orbit or tensor forces @xcite .",
    "the first requirement to such an effective model should be a good description of the hadronic spectrum ( at least at low energies ) that allows a correct assignment of the theoretical states to the experimental ones .",
    "this can be accomplished with relative success for mesons as well as for baryons by a `` minimal '' model involving confinement plus part of the one gluon exchange ( oge ) potentials @xcite .",
    "nevertheless an endemic problem in the low energy spectrum remains , that is the impossibility to correctly predict the masses for the first radial excitations in the baryonic octet and decuplet .",
    "the systematic of this wrong prediction led some authors @xcite to add a phenomenological three ",
    "quark force getting the correct baryonic spectrum ( for negative and positive parity states with and without strangeness simultaneously ) up to an excitation energy of 0.7 gev without need to resort to any specific resonance mechanism .",
    "this model , that will serve as our starting point now , presents however some conceptual problems which we shall consider firstly .",
    "the second requirement is the correct description of the baryon properties , what involves the wave functions of the baryons on the one hand , the operator relative to the process under discussion on the other hand . having a model that correctly describes the low energy baryonic spectrum",
    ", it is appropriate to compare its predictions to those of other models that do not do so well for the baryon masses .",
    "this may allow us to determine whether there is some bias to be introduced in the comparison to experiments due to a poor prediction of baryon masses ( though some discrepancy may be due to different physical ingredients ) .",
    "this comparison was our main intent originally for looking at the strong pion decays of baryons .",
    "it however appeared that results were very much sensitive to the microscopic description of the process .",
    "this led us to examine various aspects of the problem , where relativity is often present in one way or another .",
    "the present work is part of a general program tending to extract from the comparison of the models to each other and to the data some general features of the `` true '' wave functions that in their turn should serve as a guide to further refinements of the models themselves .",
    "the contents of the presentation are organized hereforth as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the quark models we make use of and their predictions for static properties . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we study strong pion decay processes within two different approaches , namely the elementary emission model ( eem ) and the quark pair creation model ( qpcm ) that we modify in order to correct its energy dependence . finally in section 5",
    "we summarize our main conclusions",
    "the non  relativistic quark model of hadron structure describes the hadron ( color singlet bound state ) in terms of a definite number of components ( constituent quarks @xmath3 , and antiquarks @xmath4 ) that interact through an effective potential .",
    "the analysis of the mesonic ( @xmath5 ) and baryonic ( @xmath6 ) spectrum leads to a minimum two  body potential containing the basic qcd motivated , confining , coulombic ( oge ) and spin  spin ( oge ) @xmath7 interactions , of the form :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a constant to fix the origin of the potential , @xmath10 is the distance between quarks @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the pauli matrices .",
    "the yukawa form of the spin ",
    "spin term replace the @xmath14 contact interaction of the oge potential @xcite to avoid an unbounded spectrum when solving the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath15 are chosen to fit the baryon magnetic moments and the three parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , fitted from the meson spectrum @xcite ( see table 1 ) provide a good description of the baryonic octet and decuplet @xcite , a part of which is reproduced in fig .",
    "a look at this figure makes clear a general deficiency in the description : the masses of the positive parity excitations that correspond to radial excitations of the totally symmetric spatial components of the wave function are systematically higher ( from 200 to 400 mev ) than the experimental ones .",
    "any attempt to correct this situation by a refitting of the parameters causes undesirable effects on the rest of the spectrum",
    ". then the open question refers to the possibility of solving the problem by means of the introduction of some physically founded new term in the potential .    attending the mixed symmetric spatial structure of the first negative parity excitations",
    "it becomes obvious that they will be much less affected by an interaction tending to group the three quarks than the spatially symmetric ground states and its first radial excitations .",
    "having in mind a genuine three quark interaction as the exchange of two sigma mesons at the same point , desplanques _",
    "@xcite proposed a three  body potential    @xmath19    the low energy baryonic spectrum can be then well reproduced with a two plus three body interaction :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 differs from @xmath22 in the values of the parameters .",
    "as a consequence the unified description of both the mesons and baryonic spectra given by @xmath22 is lost .",
    "more than a drawback one should consider this as the natural outcome of the effectiveness of the parameters ( through them for instance , some mesonic effects , only present in the baryonic case might be incorporated ) .    the form used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the potential , eq .",
    "( [ vsigma ] ) , shows some non  appealing features . concerning the two  body piece @xmath21 , the range of the spin ",
    "spin interaction , @xmath23 fm , needed in @xcite is very far from the one which could reasonably be expected given the original @xmath14 form of this interaction @xcite .",
    "this comes from the minimum number of parameters constraint @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless one can get a much more `` reasonable '' range ( 0.4 fm ) without increasing the number of parameters by recovering the original oge potential relation between the coulombian intensity @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and the spin ",
    "spin one @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , i.e. @xmath28 . the resulting value of @xmath18 might represent somehow an effective average between 0 fm , the oge @xmath29term range , and @xmath30 1 fm , the range of the quark pionic exchange not implemented in our model .",
    "this impression seems to be reinforced by the corresponding value of the effective qcd coupling constant , @xmath31 , that doubles the one needed in models where pionic quark exchanges are explicitly incorporated @xcite .    from now on we shall call @xmath32 the two plus three body interaction with @xmath21 corrected as explained .",
    "the fit to the spectrum with this corrected potential ( see table 1 ) a part of which is reproduced in fig .",
    "2 , hardly differs from that in ref @xcite .    regarding the 3body piece of the interaction ( [ vsigma ] ) , @xmath33 , its long range , 0.8 fm , can find a justification attending the small value of the coefficient of the linear potential ( or equivalently its small contribution to the string tension ) .",
    "for higher angular momentum states where the quarks are very far apart , the long range of @xmath33 would allow a contribution to the string tension to explain the leading regge trajectories .",
    "it is difficult however to justify if we think of the three nucleon force this 3quark term would give rise to . to correct for this behaviour a less singular form of the interaction is required . for the sake of technical simplicity we shall adopt here a gaussian form    @xmath34    very easy to be used in the hyperspherical harmonic formalism ( appendix a ) @xcite we work with .",
    "the parameters of the potential    @xmath35    appear in table 1 ( note that the range of @xmath36 has gone down to 0.25 fm and that we have relaxed the constraint between @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) , and the comparative spectrum , of similar quality to the @xmath32 s one , appears ( in part ) in fig .",
    "3 .    with regard to other parameters of the potential",
    "some comments are in order . for the quark masses , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ,",
    "a value between 300 and 360 mev , that fits the nucleon magnetic moments ( assuming an su(6 ) spatially symmetric wave function ) within a 10 % of error , is generally accepted .",
    "it can be shown ( appendix a ) that , from the potential we are dealing with , one can obtain via an adequate redefinition of the parameters of the potentials , a non  strange energy spectrum ( for quark mass @xmath39 ) whose energies , @xmath40 , are related to the initial ones @xmath41 ( for quark mass @xmath42 ) by    @xmath43    and with no other change than a distance rescaling in the wave functions .",
    "hence given a fit to the spectrum for a given quark mass , eq .",
    "( [ eqmass ] ) gives the shifted relative energies when changing the quark mass , i.e. the baryon magnetic moment .",
    "the strength of the confining term is considerably reduced due to the presence of the three body force ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this gives rise to a grouping of the states in the high energy part of the spectrum that could be suggesting the need of some qualitative change in the three  body or in the confinement pieces .",
    "nevertheless the lack of precise experimental information in this region together with the very probable presence of significant relativistic effects prevent us from extracting quantitative conclusions from it .",
    "once , via the fit of the spectrum , some physical states are unambiguously ascribed to model states ( up to 0.7 gev excitation energy ) we should focus on the description of the baryonic properties . as explained before the nucleon magnetic moments are reasonably well reproduced ( see table 2 ) with masses between 300 and 360 mev indicating the dominance of the spatially symmetric component of the wave function ( see fig .",
    "a different case is the mass and charge root mean square radius ( r.m.s . ) . for the nucleon charge radius for instance the predicted values are too low compared to the data",
    "this can be understood by taking into account that our effective scheme only incorporates the description of the core of quarks , whose pretty small size has to do with the pressure exerted by the mesonic cloud that in our meson  absent models is simulated through the effective values of the parameters .",
    "then , if the mesonic contribution to the total mass is small as compared to the core contribution ( as it happens to be the case in the bag models ) , one can understand the r.m.s.spectrum puzzle , i.e. the impossibility within a model scheme that only plays with effective quark degrees of freedom of simultaneously fitting the spectrum and the total sizes .",
    "furthermore the absence of ( @xmath0 ) components in the wave function should be at least in part also responsible for the high values ( 5/3 ) predicted for the axial coupling constant @xmath44 as it is suggested by bag model calculations @xcite .    as a corollary",
    "it may be established that when dealing with physical processes where the mesonic cloud plays a relevant role as such the use of a spectroscopic quark model requires the use of effective operators that can give account of it .",
    "hence for the strong pion decay we consider next a careful analysis of the transition matrix elements is needed before a comparison between different spectroscopic quark models makes any sense .",
    "to study strong baryonic decays we shall follow the elementary emission model approach developed long time ago @xcite .",
    "the decay takes place through the emission of a point  like pion by one of the quarks of the baryon ( fig .",
    "5 ) and therefore the coupling constant is unique for all the processes .    up to order ( @xmath45 ) the matrix elements for the process @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath47 @xcite with    @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the factor 3 comes from the number of quarks , @xmath49 and @xmath50 stand for the pion energy and trimomentum respectively and @xmath51 is the quark 3 coordinate .",
    "the upper index ( 3 ) on the operators of spin , @xmath52 , isospin , @xmath53 , and quark trimomentum , @xmath54 , indicates that we have chosen for later technical simplicity the quark 3 to perform the calculations .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath55 is related to the usual @xmath56 through the quark ",
    "pion mass ratio :    @xmath57    and is the only free parameter of the model .    the ` non  relativistic ' @xmath58 interaction given by @xmath59 may be obtained from the @xmath58 invariant interaction with the pseudovector coupling @xmath60 .",
    "it differs from that obtained with the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath61 since at first order in @xmath62 , this one does not give rise to the term proportional to @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ notengomaslabeles ] ) ( it only gives the @xmath63 term ) .",
    "the examination of the higher order terms in @xmath62 in the pseudoscalar coupling case shows that there are some @xmath64 corrections to the @xmath63 term which are identical to those that would be derived in the pseudovector coupling .",
    "as an expansion in @xmath64 is meaningless in view of the large value taken by this quantity ( larger than 1 , with often a destructive interference at the first order ) we prefer to freeze these @xmath65 terms and replace them by some constant . in practice",
    ", this means that they will be hidden in the coupling @xmath55 to be fitted to reproduce the @xmath66 coupling .",
    "the other @xmath64 corrections in the pseudoscalar coupling represent the difference in the kinetic energies of quarks in the initial and final states , which enters in @xmath49 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the difference in potential energies in the initial and final states , which is also included in @xmath49 , is provided by terms involving the excitation of a quark ",
    "antiquark pair ( this one is known to be important in the pseudoscalar coupling ) .    notwithstanding that it corresponds to a higher order term in @xmath62 in the pseudoscalar coupling , we shall maintain the term proportional to @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ notengomaslabeles ] ) , because of its different functional structure . altogether , eq . ( [ notengomaslabeles ] )",
    "amounts to retain for the different types of terms , @xmath63 and @xmath68 , corresponding to the lowest order contributions in @xmath62 , relativistic corrections being embedded in the parameter @xmath55 or in the factor @xmath49 itself .    in order to evaluate the matrix elements of the hamiltonian",

    "the corresponding term combines with the first term proportional to @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ amplitudgorda ] ) to get a term proportional to @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) in the non relativistic limit ) , which ensures the galilean invariance of the amplitude at the lowest order in @xmath83 .",
    "this invariance of the amplitude at the quark level was imposed by mitra and ross @xcite to introduce in the @xmath58 interaction some @xmath49 dependent term , quite similar to the one in eq .",
    "( [ notengomaslabeles ] ) .",
    "we shall work in the frame where the decaying resonance is at rest ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "for later purpose it is convenient to reexpress the amplitudes in the more compact form :    @xmath85    the notation @xmath86 , @xmath87 is a technical one .",
    "@xmath88 includes derivatives ( coming from the momentum operator @xmath89 ) whereas @xmath90 does not .",
    "they are directly related to the more physical recoil ( depending on the recoil momentum ( @xmath91 ) ) and direct ( depending of the pion momentum @xmath50 ) contributions .",

    "the baryon masses depend on the spectroscopic model , so that for @xmath32 and @xmath93 they are pretty close to the experimental ones , whereas for @xmath22 the difference ( especially for the roper decays ) can be very significant .",
    "nevertheless as we shall be interested ( once the transition operator has been chosen ) in testing the baryonic wave functions we shall use the same kinematics , i.e. the experimental values of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in all our calculations .",
    "there is no unique criterium in the literature to fix @xmath55 .",
    "for instance @xmath55 could be chosen to get the best global fit to the data @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , for the purpose of analyzing the baryonic wave function another possibility is more convenient , namely to fit @xmath55 to reproduce the @xmath96 interaction at low momentum transfers .",

    "once @xmath55 has been fitted in this almost model independent manner , the predictions of the models serve as a test , within a eem scheme , of the baryonic wave functions .",

    "the reason for it is clear when making an expansion in powers of k :    @xmath118    thus for the small values of k one is directly testing the root mean square mass radius :    @xmath119    which turns out to be too small for @xmath32 and @xmath93 .",
    "this is not certainly a surprise from our considerations in section 2 since it can be an indication that relativistic effects , pionic components ( @xmath0 ) , etc may be playing a role .",
    "alternatively it may be suggesting the need to refine the three  body potential .",
    "to pursue the analysis of the wave functions , within the eem , we evaluate the widths for strong pion decays of nucleon and delta resonances .",
    "the results are listed in table 3 .",
    "although it is difficult to extract general features from them ( the almost zero widths for the processes involving the ground state and its first radial excitation , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , comes from the orthogonality of their radial wave functions ) we can say that for decays clearly dominated by the non  derivative part of the amplitude ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) the three potentials work reasonably well , the better the result the bigger the predicted radius for the nucleon .",
    "this comes along the same line that our previous discussion for the @xmath96 form factor since the non  derivative terms involve the average wave function overlap .",
    "in order to try to include size contributing components , we shall explore next the possibility of incorporating the pion structure in a non  relativistic scheme .",
    "to implement the mesonic structure several formalisms have been developed @xcite , all of them sharing the image of the meson emission as the creation of a @xmath5 pair that by later recombination gives rise to the outgoing meson .    at the effective level we work ,",

    "the @xmath124 qpcm is manageable and comparable in the limit of point pion to the eem . schematically the process is pictured in fig .",

    "this comes about due to the introduction of the pion structure ; in the eem model the constancy of @xmath55 had to do with the fact that the baryonic quark structure contributes through model independent normalization integrals whereas in the qpcm case the presence of the pion wave function weights in a different form the quark structures giving provoking a model dependence in @xmath128 that reflects the very different quark  model baryon wave functions , with and without three  quark force .",

    "@xmath157 gev@xmath143 ( very close to the one obtained with @xmath22 ) the constant @xmath128 would be 6.29 ( 6.97 with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the widths obtained with the @xmath124 model appear in table 5 .",
    "we see that the introduction of the pion structure does not seem to represent any improvement of the results but rather on the contrary a worsening of the fit .",
    "as the specific form of the pion wave function is not very relevant we center our attention in the transition operator .",
    "possible corrections to it may have a relativistic origin and can be enforced on the basis of general principles .",
    "first there is a normalization factor @xmath158 which is related to the boost of the pion from its rest frame to the rest frame of the initial baryon . on the other hand , if one desires the quark momentum term to have the same properties as the @xmath50 dependent one under exchanging the role of initial and final states it has to be associated to the difference of the energies of the initial and final states , which is nothing but @xmath49 . in the non  relativistic limit , this factor tends to @xmath159 and it is therefore natural to introduce the factor @xmath160 in front of the momentum term .",
    "this considerations can be implemented in eq .",
    "( [ non  local ] ) by introducing a factor @xmath158 and by multiplying the momentum ( @xmath161 ) dependent term by @xmath160 . actually by making the additional replacement of the @xmath50 coefficient @xmath162 by @xmath163 these changes",
    "are equivalent to modify the qpcm to get as the point pion limit the eem . adopting this point of view",
    "we define our @xmath124 modified qpcm through the operator :    @xmath164    by repeating the calculational process as explained in section 4.1 and 4.2 the improvement of the fit with this modified qpcm is spectacular as seen in table 6 ( the normalized form factor hardly changes and we do not draw it again ) . except for @xmath165 and @xmath166 where the strong cancellation between derivative and non  derivative terms makes the result very sensitive to their precise values",
    "all the widths are reproduced withing a factor 2 .",
    "( let us remark that the experimental interval has been taken as the most  restrictive one , i.e. by applying the corresponding variable decay percentage to the central value of the width ) .",
    "the results for the transitions involving the nucleon ( or @xmath167 particle ) and its radial excitations , @xmath168 ( or @xmath169 ) should be noticed .",
    "the finite size of the pion makes them sizeable and in rough agreement with experiment .",
    "this is achieved without relying on @xmath170 corrections which in the eem would probably allow one to get a similar result .",
    "indeed , the orthogonality of wave functions , which explains the low transition rates given in table 3 , does not apply anymore when the operator nature of these corrections is accounted for .",
    "the overall results for the three potentials do not differ very much . added to the @xmath96 form factor prediction and keeping in mind that other corrections , as the ones coming from the @xmath167width in the final states , could be evaluated , the small remaining discrepancies with experimental data might then have to do with a fine tuning improvement of the quark potential on the base of increasing the quark model radii .",
    "a refinement of a non  relativistic quark model that by means of the incorporation of a three quark potential is able to reproduce the nucleon and delta low energy spectra has been carried out avoiding some conceptual difficulties associated to the very singular form of the three ",
    "body force and to the values of the potential parameters in the original version .",
    "the predictions for static properties point out the need of incorporating ( @xmath171 ) components into the wave function .",
    "an effective manner to do this when studying strong decay processes is through the transition operator defining the calculation scheme either via a modification of the coupling constant as in a elementary emission model ( eem ) or additionally via the explicit implementation of @xmath5 pair creation as in the quark pair creation models ( qpcm ) .",
    "we do find some sensitivity to the way the @xmath172decay process occurs at the microscopic level .",
    "so the @xmath124 qpcm largely overestimates majority of the decay rates .",
    "discrepancies were found to have an origin in relativistic effects .",
    "starting from this observation , the qpcm was modified by incorporating those corrections which stem from general principles , making it closer to the eem .",
    "the quality of the results we thus obtain seems to support our prescription . despite large differences in the short distance description of baryons used in our calculations , we did not find any reason to discriminate them by looking at the @xmath172 decay properties once",
    "the experimental kinematics is considered . introducing a three body force in the description of baryons",
    "makes the agreement with experiment slightly better in some cases , slightly worse in others .",
    "probably , the observable we examined is not appropriate to extract any correlation between the predictions for the spectrum and the decay widths .",
    "anyhow as a general conclusion it can be established that a unified description of the spectrum and the strong baryonic decays in a non  relativistic scheme seems plausible .",
