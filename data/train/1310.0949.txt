    "classical nova outbursts occur in binary systems where a white dwarf accretes matter from a less evolved secondary ( either main sequence , sub - giant or red giant ; see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the outburst is produced when the white dwarf has accreted sufficient matter for the material at the base of the accreted envelope to have a pressure and temperature high enough for nuclear fusion to occur .",
    "this leads to a thermonuclear runaway , causing the rapid rise in luminosity and ejection of accreted material observed during outburst ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "dust formation has been observed in galactic novae for about 40 years ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review of the early observations ) , and observations have recently extended to the potentially much larger sample of extragalactic novae ( @xcite ) .",
    "a nova outburst in a system containing a co white dwarf ( co nova ) can produce silicates , silicon carbide , carbon or hydrocarbons , or indeed a combination of these ( @xcite ) . only a small portion ( probably @xmath0 ; @xcite ) of a galaxy s interstellar dust originates in novae , but novae",
    "may be an important source of some elements and isotopes ; indeed they are predicted to be the major source of @xmath1c , @xmath2n and @xmath3o @xcite .",
    "the link between dust formation and speed class was first suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the relationship between speed class and ir development to explain why fast novae seemed less able to form extensive dust shells .",
    "we now know that it is the generally very fast neon novae , however , that produce little or no detected dust",
    ". it may be that co novae generally produce more dust because they contain lower mass white dwarfs , hence an outburst involves higher ejected mass at lower velocities @xcite .",
    "any dust formed in the nova environment is subjected to the strong radiation field that it produces .",
    "however some factors of the environment in nova ejecta are favourable to dust formation , such as the high densities and heavy element abundances found therein .",
    "the rates of many reactions which must take place in order for nucleation sites to form are also higher at the temperatures found here @xcite .    in novae",
    ", dust formation typically occurs between one and five months post - outburst and observations show that this timescale depends on the rate the nova fades in the optical ( the speed class ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , with dust condensation time , @xmath4 , being longer for slower novae .",
    "indeed , figure 11 in @xcite shows there appears to be a strong correlation between @xmath4 and the time it takes for the brightness of a nova to decline by two magnitudes , @xmath5 .",
    "however this relationship has not been explained theoretically .",
    "this work therefore aims to better understand the relationship between dust formation timescale and speed class . during a nova outburst the spectrum of the central hot source evolves as the temperature of the pseudo - photosphere increases ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at higher temperatures more radiation",
    "is systematically emitted at higher energies than the lyman limit and therefore can be absorbed by neutral hydrogen ( see section  [ sec : lym ] ) . using this hypothesis , the basic theory described in section [ simplistic ]",
    "is modified and the results are compared to the observational data .",
    "from energy balance considerations , @xcite find the dust formation timescale , @xmath4 , is given by    @xmath6^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the luminosity of the nova as seen by the grains ( usually assumed to be the bolometric luminosity - see section [ sec : lym ] ) , @xmath8 is ejection velocity , @xmath9 is planck mean absorptivity , @xmath10 is the planck mean emissivity and @xmath11 is the dust condensation temperature .",
    "hence , from equation  ( [ eq : tcond ] )    @xmath12    using the maximum magnitude@xmath13rate of decline ( mmrd ) relationship from @xcite , it can be shown that    @xmath14    and thus if @xmath15 @xcite , then    @xmath16    an empirically determined relationship from @xcite gives    @xmath17    where @xmath8 is in kms@xmath18 and @xmath19 is in units of days . in a survey of m31 novae ,",
    "@xcite find a similar relationship from line widths . therefore    @xmath20    substituting equations  ( [ eq : lt2rel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lt2rel2 ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : tcondl ] ) shows @xmath4 is then predicted to be approximately independent of @xmath5 . taking , for example , the value of @xmath21 from @xcite results in the @xmath22 dependency of :    @xmath23    however , as can be seen in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 11 ) this is clearly not the case and this basic analysis needs modifying .",
    "our modification of the theory is described in section  [ sec : lym ] . if there was no significant mmrd relationship as discussed by @xcite , @xmath4 would be dependent on @xmath19 and would be given by    @xmath24    a full quantitative analysis then reveals however that even if we assume very low luminosities ( which are more conducive to earlier dust formation ) , dust is predicted to form far later than is ever observed .      as a first step in refining the simplistic model described above",
    ", we assume the grain nucleation sites only see emission at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although simple uniform - chemistry models predict that the ejecta would be fully ionised before dust formation takes place ( e.g. @xcite ) , it is well known that the chemistry leading to the formation of nucleation sites needs dense , cool , neutral clumps ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , there is strong observational evidence  in the form of nai ( ionisation potential 5.14  ev ) and co emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) shortly before dust formation  for the presence of cool hydrogen - neutral clumps which are likely at the outer edge of the ionised wind ; nucleation sites in such clumps will indeed be exposed only to radiation longward of the lyman limit . in our analysis",
    "we assume the dust is formed at the outer extremities of the ejected shell .",
    "the initial step is to take the bolometric luminosity as constant ( e.g.  @xcite ) and defined by the speed class and then we find the fraction of this luminosity that is red - ward of the lyman limit for any given nova at any given time .",
    "we define the peak absolute magnitude , @xmath25 , of a given nova using the mmrd relation    @xmath26    ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . assuming the bolometric correction bc = 0 at the peak of the visual light curve ( as it seems most novae at maximum have an effective photospheric temperature of about 8000k - see @xcite ) , @xmath25 is then converted to luminosity to give the bolometric luminosity , @xmath27 , corresponding to each @xmath5 .",
    "the temperature of the pseudo - photosphere is at a minimum at the time of visual maximum , which is in turn reached within the first few days of outburst in most novae . at this time ,",
    "almost all of the radiation is at wavelengths longer than the lyman limit .",
    "the fraction of radiation red - ward of the lyman limit can be calculated from the effective temperature , @xmath28 , given by the following equation from @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the pseudo - photospheric temperature at visual peak ( @xmath31  k as noted above , @xcite ) and @xmath32 is the change in magnitude from peak . in order to find @xmath28 as a function of time we produced model optical light curves for each @xmath5 value .    to do this , first the outburst amplitude , @xmath33 , for each @xmath5 value was estimated using the @xmath34 line in the amplitude@xmath13log @xmath5 relationship plot in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the average flux observed from accretion disks with a random distribution of inclinations will be equal to that of @xmath34 system ) . a standard exponential decline",
    "was then assumed .",
    "the time after outburst corresponding to each @xmath32 was calculated using    @xmath35    we also performed the analysis using a very simple optical decline of    @xmath36    which had very little effect on the final results .",
    "we then calculated how the luminosity red - ward of the lyman limit , @xmath37 , declined over time for each @xmath5 value .",
    "assuming the nova emits as a black body ( although this is a first approximation for our purposes - see @xcite ) , we integrated the black body function to find the luminosity red - ward of the lyman limit that is received by the nucleation sites at a given time , @xmath37 .    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is radius of the pseudo - photosphere .",
    "figure [ fig : luminosity ] shows @xmath37 against @xmath40 for various @xmath5 values .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that , as expected , @xmath37 drops much faster for faster novae .",
    "for example , potential dust formation sites in a @xmath41 days nova see more central source luminosity at @xmath42 days than potential sites in a @xmath43 days nova do at the same epoch , despite the constant bolometric luminosity being higher for the faster nova .    days ( highest initial luminosity ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45  days ( lowest initial luminosity ) .",
    "the bottom plot shows the same , but expressed as a ratio of the total luminosity produced by a nova with a given @xmath19 value , with @xmath46  days being the fastest declining and @xmath45  days being the slowest.[fig : luminosity],title=\"fig : \" ]  days ( highest initial luminosity ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45  days ( lowest initial luminosity ) .",
    "the bottom plot shows the same , but expressed as a ratio of the total luminosity produced by a nova with a given @xmath19 value , with @xmath46  days being the fastest declining and @xmath45  days being the slowest.[fig : luminosity],title=\"fig : \" ]    as part of the revised theoretical exploration , we have considered different types of grain material , for example using data from @xcite . in terms of the size of nucleation centres",
    "we assume that c@xmath47 as a nucleation centre acts as a solid sphere , where grain radius , @xmath48  nm ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a mie theory code was run to generate @xmath49 values for a range of grain sizes from @xmath50  nm over @xmath51 m for a condensation temperature , @xmath11 , of 1200  k ( appropriate for graphite in a 1:1 ratio c : o environment ; @xcite ) .",
    "absorption efficiencies at longer wavelengths were found by extrapolation .",
    "we chose to explore results for graphite and ach2 ( amorphous carbon is thought to form in h - rich environments , @xcite ) , although the formation of spherical nucleation centres is of course less likely in the case of graphite .",
    "the results showed that , as expected in the rayleigh regime , @xmath52 .",
    "we then calculated the planck mean emission for graphite as    @xmath53    and that for ach2 as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the temperature of the grains ( in kelvin ) and @xmath56 is in cm in each case .",
    "these planck means are not valid over all temperatures , but sufficient for these calculations ( i.e. they easily cover the range around 1200  k - the planck mean for graphite is valid over the temperature range of approximately 500  k to 4000  k , with that of ach2 being valid approximately between 500  k and 2000  k ) .",
    "thus , considering the energy balance between absorbed and emitted energy by a nucleation site for graphite @xmath57^{0.18 } \\label{equ : graphite}\\ ] ] and for ach2 @xmath58^{0.22}. \\label{equ : ach2}\\ ] ] we solved equation ( [ equ : ach2 ] ) numerically for dust condensation temperatures in the range of 1000  k to 1400  k and solved equation ( [ equ : graphite ] ) numerically for @xmath59  k for reference .",
    "we have compared the predicted @xmath60 relationships from the above model with the data produced by @xcite using their observations and those of references therein .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : speeddust ] , with additional points added for v1425  aql @xcite , v1280  sco @xcite , v5579  sgr @xcite , v496  sct @xcite and nova cep  2013 @xcite .",
    "the graphite and ach2 relationships shown in the figure were produced by performing the numerical integration described at the end of section [ sec : lym ] over a range of @xmath5 values .        as can be seen from figure [ fig : speeddust ] ,",
    "the results for both graphite and ach2 appear to agree well with the general trend of @xmath4 with @xmath19 from the observations , despite the simplistic assumptions made .",
    "there do not appear to be great differences between the relationships for the two types of carbon .",
    "the shaded area of the figure displays the relationship for ach2 for @xmath11 between 1000  k and 1400  k. this shows that the relationship holds well for a range of @xmath11 .",
    "we note that many specific data points at the lower @xmath19 values lie outside our relationship , but this reflects the simplicity of our model and the variation in parameters , including specific dust grain types , expected for individual nova outbursts .",
    "it can also be seen in figure  [ fig : speeddust ] , that there is a gap in observational data between 100 @xmath61 @xmath19 @xmath61 200 .",
    "we note of course that the extreme case , v445 pup , is an unusual helium nova",
    ". the apparent gap may however be due to the relative rarity of novae of these slow speed classes , and furthermore not every nova being observed sufficiently systematically at such late times to detect the epoch of dust formation .",
    "overall , our results can be used to predict when dust will form in a nova of a given speed class and hence when , for example , infrared observations should be taken to detect the onset of dust formation .",
    "the only known dust - forming nova where carbon - based dust has not been observed is qu  vul , where sio@xmath62 dust was formed ( @xmath63 days and @xmath64 days ; @xcite ) , although this nova still appears to match our theoretical relationships for carbon - based dust .",
    "several novae have been observed to form both carbon - rich and oxygen - rich dust @xcite , although the dust in co novae is thought to consist mainly of amorphous carbon grains @xcite . as a future step",
    "it would be feasible to conduct a similar analysis for silicates , although these form later than carbon - rich dust where both types are formed in the same nova @xcite .",
    "similarly , the application of more realistic spectral energy distributions for the emission seen by the grains , and any effects of re - emission of photons within the clumps , plus the effects of non - spherical geometry ( e.g.  @xcite ) should be explored .",
