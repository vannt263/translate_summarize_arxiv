    "the antimatter - matter asymmetry is an active area of physics adressing fundamental questions concerning the evolution of the universe , the validity of the cpt symmetry and gravitational differences between matter and antimatter @xcite .",

    "the recent advances in the field of antimatter include the production and trapping of antihydrogen @xcite as well as cooling to a stable electronic state @xcite .",
    "antihydrogen is one of the simplest examples of an atomic system composed of antimatter .",

    "examples of such many body systems includes , e.g. , antihydrogen - hydrogen @xcite , antiprotonic helium @xcite and various antiproton - gas collisions investigated by the asacusa collaboration in the antiproton collisional kinetic energy regime of 2 - 11 kev @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have investigated the collision an antiproton ( @xmath1 ) with molecular hydrogen as a model system for more complex antiparticle - molecular interactions .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath1 system is interesting from a practical point of view as residual @xmath3 gas exists in most high energy colliders , and antiprotons are created in various experiments , resulting in scattering of antiprotons on @xmath3 molecules @xcite .",
    "previous work on this system focused on the high - energy @xcite and the low - energy collision region investigating antiproton and proton cross sections for ionization and excitation of hydrogen molecules as well as energy spectra of the ionized electrons@xcite .    in previous work the influence of collisions in the energy regime above 100ev was investigated which mainly leads to ionized reaction products @xcite .",
    "however , the ultra low energy regime below 10ev @xcite opens up a new regime of matter - antimatter chemistry , since this energy is comparable to the chemical bond energy . in this region the molecular hydrogen is vibrationally excited , but remains in its electronic ground state .",
    "the antiproton behaves like another nucleus in the molecular system , whereas its negative charge produces an interaction potential , which is on the order of magnitude of an electronic state in an atom .    in this paper",

    "the ground state of the @xmath2-@xmath1 system is separated by more than 5ev from the first excited state , which can be seen from fig . [",
    "fig : pes ] , and thus the effect of non - adiabatic couplings can be neglected if the @xmath2 is initially in its electronic ground state .",
    "we notice , however , that the excited states @xmath27 and @xmath82 of the coupled system show clearly a region of curve crossing ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pes](b ) ) , which needs to be taken in consideration for higher collision energies . in a three body system",

    "in contrast to a tri - atomic molecule the @xmath2-@xmath1 ground state is expected to be several kev deep @xcite due to the mass of the antiproton ( compared to an electron ) .",
    "its determination and investigation however is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the analysis of the vibrational distribution of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ probdistfig ] ) shows a clear threshold in collision energy below which the reaction products are mainly in the vibrational ground state .",
    "this threshold value is between 0.28 and 0.63ev and is consistent with the the first vibrational excitation of @xmath2 at @xmath83ev @xcite .",
    "however , the distribution has a slight asymmetry between the reflected and transmitted part at 0.28ev .",
    "this indicates that the slightly longer interaction time for the reflected part allows coupling of some of the antiproton s kinetic energy into the @xmath2 mode . for collision energies beyond 3.4ev",
    "the vibrational distribution becomes more spread out , which can be explained by the anharmonicity of the @xmath2 : at higher collision energy more vibrational levels become accessible . here",
    "the mean vibrational quantum number @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vmean ] ) provides a more clear picture .",
    "the increase in @xmath84 is close to a linear behavior for collision energies below 4ev . a comparison with the energy of @xmath85 ( 2.9ev ) and the collision energy leads to the conclusion that approximately 90% of the antiprotons kinetic energy is converted into vibrational energy .",
    "at a collision energy of @xmath86 6ev the @xmath2 begins to dissociate ( fig .",
    "[ dissociationfig ] ) .",
    "however at least 8ev is necessary to dissociate about 10% of the @xmath2 .",
    "compared with the dissociation energy of 4.52 ev of @xmath2 this is a remarkable excess of energy which is needed to induce the @xmath2 dissociation .",
    "this indicates that the coupling between the antiproton mode and the @xmath2 mode becomes more inefficient with increasing collision energy .",
    "such effects have been observed in other reactive scattering systems in the form of a dynamical barrier @xcite . a simple explanation for this phenomena could be provided by the fact , that the interaction time between the @xmath2 and the antiproton becomes shorter at higher velocities and reduces the effective time to transfer energy between the modes .",
    "to describe the dynamics of an antiproton colliding with a hydrogen molecule the electronic pes of the ground state as well as for the five lowest excited states were first computed .",
    "the quantum chemical calculations show that it is enough to include the ground state pes to describe the dynamics in the ultra low energy regime considered here . for higher collision energies it might be necessary to include non - adiabatic couplings , as indicated by the curve crossings between the excited states .",
    "the possibilities of finding conical intersection instead of avoided crossings , compared to bare @xmath2 , is an exciting example of non - conventional conical intersections .",
    "a thorough analysis will be conducted in a future paper .",
    "the results of the wave packet dynamics give insight into the energy redistribution during the collision . for energies below the dissociation threshold",
    "the scattering event leaves a clear signature in the vibrational distribution of the @xmath2 system .",
    "the vibrational excitations are in accordance with the @xmath2 vibrational states .",
    "the system has a clear threshold with respect to dissociation .",
