    "for low ( large ) susy parameter scale we found the maximal value @xmath238 ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "the dependence of the results on the neutrino mass pattern is weak .",
    "the magnetic moments @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 were calculated also as a function of the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "the best fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters were considered . only for the mixing angle @xmath132 it was assumed @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the maximal mixing of atmospheric neutrinos ( @xmath242 ) implies that the allowed ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the same , if the dirac and majorana cp violating phases vary from 0 to @xmath123 .",
    "the results show that especially @xmath243 ( inverted hierachy of neutrino masses ) depends strongly on the values of cp phases .",
    "the obtained results show that the values of the majorana transition magnetic moments might be significantly above the scale of the dirac - type magnetic moment in minimal extension of the sm with right - handed neutrinos",
    ". however , the maximal values are still too small to be tested in the present laboratory experiments or to have astrophysical consequences .    *",
