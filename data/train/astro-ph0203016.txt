    "standard models for the formation of a single , low - mass star begin with a slowly rotating cloud of gas and dust with a centrally concentrated density distribution ( e.g. , larson 1969 , 1972 ; stahler , shu , & taam 1980 , 1981 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . when the inward gravitational pressure exceeds the outward thermal and magnetic pressures , the cloud collapses .",
    "material near the axis of rotation with low specific angular momentum contracts into a central star - like core .",
    "once the radius of the centrifugal barrier exceeds the radius of the central stellar core , material away from the rotation axis with large specific angular momentum follows a curved infall trajectory , falls onto the equatorial plane , and forms a circumstellar disk @xcite . as the collapse proceeds , the protostellar core becomes more massive and more luminous ; the surrounding infalling envelope becomes less massive and less opaque at optical and infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "eventually , a wind from the star - disk system begins to clear gas and dust away from the rotational axis , resulting in the production of collimated jets and a bipolar molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "once the infalling envelope disperses or falls into the circumstellar disk , the central star - disk system becomes optically visible as a pre - main - sequence star . as the material in the disk accretes onto the the central star , dissipates , or condenses into planets , the star moves onto the main sequence @xcite .",
    "this picture of star formation generally accounts for an apparent evolutionary sequence in the observed properties of young stars in nearby molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite describes three of the classes in this sequence .",
    "class i sources have spectral energy distributions ( seds ) which are broader than a single temperature blackbody function and rise from @xmath1 m to @xmath2 m .",
    "class i sources are star - disk systems still surrounded by massive infalling envelopes .",
    "the envelope absorbs optical and near - infrared photons from the central protostar and re - emits this radiation at far - ir and mm wavelengths where the envelope is optically thin .",
    "class ii sources also have broad seds , but the sed falls from @xmath1 m to @xmath2 m .",
    "these sources contain a pre - main - sequence star surrounded by a circumstellar disk , which absorbs and reradiates emission from the central star .",
    "class iii sources have roughly blackbody seds that peak at @xmath0 1 @xmath3 m ; radiation from a surrounding disk or envelope contributes negligible emission at 10100 @xmath3 m ( lada 1991 ) .",
    "@xcite added the class 0 sources to this sequence to include very young objects at the beginning of the accretion process .",
    "these objects have narrow seds which peak at @xmath0 100300 @xmath3 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in the current picture , the central star of a class 0 source has accumulated @xmath4 50% of its final mass ; in class i sources , the central star has @xmath5 50% of its final mass .",
    "the taurus - auriga cloud is one of the best sites for testing models of isolated , low mass star formation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this collection of filamentary clouds contains good samples of class i , ii , and iii pre - main sequence stars , a class 0 source , and several examples of interesting transition objects .",
    "the clouds are close enough ( d = 140 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to allow high signal - to - noise observations at all wavelengths with moderate to high spectral and spatial resolution .",
    "although the clouds are poor examples of clustered star formation , pre - main sequence stars in taurus - auriga provide interesting constraints on the formation of small close groups of pre - main sequence stars @xcite .    here , we consider a comparison between the millimeter ( mm ) and near - infrared ( near - ir ) properties of class i sources in taurus - auriga .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that moderate spatial resolution mm continuum observations divide these objects into unresolved , point - like sources with negligible infalling envelopes , extended sources with significant infalling envelopes , and several transition objects with modest infalling envelopes . in this division , the unresolved taurus - auriga sources might be edge - on disks similar to those discovered in hh30 irs and hk tau @xcite . because the derived lifetimes in each evolutionary phase depend on the relative numbers of objects in each phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this uncertainty is comparable to the range in the zero - points and airmass corrections for the hk filters on each observing run . adding the calibration error in quadrature with the standard deviations of the source data yields a typical photometric error of less than 0.05 mag in each filter .    to measure morphological information from the individual and coadded frames , we use sextractor @xcite .",

    "these objects thus appear older , with smaller extended envelopes and less accretion activity than the protostars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "there are several exceptions to this statement .",
    "four sources  04158 + 2805 , 04260 + 2642 , 04264 + 2433 , and 04489 + 3042  have [ s  ii ] emission ; 04264 + 2433 has large near - ir polarization ; near - ir spectra of 04295 + 2251 and 04489 + 3042 more closely resemble spectra of class i sources than t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "this diversity of properties suggests that the peculiar class i sources do not belong to a single class of objects .",
    "table 2 lists our best estimates for the nature of these peculiar class i sources .",
    "we consider 04016 + 2610 , 04260 + 2612 ,",
    "04264 + 2433 , 04302 + 2247 as transition objects between class i and class ii .",
    "extended , highly polarized near - ir nebulae demonstrate that 04016 + 2610 and 04302 + 2247 are not class ii sources ; 04181 + 2655 , 04260 + 2612 and 04264 + 2433 have similar spectral energy distributions but no obvious near - ir nebulosity . the class i sources 04108 + 2803b , 04295 + 2251 , and 04489 + 3042 have larger optical to far - ir flux ratios than 04016 + 2610 and other ` transition candidates . '",
    "these sources could be transition objects viewed along the rotational axis of the disk .",
    "the strong [ s ii ] emission in 04295 + 2251 recalls similar emission in the edge - on disk systems hk tau and hh30 irs",
    ". finally , 04108 + 2803a and 04158 + 2805 are more similar to class ii sources and are probably heavily reddened t tauri stars .",
    "our near - ir observations provide a first detection of near - ir variability in a sample of class i protostars .",
    "the variations are similar in amplitude to those observed in t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the poor time coverage of the imaging data for this sample does not provide a useful measure of the timescale for these variations . if the variations are similar to those in t tauri stars , observations on successive nights over weeks or months can measure the timescales . as an example , @xcite derive an 8 day period for the variation in the becklin - neugebauer object , an embedded protostar in orion ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the near - ir morphologies of taurus - auriga class i sources are consistent with the mm continuum measurements of @xcite .",
    "most ( @xmath0 60% ) of these objects are true protostars , with massive envelopes surrounding a young star with @xmath0 50% of its final mass .",
    "some ( @xmath0 25% ) of the class i sources are probably transition objects between true protostars and optically visible t tauri stars ; one or two of these might have edge - on disks similar to those observed in hh30 irs and hk tau .",
    "two other class i sources are probably heavily reddened t tauri stars;.    making accurate classifications for the `` peculiar '' class i sources requires additional data .",
    "radio observations of some class i sources using higher spatial resolution might reveal compact nebulae or large disks as in 04016 + 2610 @xcite .",
    "deeper near - ir images may also reveal extended nebulosity .",
    "we have marginal detections of faint nebulosity on coadded near - ir images of 04181 + 2655 and 04264 + 2433 ; higher signal - to - noise observations might provide a better indication of the extended nature of these and other point - like class i sources .",
    "because molecular outflows and optical / near - ir jets are more common among class i sources and transition objects than among t tauri stars with class ii seds @xcite , deeper optical and near - ir surveys for jet emission and more extensive outflow surveys can also help to classify these objects .",
    "these new data would provide a better understanding of the evolution from class i to class ii among low mass protostars .",
    "finally , our results offer a new test of infall models for class i protostars . in the standard picture ,",
    "a massive envelope produces mm and far - ir continuum emission ; near - ir and optical radiation from the central object escape through the optically thin outflow cavity .",
    "as the infalling envelope becomes less massive and less opaque , the angular size of the outflow cavity should shrink . because optical and near - ir radiation can escape the envelope more easily",
    ", protostars should become less elongated as the optical depth through the envelope decreases .",
    "our near - ir morphological data confirm this expectation : @xmath31 and @xmath39 of class i sources correlate with @xmath42 .",
    "the standard model also predicts a general anti - correlation between the near - ir measurements @xmath31 and @xmath39 and the mm measurement @xmath37 of @xcite . as the envelope mass declines , the unresolved central star and the disk produce more of the mm continuum flux ; sources thus become more concentrated at mm wavelengths as they become less elongated and less extended at optical and near - ir wavelengths . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", however , theoretical radiative transfer models of protostars do not make specific predictions for the variation of @xmath31 or @xmath39 as a function of @xmath37 or @xmath42 .",
    "our results demonstrate that near - ir and mm continuum data can test these predictions .",
