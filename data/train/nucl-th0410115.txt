    "in the last decade , the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method has been developed into a powerful tool for calculations of light nuclei ( so far up to @xmath5  =  12 ) using realistic two - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) and three - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) potentials .",
    "gfmc starts with a trial wave function that is obtained via variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and projects out excited state contamination to , in principle , obtain the true ground - state wave function for the given hamiltonian . in practice",
    "the method obtains ground and low - lying excited state energies with an accuracy of 12% . a review of the nuclear vmc and gfmc methods up to @xmath5  =  8 may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath5  =  9,10 results are in ref .  @xcite . by using the argonne @xmath2 @xmath0 potential ( av18 ) and including two- and three - pion exchange @xmath1 potentials , a series of model hamiltonians ( the illinois models )",
    "were constructed  @xcite that give a good reproduction of energies for @xmath5  =  3 to 12 .",
    "recently gfmc has been extended to the calculation of multiple excited states with the same quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "this paper reviews some of these results and compares gfmc energies to no - core shell model ( ncsm ) results  @xcite for several cases . a recent study showing that an experimental claim of a bound tetraneutron is very unlikely to be valid  @xcite is also reprised .",
    "finally some on - going work involving spectroscopic factors , neutron - rich oxygen isotopes , and difficulties in gfmc computation of rms radii is presented .",
    "our hamiltonian includes a nonrelativistic one - body kinetic energy , the argonne @xmath2 ( av18 ) two - nucleon potential @xcite and various three - nucleon potentials , @xmath6 the difference between proton and neutron masses is included in our calculations , but ignored above .",
    "the argonne @xmath2 potential is one of a number of accurate @xmath7 potential models developed since 1990 .",
    "it can be written as a sum of electromagnetic and one - pion - exchange terms and a shorter - range phenomenological part .",
    "the electromagnetic terms include one- and two - photon - exchange coulomb interactions , vacuum polarization , darwin - foldy , and magnetic moment terms , with appropriate proton and neutron form factors .",
    "the one - pion - exchange part contains the normal yukawa and tensor functions with a short - range cutoff .",
    "this and the remaining phenomenological part of the potential can be written as a sum of eighteen operators , which is where the name @xmath2 comes from .",
    "the first fourteen are charge - independent , and include spin - spin , tensor , @xmath8 , and quadratic-@xmath9 terms , each with a dependence on isospin . the last four operators break charge independence .",
    "the radial forms associated with each operator are determined by fitting @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "the potential was fit directly to the nijmegen @xmath0 scattering data base  @xcite , which contains 1787 @xmath10 and 2514 @xmath11 data in the range @xmath12 mev , with a @xmath13 per datum of 1.09 .",
    "it was also fit to the @xmath14 scattering length measured in @xmath15 experiments and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "the urbana series of three - nucleon potentials were developed to compute properties of @xmath16 nuclei and nuclear matter ; the current ( ninth ) model is designated uix  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are written as sums of two - pion - exchange with intermediate excitation of an isobar ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vijk ] ) and shorter - range phenomenological terms .",
    "the two - pion - exchange term is that of the original fujita - miyazawa model  @xcite and contains both spin ( tensor ) and isospin dependence .",
    "the shorter - range phenomenological term is purely central and repulsive .",
    "our recent work has shown the need for additional binding for @xmath17-shell nuclei and for further increased binding as @xmath18 increases .",
    "this led to the development of the illinois models @xcite which , in addition to the urbana terms , contain the two - pion @xmath19-wave scattering term ( second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vijk ] ) and three - pion exchange ring terms ( last two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : vijk ] ) .",
    "the latter can involve the excitation of one or two sequential isobars , so that each energy denominator contains only one @xmath20 mass .    in light nuclei",
    "we find that the three - nucleon potential contributes only 2 - 9% ( increasing with @xmath5 ) of the total potential energy .",
    "however , due to the large cancellation of potential and kinetic energy , this amounts to 15 - 50% ( increasing mostly with @xmath21 ) of the binding energy .",
    "we expect a similar ratio for the four - body potential , which implies that it contributes only a few percent of the binding energy ; such contributions are close to our computational accuracy and would be absorbed in fit of the @xmath1 potential parameters .",
    "variational monte carlo finds an upper bound , @xmath22 , to an eigenenergy of @xmath23 by evaluating the expectation value of @xmath23 in a trial wave function , @xmath24 .",

    "gfmc calculations suffer significantly from the well - known fermion sign problem .",
    "this results in exponential growth of the statistical errors as one propagates to larger @xmath50 , or as @xmath5 is increased .",
    "for @xmath74 the resulting limit on @xmath50 is too small to allow convergence of the energy . in the last few years",

    "are discarded such that the average over all discarded configurations of @xmath76 is 0 .",
    "this means that , if @xmath24 were the true eigenstate , the discarded configurations would contribute nothing but noise to @xmath77 .",
    "this constrained propagation completely controls the growth of the statistical errors and in most cases produces a result that is statistically the same as unconstrained propagation ( the accuracy of the comparison may be limited by the statistical errors in the unconstrained result ) .",
    "however we have demonstrated some cases for which constrained propagation leads to a wrong result , and in fact for which the approximate @xmath78 is not even an upper bound to the correct eigenvalue . in all cases",
    "the correct result can be obtained by making a few ( 10 to 20 ) unconstrained steps before evaluating the energy .",

    "the av18+il2 result shown for @xmath3c was made using a simplified @xmath24 and an approximate treatment of @xmath71 in the gfmc propagation ; for these reasons it is marked preliminary .",

    "the parameters of the illinois-2 @xmath1 potential were adjusted to reproduce the energies of 17 narrow states for @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen the potential provides an excellent overall reproduction of the energies of many states up to the ground state of @xmath3c ; the rms error in reproducing the experimental energies of the 39 states with width @xmath108  mev is 0.7  mev .",
    "figure [ fig : estar ] shows excitation spectra of nuclei .",

    "the @xmath1 potential increases the predicted splittings of several spin - orbit partners , such as the @xmath109,@xmath110,@xmath111 triplet in @xmath4li and the first @xmath112 and @xmath102 levels in @xmath101li which significantly improves the agreement with experiment .",
    "a variational study of @xmath113n also showed that a large part of the spin - orbit splitting in that nucleus is a result of the @xmath1 potential  @xcite .",
    "however the most dramatic effect of the @xmath1 potential on levels appears in @xmath81b .",
    "the av18 hamiltonian results in two @xmath111 levels being below the @xmath109 state which is the experimental ground state ; the av18+il2 hamiltonian gives the correct order .",
    "a similar inversion of levels occurs for the @xmath102 and @xmath114 states in @xmath115be .",
    "these inversions are also due to increased spin - orbit strength from the @xmath1 potential ; in 1956 kurath showed that the position of the @xmath81b(3@xmath116 ) state depends sensitively on spin - orbit strength  @xcite .",
    "another level ordering that is correct only with the @xmath1 potential is shown in @xmath81be . here ,",
    "as can be inferred from the experimental @xmath117 s to the ground state , the first @xmath110 level should have a large negative quadrupole moment and the second should have a positive quadrupole moment .",
    "this is the case for the full av18+il2 hamiltonian but without il2 the energies of these states are reversed .",

    "it uses an expansion in a large harmonic - oscillator basis for all @xmath5 nucleons .",
    "effective two- and three - body interactions are constructed from the bare @xmath119 ; bare @xmath71 can also be included in the three - body effective interactions .",
    "the construction of the effective interactions also gives a unique prescription for constructing effective operators from bare operators .",
    "the size of the harmonic - oscillator basis for a specified order of expansion grows rapidly with @xmath5 . at present 16@xmath120 can be used for @xmath121 with just two - body effective interactions ; this results in well - converged calculations .",
    "however only 8@xmath120 can be used for @xmath122 and two - body effective interactions and these calculations are not fully converged .",
    "calculations with three - body effective interactions are limited to 6@xmath120 and are generally not converged . for a complete description of this method see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the ncsm is much faster than gfmc but because of these limits on the basis size appears to be less accurate than gfmc , especially when a @xmath1 potential is being used .",

    ". the right - hand two bars shows results with the tm@xmath118(99 ) @xmath1 potential  @xcite added to av8@xmath118 . in this case",
    "the ncsm results are significantly above those from gfmc ; that is the ncsm appears to not get the full additional attraction provided by tm@xmath118(99 ) .",
    "this is probably because of the limitation to only 6@xmath120 when using the three - body effective interaction .",
    "an experimental claim of the existence of a bound tetraneutron cluster ( @xmath72n ) was made recently  @xcite .",
    "this prompted our study  @xcite of the theoretical possibility of such a state ; the conclusion was that a bound tetraneutron is strongly excluded by modern nuclear hamiltonians .",
    "as a first step , negative - energy @xmath72n solutions using the av18+il2 model were searched for ; gfmc calculations , using propagation to very large imaginary time ( @xmath123  mev@xmath59 ) , produced only positive energies that steadily decreased as the rms radius of the system increased . adding artificial external wells to the hamiltonian can , of course , produce negative energies . by varying the well depth",
    ", one can extrapolate to zero - well depth .",
    "such calculations suggest that there might be a @xmath72n resonance near + 2  mev , but since the gfmc calculation with no external well shows no indication of stabilizing at that energy , the resonance , if it exists at all , must be very broad .    to study the possibility that a minor modification of the av18+il2 model could result in binding of @xmath72n , a number of modifications to the av18+il2 model were made .",
    "in each case the modification was adjusted to bind @xmath72n with an energy of approximately @xmath124  mev ; the consequences of this modification for other nuclei were then computed .",

    "as is shown by the bars labeled @xmath125 in the figure , this results in substantial overbinding of @xmath127h , @xmath72he and all other nuclei that were computed .",
    "in addition it results in a bound dineutron ; in fact the @xmath72n is not really bound as it can decay into two dineutrons .",

    "a @xmath1 potential that acts only in @xmath131 triples would have the same effect on @xmath72n as one with no isospin dependence , but would have no effect on @xmath127h and @xmath72he because they contain only @xmath132 triples .",
    "such a potential was added to the av18+il2 hamiltonian , and the coupling constant chosen to produce @xmath72n with @xmath133  mev energy .",
    "it turns out that the coupling must be quite large to produce the minimally bound @xmath72n .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "if a modified @xmath0 potential is used to bind @xmath72n , the pairs can sequentially come close enough to feel the attraction ; this allows the four neutrons to be in a diffuse , large radius , distribution .",
    "however a @xmath1 potential requires three neutrons to simultaneously be relatively close and thus the density of the system must be much higher .",
    "indeed the rms radii of the @xmath72n for the modified @xmath1 potential is only 1.9  fm while the rms radius for @xmath134 produced by the modified @xmath0 potential is 10  fm .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4n_rho ] shows the corresponding densities .",
    "the right panel compares the pair distributions for the two different @xmath72n systems with that of the dineutron made by the modified @xmath0 potential .",
    "the @xmath135 pairs in the @xmath72n made by the modified @xmath0 potential are basically undisturbed @xmath129n pairs , while the modified @xmath1 potential results in very different @xmath129n pairs .    the small radius of the @xmath72n bound by the modified @xmath1 potential results in a kinetic energy that is an order of magnitude more than for the @xmath72n bound by the modified @xmath125 potential .",
    "this large kinetic energy must be overcome by a large @xmath1 potential energy , and hence a large coupling constant is required .",
    "the very large coupling constant for the extra @xmath1 term means that it has a large , even catastrophic , effect on any nuclear system in which it can act .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4n ] by the bars labeled @xmath71 ; for example the binding energy of @xmath4li is doubled and that of @xmath4he is tripled . as stated above , this potential has no effect on @xmath127h or @xmath72he .",
    "however the most dramatic result of this potential is that every investigated pure neutron system with @xmath136 is extremely bound and in fact is the most stable `` nucleus '' of that a ; the @xmath4n energy is off the scale of the figure at -650  mev !    a four - nucleon potential that acts in only @xmath137 quadruples was also constructed to weakly bind @xmath72 ; it has even more devastating consequences for nuclei in which it can act than the @xmath1 potential .",
    "thus an experimental observation of a bound tetraneutron would not be a minor perturbation to our understanding of nuclei ; the experimental evidence for such a claim should be very strong before it is taken seriously .",
    "recently a group at argonne has measured the rms charge radius of the radioactive nucleus @xmath4he ( @xmath138-decay halflife 0.8 sec . ) with the remarkable accuracy of 0.7%  @xcite .",
    "this prompted us to revisit our already published  @xcite proton rms radius for @xmath4he .",
    "that calculation had been made with our standard propagation to @xmath139  mev@xmath59 and had produced a value in excellent agreement with the new experimental value .",
    "we made new calculations to much larger @xmath50 and found that there are very slow fluctuations of the rms radius with @xmath50 .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmsr ] which contains a gfmc propagation to @xmath140mev@xmath59 for @xmath4he using the av18+il2 hamiltonian .",
    "the upper panel shows the energy on a highly magnified scale ; the results show just monte carlo statistical fluctuations with no long - term correlations .",
    "the standard error of the mean that is extracted from these numbers is thus reliable .",
    "however the rms point proton radius shown in the lower panel has extremely long - range correlations making the error of the mean a useless number .",
    "we do not understand the origin of these fluctuations and have been unable to reduce them by using different importance sampling methods in the gfmc propagation . at the moment",
    "all we can do is report the average shown in the figure and use the extrema of the fluctuations as an estimate of the error ; after folding in the proton and neutron rms radii , this is reported in table  [ table : rms ] as a charge radius . as can be seen our computed value",
    "is significantly above the experimental value .",
    "we have also made a large-@xmath50 calculations of the rms radii of @xmath72he and @xmath80he .",
    "the @xmath72he calculation shows no long - term fluctuations and that of @xmath80he shows substantially smaller fluctuations than for @xmath4he .",
    "these results are also reported in the table .",

    "the ti wave functions were made by expressing the oscillator wave functions in terms of @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a nucleon coordinate and @xmath143 is the center of mass of all @xmath5 or @xmath5 - 1 nucleons .",
    "the oscillator parameter for the @xmath19-shell gives a good rms radius for @xmath72he .",
    "this same parameter is used for the @xmath17-shell in the first line and results in very small @xmath101li rms radii . in this case",
    "the full @xmath144 ratio of ti to fc spectroscopic factors is observed , as is required by eq .",
    "( [ fcti ] ) . in the next two lines ,",
    "the @xmath17-shell oscillator parameter is increased until reasonable @xmath101li radii are achieved ; this results in significantly reduced ti / fc ratios .",
    "the two lines labeled `` correlated '' report results from modified vmc wave functions which can be expressed in either the fc or ti . these have the structure of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : psit]-[phi_a ] ) but also include one - body wave functions for the @xmath31-core nucleons . here",
    "we see ti / fc ratios near 1 or even less than 1 .",
    "the line labeled `` vmc '' shows the ti results for our full variational wave function ; this wave function has no useful fc form .",
    "based on these results it seems better to make no conversion of a fc spectroscopic factor computed with just a @xmath17-shell shell model , rather than increase it by @xmath144 .",
    "we are continuing to study this .",
    "although gfmc is limited to light nuclei , it can be used to indirectly study large , neutron - rich , nuclei by computing neutron drops .",
    "these are collections of neutrons interacting via a realistic hamiltonian , such as av18+il2 , with the addition of an artificial external one - body well .",
    "the well provides the additional attraction necessary to produce a bound state of the @xmath145 neutrons ; it can be thought of as the average effect of the protons which are not explicitly included in the calculation .",
    "note that the @xmath145 neutrons occupy all shells from 0@xmath19 up ; the well does not represent any omitted neutrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : ndrops ] shows results for one such study in which we attempt to mimic the neutron - rich isotopes of oxygen .",
    "here we consider that the @xmath145-neutron drop represents @xmath146o .",
    "the external well is of the woods - saxon form with parameters @xmath147 fm , @xmath148 fm , and @xmath149 mev ; these were chosen in an attempt to get the correct separation energies for @xmath150o . since the energy of the 8 protons is not included in the calculation , the energies of all the neutron drops",
    "are shifted ( by 19 mev ) to match the 8-neutron drop with the experimental @xmath151o energy .",
    "the woods - saxon well binds 0@xmath19 and 0@xmath17 nucleons but does not have 0@xmath152 or 1@xmath19 bound states ; thus the binding of neutrons in the @xmath153 shell arises from the combination of the well and the intrinsic av18+il2 potentials .",
    "we see that the energies of the neutron - rich oxygen isotopes up to @xmath154o are reasonably well reproduced by this model .",
    "however the 9-neutron drop has a @xmath155 ground state rather than the desired @xmath156 .",
    "it appears necessary to add a spin - orbit term to the well to achieve the correct ground state .",
    "once a satisfactory model has been produced , the densities and other properties of these model oxygen isotopes can be studied .",
    "calculations with errors of only 1 to 2% of energies for nuclei from @xmath5 = 6 to 12 for a given hamiltonian are now possible .",
    "the av18+il2 hamiltonian gives average binding - energy errors @xmath157 mev for @xmath158 .",
    "a three - nucleon potential is required to obtain sufficient binding in the @xmath17-shell ; it is also required to reproduce many experimental spin - orbit splittings and several level orderings .",
    "the gfmc and vmc wave functions can be used to study many other nuclear properties ."
