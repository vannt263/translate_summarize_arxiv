    "the standard concordance cosmological model with cold dark matter ( @xmath3cdm model ) is remarkably successful on scales larger than @xmath4 mpc , but it faces challenges on smaller scales . for instance , it seems that the theory predicts a too cuspy density profile for the dark matter at the centres of galaxies ( e.g. , trachternach et al .",
    "the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposed by milgrom ( 1983 ) has proven to be successful in reproducing the kinematics of spiral galaxies without any assumption of unseen matter ( see sanders & mcgaugh 2002 , for a review ) , from extremely low mass galaxies of low surface brightness ( milgrom & sanders 2006 ) to high luminosity galaxies ( sanders & noordermeer 2007 ) .",

    "( 2007 ) found that the observed rotation curves in tidal dwarf galaxies are quite naturally explained without any free parameters within mond , and are inconsistent with the current @xmath3cdm theory ( see also kroupa et al .",
    "if mond is able to naturally account for all of the discrepancies faced by @xmath3cdm on small scales , this would lend strong support to mond .    in the newtonian dark matter scenario ,",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph s ) require the largest mass - to - light ratios . hence , dsph s provide a unique testing ground for the nature of dark matter and its alternatives ( gerhard & spergel 1992 ; milgrom 1995 ; lokas et al .",

    "however , the mass - to - light ratios inferred in mond are very sensitive to uncertainties on the structural parameters , luminosities , distances and internal velocity dispersions .",
    "it is , therefore , important to explore other gravitational effects , which , in principle , may offer independent tests .    in the dark matter paradigm ,",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles of the brightest dsphs are consistent with both a cuspy nfw halo and a cored dark halo .",
    "however , there exists some indirect evidence that dsph galaxies may possess a core ( kleyna et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter k03 ; goerdt et al .  2006 ; snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "in particular , k03 considered the survival of the cold density substructure detected in photometric data in ursa minor ( umi ) .",
    "this substructure appears as an off - centre localized stellar clump with low velocity dispersion @xmath5 km s@xmath6 .",
    "k03 concluded that the secondary peak in umi is a long - lived structure , surviving in phase - space because the underlying gravitational potential is close to harmonic . in the standard dark matter paradigm , this implies that the dark matter halo in umi must have a large core because , if the dark halo has a central density cusp , the clump should have diluted in @xmath7 gyr .",
    "even if dsph galaxies are influenced to some degree by the tidal forces exerted by the milky way , it is unlikely that such a large core may have a tidal origin ( e.g. , stoehr et al .",
    "2002 ; hayashi et al .  2003 ; pearrubia et al .",
    "it is worthwhile exploring if the competing mond scenario can explain the survival of cold substructures in dsph galaxies in a natural way .",
    "the question that arises is whether the mond gravitational potential can mimic the potential of a dark halo with a core in order to explain the very longevity of the dynamical fossil in umi .",
    "in other words , can the inference of cored haloes in dsphs be accomodated naturally within mond ?",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : tidalradius ] , we give a general statement of the problem and outline some key analytic results for tidal dissolution of satellite systems . in section [ sec : umidm ] ,",

    "( [ eq : kingtidalc ] ) is also valid in mond as long as @xmath13 is taken as the ratio between the `` true '' baryonic masses of the satellite and the host galaxy ( see snchez - salcedo & hernandez 2007 for a discussion ) .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kingtidalc ] ) that it may happen that the clump is essentially unbound ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , but it is not dissolved because @xmath18 . this is true in both newtonian and mond gravity .",
    "the case @xmath19 corresponds to the harmonic potential .",
    "if the potential is quasi - harmonic , the orbital period depends weakly on the energy of the stars and hence the phase mixing is highly suppressed even if self - gravity of the clump is ignored .",
    "much of early work on the dynamics of unbound satellites used the epicycle theory to describe their evolution ( e.g. , oort 1965 ; wielen 1977 ; fellhauer & heggie 2005 ) . from the linear epicyclic theory",
    ", we learn that it is possible to prepare a small unbound system with a nonzero velocity dispersion that will orbit with almost no secular spreading ( e.g. , kuhn 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , in an idealized situation where all the stars of the clump have the same guiding centre , the clump would preserve its original size in the epicyclic approximation because the epicycle and orbital frequencies are the same for all stars .",
    "however , even if we start with a very idealized situation in which all the stars of the clump move on retrograde orbits resembling epicycles with a common guiding centre , self - gravity of the clump destroys the coherent stellar motions and the dissolution time is infinite only when the density of the clump is negligible .",
    "fellhauer & heggie ( 2005 ) studied the time of dissolution of such unbound stellar system , in newtonian gravity , as a function of its initial internal density and size .",
    "they found that a system orbiting within a galaxy modeled as an isothermal sphere , can survive for about @xmath20 galactic orbits only if it has a very low density ( @xmath21 of the background density ) and small radius ( @xmath22 of the orbital radius ) . for larger internal densities of the clump ,",

    "[ sec : a1 ] , we extend the theoretical analysis of fellhauer & heggie ( 2005 ) to mond gravity .",
    "we consider a small unbound clump orbiting on a circular orbit around the centre of a galaxy .",
    "it is shown that , because of the enhanced self - gravity in mond , the dissolution time of a certain unbound clump is shorter in mond than in its equivalent newtonian galaxy , that is , the newtonian galaxy ( the same distribution of stars plus additional dark matter ) which has the same `` dynamics '' as the mond galaxy .",

    "an inspection of the stellar isophlets in umi suggests that the secondary peak is unbound material because of its large angular size in the plane of the sky , as compared to the expected value for a bound cluster , and its bend in the isodensity contours , indicative of tidal disruption ( palma et al .",

    "this is not the case for the secondary peak in umi and , thus , it turns out that the clump is unbound at least in the dark matter scenario .",
    "since there is no evidence that the regions of density excess have stellar populations that differ from the main body of umi ( kleyna et al .",
    "1998 ) , the most plausible interpretation is that this density structure , or clump , is a disrupted stellar cluster ( k03 ; read et al .  2006 ; section [ sec : alternatives ] ) .",

    "the size of the clump does not increase along the axis perpendicular to the orbital plane , and remains dynamically cold in that direction ( @xmath80 km s@xmath6 ) .",

    "( [ eq : kingtidalc ] ) was derived for mond satellite systems embedded in _ isolated _ host galaxies .",
    "as it will become clear later , umi is affected by the galactic field and can not be treated as it was in isolation .    in mond framework , the gravitational potential describing the force acting on a star in umi obeys the modified poisson equation of bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 cm s@xmath91 is the universal acceleration constant of the theory and @xmath92 is the interpolating function which runs smoothly from @xmath93 at @xmath94 to @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",

    "a clump star feels the external acceleration created by the milky way ( @xmath98 ) , the acceleration generated by umi background stars ( @xmath103 ) and the acceleration generated by all the other stars of the clump ( @xmath104 ) . due to the non - linearity of the mond field equation ,",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath103 is altered by the gravitational field of the milky way , whereas @xmath104 is altered by both @xmath98 and @xmath103 .      only for very special configurations ( one - dimensional symmetry spherical",

    "thus , the evolution of the clump in mond resembles that in a purely newtonian galaxy with a dark halo having a core equal to @xmath139 , i.e.  a mass - follows - light model .",
    "since the core radius of the fictitious dark halo is almost equal to the clump s orbit , the group of stars is erased in a few crossing times .",
    "in other words , mond is not able to change significantly the shape of the gravitational potential within the orbit of the clump , at least not enough to generate a near - isochrone potential needed to guarantee the survival of the clump .",
    "since the destruction time roughly scales as the galactic crossing time for the clump , one can increase the longevity of the clump by decreasing the mass of umi if a lower mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population of umi is adopted .",
    "figure [ fig : lowvcc ] shows the evolution of the same clump if the body of the stars in umi has @xmath133 . the clump is diluted in @xmath155 gyr .",
    "even when using a @xmath29 value seven times smaller than the preferred mass - to - light ratio ( i.e.  @xmath156 ) and the clump is initialized with a velocity dispersion of @xmath157 km s@xmath6 , the group of stars dissolves in @xmath158 gyr ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lowvcc_extreme ] ) .",
    "values for the mass - to - light ratio below @xmath159 may be problematic because then umi may be too fragile to the process of tidal disruption .    similarly , the survival time can also be enhanced by assuming a larger value for the external field acceleration @xmath143 .",

    "the circular speed for this model was also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotationcurve ] .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath101 can not change significantly the disruption timescale .",

    "even if the clump is initially very compact ( a @xmath74 radius of @xmath75 pc ) , orbital phase mixing dilutes the overdensity structure within less than @xmath2 gyr in mond models .",
    "when self - gravity of the clump is included , a clump with an initial @xmath74 radius of @xmath75 pc remains too compact to explain its present appearance ( see fig .  [",

    ", we needed to adjust the initial one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "figures [ fig : ecc35 ] and [ fig : circ35 ] show the evolution of the clump ( assuming @xmath132 ) on a near radial orbit and on circular orbit as those described in section [ sec : nsg ] but including self - gravity in the refe approximation .",
    "the initial one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the clump is @xmath4 km s@xmath6 . although the disruption of the clump is slightly faster when the clump is on a near - radial orbit , dissolution of the clump occurs within @xmath0 gyr in both cases .",
    "when self - gravity is turned off , the cluster of stars is erased within @xmath41 gyr .    in order to gain more physical insight ,",
    "we will focus on the simulation with the clump on circular orbit .",
    "the clump can not be considered in isolation at any time because the mean internal acceleration due to mutual forces between the stars of the clump , @xmath163 , is initially @xmath164 and decreases in time as the stars of clump becomes more loosely bound .",
    "for instance , @xmath163 averaged over all the simulated stars is @xmath165 at @xmath166 gyr . in fig .  [",
    "fig : boost ] , the mond boost factor @xmath167 at @xmath166 gyr is plotted as a function of the distance to clump s centre .",
    "once a star has been stripped away from the clump , at distances @xmath168 pc , it feels a constant boost factor and its dynamics is newtonian but with a larger effective newton constant @xmath169 .",
    "all the particles lie in the quasi - newtonian regime when the clump is erased .",
    "newtonian conservation laws such as the the conservation of the total energy and total angular momentum are only preserved in the refe approximation when the dynamics of all the stars is quasi - newtonian . in order to quantify the degree of conservation in our simulations ,",
    "we have computed the net internal force @xmath170 ( being @xmath171 the particle mass ) summed over all the simulated particles and the total angular momentum .",
    "the net internal force fluctuates in time but it is always less than @xmath41 percent the characteristic background force @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the circular speed around umi at @xmath139 .",
    "the total angular momentum , on the other hand , increases by @xmath174 percent during the first gyr and by @xmath41 percent between @xmath4 gyr and @xmath82 gyr .",
    "therefore , the inspiraling of the clump from an initial radius of @xmath150 pc to @xmath175 pc at @xmath4 gyr ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : circ35 ] ) is not an artifact but the result of the gravitational transfer of angular momentum from the clump to the trailing tidal tail .",
    "we must also notice at this point that the density substructures displayed in the map at @xmath82 gyr do not have statistical significance , as fig .",
    "[ fig : circ35_ev ] demonstrates .",
    "a reduction of @xmath51 leads to an increase of the crossing time of the clump around umi s centre but also the mass of the clump is lowered if we assume that the clump has the same @xmath51 as the background stars . for @xmath133 ( @xmath176 m@xmath56 ) ,",
    "the clump dissolves within @xmath0 gyr as well because clump s self - gravity is less relevant",
    ".    it may be worthwhile exploring whether the destruction timescale depends on the adopted value of the apocenter of the clump s orbit .",
    "for an apogalactic distance of @xmath177 pc , we find that the clump is erased in @xmath178 gyr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : standard750_1gyr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the persistence of the clump can not be accounted for by altering its orbital parameters .",
    "self - consistent simulations of the evolution of a low - mass satellite were carried out by kroupa ( 1997 ) and klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) .",
    "they found that the unbound distinguishable remnant , consisting of particles with phase - space characteristics that reduce spreading along the orbit as those described by kuhn ( 1993 ) , contains a mass of about @xmath179 of the initial mass of the progenitor . in the case of umi s clump , which has a mass of @xmath180 for @xmath132",
    ", the long - lived remnant should have a mass of @xmath181 , too small to be detected in our simulations .    in all our previous refe models ,",
    "the external acceleration was taken as constant and equal to the instantaneous external acceleration of umi at its current position .",
    "the external acceleration , however , may increase with time as umi orbit penetrates deeper into the milky way halo when it moves towards pericentre .",
    "piatek et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measured the proper motion for umi and found a perigalacticon and apogalacticon of @xmath182 kpc and @xmath183 kpc ( at @xmath184 confidence level ) , respectively .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : approximateefe ] ) , as umi plunges in on an eccentric orbit , it puffs up and expands adiabatically because @xmath142 gets smaller at larger external accelerations ( brada & milgrom 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the rotation timescale of the clump around umi slows .",
    "for the same reason , the self - gravity of the clump lowers and the clump also inflates , rendering itself more susceptible to tidal dissolution . in other words , when the strength of the external acceleration increases , the internal accelerations , @xmath142 and @xmath148 , decrease . in figure [ fig : circ35_aroundmw ] , we show snapshots of the surface density of the clump and its debris when umi is on a non - circular orbit with apogalacticon and perigalacticon at @xmath185 and @xmath186 kpc , respectively . for our mond value , @xmath187 km s@xmath6 , the orbital period of umi about the galactic centre is @xmath188 gyr . in this simulation ,",
    "umi was also initially located at a galactocentric distance of @xmath28 kpc and has negative velocity , i.e. , it is approaching to the galactic centre .",
    "the external acceleration increases until umi reaches pericentre after @xmath189 gyr . an obvious consequence of the adiabatic expansion of umi is that the orbit of the clump becomes more wide with time up to @xmath189 gyr .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : circ35_aroundmw ] ; the orbital radius is @xmath190 pc at @xmath166 gyr . by comparing figs  [ fig : circ35 ] and [ fig : circ35_aroundmw ]",
    ", we find that , at @xmath191 gyr , the clump is able to retain more mass in the simulation in which umi is placed on a non - circular orbit about the milky way but , still , the clump dissipates in @xmath192 gyr .",
    "we can safely establish that the varying external acceleration felt by the dwarf because of its orbital motion does not offer a promising solution to the survival problem of the clump .",
    "on the contrary , galactic tides , not included in our simulations , may help destroy the substructures if umi s orbit is very elongated ( say , perigalacticon at @xmath193 kpc ) .",
    "our simulations have assumed that the mass distribution of umi is spherical whereas the isophlets of umi have ellipticities of @xmath194 . since in mond the gravity comes solely from the stellar component , the potential should be flatter , not spherical .",
    "a perfectly spherical potential has orbits that are confined to lie on planes .",
    "by contrast , orbits in axisymmetric potentials generally show precession of their orbital planes ( except for exactly planar or exactly polar orbits ) , leading to an additional source of orbital mixing .",
    "we have explored whether a flattened mass distribution , such as that observed in umi , might change the slope of the rotation curve in the equatorial plane . in order to estimate this effect ,",
    "we have modeled the stellar bulk of umi as a flattened king model : @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the density profile of the spherical king model , and derived numerically the circular velocity ( see , e.g. ,  2.3 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) . at radii",
    "@xmath154 kpc , the umi rotation curve in the equatorial plane is again a scaled - version of the curve derived in the spherical case . if we adopt the same central volume mass density as in the spherical case , and a flattening of @xmath197 , the amplitude of the newtonian rotation curve decreases by a factor of @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , if the clump is on a radial orbit in the equatorial plane of umi , the inclusion of the ellipticity is similar to the use of a spherical model with @xmath199 . given the uncertainties in @xmath51 , this is a secondary effect and a more accurate treatment of the flattening is not yet justified by the observations .",
    "we conclude that the interpretation that the stellar clump is a dynamical fossil is difficult to sustain in mond because its lifetime is less than @xmath200 gyr even if clump s self - gravity is taken into account . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss other scenarios and potential problems .",
    "in section [ sec : survival ] , we consider the dissolution of an unbound clump , treating the background as a rigid potential . however , dynamical friction may induce a strong orbital decay of clusters in dsph galaxies .",
    "if the dark matter halo of umi follows a nfw profile , clusters of mass @xmath201 sink to the centre within one hubble time if they are initially placed within @xmath4 kpc from the dwarf galaxy centre ( e.g. , goerdt et al .",
    "2006 ; snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2006 ; pearrubia et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the case of mond",
    ", the orbital decay proceeds even faster ( snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2006 ; nipoti et al .",
    "a fully satisfactory scenario should explain simultaneously the survival of the clump against phase - mixing and against orbital decay .    in the dark matter scenario ,",
    "both problems are solved simultaneously if the dark matter halo has a core ( goerdt et al .",
    "2006 ; snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2006 ) . in mond",
    ", the clump can remain in orbit as long as its starting distance is large enough so that the dynamical friction force is highly suppressed due to the low stellar density of the background ( angus & diaferio 2009 ) .",
    "as already discussed , the clump can not survive against tidal diffusion even if its apocentre is placed at the tidal radius ( @xmath37 kpc ) , because the dissolution timescale depends on the gradients of the orbital frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath202 ) , which decay slowly with @xmath203 .",
    "it is important to consider other alternative scenarios for the presence of regions with cold density excess in dsph galaxies .",
    "it might be that the umi s clump is not a dynamical fossil but the disrupting remnant of a more massive globular cluster in the act of dispersing .",
    "although this possibility requires a very fine - tuning of the initial parameters of the globular cluster and circularity of its orbit , it might be viable if the dark matter halo is cuspy because the density of dark matter towards the galactic centre might be sufficient to create a strong tidal field able to disrupt a globular cluster of mass @xmath204 if it plunges close enough into the centre of the dwarf ( pearrubia et al  2009 ) .    in section [ sec : sgsimulations ] , we saw that a compact clump with initial @xmath74 radius of @xmath75 pc can not be disrupted by galactic tides .",
    "hence , a typical globular cluster of mass @xmath205 m@xmath56 is unaffected by the galactic tides in mond , even if the orbit brings the cluster to the centre of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "this is expected because the mean density of a typical globular cluster is higher than the mean density of a dsph galaxy .",
    "therefore , the clump could be a recently disrupted cluster which survived for a long time ( @xmath206 gyr ) due to being initially bound and _ more masive _",
    ", if the parameters of the clump progenitor were fine - tuned to be initially much more teneous and extended than a globular cluster .",
    "how massive should the progenitor be in this scenario ?",
    "the cluster will be subject to a prolonged and slow mass - loss regime before it suffers from a sharp tidal disruption .",
    "pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2009 ) and zhao ( 2004 ) find that cored stellar systems lose @xmath207 percent of its initial mass during the slow mass - loss regime .",
    "this implies that the progenitor should contain @xmath208 percent of the total mass of umi .",
    "clearly , this model presents severe inconsistencies because such a massive progenitor is expected to remain unaltered by tidal stirring .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to explain why this cluster did not sink to the galaxy centre .",
    "another related possibility is that the stellar overdensity is not a distinct identity but a portion of a stationary large - scale structure .",
    "for instance , density cusps may emerge in the projection of eccentric discs ( tremaine 1995 ) or in the projection of the tidal debris of a disrupted stellar cluster in triaxial nfw systems ( pearrubia et al .",
    "2009 ) . since simulated cold substructures always show a symmetric pattern with respect to the dwarf centre , which has not been observed so far in the case of umi s clump , pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that either a significant fraction of tidal debris remains undetected or that the origin of the clump is not related to the debris of a stellar cluster . in the particular case of umi s clump ,",
    "it is unclear if , starting with a typical globular cluster , this model can explain simultaneously its high surface brightness and its low internal velocity dispersion ( pearrubia et al .",
    "2009 ) . moreover , the position of the resulting stellar substructures in the simulations of pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) are localized at a projection distance from the galactic centre of @xmath209 times the apocentre of progenitor s orbit .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the orbit of the progenitor in umi is close to the plane of the sky , this constraint places the apocentre of the progenitor within two core radius , i.e.  @xmath210 pc , which might be insufficient to prevent orbital decay of the putative progenitor by dynamical friction .",
    "wilkinson et al .  ( 2004 ) suggested that the cold clump in umi is a projection of a cold extratidal population onto the face of the dsph . using numerical simulations ,",
    "read et al .",
    "( 2006 ) explored this scenario in the standard newtonian dark matter scenario and concluded that this hypothesis is falsified for two main reasons .",
    "first , there is always a source of hot tidal stars which mask any cold populations .",
    "secondly , the population of stars beyond the tidal radius always appears hot in projection because there are more stars on circular orbits than radial orbits at the tidal radius .",
    "since we can not see a reason to believe that these arguments can not be applied in mond , we conclude that if such cold clump is real , it could not have formed as a result of tidal effects .",
    "observations of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies strongly support a one - to - one relation between gravity at any radius and the enclosed baryonic mass . due to this empirical relation ,",
    "modified gravity theories like mond are able to account rather successfully for the amplitude and the shape of the rotation curves .",
    "there are some indirect phenomena that suggest that this empirical relation may break down at scales of dsph galaxies ( e.g. , gilmore et al .",
    "2007 , and references therein ) , challenging the interpretation of a modification of gravity as a substitute for dark matter .",
    "localized regions with enhanced stellar density and , where data permit , extremely cold kinematics have been detected in some dsph galaxies ( e.g. , olszewski & aaronson 1985 ; k03 ; coleman et al .",
    "2004 ; walker et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the framework of cdm ,",
    "k03 show that adopting a cored halo profile can preserve the umi s clump incorrupted for a hubble time .",
    "this cored halo can fit the observed stellar velocity dispersion and the persistence of the clump .",
    "however , although we are still unable to make robust predictions about how the dark matter distribution changes in the process of galaxy formation when the physics of baryons are included , the formation of a large core in a dark matter dominated galaxy , provides a hard challenge for @xmath3cdm .",
    "mashchenko et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that energy feedback in dwarf galaxies drives bulk gas motions and gravitational potential fluctuations large enough to turn the cusp into a flat core ( see also governato et al .",
    "they find that for a fornax sized galaxy , the dark matter core has an average density of @xmath211 pc@xmath212 at redshift @xmath213 , and the density decays a factor @xmath86 in @xmath214 pc .",
    "still , such a core would not be enough to avoid orbital spreading of the clump .    in the particular case of umi dsph galaxy , the density excess around the secondary peak can not be the remnant of a merger with umi of a smaller , gas - rich system because the stars have the same properties in terms of color and magnitude as the body of the umi population ( kleyna et al .",
    "one might wonder whether the density peak could instead be a projection effect and that what we are seeing is a cold , low - density tidal tail .",
    "numerical experiments by read et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that this scenario is very unlikely .",
    "another possibility is that the clump is a portion of the stationary debris of a disrupted globular cluster .",
    "this model is not implausible but can not be proven yet .",
    "a more drastic alternative scenario consists in interpreting the survival of substructures as an internal inconsistency of @xmath3cdm .",
    "we have explored if mond can explain the longevity of unbound clumps in dsph galaxies .",
    "following k03 , we have assumed that this overdensity structure is a disrupted stellar cluster and simulate its evolution in the gravitational potential derived in mond .",
    "whichever the form of the orbit , the clump is tidally disrupted within @xmath82 gyr , even if clump s self - gravity is included",
    ". one can decrease umi mass by adopting a smaller @xmath51 , slowing the process of orbital mixing because the crossing time for the clump becomes larger .",
    "however , even assuming a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath215 , the clump is disrupted in @xmath158 gyr .",
    "our conclusion that tidal forces should have disrupted the clump appears robust for the adopted value of the stellar mass - to - light ratio of umi .",
    "the external field acceleration felt by umi from the milky way depends on the galactocentric distance of umi , which is time dependent if the orbit of umi around the galactic halo is elongated .",
    "however , the temporal variation of the efe can hardly boost the longevity of the clump .    in the absence of any alternative model to explain the origin of the cold clump , we conclude that it is challenging for both @xmath3cdm and mond to explain the nature and dynamics of the clump in umi .",
    "another alternative of gravity suggested by moffat ( 2005 ) is the so - called modified gravity ( mog ) .",
    "it is a fully covariant theory which predicts a yukawa - like modification of newton s law . for a system with a baryonic mass of a few times @xmath216 like umi dsph galaxy ,",
    "mog predicts little or no observable deviation from newtonian gravity at galactic distances of @xmath217 pc ( e.g. , moffat & toth 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , explaining the internal dynamics of dsph galaxies is problematic without advocating dark matter , weakening the appeal of the mog model .",
    "other authors achieve to find modified theories of gravity which seem to reproduce the rotation curves of galaxies ( e.g. , capozziello et al .",

    "fellhauer & heggie ( 2005 ) studied the evolution of an idealized unbound system in a tidal field . in this appendix",
    ", we extend the theory to mond .",
    "the reader is referred to fellhauer & heggie ( 2005 ) for a discussion about the limitations of the theoretical model .",
    "we consider a small and unbound system on a circular orbit with radius @xmath218 in the axisymmetric potential of its host galaxy .",
    "therefore , the clump is embedded in the external field created by the galaxy @xmath219 .",
    "we use rotating , cluster - centred coordinates @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath108 . the @xmath220-axis points to the anticentre of the galaxy , and the @xmath221-axis points in the direction of orbital motion of the clump .",
    "the presence of the clump will change the gravitational potential by some increment @xmath222 , i.e.  @xmath223 .",
    "if @xmath222 can be treated as a perturbation , the gravitational field equation that governs the kinematics is @xmath224 ( milgrom 1986 ) . here",
    "@xmath225 is the density of the clump , @xmath226 and @xmath115 is the logarithmic derivative of @xmath227 ( in the unperturbed system ) .",
    "we adopt an equilibrium model in which stars are distributed uniformly within a triaxial ellipsoid and whose epicycles are centered at the centre of the ellipsoid .",
    "the equations of stellar motion in the epicyclic approximation ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1942 ) are given by @xmath228 @xmath229 @xmath230 where @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath108 are the deviations of the stellar orbit from the circular guiding centre . here",
    "@xmath231 is the vertical frequency , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 is the oort constant @xmath234    following fellhauer & heggie ( 2005 ) , it is possible to construct a distribution of epicyclic amplitudes so that the space density is uniform within a triaxial ellipsoid with semi - major axes @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is a free parameter that specifies the size of the clump , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 will be determined from the shape of closed epicycles .",
    "the field equation ( [ eq : milgrom86 ] ) for @xmath222 can be transformed into the standard poisson equation by making the substitution @xmath241 .",
    "the resultant equation can be written as @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "therefore , @xmath245 is the newtonian potential created by an ellipsoid of constant density @xmath246 , bounded by the surface @xmath247 , which is a prolate ellipsoid with eccentricity @xmath248 . taking advantage of the theory of homeoids , @xmath249 , where @xmath250 and @xmath251 are given in table 2 - 1 of binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , equations ( [ eq : epicyclic1])-([eq : epicyclic3 ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath252 and @xmath253 as @xmath254 @xmath255 @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the epicyclic frequency if the clump itself is neglected .",
    "as shown by fellhauer & heggie ( 2005 ) , the epicycle frequency and the vertical frequency are altered by the self - gravity of clump : @xmath258 and @xmath259 if we choose the lower sign for @xmath260 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : newkappa ] ) , there exist exponentially growing solutions ( i.e.  @xmath261 ) provided that @xmath262 in terms of density , one of the normal frequencies is imaginary when @xmath225 is smaller than a certain critical density @xmath263 , @xmath264 if this condition is fulfilled , the complete solution is a linear combination of oscillatory solutions with frequency @xmath265 ( those obtained by taking the upper sign for @xmath260 ) and exponentially growing solutions : @xmath266 @xmath267 @xmath268 where @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 and @xmath273 are free parameters , @xmath274 is the imaginary part of @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277    the equations for the epicyclic motions in the newtonian case are naturally recovered from the above equations just by taking @xmath278 and @xmath279 ( so that @xmath280 ) . due to the enhanced self - gravity of the clump by a factor of @xmath281 in mond , @xmath263 is smaller than in the equivalent newtonian galaxy , i.e.  the galaxy with additional dark matter that has the same @xmath282 . in the particular case",
    "that @xmath225 is much smaller than the critical density , we have : @xmath283 we see that the dissolution time for very small initial density is @xmath284 in the epicyclic approximation , which is valid for small clumps .",
    "since @xmath285 , the dissolution time is shorter in mond than in its equivalent newtonian galaxy . if the gravitational potential in which the clump is embedded is harmonic , we have @xmath286 and @xmath287 , then @xmath288 and @xmath289 , implying that the dissolution time is infinite",
