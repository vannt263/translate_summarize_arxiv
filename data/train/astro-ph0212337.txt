    "as described by the tpf science working group , the primary challenges of the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) are to `` _ _ detect radiation from earth - like planets in the habitable zones _ _ surrounding a statistically valid sample of @xmath0 150 solar type ( spectral types f , g , and k ) stars , to characterize the _",
    "orbital _ and _ physical _ properties of all detected planets to assess their habitability , and to characterize the _ atmospheres _ and search for potential",
    "_ biomarkers _ among the brightest candidates . ''",
    "the specified number of stars is a compromise between providing a high probability of success in finding habitable planets , setting a meaningful limit on the prevalence of planets in the event of a negative result , and the demands on the observing system .",
    "the average distance to the stars with terrestrial planets is perhaps the most critical parameter that sets the scale of tpf .",
    "the baseline tpf concept calls for operation toward stars as far away as @xmath015 pc , beyond which distance either the angular resolution or sensitivity become insufficient .",
    "if , however , earths were known to be ubiquitous , then one could concentrate on the closest stars ( ` < ` 5 pc ) using smaller telescopes and lower angular resolution .",
    "conversely , if earths were known to be rare , it would be necessary to use larger telescopes to look beyond 15 pc to find even a few examples . thus a major goal for a precursor",
    "tpf science program is to assess the fraction of stars with terrestrial planets in the habitable zones , denoted @xmath1 . a lesser but still valuable goal would be to assess the fraction of systems with giant planets located _ only _ beyond the habitable zone so that earths would have a chance to form and survive on stable orbits .    [ [ almost - everything - i - know - about - planets - i - learned - from - radial - velocities ] ] ( almost ) everything",
    "i know about planets i learned from radial velocities ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    as described at this conference , the radial velocity ( rv ) technique ( mayor and queloz 1995 ; marcy and butler 2000 ) has proven to be the most successful technique to date in finding planets and even planetary systems . with almost 50 planets now known",
    "( see the invaluable _ extrasolar planets encyclopaedia _ at _ http://www.obspm.fr/planets_ ; schneider 1996 ) , we have learned that approximately 5% of stars have gas giant planets located within a few au of their parent star and ranging in size from 0.17/_sin  i _",
    "m@xmath2 ( marcy & butler , this conference ; and udry , mayor & queloz 2000 ) to beyond the 13 m@xmath2 deuterium burning limit .",
    "as many have noted , these gas giants all exist at orbital radii well within water - ice condensation line thought to be the interior limit for the accretion of such planets .",
    "whether this discrepancy is due to dynamical effects or to an insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of planet formation is a matter of great debate .",
    "while only two planetary _ systems _ are known , ( @xmath3 and and hd83443 ) , marcy ( this conference ) claims that the residuals in the rv data for half of his sample exceed the experimental uncertainties and are highly suggestive of the presence of planets with periods longer than the present observational datasets . while multiple systems may eventually prove be common , as yet we know of no counterpart to our own `` grand design '' solar system with gas giants on circular orbits located beyond the water - ice condensation line and rocky planets nestled within the habitable zone .",
    "furthermore , the broad range of eccentricities and small orbital radii of the known giant planets may be inconsistent with the existence of habitable , terrestrial planets .",
    "some have argued that these unexpected results mean that solar systems like our own are rare .",
    "however , many would argue that we are simply reaping the fruits of using a technique ( radial velocity ) that is biased toward finding gas giant planets on short period orbits .",
    "what are the properties of the solar systems ( if any ) orbiting the 95% of solar type stars for which the rv technique has to date set only upper limits ? to make further progress we need rv data over longer periods to probe larger orbital distances , but we also need qualitatively new types of data .      a second technique that has recently borne fruit is the measurement of the transit of a planet in an edge - on orbit across the face of its parent star .",
    "the detection of the transits of hd 209458 ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ; henry et al .",
    "2000 ) is a spectacular demonstration of the power of this technique and a validation of the planetary interpretation of the rv data .",
    "in addition to giving the planet s true mass ( by determining the inclination angle ) , radius and density , spectroscopic observations might even reveal information the composition ( sasselov and seager 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the failure to find any transits toward to 3.4@xmath4 stars in the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( gilliland et al . 2000 ) is an indication that not all environments are hospitable to the formation or survival of planets .",
    "while jupiter - sized planets present a readily observable transit signal of 1.5% , earths produce a signal that is only @xmath5 in depth .",
    "however , if the @xmath6 accuracy of the recent hst observations of hd 209458 ( brown et al .",
    "2000 , this conference ) can be replicated or improved on in an imaging system , then the detection of earths around other stars is plausible .",
    "a wide area survey of @xmath7 stars is required because transits are rare due to the requirement for precise alignment  1 ( 10)% for planets at 1 ( 0.1 ) au  and infrequent due to orbital periods ranging from a few months up to once per year for a planet at 1 au .",
    "a number of groups are either already making such observations on the ground ( borucki et al .",
    "2000 ; howell et al .",
    "2000 ) or proposing them for space missions , including kepler in the us ( koch et al . 1998 ) and eddington / corot in europe ( leger _ et al_. 2000 ) .",
    "these projects would target solar type stars typically a few 100 to 1,000 pc away in fields of 10 - 100 sq .",
    "since these weak signals must be measured at least three times to identify and then confirm their presence , a mission dureation of at least 3 - 4 years is required to find planets in the habitable zone .",
    "searches for planets by gravitational microlensing take advantage of the fact that the presence of a second mass in a lens system produces multiple images of a background star .",
    "the lensing star produces a magnification of the background star s brightness that lasts a month or longer and which can be as great as a factor of 3 to 10 .",
    "the second mass , located within a few au of the central star , produces an additional magnification of a few percent up to a factor of two , lasting anywhere from a few days for a jupiter to a few hours for an earth ( peale 1997 ) .",
    "a number of groups have reported detections of binary stars and , with less certainty , of objects of jovian mass ( alcock et al .",
    "the frequency of these events is , unfortunately , quite low so that @xmath8 stars must be monitored continuously if the hours - long enhancements due to an earth are to be detected .",
    "advantages of the microlensing technique include the large photometric signal , the early identification of the lensing system which can then be constantly monitored , the well defined signature of a microlensing event , and the ability to find free floating planets .",
    "the disadvantages include the great distances to the lensing star and the background stars ( 4 and 8 kpc , respectively ) , and the fact that the derived mass of the planet depends on the poorly known stellar mass .",
    "further , most of the lensing stars will typically be m dwarfs or smaller and thus not direct solar analogs .",
    "proponents of both ground - based programs and space - based missions such as gest ( bennett et al .",
    "2000 ) have suggested that microlensing can reliably find tens of earths per year .",
    "the complementary technique to radial velocities for searching for planets around _",
    "nearby stars _ is astrometry .",
    "astrometry is relatively unaffected by the photospheric motions that limit the rv technique to detections of @xmath0 saturn - mass planets .",
    "furthermore , astrometric signals grow rather than shrink with increasing orbital distance , reversing the selection bias that affects rv measurements .",
    "the scale of the astrometric measurement challenge is set by two cases : the signal of a jupiter orbiting 5 au away from a g2v star 10 pc away is @xmath0500 @xmath9as while the astrometric signal of an earth orbiting 1 au away the same star is @xmath00.3 @xmath9as . detecting a planet of unknown period and amplitude",
    "requires a dataset extending at least as long as half the planet s orbital period . for reliable planet detection , the _ single measurement accuracy _ must be approximately half of the astrometric amplitude of the planetary signal ( brown et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "but these projects do not provide all the information we might require .",
    "projects that are not presently in the program that would be of considerable utility include the following : + @xmath10 a mission to determine @xmath1 from either transits or microlensing would set the distance scale for tpf and determine the required aperture size and angular resolution needed for a high probability of success in finding earths .",
    "while the corot mission is a good first step , a mission on the scale of eddington or kepler is required for robust statistics .",
    "an intensive ground - based microlensing campaign would a valuable near - term adjunct to this effort .",
    "@xmath10 a scaled down version of a nulling ir interferometer would detect and characterize giant planets around nearby stars , detect earths ( if any ) around the nearest stars , and demonstrate the technologies needed for more capable missions in the future .",
    "+ from the programmatic standpoint , the problem with these intermediate missions is that they will be expensive and are likely to delay the start of tpf , particularly if we have to wait for their results .",
    "the transit , microlensing , and coronagraphic missions have all been proposed for nasa s discovery program which has a @xmath0$300 m cost cap ; realistic missions might cost even more .",
    "a scaled down nulling ir interferometer could easily cost as much as sim .",
    "thus if we require these missions as precursors , we must accept delays in tpf and higher program costs .",
    "_ element 1 .",
    "initiate a mission to determine @xmath11 ( launch in 2006 ) . _",
    "if an adequate number of stars can be observed with the requisite precision in a discovery - class mission , then either a transit or a microlensing experiment would bolster our confidence in the goals of tpf and set the distance scale for planet searches .",
    "_ element 2 .",
    "initiate a tpf - lite mission ( launch in 2008 ) . _",
    "an ir nulling system could make spectroscopic studies of already known giant planets , survey for new giant planets on distant orbits , and even survey the nearest stars for earths .",
    "a visible light coronagraph like eclipse could target jupiters around nearby stars .",
    "_ element 3 .",
    "initiate nominal tpf in 2007 ( launch in 2012 ) . _",
    "the present nasa plan for tpf involves an ir nulling interferometer based on technology from the sim , ngst , and st-3 missions . with a suitable redirection of technology funds ,",
    "this plan would support a coronagraph alternative if the results of the ongoing studies are favorable .",
    "however , this schedule would not allow us to incorporate into the _ design _ of tpf the knowledge gleaned from a transit or microlensing experiment , or from the sim mission .",
    "the scale of tpf would have to be set by the compromise described above of wanting to observe @xmath0150 stars out to @xmath015 pc .",
    "tpf would however have a well characterized list of targets from radial velocity observations and astrometry using keck - i , vlt - i , and sim .",
    "_ element 4 .",
    "launch tpf based on knowledge of prevalence of earths ( launch after 2015 ) . _ if it is necessary to _ design _ tpf based on the known incidence of earths and the actual configuration of ( giant ) planets around nearby stars , then we must wait until data are obtained from the statistical experiments ( transits or microlensing ) and/or results from sim . under this scenario , tpf",
    "could not be launched before 2015 .",
    "achieving a high degree of certainty requires that we wait a very long time !",
    "the most aggressive approach , i.e. the present origins plan , would be to proceed at full speed with the nominal tpf ( element 3 ) . while one never has absolute certainty of what one will find in exploration ,",
    "_ a tpf capable of looking for earths around a few hundred stars out to 15 pc has a high probability of success except for the most pessimistic estimates of _",
    "@xmath12 a more deliberate approach would require an early measurement of @xmath11 ( element 1 ) , would fly a modest - scale precursor ( ir interferometer or coronagraph , element 2 ) , and would finish with a very capable spectroscopic mission in the middle of the next decade ( element 4 ) .",
    "the decision between the two approaches should be made on the basis of technological readiness .",
    "if the development of the necessary tpf technologies proceeds smoothly , then we should move as swiftly as budgets will allow to the nominal tpf . if not",
    ", then a more deliberate approach makes sense , allowing near - term discoveries and demonstrations of complex observing systems in space . over the next year",
    ", nasa must assess these options and in conjunction with esa and other international partners come up with a viable program that addresses the age - old questions that have motivated this most exciting conference ."
