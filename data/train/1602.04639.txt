    "recently the interest for the superfluid states of neutron stars ( ns ) has been reviving after the real time temperature measurements of casa remnant @xcite .",
    "theoretical models , devised to explain the cooling of such a system , demand for accurate predictions of the pairing gaps@xcite .",
    "in particular , the study was focussed on the @xmath0 proton - proton ( p - p ) and the @xmath1 neutron - neutron (",
    "n - n ) pairing in the ns core .",
    "the peculiar aspect of ns pairing is that the onset of superfluidity occurs at high nuclear density , where the @xmath2-stability condition imposes large isospin imbalance .",
    "the latter feature could in fact influence to a large extent the vertex corrections to be included in the gap equation . whereas it was definitely established that the self - energy corrections suppress the pairing magnitude@xcite , to what extent the core polarization affects the pairing interaction is not",
    "yet sufficiently clarified .",
    "this effect has been studied for several years ( an extensive bibliography is in ref.@xcite ) in the framework of the induced interaction theory ( iit)@xcite . more recently , ref.@xciteconsidered the two extreme situations of pure neutron matter(pnm ) and symmetric nuclear matter(snm ) .",
    "it was found that the core polarization , that in pnm quenches the n - n @xmath0 pairing gap , on the contrary enhances it in snm .",
    "the main conclusion was that in snm a large compensation occurs between self - energy and vertex corrections , at least in the @xmath0 n - n pairing .",
    "more recently polarization effects based on the rpa limit were included into the interaction to calculate the @xmath0 p - p pairing in @xmath2-stable nuclear matter@xcite and the @xmath1 n - n pairing in pure neutron matter@xcite .",
    "the present paper is intended to extend the study of ref.@xcite to asymmetric nuclear matter and to report new calculations of the particle - hole ( ph ) residual interaction and the polarization propagator , in the realistic context of @xmath2-stable nuclear matter suitable for application to the ns pairing .",
    "the main scope is to investigate the interplay between density fluctuations and spin density fluctuations in singlet and triplet spin states within the particle - particle ( pp ) coupling , and in particular the crossover from attractive to repulsive interaction due to the core polarization , when moving from snm to pnm .",
    "the baryon density threshold @xmath3 , at which such a mechanism disappears , is also determined .",
    "these pieces of information are essential to study the various ns superfluid states .",
    "the induced interaction theory for symmetric nuclear matter is reviewed in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite and references therein quoted ) .",
    "its extension to asymmetric nuclear matter is straightforward . in this case",
    "the ph irreducible interaction @xmath4 is still rotationally invariant in spin space , s being the total spin in ph coupling , but it is not in isospin space , i.e. @xmath5 . in the iit framework @xmath4",
    "is determined by the equation diagrammatically depicted     itself , and q is the momentum transfer.,width=453 ]    in fig.1 : the driving term ( first term on the r.h.s . of fig.1 ) is assumed to be approximated by g - matrix ; the inducedterm ( second term on the r.h.s . ) describes the interaction mediated by the medium excitations via the dressed polarization propagator ( bubble in fig.1 ) .",
    "the vertex insertions represent the full ph irreducible interaction itself .",
    "the analytic expression of @xmath4 is given by the 2@xmath62 matrix equation in isospin space    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the energy - momentum transfer and @xmath9 denotes the induced interaction .",
    "this equation is solved in the landau limit @xcite .",
    "the polarization propagator @xmath10 is calculated as bubble series but , at variance with rpa , the vertex insertions between bubbles are expressed in terms of whole ph interaction @xmath11@xcite . in that limit",
    "this series can be summed up , resulting into a simple algebraic formula for the diagonal matrix elements @xmath12 and for the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the free polarization propagator@xcite corrected by the mean - field effects ( in the last line the q dependence is understood ) .",
    "its explicit form is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lindhard function@xcite . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are level density and quasi - particle strength at the fermi surface , respectively , calculated within the extended brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approximation ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that the bubble expansion is expected to be rapidly convergent at high density because @xmath20 .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs.(1)-(3 ) have been solved by means of the so called lns potential , that is a skyrme parametrization of the energy density functional calculated in the bhf approximation@xcite .",
    "the difference from the pure skyrme force is that the lns parameters are derived from @xmath21 calculations rather than by fitting the empirical nuclear data .",
    "the lns interaction enables a strong simplification of the formalism @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the ph induced interaction in nuclear matter @xmath24 was performed in a wide density range at @xmath25 , and extended to non vanishing values of momentum transfer , as requested by the calculation of physical observables . in the landau limit the q - range is restricted to @xmath26 , being @xmath27 the fermi momentum corresponding to the density @xmath28 . in the present paper only @xmath22 and @xmath29 will be discussed , @xmath30 being the fermi momentum corresponding to the total density , .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 , for the two values of the total spin @xmath31 in ph coupling and the two limiting values of momentum transfer range , @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "three values of the symmetry parameter @xmath32 have been chosen , including for comparison the symmetric case . at @xmath33",
    "the curves corresponding to n - n and p - p matrix elements overlap , whereas at @xmath34 they split into two different components for the isospin symmetry breaking in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the general trend is that @xmath35 is much larger at low density , as expected from the long - range character of the induced interaction .",
    "in addition , the isospin splitting @xmath36 is increasing with @xmath2 , whereas @xmath37 is almost insensitive . in r.h.s .",
    "2 the dependence on the momentum transfer is depicted . in our approximation",
    "only the kinematic dependence of the free polarization propagator is considered , that is monotonically decreasing with @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath9 takes the smallest values at the upper limit @xmath23 of the momentum transfer range .    in symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath33 , the effective interaction can be expressed in terms of the landau - migdal ( lm ) parameters @xcite . on microscopic basis",
    "the induced interaction @xmath39 is the correction to the mean field prediction : the s=0 curves correct the lm parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the s=1 curves correct the lm parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that , in the induced interaction theory , the low - density instability region of the equation of state , corresponding to negative compression modulus , disappears at any @xmath2 , as it can be easily checked in the calculation of the lm parameters .",
    "this is an old standing result at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the nuclear induced interaction has also been calculated in the spin states of neutron - rich matter @xmath44 in pp coupling , for the sake of application to the ns pairing .",
    "the n - n and p - p matrix elements in the spin singlet state are given by @xmath45\\,\\,,\\ ] ] and in the spin - triplet pp state @xmath46\\,\\,.\\ ] ] moving from snm to pnm the spin singlet interaction is mainly driven by the interplay between density fluctuations ( @xmath47 ) and spin density fluctuations ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the multiplicity of the latter is expected to play the major role considering that the two contributions are of the same order of magnitude@xcite .",
    "the spin triplet interaction is only driven by the interplay between neutron and proton core polarizations .",
    "the results for the spin singlet state are displayed in fig .",
    "3 as a function of the symmetry parameter for different densities of neutron - rich matter .",
    "we notice that the n - n effective interaction is attractive on the side of symmetric nuclear matter , ( @xmath33 ) , indicating the dominance of spin - density excitations over the density excitations , whereas it is the other way around on the side of almost pure neutron matter ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "interesting is the value of the symmetry parameter @xmath50 , where the two effects balance each other , marking the crossover from attractive to repulsive interaction . for asymmetries close to @xmath50 the effective interaction is vanishing small , and , at variance with the symmetric nuclear matter , no compensation is allowed between self - energy and vertex corrections @xcite .",
    "the value of the crossover asymmetry @xmath50 is depending on density .",
    "there is density threshold @xmath3 : for @xmath51 the induced interaction is repulsive at any asymmetry . in the present estimate for @xmath3",
    "is about 0.09 @xmath52 . in the case of the p - p effective interaction",
    "the situation is quite different , because in this case the neutron core polarization is attractive and the proton core polarization is repulsive .",
    "therefore , increasing asymmetry , the former becomes more and more dominant , resulting into an increasingly attractive strength of the induced interaction . in the p - p case",
    "the critical density @xmath3 is the lower limit for the existence of the isospin crossover .",
    "the results at @xmath29 are depicted in r.h.s . of fig .",
    "3 . from the kinematic behavior of the free propagator it turns out that , increasing the momentum transfer , the crossover is pushed to lower values of both asymmetry and density in the n - n case but rapidly disappears in the case of protons .",
    "the p - p effective interaction in spin singlet state was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for nuclear matter in @xmath2-stable regime . at @xmath53=0.2 @xmath52",
    "it was found a value of -14.2 mev @xmath54 to be compared with the value -1.2 mev @xmath54 from the present study .",
    "the deviation by one order of magnitude should not be considered too large , taking into account the different approximations adopted in the two approaches , in particular , the missing three - body force in the ref .",
    "@xcite calculation .",
    "the results for the triplet case are depicted in fig .",
    "4 . in such a case there",
    "no interplay between density and spin density fluctuations so that no any crossover is possible .",
    "the isospin dependence is easily understood by the competition between neutron and proton polarization : moving from snm to pnm the n - n @xmath55 monotonically decreasing and p - p @xmath56 is monotonically increasing .",
    "the main feature is that the induced interaction is always repulsive , the repulsion being attenuated by finite momentum transfer , as shown in fig .",
    "4 ( left ) . this property may eventually explain why in finite nuclei it is found that strength of t=0 pairing is never stronger than t=1 strength in spite of the fact that the bare t=0 force yields a much stronger gap than the s=0 one .      in conclusion , from the calculations of the induced interaction one should expect the core polarization to have a deep influence on the pairing interaction in @xmath2-stable nuclear matter and , in particular , on the three superfluid states supposed to exist in ns .",
    "in the case of the low - density n - n @xmath0 pairing , located in the ns crust , the induced interaction turns out to be repulsive , as shown in the fig . 3 for spin singlet states , because the crust is a very neutron - rich state .",
    "therefore , the gap is expected to be reduced not only by the self - energy corrections , but also by the induced interaction .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the high density @xmath1 n - n pairing , located in the ns inner core , the strong core polarization , that is always repulsive in spin triplet states , should suppress completely the high density",
    "n - n pairing , at variance with ref . @xcite . on the contrary , in the case of @xmath0 p - p pairing , where low - density proton fraction is embedded into high - density neutron matter",
    ", the neutron core induces a strong attractive enhancement on the p - p cooper pairs so to compete with the self - energy suppression .",
    "therefore , after the introduction in the gap equation of the self - energy corrections of @xmath2-stable nuclear matter @xcite , the inclusion of the induced interaction on the same footing should rise the theoretical study of ns superfluidity to a quite satisfactory stage .",
    "such calculations are in progress .",
