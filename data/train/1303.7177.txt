    "the function @xmath81 ( as the integral from @xmath52 to @xmath82 suggests ) is the profit for playing a dynamic ( i.e. high - frequency ) market - making strategy .",
    "since @xmath84 , the addition of the market - making mechanism @xmath81 to the strategy @xmath23 is more profitable than the buy - and - hold strategy @xmath80 alone . in consequence",
    ", it makes sense to play market - maker dynamically instead of simply apply a buy - and - hold strategy .",
    "since in principe @xmath82 can be very big , in order to compare strategies we have to compute the value function per time unit , i.e. @xmath85 . using the integral version of the mean - value theorem",

    "this seems counter - intuitive because , the market - making being lightning fast , it should not be influenced by the long - range behaviour of the mid - price .",
    "however , the inventory turnover is slower because it takes several trades to build up and come back to zero , and that is where the directional bet @xmath97 enters into the game .",
    "another feature is * the effect of a non - constant decay rate @xmath13*. notice that the optimal spread @xmath64 is decreasing in @xmath98 and the value function @xmath23 is decreasing in @xmath13 . if the intensity of order arrival increases , which can be interpreted as either less market orders or a more populated limit order book ( lob ) , then the market - maker has to reduce her spread to keep her order flow constant . but this makes her pnl smaller because she is selling liquidity cheaper .",
    "* the effect of the market spread @xmath99 * is very interesting . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath100 does not appear at all in the optimal controls , which means that the market - making strategy is independent of @xmath100 .",
    "on the other hand , the value function @xmath23 is decreasing in @xmath99 .",
    "in consequence , the pnl of the strategy decreases as the spread increases .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the hypothesis that the intensity of the arrival of market orders depends on the distance to the other side of the book , not on the distance to the mid - price .",
    "indeed , the bigger the spread , the less market flow captured by the market - maker , even if her position relative to the mid - price does not change .",
    "we have put the intensity @xmath101 into the expectation operator .",
    "this is because our formulation allows a * stochastic intensity @xmath20*. in fact , our formulation allows as well * asymmetric intensities @xmath102 and decays @xmath103 * ; the only difference is that the symmetry via @xmath104 is lost and we would have 2 different , complicated exponentials instead .",
    "we will penalise the inventory in two ways :    1 .   a penalty @xmath105 at expiry , depending on the spread .",
    "this models the fact that the market - maker will have to clear her inventory at the market , and as such she will pay the spread for each share : @xmath106 for example , if @xmath107 we recover the stoll model for a quadratic penalty on the inventory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   an integral penalty @xmath108 of the ( squared ) inventory during the remaining of the trading session , weighted by the volatility @xmath5 of the mid - price @xmath3 .",
    "this is a sort of tracking error with respect to a flat - inventory position , and is a very standard choice ( see e.g. guilbaud - pham @xcite and cartea - jaimungal @xcite ) : @xmath109    in this section , we will consider the following value function : @xmath110\\,,\\quad \\pi : = \\pi_1 + \\pi_2\\,.\\ ] ] notice that if @xmath111 we recover the previous linear case . concerning the parameters , the important one is @xmath112 since it gives the penalty as a perturbation of the value function we already computed .",

    "if @xmath162 is negative enough to have @xmath173 then the market - maker could even accept to buy and sell at the same price , earning no profit in the operation except for the rebate .",
    "this strategy is called _ scalping _ or _ rebate arbitrage _ , and has been commented by several practitioners ( see e.g. bodek and shaw @xcite ) .    from the previous observations , it follows that the fee structure in high - frequency trading is crucial for the liquidity offer ( measured as both the size of the spread and the available volume in the lob ) and the profitability of high - frequency market - making strategies .",
    "moreover , trading venues with a rebate mechanism have smaller spreads , are more profitable for market - makers and lure non - market - making arbitrage strategies . these findings , although they are based on our model and its hypotheses , are consistent with several other theoretical and empirical studies on high - frequency trading .",
    "for example , colliard and hoffmann @xcite found that the french financial transaction tax ( ftt ) imposed on august 2012 has reduced the number of aggressive limit orders , i.e. those that reduce the spread .",
    "the ftt also reduced the depth of the market , i.e. the sum of available volume at best bid and best ask , as well as the trading volume .",
    "finally , the market spread and the volatility were unaffected . comparing our results with those of colliard and hoffman , one could argue that the loss of volume at the best quotes and inside the market spread was due to traders increasing their spreads as a response to an increase of @xmath162 .",
    "that said , it is worth to mention that ftt did not apply to market - makers who are members of the exchanges .",
    "in consequence , these fee - exempted market - makers continued offering liquidity at the best quotes , which explains why the market spread did not change with the ftt implementation .",
