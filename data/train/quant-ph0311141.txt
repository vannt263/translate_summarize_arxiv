    "quantum teleportation , originally proposed by bennett et al , is one of the most striking progress of quantum information theory [ 1 ] .",
    "it allows the transmission of an unknown qubit state from a sender `` alice '' to a spatially distant receiver `` bob '' via a quantum channel with the aid of some classical communication",
    ". it will be useful in quantum computers [ 2 , 3 ] .",
    "it can be used to transmit information reliably in noisy situations where a message would otherwise be degraded , and to transfer information from fleeting or hard - to - control carriers to particles more suitably for permanent storage .",
    "moreover , it has application in quantum cryptography and quantum dense coding [ 4 - 8 ] .    at present",
    ", teleportation has been generalized to many cases [ 9 - 15 ] and demonstrated with the polarization photon [ 16 ] and a single coherent mode of field [ 17 ] in the experiments [ 18 , 19 ] . due to the influence of environment ,",
    "the quantum channel composed of a pure entangled state is always taken to be nonmaximal .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to study the teleportatoin of an unknown quantum state using a partly entangled state as the quantum channel .",
    "shi et al and lu et al proposed a protocol for probabilistic teleportation of two - particle entangled state via a three - particle nonmaximally entangled state [ 12 , 14 ] .",
    "however , the form of two - particle entangled state is not a general form of two - particle state . in order to conquer this limitation , yan et al",
    "have generalized shi s method to the two - particle state of general form by using partly entangled four - particle pure state as the quantum channel [ 15 ] . in this scheme",
    ", an unknown two - particle state of general form , whether entangled or not , can be transmitted from a sender to a receiver through a partly entangled four - particle pure state with certain probability .",
    "unfortunately in their protocol sixteen unitary transformations must be implemented . obviously , it is not favorable to the experimental realization of teleportation .",
    "recently , barenco et al showed that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits can be decomposed into the combinations of a set of one - bit quantum gates and two - bit controlled - not ( cnot ) gates [ 20 ] .",
    "in terms of only single - qubit gates , two - qubit cnot gates , von neumann measurement and classically controlled operations , liu et al presented quantum logic networks for probabilistic teleportation of a single qubit and a two - particle entangled state , using a partially entangled pair and a three - particle nonmaximally entangled state , respectively [ 21 ] .",
    "clearly the quantum logic networks for probabilistic teleportation will be important in realizing the teleportation scheme in the experiment .",
    "gao et al simplified the scheme of ref.[15 ] first , then give a quantum logic network for probabilistic teleportation of two - particle state of general form [ 22 ] .",
    "since there are a great quantity of many particle quantum system in the real world , for example , the quantum computer is one , so it is important to study the teleportation of many particle state and deal with teleportation problem in a comprehensive way . in this paper",
    "we discuss probabilistic teleportation of many particle state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by introducing some notations and symbols in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we develop an overall framework for probabilistically teleporting an n - particle state of general form via a 2n - particle nonmaximally entangled channel in a comprehensive way . the essential idea behind this framework",
    "may be simplified in section 4 by considering the special cases when n=2 , 3 , 4 .",
    "first , by means of the primitive operations consisting of single - qubit gates , two - qubit cnot gates , von neumann measurement and classically controlled operations , we present an even simpler and more efficient quantum logic network than that of ref.[22 ] for probabilistically teleporting an unknown two - particle state of general form .",
    "second , the quantum networks for probabilistic teleportation of a three - particle state and a four - particle state of general form are also exhibited .",
    "some notations and symbols used throughout the paper are displayed here .",
    "@xmath0 for any unitary operator @xmath1 and @xmath2 , define the ( @xmath3 + 1)-bit ( @xmath4-dimensional ) controlled operation @xmath5 as @xmath6 for all @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 in the exponent of @xmath9 means the product of the bits @xmath10 .",
    "that is , the operator @xmath9 is applied to the last qubit if the first @xmath3 qubits are all equal to one , and otherwise , nothing is done .",
    "note that @xmath11 is equated with @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath12 matrix corresponding to @xmath13 is @xmath14 ( where the basis states are lexicographically ordered , i.e. , @xmath15 ) . @xmath5",
    "maps @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 denotes the and of the boolean variables @xmath19 ) ; that is , if the first @xmath3 qubits are all set to @xmath20 then the last qubit is flipped , otherwise the last qubit is left alone .",
    "in this section , we propose the scheme for probabilistic teleportation of an @xmath3-particle state of general form .",
    "suppose that alice is to deliver an unknown normalized @xmath3-particle state of general form @xmath21 to a remote receiver bob via a normalized quantum channel of a nonmaximally entangled state of @xmath22 particles @xmath23 here @xmath24 s are arbitrary complex numbers satisfying @xmath25 , the notion @xmath26 means the set of strings of length @xmath3 with each letter being either zero or one , and @xmath27 is the smallest of real numbers @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the combined state @xmath32 is the state of the total system .",
    "we use the usual convention that the first @xmath22 particles 1 , 2 , @xmath30 , @xmath22 ( on the left ) belong to alice , the other @xmath3 particles @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 belong to bob .",
    "the sender alice and the receiver bob together generated and shared the nonmaximally entangled state of eq.(5 ) , that is , alice s last @xmath3 qubits and bob s qubits start out in a state of the form eq.(5 ) .",
    "alice sends her qubits 1 and @xmath36 , 2 and @xmath37 , @xmath30 , @xmath3 and @xmath22 through a cnot gate respectively , and subsequently sends each of her first @xmath3 qubits through a hadamard gate .",
    "then she measures the @xmath22 qubits on her possession and transmits this information to bob over a classical communication channel .",
    "the post - measurement state of bob s qubits will end up in @xmath38 possible unnormalized states @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , one of which is @xmath41 .",
    "depending on alice s classical message , bob knows exactly in which one of the @xmath38 states his qubits is . in order to achieve teleportation , bob needs to recover the original state @xmath42 at his side from the unnormalized states of his n particles .",
    "he introduces an auxiliary particle @xmath43 with the initial state @xmath44 and performs a collective unitary transformation @xmath45 on the state of particles @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 and @xmath43 , where @xmath46 if the measurement outcome on the auxiliary particle made by bob is @xmath47 , the teleportation fails .",
    "while the measurement result is @xmath44 , the state of bob s particles @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath30 , @xmath35 is in one of @xmath38 states @xmath48 not containing @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , and bob can fix up his state , recovering @xmath51 , by the appropriate quantum gates .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath52 may be written as@xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the parallel action of @xmath56 unity operators and @xmath57 not gates , respectively . for saving space",
    ", we do not give an implementation of @xmath52 in terms of one and two qubit operations and also do not depict out the quantum circuit illustrating the teleportation procedure of the @xmath3-particle state of general form via a shared @xmath22-particle nonmaximally entanglement .",
    "but in what follows we give the special cases when n=2 , 3 , 4 .",
    "in this section we construct the quantum logic circuit implementing the probabilistic teleportation process of a two - particle , three - particle and four - particle state of general form .",
    "that will make the scheme of probabilistic teleportation more concrete .    in ref.[22",
    "] we discussed the case n=2 . here",
    "we take @xmath58 which can also realize the teleportation with the same probability of success as in ref.[22 ] .",
    "@xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath60 the gate array of @xmath59 is depicted in fig.1 . by the technique for simulating @xmath61 gates given by barenco et al and the eq.(9 )",
    "we derive @xmath62 which is the decomposition constructed out of only two - qubit cnot gate @xmath63 along with a set of one - qubit operations ( of the form @xmath11 ) . here",
    "we assume @xmath64 , then @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 . in eq.(10 )",
    "@xmath69 are the two - qubit cnot gates @xmath63 of control qubit @xmath70 and target qubit @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 means the unity operation on particle 6 .    in this way , only a collective unitary operation @xmath59",
    "is required to achieve the probabilistic teleportation of an unknown general two - particle quantum state @xmath74 , which , with regard to quantum gate array , is simpler and more efficient than the scheme in ref.[22 ] and even greater simplification than the scheme in ref.[15 ] where sixteen different collective unitary operations are needed for the same task .",
    "if the measurement outcome made by bob on the auxiliary qubit @xmath43 is @xmath47 , the teleportation fails .",
    "however , if the measurement result is @xmath44 , the state of bob s three particles 7 , 8 and 9 is one of sixty - four states @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath30 , @xmath80 .",
    "there are no @xmath81 in the coefficients of these states , for instance , one of these sixty - four states is @xmath82 the teleportation can be successfully achieved with the classical information from alice and corresponding unitary operations ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) which are easily designed on the particles 7 , 8 and 9 . for example",
    "bob can fix up @xmath87 into the initial state of particles 1 , 2 and 3 by applying first a @xmath84 and then a @xmath86 gate on the particle 7 .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath88 can be written @xmath89 with the help of the work done by barenco et al [ 20 ] , it is not difficult for us to give the decomposition of @xmath88 using basic operations ( @xmath11 and @xmath63 ) . for saving space , we will not exhibit it here .",
    "the sequence of the gate @xmath88 is illustrated in fig.2 .      here",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath30 , @xmath93 are single - qubit rotation transformations .",
    "we can carefully choose @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath30 , @xmath93 to make the quantum state of the particles 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 to be the quantum channel @xmath94 by the first dash line . if the measurement result on the auxiliary qubit at the output state is @xmath44 , the teleportation is successful with the final state of the particle 7 , 8 and 9 being reconstructed as the initial state to be teleported .",
    "note that a controlled unitary operation acting on any number of qubits followed by the measurement of the control qubit can be replaced by the measurement of the control qubit preceding the controlled operation [ 21 ] .",
    "therefore , fig.3 can be re - expressed as fig.4 .    in fig.4 , the controlled operation can be realized locally by bob depending on the results of the six measurements performed by alice on her own qubits . if and only if the outcome of alice s measurement is 1 , bob can execute the controlled - not @xmath95 or controlled-@xmath96 .",
    "if the measurement result of the auxiliary particle is @xmath47 , the teleportation fails .",
    "if the result is @xmath44 , the final state of particles 7 , 8 and 9 at bob s side will be collapsed into @xmath97 , which is the desired state . that is to say , if the measurement outcome on the state of the auxiliary qubit is @xmath44 , perfect teleportation is accomplished .    for the case n=4",
    ", the unitary operator @xmath98 fig.5 gives an implementation of @xmath99 . with the result provided by barenco",
    "et al regarding how to simulate a general controlled operation @xmath100 from only single - qubit gates @xmath11 and two - qubit cnot gates @xmath63 , @xmath99 can be built from just this gate set . for saving space ,",
    "we will not exhibit it here .      here",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath30 , @xmath102 are single - qubit rotation transformations .",
    "we can properly choose @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath30 , @xmath102 to make the quantum state of the particles 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 to be the quantum channel @xmath103 by the first dash line . if the measurement result on the auxiliary qubit at the output state is @xmath44 , the teleportation is successful with the final state of the particle 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 being reconstructed as the initial state to be teleported .",
    "in fig.7 if the measurement result of the auxiliary particle is @xmath47 , the teleportation fails .",
    "if the result is @xmath44 , the final state of particles 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 at bob s side will be collapsed into @xmath104 , which is the desired state . that is to say , if the measurement outcome on the state of the auxiliary qubit is @xmath44 , perfect teleportation is accomplished .    in summary , a protocol of probabilistic teleporting an unknown general @xmath3-particle state by a shared @xmath22-particle nomaximally entangled state",
    "is presented . as special cases ,",
    "the quantum circuits for probabilistic teleporting a three - particle state and a four - particle state of general form via a six - particle and an eight - particle nonmaximally entangled state are constructed respectively . by means of an auxiliary qubit and a unitary operation ,",
    "a simpler scheme than that in ref.[15 ] and a more efficient quantum circuit than that in ref.[22 ] for probabilistic teleportation of a two - particle state of general form through a shared four - particle nonmaximally entangled state were exhibited .",
    "it deserves to be mentioned that as long as the sender and all the receivers initially share the form of the entanglement , as specified in our paper , an unknown @xmath3-particle general state can be probabilistically teleported to many spatially receivers .",
