    "what is the minimum size of an object in which every object of size @xmath1 embeds ? issued from the category theory , questions of this kind appeared in graph theory .",

    "recently , z. fredi and p. komjth @xcite studied a connected question .",
    "we use here the following definition  : given a sub - class @xmath7 of graphs ( trees , planar graphs , etc . ) , a graph @xmath8 is @xmath1-_universal _ for @xmath7 if for every graph @xmath9 of size @xmath1 in @xmath10 is a minor of @xmath11 i.e. it can be obtained from @xmath12 by successive contractions or deletions of edges .",
    "inspired by the robertson and seymour work @xcite on graph minors , p. duchet asked whether a polynomial bound in @xmath1 could be found for the size of a @xmath1-universal tree for the class of trees .",
    "we give here a positive sub - quadratic answer .    from an applied point of view , such an object would possibly allows us to define a tree from the representation of its contraction .",
    "the main results of this paper are the following theorems which give bounds for the minimum size of a @xmath1-universal tree for the class of trees  :    [ th1 ] a @xmath1-universal tree for the class of trees has at least @xmath13 edges where @xmath14 is the euler s constant .",
    "[ th2 ] there exists a @xmath1-universal tree @xmath0 for the class of trees with less than @xmath5 edges for a fixed constant @xmath15    our proof follows a recursive construction where large trees are obtained by some amalgamation process involving simpler trees . with this method",
    ", the constant @xmath16 could be reduced to 1.88 ... but it seems difficult to improve this value .",
    "we conclude the paper with related open questions .",
    "our graphs are undirected and simple ( with neither loops nor multiple edges ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 a graph ( its vertex set is @xmath18 and its edge set is @xmath19 ( a subset of the family of all the @xmath18-subsets of cardinality 2 ) ) . referring to c. thomassen @xcite , we recall some basic definitions that are useful for our purpose :    we denote by @xmath20 the path of size @xmath21    if @xmath22 is a vertex then @xmath23 the _ degree _ of @xmath24 is the number of edges incident to @xmath25    let @xmath26 be an edge of @xmath19 , the graph denoted by @xmath27 is the graph on the vertex set of @xmath9 , whose edge set is the edge set of @xmath9 without @xmath26 .",
    "we call classically this operation _ deletion_.    let @xmath28 be an edge of @xmath17 , we name _ contraction of _ @xmath9 _ along _ @xmath29 the graph denoted by @xmath30 , with @xmath31 where @xmath16 is a new vertex and @xmath32 the edge set which contains all the edges of the sub - graph @xmath33 on @xmath34 and all the edges of the form @xmath35 for @xmath36 or @xmath37 belonging to @xmath38 .",
    "we say that @xmath39 is a _",
    "minor _ of @xmath9 if and only if we can obtain it from @xmath9 by successively deleting and  /or contracting edges , in an other way , we can define the set @xmath40 of minors of @xmath9 by the recursive formula  :    @xmath41    the notion of minor induces a partial order on graphs .",
    "we write @xmath42 to mean `` @xmath43 is a minor of @xmath44 '' .    for technical reasons ,",
    "we prefer to use the size of a tree ( edge number ) rather than its order ( vertex number ) .",
    "finally , let us recall that , a graph @xmath8 is @xmath1-_universal _ _ for a sub - class _ @xmath7 of graphs if for every element @xmath9 of @xmath7 with @xmath1 edges@xmath45 is a minor of @xmath8 .",
    "in this section , we prove that a @xmath1-universal tree @xmath0 for the trees has asymptotically at least @xmath46 edges .",
    "we use the fact that @xmath0 has to contain all spiders of size @xmath1 as minors .",
    "a _ spider _",
    "@xmath47 _ on a vertex _",
    "@xmath48 is a tree such that @xmath49 .",
    "we denote the spider constituted by paths of lengths @xmath50 by @xmath51 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    fig.1 .",

    "a @xmath1-universal tree @xmath0 for the class of trees has to contain as minors all spiders of size @xmath1 .",
    "so , for all @xmath70 it contains as minors the spiders @xmath71 where we have @xmath72 times the letter @xmath70 . by the lemma [ lm1 ] , for all @xmath73 , @xmath74 and if @xmath1 is odd , @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the terminal edges of the @xmath76 constitute a partition of @xmath0 . by the lemma [ lm2 ] , this involves that @xmath0 has at least @xmath77 edges if @xmath1 is even and @xmath78 edges if @xmath1 is odd .",
    "an easy calculation proves that these values are always equal to @xmath79 .",
    "( of the theorem [ th1 ] ) it follows from the usual estimate @xmath80 and the inequality @xmath81 .",
    "what the above proof shows , in fact , is the following :    a minimum @xmath1-universal spider for the class of spiders has @xmath82 edges .",
    "the spider @xmath83 is clearly a @xmath1-universal spider of size @xmath82 for the class of spiders , and by theorem [ th3 ] it is a minimum value .",
    "in the sequel , we deal with _ rooted graph _ ,",
    "i.e. graph @xmath9 where we can distinguish a special vertex denoted by @xmath84 , called the _ root_. conventionally ,",
    "any contracted graph @xmath85 of same rooted graph @xmath9 will be rooted at the unique vertex which is the image of the root under the contraction mapping , we say in this case that the rooted graph @xmath85 is a _ rooted contraction _ of @xmath9 .",
    "note that , the contraction operator suffices to obtain all minor trees of a tree .",
    "so , we can now define the following new notion for sub - classes of rooted trees  : a rooted tree @xmath0 is _",
    "strongly @xmath1-universal for a sub - classes _ @xmath7 _ of rooted trees _ if for every rooted tree @xmath2 _ in _ @xmath7 of size @xmath86 is a rooted contraction of @xmath0 .",
    "the concept of root is introduced to avoid problems with graph isomorphisms that , otherwise would greatly impede our inductive proof .    for every edge @xmath26 of a tree @xmath2",

    "fig.2 . a main stem in bold    the following lemma suggests the procedure which will be used to find a sub - quadratic upper bound for universal trees .",
    "roughly speaking , it endows every tree with some recursive structure constructed with the help of main stems .",

    "a tree may possess in general several main stems .",
    "let us notice also that a main stem is not necessarily one of the longest paths which contain the root .",
