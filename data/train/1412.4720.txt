    "our objective is , for @xmath11 , to determine the particle flux , @xmath12 , from a steady source onto the boundary @xmath13 in the case where particles are absorbed on contact with the boundary at @xmath14 .",
    "dealing with an absorbing boundary is difficult when there is both advection and diffusion because there is no simple local boundary condition which @xmath3 must satisfy .",
    "for this reason we also consider a reference problem where the boundary is completely permeable and has no effect on particles , the flux in this case is denoted by @xmath15 .    the primary motivation for analysing this problem arose from studies of the structure of fractal measures generated by random dynamical systems which can serve as models for particles in turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "a fractal measure can be characterised by the statistics of constellations of nearby points sampling the measure .",
    "the simplest case is where a constellation consisting of just two points is characterised by the distance @xmath16 between two trajectories . defining @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a correlation length of the flow ,",
    "it is found that @xmath19 obeys an advection - diffusion equation when @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "the exponent of this power - law determines the correlation dimension of the fractal @xcite .",

    "the shape of a triangle may be characterised by the parameter @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is its area and @xmath26 its radius of gyration . for a fractal measure generated by a random flow we showed that the variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 evolve according to an advection - diffusion process in the region @xmath22 and @xmath29 , with an absorbing boundary on the line @xmath13 , and we are led to consider the problem illustrated in figure [ fig : 1 ] .",

    "we consider the effect of an absorbing boundary in section [ sec : 3 ] , showing how an implicit expression for the flux can be written in terms of a source of antiparticles which are created on the boundary .",
    "the one - dimensional case is solved explicitly , and we show that the method is in accord with results from the theory of first - passage time processes , discussed in @xcite . in section [ sec : 4 ] the results from sections [ sec : 2 ] and [ sec : 3 ] are combined to obtain the flux , in two dimensions , from a steady source at @xmath45 onto an absorbing boundary along the @xmath30 axis . a surprising cancellation ensures that the exponent @xmath46 is the same as that for the completely permeable boundary treated in section [ sec : 2 ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : 5 ] with some numerical illustrations of the quality of the approximations and some comments on the structure of our asymptotic results .",
    "in this section we consider the problem of calculating the steady state particle density and the corresponding flux arising from a steady point source .",
    "we then apply the results in two dimensions to calculate the density and flux along a line , the @xmath30 axis .",
    "the line has no effect on the particles : it is a completely permeable or transparent boundary and the particles may cross it multiple times and at different locations .      in @xmath2 dimensions the free space propagator or green s function for ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) ( that is , the probability density for a particle released at @xmath1 at time zero to reach @xmath4 at time @xmath5 ) is @xmath47 }                        { \\sqrt { { \\rm det}({\\bf d } ) \\left ( 4\\pi t\\right ) ^{d } } }   \\right ] \\theta\\left(t\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the heaviside step function , @xmath35 is the displacement vector @xmath49 and @xmath50 the particle density at point @xmath51 at time @xmath5 is therefore @xmath52 the flux vector @xmath53 is @xmath54 where the gradient is with respect to @xmath4 . now consider the steady - state density @xmath55 and flux @xmath56 due to a steady source @xmath57",

    "the particle density and flux undergo the same exponential reduction along the ray .",

    "it is not immediately clear that ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) is in this form . to see the connection define @xmath88 , where @xmath62 was given by ( [ eq : 2.15 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) can then be expressed in a form similar to ( [ eq : 2.23 ] ) , where the large parameter is @xmath89 in the two - dimensional case , which is our primary concern , the magnitude of the flux onto the boundary @xmath13 is the magnitude of first component of @xmath90 . at position",

    "we might therefore expect the analysis in the preceding sections to be valid only when @xmath10 is nonsingular .",
    "however we now show that the results continue to hold for the case where @xmath10 is a rank one matrix .    in general",
    "since @xmath10 is symmetric it may be diagonalised by a suitable rotation of the axes . because we are , at this point , still considering a permeable boundary we can apply a rotation to diagonalise @xmath10 without loss of generality .",
    "we will therefore consider the case where @xmath10 is of the form @xmath95 and take the limit as @xmath96 .",

    "it is straightforward to perform a monte carlo simulation of the advection diffusion process with an absorbing boundary : the particles are simply removed from the simulation whenever they cross the boundary . in contrast",
    "when solving a fokker - planck equation , such as equation ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) for a particle density , it is not possible to write down a local boundary condition which implies that particles colliding with a boundary are absorbed .",
    "however , we can add an additional source term to the fokker - planck equation and , in principle , this allows us to describe an absorbing boundary by adding a suitable source of antiparticles at the boundary .",
    "after emission at the boundary the antiparticles propagate in the same way as particles do but , to model absorption , the antiparticle density is subtracted from the particle density . since",
    "this approach does not rely on any geometrical symmetries of the system it is more general than approaches which use the method of images .",
    "in the two - dimensional case suppose that position on the boundary @xmath112 can be parameterised by the arc length @xmath113 and let @xmath114 be the rate of antiparticle creation _ per unit length",
