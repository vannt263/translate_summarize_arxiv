    "in the last years the study of our universe has received a great deal of attention since on the one hand fundamental theoretical questions remain unanswered and on the other hand we have now the opportunity to measure the cosmological parameters with an extraordinary precision .",
    "existing observational experiments involve measurement on cmb or large scale structure lss or supernovae sn1a , and new proposals are carried out .",
    "it has been established that our universe is flat and dominated at present time by dark energy `` de '' and dark matter `` dm '' with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and curvature @xmath16 . however , the nature and dynamics of dark energy is a topic of mayor interest in the field .",
    "the equation of state `` eos '' of de is at present time @xmath17 but we do not have a precise measurements of @xmath18 as a function of redshift @xmath19 . since the properties of dark energy are still under investigation , different de parametrization have been proposed to help discern on the dynamics of de - .",
    "some of these de parametrization have the advantage of having a reduced number of parameters , but they may lack of a physical motivation and may also be too restrictive . furthermore , the evolution of de may not be enough to distinguish between different models and the perturbations of de may be fundamental to differentiate them .",
    "perhaps the best physically motivated candidates for dark energy are scalar fields which can be minimally coupled , only via gravity , to other fluids or can interact weakly in interacting dark energy `` ide '' .",
    "scalar fields have been widely studied in the literature and special interest was devoted to tracker fields since in this case the behavior of the scalar field @xmath20 is very weakly dependent on the initial conditions at a very early epoch and well before matter - radiation equality . in this class of models",
    "the fundamental question of why de is relevant now , also called the coincidence problem , can be ameliorated by the insensitivity of the late time dynamics on the initial conditions of @xmath20 . however , at present time we are not concern at this stage with the initial conditions but we work from present redshift @xmath21 to larger values of @xmath19 in the region where de and its perturbations are relevant . in this case the conditions for tracker fields do not necessarily apply .",
    "interesting models for de and dm have been proposed using gauge groups , similar to qcd in particle physics , and have been studied to understand the nature of dark energy and also dark matter .    here",
    "we propose a new de parametrization based on scalar fields dynamics , but the parametrization of @xmath11 can be used without the connection to scalar fields .",
    "this parametrization has a reach structure that allows @xmath11 to have different evolutions and it may grow and later decrease or other way around .",
    "we also determine the perturbations of de which together with the evolution of the homogenous part can single out the nature of de . with the underlying connection between the evolution of @xmath11 and the dynamics of scalar field we could determine the potential @xmath13 .",
    "the same motivation of parameterizing the evolution of scalar field was presented in an interesting paper .",
    "we share the same motivation but we follow a different path which has the same number of parameters but it has a richer structure and it is easier to extract information on the scalar potential @xmath13 .",
    "we organized the work as follows : in sec.[ow ] we give a brief overview of our de parametrization . in sec.[sfd ] we present the dynamics of a scalar field and the set up for our de parametrization presented in sec.[sfp ] .",
    "we calculate the de perturbations in sec.[sec.pert ] and finally we conclude in sec.[con ] .",
    "we present here an overview of our @xmath11 parametrization .",
    "the eos is w==. with @xmath22 the ratio of kinetic energy and potential .",
    "the equation of motion of the scalar field gives ( c.f .",
    "eq.([x3 ] ) ) , x=. where @xmath23 , @xmath24 the ratio of matter and @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "eq.([xo ] ) is an exact equation and is valid for any fluid evolution and/or for arbitrary potentials @xmath13 .",
    "the aim of our proposed parametrization for @xmath26 is to cover a wide range od de behavior .",
    "of course other interesting parameterizations are possible . from the dynamics of scalar fields",
    "we know that the evolution of @xmath11 close to present time is very model dependent .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath27 , used as a model of de derived from gauge theory , the shape of @xmath18 close to present time depends on the initial conditions and it may grow or decrease as a function of redshift @xmath19 .",
    "of course if we change the potential the sensitivity on the choice of @xmath3 and initial conditions will vary a lot .",
    "we also know that tracker fields are attractor solutions but in most cases they do not give a negative enough @xmath28 .",
    "the dynamics of scalar fields with a single potential term , for a wide class of models , gives an accelerating universe only if @xmath29 or to a constant @xmath30 with @xmath31 . in this class of models",
    "the eos , regardless of its initial value , goes to a period of kinetic domination where @xmath32 and later has a steep transition to @xmath33 , which may be close to present time , and finally it grows to @xmath28 in a very model and initial condition dependent .",
    "furthermore , if instead of having a single potential term we have two competing terms close to present time , the evolution of @xmath18 would even be more complicated . therefore , instead of deriving the potential @xmath3 from theoretical models as in we propose to use an ansatz for the functions @xmath26 which on the one hand should cover as wide as possible the different classes of de behavior with the least number of parameters , without sacrificing generality , and on the other hand we like to have the ansatz as close as possible to the know scalar field dynamics .",
    "we believe that using or model will greatly simplify the extraction od de from the future observational data .",
    "we propose therefore the ansatz ( c.f .",
    "eq.([ll ] ) ) l=&&l_o+l_1 y^f(a)=l_o+l_1 y_o^ ( ) + f(a)=&&= where @xmath34 are free parameters giving @xmath28 and @xmath35 at early times , @xmath36 is a function that goes from @xmath37 at @xmath21 to @xmath38 and @xmath39 sets the transition redshift between @xmath28 and @xmath40 ( a subscript @xmath41 represents present time quantities ) while @xmath42 the steepness of the transition and @xmath43 takes only two values @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "we show that a steep transition of @xmath11 has a bump in the adiabatic sound speed @xmath46 which could be detected in large scale structure .",
    "since the universe is accelerating at present time we may take the slow roll approximation where @xmath47 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , the derivation of @xmath10 in eq.([xo ] ) is exact and has no approximation",
    ". we will show in section [ sfp ] that @xmath11 can have a wide range of behavior and in particular it can decrease and later increasing as a function of redshift and viceversa , i.e the shape and steepness are not predetermined by the choice of parametrization .",
    "of course we could use other parametrization since the evolution of @xmath48 and @xmath11 in eqs.([wo ] ) and ( [ xo ] ) are fully valid .",
    "there is also no need to have any reference to the underlying scalar field dynamics , i.e. it is not constraint to scalar field dynamics .",
    "however , it is when we interpret @xmath49 with @xmath23 and the ratio @xmath24 that we connect the evolution of @xmath11 to the scalar potential @xmath13 .",
    "we are interested in obtaining a new de parametrization inferred from scalar fields .",
    "since it is derived from the dynamics of a scalar field @xmath20 we can also determine its perturbations which are relevant in large scale structure formation .",
    "we start from the equation of motion for a canonical scalar field @xmath50 with a potential @xmath13 in a frw metric .",
    "the homogenous part of @xmath20 has an equation of motion + 3h+v()=0 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the hubble constant , @xmath53 is the scale factor with @xmath54 and a dot represents derivative with respect to time @xmath55 . since we are interested in the epoch for small @xmath19 we only need to consider matter and de and we have 3h^2=+in natural units @xmath56 .",

    "however , in the present work we do not want to study the critical points but the evolution of @xmath48 close to present time when the universe is accelerating with @xmath48 close to zero ( @xmath11 close to -1 ) but not exactly zero with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath105 , since we expect @xmath20 to roll down the minimum of its potential , and the second term in eq.([dx ] ) is then negative , while @xmath106 can take either sign . in the region where @xmath107 we have @xmath108",
