    "the dynamical analysis of rotation curves of galaxies , binary galaxies , clusters of galaxies and the structures known at large scales show large discrepancies between the observed behaviour and the one expected from the application of general relativity and its newtonian limit to the visible mass .",
    "this disagreement has led many astrophysicists to believe in the existence of a large amount of non - visible matter and is , thus , commonly known as the _ dark matter problem_.    in spite of this , there is no direct evidence for the validity of either einstein s general relativity or newtonian gravity at scales much larger than those of the solar system ( see , e.g. , will @xcite ) .",
    "there is therefore no experimental or observational reason to ascertain that unmodified general relativity holds at larger distances .",
    "this leads us to think that we should be open to the possibility that it had to be revised ( perhaps in the same spirit as newton s law had to be modified for strong fields and large velocities ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the possibility that newton s law of gravity is just a good approximation at short distances of a more general expression for the force .",
    "it is interesting to identify which , if any , extensions of the usual inverse square law are compatible with the dynamics observed at large scales",
    ".    work along these lines has already been done ( tolhine @xcite , kuhn & kruglyak @xcite , mannheim & kazanas @xcite ) assuming a specific functional form for the force , and then evaluating the field generated by a mass distribution ( for instance , a galaxy ) by performing the corresponding three - dimensional integrals .",
    "we present and work out a method that allows us to follow the inverse methodology , that is , to infer , directly from observations , the phenomenological law of gravity that is able to generate a given macroscopic gravitational field .",
    "we do it for the case of a spherical mass distribution with exponential density .",
    "in section [ sec : general ] we give the general definitions that will be used later in section [ sec : spherical ] for the case of spherical symmetry with exponential density . in section [ sec : development ] we show the mathematical basis underlying the results presented in section [ sec : spherical ] . finally we offer some conclusions . in appendix",
    "[ app : diskvsesf ] we consider the possibility of applying these results as an approximation to the study of spiral galaxies overcoming the fact that they do not show spherical symmetry . in appendix",
    "[ app : math ] we list some of the mathematical identities used in section [ sec : development ] .",
    "let us assume that the gravitational potential generated by a point - like mass does not correspond to the usual newtonian form but can be written in terms of a function @xmath0 that describes the deviation from the newtonian law , that is ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the gravitational potential experienced by two point - like particles of masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 separated by a distance @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the newton s constant .",
    "this modification could , for example , be due to the many body nature of the mass distribution making up the galaxy , quantum corrections , a relativistic theory different from general relativity ... this is irrelevant in what follows .",
    "the force per unit mass is , by definition , the gradient of the potential ,    @xmath7    where we have introduced    @xmath8    in this way , to find the total potential or the total force generated by a mass distribution @xmath9 with density @xmath10 , one must integrate over the volume spanned by @xmath9 to get :    @xmath11    for the potential experienced by a point mass at a distance @xmath12 from the centre of @xmath9 , and @xmath13 for the force .    in the case that the gravitational potential is only a function of the distance to the centre of the distribution ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce two new functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that :    @xmath16    @xmath17    and the rotation velocity of a test particle in a circular orbit bound to the distribution will be : @xmath18 where the auxiliary functions @xmath15 and @xmath14 satisfy the following functional relationship :    @xmath19    our goal is to design a procedure where , assuming that @xmath20 is known ( say from observation of the rotation velocity ) for all values of @xmath12 , we obtain a @xmath21 that generates the given rotation velocity . or , in other words , given the potential as inferred from observations we want to find which @xmath0 could have generated it .",
    "actually , what we will find are @xmath0 and @xmath21 as functions of @xmath15 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "in view of the applications that we have in mind , we study a spherically symmetric distribution with an exponentially decaying density :    @xmath22    our ultimate goal is to find a method to study the discrepancies between the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the curves predicted by using newton s law of gravity .",
    "the luminosity profile of many spiral galaxies can be well fitted assuming that the density of luminous matter decreases exponentially with distance from the centre of the galaxy ( kent @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason why we are interested in studing such a density function , even though spiral galaxies are not spherical .    using eqs .",

    "( [ potomeg ] ) and ( [ forceomeg ] ) , and considering spherical symmetry , the two problems sketched in section [ sec : general ] can be conveniently recast in the form of two integral equations :    \\(i ) given @xmath14 , find a function @xmath0 that satisfies the equation :    @xmath23    and    \\(ii ) given @xmath15 , find a function @xmath21 such that :    @xmath24    in the next section the solution to these integral equations will be described in detail .",

    "we have found the _ exact _ solution to the problem of inverting the integral relation between the elemental law of gravity and the gravitational field generated by a spherical mass distribution .",
    "we have arrived at a direct and simple expression which can be useful in order to infer the law of gravity that could explain the large scale gravitational behaviour if we had good data on rotation curves of spherical galaxies with an exponential density profile .",
    "however , most of the observational data available on rotation curves are for spiral galaxies .",
    "despite the fact , shown in appendix [ app : diskvsesf ] , that this formalism is a good approximation to study this class of galaxies if @xmath48 is a growing function of @xmath5 , we believe that it is better to study the case of a thin disk distribution that is a much better approximation to the real morphology of spiral galaxies . in two forthcoming publications we will give a similar solution for a thin - disk distribution ( rodrigo - blanco @xcite ) and we will apply it to real galaxies ( rodrigo - blanco & prez - mercader @xcite ) .",
    "0= 0    at first sight , we would think that we can not apply the results of the previous sections to spiral galaxies , because they have been obtained assuming spherical symmetry , and spiral galaxies are disk - shaped , not spherical . in spite of this , it seems logical that the difference between the gravitational field generated by a sphere and the one generated by a disk becomes negligible at very large distances ( here  large distances \" means large compared with some typical length scale for the distribution ; it could be , for instance , @xmath52 , i.e , the exponential length scale of the mass distribution ) . furthermore , when we consider the effect of an increasing @xmath21 , it is evident that the meaning of what is a ",
    "large distance \" changes as we change the functional form of @xmath21 .",
    "that is , the faster @xmath21 grows as a function of @xmath5 , the smaller the distance at which a sphere is indistinguishable from a disk becomes , when considered from the gravitational point of view .    in order to obtain a more quantitative idea of the gravitational difference between a sphere and a disk , when @xmath48 is a growing function of its argument , we have chosen a parametric family of @xmath48 s given by :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 parameterizes how fast @xmath48 grows .",
    "then we have calculated the rotation velocity performing the three - dimensional integral numerically for several values of @xmath54 .",
    "we have done it both for the case of spherical symmetry , and for the case of cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we have assumed for the disk a small thickness of @xmath55 , and the rotation velocity is calculated in the plane of the disk .    in figure ( [ discesf ] ) , we have plotted both velocities for a disk as well as for a sphere for some values of @xmath54 . in each case",
    "we have normalized the solutions dividing by a convenient constant @xmath56 defined as :    @xmath57    it can be seen that both curves tend to merge as @xmath54 increases .",
    "however , we would like to have a more quantitative way of describing the difference between both curves as a function of @xmath54 . in order to do this , we define a quantity @xmath58 ( see below for its meaning ) as follows :    @xmath59    here the subscripts @xmath60 and @xmath61 stand for ` disk ' and ` sphere ' , respectively .",
    "we sum over @xmath62 , which are the points where the integrals are calculated .",
    "the total number of points for each value of @xmath54 is @xmath63 .    because of the way it is defined , @xmath64 is a measure of the mean square error that we make in the rotation velocity if we consider a sphere instead of the real disk , for each value of @xmath54 .",
    "we thus aim for a value as small as posible for @xmath58 . in figure ( [ sigmad ] )",
    ", we plot the value of @xmath58 versus @xmath54 . once again",
    ", it can be seen that the larger the value of @xmath54 is , the smaller the difference .",
    "considering what these plots mean , we see that our mathematical results can be used in the case of spiral galaxies , with a good level of confidence , provided @xmath21 grows fast enough with @xmath5 .",
    "actually , the most popular corrections to @xmath65 that can be found in the literature are @xmath66 , ( see tohline @xcite and khun & kruglyak @xcite ) , and @xmath67 , ( see mannheim & kazanas @xcite ) . it can be seen in the figures that the approximation is quite good in both cases . although the results obtained in this way are not , they give a qualitatively correct picture .",
