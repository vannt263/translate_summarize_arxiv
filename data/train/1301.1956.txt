    "this curved edge is also observed when achiral rods are studied . for achiral viruses",

    "this optimal value of @xmath47 is not arbitrarily large because a large value would lead to a large deformation in the director field in the neighborhood of the cusp .",

    "the contributions to the free energy from the frank , gaussian curvature and edge energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : termcookie](b ) .",
    "larger bulges introduce larger deformations in the director field far from the cusps because the directors are forced to follow a more curved edge at the boundary , but larger bulges can also reduce the mismatch between the directors near the cusps by forcing the directors on both sides of the cusps to become more parallel .",

    "while squeezing the cusps into a small segment of the edge creates a flatter segment elsewhere which reduces the frank free energy there , it also creates a more curved geometry in the region where the cusps are located which increases the frank free energy in that location . from the general trend of the frank free energy shown in the figure",
    ", we see that the latter effect overcomes the former so that the frank free energy increases as the cusps are brought together .",

    "in most of the metastable region , the energy barrier between the perfectly flat , round disks and the `` crenellated disk '' is about several frank constants corresponding to several hundred @xmath90 in physical units .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the transition from large , flat disks to twisted ribbons in the elastic theory was determined to occur at @xmath91 and @xmath92 , corresponding to the very bottom edge of the metastable region of our phase diagram .",

    "the gaussian curvature modulus has not been measured experimentally , though there is some evidence @xcite that suggests its value is larger , possibly by one order of magnitude , than the value found in the theory of ref .",
    "thus , in our phase diagram we have explored values of @xmath6 and @xmath11 larger than those used to analyze the twisted ribbon . in the latter analysis",
    "free boundary conditions were used for the orientation of the _ fd _ viruses at the edge of the monolayer which leads to a tilt angle @xmath13 at the edge which is significantly smaller than the @xmath93 measured experimentally . in the present case we imposed a @xmath93 tilt at the edge both to fit the experimental observations and to incorporate a nonzero tilt in an achiral model which",
    "otherwise would have zero tilt ( at least for the simple edge model used here and in ref .",

    "we can not exclude the possibility that `` crenellated disks '' with larger values of these parameters can be stable or metastable outside of the stable and metastable regions shown in the figure , but we have not explored this possibility due to the limitation of our computational resources .",
    "the `` crenellated '' region obtained by our current computations is quite possibly an underestimate .",
    "kaplan and meyer @xcite have recently considered a model of an array of cusps on the edge of a flat membrane in the absence of the director field .",
    "each cusp is modeled as a generic surface of revolution with negative gaussian curvature ( this model does not include the decaying exponential of eq .",
    "( [ equ : defects ] ) so as to maximize the saddle characteristics of the geometry ) . by simultaneously optimizing the shape of the surface and its free edges kaplan and meyer",
    "obtain an analytic relation between @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath59 , which for @xmath94 yields : @xmath95 . in the achiral limit their analysis of the energy of an array of cusps yields a transition to a `` crenellated disk '' with @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , in dimensionless units , of the same order of magnitude as our results .",
    "we have used an elastic theory of sm-_a _ monolayers to study a model @xcite of the `` crenellated disks '' observed in achiral mixtures of _ fd _ viruses .",
    "the theory is the achiral limit of one used earlier @xcite to describe flat disks and twisted ribbons in chiral _ fd _ monolayers . using mc simulations we computed the geometric parameters of the `` crenellated disks '' , the director field of the viruses and the relative stability of the disks .",
    "the height of the cusps was found to be in good agreement with experimental observation . although we obtained a smaller radial protrusion compared to experiments , our theoretical prediction is still reasonable noting the smaller size of the disks we have used in our calculations .",
    "the director field is also in good agreement with experimental birefringence measurements .",
    "the `` crenellated disks '' are found to be stable in a region where the gaussian curvature modulus @xmath11 and @xmath6 are both one order of magnitude higher than the value previously obtained when the elastic theory was applied to twisted ribbons .",
    "however , the metastable region does include the values of the moduli used to describe ribbons .",
