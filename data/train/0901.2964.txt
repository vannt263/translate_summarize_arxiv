    "the confined phase of @xmath0 yang - mills theory can be described by an effective theory coupling magnetic @xmath0 gauge potentials @xmath2 to three adjoint representation higgs fields @xcite . in the confined phase the magnetic gauge symmetry",
    "is completely broken via a dual higgs mechanism in which all particles become massive . the value @xmath3 of the magnetic higgs condensate is determined by the location of the minimum in the higgs potential , and the dual gluon acquires a mass @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic gauge coupling constant .",
    "the coupling of the potentials @xmath2 to the magnetically charged higgs fields generates color magnetic currents which , via a dual meissner effect , confine @xmath6 electric flux to narrow tubes connecting a quark - antiquark pair @xcite . for @xmath7 , the dual gluon mass @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the effective theory is applicable at distances greater than the flux tube radius @xmath9 . since @xmath7 lattice simulations",
    "@xcite yield a deconfinement temperature @xmath10 , the scale @xmath11 .",
    "thus there is a range of temperatures within the interval @xmath12 where the effective theory should also be applicable in the deconfined phase .",
    "above @xmath13 the higgs condensate vanishes , so the magnetic gluon becomes massless .",
    "we assume that the higgs fields do not play an essential role in the deconfined phase @xcite .",
    "the effective theory then reduces to pure su(n ) yang - mills theory of magnetic gauge potentials @xmath14 .",
    "this theory has the same form as the microscopic electric theory , but with a fixed gauge coupling constant @xmath15 and fixed ultraviolet cutoff @xmath16 , values determined by the effective theory description of the confined phase .",
    "the resulting long wavelength magnetic gluons , which at @xmath17 confine @xmath6 electric flux , are the elementary degrees of freedom for @xmath18 .",
    "we regard magnetic @xmath0 gauge theory as an effective field theory appropriate for calculating the long distance magnetic response of the gluon plasma .",

    "we use effective magnetic yang - mills theory to calculate spatial wilson loops measuring @xmath6 magnetic flux @xmath24 passing through a loop @xmath25 .",
    "these loops are obtained from the partition function of the magnetic theory in the presence of a current of @xmath24 quarks circulating around the loop @xmath25 , producing a steady current @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a diagonal matrix with the property @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this current is the source of an external magnetostatic scalar potential , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the solid angle subtended at the point @xmath31 by a surface @xmath32 bounded by the loop @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath33 , the biot - savart magnetic field of the current loop . ( the color magnetic field @xmath34 . ) the spatial wilson loop of yang - mills theory , calculated in the effective magnetic gauge theory , is then the partition function of the magnetic theory in the presence of the external potential @xmath35 .",
    "to evaluate the partition function of the magnetic theory in the deconfined phase , where there is no higgs potential , we must calculate the one loop effective potential @xmath36 of magnetic yang - mills theory in the background of a static magnetic scalar potential @xmath37 :    @xmath38    @xmath36 is the counterpart in the deconfined phase of the classical higgs potential generating electric flux tube solutions in the confined phase , and gives rise to the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath6 symmetry of the effective magnetic gauge theory .",
    "we evaluate @xmath36 integrating over the massless modes of magnetic yang - mills theory , introducing a pauli - villars regulator mass @xmath39 .",
    "this mass should approximately be equal to the dual gluon mass @xmath40 determining the maximum energy of the modes included in the effective theory . aside from the presence of the regulator , the calculation of @xmath36 mimics the calculation @xcite of the one loop effective potential @xmath41 in yang - mills theory used @xcite to calculate the spatial t hooft loop @xcite .",
    "we assume that the background potential @xmath37 has the same abelian color structure as @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless effective potential @xmath43 is then a periodic function of @xmath44 with period @xmath45 .",

    "the integral @xmath51 suppresses the short distance contribution to @xmath52 .",
    "we separate the background scalar potential @xmath44 into the contribution @xmath53 of the external potential and a remaining contribution @xmath54 whose sources are the magnetic charges of the plasma : @xmath55 then making the replacement ( [ c0 ] ) in @xmath56 and adding the magnetic energy @xmath57 of the induced magnetic charges gives the effective action @xmath58 : @xmath59 } \\ , .",

    "( [ s1loop ] ) and ( [ seff ] ) .",
    "for @xmath61 the scale @xmath60 is greater than the cutoff @xmath39 so that we can use @xmath62 at the classical level to determine the leading long distance behavior of spatial wilson loops in the deconfined phase in the same manner that the classical gauge - higgs action was used to evaluate temporal wilson loops in the confined phase .",
    "the minimization of @xmath58 yields `` poisson s equation '' for @xmath54 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the color magnetic charge density induced in the vacuum by the current loop .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath54 are : for @xmath65 on @xmath25 , @xmath66 , and as @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "the temperature dependence of the ratio @xmath89 comes from the pauli - villars cutoff , which suppresses the contributions of momenta greater than @xmath39 to the effective potential ( [ u ] ) and consequently to @xmath90 .",
    "since the pauli - villars regulator is rather `` soft '' , allowing substantial contributions from momenta greater than @xmath39 , we have also evaluated the string tension using values of @xmath39 smaller than @xmath91 . in fig .",

    "the induced distributions @xmath98 of magnetic charge have maxima for values of @xmath86 close to @xmath99 .",
    "this can be understood since @xmath100 is the shortest wavelength of the quanta contributing to @xmath101 and hence determines the spatial extension of the magnetically charged objects described by effective theory .",
    "their `` size '' @xmath100 is greater than the magnetic screening length @xmath102 determining the exponential tail of the charge distributions as @xmath103 .    in a dilute plasma of charged ions",
    "the size of the ion cloud is determined by the debye screening length which is much larger than the mean separation between the ions . by contrast , in the gluon plasma the mean distance between the extended charges , determined by their intrinsic size @xmath104 , is greater than the screening length characterizing the tail of the distribution .",
    "this gives a physical picture of the gluon plasma as a dense ( closely - packed ) liquid of extended magnetically charged objects .",
    "comparison of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] with correlation functions calculated in lattice simulations of yang - mills theory @xcite could check this picture .",
    "according to our picture , the plasma phase of @xmath0 yang - mills theory in a temperature range included the interval @xmath105 is described by effective magnetic @xmath0 gauge theory . integrating out the long wavelength non - abelian degrees of freedom",
    "gives rise to extended magnetic charges confining magnetic flux , which are the counterpart in the deconfined phase of magnetic currents confining electric flux in the confined phase .",
