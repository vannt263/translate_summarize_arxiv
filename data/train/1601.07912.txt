    "moreover , the amplitude of a thermal perturbation responsible for spiral development is given by @xmath91 ( see next section ) , therefore , in an equilibrium situation in which @xmath92 , the assumption of a constant opacity results in a thermal amplitude perturbation independent of the opacity choice .",

    "projected shadows act as forcing perturbations , which efficiently and independently of the presence of random source of symmetry breaking ( e.g. , gravitational instabilities ) , produce spirals .",
    "because of the point - symmetric nature of this perturbation , density waves are excited with @xmath6 morphology . each shadow appears to trigger one spiral arm .    shortly after the shadows have been cast onto the disk , and before the disk thermalizes , the gas pressure ( eq .  [ state1 ] )",

    "figure  [ grad ] shows the azimuthal pressure acceleration , @xmath111 , after 30 orbits for two @xmath110 disk models with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , middle and right panels , respectively .",
    "the pressure acceleration magnitude increases with stellar irradiation : the maximum value for the pressure acceleration increases from @xmath114 to @xmath115 when the stellar irradiation passes from @xmath9 ( middle ) to @xmath99 ( right panel ) .",
    "as the gas in the disk flows around the star ( in anticlockwise direction for all figures ) , it periodically enters and exits shadowed regions . at the interfaces between shadowed and fully illuminated sections , the gas is subjected to an _ azimuthal acceleration _ due to pressure gradients ( i.e. , @xmath116 ) .",
    "as the gas enters a shadowed region ( coming from high to low pressure ) , it experiences a positive azimuthal acceleration ( anticlockwise ) . on the other hand , as it exits the shadow ( moving from low to high pressure ) , the gas experiences a negative azimuthal acceleration ( clockwise ) .",
    "the difference between the gain and loss of azimuthal acceleration is uneven , resulting in a net azimuthal acceleration in the anticlockwise direction ( gas rotation direction ) , which varies with radius within the first @xmath050  au .",
    "this creates a strong source of axisymmetry breaking , locally pushing the gas to move faster around the central star at the inner regions of the disk , piling up material at the shadows frontier close to this inner region , which then leads to the formation of a trailing mode spiral - like structures outspread by differential rotation .",
    "gas pressure acceleration depends on stellar luminosity as more luminous stars feed more energy into their disks , rising the temperature of the illuminated sections while leaving the shadowed region unaffected .",
    "this produces a higher contrasts in the pressure field .",
    "this is the reason why spirals appear early ( @xmath117 orbits ) in models with @xmath99 , when compared to 1  l@xmath86 models in which the first spirals emerge only after @xmath104 orbits .",
    "the key factor is the contrast in pressure between dark and illuminated regions .    depending on the gas cooling time",
    ", thermal perturbations can wear off over time .",
    "as the disk thermalises , the illumination pattern becomes less effective at forcing a perturbation on the gas . in our simulations , this tendency to homogenize is seen after @xmath118 orbits .",
    "ultimately , the induced spiral arms tend to blend and lose contrast with the background gas unless gravitational instabilities kick in . in these large viscous time - scales ,",
    "gi induced spiral structures are expected to remain quasi - steadily ( e.g. dipierro et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "gravitational instabilities can be locally characterized by the toomre parameter should be replaced by the _ epicyclic frequency @xmath89 _ , defined by @xmath119 . in our case , @xmath120 . ] given by @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 correspond to sound speed , angular velocity and surface density , respectively @xcite .",

    "it is important to remark that spiral structures emerge even if we disable self - gravity from our simulations .",
    "the shadow - induced spirals do not require the presence of gravitational instabilities for their development .",
    "we input our simulations into a 3d radiative transfer code to produce scattered light predictions in @xmath3-band ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "we used the radmc3ddullemond / software / radmc-3d/ ] code ( version 0.39 ) , assuming that the dust follows the same density field as the gas in the simulation , with a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 .",
    "the dust distribution model consists of a mix of two common species : amorphous carbon and astronomical silicates .",
    "we used mie model ( homogeneous spheres ) to compute dust opacities for anisotropic scattering ( bohren , c. & huffman , d. r. 1983 ) .",
    "the optical constants for amorphous carbon ( intrinsic grain densities 2  g  @xmath133 ) were taken from @xcite , and for silicates ( intrinsic grain densities 4  g  @xmath133 ) from @xcite .    to produce a 3d volume ,",
    "the vertical density structure was solved assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",

    "we also obtain observable spiral structures in @xmath135-band .",
    "the scattered light spirals follow the same equation as the one obtained from the density field , i.e. , @xmath136 ( see figure [ dens1 ] , bottom row , orbit 3500 , and/or table [ spiral_table ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the assumption of _ hydrostatic equilibrium _ in two - dimensional models likely underestimates the contrast of spirals images when compared with with full 3d hydrodynamical models ( zhu et al .",
    "2015 ) . in that case , the illumination effects impacting the disk should produce even more prominent scattered light images of spirals than those reported here .",
    "we investigated the hydrodynamical consequences of illumination effects in transitional disks , such as shadows cast onto a circumstellar disk , focusing on the development of spiral structures .",
    "the evolution of a passive disk was calculated using 2d hydro - simulations including stellar irradiation values of 1 and 100 @xmath137 , and with two point - symmetric shadows cast within an opening angle of 28@xmath1 for disk masses of @xmath11 and @xmath138  m@xmath77 .",
    "pressure gradients due to temperature differences between obscured and illuminated regions induce spiral structures in the density field .",
    "these spirals emerge independent of whether self - gravity is enabled or not .",
    "the structures observed in the density field can be characterized by an archimedean spiral which attain nearly constant pitch angles @xmath011@xmath1 - 14@xmath1 , and extend from @xmath060  au to the outer disk rim .",
    "radiative transfer calculations , for a model with @xmath110 disk mass and stellar irradiation of @xmath80 , predict that these shadow - induced spirals should be detectable in @xmath3-band scattered light images .    recently , @xcite presented an analytical study of the effect of density waves on proto - planetary disks .",
    "they found that density waves with contrast of order unity , such as the ones resulting from our models , produce an enhancement in the accretion rate that could explain the large cavities observed in some transition disks . in hd  142527 , the inner disk casts a shadow that explains the observed dips in the outer disk @xcite , and , as shown in this letter , drives spiral waves @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the enhanced accretion produced by these spirals could have depleted the inner @xmath0100  au of this disk .",
    "the hd  100453 disk @xcite , which we suggest bears strong similarities to hd  142527 as spirals are seen to stem away from dark regions in the outer disk , might also fit in this scenario .",

    "<S> circumstellar asymmetries such as central warps have recently been shown to cast shadows on outer disks . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the hydrodynamical consequences of such variable illumination on the outer regions of a transition disk , and the development of spiral arms . using 2d simulations , we follow the evolution of a gaseous disk passively heated by the central star , under the periodic forcing of shadows with an opening angle of @xmath028@xmath1 . with a lower pressure under the shadows , each crossing results in a variable azimuthal acceleration , which in time develops into spiral density waves . </S>",
    "<S> their pitch angles evolves from @xmath2 at onset , to @xmath011@xmath1 - 14@xmath1 , over @xmath065  au to 150  au . </S>",
    "<S> self - gravity enhances the density contrast of the spiral waves , as also reported previously for spirals launched by planets . </S>",
    "<S> our control simulations with unshadowed irradiation do not develop structures , except a different form of spiral waves seen at later times only in the gravitationally unstable control case . </S>",
    "<S> scattered light predictions in @xmath3 band show that such illumination spirals should be observable . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that spiral arms in the case - study transition disk hd  142527 could be explained as a result of shadowing from the tilted inner disk . </S>"
