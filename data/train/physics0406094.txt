    "_ this work was presented on `` the eighth european conference on atomic and molecular physics '' ( ecampviii ) ( rennes , france , july 6 - 10 , 2004 ) and on the `` electronic structure simulations of nanostructures '' workshop ( essn2004 ) ( jyvskyl finland , june 18 - 21 , 2004 ) . _ +   + amino acids are building blocks for proteins .",
    "recently , it became possible to study experimentally fragments of proteins , i.e. chains of amino acids , in a gas phase with the use of the maldi mass spectroscopy @xcite . _",
    "ab initio _ theoretical investigations of amino acid chains began also only recently @xcite and are still in its infancy . in this work",
    "we have performed for the first time a systematic analysis of the dissociation and fission pathways of neutral , singly and doubly charged alanine dipeptide ions with the aim to identify the fission mechanism and the most probable fragmentation channels of these type of molecules .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of rearrangement of the molecule structure during the fission process . this rearrangement may include transition to another isomer or a quasi - molecular state before actual separation of the daughter fragments begins .",
    "our exploration of the energetics and the pathways of the fragmentation process is based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) and the post - hartree - fock many - body perturbation theory accounting for all electrons in the system . within the dft one has to solve the kohn - sham equations , which read as ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath0    where the first term represents the kinetic energy of the @xmath1-th electron , and @xmath2 describes its attraction to the ions in the cluster , @xmath3 is the hartree part of the interelectronic interaction : @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the electron density : @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the local exchange - correlation potential , @xmath8 are the electronic orbitals and @xmath9 is the number of electrons in the cluster .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange - correlation energy functional : @xmath10}{\\delta \\rho(\\vec r)},\\ ] ]    the approximate functionals employed by dft methods partition the exchange - correlation energy into two parts , referred to as exchange and correlation parts .",
    "both parts are the functionals of the electron density , which can be of two distinct types : either local functional depending on only the electron density @xmath11 or gradient - corrected functionals depending on both @xmath11 and its gradient , @xmath12 . in literature",
    ", there is a variety of exchange correlation functionals . in our work",
    "we use the becke s three parameter gradient - corrected exchange functional with the gradient - corrected correlation functional of lee , yang and parr ( b3lyp ) @xcite .",
    "we utilize the standard 6 - 31g(d ) basis set to expand the electronic orbitals @xmath8 .    to explore the energetic and the pathways of the fragmentation process we introduced the procedure which implies the calculation of the multidimensional potential energy surface .",
    "we increase the distance between the two fragments and calculate the multidimensional potential energy surface on each step .",
    "then we identify local minima on this surface for a given distance between the fragments , and so find the fragmentation pathways of the molecule .",
    "for our calculations we utilized the gaussian 03 software package @xcite .",
    "radical . ]      in our work we have investigated the fission process of the two types of the alanine dipeptide .",
    "the only difference between them is in the @xmath13 ending of the molecule , which could be terminated by the @xmath14 or @xmath15 radicals .",
    "the geometries of the optimized neutral and charged alanine dipeptides terminated with the @xmath15 and @xmath14 radicals are shown in figures [ geom_nh3 ] and [ geom_nh2 ] respectively . in figure [ geom_nh3 ]",
    "we number different fragmentation channels along the polypeptide chain by roman numerals .",
    "these fragmentation channels is a subject for investigation in our work .",
    "the dependence of the total energy of neutral and charged alanine dipeptide terminated by the @xmath15 radical as a function of distance @xmath16 between two fragments for various fragmentation channels is shown in the figures [ fig_0_i]-[fig_2_ii ] .",

    "our calculations show that the fragmentation of the alanine dipeptide is a nonmonotoneous process .",
    "the chain configuration of the neutral dipeptide appears to be not the ground state of the molecule as it is clear from the rearangement process occuring in the channels i and v. the dipeptide fragmentation process for these channels is exothermic .",
    "the single ionization of the chain configuration of the dipeptide increases its stability and the fragmentation process in this case becomes endothermic .",
    "the doubly charged alanine dipeptide however becomes unstable because of the coulomb repulsive forces .",
    "this fact is illustrated by the energy dependence on @xmath16 for channel ii . from this dependence",
    "it is seen that the total energy of the system in the final state of the fragmentation process decreases as compared to its initial state , which means that the doubly charged alanine dipeptide ion terminated with the @xmath15 radical is unstable towards fission , which should take place if the temperature of the molecule is sufficiently high .",
    "note that for many fragmentation channels the energy dependence exhibits a barrier calculation of which takes account of the molecular rearrangement .",
    "such rearrangement may occur before the actual separation of the daughter fragments begins .",
    "in many cases the rearrangement leads to the formation of a quasimolecular state ( see figures [ fig_0_i]-[fig_2_ii ] ) .",
    "fragmentation of the alanine dipeptide terminated with the @xmath14 radical occurs differently .",
    "thus the fragmentation of the doubly charged ions of this kind takes place without any fission barrier . in the figures [ fig_2_ii_nh2]-[fig_2_v_nh2 ] we present the dependence of the dipeptide energy on @xmath16 for the fission channel ii and v in which the energy release is maximum .",
