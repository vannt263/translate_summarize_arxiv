    "the images have original plate scales of 0.72@xmath21 and 0.61@xmath21 per pixel , respectively , and are then binned into @xmath22 pixels .",
    "because the wd 1145 + 017 observations began 4.5 months before the most favorable observing season , all observations were initially made at low elevations , where seeing was poor and the point - spread - function ( ` psf ' ) of star images was large .",
    "the psf underwent large changes during each observing session , so aperture photometry ( after bias , dark , and twilight flat calibrations were applied ) could not be performed with a single set of photometric apertures .",
    "instead , images were grouped by air mass and circular photometry radii were chosen to be a multiple ( typically 2.0 ) of a typical psf fwhm .",
    "for example , when the fwhm was 3.0@xmath21 , a circular photometry radius corresponding to 6.0@xmath21 was typically used for the photometric aperture , and therefore multiple aperture radii were often used to process the data for each observing session . for determining the sky background we typically employed an annulus width and gap width of 15@xmath21 each .",
    "a selection of photometric aperture sizes was evaluated for their effect on the light curve noise levels and estimated systematic errors , and a subjective choice was adopted that was appropriate for each air - mass segment of data .    the numbers of reference stars chosen for photometry measurement were within the range of 19 to 23 , depending on the stability of the field - of - view ( e.g. , tracking shortcomings occasionally caused some stars , meant for use as reference , to be outside the fov ) . at a later stage of analysis",
    "we evaluated the contribution of each reference star to the light curve noise level , and a subset of typically 18 reference stars was adopted for final use . since much of the data were taken at high air mass , the effect of red stars for calibrating a blue target star was a serious concern , and this situation was avoided .",
    "the uncertainty of the wd 1145 + 017 ( target star ) magnitude measurements was estimated with a `` neighbor difference '' method that we describe below ( gary 2014 ) .",
    "nearby stars that were slightly brighter than the target were analyzed , and a standard error ( ` se ' ) vs.  magnitude model was used to predict the se for each target star measurement .",
    "the neighbor difference method begins with squaring the difference of a star s magnitude with the average of the same star s temporal neighbor magnitudes , dividing by @xmath23 , and forming a running average for a couple dozen such values , after which the square - root is an estimate of that star s se .    on nights",
    "when observations were made by two or three observers we applied magnitude ( vertical ) offsets to the data so that the out - of - transit ( oot ) portions of the light curves matched .",
    "most of the @xmath018 reference stars had apass magnitudes ( g@xmath24 to i@xmath24 ) , and these were used to determine that wd 1145 + 017 had r@xmath24-mag = 17.22 during oot .",
    "a method equivalent to the standard `` ccd transformation equations '' was used , on the assumption of an adopted target star color ( g@xmath24- r@xmath25 ) .    whereas the gary and kaye observations were processed using the maxim dl program , which is popular with amateur observers , the observations by benni ( 28 cm and 35 cm ) and foote ( 40 cm ) were processed using aip4win , another program in common use by amateur observers .",
    "the numbers of reference stars for these observations were 5 and 1 , respectively .",
    "aperture photometry was performed and data files with julian date time tags , magnitudes , and ses were treated in a way similar to the above description . for these data the neighbor difference method was used to estimate ses for each target magnitude using target magnitudes , not nearby reference stars .",
    "this will overestimate the ses when the target undergoes abrupt changes , which is one shortcoming for these data sets .    a summary plot of all wd 1145 + 017 light curves is presented in fig .",

    "each night of data is stacked vertically below the next , with no spaces left for missing nights .",
    "the data are all phased with respect to the `` a '' period of 4.5004 hours ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : analysis ] for definition ) .",
    "significant dips are noticeable on virtually all nights where we used telescope apertures of 35 cm or greater . on some nights as many as 13 dip events are observed , with dip depths that can reach 60% .",
    "many , but certainly not all , of the dips tend to congregate within @xmath26 1/2 hour around phase 0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : data ] and table [ tbl : periods ] for definitions ) ; however , dips are also observed at numerous other phases about the orbit .",
    "in order to search for frequencies in our data set , we employed a number of standard algorithms , including a simple fft , a lomb - scargle transform with and without the inclusion of uncertainties on the individual data points , a stellingwerf periodogram ( stellingwerf 1978 ) , and a box least - squares transform ( ` bls ' ; kovcs et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the end , we chose the bls transform as the most robust for this data set , and for its ability to track narrow dipping features . somewhat surprisingly , the bls was actually less susceptible to the 1-day observing window function than was the lomb - scargle transform .",
    "the bls transform of the entire data set is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ls1 ] .",
    "we have labeled the more prominent peaks `` a '' in reference to the k2 period with the largest amplitude ( vanderburg et al .",

    "the number following the `` a '' denotes the particular sideband of the 1-day observing window .",
    "essentially all of the significant peaks in the bls transform result from the `` a '' period or its higher harmonics and sidebands of the 1-day observing window .",

    "[ fig : fold1 ] .",
    "the fold shows all the individual flux points so that the variations are evident , as well as a binned and averaged version of the lightcurve ( in 100 bins ) .",
    "the binned fold uses the relative uncertainties in the individual flux measurements ( see sect .  [",

    "( 2015 ) from the k2 observations .",
    "the `` a '' period determined from the k2 observation , coupled with the k2 phase zero , projects ahead to our ground - based observations such that it is @xmath29 cycle off our phase zero ( defined above ) with an uncertainty of @xmath30 cycle .",
    "this is based on the formal uncertainty of the k2 `` a '' period given in table [ tbl : periods ] which , in turn , is inferred from an uncertainty of @xmath31 minutes in the determination of the times of minima . this latter uncertainty is justified by the statistical precision of the k2 signal .",
    "however , due to the limited time resolution of k2 ( see below ) these observations were insensitive to the type of systematic and erratic behavior of the dips exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] . in light of this new understanding of the dip behavior",
    ", it seems reasonable that the uncertainty in the k2 `` a '' period ( vanderburg et al .",
    "2015 ) is actually an order of magnitude larger than cited in tables [ tbl : wd1145 ] and [ tbl : periods ] .",
    "thus , we can not uniquely infer the number of orbits over the @xmath32 cycles between the two sets of observations .",
    "therefore , it seems prudent to use the phase zero determined by the current observations as defined above and reported in table [ tbl : periods ] .",
    "we have convolved the folded light curve in fig.[fig : fold1 ] with the 29.4 min long cadence integration time of _ kepler _ to simulate what our ground - based data would have looked like if observed with k2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : convolve ] ) .",

    "[ fig : fold1 ] would be seen by _ kepler _ as a 10% deep dip centered on phase zero . during the @xmath02.5 months of the observations reported here",
    ", that dip depth varies from @xmath025% to 10% and back to 20% .",
    "this contrasts with the k2 depths that ranged from nearly 0% , to 2% , and to 1% over a similar @xmath02.6 month interval ; in other words , both the k2 and present data exhibit changes in gross activity level , but since the k2 data of @xmath01.5 years ago , the level of `` activity '' of the transits has increased by about an order of magnitude .      from an inspection of the raw flux data in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , as well as from the folded light curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fold1 ] , it is clear that there are numerous large dips occurring in this object at many different phases of the `` a '' period .",
    "therefore , in order to understand how the dip features evolve from night to night , we adopted the following approach which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxdec16 ] . here",
    "we plot the flux data from the single night of 2015 dec 16 obtained by two observers .",
    "the flux data are then fitted to a non - physical model consisting of a set of asymmetric hyperbolic secants : @xmath33^{-1 } \\label{eqn : ahs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the number of dips that are required to provide a good fit , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the characteristic egress and ingress times for each of the dips ( see rappaport et al .",
    "2014 ; croll et al .",
    "the fits were carried out with a levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( levenberg 1944 ; marquardt 1963 ) .",
    "the times of the dipping events are taken from the values of @xmath37 and their depths from the @xmath38 s .",
    "the fitting process was halted when all dips that appeared to be significant by eye had been found ; we roughly estimate that this equates to all dips with 4-@xmath39 significance or greater .",
    "we then use the derived times and depths of the various dips to construct a `` waterfall '' diagram to show how the phases of the dips , with respect to the `` a '' period , are changing from night to night .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] shows such a waterfall diagram constructed for the complete data set using the `` a '' period for the purpose of phasing the night - to - night dipping patterns .",
    "the data from each night are represented by a schematic diagram where the duration of the dip is indicated by the length of the blue segment , while the thickness of the symbol is proportional to the dip depth .",
    "we then connect the dips which we believe correspond to the same object , but observed on different nights .",
    "the vast majority of the dips are clearly drifting with respect to the nominal fold period ( `` a '' ) by an amount that corresponds to @xmath0@xmath40 minutes per day . the rms dispersion in this value is 0.5 minutes per day for the 15 linear drift patterns which exhibit this approximate drift rate .    in spite of the drifting nature of the features",
    ", we can see visually why the `` a '' period shows up in the bls transform .",
    "this is due to the fact that a substantial fraction of the dips , including most of the deeper ones , occur between phases @xmath41 .",
    "typically , a constant phase drift simply corresponds to an incorrect assumption about the period against which the data have been phased up .",
    "two and a half minutes per day corresponds to a `` adjusted '' period of 4.493 hours .",
    "we also show in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] a second waterfall plot , but this one is phased to the mean drift period .",
    "one can now see that there are clear sets of dipping events that become ` stacked ' vertically , or nearly so .",
    "the fact that there are still some residual drifting motions using this period indicates that the mean drift period is not a precisely constant period of the system .",
    "furthermore , we see no evidence for that period in any of the search algorithms we employed .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this : ( 1 ) there are so many dips over all orbital phases that the folded light curve does not develop enough of a depression at a specific orbital phase to reveal itself ; and/or ( 2 ) this is not a long - term stable period , but in fact is fundamentally related to the `` a '' period itself .",
    "there is clear evidence for the former hypothesis in the bottom panel of fig .",

    ", if the orbiting object completely disintegrates in a much shorter time , then the longer dynamical lifetime has no meaning .",
    "however , these dynamical lifetimes do suggest that the orbits are not significantly decaying while they are emitting dust .",
    "from a perusal of our observational results , we reach a number of empirical conclusions .",
    "first , there is only one period that is securely detected and appears not to be transient , and that is @xmath70 hours , which is consistent with the `` a '' period detected during the k2 observations .",
    "see table [ tbl : periods ] for a summary of all the periods associated with wd1145 + 017 .",
    "second , @xmath015 dip features drift with respect to the `` a '' period .",
    "the orbital periods of these non - permanent features of the system are _ all _ shorter than the `` a '' period by an average of about 1/2 minute ( out of an orbital period of 270 minutes ) , which agrees with the findings reported in croll et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and gnsicke et al .",
    "as far as we can determine , the drift rates of the different features are rather similar to each other , but are not all exactly the same ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : waterfall ] ) with a dispersion of @xmath020% .",
    "third , none of these shorter periods shows up robustly in any of the transforms ; but , to be fair , they are not , strictly speaking , ` resolvable ' in a data set that is only @xmath064 days long ( the interval when observing sessions provided complete orbital phase coverage , or nearly so ) .",
    "there is , however , sufficient accuracy in determining the periods that it would be straightforward to distinguish between the `` a '' period itself and the drift periods if _ only one or the other _ were present .",
    "fourth , at least some of the drifting dip features in the light curve seem to have limited lifetimes , perhaps of the order of a few weeks . finally , many of the individual dip features exhibit asymmetric profiles with the egress time generally longer than the ingress times , somewhat reminiscent of the transit patterns exhibited by the planets with dust tails : kic 1255b and koi 2700b ( rappaport et al .  2012 ; 2014 ;",

    "( 2015 ) .",
    "we propose a relatively simple strawman model that may explain many of the observed features of the wd 1145 + 017 lightcurve .",
    "the basic idea is that there is a substantive asteroid ( or planetesimal ) , hereafter `` a '' , in an orbit that is stable over intervals of years , if not longer .",
    "the mass of this asteroid , @xmath71 , must lie in the range @xmath72 grams , based on a number of arguments that we present below ( see also vanderburg et al .",
    "we further propose that the asteroid is virtually filling its critical potential surface , and discrete chunks of matter ( hereafter referred to as ` fragments ' ) episodically break off of the asteroid at the l1 point and go into a slightly smaller orbit .",
    "we compute analytically the expected periods of these smaller bodies , and the concomitant drift periods with respect to the `` a '' period , in appendix [ app : drift ] .",
    "we find that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the ratio of asteroid mass to the mass of the white dwarf host star , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the orbital periods of the asteroid and the fragment , respectively .",
    "the l1 point is the natural location from which loose or weakly bound material can break off and fall away from the asteroid .",
    "this , and the l2 point , are the only local saddle points around the critical potential surface , and once an object gets beyond l1 it is free to fall into an independent orbit about the star .",
    "as the smaller released bodies move about the white dwarf they are heated further until there is a freely escaping flow of vapors comprised of the mineral content of the fragment .",
    "this vapor would then condense into dust clouds after escaping the extremely low - gravity environment of the fragment .",
    "radiation pressure from the white dwarf may then push some of the dust into a trailing tail configuration reminiscent of solar system comets ( see rappaport et al .",
    "2014 and vanderburg et al .",
    "2015 for details ) .",
    "such dust tails would explain the longer egress times compared to the ingress times ; this occurs @xmath77 of the time , compared with @xmath78 of the time with longer ingress times than egress times ( for details see sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "we adopt a rough mass - loss rate estimate of @xmath0@xmath79 g s@xmath3 , which is @xmath010 times higher than the estimate provided by vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015 ) due to the higher levels of obscuration at the current epoch than during k2 . with admittedly incomplete information",
    ", we can also estimate that these small released fragments last for only a few weeks before completely disintegrating ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] ) . in that case",
    ", it follows simply from the product of the adopted value of mass - loss rate and an assumed @xmath2 20-day lifetime that their masses should be of order of @xmath80 g , or about the mass of haley s comet ( and a diameter of @xmath06 km ) .",
    "finally , in this regard , we note that with broken off chunks of material this large , the asteroid itself still has sufficient mass to release about @xmath81 of these fragments .",
    "we see about 6 - 10 of these objects in the system at any one time , and if they last for three weeks , that implies an average release rate of about one fragment every few days .",
    "thus , the expected lifetime of the asteroid would be @xmath05,000 years ( at the current activity level ) , or as much as 10 times longer if the k2 level of activity is typical .",
    "we point out that no part of the above scenario precludes the existence of the five other asteroids ( or planetesimals ) which were inferred from the k2 data ( `` b '' through `` f '' ) .",
    "those have periods that range from 1% to 10% _ longer _ than the `` a '' period .",
    "these differences from the `` a '' period ( on the longer side ) are considerably greater than the differences between the `` a '' period and those we infer for the drifting fragments ( on the shorter side ) .",
    "finally , we note that if bodies which cause periodic dips in flux with period @xmath76 ( i.e. , the fragments ) are launched into their orbits at phases synchronized with the transits of the body which launched them ( i.e. , the asteroid , with period @xmath75 ) , then it is an interesting question as to which period ultimately shows up in a periodogram made from the resultant flux data .",
    "we reason that if the fragments last for a duration that is short compared to that of the observations , and there are typically a couple fragments in the system at any one time , then it is @xmath75 which predominantly appears in periodograms .",
    "conversely , if the fragments last for a time comparable to the observations , but there are still only a few in the system at any given time , then it will be @xmath76 , the period of the fragments , that will show up .",
    "if there are too many fragments in the system at any one time , then both signals will tend to be washed out .",
    "this is an interesting mathematical problem to be worked out analytically , but one that is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this work we have identified some 237 significant dips in the intensity of wd 1145 + 017 that are presumably due to obscuration by dust that is local to bodies orbiting around the white dwarf .",
    "the distribution of dip depths is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : depths ] along with a fitting function .",
    "the falloff below 15% in the fitting function , and a shaper cutoff below depths of @xmath06% are undoubtedly due to the limitations of our relatively small aperture telescopes and the lack of s / n for detecting shallow dips .",
    "this was especially true under the unfavorable observing conditions that characterized the 2015 november and early 2015 december observing sessions .",
    "thus , whereas the number of dips we typically found per orbit was 6 to 10 , the actual number that might be observed with a larger aperture telescope is potentially substantially greater .",
    "this remains as a task for future observers ( see also gnsicke et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in spite of the limitations of our telescope apertures",
    ", we were able to track about 15 apparently independent objects orbiting the white dwarf with periods near 4.493 hours ( see also gnsicke et al .",
    "these are best visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] .",
    "the periods of these objects are in the range of 4.4904.495 hours , which are all shorter than the `` a '' period of 4.500 hours by only @xmath00.2% .",
    "nonetheless , all these periods are sufficiently close that we were led to the conclusion that they are all related .",
    "our tentative hypothesis for explaining the relation among these periods is that there is a substantive , long - lived body in the 4.500-hour orbit ( the asteroid ) , which loses fragments of matter that are a tiny fraction of its total mass , and that naturally go into slightly shorter period orbits ( see appendix [ app : drift ] ) .",
    "these smaller fragments last for only a matter of days or weeks before they are destroyed via evaporation and sublimation induced by heating from the central star .",
    "we reasoned that if these fragments first appear as dust emitting objects in phase with the parent asteroid , and last for only a short time , during which they do not drift far in orbital phase from the asteroid , then the period which shows up in periodograms will be the k2 `` a '' period .",
    "if , by contrast , these fragments last for a substantial time ( e.g. , months ) , and there are many of them , then it is likely that only a weak signal , or no signal , will appear in the periodogram at the `` a '' period .",
    "in addition , if there are too many drifting objects then it will be difficult to detect the drift period either because these objects tend to populate all orbital phases and , moreover , there appears to be a dispersion in drift rates . in this work we found a convincing signal at the `` a '' period .",
    "that fact , in addition to a number of the above listed circumstances , can be partially understood by examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] . in the top panel , phased to the `` a '' period",
    ", the preponderance of deep dips do occur between phases @xmath41 .",
    "by contrast , in the bottom panel , phased to the mean of the drift periods , the dips appear too uniformly over all phases to allow that period to show up in periodograms .",
    "the behavior of the drifting fragments seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] raises a number of generally interesting questions in the context of our proposed scenario for the dips : ( i ) do fragments turn on ( i.e. , start to emit enough dust to produce noticeable dips ) immediately after breaking off from the l1 point of the asteroid ?",
    "( ii ) if not , how long can a fragment remain inactive until it turns on ?",
    "( iii ) once a fragment turns on , how long can it remain active ?",
    "of course each fragment will be different , but since we have 15 cases for study it has been possible to place bounds on the answers . in the following we give some illustrative answers .    with respect to the first two questions ,",
    "if a fragment ` turned on ' ( i.e. , started emitting dust ) immediately upon breaking off from the l1 end of the asteroid , it would produce dips starting at the asteroid s phase location .",
    "for example , tracks # 7 , # 8 , # 10 , and # 11 appear to start at phase @xmath82 ( see top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] ) , and persist for about three weeks each . during this time",
    ", the phase drifts to the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] ( top panel ) by @xmath83 .",
    "if these represent fragments that started emitting dust immediately after breaking away from the asteroid , then we would interpret this as pointing to the asteroid being located at phase 0.13 . in this case",
    "tracks # 2 , # 3 , and # 5 , which first appear only at more negative phases , would be inferred to have ` turned on ' only some three weeks after their release , while fragment # 6 would have been delayed by only 6 days before turning on .",
    "fragment # 13 begins at phase + 0.47 , and it has a drift rate of @xmath202.18 min / d , so projecting this line all the way back to a phase of + 0.13 would require @xmath082 days . in other words , this fragment could have remained inactive for over four months from its hypothesized 2015 oct 05 launch from l1 .    in regard to the third question listed above , we note that the longevity of activity can also be estimated from the cases of the 15 drifting fragments .",
    "the median longevity is at least 20 days , and maximum longevity is at least 58 days ( fragments # 1 and # 9 ) .",
    "even these durations may be underestimates , since it appears that a fragment can become too inactive to produce a dip that is detectable using the modest telescopes of this study , and later return to activity ( e.g. , fragments # 5 , 6 , 7 and 12 ) .",
    "this matter remains to be studied by future observations .    finally ,",
    "examination of the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : waterfall ] gives the impression that a number of the drift lines may be diverging from one or more common points several months in the past .",
    "if those projections converge at common times near phase zero ( in the `` a '' frame ) then we could consider this to be evidence that one or more groups of fragments were created on those dates . at the present time",
    ", we do not have the temporal coverage or precision to carry out such projections .",
    "future observations , however , can be viewed with such a model in mind , and may allow one to determine the date of creation of one or more groups of fragments by looking for these points of convergence of the drift lines near phase zero of the main body .    the drifting objects ( the ` fragments ' ) have a notable tendency to show longer egress tails than ingress tails . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau1tau2 ] we show a correlation plot between the fitted time of egress vs.  that for ingress . after eliminating 12 dips with depths of @xmath84",
    ", we find 140 dips with @xmath85 and 61 with @xmath86 ( a 5.5-@xmath39 asymmetry ) .",
    "the longer egress tails , in this picture , would naturally correspond to dust tails that trail the fragment due to radiation pressure ( see , e.g. , rappaport et al .",
    "however , as was shown in sanchis - ojeda et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , dust tails can also _ lead _ the emitting object if the radiation pressure is low enough or if the dust particles have a small scattering cross section ( see , e.g. , kimura et al .",
    "2002 ) . finally , in regard to the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau1tau2 ] , we note that we have not looked carefully into possible correlated errors between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and that further analyses may be required to confirm these apparently significant and suggestive results .",
    "we note that it takes very close to 1 minute for a point - like object to transit across the disk of the white dwarf ( at orbital speeds of 315 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , the ensemble of ingress and egress times implies dust regions that range from the same size as the white dwarf , or smaller , all the way up to dust clouds that are an order of magnitude longer than the white dwarf s diameter .",
    "an important finding of this work , and a prediction of our model , is that the drifting fragments should _ all _ have a period that is shorter than that of the parent body ( the asteroid ) .",
    "the reason follows from the fact that in this scenario the fragments break off from , and leave , the l1 point ( see appendix [ app : drift ] ) .",
    "the question might be raised as to why the fragments always leave from l1 rather than l2 , the two of which are both saddle points in the effective potential at essentially the same potential .",
    "we suggest that the reason is the extreme heating of the tidally locked body ( see vanderburg et al .",
    "2015 ) at the l1 point as opposed to the much lower temperatures that are likely on the dark l2 side of the body",
    ". the higher equilibrium temperatures at l1 would tend to keep the surface material there either molten or at least more ` plastic ' .    of the unexplained observational results for this object enumerated in the introduction",
    ", the numerous transits observed in this work , coupled with the model we have proposed , go a long way toward providing satisfactory answers .",
    "the significantly longer inferred duration of the transits ( i.e. , @xmath050 min ) detected by vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015 ) in k2 data compared with the ground - based data of croll et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and gnsicke et al .",
    "( 2015 ) can now be understood from the fact that the half - hour integration time of k2 is inadequate to track the numerous narrow dips and is mostly responsive to collections of narrow dips that congregate at a particular orbital phase .",
    "the small differences in orbital period between the k2 `` a '' period and the drifting features found from ground - based observations are a consequence of the fact that fragments would naturally tend to fall into shorter - period orbits .",
    "the non - detection of the five weaker periods found by vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015 ) with k2 ( `` b''-``f '' ) during the croll et al .",
    "( 2015 ) observations , as well as in this work , is likely explained by the fact that if those k2 signals continued at the same levels , they would be too weak to be easily detected with ground - based telescopes . finally , our scenario provides a natural explanation for how multiple occulting bodies can coexist in orbits that are very close to 4.5 hours .",
    "in particular , they are hypothesized to originate from a single parent body , and their masses are too low to cause serious dynamical interactions .",
    "one of the difficulties with the proposed model may be the high inferred mass loss rates from such small bodies .",
    "vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that mass loss rates from a ceres - size body ( @xmath01000 km in diameter ) , heated to an equilibrium temperature of @xmath87 k , could be @xmath0@xmath88 g s@xmath3 in the form of vapors of some common minerals .",
    "the fragments from this body , which we take to be of the order of @xmath89 times the mass of ceres , would then be two orders of magnitudes smaller in linear dimensions .",
    "that would indicate that the fragments would have only @xmath0@xmath90 times the surface area of ceres , and therefore we might expect orders of magnitude lower values of mass - loss rate .",
    "one possibility is that the fragments contain a portion of volatiles which act in a more explosive manner when embedded in a low - mass fragment that is suddenly released . of possible relevance to this is the fact that xu et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have found o absorption lines in the circumstellar material near wd 1145 + 017 , that may account for as much as 60% of the mass fraction of the debris . in addition to the presence of oxygen lines in the circumstellar material ,",
    "there is also evidence for hydrogen in the otherwise helium dominated envelope ( xu et al .",
    "2016 ) . while excess o has been interpreted as evidence for water ( e.g. , farihi et al .",
    "2013 ) , xu et al .",
    "( 2016 ) caution that their o abundance is subject to a large uncertainty , and the h abundance is not unusually high for the @xmath7 of this white dwarf ( koester & kepler 2015 ) .",
    "future observations could improve the precision of the o abundance on wd 1145 + 017 because xu et al .",
    "( 2016 ) only detected oxygen lines in moderate resolution spectra .",
    "a positive feature of our model for the drifting features is that the drift periods can be used to infer the mass of the parent asteroid with essentially no free parameters .",
    "the down side of this is that there is no ready explanation for the spread in drift periods by @xmath020% with respect to the `` a '' period .",
    "we should also mention at least one other scenario which might explain some of the same observational facts .",
    "there may be _ no _ ` master body ' in the system from which the dust emitting bodies break off and start an independent existence .",
    "rather , the ` drifting objects ' may be just a collection of debris in a narrow range of orbital periods with @xmath91 whose individual dust emission is erratic , and they can persist in those orbits for years . here",
    "we briefly examine this hypothesis . in terms of orbital stability",
    ", a range in @xmath91 corresponds to a range in orbital radii of @xmath92 .",
    "if we require orbital separations of at least , say , 10 hill s sphere radii for minimal stability over an interval of many years ( especially given that there may be a dozen bodies ) , then we find that the mass of the fragments , @xmath93 , must be : @xmath94 for the case of circular orbits ( eccentric orbits would substantially lower this limiting mass . ) this amounts to a body that is only 1% the mass of ceres .",
    "if these bodies lose mass at an average rate of , say , @xmath88 g s@xmath3 , then they could withstand complete disintegration for @xmath95 years . in this alternative interpretation , there are at least a dozen bodies in long - term stable orbits with periods covering a narrow range of @xmath00.2% whose appearance simply depends on whether they happen to be emitting dust or not .",
    "one argument against this scenario is that during two relatively lengthy observations ( 80 days with k2 and the currently reported observations which span only somewhat less time ) , the only period that shows up in a periodogram to within 1% of the `` a '' period is the `` a '' period itself , and not any of the slightly shorter periods which we identify as drifts .",
    "if all the bodies had an equal status , as independent sources of dust , then this would seem highly unlikely .",
    "in this study we have observed wd 1145 + 017 on 37 nights over a two and a half month interval .",
    "the observations were carried out at a combination of four privately operated amateur observatories equipped with telescopes of aperture 28 cm to 80 cm .",
    "some 237 significant dips in flux were observed during 192 hours of exposure .",
    "the only period that shows up with significance in a bls transform of the data is 4.5004 hours , which is within 3 parts in @xmath28 of the `` a '' period found by vanderburg et al .",
    "( 2015 ) during the k2 observations .",
    "we find some 15 dip features that repeat from one night to the next , and typically last for a few weeks .",
    "the phases of these features drift systematically with respect to this `` a '' period at a rate of @xmath02.5 minutes per day with a dispersion of @xmath00.5 minutes per day .",
    "the periods of the drifting features range from 4.4905 to 4.4951 hours and their mean period is 4.4928 hours .",
    "we propose that the drifting features are caused by dust - emitting fragments that have broken free of a more massive asteroid that orbits with the `` a '' period . the underlying motivation for suggesting",
    "this model is that the most significant period detected during the k2 observations over 80 days was 4.4989 hours which is , to within the mutual uncertainties , a match for the only significant periodicity detected in periodograms of the current observations spanning only a somewhat shorter interval , but 1.5 years later .",
    "it seems a highly likely conclusion that there is a relatively stably orbiting body in the system with this period .",
    "the other drifting periods are the same , to within 0.2% , of the `` a '' period , but seem not to be permanent features of the system .",
    "we therefore are led to believe that the stable feature and the drifting features are physically related .",
    "we show in detail how the orbital period of objects released from the l1 point of an asteroid go into slightly shorter orbital periods by a fractional amount that is proportional to the dimensionless hill s sphere radius . in turn , that radius is proportional to the mass ratio of the parent asteroid to the white dwarf raised to the 1/3 power .",
    "we use this theoretical relation to derive an estimated mass for the parent asteroid of @xmath0@xmath96 g which is about 10% the mass of ceres .    through this work",
    "we have shown that small - to - modest sized telescopes can be extremely effective in following the evolution of the dips in wd 1145 + 017 , both in phase and depth .",
    "while we have learned enough over the course of these 2.5-month - long observations to propose a tentative tidal fragmentation model for the complex array of dips , more monitoring of this object is needed to help confirm or refute the proposed scenario for the drifting features .",
    "moreover , we now know that the overall activity level of this source changes on timescales of months",
    ". it could therefore be quite important to understand the longer timescale variations .",
    "our present observations show considerably increased activity compared to the k2 observations ( vanderburg et al .",
    "2015 ) and the ground - based observations in early 2015 ( vanderburg et al .",
    "2015 ; croll et al .",
    "this nearly 10-fold increase in activity likely occurred sometime between the 2015 march - may observations ( when the activity was still not at the current level ; vanderburg et al .",
    "2015 ; croll et al .",
    "2015 ) and 2015",

    "something must have happened to cause this increased activity . perhaps the `` a''-period asteroid had a collision with another object , such as a large fragment in an orbit whose eccentricity brought them together .",
    "importantly , in spite of the fact that we have assumed that dust is responsible for the dips in this source , there is no _ direct _ evidence currently available to demonstrate either the existence of azimuthally structured dust that can attenuate up to 60% of the system light , or the properties of such dust ( see , e.g. , croll et al .",
    "therefore , we urge observations with larger telescopes covering as wide a wavelength range as possible to determine the wavelength dependence of the dips .    we thank an anonymous referee for some very helpful and insightful comments .",

    "in this appendix we derive the orbits of fragmented bodies that break away from the l1 point of a larger asteroid orbiting a host star near its tidal breakup limit .",
    "in particular , the goal is to establish the rate at which the broken - off bodies will gain in orbital phase with respect to the parent asteroid as a function of time . in this derivation",
    "we utilize roche s ( hill s ) geometry even though when the fragment is still near the asteroid the formalism is not exact ( due to the extended and non - spherical nature of the body )",
    ". however , once the fragment goes into an independent orbit , the approximations should be excellent .",
    "the roche potential expressed in cartesian coordinates about the center of mass of the orbiting asteroid is given by : @xmath97 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath71 are the masses of the host star and asteroid respectively , @xmath99 is the total mass , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the coordinates in the orbital plane , centered on the asteroid , in units of the orbital separation , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the @xmath101 axis lies along the line joining the two bodies .",
    "we will retain all terms of order @xmath105 and @xmath106 , but drop terms of order @xmath74 ( which are @xmath0@xmath81 and @xmath107 times smaller , respectively , than the @xmath105 and @xmath106 terms in this problem ) .",
    "the term with @xmath108 can not be dropped because , even though @xmath74 is of third order , it is divided by terms of the order of @xmath101 and @xmath102 which go as @xmath105 , and therefore the ratio goes like @xmath106 .",
    "this results in : @xmath109\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now expand this expression in a taylor series to second order in @xmath101 and @xmath102 : @xmath110\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting the derivative of @xmath111 equal to zero defines the symmetric lagrange 1 and 2 points along the @xmath101 axis at @xmath112 which is defined as the hill s sphere radius in units of the orbital separation . the shape of the critical potential surface is then given by setting the potential equal to its value at @xmath113 and @xmath114 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 scaled to @xmath118 .",
    "we now wish to examine what orbit is followed by a small chunk of the asteroid ( i.e. , hereafter a `` fragment '' ) which breaks off at the l1 point , begins to fall toward the host star , and is then pushed into orbit via coriolis forces .",
    "we do this by computing the energy and angular momentum in inertial space of a test particle that is released from rest at the l1 point in the rotating frame : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the specific energy in units of @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the specific angular momentum in units of @xmath123 .",
    "the first term in the expression for @xmath122 is the initial angular momentum of the fragment , while the second term is the angular momentum that is lost by the fragment when its orbit is torqued by the asteroid during its escape .",
    "the dependence of the second term on @xmath124 can be shown analytically , but we determined the leading factor of 3 by direct numerical integration .",
    "we show portions of five illustrative tracks for the released fragments in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] .",
    "the different tracks are for five different masses of the asteroid from which the fragment originates ( varying in mass steps by factors of 8) . from this",
    ", one can visualize how both the orbital eccentricity and drift rate of the fragment depend on @xmath128 , and both indeed scale as @xmath105 .",
    "the drift period with which the fragment departs from the asteroid in the rest frame of the asteroid has an analytic solution : @xmath129 if the mean drift rate that we observe is @xmath130 minutes per day , this implies that @xmath131 we can then solve for @xmath74 to find @xmath132 . if we take the white dwarf mass to be @xmath133 then , the mass of the asteroid is @xmath134 g , or about 1/10 times the mass of ceres .",
    "the general results for the mass determination of the asteroid in terms of the drift velocity of the daughter fragments are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "we can also use the above value of @xmath74 to estimate the physical size of the hill s sphere , namely : @xmath135 km . in our scenario , this also provides a first estimate for the size of the asteroid itself ."
