    "the spontaneous emission of charged pairs from the dirac sea under background electromagnetic fields has been an interesting topic of constant research since the seminal works by sauter , heisenberg - euler , and schwinger @xcite .",
    "a strong static electric field can lower the fermi energy of negative energy , charged particles of the dirac sea and open a channel for them to tunnel quantum mechanically into unoccupied , positive energy states and thus create pairs of charged particles as particle - hole pairs .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction of the intense background field with the virtual pairs in the dirac sea makes the vacuum polarized and thereby the maxwell action replaced by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) action @xcite .",
    "the pair production and vacuum polarization is a nonperturbative quantum effect that can not be obtained by summing a finite number of feynmann diagrams , and has attracted attention in various areas , such as qed and black hole physics ( for review and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "the energy consideration puts a constraint on the efficiency of pair - production mechanism in a constant electric field . a pair of mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 can be separated over the compton wavelength @xmath3 and be embodied as a real one before being reannihilated when the electrostatic potential energy between the pair provided is equal to or greater than the rest mass energy @xmath4 . thus the critical strength for pair production is @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath7 for electron - positron pair",
    ". the collision of heavy atoms may form superatoms ( superheavy atoms ) temporarily , whose low energy states can overlap with the fermi energy of the dirac sea , and electron - positron pairs can form and positrons can be emitted , leaving a charged vacuum surrounding the nucleus charge @xcite ( for review and references , see also @xcite ) .",

    "the physical process for charged , astrophysical black holes has been challenged since the huge ratio between the gravitational attraction and the electrostatic repulsion prevents any accretion of charges beyond the critical strength @xcite . still charged black holes have attracted theoretical interest owing to hawking s thermal radiation from black holes , and schwinger mechanism from charged black holes has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the particle emission from charged black holes consists of the thermal radiation and schwinger emission of charged particles of the same kind of charge as the black holes .",
    "extremal and near - extremal charged black holes have the zero and small hawking temperature , so they emit no thermal or exponentially small thermal radiation while the emission is dominated by schwinger mechanism",
    ". schwinger mechanism of near - extremal charged black holes is the same as that of a constant electric field in @xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper",

    "this is a toy model for superatoms and charged black holes in that the size of nuclei and the black hole geometry will not be considered .",
