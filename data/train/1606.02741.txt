    "magnetic fields in large scale astrophysical objects may be generated by a turbulent dynamo , potentially driven by the @xmath1-effect , which arises in this context when differential rotation in the underlying turbulent flow distorts magnetic field lines in such a way that the magnetic field is amplified . however , this effect is subject to quenching , and there is an ongoing investigation in the literature ( see @xcite for a recent review ) examining the question of how random fluctuation of the @xmath1-effect and/or extrinsic random perturbation may overcome this quenching and allow for the spontaneous generation of large - scale magnetic fields . to the best of the author",
    "s knowledge , farrell & ioannou  @xcite were the first to suggest the combined role of operator non - normality and stochastic forcing in the generation of magnetic fields in stellar and galactic objects .",
    "in this article we build upon the analysis of fedotov et al  @xcite , who explored the role played by the interaction of non - normality with stochastic perturbation using a reduced stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath0-dynamo model based on a no-@xmath2 model for spiral galaxies due to moss  @xcite .",
    "this model assumes a thin rotating turbulent disk of a conducting medium of uniform thickness , where the angular velocity varies by distance from the centre .",
    "the sensitivity of the reduced dynamo model to perturbation is illustrated as a consequence of the non - normality of the unperturbed system .",
    "a normal matrix is one that is diagonalisable by a unitary transform .",
    "solutions of a system of first - order ordinary differential equations governed by a non - normal coefficient matrix undergo transients that are potentially large in extent and duration , even though the spectral abscissa of the coefficient may be negative .",
    "these transients are amplified by perturbation , and consequently the stability of an equilibrium solution may be vulnerable either to stochastic perturbation , or perturbation by higher - order terms omitted in the process of linearisation , even if the intensity is small .",
    "the same phenomenon is discussed in the context of test system selection for numerical methods of sdes in @xcite , and some further applied examples are treated in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the instability and stability in probability of the equilibrium solution that corresponds to a magnetic field that has undergone catastrophic quenching .",
    "the goal of the article is to determine the role of multiplicative stochastic perturbation arising from random fluctuation in the @xmath1-effect in the absence of additive noise . to that end",
    "we derive a formula for the upper lyapunov exponent of the linearised system in terms of the model parameters and observe how the sign responds to changes in the non - normality of the drift and the intensity of the perturbation .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use the linearisation of their model to show that the interaction of the multiplicative stochastic term ( random fluctuation in the @xmath1-effect ) with the non - normality of the unperturbed system leads to a loss of mean - square asymptotic stability in the subcritical case , interpreted as the generation of a sustained magnetic field . a preliminary numerical investigation of trajectories of the nonlinear model yielded observations of a stochastically induced phase transition in the presence of additive noise .",
    "in @xcite the authors continued their theoretical investigation , using adiabatic elimination to derive a stochastic differential equation that governs the behaviour of the slow variable of the nonlinear system close to the transition .",
    "the probability density function of this governing sde underwent qualitative changes in response to an increase in intensity of the multiplicative noise term .    to see why we work with lyapunov exponents ,",
    "consider that the work in @xcite addresses the exponential mean - square stability of the linearised equation in the drift - subcritical regime , and the behaviour of the distribution of the slowly varying component of the nonlinear system .",
    "exponential mean - square stability is sufficient but not necessary for stability in probability of the equilibrium of the nonlinear stochastic system .",
    "indeed , there is currently no theoretical link whatsoever between linear mean - square instability and nonlinear instability . in order to draw conclusions about the development of instability of any kind in the nonlinear model via the linearisation an understanding of pathwise behaviour beyond that provided by numerical simulation is necessary and one must compute upper lyapunov exponents .",
    "such an analysis of the stability of the nonlinear stochastic model has never been carried out and we do so here , comparing regions of stability provided by the upper lyapunov exponent to those provided by exponential mean - square stability in in @xcite , and to regions of sub / super - criticality in the unperturbed model .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ background ]",
    "we provide the model equations and the appropriate definitions and results from the theory of stochastic stability .",
    "we select and describe a suitable measure of non - normality for the linearised model system , present a sharp condition for its exponential mean - square stability , and outline the theory of lyapunov exponents for linear stochastic systems . in section [ asasy ]",
    "we use the methods of imkeller & lederer  @xcite , which build upon the work of arnold et al  @xcite , to derive a formula for the upper lyapunov exponent @xmath3 of the linearised model , expressed in terms of gamma and generalised hypergeometric functions . in section [ visualisation ]",
    "we use the results presented in sections [ background ] and [ asasy ] to plot regions of exponential mean - square stability along with regions of positive and negative @xmath3 : demonstrating the influence of perturbation of the @xmath1-effect , showing how these regions change with the non - normality of the drift , and identifying regions of the parameter space where the equilibrium of the nonlinear model system is stable or unstable in probability .",
    "we select the following reduced 2-dimensional stochastic model of an @xmath0-dynamo , which was used by fedotov et al  @xcite to investigate the role of stochastic perturbation in the generation of large - scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies .",
    "the radial ( @xmath4 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath5 ) components of the magnetic field @xmath6 are governed by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a wiener process and the drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11 here , @xmath12 are dimensionless parameters with typical values @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] , and @xmath15 .",

    "terms parameterised by @xmath1 correspond to the contribution of the @xmath1-effect on the field , and those parameterised by @xmath18 refer to the contribution of turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the relationship between the reduced model and the full model is described and motivated in @xcite .",
    "note that we omit additive noise from the model in order to focus on the influence of perturbations arising from stochastic fluctuation in the @xmath1-effect .",
