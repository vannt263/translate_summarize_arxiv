    "we take the band gap @xmath14 .",
    "it may take on a constant value on the loop , or have some @xmath15 dependence .",
    "a plot of the dispersion is shown in fig . [ loopfig ] .        the topological properties of this model can be characterized by the chern number , @xmath16 , of the occupied band , which is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the berry curvature and @xmath19 is the berry connection@xcite , @xmath20 is a bloch eigenstate of the occupied band , and the integral is over the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "equation ( [ vk ] ) yields a well defined result provided that the loop is gapped .",
