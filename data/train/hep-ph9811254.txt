    "in the standard model ( sm ) the cancellation of the chiral anomalies takes place only when we consider the contributions of leptons and quarks , indicating a deeper relation between them .",
    "therefore , it is rather natural to consider extensions of the sm that treat quarks and leptons in the same footing and consequently introduce new bosons , called leptoquarks , that mediate quark - lepton transitions .",
    "the class of theories exhibiting these particles includes composite models @xcite , grand unified theories @xcite , technicolor models @xcite , and superstring - inspired models @xcite . since leptoquarks couple to a lepton and a quark , they are color triplets under @xmath1 , carry simultaneously lepton and baryon number , have fractional electric charge , and can be of scalar or vector nature .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", leptoquarks possess the striking signature of a peak in the invariant mass of a charged lepton with a jet , which make their search much simpler without the need of intricate analyses of several final state topologies .",
    "certainly , the experimental observation of leptoquarks is an undeniable signal of physics beyond the sm , so there have been a large number of direct searches for them in @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , and @xmath3 @xcite colliders .",
    "up to now all of these searches led to negative results , which bound the mass of vector leptoquarks to be larger than 245340 ( 230325 ) gev , depending on the leptoquark coupling to gluons , for branching ratio into @xmath4-jet equal to 1 ( 0.5 ) @xcite .    the direct search for leptoquarks with masses above a few hundred gev",

    "we extend our previous analyses of the lhc potentiality to discover scalar leptoquarks to vector ones @xcite .",
    "we study the pair production of first generation leptoquarks that lead to a final state topology containing two jets plus a pair @xmath0 .",
    "we analyze this signal for vector leptoquarks and use the results for the sm backgrounds obtained in ref.@xcite , where careful studies of all possible top production , qcd and electroweak backgrounds for this topology were performed using the event generator pythia @xcite .",

    "while we were preparing this paper , a similar study of the production of vector leptoquarks appeared @xcite , which uses a different event generator , distinct cuts and a less general leptoquark coupling to gluons , which contains only the chromomagnetic anomalous coupling to gluons .",

    "we assume here that these quantities are independent in order to work with the most general scenario .",

    "the field strength tensors of the gluon and vector leptoquark fields are respectively @xmath50 with the covariant derivative given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the gluon field .    at present",
    "there are no direct bounds on the anomalous parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",

    "although the processes for the production of scalar leptoquarks are incorporated in pythia , the vector leptoquark production is absent . in order to study the pair production of vector leptoquarks via the processes ( [ eq : qq ] ) and ( [ eq : gg ] ) we have created a monte carlo generator for these reactions , adding a new external user processes to the pythia  5.7/jetset  7.4 package @xcite .",
    "we have included in our simulation two cases of anomalous vector leptoquark couplings to gluons , as well as their decays into fermions .    in our analyses",
    ", we assume that the pair production of leptoquarks is due entirely to strong interactions , i.e. , we neglect the contributions from @xmath54-channel lepton exchange via the leptoquark couplings to fermions @xcite . this hypothesis is reasonable since the fermionic couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 are bounded to be rather small by the low energy experiments for leptoquarks masses of the order of tev s .",

    "quark fusion is less important in the minimal coupling scenario .",
    "pairs of leptoquarks decaying into @xmath4 and a @xmath58 or @xmath59 quark produce a pair @xmath60 and two jets as signature . in our analyses",
    "we kept track of the @xmath4 ( jet ) carrying the largest transverse momentum , that we denoted by @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , and the @xmath4 ( jet ) with the second largest @xmath63 , that we called @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "furthermore , we mimicked the experimental resolution of the hadronic calorimeter by smearing the final state quark energies according to @xmath66 the reconstruction of jets was done using the subroutine lucell of pythia . the minimum @xmath67 threshold for a cell to be considered as",
    "a jet initiator has been chosen 2 gev , while we assumed the minimum summed @xmath67 for a collection of cells to be accepted as a jet to be 7 gev inside a cone @xmath68 .",
    "the calorimeter was divided on @xmath69 cells in @xmath70 with these variables in the range @xmath71 .",
    "within the scope of the sm , there are many sources of backgrounds leading to jets accompanied by a @xmath0 pair , which we classify into three classes @xcite : qcd processes , electroweak interactions , and top quark production .",
    "the reactions included in the qcd class depend exclusively on the strong interaction and the main source of hard @xmath4 in this case is the semileptonic decay of hadrons possessing quarks @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "the electroweak processes contains the drell  yan production of quark pairs and the single and pair productions of electroweak gauge bosons . due to the large gluon - gluon luminosity at the lhc ,",
    "the production of top quark pairs is important by itself due to its large cross section .",
    "these backgrounds have been fully analyzed by us in ref .",
    "@xcite and we direct the reader to this reference for further information .    in order to enhance the signal and reduce the sm backgrounds we have devised a number of kinematical cuts in ref .  @xcite that we briefly present :    * we require that the leading jets and @xmath4 are in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath74 ; * the leading leptons ( @xmath61 and @xmath64 ) should have @xmath75 gev ; * we reject events where the invariant mass of the pair @xmath0 ( @xmath76 ) is smaller than 190 gev .",
    "this cut reduces the backgrounds coming from @xmath16 decays into a pair @xmath60 ; * in order to further reduce the @xmath77 and remaining off - shell @xmath16 backgrounds , we required that _ all _ the invariant masses @xmath78 are larger than 200 gev , since pairs @xmath79 coming from an on - shell top decay have invariant masses smaller than @xmath80 .",
    "the present experiments are able to search for leptoquarks with masses smaller than 200 gev , therefore , this cut does not introduce any bias on the leptoquark search .",
    "the above cuts reduce to a negligible level all the sm backgrounds @xcite . in principle",
    "we could also require the @xmath4 to be isolated from hadronic activity in order to reduce the qcd backgrounds .",
    "nevertheless , we verified that our results do not change when we introduce typical isolation cuts in addition to any of the above cuts .",
    "since the leptoquark searches at the lhc are free of backgrounds after these cuts @xcite , the lhc will be able to exclude with 95% c.l .",
    "the regions of parameter space where the number of expected signal events is larger than 3 for a given integrated luminosity .",
    "in order to access the effect of the cuts c1c4 we exhibit in fig .   [ fig1 ] the @xmath63 distribution of the two most energetic leptons and jets originating from the decay of a vector leptoquark of 1 tev for minimal cross section and yang  mills couplings to gluons .",
    "as we can see from this figure , the @xmath63 distribution are peaked at @xmath81 (=  500 gev ) , and also exhibit a large fraction of very hard jets and leptons .",
    "the presence of this peak indicates that the two hardest jets and leptons usually originate from the decay of the leptoquark pair .",
    "however , we still have to determine which are the lepton and jet coming from the decay of one of the leptoquarks .",
    "moreover , we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a the @xmath60 invariant mass distribution associated to 1 tev vector leptoquark events .",
    "clearly the bulk of the @xmath0 pairs are produced at high invariant masses , and consequently the impact of the cut c3 on the signal is small .",
    "[ fig2]b shows the invariant mass distribution for the four possible @xmath79 pairs combined in the 1 tev vector leptoquark case ; the cut c4 does not affect significantly the signal either .",
    "in our analyses of vector leptoquark pair production we applied the cuts c1c4 and also required the events to have two @xmath4-jet pairs with invariant masses in the range @xmath82 with @xmath83 given in table [ bins ] .",
    "the pair production cross section after cuts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] for minimal cross section and yang  mills couplings .",
    "for fixed values of @xmath49 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the attainable bounds at the lhc on vector leptoquarks depend upon its branching ratio ( @xmath84 ) into a charged lepton and a jet , which is 0.5 or 1 for the leptoquarks listed on table [ t : cor ] .",
    "we exhibit in table [ t : lim : pair ] the 95% c.l .",
    "limits on the leptoquark masses that can be obtained from their pair production at the lhc for two different integrated luminosities . in the worse scenario , _",

    "this bound increases to 1.8 ( 1.9 ) tev .",
    "moreover , the limits are 300 gev more stringent in the case of yang  mills coupling to gluons . at this point",
