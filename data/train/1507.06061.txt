    "in 1967 winfree @xcite proposed a model describing the synchronization of a population of organisms or _",

    "we call natural frequency , the frequency of each oscillator , as if it were isolated from the others .",
    "the natural frequencies are localized inside an interval @xmath5 $ ] for some constant @xmath2 that we call _ spectrum width_. the interaction of the surrounding oscillators on a particular oscillator has a shape independent of this oscillator .",
    "the term _ mean field _ is used for this kind of interaction or coupling .",
    "we assume that the coupling is measured by a single parameter @xmath1 called _ coupling strength_.    a numerical investigation and a mathematical analysis of the transitions between the phases show a diagram of 4 major states ( see ariaratnam and strogatz @xcite ) . a phase called _ the death state _ where each oscillator is at rest , a phase called _ the locking state _ where all the oscillators possess the same non - zero frequency , a phase called _ the incoherence state _ where the frequency of each oscillator is increasing with respect to the natural frequency , and a phase called _ the partial death state _ which is a mixed state where a part of the oscillators are in death state and a part is in incoherence state . for small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the winfree model is reduced to a different model , the kuramoto model that will not be studied in this article .",
    "our result for @xmath6 is weaker than the results obtained in the articles @xcite , nevertheless we identify a new hypothesis for the existence of synchronization which is valid for all regimes .",
    "we show in addition in a numerical example that the existence of synchronization disappears precisely when the hypothesis is not anymore realized .",
    "the winfree model is given by the following differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 @xmath11-periodic functions , @xmath12 is the phase of the i - th oscillator , and @xmath13 is the global state of the system .",
    "although @xmath12 represents a scalar in the torus @xmath14 , we actually consider its unique continuous lift in @xmath15 , that we continue to call it @xmath12 .",

    "it is important to notice that we do not make any assumptions on the number @xmath0 of oscillators ; in particular we do not assume that @xmath31 .",
    "we do not assume either that the natural frequencies are distributed according to a particular law as it is done in @xcite .",
    "our main objective is to exhibit a domain in the parameter space @xmath4 independent of @xmath0 and any choice of the natural frequencies satisfying h2 such that the oscillators stay synchronized for all time and for any initial conditions sufficiently packed .",
    "synchronization and locking may have several meanings or definitions depending on the authors .",
    "we choose the following definitions .",
    "we say that the oscillators @xmath12 are synchronized if @xmath32    [ definition : periodiclocking ] we say that the oscillators @xmath12 are periodically locked to the frequency @xmath33 if they are synchronized and if there exist @xmath34-periodic functions @xmath35 such that @xmath36    we notice that in the periodic locking case the average frequency @xmath37 admits the limit @xmath33 as @xmath38 and that this limit is independent of the ith oscillator .",
    "the fact that the limit does exist has never been addressed mathematically ( except of course in the death state ) .",
    "our main result is a partial result in that direction in the locking case when @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "moreover our proof is valid for the two regimes : for a small coupling strength @xmath41 between the oscillators , and for a strong coupling strength close to the death state @xmath42 .",
