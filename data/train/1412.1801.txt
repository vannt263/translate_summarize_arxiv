    "it is well known that gauge theories play presently a basic role in describing all the known interactions . in all cases ,",
    "gauge symmetries are related to physical fields directly arising from the symmetries ruling some given interaction ; on one side , this leads to the rising of a new , dynamical gauge field ; on the other hand , if the gauge symmetry is broken , such a circumstance provides one with new  often unforeseen  informations about the structural properties of the interaction considered .    often , as known as well , in spite of the fact that the physical world is the usual minkowski space - time , the gauge manifold is _ not _ the usual , minkowski one .",
    "for instance , in the case of the usual minkowski space , the gauge symmetry of electrodynamics does actually work in an auxiliary space ( weyl charge space ) .",
    "it is therefore worth to investigate when and where gauge symmetries can be introduced in a minkowski space , and to lead to significant physical results .",
    "it is just the purpose of the present paper to show that  this circumstance occurs in the framework of _ deformed special relativity ( dsr ) , _ namely a ( four - dimensional ) generalization of the ( local ) space - time structure based on an energy - dependent deformation  of the usual minkowski geometry carmig1,carmig2 . as we shall see , in dsr two kinds of gauge symmetries arise , whose spaces either coincide with the deformed minkowski space ( dms ) @xmath0 or are just internal spaces to it .",
    "this is why we named them _",
    "`` metric gauge theories '' .",
    "_    the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we review the basic features of dsr that are relevant to our purposes . sect.3",
    "discuss dsr as a metric gauge theory .",
    "metric gauge fields can be external ( subsect.3.1 ) or internal ( subsect.3.2 ) .",
    "the last topic is related to the structure of dms as generalized lagrange space , whose main properties are summarized .",
    "3.2.2 deals with the structure of @xmath1 as generalized lagrange space .",
    "the internal gauge fields of @xmath1 are discussed in subsect.3.2.4 . in 3.3",
    "we present a possible experimental evidence for such metric gauge fields .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are given in sect.4 .",
    "the geometrical structure of the physical world  both at a large and a small scale   has been debated since a long .",
    "after einstein , the generally accepted view considers the arena of physical phenomena as a four - dimensional spacetime , endowed with a _",
    "global , _ curved , riemannian structure and a _ local , _ flat , minkowskian geometry .",
    "however , an analysis of some experimental data concerning physical phenomena ruled by different fundamental interactions have provided evidence for a local departure from minkowski metric @xcite : among them , the lifetime of the ( weakly decaying ) _ k@xmath2 _",
    "meson , the bose - einstein correlation in ( strong ) pion production and the superluminal propagation of electromagnetic waves in waveguides .",
    "these phenomena seemingly show a ( local ) breakdown of lorentz invariance , together with a plausible inadequacy of the minkowski metric ; on the other hand , they can be interpreted in terms of a deformed minkowski spacetime , with metric____coefficients depending on the energy of the process considered carmig1,carmig2 .",
    "all the above facts suggested to introduce a ( four - dimensional ) generalization of the ( local ) space - time structure based on an energy - dependent deformation  of the usual minkowski geometry of @xmath3 , whereby the corresponding deformed metrics ensuing from the fit to the experimental data seem to provide an _ effective dynamical description of the relevant interactions  _ ( _ at the energy scale and in the energy range considered _ ) .",
    "an analogous energy - dependent metric seems to hold for the gravitational field ( at least locally , i.e. in a neighborhood of earth ) when analyzing some classical experimental data concerning the slowing down of clocks .",
    "let us shortly review the main ideas and results concerning the ( four - dimensional ) deformed minkowski spacetime @xmath1 .",
    "the four - dimensional deformed  metric scheme is based on the assumption that spacetime , in a preferred frame which is _ fixed _ by the scale of energy @xmath4 , is endowed with a metric of the form    @xmath5    with @xmath6 @xmath7 being the usual speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we named deformed special relativity  ( dsr ) the relativity theory built up on metric ( 1 ) .",
    "metric ( 1 ) is supposed to hold locally , i.e. in the spacetime region where the process occurs .",
    "it is supposed moreover to play a _",
    "dynamical _ role , and to provide a geometric description of the interaction considered . in this sense , dsr realizes the so called _ `` finzi principle of solidarity '' _ between space - time and phenomena occurring in it _ _  _ _ [ multiblock footnote omitted](see @xcite ) .",
    "futhermore , we stress that , from the physical point of view , @xmath4 _ _  is the measured energy of the system _ _ , and thus a merely phenomenological ( non - metric ) variable .",
    "so , @xmath4 is the energy of the system measured in _ fully minkowskian conditions . _ ] .",
    "we notice explicitly that the spacetime @xmath1 described by ( 1 ) is flat ( it has zero four - dimensional curvature ) , so that the geometrical description of the fundamental interactions based on it differs from the general relativistic one ( whence the name deformation  used to characterize such a situation ) .",
    "although for each interaction the corresponding metric reduces to the minkowskian one for a suitable value of the energy @xmath8 ( which is characteristic of the interaction considered ) , the energy of the process is fixed and can not be changed at will .",
    "thus , in spite of the fact that _ formally _ it would be possible to recover  the usual minkowski space @xmath3 by a suitable change of coordinates ( e.g. by a rescaling ) , this would amount , in such a framework , to be a mere mathematical operation devoid of any physical meaning .    as far as phenomenology is concerned , it is important to recall that a local breakdown of lorentz invariance may be envisaged for all the four fundamental interactions ( electromagnetic , weak , strong and gravitational ) whereby _",
    "_  one gets evidence for a departure of the spacetime metric from the minkowskian one _ _ ( in the energy range examined )",
    ". the explicit functional form of the metric ( 1 ) for all the four interactions can be found in @xcite . here ,",
    "we confine ourselves to recall the following basic features of these energy - dependent phenomenological metrics :    \\1 ) both the electromagnetic and the weak metric show the same functional behavior , namely@xmath9@xmath10with the only difference between them being the threshold energy @xmath8 , i.e. the energy value at which the metric parameters are constant , i.e. the metric becomes minkowskian ; the fits to the experimental data yield @xmath11    \\2 ) for strong and gravitational interactions , the metrics read : @xmath12@xmath13    @xmath14    with @xmath15let us stress that , in this case , contrarily to the electromagnetic and the weak ones , _ a deformation of the time coordinate occurs ; _ moreover , _ the three - space is anisotropic _ , with two spatial parameters constant ( but different in value ) and the third one variable with energy in an _ over - minkowskian _ way ( namely it reaches the limit of minkowskian metric for decreasing values of @xmath4 , with @xmath16 ) carmig1,carmig2 .    as a final remark",
    ", we stress that actually _ _ the four - dimensional energy - dependent spacetime  _ _ @xmath1 _ is just a manifestation of a larger , five - dimensional space in which energy plays the role of a fifth dimension .",
    "_ indeed , it can be shown that the physics of the interaction lies in the curvature of such a five - dimensional spacetime , in which the four - dimensional , deformed minkowski space is embedded .",
    "moreover , _ all _ the phenomenological metrics ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) can be obtained as solutions of the vacuum einstein equations in this generalized kaluza - klein scheme @xcite .",
    "we want now to show that the deformation of space - time , expressed by the metric @xmath17 ( eq.(1 ) ) , does affect also the external fields applied to the physical system considered .",
    "let us consider for instance the case of a physical process ruled by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "therefore , the minkowski space @xmath3 is endowed with the electromagnetic tensor @xmath18 ( external e.m . field ) acting on the system .",
    "of course @xmath19 .    in the deformed minkowski space @xmath1",
    ", the covariant components of the electromagnetic tensor read @xmath20where @xmath21we have therefore @xmath22or @xmath23(no sum on repeated indices ! ) .",
    "it follows that the tensor @xmath24 is not antisymmetric : @xmath25    the result shown here for the electromagnetic interaction can be generalized to other fundamental interactions described by tensor fields .    on account of the well - known identification @xmath26(and analogously for @xmath27 ) , we can write , for the energy density @xmath28 of the deformed electromagnetic field : @xmath29to be compared with the standard expression for the e.m .",
    ", @xmath31 : @xmath32    _ there is therefore a difference in the energy associated to the electromagnetic field in the deformed space - time region .",
    "_ we have , for the energy density @xmath33we can state that the difference @xmath34 represents _ the energy spent by the interaction in order to deform the space - time geometry .",
    "_    we can therefore conclude that _ the deformation of space - time does affect the field itself that deforms the geometry of the space_. there is therefore a feedback between space and interaction which fully implements the solidarity principle .",
    "it is clear from the discussion of the phenomenological metrics describing the four fundamental interactions in dsr that the minkowski space @xmath3 is the space - time manifold of background of any experimental measurement and detection ( namely , of any process of acquisition of information on physical reality ) . in particular",
    ", we can consider this minkowski space as that associated to the electromagnetic interaction above the threshold energy @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , in modeling the physical phenomena , one has to take into account this fact .",
    "the geometrical nature of interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ assuming the validity of the finzi principle , means that one has to suitably _ gauge _ ( with reference to @xmath3 ) the space - time metrics with respect to the interaction   and/or the phenomenon  under study .",
    "in other words , one needs to adjust  suitably the local metric of space - time according to the interaction acting in the region considered .",
    "we can name such a procedure _ metric gaugement process _ ( m.g.p . ) .",
    "like in usual gauge theories a different phase is chosen in different space - time _",
    "points _ , in dsr different metrics are associated to different space - time _",
    "manifolds _ according to the interaction acting therein .",
    "we have thus a gauge structure on the space of manifolds @xmath36where @xmath37 is the set of the energy - dependent pseudoeuclidean metrics of the type ( 1 ) .",
    "this is why it is possible to regard deformed special relativity as a _",
    "metric gauge theory_. in this case , we can consider the related fields as _ external metric gauge fields .",
    "_    however , let us notice that dsr can be considered as a metric gauge theory from another point of view , on account of the dependence of the metric coefficients on the energy .",
    "actually , once the mgp has been applied , by selecting the suitable gauge ( namely , the suitable _ functional form _ of the metric ) according to the interaction considered ( thus implementing the finzi principle ) , the metric dependence on the energy implies another different gauge process .",
    "namely , the metric is gauged according to the process under study , thus selecting the _ given _ metric , with the__given _ _ _ values _ of the coefficients , suitable for the given phenomenon .",
    "we have therefore a _",
    "double _ metric gaugement , according , on one side , to the interaction ruling the physical phenomenon examined , and on the other side to its energy , in which the metric coefficients are the analogous of the gauge functions ( with energy as extra dimension ) embedding @xmath1 , on which deformed relativity in five dimensions ( dr5 ) is based ( see @xcite ) . in @xmath38 , in fact , energy is no longer a parametric variable , like in dsr , but plays the role of fifth ( metric ) coordinate .",
    "the invariance under such a metric gauge , not manifest in four dimensions , is instead recovered in the form of the isometries of the five - dimensional space - time - energy manifold @xmath38 . ] .",
    "we want now to show that the deformed minkowski space @xmath1 of deformed special relativity does possess another well - defined geometrical structure , besides the deformed metrical one .",
    "precisely , we will show that @xmath0  is a _",

    "it contained two infrared leds s@xmath208 and s@xmath209 , three detectors a , b and c ( either photodiodes or phototransistors ) and three apertures f@xmath208 , f@xmath209 and f@xmath210 .",
    "the source s@xmath208 was aligned with the detector a through the aperture f@xmath208 , the source s@xmath209 was aligned with the detector c which was right on the aperture f@xmath210 .",
    "the detector b was in front of the aperture f@xmath209 and did not receive any photon directly .",
    "the position of the detectors , the sources and the apertures was designed so that the detector a was not influenced by the lighting state of the source s@xmath209 according to the laws of physics governing photons propagation . in other words ,",
    "a did not have to distinguish whether s@xmath209 was on or off .",
    "besides , in order to prevent reflections of photons , the internal surfaces of the box had been coated by an absorbing material . while the detectors b and c",
    "were controlling detectors , a was devoted to perform the actual experiment .",
    "in particular , we compared the signal , measured on a when s@xmath208 was on and s@xmath209 was off , with the signal on a when both sources s@xmath208 and s@xmath209 were on .",
    "as to what it has been said about the incapability of a to distinguish between s@xmath209 off or on , these two compared conditions were expected to produce compatible results .",
    "however , it turned out that the sampling of the signal on a with s@xmath211 on and s@xmath209 on and the sampling of the signal on a when only s@xmath208 was on do not belong to the same population and are represented by two different gaussian distributions whose mean values are significantly different .",
    "besides , the difference between the two mean values was less than 4.5 @xmath212 , as predicted by the theory of deformed space - time carmig1,carmig2 .",
    "since it was experimentally verified that no photons passed through the aperture f@xmath209 , this result shows an anomalous behaviour of the photon system .",
    "the same experiment was carried out by different sources , detectors , by two different boxes and different measuring systems . nevertheless , every time we obtained the same anomalous result shad2,shad3,shad4 . moreover , the same kind of geometrical structure and the same spatial distances were used in other kind of experiments carried out in the microwave region of the spectrum and by a laser system ranf1,ranf2,carmig1,carmig2 . although these experiments had completely different experimental set - ups from our initial one , they succeeded in finding out the same kind of anomalous behaviour that we had found out by the box experiments .",
    "the anomalous effect in photon systems , at least in those experimental set - ups that were used , disagrees both with standard quantum mechanics ( copenhagen interpretation ) and with classical and quantum electrodynamics .",
    "some possible interpretations can be given in terms of either the existence of de broglie  bohm pilot waves associated to photons , and/or the breakdown of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) @xcite .",
    "besides , it turns out that it is also possible to move a step forward and hypothesise the existence of an intriguing connection between the pilot wave interpretation and that involving lli breakdown .",
    "one might assume that the pilot wave is , in the framework of lli breakdown , a local deformation of the flat minkowskian spacetime .",
    "the interpretation in terms of dsr is quite straightforward . under the energy threshold @xmath213=4.5",
    "@xmath212 , the metric of the electromagnetic interaction is no longer minkowskian .",
    "the corresponding space - time is deformed .",
    "such a space - time deformation shows up as the hollow wave accompanying the photon , and is able to affect the motion of other photons .",
    "this is the origin of the anomalous interference observed ( _ shadow of light _ ) .",
    "the difference of signal measured by the detector a in all the double - slit experiments can be regarded as the energy spent to deforme space - time . in space regions where the external electromagnetic field is present ( regions of `` standard '' photon behavior ) , we can associate such energy to the difference @xmath34 , eq.(16 ) , between the energy density corresponding to the external e.m . field @xmath27 and that of the deformed one @xmath24 given by eq.(8 ) .",
    "but it is known from the experimental results that the anomalous interference effects observed can be explained in terms of the shadow of light , namely in terms of the hollow waves present in space regions where no external e.m .",
    "field occurs . how to account for this anomalous photon behavior within dsr ?",
    "the answer is provided by the internal structure of the deformed minkowski space discussed above .",
    "in fact , we have seen that the structure of the deformed minkowski space @xmath1 as generalized lagrange space implies the presence of two internal e.m .",
    "fields , the horizontal field @xmath195 and the vertical one , @xmath214 .",
    "whereas @xmath195 is strictly related to the presence of the external electromagnetic field @xmath27 , vanishing if @xmath215 , _ _",
    "_ _ the vertical field @xmath201  is geometrical in nature , depending only on the deformed metric tensor @xmath216  of @xmath217  and on @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , it is present also in space - time regions where no external electromagnetic field occurs . in our opinion ,",
    "the arising of the internal electromagnetic fields associated to the deformed metric of @xmath1 as generalized lagrange space is at the very physical , _ dynamic _ interpretation _ _  _ _ of the experimental results on the anomalous photon behavior .",
    "namely , _ the dynamic effects of the hollow wave of the photon , associated to the deformation of space - time _  which manifest themselves in the photon behavior contradicting both classical and quantum electrodynamics  _ , arise from the presence of the internal v - electromagnetic field _ @xmath201 ( in turn strictly connected to the geometrical structure of @xmath1 ) .    moreover , as is well known , in relativistic theories , the vacuum is nothing but minkowski geometry .",
    "a lli breaking connected to a deformation of the minkowski space is therefore associated to a lack of lorentz invariance of the vacuum .",
    "then , the view by kostelecky @xcite that the breakdown of lli is related to the lack of lorentz symmetry of the vacuum accords with our results in the framework of dsr , provided that the quantum vacuum is replaced by the geometric vacuum .",
    "as is well known , successfully embodying gauge fields in a space - time structure is one of the basic goals of the research in theoretical physics starting from the beginning of the xx century .",
    "the almost unique tool to achieve such objective is increasing the number of space - time dimensions .",
    "in such a kind of theories ( whose prototype is the celebrated kaluza - klein formalism ) , one preserves the usual ( special - relativistic or general - relativistic ) structure of the four - dimensional space - time , and gets rid of the non - observable extra dimensions by compactifying them ( for example to circles ) .",
    "then the motions of the extra metric components over the standard minkowski space satisfy identical equations to gauge fields .",
    "the gauge invariance of these fields is simply a consequence of the lorentz invariance in the enlarged space . in this framework ,",
    "gauge fields are _ external _ to the space - time , because they are _ added _ to it by the hypothesis of extra dimensions .    in the case of the dsr theory ,",
    "gauge fields arise from the very geometrical , basic structure of @xmath1 , namely they are a consequence of the metric deformation .",
    "the arising gauge fields are _ intrinsic and internal to the deformed space - time _ , _  and do not need to be added from the outside .",
    "_ as a matter of fact , _ dsr is the first theory based on a four - dimensional space - time able to embody gauge fields in a natural way . _",
    "such a conventional , intrinsic gauge structure is related to a _ given _ deformed minkowski space @xmath218 , in which the deformed metric is fixed : @xmath219on the contrary , with varying @xmath17 , we have another gauge - like structure  as already stressed in sect.3  namely what we called an external metric gauge . in the latter case",
    ", the gauge freedom amounts to choosing the metric according to the interaction considered .",
    "the circumstance that the deformed minkowski space @xmath1 is endowed with the geometry of a generalized lagrange space testifies the richness of non - trivial mathematical properties present in the seemingly so simple structure of the deformation of the minkowski metric . in this connection ,",
    "let us recall that @xmath1 ( contrarily to the usual minkowski space ) is not flat , but does possess curvature and torsion ( see 3.2.1 ) .",
    "let us stress that  as already mentioned  the deformed minkowski space @xmath1 can be naturally embedded in a five - dimensional riemannian space @xmath220 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we denoted by dr5 the generalized theory based on this five - dimensional space .    in embedding the deformed minkowski space @xmath1 in @xmath221 ,",
    "_ energy does lose its character of dynamic parameter _ ( the role it plays in dsr ) , _ by taking instead that of a true metrical coordinate , _",
    "@xmath222 , on the same footing of the space - time ones .",
    "this has a number of basic implications .",
    "in such a change of role of energy , with the consequent passage from @xmath1 to @xmath220 , some of the geometrical and dynamic features of dsr are lost , whereas others are still present and new properties appear .",
    "the first one is of geometrical nature , and is just the passage from a ( flat ) pseudoeuclidean metric to a genuine ( curved ) riemannian one .",
    "the other consequences pertain to both symmetries and dynamics . among the former , we recall the basic one",
    " valid at the slicing level @xmath223 ( @xmath224 )  , related to the generalized lagrange space structure of @xmath1 , which implies _ the natural arising of gauge fields _ , intimately related to the inner geometry of the deformed minkowski space .",
    "let us also stress that , in the framework of @xmath225 , the dependence of the metric coefficients on a true metric coordinate make them fully analogous to the gauge functions of non - abelian gauge theories , thus implementing dr5 as a metric gauge theory ( in the sense specified in subsect.3.1 ) .",
    "let us recall that the metric homomorphisms of @xmath38 are strictly connected to the invariance under what we called the metric gaugement process of dsr ( see subsect.3.1 ) .",
    "concerning the influence of the extra dimension on the physics in the four - dimensional deformed space - time , points worth investigating are the possible connection between lorentz invariance in dr5 and the usual gauge invariance , and the occurrence of parity violation as consequence of space anisotropy when viewed from the standpoint of the space - time - energy manifold @xmath38 .",
    "a further basic topic deserving study in dsr is the extension to the non - abelian case of the results obtained for the abelian gauge fields ( like the e.m .",
    "one ) , based on the structure of the deformed minkowski space @xmath0 as generalized lagrange space ( see subsubsect.3.2.1 ) . in other words , it would be worth verifying if also non - abelian internal gauge fields can exist in absence of external fields , due to the intrinsic geometry of @xmath1 .",
