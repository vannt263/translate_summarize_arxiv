    "supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) are a class of high - mass x - ray binaries with ob supergiant companions . their hallmark is the occurrence of short ( @xmath0hours ) outbursts during which the luminosity can increase by 35 orders of magnitude ( typically , up to @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ) . either the clumpy structure of the wind from the companion or a centrifugal and/or magnetic gating have been suggested to be responsible for the outbursts .",
    "the hard - x - ray transient  was discovered by  in 2003 and later tentatively classified as an sfxt on the basis of its outbursting behaviour @xcite . at soft x - rays  observations showed a heavily absorbed pulsar with @xmath5 ks @xcite .",
    "an orbital periodicity of @xmath03.74 d was discovered with the /bat and the /asm @xcite and a hint of a total eclipse , consistent with a supergiant companion , has been observed in the bat data .",
    "we analyzed all the  data collected on , including a monitoring campaign carried out in 2011 july that spans over three orbital periods ( see @xcite for a complete log of the observations ) .",
    "for the binary orbital period analysis we retrieved from the bat transient monitor page @xcite the 1550kev bat light curves ( averaged over s orbital period of @xmath05400s ) covering the data range from 2005 february 12 to 2011 july 12 .",
    "fig.[igr16418:fig : batlcvphased](left ) shows the epoch - folded bat light curve for @xmath6d and mjd 53560.20000 as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the bat data show an eclipse centred at @xmath8 .",
    "the depth is consistent with a total eclipse , and the eclipse fwhm duration is @xmath9 of the orbital period .",
    "fig.[igr16418:fig : batlcvphased](right ) shows the 0.310kev xrt epoch - folded and background - subtracted light curve of the whole 2011 july campaign . in order to convert count rate to flux",
    ", we adopted conversion factors derived from spectral fits of each observation ( adopting a simple power - law model ) and subsequent interpolation across observations where fitting was not feasible ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the data start at phase 0.16 and cover three full periods . superimposed on the long - term orbital modulation , which follows that seen with bat , flaring is observed on short time scales ( a behaviour typical of most sfxts ) . in particular",
    ", the eclipse lasts @xmath10 and is centred at @xmath8 .",
    "the  folded light curves of the source show a dip consistent with zero intensity .",
    "if interpreted as an eclipse , it can be used to infer the nature of the stellar companion . excluding the eclipse ,",
    "the bat lightcurve does not show substantial flux modulation along the orbit , suggesting that the eccentricity is not large .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that in many x - ray binary systems with nearly circular orbits and short orbital periods ( @xmath114days ) , the eccentric orbit produced by the explosion of the supernova is circularized on timescale of @xmath12yr ( consistent with the evolution timescale of an o star ) , due to viscous tidal interactions .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we assume a circular orbit ( @xmath13d ) . let us adopt the typical values of stellar masses and radii @xcite for a primary of spectral type o8.5 and luminosity classes i , iii , or v , and for the neutron star a mass of @xmath14m@xmath15 , and a radius of @xmath16 km . by combining kepler s third law with the relationship given by @xcite for the radius of the primary @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the semi - major axis of the orbit",
    ", @xmath20 is the inclination , and @xmath21 is the eclipse semi - angle , we find that the observed @xmath22 is inconsistent with a luminosity class iii or v primary . we conclude that indeed the primary is an o8.5i supergiant star ( with mass , radius , luminosity , effective temperature given by @xcite , @xmath23m@xmath15 , @xmath24r@xmath15 , @xmath25 , @xmath26k ) and that the distance to  is @xmath013kpc @xcite",
    ".    the xrt light curve shows a large dynamic range , up to 12 orders of magnitude within a single snapshot and of at least 3 orders of magnitude overall ( even when the low - flow flux measured during the eclipse is excluded ) . while this dynamic range is lower than that observed in the classical sfxts , which reach 45 orders of magnitude in dynamic range , it is indeed typical of intermediate sfxts ( e.g. igrj18483@xmath270311 ) . the 2011 february flare ( at phase @xmath00.27 in fig.[igr16418:fig : batlcvphased ] ) ,",
    "in particular , reached @xmath28erg @xmath29 s@xmath4 ( 210kev , unabsorbed ) , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath30 ergs@xmath4 at 13 kpc , which is typical of sfxt outbursts .           to reproduce the observed x - ray variability",
    ", we applied a clumpy wind model @xcite , which we briefly summarize here .",
    "this model assumes that the wind of ob supergiants is inhomogeneous , composed of dense clumps surrounded by a hotter and homogeneous wind .",
    "clumps follow a power - law mass distribution , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the normalization constant , @xmath33 is the mass of a clump , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 define the extrema of the mass range . assuming a spherical geometry for the clumps , the initial clump dimension distribution is given by @xmath36clumpss@xmath4 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the clump .",
    "the clump mass loss rate @xmath38 is related to the total mass loss rate @xmath39 by means of @xmath40 , the fraction of wind mass in the form of clumps .",
    "clumps and the homogeneous wind follow the @xmath41__-velocity _ _ law @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath41 is a constant in the range @xmath0@xmath43 , @xmath44 is the radius of the supergiant and @xmath45 is the terminal wind velocity .",
    "each  snapshot has a duration of @xmath46ks , for a total of up to @xmath47ks per day , which is the typical timescale for the flare durations observed in sfxts .",
    "for this reason , we can not establish for  the number of observed flares and their duration , therefore we can not use this information to compare the observed lightcurve with that calculated with the clumpy wind model . however , it is possible to compare the observed cumulative luminosity distribution out of eclipse with that calculated with the model . for the former , the _",
    "swift_/xrt count rate , measured in the @xmath48@xmath49kev , was converted to the @xmath50@xmath51kev luminosity using the average spectral parameters obtained by @xcite , and for a distance of 13kpc .",
    "for the latter , we adopted the physical parameters for the o8.5i primary and the neutron star secondary reported above , and reasonable the force multiplier parameters for a o8.5i star ( see * ? ? ? * ) : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "fig.3 shows the xrt cumulative luminosity distribution ( solid line ) with its 90% uncertainties ( dashed lines ) and also the cumulative luminosity distribution ( red dot - dashed line ) calculated with the clumpy wind model by adopting the following parameter values : mass loss rate @xmath55m@xmath15yr@xmath4 , terminal velocity @xmath56kms@xmath4 , @xmath57 , fraction of mass lost in clumps @xmath58 , mass distribution power - law index @xmath59 , power - law index of the initial clump dimension distribution @xmath60 , minimum clump mass @xmath61 g and maximum clump mass @xmath62 g .",
    "further acceptable solutions can be found with the wind parameters in the ranges reported in table1 .",
    "the wind parameters obtained for  are roughly in agreement with those typical of hmxbs , with the exception of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the obtained low value of the terminal velocity can be explained as follows : when the wind is highly ionized by the x - ray photons emitted by the neutron star , the high ionization modifies the dynamics of the line - driven stellar wind of ob supergiants ( especially in close binary systems ) , leading to a reduction of the wind velocity in the direction of the neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mass loss rate is lower than the typical mass loss rate of o8.5i stars , which is of the order of @xmath65m@xmath15yr@xmath4 @xcite , but in agreement with the hypothesis that the mass loss rates derived from homogeneous - wind model measurements with the h@xmath66 method are overestimated by a factor of 210 if the wind is clumpy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that the x - ray variability of  is not totally due to the accretion of an inhomogeneous wind .",
    "in fact , other mechanisms could be at work , like e.g.  transient accretion discs and intermittent accretion flow onto a neutron star ."
