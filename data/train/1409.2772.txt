    "the important role played by the classical inequality of jensen in mathematics , probability theory , economics , statistical physics , information theory etc . is well known .",

    "the aim of this paper is to discuss a rather general condition under which the inequality of jensen works in a framework that includes a large variety of nonconvex functions and to provide on this basis applications to majorization theory and mathematical finance .",
    "the possibility to extend the inequality of jensen outside the framework of convex functions was first noticed twenty years ago by dragomirescu and ivan @xcite .",
    "later , pearce and peari @xcite and czinder and ples @xcite have considered the special case of mixed convexity ( assuming the symmetry of the graph with respect to the inflection point ) . for related results , see the papers of florea and niculescu @xcite , niculescu and spiridon @xcite , and mihai and niculescu @xcite .",
    "the inequality of jensen characterizes the behavior of a continuous convex function with respect to a mass distribution on its domain .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath0 is a continuous convex function on a compact convex subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a borel probability measure on @xmath1 having the barycenter @xmath4 then the value of @xmath0 at @xmath5 does not exceed the mean value of @xmath0 over @xmath6 that is,@xmath7    a moment s reflection reveals that the essence of this inequality is the fact that @xmath5 is a point of convexity of @xmath0 relative to its domain @xmath1 .",
    "the precise meaning of the notion of point of convexity is given in definition [ def1 ] below , which is stated in the framework of real - valued continuous functions @xmath0 defined on a compact convex subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 .",
    "[ def1]a point @xmath8 is a point of convexity of the function @xmath0 relative to the convex subset @xmath9 of @xmath1 _ _ if @xmath10 and @xmath11 for every family of points @xmath12 in @xmath9 and every family of positive weights @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15    the point @xmath16 is a point of concavity if it is a point of convexity for @xmath17 _ _ ( _ _ equivalently , if the inequality @xmath18 works in the reversed way__)__.    in what follows , the set @xmath9 that appears in definition 1 will be referred to as a  _ neighborhood of convexity _ of @xmath19 here , the term of _ neighborhood _ has an extended meaning and is not necessarily ascribed to the topology of @xmath20 in order to avoid the trivial case where @xmath21 we will always assume that @xmath9 is an infinite set ; for example , this happens when @xmath16 belongs to the relative interior of @xmath9 ( the interior within the affine hull of @xmath22 .    for the function @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24the origin is a point of convexity relative to the @xmath25 axis , and a point of concavity relative to the @xmath26 axis .",
    "with respect to the plane topology , both axes have empty interior .    if a function@xmath27 is convex , then every point of @xmath1 is a point of convexity relative to the whole domain @xmath1 ( and this fact characterizes the property of convexity of @xmath0 ) .",
    "definition 1 is motivated mainly by the existence of nonconvex functions that admit points of convexity relative to the whole domain ( or at least to a neighborhood of convexity where the function is not convex )",
    ". an illustration is offered by the nonconvex function @xmath28 for it , all points in @xmath29\\cup\\lbrack1,\\infty)$ ] are points of convexity relative to the entire real set @xmath30 .",
    "every point of local minimum of a continuous function @xmath31\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] is a point of convexity .",
    "thus , every nowhere differentiable continuous function @xmath31\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] admits points of convexity despite the fact that it is not convex on any nondegenerate interval .",
    "the idea of point of convexity is not entirely new . in an equivalent form ,",
    "it is present in the paper of dragomirescu and ivan @xcite .",
    "the technique of convex minorants , described by steele @xcite at pp .",
    "96 - 99 , is also closed to the concept of point of convexity .    a different concept of _ punctual convexity _ is discussed in the recent paper of florea and pltnea @xcite .",
    "the following lemma indicates a simple geometric condition under which a point is a point of convexity relative to the whole domain .",
    "[ lem1]assume that @xmath0 is a real - valued continuous function defined on a compact convex subset @xmath1 of @xmath20 if @xmath0 admits a supporting hyperplane at a point @xmath32 then @xmath16 is point of convexity of @xmath0 relative to @xmath33    in other words , every point at which the subdifferential is nonempty is a point of convexity .",
    "indeed , the existence of a supporting hyperplane at @xmath16 is equivalent to the existence of an affine function @xmath34 ( for suitable @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) such that@xmath37 if @xmath3 is a borel probability measure , its barycenter is given by the formula@xmath4 so that if @xmath38 then @xmath39    another sufficient condition for the convexity at a point , formulated in terms of secant line slopes , can be found in the papers of niculescu and stephan @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , as shows the case of polynomials of fourth degree , that condition does not overcome the result of lemma 1 .",
    "as is well known , the usual property of convexity assures the existence of a supporting hyperplane at each interior point .",
    "see @xcite , theorem 3.7.1 , p. 128 .",
    "this explains why jensen s inequality works nicely in the context of continuous convex functions .    in the case of differentiable functions ,",
    "the supporting hyperplane is unique and coincides with the tangent hyperplane . for such functions ,",
    "lemma 1 asserts that every point where the tangent hyperplane lies above / below the graph is a point of concavity / convexity .    in the one real variable case , the existence of points of convexity of a nonconvex differentiable function ( such as @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 etc .",
    ") can be easily proved by looking at the position of the tangent line with respect to the graph .",
