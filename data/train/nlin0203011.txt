    "in the xix - th century one of the most favorite subjects of the differential geometry @xcite was investigation of special classes of surfaces ( or , more appropriate , coordinate systems on surfaces and submanifolds ) which allow for transformations exhibiting the so called _",
    "permutability property_. such transformations called , depending on the context , the darboux , bianchi , bcklund , laplace , moutard , koenigs , combescure , lvy , ribaucour or the fundamental transformation of jonas , can be also described in terms of certain families of lines called line congruences  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that most of the `` interesting '' submanifolds is provided by reductions of conjugate nets , and the transformations between such submanifolds are the corresponding reductions of the fundamental ( or jonas ) transformation of the conjugate nets .    from the other side",
    "such submanifolds are described by solutions of certain nonlinear partial differential equations , which turn out to be extensively studied in the modern theory of integrable systems ; here also the existence of transformations ( called in this context the darboux transformations ) appears to be essential .",
    "for example , the conjugate nets , their iso - conjugate deformations and transformations are described  @xcite by the so called multicomponent kadomtsev  petviashvilii hierarchy , which is considered often as the basic system of equations of the soliton theory @xcite .",
    "recently the integrable discrete ( difference ) versions of integrable differential equations attracted a lot of attention ( see , for example , articles in @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in discrete integrable systems is stimulated from various directions , like numerical methods , theory of special functions , but also from statistical and quantum physics @xcite .",
    "the discrete integrable systems are considered more fundamental then the corresponding differential systems .",
    "discrete equations include the continuous theory as the result of a limiting procedure , moreover different limits may give from one discrete equation various differential ones .",
    "furthermore , discrete equations reveal some symmetries lost in the continuous limit .    during last few years",
    "the connection between geometry and integrability has been observed also at a discrete level .",
    "the present paper is the next one in the series of attempts to construct the integrable discrete geometry  the theory of lattice submanifolds described by integrable difference equations .",
    "the natural discrete analogs of certain coordinate systems on surfaces were studied by sauer  @xcite .",
    "in particular , he introduced the discrete conjugate nets in @xmath0 as lattices with planar elementary quadrilaterals .",
    "the importance of the discrete conjugate nets ( the quadrilateral lattices ) in the soliton theory was recognized recently in  @xcite .",
    "the darboux - type transformations of the quadrilateral lattices have been found in  @xcite , and the geometry of these transformations was investigated in detail in  @xcite . in the literature @xcite there are known various integrable reductions of the quadrilateral lattices .",

    "the homogeneous coordinates @xmath3 of the net satisfy the laplace equation @xmath4 where comma denotes differentiation ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are functions of the conjugate parameters @xmath9 of the net .",
    "its laplace transforms @xmath10 are another conjugate nets such that the @xmath11-tangents of @xmath12 coincide with the corresponding @xmath13-tangent lines of @xmath14 and that the @xmath13-tangents of @xmath12 coincide with the corresponding @xmath11-tangent lines of @xmath15 ( see figure [ fig : conj - net - k ] ) .",

    "when there is one conic of this pencil with the second order contact with the @xmath13-curve of @xmath14 and with the second order contact with the @xmath11-curve of @xmath15 then the net is called _ the net of koenigs_. it turns out that the laplace equation of the koenigs net can be gauged into the form @xmath16    the integrable discrete analogue of two - dimensional conjugate net is a @xmath17-lattice made of planar quadrilaterals @xcite .",
    "one can construct for such lattices @xcite the analogue of the laplace transforms @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the plane of the elementary quadrilateral at a point @xmath18",
    "there is a pencil of conics passing through the points @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the laplace transform @xmath14 and passing through the points @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the laplace transform @xmath15 ; we have replaced the tangency to a curve by its natural discrete analogue of passing through two neighbouring points of the discrete parametric curve .",
    "when there is one conic of this pencil passing through @xmath23 and passing through @xmath24 then we call such a lattice _ the koenigs lattice_.    the reduction of the fundamental transformation of conjugate nets to the class of the koenigs nets is called _ the transformation of koenigs_. such transformation is determined only by the half of the data of the fundamental transformation : given congruence conjugate to the koenigs net then the second koenigs net @xmath25 is the harmonic conjugate of @xmath12 with respect to the focal nets of the congruence .",
    "the discrete analogue of this construction is more subtle .",
    "one can show that @xmath25 is the image of @xmath12 in an involution on the corresponding line of the congruence .",
    "this involution is uniquely defined by the focal nets of the congruence ; in the continuous case the focal points are the double points of the involution @xcite    we have sketched the main ideas and results of the paper",
