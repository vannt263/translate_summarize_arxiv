    "quantum entanglement represents a resource that can be used for many applications , such as teleportation [ 1 ] , superdense coding [ 2 ] , quantum cryptographic key distribution [ 3 ] and entanglement enhanced communication complexity [ 4 ] .",
    "much progress has been made in the analysis of bipartite entanglement of pure and mixed states .",
    "the characterization of multiparticle entangled states is , however , much harder to attain , as some key theorems that apply to the bipartite states can not be easily extended to the multipartite case .    in the case of bipartite pure states",
    "a single satisfactory measure of entanglement has been found [ 5,6 ] : the partial von neumann entropy of one of the parties .",
    "this quantity equals both the states s distillable entanglement ( the number of epr pairs that can be asymptotically obtained from it using only classically coordinated local operations ) and the state s entanglement of formation ( the number of epr pairs necessary to asymptotically build the state with classically coordinated local operations ) .",
    "the characterization of entanglement in multiparticle states is still an elusive goal .",
    "there seems to be qualitatively different kinds of entanglement in n - partite states , making it hard to even find higher bounds for the number of different kinds of entangled states necessary to build n - partite states irreversibly [ 7 ] .    in this work",
    "we describe a protocol for creating any n - partite pure state @xmath0 using only local operations and classical communication between the n parties ( n - locc ) , and a certain number of epr pairs . as has been discussed before",
    "[ 8 ] , any measure of entanglement must be non - increasing under n - locc .",
    "this will enable us to identify the number of epr pairs used as an upper bound for the bipartite entanglement of formation @xmath1 .",
    "it is likely that multipartite states will be built from epr pairs in future practical applications of multiparticle entanglement ; our protocol would then provide bounds for the efficiency of such a procedure .",
    "we also hope that our approach may help clarify the relations between bipartite and multipartite entanglement , still a problematic theoretical issue .",
    "our protocol needs to rely on an asymptotically large number of epr pairs , creating a correspondingly large number of copies of the desired n - partite state @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath1 will then be bounded from above by the number of epr pairs used per copy of @xmath0 generated .",
    "we note that in general the procedure will be irreversible .",
    "in this section we describe a protocol that builds a large number of copies of an arbitrary n - partite pure state using n - locc and epr pairs only .",
    "let us first see how it would work for an arbitrary 3-qubit pure state @xmath3 .",
    "the basic idea is very simple and consists of distributing the state using a series of teleportations , keeping track of the amount of epr pairs used in each step .",
    "let us suppose that we start with a large number @xmath4 of copies of @xmath2 at charlie s laboratory .",
    "let us label the three qubits according to their von neumann entropies , qubit 1 being the one with least entropy @xmath5 , and so on in ascending order .",
    "the first step is to do quantum data compression [ 9 ] on the sub - ensembles corresponding to qubits 1 and 2 , resulting in two groups of particles asymptotically containing @xmath6 and @xmath7 maximally compressed qubits",
    ".    now charlie teleports the set corresponding to qubit 1 to alice and the other set to bob .",
    "thanks to the data compression we performed , these two teleportation steps will require only @xmath8 epr pairs shared with alice and @xmath7 with bob . to end the process we decompress the sets at alice and bob , asymptotically recovering @xmath4 qubits at each party with negligible error .",
    "the resulting state consists of @xmath4 copies of @xmath3 distributed among the 3 parties .",
    "the above discussion shows us that an arbitrary 3-partite pure state can be built using 3-locc and a bipartite entanglement of @xmath9 epr pairs , if we consider the manipulation of a large number of copies of the state .    this protocol can be simply generalized for any number of parties @xmath10 . to see how ,",
    "let us first recall the sub - additivity property of von neumann entropies : if a and b are subsystems of a larger system ab , their entropies must obey the inequality    @xmath11    in order to create the n - partite distributed state @xmath12 using our protocol we will need to perform @xmath13 teleportations .",
    "each teleportation takes the compressed sub - ensemble corresponding to subsystem @xmath14 ( which may include one or more of the final parties subsystems we want to distribute ) from one party to another , using @xmath15 epr pairs in the process . due to the sub - additivity property of entropy ,",
    "the most economical series of teleportations will , in general , involve teleporting larger subparts of @xmath2 first , in order to save on the number of epr pairs used in total . as an example , in order to distribute a state among 4 parties a , b , c and d , it may be advantageous to first teleport the compressed subsystem cd from site a to site c , and then teleport subsystems b and d to their respective sites .",
    "we are interested in finding the best series of teleportations from a list of all possible sequences of @xmath13 teleportations that distribute the n - partite state @xmath2 from a single location .",
    "this optimal series of teleportations can be found through an exhaustive search and constitutes what we shall call * protocol p1 * for creating @xmath16 ; the number of epr pairs used per copy of state @xmath3 created will be called * * p1(**@xmath17 * ) * for short .",
    "an example of the use of protocol p1 for a simple 4-partite system can be seen in fig . 1 .",
    "epr pairs per copy .",
    "protocol p1 invokes the most economical sequence of teleportations , one of which in this case is : first subsystem ab from c , and then the other 2 teleportations , spending the optimal amount of @xmath18 epr pairs.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this section we calculate @xmath19 for some multipartite states of interest .",
    "we will see that protocol p1 is not optimal , at least for some classes of states .",
    "@xmath19 will then represent an upper bound for @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath20 will also be an upper bound for the amount of bipartite entanglement distillable from @xmath2 , as this quantity is bounded from above by @xmath21 .",
    "the tripartite case is especially simple : if the three sub - systems of @xmath0 have entropies @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( labeling the systems such that @xmath24 ) , then @xmath25 @xmath9 epr pairs . in the case of an n - partite state @xmath26 ( @xmath10 )",
    "there is not such a closed formula for p1(@xmath26 ) ; as we discussed above , in order to find p1(@xmath26 ) we will need to find the most economical series of @xmath13 teleportations that will distribute @xmath27 .",
    "let us apply protocol p1 to build a generalized n - ghz state    @xmath28    which is a maximally entangled state of n qubits , also known as a n - cat state .",
    "if x is a non - trivial subset of the parties , then the reduced density matrix of subset x is defined as    @xmath29    the n - ghz states have the property that for every non - trivial subset x we have @xmath30 .",
    "this means that we use exactly 1 epr pair in each teleportation step , no matter which subsystem of @xmath31 we choose to teleport . therefore , all sequences of teleportations that distribute the state @xmath32 will use exactly the same amount of epr pairs , this number being    @xmath33    since all teleportation sequences are equivalent , we may as well choose one in particular : let us consider the one that distributes each subsystem directly to its definitive party , thus teleporting @xmath13 qubits from a single location . since each qubit is in a maximally mixed state , the quantum data compression would be of no use , making it unnecessary for us to operate on multiple copies of the state .",
    "this establishes the correspondence between protocol p1 and the one by zeilinger _",
    "[ 10 ] for building a single copy of a n - ghz state of n qubits from @xmath13 epr pairs .",
    "protocol p1 is as efficient as zeilinger s , but has a different physical meaning : we are simply teleporting each party s subsystem from a single location , using a total of @xmath13 epr pairs .",
    "the above discussion generalizes trivially for the case of n - ghz states in which each party possesses k - level subsystems instead of qubits .",
    "incidentally , the n - ghz states represent the worst case scenario for protocol p1 , in the sense that a single copy of _ any _ n - partite state of n qubits can be prepared locally and distributed using @xmath34 epr pairs .",
    "it is not known whether p1 is optimal for n - ghz states .",
    "these are states which can be written in schmidt form    @xmath35    where the @xmath36 represent an orthonormal basis in party x s hilbert space .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath37 may be made to be real by convenient redefinition of the basis vectors .",
    "for these states all reduced density matrices @xmath38 have the same von neumann entropy of @xmath39 , and therefore    @xmath40    bennett _ et al . _",
    "[ 7 ] showed that a state @xmath41 can ( in the asymptotic limit of many copies ) be transformed reversibly by n - locc into a set of @xmath42 n - ghz states of n qubits .",
    "thus we may achieve the creation of @xmath41 by two different routes : either using p1 directly or first creating @xmath42 n - ghz states with p1 and then using bennett _",
    "et al . _ s procedure to turn them into @xmath41 .",
    "we have seen above that @xmath43 epr pairs , which means that the two routes demand the same number of epr pairs for creating the state . in view of this",
    ", we see that p1 s optimality for creating n - ghz states ( if it can be proved ) would mean p1 would be an optimal protocol for schmidt decomposable n - partite states as well .",
    "let us consider the n - partite state @xmath45 consisting of @xmath46 shared epr pairs , one between each pair of parties .",
    "this state has been named a n - toast state after the custom of clinking glasses during a toast [ 7 ] .",
    "we choose these states here as an example of the inefficiency of p1 for some classes of states .",
    "the most economical series of teleportations that builds @xmath47 consists again of teleporting each party s subsystem directly from an initial party . in order to see this ,",
    "let us calculate the entropies of the reduced density matrices corresponding to all non - trivial sets of parties @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the reduced density matrix corresponding to an arbitrary set of m parties ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "given this partition of the set of parties , the @xmath44 epr pairs in state @xmath47 can be grouped in three categories : @xmath50 shared between parties in @xmath48 ; @xmath51 shared between parties in @xmath52 ; and @xmath53 shared between a party in @xmath48 and another in @xmath52 . the trace operation over the @xmath54 parties will result in a @xmath14 that is a tensor product of the @xmath50 epr pairs within @xmath48 and the identity matrix corresponding to the epr pairs that were ` broken ' between @xmath48 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus we have    @xmath56    the entropy of @xmath38 can then be easily evaluated to be @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath15 corresponds to the number of epr pairs necessary to teleport subsystem @xmath38 as part of protocol p1 .",
    "since p1 consists of @xmath58 teleportations , we can not hope to perform p1 and use less than    @xmath59    epr pairs ( where the minimum is taken over all possible @xmath48 ) .",
    "this is actually achievable , as we may teleport each party s subsystem directly from an initial one , using a total number of epr pairs equal to    @xmath60    the fact that state @xmath45 consists of a collection of @xmath44 epr pairs makes it obvious that @xmath61 , which is clearly below @xmath62 . for these states",
    "@xmath63    which shows that our protocol is particularly inefficient for @xmath47 states ",
    "@xmath64 is as high as twice the actual bipartite entanglement of formation for large @xmath65 .",
    "we have just seen that protocol p1 is not optimal .",
    "this inefficiency prompts us to obtain bounds for @xmath21 using other methods , as a way of assessing the protocol s shortcomings .",
    "this can be done for the specific case of n - ghz states by appealing to a recent theorem proved by julia kempe [ 11 ] :    * definition * : _ two n - partite states are said to be n - locc incommensurate when they can not be transformed into each other either way by any n - locc protocol . _    * theorem * ( kempe ) : _  two n - partite states _",
    "@xmath3 _ _  and _ _ @xmath26 _ _  are n - locc incommensurate if and only if they are not equivalent under local unitary transformations at each party . _ _",
    "kempe applied this theorem to prove that @xmath13 n - ghz states and an @xmath47 state are n - locc incommensurate . in both cases",
    "the density matrices of each party are identical and equal to    @xmath66    the @xmath45 state has inseparable @xmath38 for any choice of x other than a single party ( see eq .",
    "( [ rox ] ) ) .",
    "the state consisting of @xmath13 n - ghz s has separable @xmath38 for all choices of x. using kempe s theorem and the fact that local unitaries can not increase entanglement between parties , we prove that the states under consideration are n - locc incommensurate .",
    "a similar result was also obtained by bennett _",
    "et al . _ in [ 7 ] .    we will now argue that this result holds true for exact transformations between arbitrarily large numbers of copies of n - ghz and epr states .",
    "let us consider the two following n - partite systems : the state @xmath67 consisting of a tensor product of @xmath68 n - ghz states of n qubits , each party possessing a subsystem with @xmath68 qubits in state    @xmath69    and state @xmath70 consisting of the tensor product @xmath71 , with each party s subsystem in state    @xmath72    we will have equal density matrices at each party for @xmath67 and @xmath70 if @xmath73 making it possible for us to apply the same reasoning as we did above for the case with 2 ghz and 3 epr states .",
    "thus we have established that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are incommensurate states . in particular , this means that we need strictly more than @xmath76 epr pairs to create one n - ghz state , no matter how clever our n - locc protocol is . in all of the above",
    "we have been considering exact transformations between the states . in references",
    "[ 5,7 ] the authors define larger equivalence classes between n - partite states , allowing for slightly imperfect fidelity @xmath77 in the transformation and for @xmath78 that deviates from 1 by a small quantity @xmath79 . the question of whether the bound of @xmath80 epr pairs per n - ghz state created holds for the transformations considered in [ 5,7 ] is open .    combining the lower bound of @xmath80 epr pairs per n - ghz with the higher bound given by protocol p1 , we can write : @xmath81 it is interesting to note that the above result implies that there is a fundamental irreversibility when we transform n - partite entanglement into bipartite and vice - versa , using exact transformations of a large number of copies .",
    "for example , a 3-ghz can not be asymptotically converted into @xmath82 of an epr pair , yet we need strictly more than @xmath82 of an epr pair to asymptotically recreate a 3-ghz .",
    "p1 is obviously optimal for a trivial set of states , such as that on fig .",
    "1 . it is , however , inefficient for states like that of section [ sec sym epr ] above . for n - ghz states ,",
    "as far as we know , there is no known protocol more efficient than p1 , and inequality ( [ bound for ghz ] ) represents what seems to be the best bounds as yet for their bipartite entanglement of formation .",
    "if it can be proved that p1 is optimal for n - ghz  states , then it would be optimal for schmidt decomposable n - partite states as well , as we discussed in section [ schmidt ] above .",
    "protocol p1 is not the most general protocol using quantum data compression and teleportation to build multipartite states .  in this section",
    "we will briefly describe three successive generalizations .",
    "these generalizations all involve taking advantage of the fact that each party s system may beconsidered as consisting of subsystems which can be compressed and teleported independently .",
    "first we describe protocol p2 .",
    "take an n - partite state in the hilbert space @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 are the parties ) .",
    "now , it may be the case that some or all of the spaces @xmath85,@xmath86 can themselves be written as tensor products of smaller spaces .",
    "for example , we may write the space @xmath85 as a tensor product of @xmath87 spaces    @xmath88    writing the hilbert space in this way corresponds to dividing each party s system into subsystems .",
    "the most general way of doing this for a party @xmath89 is the following .",
    "we first write @xmath90 as the product of its prime factors .",
    "if there are @xmath87 such prime factors then we can regard @xmath89 as consisting of @xmath87 subsystems , each having the dimension of one of the prime factors .",
    "all possible subsystems of system @xmath89 consist either of these @xmath91 prime - dimensional subsystems , or of the composite - dimensional subsystems obtained by grouping these in different ways .  to obtain the most general way of identifying subsystems we can consider performing unitary transformations at each party , either passively ( on the hilbert space ) or actively on the system itself ( in which case we would need to undo the transformation at a later stage ) .",
    "now let us see the steps that constitute protocol p2 .",
    "we start by preparing many copies of the state we wish to build at one location .",
    "then we consider all possible ways in which the systems @xmath84 ( which must be distributed to each party ) can be decomposed in a tensor product of prime - dimensional subsystems .",
    "the idea now is to analyze all possible ways in which these subsystems , or groups of them , can be successively compressed at one party , teleported and decompressed at another party .",
    "protocol p2 is taken to be the most efficient way of building the n - partite state by such a series of teleportations of subsystems .",
    "this protocol will be optimal for any state that consists of a tensor product of shared bipartite states , in particular for @xmath65-toast states.this becomes clear if we consider a simple example . take a 3-toast state    @xmath92    we have seen that p1 is inefficient at creating n - toast states ; p1 would take 4 epr pairs to create this tensor product of 3 epr pairs .",
    "we write system @xmath89 as being composed of two 2-dimensional subsystems @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 composed of subsystems @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and @xmath98 of @xmath99and @xmath100 .",
    "this state can be built in three teleportation steps .",
    "we start with many copies of @xmath101 at location @xmath102 first we teleport system @xmath99 to location @xmath98 ( since subsystem @xmath99 is maximally mixed there is no need to compress it ) .",
    "then we take subsystems @xmath103 and @xmath100 and , regarding them as one subsystem , we compress and teleport them to location @xmath95 , where they can be decompressed .",
    "finally , we teleport subsystem @xmath100 from location @xmath95 to location @xmath98 ( again , there is no need for compression ) .",
    "each of these three steps requires one epr pair per copy of @xmath101 and hence this procedure is optimal , constituting an example of p2 .",
    "it is clear that this protocol will be optimal for any state consisting of shared bipartite states .",
    "protocol p2 reduces to p1 in the case where all systems @xmath84 have a prime number of dimensions ( thus being not decomposable ) .",
    "this observation motivates protocol p3 .  in protocol p3",
    "we allow the introduction of ancillary systems @xmath104 prepared in some known state .",
    "let system @xmath105 consist of @xmath89 and @xmath106 and similarly for @xmath107 .",
    "protocol p3 consists of applying p2 to the primed systems and optimizing also over all possible ancilla choices .",
    "the introduction of ancillae allows for greater flexibility of manipulation of the prime - dimensional subsystems , as unprimed systems with prime dimension may result in primed decomposable systems .",
    "it is easy to find examples of states for which protocol p3 is more efficient than both p1 and p2 .",
    "for example , let us consider the following tripartite state closely resembling the @xmath108 state , but in a 5x5x5 dimensional hilbert space :    @xmath109   \\notag \\\\ & + \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\left| 4,4,4\\right\\rangle ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have rewritten the @xmath101 state in a different form , adding a term proportional to @xmath110 and orthogonal to the space spanned by the @xmath101 state",
    ".    eigenvalues of density matrices that are continuous functions of a parameter @xmath111 are themselves continuous functions of @xmath111 [ 12 ] .",
    "hence , the entropies of the partial density matrices obtained from @xmath112 will differ from those of @xmath113 by arbitrarily small amounts , for suitable values of @xmath111 .",
    "we are now dealing with subsystems in a prime - dimensional ( 5 ) hilbert space , which means that we are unable to identify subsystems in each party s system and apply p2 .",
    "therefore    @xmath114    which is arbitrarily close to 4 , for small @xmath115 .",
    "protocol p3 improves on this by adding a 3-qubit ancilla to each 5-level system .",
    "we then map the state of each 5-level system into its ancilla through the unitary operation that takes ( for alice s system )    @xmath116    and similarly for bob s and charlie s systems .",
    "this amounts basically to increasing the dimensionality of each system from 5 to 8 , as we may discard the original systems and deal with the ancillae instead . since 8 is a composite number , now we can apply protocol p3 , which consists of finding the optimal way of distributing this 9-qubit system among alice , bob and charlie through teleportation . it suffices to say that the optimal way will be similar to the one we adopted when we applied protocol p2 to the @xmath117 state , with the difference that now we have one extra qubit at each party ( like ancillary bit @xmath118 in the example above ) which is minimally entangled with the rest of the system . by the same continuity argument we see that p3(@xmath26 ) is as close as we like to p2(@xmath101)@xmath119 , for small @xmath115 .",
    "this provides us with an example for which protocol p3 is better than both p1 and p2 .    the introduction of the ancillae in protocol p3 was not done in the most general way possible .",
    "we considered local operations at each party that entangled ancillae to the systems corresponding to a single copy of the state we want to prepare .",
    "as we have argued , this allows for a more general manipulation of the state , and perhaps to a more efficient series of teleportations that build it .",
    "we may , however , operate with a large number of copies of the state , introducing ancillae which couple to a certain number @xmath120 of copies , instead of a single one .",
    "then our basic units would consist of one ancilla for each set of @xmath120 copies of system @xmath89 , one for each @xmath120 copies of system @xmath95 , and so on up to the last system @xmath121.protocol p4 can then be defined as the application of p2 to these larger units , optimizing over @xmath120 and ancilla sizes .",
    "p4 is more general than p3 and may be more efficient for some states .",
    "we have described a protocol that can be used ( in the asymptotic limit of many copies ) to build any n - partite pure quantum state .",
    "protocol p1 uses quantum data compression and teleportation to distribute a large number of copies of the state among the n parties , consuming bipartite entanglement in the form of epr pairs .",
    "the efficiency of the protocol depends on the state we want to create .",
    "it is optimal for some simple states ( such as that in fig .",
    "1 ) , but can be shown to be inefficient for n - toast states , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec sym epr ] .",
    "its efficiency for arbitrary states is hard to evaluate , as there are not many results for the exact bipartite entanglement of formation @xmath21 of n - partite states .",
    "lower bounds for @xmath21 of n - ghz states are presented for comparison with p1 s results .",
    "we also show that proof of p1 s optimality for n - ghz states would imply its optimality for schmidt decomposable states as well .",
    "we consider some generalizations of protocol p1 , which can be shown to be more efficient than p1 for some classes of states ( such as n - toast states )",
