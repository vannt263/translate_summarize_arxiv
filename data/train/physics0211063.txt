    "in dense fluids , there are many interaction - induced phenomena that can be interpreted in terms of the dynamics of the pairs of atoms@xcite . for example , nuclear overheusser effect studies the relative motion of the atoms . in addition , an understanding of pair dynamics can be of great importance in the studies of rate of various diffusion controlled chemical reactions in dense fluids@xcite .",
    "both the theoretical analysis@xcite and computer simulation@xcite studies have been carried out extensively to study the dynamics of a pair of atoms in an one component liquid . surprisingly , however , we are not aware of any explicit study of the dynamics of atomic pairs in binary mixtures whose dynamics generally show strong nonmonotonic composition dependence@xcite .",
    "the study of the electronic spectroscopy of dilute chromophores ( solutes ) in fluids ( solvents ) is a useful tool for obtaining the information about the structure and dynamics of the solvents in the vicinity of the solute . in an attempt to provide a microscopic foundation of the kubo s stochastic theory of the line shape , skinner and coworkers@xcite",
    "have recently developed a molecular theory for the absorption and emission line shapes and ultrafast solvation dynamics of a dilute nonpolar solute in nonpolar fluids . due to the motion of the solvent molecules relative to the chromophore , the chromophore s transition frequency generally fluctuates in time .",
    "thus the nature of the spectral line shape provide a useful information about the details of the dynamics of the solvent relative to the solute .",
    "an approximate treatment of the solvent dynamics allowed the theory to express the transition frequency fluctuation time correlation functions ( related to the expressions for the absorption and emission line shapes ) solely in terms of the two - body solute - solvent time - dependent conditional pair distribution function .",
    "many other applications of pair dynamics have been discussed by a number of authors@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a liquid below its freezing temperature , that is , in a supercooled state , is far more complex than what one would expect from a naive extrapolation of their high - temperature behavior .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in the dynamics of a supercooled liquid is to understand quantitatively the origin of the non - exponential relaxation exhibited by various dynamical response functions and the extraordinary viscous slow - down within a narrow temperature range as one approaches the glass transition temperature from above@xcite .",
    "many experimental studies@xcite as well as computer simulations@xcite have been performed to shade light on the underlying microscopic mechanism involved in supercooled liquids .",
    "these studies have revealed the evidence of the presence of distinct relaxing domains ( spatial heterogeneity ) which is thought to be responsible for the non - exponential relaxations in deeply supercooled liquids .",
    "molecular motions in strongly supercooled liquid involves highly collective movement of several molecules@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the correlated jump motions become the dominant diffusive mode@xcite .",
    "the observed heterogeneity of the relaxations in a deeply supercooled liquid is found to be connected to the collective hopping of groups of particles@xcite .",
    "the occurrence of increasingly heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled liquids , however , has been investigated solely in terms of single particle dynamics .",
    "the study of the dynamics of pair of atoms which involve higher order ( two - body ) correlations thus can provide much broader insight into the anomalous dynamics of supercooled liquids . in this work ,",
    "we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations in a strongly non - ideal glass forming binary mixture ( commonly known as kob - andersen model@xcite ) to study the relaxation mechanism in terms of the pair dynamics .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to explore the dynamics in a more collective sense by following the relative motion of three different type ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) of nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor pair of atoms .",
    "these three pairs are found to behave differently .",
    "the simulation results show a clear signature of hooping motion in all the three pairs .",
    "we have also performed simple mean - field ( mf ) model ( as introduced by haan@xcite for one component liquid ) calculations to obtain the time dependent conditional pair distribution functions .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the details of the simulation and the model system used in this study .",
    "the simulation results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we have presented a mean - field model calculations for pair dynamics in binary mixture and the comparison is made with the simulation results .",
    "finally , we end with a few concluding remarks in sec . v.",
    "we performed a series of equilibrium isothermal - isobaric ensemble ( n p t ) molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a strongly non - ideal well - known glass forming binary mixture in three dimensions . the binary system studied here contains a total of @xmath11 particles consisting of two species of particles , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 number of @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles , respectively .",
    "thus , the mixture consists of @xmath16 of a particles and @xmath17 of b particles .",
    "the interaction between any two particles is modeled by means of shifted force lennard - jones ( lj ) pair potential@xcite , where the standard lj is given by @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote two different particles ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "the potential parameters are as follows : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the mass of the two species are same ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that in this model system the @xmath10 interaction ( @xmath28 ) is much stronger than both of their respective pure counterparts and @xmath29 is smaller than what is expected from the lorentz - berthelot mixing rules . in order to lower the computational burden the potential has been truncated with a cutoff radius of 2.5@xmath1 .",
    "all the quantities in this study are given in reduced units , that is , length in units of @xmath1 , temperature @xmath30 in units of @xmath31 , pressure @xmath32 in units of @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding microscopic time scale is @xmath34 .",
    "all simulations in the npt ensemble were performed using the nose - hoover - andersen method@xcite where the external reduced temperature is held fixed at @xmath35 .",
    "the external reduced pressure has been kept fixed at @xmath36 .",
    "the reduced average density @xmath37 of the system corresponding to this thermodynamic state point is 1.32 . throughout the course of the simulations , the barostat and the system s degrees of freedom",
    "are coupled to an independent nose - hoover chain@xcite ( nhc ) of thermostats , each of length 5 .",
    "the extended system equations of motion are integrated using the reversible integrator method@xcite with a time step of @xmath38 .",
    "the higher order multiple time step method has been employed in the nhc evolution operator which lead to stable energy conservation for non - hamiltonian dynamical systems@xcite .",
    "the extended system time scale parameter used in the calculations was taken to be @xmath39 for both the barostat and thermostats .",
    "the systems were equilibrated for @xmath40 time steps and simulations were carried out for another @xmath41 production steps following equilibration , during which the quantities of interest are calculated .",
    "the three partial radial distribution functions , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 obtained from simulations are plotted in figure 1 . due to the strong mutual interaction ,",
    "the ab correlation is obviously the strongest among the three pairs .",
    "the splitting of the second peak of both @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a characteristic signature of dense random packing .",
    "the structure of @xmath44 is interestingly different .",
    "it has an insignificant first peak which originates from the weak interaction between the b type particles .",
    "the second peak of @xmath44 is higher than that of the first peak signifying that the predominant bb correlation takes place at the second coordination shell .",
    "the occurrence of the splitted second peak is clearly observed here also .    in the present study ,",
    "the central quantity of interest is the _ time - dependent pair distribution function _ ( tdpdf ) ( first introduced by oppenheim and bloom@xcite in the theory of nuclear spin relaxation in fluids ) , @xmath45 which is the conditional probability that two particles are separated by @xmath46 at time @xmath47 if that pair were separated by @xmath48 at time @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the tdpdf measures the relative motion of a pair of atoms . for an isotropic fluid",
    ", the tdpdf depends only on the magnitudes of @xmath46 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 , where @xmath50 is the angle between @xmath46 and @xmath48 . in computer simulation",
    ", one can readily evaluate separately the radial and orientational features of the relative motion . in the following two subsections , we present , respectively , the results obtained for the time evolution of the radial part @xmath51 and the angular part @xmath52 of the tdpdf for the three different pairs ( aa , bb and ab ) .      in figure 2",
    "we plot the @xmath51 for the aa pair with the initial separation @xmath53 corresponds to the first maximum of the partial radial distribution function @xmath42 ( that is , pairs which are nearest neighbor ) at four different times . while at short time ( figure 2(a ) ) the distribution function has a single peak structure as expected , with increase in time it reaches slowly to its asymptotic limit where additional peaks develop at larger relative separations ( see figures 2(b)-2(d ) ) .",
    "the microscopic details of the underlying diffusive process ( by which it approach to the asymptotic structure ) can be obtained by following the trajectory of the relative motions .",
    "figure 3 displays the projections onto an x - y plane of the trajectory of a typical aa pair for the nearest neighbor a atoms over a time interval @xmath54 .",
    "the motion of the aa pair is shown to be relatively localized for many time steps and then move significant distances only during quick , rare cage rearrangements .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the jump motions are the dominant diffusive mode by which the separation between pairs of atoms evolve in time .    the behavior of the distribution function @xmath51 for the ab pairs ( where the interaction being the strongest ) is plotted in figure 4 at four different times .",
    "the distribution function shows the same qualitative behavior as we observed in the case of aa correlation ( figure 2 ) .",
    "when compared to the aa correlation function within the same time scale , the decay of the correlation function is found to be faster despite the much strong ab interaction .",
    "this must be attributed to the difference in size of the two types of particles .",
    "as the b particles are smaller in size than the a particles , they are more mobile . in addition , the ab interaction is such that ab repulsion is felt at relatively small distances ( @xmath29 = 0.8 instead of 0.94 according to the lorentz - berthelot rules ) .",
    "consequently , the b particles are more prone to make jumps than the a particles ( as observed earlier by kob and andersen@xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the relative motion of a typical ab pair is illustrated in figure 5(a ) , which display the trajectory of a typical ab pair ( in the x - y plane ) that were initially at the nearest neighbor ( first peak of @xmath43 ) .",
    "the elapsed time is @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamics of the relative motion is again dominated by hooping , the ab pair remain trapped at their initial separation over hundreds of time steps , before jumping to neighboring sites where they again become localized .",
    "further , the jump motion is more frequent for the ab pair than that for the aa pair .",
    "the individual trajectory of the a and b particles of the same ab pair within the same time window is shown in figures 5(b ) and 5(c ) , respectively .",
    "while both the a and b particles hop , b particles move faster and the effect of caging is weaker ( than the a particles ) due to its smaller size . in this time window",
    ", the net displacement of the ab pair in the x - y plane is found to be quite large as shown in figure 6 and mainly determined by the displacement of the b particle .    in figure 7",
    "we show @xmath51 for the bb pair initially separated at the first peak of @xmath44 at four different times . due to weak interaction among b particles",
    ", one expects that the b atoms in the bb pair will fast lose the memory of their initial separation .",
    "this is indeed the case for the bb pair shown in figure 7 .",
    "once again the jump dynamics is clearly seen in the trajectory of a typical bb pair projected in the x - y plane ( figure 8) .",
    "we now consider the case where the separation of the initial pairs corresponds to the second peak of their respective partial radial distribution functions of figure 1 ( that is , pairs which are next nearest neighbor ) .",
    "the distribution function for the aa pair is plotted in figure 9 .",
    "it shows a qualitative different behavior because the peak at the nearest neighbor separation develops in a relatively short time . here also the motion of the pairs are found to be mostly discontinuous in nature , thus motion from second to first nearest neighbor occurs mostly by hopping .",
    "in figure 10 we plot the similar distribution function of the ab pair . since the ab interaction is the strongest , the height of the first peak grows faster than that for the aa pair ( compare figures 9(b ) and 10(b ) ) .",
    "next , in figure 11 we plot the distribution function for the bb pair .",
    "contrary to the aa and ab pairs , bb pairs tend to retain their initial separation for a relatively long time compared to the nearest neighbor pair .",
    "this can be understood from the predominant bb correlations at the second coordination shell .      in this subsection",
    "we present the _ angular distribution function _ @xmath52 for the three different pairs ( aa , bb and ab ) .",
    "the initial separation @xmath53 for the three pairs corresponds to the first peak of the respective partial radial distribution functions ( figure 1 ) .    in figure 12(a ) we show the angular distribution @xmath52 for the aa pair .",
    "we calculate the angular distribution with respect to the initial separation vector @xmath55 and irrespective of the value of the separation at time t. the distribution which is a @xmath56-function at @xmath49 , spreads more and more with time and eventually it reaches to a uniform distribution with zero slope .",
    "when we compare to the distribution corresponding to the ab pair as shown in figure 12(b ) , we find that the approach to the uniform value is faster in the case of ab pair .",
    "this can be understood again in terms of the mobility of the b particles which is more compared to the a particles . in figure 12(c ) we show how the distribution for the bb pair changes with time .",
    "the relaxation is seen to be relatively slower at short times compared to the ab pair .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the effective potential , discussed later .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the time dependence of the mean square relative displacement @xmath57 , the simplest physical quantity associated with the pair motion , where the index @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote a and/or b particles and the subscript @xmath58 indicate the ensemble averaging is restricted to the pairs whose initial separation corresponds to @xmath53@xcite .",
    "first , we consider the case where the initial separations for the three pairs corresponds to the first peak of the respective partial radial distribution functions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in other words , we consider first those pairs that were initially nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "figure 13 shows the result for the time dependence of the relative mean square displacement ( msrd ) of the three pairs . at long times",
    "the msrd varies linearly with time .",
    "however , the evolution of msrd with time differs for different pairs .",
    "as expected , the smaller size of the b particles and the weak bb interaction leads to a faster approach of the diffusive limit of bb pair separation .",
    "the time scale needed to reach the diffusive limit is shorter for the ab pair than that for the aa pair .    from the slope of the curves in the linear region",
    "one can obtain the values of the relative diffusion constants @xmath59 of the different pairs .",
    "the values thus obtained are the following : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "one should note that even though the difference in size of the a and b particles is small , @xmath63 is almost twice of @xmath64 . at sufficiently long time , one would certainly expect the diffusion constant for the relative motion of a pair should be the sum of the individual diffusion constants of the two atoms obtained from the slope of the corresponding mean square displacements at long time .",
    "indeed , we find there is a good agreement .",
    "an investigation of the behavior of msrd is also performed for atomic pairs which were initially next nearest neighbor . when compared to the nearest neighbor pairs ( figure 13 ) we find that the slope of the corresponding straight lines are almost identical , although in the case of aa and ab pairs the diffusive limits are reached at shorter times .",
    "this has been shown in figure 14 .",
    "one should remember that the aa and ab correlations are highest at the first coordination shell whereas the highest bb correlations occur at the second coordination shell ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , at short time the increase in slope for the aa and ab pairs can be explained in terms of the decrease in correlations at the second coordination shell .      in a highly supercooled liquid",
    ", the single particle displacement distribution function @xmath65 ( known as the self - part of the van hove correlation function ) has an extended tail and is , in general , non - gaussian .",
    "the deviation from the gaussian behavior is often thought to reflect the presence of the transient inhomogeneities and can be characterized by the non - gaussian parameter @xmath66@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the second and fourth moments of @xmath65 , respectively . at intermediate time scale , @xmath66 increases with time and the maximum of @xmath66 occurs around the end of the @xmath70 relaxation region . only on the time scale of diffusion or the @xmath71 relaxation",
    ", @xmath66 starts to decrease and finally at very long time limit , it reaches to zero .",
    "@xmath66 calculated for the a and b particles are shown in figure 15 .",
    "the maximum in @xmath66 is seen to shift slightly towards left and also the height of the maximum is higher for the b particles .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the b particles probe much more heterogeneous environment than does the a particles .",
    "this difference can be explained in terms of the smaller concentration of b particles , different sizes of the a and b particles and also from the fact that the interaction between the b particles is much weaker than that between the a particles@xcite .    motivated by these findings for the single particle displacement distribution function , we introduce a new non - gaussianity parameter for the pair dynamics , denoted by @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath72 can be a measure of the deviation from the gaussian behavior of the pair distribution function @xmath45 .",
    "it can be defined as , @xmath73 where @xmath57 and @xmath74 are the mean square relative displacement and mean quartic relative displacement of the @xmath75 pair .",
    "one should note that @xmath72 is identical to zero for a gaussian pair distribution function .    in figure 16",
    "we show the behavior of the @xmath76 as a function of time for the three different pairs .",
    "we again consider only those pairs that were initially nearest neighbor . the behavior observed for the three pairs is markedly different .",
    "the dynamics explored by the bb pair is seen to be less heterogeneous than the aa and ab pairs .",
    "because of the smaller size of the b particles , the b particles reach the average distribution faster , although it explores larger heterogeneity .",
    "the aa pair reaches the diffusive limit at longer time scale than that for the ab pair , the ab pair explore more heterogeneous dynamics as is clearly evident from the difference in the maximum value of @xmath72 .",
    "for the motion of an atomic pair in a pure fluid , haan@xcite introduced a simple mean - field level equation of motion for the time - dependent pair distribution function @xmath77 .",
    "this equation was shown to give a quantitatively correct description both at short and long times@xcite .",
    "this treatment is mean - field in the sense that the two atoms were assumed to diffuse in an effective - force field of the surrounding particles given by the gradient of the potential of mean force .",
    "the equation for @xmath77 was represented by a smoluchowski equation and the correct short time description of @xmath77 was obtained only by introducing a _ nonlinear time that is related to the mean - squared distance _ ( msd ) moved by a _",
    "single atom_. in other words , an _ ad hoc _ introduction of a time - dependent diffusion constant @xmath78 in the equation of motion gives the correct description at short times .",
    "in the view of its success for one - component liquid , we have performed a similar mean - field model calculations for the binary mixture considered here .",
    "the generalization to binary mixture gives the following smoluchowski equation for the different pairs @xmath79,\\ ] ] where the index @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote a and/or b particles .",
    "@xmath70 is the inverse of the boltzmann s constant ( @xmath80 ) times the absolute temperature ( t ) .",
    "@xmath81 is the potential of mean force ( effective potential ) between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 particles given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the partial radial distribution function . in eq .",
    "4 , the `` time '' @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the mean square relative displacement ( msrd ) of the @xmath86 pair .",
    "note that an approximation is made in the above equation by neglecting the cross - correlation between the two particles ( i and j ) and the msrd is replaced by the sum of individual particle s mean square displacement ( msd ) .",
    "now the integration of the @xmath87 over the solid angles @xmath88 and @xmath89 corresponding to the initial and final positions , respectively , gives the radial part of the full distribution function ( the zeroth - angular moment of @xmath90 ) @xmath91 note that the normalization of this function is @xmath92 the equation of motion for @xmath93 ( derived from eq .",
    "4 ) is solved numerically ( by crank - nicholson method ) for the different pairs and the results obtained from this model calculations are compared with the simulation results .",
    "the partial radial distribution functions @xmath83 and the mean - square displacements of the a and b particles ( required as input ) are obtained from the present simulation .",
    "figures 17 and 18 compare model calculations with the simulated distribution functions for the aa and ab nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "the time evolution of the distributions are described well by the simple mean - field model .",
    "the underlying effective - potential energy surfaces are plotted in figure 19 .",
    "thus relative diffusion in these cases can be considered as overdamped motion in an effective potential , which takes place mainly via hopping ( as shown in figures 3 and 5 ) , which governs the time evolution of the distributions for the aa and ab pair .",
    "unfortunately , the good agreement observed above between simulation and theory for the aa and the ab pairs , does not extend to the bb pair .",
    "this is shown in figure 20 .",
    "as the number of b particles present in the system is much less ( 20 % ) and the interparticle interaction is weak , the effective potential for a b atom interacting with a nearest neighbor atom is unfavorable ( see the figure 19 ) .",
    "consequently , the nearest neighbor bb pairs execute highly anharmonic motions .",
    "thus , the fluctuations about the mean - force field experienced by the bb pair are large and important .",
    "these fluctuations are neglected here , as in other mean - field level description .",
    "the extension of the calculations to the case of next nearest neighbor pairs also been carried out and compared with the simulated distributions .",
    "it should be noted that compared to the nearest neighbor pairs , the aa and ab pairs are now executes motions in a relatively weak , shallow potential , whereas the motions of the bb pairs takes place in a relatively strong , bound potential well ( see the figure 19 ) .",
    "thus , for the bb pairs , one expects a better agreement with the simulated distributions compared to the earlier case ( nearest neighbor bb pairs ) .",
    "indeed , the agreement is better for the bb pairs , as shown in figure 21 ( compare with figure 20 ) .",
    "we have found that the mf model provides a good description of the dynamics of the aa and ab pairs , although the agreement is not as satisfactory as for the nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "thus , it is evident that the mf description for the time dependent pair distribution functions is reasonably good for the aa and ab pairs .",
    "simulation results have shown that the relative diffusion of an ab pair is higher than that for an aa pair .",
    "we noted that this due to more frequent hopping of b particles than the a particles .",
    "our main objective now is to see whether the frequent jump motions of the b particles , as predicted by the simulations , can be explained in terms of the mf model described above .",
    "we have performed an approximate calculation to get an estimate of the transition rate between the first two adjacent minima in the effective potential energy surface of the aa and ab pairs ( see the figure 21 ) . in other words , the rate of crossing from the deep minima located at the nearest neighbor pairs , to the adjacent minima ( corresponds to the next nearest neighbors ) . as the motion of a pair in the effective potential",
    "was treated by a smoluchowski equation , we use the corresponding rate expression in the overdamped limit to calculate the escape rate .",
    "thus , we have an expression for the escape rate given by@xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the arrhenius activation energy and @xmath96 , @xmath97 are the frequency at the minima ( @xmath98 ) and maxima ( @xmath99 ) in the effective potential @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath101 is related to the friction @xmath102 by @xmath103 .    thus , to calculate the transition rate we need to know the values of the frequencies @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the barrier height @xmath104 , which are different for the aa and ab pairs .",
    "for the aa pairs , these parameters are found to be @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , whereas for the ab pairs they are @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the relative diffusion of the two pairs are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "using all these parameters , the escape rate calculated for the aa and ab pairs are ( in reduced units ) @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively ( in terms of time @xmath113 , which is equal to 2.2 ps for argon units ) .    even though the barrier height @xmath114 , the transition rate for the ab pair is larger than that for the aa pair .",
    "thus , the jump motions are much more frequent for the ab pair , due to the large diffusion of the b particles in the potential energy surface ( which mainly occurs via hopping mode ) .",
    "let us first summarize the main results of this study .",
    "we have presented the molecular dynamics simulation results for the time dependent pair distribution functions in a strongly non - ideal glass forming binary lennard - jones mixture .",
    "in addition , a mean - field description of the pair dynamics is considered and the comparison is made with the simulated distributions . the main goal of this investigation was to explore the dynamics of the supercooled liquids in a more collective way , by following the _ relative _ motion of the atoms rather than _ absolute _ motion of the atoms .",
    "we find that the three pairs ( aa , bb and ab ) behave differently .",
    "the analysis of the trajectory shows a clear evidence of the jump motions for all the three pairs .",
    "the relative diffusion constant of the bb pair ( @xmath63 ) is almost twice the value for the aa pair ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this clearly suggests the importance of the jump dynamics for the b particles and indeed , we find that the motion of the b particles is mostly discontinuous in nature , while the a particles show occasional hopping . the dynamic inhomogeneity present in a supercooled liquid",
    "is generally characterized by the well - known non - gaussian parameter @xmath66 , which describe the deviations from the gaussian behavior in the motion of a single atom . in this paper , we have generalized this concept and introduce a non - gaussian parameter for the pair dynamics ( @xmath72 ) , to measure the deviations from the gaussian behavior in the relative motion of the atoms . at intermediate times , all the three pair distribution functions for the three pairs show significant deviations from the gaussian behavior , with different degree .",
    "it is found that for the nearest neighbor aa and ab pairs , which are confined to a strong effective potential and merely makes anharmonic motions in it , the dynamics can be treated at the mean - field level .",
    "however , as the motion of a nearest neighbor bb pair is highly anharmonic , one must include the effects of the fluctuations about the mean - force field , in order to get a correct description of the dynamics .    while the mean - field treatment provides reasonably accurate description of pair dynamics ( at least for aa and ab pairs ) , it must be supplemented with the time dependent diffusion coefficient ( d(t ) ) .",
    "this is a limitation of the mean - field approach because at present we do not have any theoretical means to calculate d(t ) from first principles .",
    "the mode coupling theory ( mct ) does not work because it neglects hopping which is the dominant mode of mass transport in deeply supercooled liquids , even when the system is quite far from the glass transition . as we discussed recently , the hopping can be coupled to anisotropy in the local stress tensor@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the latter is also non - trivial .",
    "work in this direction is under progress .",
