    "the panoply of structural , orbital and spin degrees of freedom and the joint presence of important electronic coulomb interactions cause correlated materials  @xcite to be the realm neither of band - theory nor of model many - body physics each on their own .",
    "therefore , in recent years , much ingenuity was invested into finding ways to merge the `` realism '' of the former with the accurate description of correlation effects of the latter .    with the exception of the gw approximation  @xcite to hedin s equations  @xcite ,",
    "the electronic structure approach gw+dmft  @xcite that combines gw with the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , and a recent proposal for a self - energy downfolding  @xcite , this combining commonly amounts to extracting a low - energy one - particle hamiltonian from density - functional - theory - based methods , such as the local - density approximation ( lda ) ,  @xcite supplementing it with interaction terms [ e.g.  of the hubbard - hund ( u and j ) type ] and to solving the resulting `` realistic model '' with a chosen many - body technique .",
    "hence , in this approach there are two intertwined preparative tasks that generate the many - body problem .",
    "the deducing of the low - energy one - particle part can be achieved e.g.  by a tight binding fit of relevant bands , the downfolding  @xcite procedure within e.g.  muffin - tin - based methods ,  @xcite or by the generation of ( maximally localized  @xcite ) wannier functions.@xcite    the interaction parameters of realistic many - body models , in turn , are often chosen rather empirically than from a solid first principles basis , a fact that has caused many objections in the past .",
    "in particular , when tracking properties as a function of an external parameter  pressure , in our case  the evolution of the interaction has mostly been discarded .",
    "this and the quest for going beyond mere qualitative results towards , eventually , the quantitative design of materials , highlights the need for accurate ways to determine all ingredients of realistic models in an _ ab initio _ fashion . nowadays , the most popular methods for the computation of interaction matrix elements are the constrained lda technique  @xcite , and the constrained random phase approximation ( crpa )  @xcite .",
    "a recent , and promising approach is the use of wannier functions within the crpa setup  @xcite , which allows for a deducing of the one - particle and two - particle parts of the hamiltonian on the same footing .",
    "moreover , working in a localized wannier type of basis is often a requirement of many - body approaches such as the dmft  @xcite . as to the interaction matrix elements",
    ", the crpa technique allows for a precise elimination of the screening channels of the chosen orbital subspace that constitutes the effective model  @xcite .",
    "while these techniques have already been applied for the setting up of many - body models of some complex materials  @xcite , a basic understanding of the effects of pressure on the coulomb interactions within a wannier setup is lacking .",
    "this is the aim of the current work .    in a first part",
    ", we investigate a semi - analytical tight binding model of a one - band solid in one dimension , track transfer matrix elements , the bare ( i.e.  unscreened ) coulomb interaction , and the spread of the maximally localized wannier orbitals as a function of lattice spacing .",
    "being able to access the decomposition of the maximally localized wannier functions onto the tight - binding basis will allow to understand the surprising finding that under pressure the coulomb interaction matrix element _ augments _ , while , at the same time , transfer elements describing the delocalization of electrons _ grow _ as well . as a more realistic example",
    ", we , second , apply the fully _ ab initio _ approach of the crpa within maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite to fcc hydrogen , which is found to exhibit the explained generic behavior of the bare coulomb interaction matrix elements .",
    "however , the partially screened coulomb interaction  the hubbard @xmath0 of an effective low energy model for the half - filled 1s orbital  actually shows a non - monotonous trend  a consequence of two opposing effects in screening processes .",
    "the method of using the wannier orbital construction in conjunction with the crpa technique has been presented in detail in ref .",
    "while not fully reviewing the approach , we will discuss some issues relevant for the understanding of our results and introduce some notation .",
    "for the one - particle band - structure , a density functional calculation is performed . for the realistic case of fcc hydrogen",
    ", we will employ the lda  @xcite in the full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto )  @xcite realization .",
    "for obtaining the random phase approximation ( rpa ) polarizations we employ the code of ref .",
    "@xcite with the maximally localized wannier extension of ref .",
    "@xcite , and construct an effective system for the isolated 1s orbital .",
    "that is , we introduce the sub - hilbert space @xmath1 , spanned by the 1s kohn - sham wave function .",
    "since the aim is to work within a localized basis , the extraction of the low - energy part is done by a construction of wannier functions  @xcite for @xmath2 , as described in refs .",
    "the corresponding effective interactions are then computed within the constrained rpa  @xcite formalism .",
    "this amounts to screening the matrix elements of the bare coulomb interaction @xmath3 , which in the wannier basis are given by @xmath4 with a partial rpa polarization @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the polarizations of the full and the sub - hilbert spaces , respectively .",
    "the latter @xmath7 , when using the kohn - sham orbitals , can be expressed as @xmath8 i.e.  by transitions restricted to the effective sub - system , in our case @xmath1 . within this notation ,",
    "the strengths of screening channels are influenced by two effects  : the matrix elements [ the overlap integrals of wave functions that occur when calculating matrix elements of @xmath6 , in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) ] , and the energy differences of the kohn - sham excitations , @xmath9 , that appear in the denominators .",
    "the virtue used for the constraining is the fact that the screening contributions are additive  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "when using the above decomposition @xmath10 , the fully screened interaction @xmath11 ( of the gw formalism  @xcite ) can be given in terms of the partially screened interaction for the effective model of the one - band orbital , @xmath12 , by @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the hubbard @xmath0 of the 1s sub - system is given by the on - site wannier function matrix element of @xmath14 .",
    "the major observation in this context is that the construction of wannier functions , and thus also the determination of interaction matrix elements are not unique  @xcite .",
    "indeed a unitary transformation applied to the periodic part of the wave functions , while preserving the bloch functions , changes the wannier orbitals .",
    "this gauge freedom can be used to choose the wannier basis that is most suitable for the final purpose .",
    "the aim of the low - energy system is to correct for local ( hubbard - type ) interaction effects . to this end , there exist at least two proposals on how to choose an optimal wannier basis set  : in the maximally localized wannier approach  @xcite the extension ( `` spread '' ) of the wannier functions is minimized  : denoting the wannier states by kets , @xmath15 , this spread can be chosen as  @xcite @xmath16      \\label{spread}\\ ] ] the minimization of this @xmath17 is of course only one of the possible options to fix the wannier functions , yet a very natural one , since it can e.g.  be shown  @xcite that , in one dimension , the resulting wannier functions are eigenfunctions of the subset projected position operator , an intuitive criterion for real space localization  .    in the second scheme , the screened local coulomb interaction matrix element  the hubbard @xmath0 , as given by the on - site component of @xmath14 from above ",
    "is maximized  @xcite to determine the wannier functions . for the case of srvo@xmath18",
    ", it has been shown  @xcite that both approaches yield very similar results . indeed , appealing to e.g.  the equation of the bare coulomb interaction matrix element in the wannier basis , eq .",
    "( [ eqv ] ) , it seems plausible that a greater localization of wannier functions ( smaller @xmath17 ) results in an increased interaction matrix element @xmath19 . for the simple model in one dimension that we discuss in the following , we in fact motivate the equivalence of the maximally localized wannier functions and the basis in which the ( bare ) coulomb interaction matrix element is maximal .",
    "however , we stress that the intuitive correspondence between a stronger localization of wannier functions , in the sense of the spread @xmath17 , and a larger interaction matrix element in this basis does not hold in general . here",
    ", one has to distinguish between the changes in the wannier localization that are induced by a modification of the wannier gauge from those caused by modifications of the lattice , caused e.g.  by pressure .",
    "the fact that for the discussed model , both methods to fix the wannier gauge are equivalent , states that _ for a given pressure _",
    "the maximally localized wannier functions yield the maximal coulomb interaction matrix element . yet , as we shall see , a _ pressure induced _ increase in the converged minimal wannier spread is actually quite naturally concomitant with a greater bare interaction .",
    "external pressure , or structural changes in general , provides an impetus to alter not only the one - particle band - structure of a material , but also the wannier functions .",
    "therefore , when investigating the pressure dependence of effective , i.e.  screened , interaction matrix elements , one has to distinguish between influences of the former , which enter via a modification of screening channels , and of the latter that not only affects the polarization , but , on a more fundamental level , modifies already the bare coulomb interaction matrix elements .",
    "the fact that wannier functions of a solid are not eigenfunctions of the system , may result in a nonstraightforward evolution when parameters such as external pressure change .      as a first model system",
    ", we investigate a tight - binding parametrization of a one - band solid in one dimension . in that case",
    "the maximally localized wannier function is naturally given by the fourier transform of the bloch functions when inversion symmetry is verified  @xcite . moreover , since no higher energy orbitals are present , no partial screening can occur [ in eq .",
    "( [ pr ] )  : @xmath20 and the hubbard @xmath0 equals the on - site matrix element of the bare coulomb interaction , @xmath21 .      as building blocks of the tight binding basis functions we opt for a hydrogen - like 1s orbital in one dimension",
    "@xmath22 with the bohr radius @xmath23 .",
    "this orbital is a solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation with a single binding delta potential  : it represents an eigenstate of the `` atomic '' hamilton operator @xmath24 with the eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "while the tight - binding approach with this orbital can in principle be used to approximate the bloch eigenfunction for a hamiltonian with any potential , its use is obviously most justified for a kronig - penney type of model  @xcite with a dirac - comb potential .",
    "the bloch function is written as  : @xmath26 here , the factors @xmath27 assure the orthonormality of the bloch function @xmath28 , and is determined to be  : @xmath29 where , with the lattice constant @xmath30 , and the integer @xmath31 , @xmath32 denotes the distance to the @xmath31th neighboring site .",
    "further , @xmath33 denotes the overlap integral between the atomic function at the origin and its @xmath31th neighbor , and is given by  : @xmath34      in one dimension , the maximally localized wannier function , @xmath35 , is given by the usual fourier transform of the bloch function if inversion symmetry is verified  @xcite . therewith @xmath36    where we defined @xmath37 or , with @xmath38 , and the reference @xmath39 , @xmath40 demanding @xmath41 , the normalization constant @xmath42 becomes  : @xmath43 the quantity @xmath44 is real for all @xmath45 for symmetry reasons .",
    "figure  [ figa1 ] shows its behavior for different lattice constants  : in the limit of large atomic separation ( @xmath46 ) , the overlaps @xmath33 are negligible , and the wannier function @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ psir ] ) , will equal the atomic orbital @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ 1s ] ) .",
    "thus the distribution @xmath44 picks up a single mode of the array , @xmath49 for the representative site `` 0 '' . when pressure is applied , and the lattice constant shrinks , finite overlaps of the ( non - orthogonal ) hydrogen orbitals entails contributions from neighboring sites to mix in , and the distribution @xmath44 broadens ( see figure  [ figa1 ] ) . since @xmath50   sum",

    ", @xmath55 is always positive ( @xmath51 ) , and becomes largest at the boundary .",
    "thus the momentum integral that would vanish without the denominator , becomes negative , since the modulation of the denominator gives the negative values a higher weight .",

    "the corresponding wannier functions of the above cases are shown in figure  [ figpsi ] . as anticipated from the above discussion , more weight",
    "is accumulated at the origin  : a harbinger for a larger on - site coulomb interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "contrary to the atomic limit , the tails of the wannier functions extend over several lattice constants , before the exponential decay sets in .",
    "this behavior at larger distance points to an increase in the wannier spread and the growing of transfer integrals .      since by symmetry , @xmath62 , the spread of the wannier function [ @xmath17 as given in eq .",

    "indeed the major contribution to the spread comes from the first term , making it plausible that the spread , as defined by @xmath64 , _ increases _ with a more widely distributed @xmath44 , as shown in figure  [ figa2 ] .",
    "although helpful for the understanding of the current model study , the spread is not too good a quantity for gaining quantitative insights from pressure studies of realistic systems , as we will discuss later .      for the transfer integral @xmath65 , we need to explicitly specify the non - interacting hamiltonian , @xmath66 , and , for simplicity , we shall choose a kronig - penny - type model  @xcite with an ionic dirac - comb potential , i.e.   @xmath67 then the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath68 can be expressed as  : @xmath69 as can be inferred from the dependence of the coefficients @xmath44 , eq .",

    ", we apply the fully _ ab initio _ approach  @xcite of the crpa within maximally localized wannier functions to the `` simplest '' realistic system , namely solid hydrogen .    while at low pressure , solid hydrogen forms a molecular crystal .",

    ", however , we shall not be interested with the precise phase diagram of solid hydrogen . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume throughout the discussion a face - centered cubic crystal structure with variable lattice constant . moreover , we are well aware that for the current case the problem of self - interaction  @xcite within the lda formalism is a particularly severe issue .",
    "however , here , we are not concerned with the accuracy of the lda band - structure but with compression induced trends in a 3d multi - orbital setup .",
    "for the one - particle band - structure , we employ in this work the lda in the full - potential fp - lmto  @xcite realization . in the lmto basis , we include orbitals up to the 4f , using local orbitals  @xcite for multiple orbitals per l - channel , and use a brillouin zone discretization with up to @xmath110 points . as described in ref .",

    "this is in complete analogy to what was shown in figure  [ figpsi ] for the model considered above .",
    "this is why the values of @xmath115 for large separation are below teh indicated @xmath116 . ] .",
    "it is thus expected that the on - site matrix element of the bare coulomb interaction @xmath117 grows under compression as before . and , indeed this is the case , as can be inferred from figure  [ fcch ] in the second panel from the bottom .",
    "yet , does that entail for the wannier spread @xmath17 the same behavior as witnessed in the one dimensional model  ? in three dimensions , the gain in spread by effects of hybridizations with neighboring sites might turn out less prominent , since the region occupied by nearest neighbor atoms is relatively small . hence ,",
    "the angular integral in @xmath17 , eq .  ( [ spread ] ) , even for the radius of the distance to the 12 neighboring atoms ( fcc ) will run very much over a sphere on which the wannier function is mostly zero . and , indeed , as displayed in the second panel from the top in figure  [ fcch ]",
    ", the wannier spread actually _ decreases _ under compression  the atomic value .",
    "again this is due to the inadequateness of the lda . ] .",
    "a direct interpretation of the spread in pressure studies has thus to be taken with caution .",
    "first , depending on the crystal - structure ( dimension , number and position of neighboring atoms ) the spread does not necessarily reflect the increased delocalization of charge carrier but can be dominated by the more isotropic concentration of weight at the origin ( see figure  [ fcchpsi ] ) .",
    "second , as seen in figure  [ fcch ] ( and already in the seminal work , ref .",
    "@xcite , table i ) , the momentum space convergence of @xmath17 is poor .",
    "also , a change in lattice constant upon compression , changes the accuracy of the spread function when the number of k - points is kept constant . while the spread is of course the entity that is minimized in order to obtain the maximally localized wannier functions for a given pressure , the spread itself is not a reliable measure for trends in the wannier functions upon compression . instead , one should either plot the functions , or resort to the bare coulomb interaction matrix elements , which  owing to the different powers of the position operator  converges well for a moderate k - point sampling .    in the current case , while still constructing an effective _ one_-band model , the initial system contains higher energy orbitals . as a result , and",
    "contrary to the simple tight - binding model , there is a non - zero partial polarization , @xmath118 of eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) , that screens the bare coulomb interaction @xmath19 .",
    "the on - site part of the screened interaction @xmath119  the hubbard @xmath0  within crpa is displayed in the lowest panel of figure  [ fcch ] .",
    "interestingly , this quantity , in contrast to the bare interaction , shows a non - monotonic behavior , that reflects the struggle of two opposing effects in the polarization @xmath118 . as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) , and the equation for @xmath7 , eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) , the changes in the polarization @xmath118 originate from modifications of transitions from the wannier `` 1s '' into orbitals at higher energy .",
    "these can be altered by two ingredients ( see again eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) )  : the transition matrix elements , and the ( kohn - sham ) transition energies @xmath9 , i.e.  the band - structure .",
    "the effect of pressure will be different for these two mechanisms .",
    "indeed , the increasing compression pushes the bands further apart , as seen in figure  [ fcch_ek ] , _ diminishing _ the polarization .",
    "the increased overlaps / hybridizations of orbitals , on the other hand , tend to make the polarization _ grow_. in order to separate the influence of the two contributions , we computed the partially screened coulomb interaction , @xmath0 , as a function of lattice spacing , albeit while keeping the band - structure fixed at the values obtained for the highest pressure , @xmath80 .",
    "thus the corresponding screened interaction will contain only the effect of changes in the bloch functions . as indicated by the symbols in the figure of the hubbard u , the latter decreases under compression , proving the above conjectured opposition in trend to the influence of the band - structure .",
    "this effect is surely very material specific . in systems with more electrons , where pressure will e.g.  cause the enhancement of bonding / anti - bonding splittings ,",
    "it can be expected that the changes in the band - structure often prevail such as to reduce the polarization under compression .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the influence of external pressure onto the construction of effective low energy many - body systems .",
    "using maximally localized wannier functions for a one - band tight binding model , we rationalized the counter - intuitive , yet prototypical behavior of the bare coulomb interaction , namely that its matrix elements augment upon compression , as a consequence of the delocalization of the wannier functions .",
    "this we understood to be caused by increased admixtures of non - orthogonal nearest neighbor tight - binding functions when the lattice spacing shrinks . as a more realistic system , we investigated fcc hydrogen under pressure , and constructed an effective model for the half - filled 1s orbital using maximally localized wannier functions . for the transfer integrals and the bare coulomb interaction , we witnessed the same tendencies as in the model case . yet",
    ", the hubbard @xmath0 , calculated as the on - site screened interaction within the constraint rpa technique , exhibited a non - monotonous trend under compression .",
    "this we traced back to a struggle between two opposing effects in the strength of screening .",
    "all these highlight the intricacy of mechanisms that influence effective models , and emphasizes the need for reliable _ ab initio",
