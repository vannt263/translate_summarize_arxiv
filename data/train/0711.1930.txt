    "one of the reasons for using a response surface analysis is to determine the operating conditions which , without loss of generality , maximize a response @xmath0 .",
    "development of confidence regions for these operating conditions has been considered by several investigators .",
    "the purpose of this report is to demonstrate that likelihood - based bootstrap confidence region methodology is a powerful alternative which does not suffer from some of the limitations associated with existing approaches .    over the experimental region",
    "it is assumed that the relationship of @xmath0 and the regressors @xmath1 can be expressed @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an unknown continuous , differentiable function and @xmath4 is a random source of variability not accounted for in @xmath3 . often @xmath5 can be adequately approximated with a second - order polynomial , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8    box and hunter ( 1954 ) constructed a confidence region for the stationary point of a second - order response surface .",
    "the stationary point is given by @xmath9 the solution to the system of equations @xmath10 .",
    "the interpretation and relevance of the stationary point depends on the nature of the response surface which is determined by @xmath11 .",
    "consider the following cases : 1 ) the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are mixed in sign , 2 ) the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are all positive and 3 ) the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are all negative .    in cases 1 and 2",
    "the stationary point is a saddle point and the location of minimum response , respectively , not the location of maximum response and , therefore , is not of interest for the purpose of this report . in case 3",
    "the stationary point is the location of maximum response . in practice ,",
    "the model parameters , including the elements of @xmath11 , are unknown but can be estimated from the data . since there is uncertainty associated with any estimator of @xmath11",
    "there is also uncertainty in assessing the nature of the true response surface and , therefore , the interpretation of box and hunter s confidence region .",
    "another issue of practical importance is the data are observed over a treatment space of finite dimensions , i.e.  the experimental region , and one is generally unwilling to extrapolate to areas outside this region .",
    "peterson ( 1992 ) utilized a transformation technique to develop a confidence region for the stationary point constrained to a specified region .",
    "however , as the approach is founded on the stationary point , the methodology suffers from the same interpretation difficulty as box and hunter s confidence region .    in cases 1 and 2",
    "the maximum response is undefined unless interest is restricted to a subset of the treatment space .",
    "ridge analysis was developed by hoerl ( 1959 ) and refined by draper ( 1963 ) to estimate the stationary point subject to the constraint @xmath12 . under their approach",
    "the investigator must specify a value of the lagrangian multiplier @xmath13 which , if chosen greater than the largest eigenvalue of @xmath14 , facilitates determination of the location of the predicted constrained maximum .",
    "stablein , carter and wampler ( 1983 ) constructed a confidence region for the constrained stationary point conditional on the investigator s choice of @xmath13 .",
    "however , proper interpretation of their confidence region depends on whether the choice of @xmath13 is greater than the largest eigenvalue of @xmath11 . since the eigenvalues of @xmath11",
    "can only be estimated , there is uncertainty involved in the confidence region s interpretation .",
    "let @xmath15 be the operating conditions associated with maximum @xmath5 subject to the constraint that @xmath16 is within the experimental region .",
    "denote @xmath17 and @xmath18 as estimators of @xmath15 and @xmath19 respectively , then in practice , @xmath17 can be calculated from @xmath20 using a numerical optimization algorithm , such as the nelder - mead ( 1965 ) simplex .",
    "a favorable property of @xmath15 is its interpretation does not depend on unknown model parameters , unlike the stationary point or constrained stationary point .",
    "a drawback , however , is that in some instances @xmath17 is not a consistent estimator . consider the case where @xmath5 is continuous and @xmath21 n@xmath22 .",
    "if the model is correct , @xmath18 is a least - squares estimator and @xmath15 is unique , then @xmath17 can be shown to be consistent ( kendall and stuart , 1979 , chapter 18 ) . to demonstrate an instance where @xmath15 is not unique and , therefore , @xmath17 is not consistent , consider the @xmath23 second - order response surface where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if the experimental region is the two dimensional direct product of the interval @xmath26 $ ] , i.e.  @xmath26 ^ 2 $ ] , then the maximum response within the experimental region occurs at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "a formal assessment of whether @xmath15 is unique could be made with tests of the appropriate hypotheses .",
    "for example , the likelihood of the symmetric model described earlier could be investigated by testing @xmath31 , @xmath32 . if there is insufficient evidence to reject @xmath33 further investigation is warranted .",
    "construction of a confidence region for @xmath15 using classical methods would require knowledge of the sampling distribution of @xmath17 .",
    "as this distribution is unknown it is reasonable to explore the use of bootstrap confidence region methods that do not require its mathematical derivation . unlike the confidence region methods described earlier",
    ", the bootstrap approach does not require normality assumptions on the model errors .",
    "hall ( 1987 , 1992 ) describes three methods for constructing likelihood - based bootstrap confidence regions for a @xmath34-variate parameter vector @xmath35 given a sample of size @xmath36 , namely , the percentile-@xmath37 method , the ordinary percentile ( hybrid ) method , and the percentile method . in regards to which of these methods is appropriate when @xmath38 , there are several factors that merit consideration .",
    "first , the percentile-@xmath37 method requires an accurate estimate for @xmath39 , the asymptotic covariance matrix of @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is assumed to be positive definite .",
    "the analytic expression for @xmath41 , an estimate of @xmath39 , is unknown and accurate estimates using resampling techniques are unlikely to obtain in the small sample designed experiment setting .",
    "second , and perhaps more importantly , only the percentile method preserves the range of @xmath35 in all cases . in",
    "particularly , for @xmath38 , only confidence regions under the percentile method are guaranteed to be bounded by the experimental region .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this report , attention is focused exclusively on the percentile method to construct likelihood - based bootstrap confidence regions for @xmath15 .",

    "3 .   compute @xmath46 bootstrap estimates of @xmath15 by following steps 3(a ) - 3(d ) a total of @xmath46 times ( see implementation notes for convenient choices of @xmath46 ) .",

    ".      steps @xmath57 are an application of bootstrapping residuals to generate bootstrap estimates of @xmath15 .",
    "bootstrapping residuals was proposed by efron ( 1979 ) and is considered appropriate when @xmath58 is fixed and the model is correct with exchangeable errors .",
    "standardization of the residual vector in step 2 ensures that the variance of each @xmath59 matches that of the unobservable @xmath60 .",
    "a simple bootstrap sample is generated by drawing a sample of size @xmath36 with replacement from the elements of @xmath47 .",
    "the balanced bootstrap , proposed by davison et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , was used in the examples and simulation studies of section [ simulation ] to ensure that @xmath61 . in step 4 the conditional distribution of @xmath17",
    "is approximated nonparametrically and used as the basis for selecting the confidence region boundary .    in practice ,",
    "the level contour on @xmath53 of smallest content that captures @xmath62 of the @xmath46 estimates @xmath52 was determined as follows : choose @xmath46 such that @xmath63 is a non - negative integer and assume that @xmath64 , @xmath55 ,  2 ,  ,  @xmath46 , are unique .",
    "let @xmath65 be the value of @xmath53 corresponding to the level contour of smallest content on @xmath66 that captures exactly @xmath63 of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 ,  2 , ",

    "consider that , by definition , @xmath67 for all @xmath68 captured by the contour and @xmath69 for every other @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 is the @xmath70 element of the set with elements @xmath64 , @xmath55 ,  2 ,  ,  @xmath46 , sorted in descending order . in the event that all @xmath64 , @xmath55 ,  2 ,  ,  @xmath46 , are not unique",
    ", the contour @xmath71 may capture more than @xmath63 of the @xmath68 , @xmath55 ,  2 , ",
    ",  @xmath46 , in which case the confidence region is conservative . after identifying @xmath65 in this manner",
    "the confidence region boundary was graphically displayed using the gcontour procedure of @xmath72 .",
    "likelihood - based confidence regions were constructed for @xmath15 , where @xmath5 was a second - order polynomial @xmath73 for the following cases : 1 ) concave down with @xmath15 located inside the experimental region and 2 ) saddle system with @xmath15 located , necessarily , on a boundary of the experimental region .",
    "the experimental region was defined as the two dimensional direct product of the interval @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "model parameters and coordinates of @xmath15 for both models are summarized in table [ ta : truemodels ] .    as indicated in section [ pmaa ] ,",
    "a nonparametric estimate of the sampling distribution of @xmath17 conditional on @xmath46 bootstrap estimates of @xmath15 serves as the basis for constructing the confidence region boundary .",
    "a product kernel density estimator for this purpose is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a univariate kernel and @xmath77 is the bandwidth for the @xmath78th coordinate ( see , e.g. , silverman , 1986 , scott , 1992 ) .",
    "gasser and mller ( 1979 ) showed that if @xmath76 is symmetric the bias of @xmath66 can be inflated near the boundaries .",
    "mller ( 1988 ) showed that uniform bias over the entire support of @xmath79 can be achieved if an asymmetric boundary corrected kernel is used in .",
    "gasser and mller ( 1979 ) and jones ( 1993 ) , among others , describe univariate boundary kernels designed for estimating densities with a single boundary .",
    "densities with support over an interval may be estimated using two such kernels , one at each boundary , but this is appropriate only if the bandwidth is small relative to the interval length .",
    "hart and wehrly s ( 1992 ) linear boundary kernel was implemented in , as this kernel is specifically designed to estimate densities with support on a interval , where the bandwidth need not be small relative the interval length .",
    "the biweight density was used as a basis for constructing this boundary kernel .",
    "two methods of multivariate bandwidth selection were explored : normal rule - of - thumb ( see , e.g. , scott , 1992 ) and the plug - in approach of wand and jones ( 1994 , pp 107 - 113 ) . the sample standard deviation in each coordinate of @xmath80 was used to estimate the scale of the conditional distribution of @xmath17 , as some measure of scale is required by both bandwidth selectors .",
    "the possibility exists for all bootstrap estimates for @xmath15 to be located on the experimental region boundary , a situation that occured almost exclusively with the saddle system . to ensure nonzero scale estimates ,",
    "the standard deviation for the @xmath78th coordinate was calculated from a modified dataset given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a random @xmath83 deviate .",
    "the effect of using the modified dataset to estimate standard deviation was negligible in the concave - down system , as most bootstrap estimates did not fall on a boundary . for the saddle system , using the modified dataset prevented nonzero bandwidth estimates and , thus , permitted use of the product kernel density estimator .",
    "it is of interest to compare the bootstrap confidence region performance under both methods of bandwidth selection , i.e.  normal rule - of - thumb and the plug - in approach .",
    "data for 500 experiments were simulated by adding a @xmath84 deviate to the ` true ' response at operating conditions associated with a @xmath23 rotatable central - composite design ( 5 center runs , @xmath85 ) .",
    "confidence regions using both bandwidth selectors were constructed using 2000 bootstrap samples in each simulated experiment .",
    "bandwidths under the plug - in method were slightly larger , on average , than those of the normal rule - of - thumb ( see table [ ta : bandwidths ] ) .",
    "this result is not unexpected , as simulation studies of wand and jones ( 1994 ) indicate a tendency for the multivariate plug - in method to oversmooth in some cases .",
    "a contour of the true concave - down response surface and a representative confidence region for @xmath15 with @xmath86 are provided in figures [ fi : true_concave_down_rs ] and [ fi : concave_down_cr ] , respectively .",
    "bootstrap estimates for @xmath15 are indicated with points in figure [ fi : concave_down_cr ] , with a solid line identifying the confidence region boundary .",
    "note that the confidence region boundary is within the experimental region , as required .",
    "had the hybrid or percentile-@xmath37 methods been implemented this would not have been true in all cases .",
    "the simulated experiments were arranged into five groups of 100 and the coverage probability calculated in each group for confidence coefficients ranging from @xmath87 .",
    "the mean coverage probability , with error bars placed at one standard error from the mean in either direction , is plotted in figure [ fi : concavedown_bw_comparison ] .",
    "note that there is little difference in coverage probability under the two approaches , a result expected from the close similarity in bandwidths seen in table [ ta : bandwidths ] .",
    "one approach for potentially improving the coverage probability is explored in the discussion section .",
    "a contour plot of the true saddle system and a representative confidence region for @xmath15 are provided in figures [ fi : true_saddle_system_rs ] and [ fi : saddle_system_cr ] , respectively .",
    "note that in this case @xmath15 is located on the boundary of the experimental region . since all bootstrap estimates for @xmath15 are also on the boundary , visual identification of the confidence region",
    "is difficult . in the figure , two small triangles",
    "identify the location of lower and upper boundaries in the @xmath88 coordinate . in the @xmath89 coordinate the confidence region extends slightly away from the experimental region boundary .",
    "figure [ fi : saddle_bw_comparison ] summarizes the coverage probability under both bandwidth selectors for the saddle system . as with the concave - down response surface ,",
    "the coverage probability is statistically indistinguishable under the two approaches .",
    "the coverage probability is closer to the nominal level than for the concave - down response surface .",
    "calculation of the normal rule - of - thumb bandwidths requires less time and computational resources than bandwidths under wand and jones plug - in method .",
    "since the coverage probability was essentially the same under both methods , the normal rule - of - thumb method was implemented in the simulation studies that follow .",
    "a simulation study was conducted to assess whether increasing the number of bootstrap samples would improve the coverage probability .",
    "confidence regions were constructed from the same simulated data described earlier using @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in neither the saddle system nor concave - down case was the coverage probability significantly effected by increasing @xmath46 .    to explore the effect of sample size on coverage probability , confidence regions for @xmath15 were constructed under both second - order response surfaces for @xmath85 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , corresponding to 1 , 2 and 16 experimental replications of a rotatable central - composite design with 5 center runs .",
    "the results for the concave - down and saddle system with @xmath86 are summarized in figures [ fi : concavedown_samplesize_comparison ] and [ fi : saddle_samplesize_comparison ] , respectively . in both cases",
    "the coverage probability approaches the nominal level with increasing sample size .",
    "existing confidence regions for operating conditions associated with the maximum of a response surface , either unconstrained or constrained to a specified region , are based on the stationary point .",
    "these approaches are only applicable to second - order models under the assumption of normally distributed errors .",
    "also , the interpretation of these confidence regions can be ambiguous , since this requires assessment of the unknown elements of the @xmath11 matrix .",
    "in contrast , the interpretation of a likelihood - based bootstrap confidence region for @xmath15 does not depend on the nature of the response surface , assuming @xmath15 is unique .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is a second - order polynomial the confidence region interpretation is the same whether @xmath5 is concave - down , concave - up or a saddle system .",
    "in addition , the approach is not restricted to second - order models nor does it require assumptions on the model error distribution , except for exchangeability of the errors . in principle , the methodology is also applicable to models where @xmath5 is nonlinear in @xmath19 , though hjorth ( 1994 , pp 190 ) indicates that in non - linear regression applications a direct analogue of standardized residuals is generally not available .",
    "simulation results from section [ simulation ] ( see figure [ fi : concavedown_samplesize_comparison ] ) indicate the bootstrap confidence region coverage probability was less than nominal under the concave - down system ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "coverage probability was higher for the saddle system ( @xmath85 ) , but still below the nominal level ( see figure [ fi : saddle_samplesize_comparison ] ) .",
    "a possible reason that higher coverage probability was observed for the saddle system is the estimated conditional distribution of @xmath17 is essentially restricted to one dimension in this case , thereby reducing the ` curse of dimensionality ' .",
    "evidence that the coverage probability in both systems converges to the nominal level with increasing sample size , an indication of the asymptotic accuracy of the methodology , is apparent in figures [ fi : concavedown_samplesize_comparison ] and [ fi : saddle_samplesize_comparison ] .",
    "loh ( 1987 , 1991 ) proposed a bootstrap calibration technique to improve the accuracy of confidence sets . in brief , the approach consists of estimating the confidence coefficient associated with the desired coverage probability .",
    "for example , to achieve a coverage probability of 90% in the concave - down response surface case ( @xmath85 ) , it is apparent in figure [ fi : concavedown_samplesize_comparison ] that a confidence coefficient of approximately 99.5% is required .",
    "it is also apparent that in this case realization of coverage probabilities greater than @xmath94 are not feasible with this approach , unless the sample size is increased .",
    "for the saddle system ( @xmath85 ) a confidence coefficient of approximately 95% is needed to achieve a coverage probability of 90% ( see figure [ fi : saddle_samplesize_comparison ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of bootstrap confidence regions for @xmath17 using the percentile method is largely determined by how accurately the conditional distribution of @xmath17 , @xmath95 , is estimated . under the kernel method implemented in section 2 , choice of bandwidth has a critical impact on this accuracy .",
    "hall ( 1987 ) indicated that bandwidths which are optimal in a global sense , such as minimization of the mean integrated squared error of @xmath53 , can produce confidence regions that are `` unduly bumpy '' .",
    "he noted that this can be attributed to the fact that the ratio of the variance to the squared bias of @xmath53 is greater in the tails than in the central region of the distribution .",
    "therefore , the normal rule - of - thumb and plug - in bandwidth selectors were investigated for their tendency to avoid undersmoothing .",
    "the @xmath23 concave - down and saddle system cases explored in section [ simulation ] are examples where these methods provide reasonable bandwidth estimates .",
    "jones ( 1993 ) followed a similar approach when he used a plug - in bandwidth selector in conjunction with a univariate boundary kernel .",
    "there are situations , however , in which bandwidth selection is more challenging .",
    "for example , if @xmath95 is bimodal , use of the standard deviation to estimate the scale of @xmath95 can result in considerable oversmoothing .",
    "janssen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) developed more robust scale estimators for such cases .",
    "consider , also , a situation where all bootstrap estimates for @xmath15 are equally distributed on the two boundaries @xmath96 and @xmath97 . on boundary @xmath98",
    "bandwidth @xmath99 should be much smaller than @xmath100 .",
    "however , on boundary @xmath101 the opposite is true . in this case , a variable kernel density estimator would seem more appropriate than the fixed bandwidth kernel estimator implemented in section [ simulation ] , as this would allow for different levels of smoothing depending on the location of bootstrap estimates for @xmath15 .",
    "application of the bootstrap confidence region methodology was restricted to the @xmath23 case where the experimental region was rectangular in shape .",
    "the bootstrap and kernel density estimation techniques described in section 2 are not limited to two dimensions .",
    "wand and jones plug - in bandwidth selector can also be extended to higher dimensions , though with greater computational expense . in light of the close comparison of coverage probability under the normal rule - of - thumb and plug - in methods observed in section [ simulation ]",
    ", rule - of - thumb methods may be adequate in many higher - dimensional applications .",
    "graphical presentation of confidence regions for @xmath102 is a challenging issue , though this is not unique to our application .",
    "staniswalis , messer and finston ( 1993 ) describe a multivariate boundary kernel designed for regions of arbitrary shape which obtains the correct order of bias over the entire region ( see , also , scott , 1992 , pp 155 ) .    throughout this article discussion",
    "has focused on maximizing a single response .",
    "however , researchers in many areas of application are faced with the problem of simultaneously improving multiple responses that depend on a common set of controllable variables . since",
    "a single operating condition is rarely optimal for all responses , compromise must be incorporated into the estimation procedure .",
    "desirability optimization methodology ( harrington , 1965 , derringer and suich , 1980 ) addresses this problem and has been proven effective in a wide range of applications involving continuous responses . in brief",
    ", the approach consists of estimating the operating conditions that maximize @xmath103 , a simultaneous measure of the desirability of all the responses .",
    "an arguable shortcoming of the methodology is it does not provide for estimation of the variability of these operating conditions .",
    "bootstrap confidence region methodology is defined in sufficiently general terms to allow for construction of a confidence region for the operating condition that maximizes @xmath103 constrained to the experimental region , under the assumption that this parameter is unique .    of practical interest",
    "is the computational resources and time required to construct a likelihood - based bootstrap confidence region .",
    "the programs that generated the results of section [ simulation ] were written in @xmath72 and run on a 300 megahertz @xmath104 ii desktop computer with 128 megabytes of ram .",
    "approximately 2 minutes is required to generate a single confidence region with @xmath86 , of which about 25 seconds are used for steps @xmath57 with the balance of the time taken in steps 4 and 5 . wand ( 1994 )",
    "describes methods of accelerating computations required for multivariate bandwidth optimization and kernel density estimation .",
    "these methods were not implemented due to technical limitations of @xmath72 .",
