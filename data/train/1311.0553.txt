    "in standard accretionary scenarios for growth of objects in the kuiper belt ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the objects all form in regions of the nebula with similar physical characteristics and so should be composed of roughly similar amounts of rock and ice .",
    "it was surprising , therefore , to find that measured densities of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) range from as low as 0.5 g @xmath1 to at least 2.6 g @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a clear trend has emerged : the smaller objects have low densities , while larger objects have increasingly higher densities . while larger objects often have higher densities due to pressure - induced phase changes , ice - rock bodies like these need to approach the size of triton before this effect becomes significant @xcite .",
    "a more likely culprit for the low densities of the small objects is porosity .",
    "nothing is known about the porosity of kbos , but in the asteroid belt the average porosity for objects as large as @xmath0350 km in diameter  the size of the small kbos  has been calculated to be @xmath050% @xcite , meaning that the compressed density of the object would be a factor of two higher than the measured density .",
    "ice and rock compression experiments show that rock is capable of supporting much more porosity @xcite , so we regard asteroid porosities as a plausible upper limit to the porosities of icy kbos . for this maximum porosity",
    ", the weighted average density for small kbos of 0.6 g @xmath1 corresponds to porosity - free density of @xmath0 1.2 g @xmath1 . even for a high assumed porosity ,",
    "these small kbos have only about one third rock by mass .",
    "simple coagulation of these rock - deficient objects will not lead to the much higher densities of the rock - rich dwarf planets .    with porosity the key unknown for small kbos , an important clue to the formation of the dense dwarf planets",
    "would be the measurement of the densities of the smallest kbos which are large enough to have had most of their porosity compressed out .",
    "here we report the detection and orbital characterization of a satellite to the @xmath0650 km diameter hot classical kbo 2002 ux25 .",
    "this object is an order of magnitude more massive than the next largest kbo with a measured density .",
    "we consider the effects of porosity on 2002 ux25 , and we use the density we calculate for this system to attempt to understand the formation mechanism of the dwarf planets .",
    "a satellite of 2002 ux25 was discovered in observations from the high resolution camera ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) on 26 august 2005 . in order to determine the orbit of the satellite and the mass of the system",
    ", we obtained a series of 6 follow up observations a year later . for each observation we obtained 8 exposures of 275 second duration using the f606w filter .    the satellite is cleanly detected in 4 observations , undetected in 2 observations , and detected but blended with the primary in 2 observations ( figure 1 ) .",
    "astrometric positions of the satellite relative to 2002 ux25 were obtained following the method of @xcite , in which a five - times oversampled theoretical point spread function ( psf ) is constructed for the pixel location of 2002 ux25 using tinytim @xcite , the hst psf modeling software , and then the sub - pixel centers of 2002 ux25 and the satellite , the total flux of 2002 ux25 and the satellite , and the sky background are optimized using an iterative least - squares fit .",
    "we determine the uncertainties for each observation from the scatter of the positions measured in the 8 individual images acquired within a single hst orbit .",
    "we often detect motion consistent with the satellite orbital velocity within single sets of observations . to be conservative , however",
    ", we assume that all deviation within one orbit is due only to measurement error . even in the most blended observation ,",
    "we obtain consistent measurements in all 8 of the individual images during a single visit .",
    "the astrometric positions of the satellite are given in table 1 .",
    "the hst astrometric observations lead to a mirror ambiguity in the determination of the orbit pole ( see below ) . for the 2002 ux25 system",
    ", breaking this ambiguity is particularly important ; one orbital configuration would be undergoing current mutual events , while the other had its mutual event season before the satellite discovery .",
    "a single well placed astrometric point several years later could break this ambiguity .",
    "we obtained a single astrometric point using laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs ao ) at the keck observatory @xcite on 7 december 2012 .",
    "observations were scheduled for a night when 2002 ux25 passed within 35 arcseconds of an @xmath3 star that could be used for tip - tilt correction .",
    "we obtained a total of 73 individual 2 minute integrations of the system using the nirc2 camera with a 0.02 arcsecond plate scale and the k@xmath4 filter .",
    "image full - width - half - max ( fwhm ) measured on 2002 ux25 ranged from 70 to 110 mas , worse than the 45 mas theoretical diffraction limit of a 10-meter telescope , but consistent with typical lgs ao performance with a moderate brightness off - axis tip - tilt star .",
    "the satellite was visible in the best single 2 minute exposures and easily visible in all medianed stacks of five exposures ( figure 1 ) . to accurately determine the astrometric position of the satellite we first selected the images with the best lgs ao correction .",
    "we determined the quality of the correction by fitting a single two - dimensional gaussian function at the position of the primary and calculating the average fwhm of the core .",
    "we then retained only the half of the data with a correction above the median value .",
    "these data were shifted to place the primary at a common position and then median - combined into 6 groups of 5 .",
    "while the satellite is outside of the core of the psf , it is within the halo , which could affect measurements of its position . to accurately measure the position",
    ", we fit the primary and satellite with a psf model that is the sum of two arbitrarily oriented two - dimensional gaussian distributions .",
    "the residuals from these fits at the location of the satellite are nearly indistinguishable from background noise , thus the astrometric fits to the satellite position will no longer be affected by the halo of the primary psf . as with the hst data",
    ", we determine the errors in the astrometric and photometric fits from the dispersion of the measures in the individual stacked frames ( table 1 ) .",
    "it appears that the 2002 ux25 satellite is close to being in an edge - on orbit ( figure 2 ) .",
    "such an orbit is consistent with the 2 non - detections of the satellite in the hst data .",
    "we determine the best - fit orbit to the observations by using a powell scheme to minimize the @xmath5 value of the residuals and find the optimal orbital parameters .",
    "we ignore the non - detections , and note that all good fits naturally place the non - detections too close to the primary to have been observed .",
    "our elliptical orbit has free parameters of semimajor axis , orbital period , inclination , longitude of the ascending node , mean anomaly , longitude of perihelion , and angle of nodes .",
    "the best fit has a @xmath6 value of 2.97 , or a reduced @xmath6 for 5 degrees of freedom ( 6 sets of @xmath7 , @xmath8 coordinates minus 7 orbital parameters ) of 0.6 , suggesting that the uncertainties have indeed been overestimated . forcing a fit to the mirror image orbit",
    ", we find a @xmath6 value of 12.0 , nearly four times higher than the best fit . as expected , the 2012 astrometry is the main discriminant between the two orbits .",
    "while the best fit orbit fits a position within 15 mas of the 2012 astrometric point , the mirror image orbit deviates by 92 mas , well outside of the uncertainty of the observation ( fig 2 ) .",
    "we conclude that we have resolved the mirror ambiguity and found the true orbital solution .",
    "the satellite plane crossed the line of sight to the earth and had mutual events in 2001 .",
    "the next mutual event season does not occur until 2109 .",
    "the best - fit orbit has a moderate eccentricity of 0.17 .",
    "attempting a circular fit gives a best - fit @xmath6 of 56.5 , or a reduced @xmath6 for 7 degrees of freedom of 8.1 , significantly higher than for the elliptical fit .",
    "we conclude that the orbit is indeed elliptical .",
    "we explore the uncertainties on the eccentricity and the other parameters by integrating through phase space using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) scheme .",
    "we use the python package _ emcee _",
    "@xcite which implements the @xcite affine invariant ensemble sampler for mcmc .",
    "we assign uniform priors on all parameters ( with two parameters being @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the eccentricity and @xmath12 is the argument of perihelion , rather than simply @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and find good convergence with an ensemble of 100 chains running 10@xmath13 steps with a initialization ( `` burn - in '' ) period , which is discarded , of 10% of the total length of each chain .",
    "the marginalized distribution of each of the parameters is nearly gaussian , we thus report the median and the middle 68.2% to represent the best fit plus 1@xmath14 uncertainties ( table 2 ) .",
    "we derive a marginalized system mass of @xmath15 kg , or about 0.7% the mass of eris , the most massive known object in the kuiper belt .",
    "thermal radiometry of 2002 ux25 and its satellite has been obtained from both the spitzer and herschel space telescopes . a combined analysis using measurements at wavelengths from 24 to 500 @xmath16",
    "m suggests an effective diameter of the system of 692@xmath1723 km with an albedo of 10.7@xmath18% .    as the fractional brightness of the satellite measured with hst at visible wavelengths is comparable to that measured with keck ao at infrared wavelengths ( table 2 ) , with a mean value of 8% , it is plausible that 2002 ux25 and its satellite share the same surface characteristics and thus the same albedo . in this case",
    "we can estimate their separate diameters by assuming that the total thermal emission from each is proportional to their surface areas .",
    "thus , the diameter of the primary would be @xmath0664 km while the satellite would be @xmath0190 km .",
    "alternatively , if the satellite is assumed to have a @xmath05% albedo typical of some smaller non - cold classical kbos , the sizes would be @xmath0640 and @xmath0260 km , respectively .",
    "assuming that the densities of the primary and satellite are identical , the densities for these two cases would be 0.79@xmath170.08 and 0.85@xmath170.08 g @xmath1 , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we will report the single average value with the full uncertainty range as 0.82@xmath170.11 g @xmath1 .",
    "2002 ux25 is the largest object in the kuiper belt with a measured density lower than 1 g @xmath1 .",
    "the eccentricity of 0.17@xmath170.03 appears unusual for such a large object with a close satellite . for the size of 2002 ux25 and its satellite ,",
    "we can estimate a time scale for damping of eccentricity by tides of the satellite of @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the satellite and primary masses , @xmath22 is the semimajor axis , @xmath23 is the radius of the satellite , @xmath24 is the tidal quality factor , @xmath25 is the orbital angular frequency , and @xmath26 is the effective rigidity of the satellite , defined as @xmath27 where @xmath16 is the material rigidity , @xmath28 is the satellite density , and @xmath29 is the satellite surface gravity @xcite .",
    "we find for 2002 ux25 an eccentricity damping time scale of @xmath30 gyr , comparable to the age of the solar system for these reasonably assumed values of @xmath16 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the moderate eccentricity of the satellite of 2002 ux25 , then , appears a reasonable outcome if the formation mechanism yielded an initially eccentric orbit or if eccentricity excitation ever occurred in the past .",
    "we construct the size - density relationship for all objects with measured masses and sizes ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we assume equal albedos and densities for all of the bodies in the system and derive the diameter and density of the primary object from the system mass and the measured effective diameter .",
    "system masses are taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , while effective diameters are from @xcite , , , , and , with the combined spitzer - herschel results being used whenever available . for orcus we derive densities for both the case where the albedos of the primary and satellite are assumed to be 23% and for the case where the satellite has a more typical lower albedo of 5% , leading to a higher density for the system .    the low density of 2002 ux25 places strong constraints on any hypothesis proposed for the cause of the kbo size - density relationship .",
    "objects of this size in the asteroid belt have porosities of @xmath020% and lower @xcite in the kuiper belt , porosities of objects this size should be lower ; ice is more compressible at higher pressure @xcite , and _ much _ more compressible if the internal temperatures are elevated .",
    "models of the internal structure of kbos of this size range usually conclude that enough internal heating has occurred from radioactivity and accretional heating that liquid water is present at some point in the history of the object ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "bulk porosities , in that case , will be low .    while true porosities of cold icy large objects remain unmeasured , the analogies to stronger asteroids , the laboratory experiments , and the internal modeling all suggest that 2002 ux25 should not support significant bulk porosity . assuming an upper limit of 20% for the porosity",
    "gives a compressed density of 2002 ux25 of close to 1 g @xmath1 .",
    "unless we have severely underestimated the porosity for this object , the rock fraction of 2002 ux25 is similar to the low rock fraction of the smaller kbos .",
    "the inferred low rock fraction of the 2002 ux25 system makes the formation of rock rich larger objects difficult to explain in any standard coagulation scenario .",
    "for example , to create an object with the volume of eris would require assembling @xmath040 objects of the size of 2002 ux25 . yet",
    "the assembled object , even with the additional compression , would still have a density close to 1 g @xmath1 rather than the 2.5 g @xmath1 density of eris @xcite .",
    "we offer a small number of possible ways in which the dwarf planets could still be created from the coagulation of smaller kbos .",
    "first , it is possible that we have severely underestimated porosities .",
    "if 2002 ux25 could support a porosity of 50% , it would have a compressed density similar to that of orcus or charon .",
    "if the smaller objects have porosities of 60% or higher , they too would have a similar rock fraction to the smaller dwarf planets and coagulation would no longer present difficulties .",
    "the inferred change porosity from 2002 ux25 to salacia to orcus , over a relatively small range in diameter , would be unexpected .",
    "while such an extreme porosity for 2002 ux25 can not be excluded , asteroid observations , internal modeling , and laboratory compression experiments all suggest that this possibility is unlikely .",
    "the second manner in which dwarf planets could be built from small bodies is if the objects for which we have measured densities are not a fair sample of the kuiper belt .",
    " but not all  of the low density objects are part of the cold classical kuiper belt , which is known to have many distinct physical properties , including a larger fraction of satellites and thus a tendency to have a measured density @xcite .",
    "the objects typhon and ceto are both centaurs , however , which are unlikely to be escapees from the stable cold classical region .",
    "the object 1998 sm165 is currently in a 2:1 resonance with neptune , so its initial origin is more ambiguous .",
    "2002 ux25 , however , with an inclination of 19 degrees appears to be a clear member of the hot classical population .",
    "it is thus clear that low density small objects exist in the non - cold classical population of the kuiper belt .",
    "another possibility is that there is a bias in our density measurements .",
    "if , for example , there were a significant population of higher density small objects with no density measurements , the large objects could easily be made .",
    "density measurement requires the presence of a satellite .",
    "it is not impossible to imagine that perhaps less dense objects preferentially acquire satellites , but such a scenario seems contrived .",
    "similarly , 2002 ux25 could be an outlier and not representative of the densities of the mid - sized kbos .",
    "more density measurements in this size range are clearly warranted .",
    "finally , it is possible that objects of the dwarf planet size evolve to their high densities through the effects of giant impacts .",
    "indeed , haumea is thought to have lost much of its icy mantle , clearly leading to an increase in density @xcite , but giant impact modeling has not found a way to lose sufficient ice to affect the density enough to explain more than a small amount of the higher densities of the dwarf planets @xcite .",
    "none of these alternatives appears likely .",
    "we are left in the uncomfortable state of having no satisfying mechanism to explain the formation of the icy dwarf planets .",
    "while objects up to the size of 2002 ux25 can easily be formed through standard coagulation scenarios , the rock rich larger bodies may require a formation mechanism separate from the rest of the kuiper belt .",
