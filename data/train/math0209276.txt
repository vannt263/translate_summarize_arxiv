    "in this note we present two injective proofs of a strengthening of a conjecture of simion  @xcite . to describe the result ,",
    "let @xmath0 be the ferrers diagram of a partition viewed as a set of squares in english notation .",
    "( see any of the texts  @xcite for definitions of terms that we do not define here . ) the shape @xmath1 will be fixed for the rest of this paper .",
    "consider a grid with the vertices labeled @xmath2 for @xmath3 as in figure  [ rgrid ] .",
    "place @xmath1 in the northwest corner of this array so that its squares coincide with those of the grid .",
    "a _ northeastern lattice path _ is a lattice path on the grid in which each step goes one unit to the north or one unit to the east . let @xmath4 be the number of northeastern lattice paths from @xmath5 to @xmath6 that _ do not go inside @xmath1 _ ( although they may touch its boundary ) , and let @xmath7 be the set of such paths . in particular , @xmath8 if either the starting or ending point is inside @xmath1 .",
    "simion  @xcite conjectured that for all @xmath9 the sequence @xmath10 is unimodal .",
    "lattice path techniques for proving unimodality were investigated by sagan  @xcite , but the conjecture remained open at that point .",
    "recently , hildebrand  @xcite proved the stronger result that this sequence is actually log concave by mostly algebraic means . shortly thereafter , wang  @xcite simplified hildebrand s proof using results about polya frequency sequences . in the present work , we will give two injective proofs of the stong version of simion s conjecture .",
    "the one in sections  [ seceasy ] and  [ sechard ] employs ideas from hildebrand s proof while the one in section  [ direct ] is more direct .",
    "our injections come from a method of lindstrm  @xcite , later popularized by gessel and viennot  @xcite , that can be used to prove total positivity results for matrices . for an exposition ,",
    "see sagan s book  @xcite .",
    "bna  @xcite has used related ideas to prove the log concavity of a sequence counting @xmath11-stack sortable permutations .",
    "we end this section by reiterating the statement of the main theorem for easy reference .",
    "notice that when @xmath12 it specializes to the well - known result that the rows of pascal s triangle are log concave .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath1 be the ferrers diagram of a partition and let @xmath4 be the number of northeastern lattice paths in the grid from @xmath5 to @xmath6 which do not intersect the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "then for all @xmath9 the sequence @xmath10 is log concave .",
    "this preliminary part of the first proof is from  @xcite . we include it so that our exposition will be self contained .",
    "we need to prove that for all @xmath13 we have @xmath14 to prove this , it suffices to show that @xmath15 because then , by symmetry , we also have @xmath16 now multiplying the last two equations together and simplifying gives the first .",
    "the second inequality can be proved by demonstrating another pair of equations , namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 multiplying these two equations together and cancelling gives the desired result .",
    "in this section we prove that ( [ easy ] ) holds by constructing an injection @xmath19    consider a path pair @xmath20 . then @xmath21 and @xmath22 must intersect .",
    "let @xmath23 be their first ( most southwestern ) intersection point .",
    "say that @xmath23 splits @xmath21 into parts @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and splits @xmath22 into parts @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "then the concatenation of @xmath24 and @xmath27 is a path in @xmath7 , and the concatenation of @xmath26 and @xmath25 is a path in @xmath28 .",
    "so define @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to see that the image of @xmath30 is exactly all @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 intersect .",
    "it is also simple to verify that if @xmath34 , then applying the same algorithm to @xmath35 recovers @xmath36 .",
    "so @xmath30 is injective .",
    "see figure [ easyf ] for an example .",
    "in this section we construct an injection @xmath37 thus proving  ( [ hard ] ) .",
    "let @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are vertices of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , with the same first coordinate , define the _ vertical distance from @xmath21 to @xmath22 at @xmath41 and @xmath42 _ to be @xmath43 .",
    "the vertical distance from @xmath21 to @xmath22 starts at 2 for their initial vertices and ends at 0 for their final ones .",
    "since vertical distance can change by at most one with a step of a path , there must be some vertical distance equal to 1 .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the first ( most southwest ) pair of points with vertical distance one .",
    "it follows from our choice of vertices that @xmath21 must enter @xmath41 with an east step and @xmath22 must enter @xmath42 with a north step .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be the portions of @xmath21 before and after @xmath41 , respectively , and similarly for @xmath22 .",
    "now let @xmath44 where @xmath45 is @xmath24 moved south one unit and @xmath46 is @xmath26 moved north one unit . since @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the first pair of points at vertical distance one , @xmath46 will not intersect @xmath47 and the concatenations are valid paths in @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the image of @xmath49 is exactly all path pairs @xmath50 that have a pair of points at vertical distance -1 .",
    "applying the same procedure to the first such pair inverts the map and so @xmath49 is injective .",
    "see figure [ newphi ] for an example .",
    "this completes the first proof of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "the reader may wonder if we can do away with splitting our problem into two parts , that is , equations ( [ easy ] ) and ( [ hard ] ) .",
    "the answer is yes , and the necessary injection is just a modification @xmath51 of the map @xmath49 .",
    "this will give us a second , completely combinatorial , proof of our main theorem    take a path pair @xmath52 .",
    "notice that @xmath21 and @xmath22 must intersect .",
    "so before the first intersection there must be a first pair of points @xmath53 ( on @xmath54 respectively ) at vertical distance 1 .",
    "similarly , after the last intersection there must be a last pair of points @xmath55 at horizontal distance 1 , where horizontal distance is defined analogously .",
    "let @xmath41 and @xmath56 divide @xmath21 into subpaths @xmath57 and use the same notation for @xmath22 . then define @xmath58 where @xmath45 is @xmath24 moved south one unit , @xmath59 is @xmath60 moved west one unit , and @xmath61 are defined in the analogous way but moving in the opposite directions .",
    "it is a simple job to verify that @xmath51 is well - defined and injective just as we did with @xmath49 .",
    "we have two final remarks .",
    "first of all , it is clear from the geometry of the situation that if @xmath47 is self - conjugate then the sequence in theorem  [ main ] is also symmetric , but this does not hold in general .",
    "one might also wonder if this sequence has the stronger property that the associated polynomial generating function has only real zeros .",
    "this is not always true as can be seen by taking @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the associated polynomial is @xmath64 which has two complex roots .",
    "it might be interesting to determine for which shapes the real zero property holds ."
