    "entanglement usually arises from quantum correlations between separated subsystems that can not be created by local actions on each subsystem .",

    "usually needs to find the entanglement properties and a way to control it , therefore the study of the dynamic properties of entanglement is useful for processing quantum information . + in the last years there has been an intensive research in the field of quantum communication that has yielded a variety of methods to distribute bipartite entanglement  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to the lack of a complete understanding of mixed state entanglement and multi - partite entanglement , it is not always clear what is the optimal way to distribute entanglement among distant parties . + a great effort has been devoted to the generation of atomic entanglement and entanglement between cavity modes through atom - photon interactions  @xcite and some notable experimental demonstrations have also been performed , for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . of particular interest is the generation of entangled states in two - atom systems , since they can represent two qubits , the building blocks of the quantum gates that are essential to implement quantum protocols in quantum information processing .",
    "+ a number of studies have shown that entanglement can be created between two objects that do not interact directly with each other , but interact with a common field , heat bath or thermal cavity field  @xcite .",
    "the formation of atom - photon entanglement and the subsequent generation of correlations between spatially separated atoms have been shown using the micromaser   @xcite .",
    "+ the micromaser  @xcite is appreciated as a practical device for processing information .",
    "it stores radiation for times significantly longer than the duration of the interaction with any single atom  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of an atom with the intracavity field of a micromaser will leave the atom - field system in an entangled state .",
    "the long cavity lifetime implies that the memory of this entanglement can influence the interaction with subsequent atoms and nonlocal correlations between these successive atoms can be induced leading to a violation of bell s inequality  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the successive atoms can interact with the field left by earlier atoms , in this manner gain can be seen with the most diffuse of gain media containing , on average , less than one atom at any given moment  @xcite and the dynamics of an atom inside the cavity will modify the evolution of the later atoms  @xcite .",
    "+ for a field that is interacting with more than one atom at a time , the atom - field entanglement was investigated  @xcite . in this scheme",
    "@xcite , an atom of fixed position situated at a peak of the cavity field becomes entangled with a second atom , at a variable distance away from the first atom , via their mutual cavity field with which they interact .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement between a pair of atoms pumped at the same time through a micromaser has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    "it is rather difficult to realize such a setup though .",
    "the genuine one - atom micromaser , on the other hand , can be operated over a reasonably large region of parameter space , and is thus a feasible device  @xcite for generating entanglement between two or more atoms .",
    "+ it has become well known that the degree of quantum entanglement depends crucially on the physical nature of the interacting objects and the character of their mutual coupling .",
    "it has been noticed that the above investigations involved mostly the absorption or emission of a single photon in an atomic transition . however , involvement of more than one photon , in particular , two photons in the transition between two atomic levels has been known for a long time  @xcite .",
    "the output radiation from such interactions exhibits nonclassical properties such as strong sub - poissonian photon statistics as well as fields with increased photon number  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , the idea of squeezed light has originated from two - photon process  @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to study the properties of two - atom entanglement in the framework of a two - photon process .",
    "moreover , the two - photon process introduces a dynamic stark shift in the atomic transition which is related to the magnitude of the electric field of the radiation inside the cavity .",
    "+ however , it should be noticed that all these results have been obtained for the case where the kerr medium and the stark shift are ignored .",
    "the kerr medium  @xcite can be modelled as an anharmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath0 .",
    "physically this model may be realized as if the cavity contains two different species of atoms , one of which behaves like a two - level atom and the other behaves like an anharmonic oscillator in the single - mode field of frequency @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "such a model is interesting by itself .",
    "the cavity mode is coupled to the kerr medium as well as to the two - level atoms .",
    "+ a kerr - like medium can be useful in many respects , such as detection of nonclassical states  @xcite , quantum nondemolition measurement  @xcite , investigation of quantum fluctuations  @xcite , generation of entangled macroscopic quantum states@xcite , and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "+ in a previous study  @xcite it has been shown that the entanglement between two qubits that do not interact directly with each other can be created for a very short time after the interaction is switched on .",
    "+ our purpose here is to demonstrate analytically the increase of the entanglement time created for two atoms ( qubits ) if the cavity field is filled with a nonlinear medium and a slight level shift is taken into consideration . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our model and the obtained wave function that controls the model in a general form at time @xmath1 . a brief discussion of the technique we are going to use to compute the entanglement ( concurrence ) of mixed quantum states is introduced in section iii .",
