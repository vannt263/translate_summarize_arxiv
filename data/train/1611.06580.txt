    "[ sec : intro ] convection is essential to heat transport in the cores of high mass stars , the envelopes of low mass stars , and the atmospheres of terrestrial and jovian planets .",
    "the convective dynamics in these astrophysical objects are influenced by atmospheric stratification , which is small in some systems ( e.g. massive star cores ) but spans about 14 density scale heights in the sun s convective envelope .",
    "understanding the fundamental properties of compressible convection in stratified media is essential to characterizing systems in astrophysics and planetary sciences .",
    "numerical constraints have often restricted studies of compressible convection to moderately high mach number ( ma ) , appropriate to regions near the sun s surface .",
    "few fundamental properties of low ma convection , which occurs in the deep solar interior , are known .",
    "early numerical experiments on stratified convection in two and three dimensions revealed a number of basic properties in the moderate - to - high ma regime . in the widely - studied rayleigh - bnard ( hereafter rb ) problem , upflows and downflows are symmetrical and the conductive flux approaches zero in the convective interior .",
    "these two hallmark characteristics of rb convection change significantly when stratification is included .",
    "stratified convection exhibits narrow downflow lanes and broad upflow regions .",
    "furthermore , the _ entropy _ gradient is negated by convection rather than the temperature gradient , and a significant conductive flux can exist in the presence of efficient convection .    in rb convection ,",
    "there exist two primary control parameters : the rayleigh number ( ra , the ratio of buoyant driving to diffusive damping ) and the prandtl number ( pr , the ratio of viscous to thermal diffusivity ) .",
    "these numbers coupled with the aspect ratio of the physical domain and the boundary conditions determine the dynamics of the convection .",
    "in stratified atmospheres , in addition to specifying the equation of state and fundamental properties of the gas , the two control parameters of rb convection are joined by the degree of stratification across the domain and the characteristic ma of the convective flows .",
    "polytropically stratified atmospheres , such as those used in early studies , are an ideal extension of rb convection into the stratified realm because the two additional control parameters are directly linked to basic properties of the atmosphere .",
    "the density stratification is set by the number of density scale heights ( @xmath0 ) the atmosphere spans , and ma is controlled by the superadiabatic excess ( @xmath9 ) , the deviation of the polytropic index from the adiabatic polytropic index @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we study the behavior of convective heat transport , quantified by the nusselt number ( nu ) , in plane - parallel , two - dimensional , polytropically stratified atmospheres .",
    "we vary @xmath9 and ra while holding @xmath10 , pr , and the aspect ratio constant .",

    "results are described in section [ sec : results ] and their implications are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we exmine the simplest stratified extension of rb by studying a fluid composed of monatomic ideal gas particles with an adiabatic index of @xmath11 and whose equation of state is @xmath12 .",
    "this is consistent with the approach used in earlier work .",
    "the initial atmosphere is a plane - parallel polytrope in which the gravitational acceleration and conductive flux , @xmath13 , do not vary with depth . to achieve the latter condition ,",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constant . under these assumptions , satisfying hydrostatic equilibrium produces a stratification of @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the polytropic index .",
    "the adiabatic polytropic index is @xmath18 , and the superadiabatic excess is @xmath9 which sets the scale of the entropy gradient ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a significant advance of this work is the ability to study large and small values of @xmath9 , as will be discussed .",
    "thermodynamic variables are nondimensionalized at the top of the atmosphere as @xmath20 , requiring @xmath21 and @xmath22 . by this choice ,",

    ", we use buoyancy time units and choose @xmath29 such that the initial density varies by a factor of 20 . all atmospheres studied here",
    "have an aspect ratio of 4 , such that @xmath30 .",
    "the atmospheric diffusivities are primarily controlled by the non - dimensional rayleigh number , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the entropy difference between the top and bottom boundaries , @xmath33 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath34 is the kinematic viscosity ( the viscous diffusivity ) , and @xmath35 is the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the relationship between the thermal and viscous diffusivities is set by the prandtl number , @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamic viscosity , @xmath37 , and the thermal conductivity , @xmath14 , relate to their corresponding diffusivities such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
