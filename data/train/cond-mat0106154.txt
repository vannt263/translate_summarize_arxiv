    "the critical behavior of random spin systems have been studied for more than decades @xcite .",
    "the effect of randomness has been attracting much attention because real materials contain impurities . in a pioneering work ,",
    "harris @xcite studied the problem whether the randomness changes the critical behavior of the pure system in the case of quenched random systems . the so - called harris criterion @xcite states that even a weak randomness changes the critical behavior if the specific heat exponent @xmath4 of the pure system is positive ; the random system belongs to the different universality class from that of the pure system .",
    "then , the randomness becomes relevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) terminology ; the critical behavior is controlled by the random fixed point .",
    "earlier works on random ising models @xcite deserve to be mentioned .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model is a marginal case .",
    "the specific heat diverges logarithmically at the critical point , that is , @xmath5 .",
    "we can not tell whether the randomness is relevant or not from the harris criterion . using the quantum - field theory , dotsenko and",
    "dotsenko @xcite calculated the correlation length of the 2d diluted ising system .",
    "they showed that the randomness is irrelevant but there appear logarithmic corrections .",
    "the expression for the correlation length in the weak - dilution region is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the strength of randomness .",
    "shalaev , shankar , and ludwig @xcite proceeded with the calculation of magnetization , @xmath8 which also shows the logarithmic corrections to the pure ising model without any change in critical exponents .",
    "the crossover is an interesting subject especially for random spin systems .",
    "the critical behavior is controlled by a relevant fixed point .",
    "however , it is influenced by irrelevant fixed points .",
    "thus , as the system size becomes large , we observe the crossover behavior at the critical region between the relevant fixed point and irrelevant fixed points . in the case of diluted spin models ,",
    "the magnetic order disappears at the percolation threshold even at @xmath9 .",
    "then , the crossover between the pure fixed point , the random fixed point ( if there exists ) , and the percolation fixed point is the subject of concern @xcite .",
    "the problem of self - averaging is also of current interest for random spin systems @xcite because each sample has a different random configuration .",
    "the system is said to exhibit self - averaging if the relative variance of the thermal average of a quantity goes to zero as the system size becomes infinite . using the rg , aharony and harris ( ah )",
    "@xcite discussed the @xmath1 dependence of the relative cumulants of singular quantities , where @xmath1 is the linear system size ; they discussed the self - averaging property of the random system , which depends on whether the randomness is relevant or not .",
    "the monte carlo simulation is a powerful tool to study difficult problems such as random spin systems .",
    "however , the simulation method sometimes suffers from the problems of slow dynamics .",
    "several new algorithms for the monte carlo simulation have been proposed to overcome such difficulties .",
    "cluster algorithms @xcite are examples of such efforts .",
    "the histogram method @xcite enables us to calculate physical quantities for different parameters with a single simulation by using the reweighting technique .",
    "quite recently the present authors have proposed a new effective cluster algorithm , which is called the probability - changing cluster ( pcc ) algorithm @xcite , of tuning the critical point automatically .",
    "the invaded cluster algorithm @xcite was also proposed to determine the critical point automatically , but its ensemble is not necessarily clear .",
    "in contrast , with the pcc algorithm we approach the canonical ensemble asymptotically ; we can use the finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis for physical quantities near the critical point .",
    "the pcc algorithm is quite useful for studying the random spin systems , where the distribution of the critical temperature , @xmath10 , due to the randomness is important , because we can tune the critical point of each random sample automatically .",
    "wiseman and domany @xcite pointed out the importance of determining the sample - dependent @xmath0 in the simulational study of random spin systems .",
    "they applied a reweighting technique to search critical points of random samples , but the iteration process was needed and there was a difficulty in tuning @xmath0 for some exceptional samples .",
    "the importance of the random average _",
    "after _ finding the critical point of each sample was also pointed out by bernardet _",
    "_ @xcite .    in this paper , we study the 2d site - diluted ising model using the pcc algorithm .",

    "the 2d site - diluted ising model was already studied by the monte carlo methods @xcite , and the 2d random - bond ising model was investigated by the monte carlo simulations @xcite , the transfer - matrix calculation @xcite , and the high - temperature expansion @xcite . in the present study we give special attention to the distribution of physical quantities using the pcc algorithm .    here",
    "we briefly describe the idea of the pcc algorithm @xcite .",
