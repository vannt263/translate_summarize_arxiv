    "a critical feature of the major upgrade of the cdf experiment  @xcite at fermilab is its inner silicon trackers .",
    "these detectors provide the ability to reconstruct and trigger on clusters of charged tracks originating @xmath0 to @xmath1  @xmath2 m away from the primary interaction .",
    "such detached vertices of charged particles , which may indicate the presence of a particle containing a @xmath3 quark , are critical to the cdf physics goals : characterization of top quark production and decay ; measurements of heavy flavor mixing ; cp violation and rare particle decays ; searches for supersymmetric particles and , eventually , searches for the higgs boson .",
    "however , the ability to resolve the separation between the detached vertex and primary interaction requires that the silicon trackers remain stable to approximately @xmath4  @xmath2 m .",
    "while detector alignment can be accomplished with tracks taken over a long integration time , the rasnik technique ( relative alignment system of the nikhef institute )  @xcite offers a low - cost tool to observe motion on the time scale of seconds with sensitivity better than one micron .",
    "rasnik systems are being developed for the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments which are currently being installed at the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "these systems have already been installed in a running experiment ",
    "the chorus experiment at cern used rasniks  @xcite to monitor the alignment of detectors used to track particles back into a photographic emulsion .    in section  [ design ]",
    "we describe the rasnik principle and the modifications we made to specifically adapt it to cdf s silicon inner tracker . in sections  [ implementation ] and  [ data ] we describe the specific implementation at cdf and discuss the data . in section  [ improvements ]",
    "we discuss possible improvements to the system .",
    "the original rasnik principle is based on projecting the image of a finely detailed mask through a lens onto a small digital camera , as shown in figure  [ rasprinc]a .",
    "the three components ( mask , lens , camera ) are mounted on separate detector subsystems and/or support structures . if any one of these three elements moves there will be a corresponding movement of the projected image on the camera . in this fashion",
    ", the system tracks the relative alignment of the pieces . a typical mask in such a system is a grid of black and white squares of order 100  @xmath2 m size , photo - etched onto a thin quartz slide . as shown in figure  [ mask ] , deviations from a perfect grid are coded into the pattern to remove large scale position ambiguities ; it is therefore called a `` coded mask '' .",
    "the use of such a pattern provides great statistical power since there are hundreds of black / white transitions to measure in a given image .    for our application on the cdf trackers we removed one movement ambiguity by integrating the light source , coded mask and lens into a single `` projector '' piece .",
    "the asymmetry of the technique introduces magnification , so new masks using smaller ( @xmath5  @xmath2 m squares were printed .",
    "the resultant two - element system is compared to the original three - element technique in figure  [ rasprinc]b .",
    "because the mask is coded , at least 10 squares ( contiguously in both horizontal and vertical directions ) must be visible to the camera in order to reconstruct the global position .",
    "since the magnification changes for different projector - camera distances , `` baselines '' , we provided the projector with several slots for positioning the coded mask . hence the magnification can be kept roughly constant , independent of the particular baseline , by a small change in the placement of the coded mask . providing multiple locations for the mask",
    "also eliminates the need for a diffuser , allowing the use of a single led and further reducing the power consumption and mass of the piece .",
    "since the depth of focus is typically of order 1  mm , the lens is mounted in a threaded barrel so that final focus can be achieved after both the projector and camera are glued in place .",
    "figure  [ rasphoto ] shows a photograph of the actual projector and camera pieces used in cdf .    because the elements are placed so close to the beamline they have to be low - mass and radiation - hard .",
    "the projector piece is made of thin polycarbonate , which provides ample rigidity for components of this small size .",
    "a projector _ in situ _",
    "( with mask , lens , and led installed ) weighs approximately 20 grams . a typical particle trajectory which traverses the piece corresponds to approximately 1% of a radiation length .",
    "various optical materials were tested in the uc davis cyclotron , exposing them to @xmath6200  krad using a 63  mev proton beam  @xcite .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the maximum integrated dose expected for an inner ( svx ) rasnik over the course of cdf s run iia . as a result of these tests we determined that a standard infrared led and bk7 glass lenses were adequately radiation hard , and used these components in all systems installed on the detectors .",
    "we replaced the ccd camera typically used in previous rasnik systems with a cmos - based camera .",
    "such cameras are smaller and are known to be more robust to radiation .",
    "still , we observed that the camera would suffer fatal damage at this dose , but only if it was powered on during the exposure .",
    "no visible damage was apparent if the camera was turned off .",
    "since the systems are read out one at a time , we energize each camera ( and led ) only when it is being used , and expect no significant radiation damage .",
    "this mode of operation corresponds to an approximate 5% duty cycle .",
    "after 1.5 years of running , including higher than expected beam losses , no visible effects of radiation damage have been observed on any system .",
    "the accuracy of the two - element system was tested by placing the projector on a moveable stage on an optical bench .",
    "figure  [ testing ] shows the actual vs. reconstructed position of the camera as it was moved horizontally .",
    "similar results were obtained for vertical movement .",
    "the figure also shows the residuals , which are unbiased with an rms of 0.4  @xmath2 m .",
    "such accuracy is at the limit of our ability to position the camera and probably does not indicate the limiting rasnik resolution .",
    "cdf s silicon system consists of three independent elements : a single layer mounted directly to the beampipe known as layer  00 , an inner tracker ( radii : @xmath7  cm ) known as the svx , and an outer tracker ( radii : @xmath8  cm ) known as the isl .",
    "the entire superstructure is connected at its ends to the inner wall of cdf s drift chamber ( central outer tracker , cot ) through piezoelectric positioners , called `` inchworms ''  @xcite .",
    "seventeen rasniks are strategically placed throughout the silicon tracker system so that movements of particular systems can be combined to determine the global twisting or translational motion of the silicon superstructure .",
    "the placement follows a three - fold azimuthal symmetry ( following that of the inchworms ) with mirror symmetry about the interaction point .",
    "a schematic diagram of the placement of the rasnik systems in cdf is shown in figure  [ placement ] .",
    "in addition to the 17 deployed rasniks , two systems ( one short and one long - baseline ) are installed as a control in the daq rackspace .",
    "these are mounted on 1/2-inch aluminum plates which are set on vibration damping material , so little relative motion is expected .",
    "the data - acquisition is controlled by a 600  mhz rack - mounted pc running linux , located in cdf s counting room .",
    "the data - taking proceeds rasnik - by - rasnik through a simple endless loop . for each rasnik ,",
    "the pc activates two relays corresponding to low - voltage power ( for both the led and camera ) and the output video signal .",
    "all signals are carried on @xmath6200 ft .",
    "lengths of shielded twisted pair cable ; no degradation of the video signal has been observed .",
    "care was taken to avoid ground loops .",
    "when the relay is closed the video signal is connected to a pci `` frame grabber '' card which takes the picture .",
    "the image is reconstructed in roughly a second , yielding transverse positions ( in the plane of the camera s image sensor ) , a rotation angle of the mask , and several quality - of - fit variables .",
    "in addition , a crude ( @xmath9 m ) measurement of the longitudinal distance between the camera and projector is obtained from the change in magnification of the image . in standard operating mode each rasnik s position is measured approximately every 120 seconds .",
    "the minimum time necessary to take a data point is limited by the camera : since the systems are normally unpowered to mitigate damage from radiation , a few seconds must be allowed upon power - up before the camera output signal becomes stable . for special running conditions , such as",
    "when the silicon detector position is being changed , a single rasnik s position can be read out every second .",
    "the readout system has proven highly reliable ; data - taking has proceeded without interruption for almost two years .",
    "the raw data is archived on disk , and plots of rasnik data from the current and previous month are available on a web page which is automatically updated every hour .",
    "the direct video output from the systems is also viewable in real - time on a monitor channel in the cdf control room .",
    "a very useful feature , which we plan to implement soon , would be to add a bit to the raw rasnik data which signifies whether physics data was being taken with the cdf detector .",
    "the existing plots on the web page will then display these periods in a different color , so that they will be easily recognizable at a glance .",
    "it is worth noting that the rasniks are quite adaptable , and can also be of use as a stand - alone setup , without collecting any data . in october 2000 ,",
    "the silicon detector mounted directly onto the beampipe ( layer  00 ) was inserted into the inner silicon tracker ( svx ) .",
    "this was a delicate process , with very little clearance margin .",
    "two rasniks were orthogonally mounted downstream of the insertion point , with cameras attached to the beampipe and projectors mounted close by on makeshift stands .",
    "the rasnik images were displayed continuously on two adjacent monitors , and provided an instantaneous visual cue to any incidental contact during the insertion .",
    "as described in the previous section , two rasniks were installed in the daq rackspace as a control .",
    "the data from one day of data - taking from one of these systems are shown in figure  [ rascontrol ] .",
    "the rms of the apparent relative motion is @xmath10  @xmath2 m ; data from the other control system were similar .",
    "each of the 19 rasnik systems takes data points in the two transverse ( @xmath11 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath12 ) directions every couple of minutes . in the following figures we show some representative features of the data taken thus far",
    "figure  [ quietday ] shows one day of motion recorded in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions for a quiet period , when cdf was taking data but no changes were made to any voltages or to the solenoid current .",
    "the data are shown for one each of the svx , svx@xmath15isl and isl@xmath15cot ( inchworm ) systems .",
    "the data reflect stability to @xmath16  @xmath2 m .",
    "this is a slightly higher variance than the control systems , but is within design tolerances for the cdf tracking detectors .",
    "a more typical day shows large motions , as shown in figure  [ typday ] .",
    "the @xmath17  @xmath2 m feature at 12:50 ( at 22.55 days ) corresponds exactly to a change in the current in cdf s 1.4  t solenoid .",
    "a view of an entire month is shown in figure  [ typmonth ] .",
    "many of the large motions due to energizing the solenoid etc .",
    "are visible .",
    "it is worth noting however that during data - taking periods with silicon included in the run , the entire system always returns towards its nominal position .",
    "the overall behavior thus far in cdf s run iia seems consistent with some settling of the detector subsystems : over the course of a month , some creep in the nominal position has sometimes occurred .",
    "this was more prevalent early on , and has tended to diminish with time . since the rasniks have shown that the silicon trackers are very stable during data - taking , the main long term use of the system will be to flag times when new global alignment periods should be defined .    when considering large motions recorded by some of the systems , it is important to recognize that changes in the angle of the projector piece with respect to the camera can be interpreted as large linear motions as the projected image sweeps across the camera . because of the placement of the systems at cdf , we can disentangle these effects by performing a global analysis of the motion of all the rasniks together .",
    "for example , when the cooling to the silicon detectors is switched on or off , a mechanical coupling between the beampipe and the inner svx / isl structural supports causes the svx and isl systems to record a linear relative translation which is approximately 10 times the actual movement . with the existing system ,",
    "this effect is discernible by a global analysis of the svx rasniks .",
    "the possibility of handling these types of effects on a single - rasnik basis is discussed in the next section .",
    "the greatest difficulty in interpreting the rasnik data from cdf was separating angular tilts of the projector piece ( which appear as large translations in the raw data ) from true non - rotational displacements .",
    "the same systems which were particularly susceptible to this effect also provided , when examined together , a way to determine whether there had in fact been a rotation of the projector piece(s ) .",
    "it would be nice , however , if there were a direct measure of this effect which did not rely on the readout of other systems .",
    "one possibility is that future systems might also deploy a small tilt meter on each rasnik projector , or on some select units .",
    "small tilt meters are commercially available with angular resolution of order 1  @xmath2radian .",
    "for the baselines we use , @xmath18  cm , such precision would allow corrections to micron precision .",
    "another improvement would be to employ a more advanced camera . during the last few years",
    ", the state of the art in microvideo image sensors has moved to digital output . instead of an ntsc output signal",
    ", a chip in the same size package is now available which has double the resolution and full digital output .",
    "the signal can be transmitted in parallel or clocked out on a single cable to a digital input board , removing the need for a frame grabber .",
    "such a pure digital system would also provide a raw data file with the information from each pixel uniquely identifiable .",
    "it may even be possible that one could use this information to gauge tilts of the projector by examining the ` squareness ' of a projected square from the coded mask .",
    "we have developed a modified rasnik system which is based on two , rather than three elements so that ambiguities in motion have been reduced .",
    "we have designed a projector system out of radiation - hard and low - mass components so that systems could be deployed in the inner tracker of the cdf detector .",
    "radiation damage to the installed rasniks has been successfully mitigated by operating the systems at a low duty cycle .",
    "the rasniks have found large motions due to the solenoid and powering of the silicon detectors that would otherwise have been unnoticed since no alignment data is taken during those periods .",
    "the rasniks have also shown that during data - taking periods the entire silicon tracking system is extraordinarily stable on the minutes to days time scale , giving us confidence that motions are not degrading cdf s reconstruction or triggering ability .",
    "the data - acquisition system has been robust , taking data continuously for almost two years with no downtime other than power outages .",
    "the rasniks have given cdf a minute - by - minute view of motions of its sensitive inner trackers that would otherwise have been unavailable .",

    "we thank brenna flaugher , joe incandela and rick snider for advice and support of the rasnik system within the silicon construction project .",
    "we thank frank chase for his engineering support during the design and construction of prototypes and production pieces .",
