    "<S> i will describe unruh s sonic analog of a black hole ( `` dumbhole '' ) that can be used to test hawking radiation , and some recent proposals on how one might be able to create a dumbhole in the lab . in this context </S>",

    "<S> cosmology is a unique science where observations of the current or recent universe are used to infer about the very early universe . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the physical ideas used to extrapolate back to the early universe are based on ideas that were developed in a non - cosmological setting . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly most of these ideas work extremely well . </S>",
    "<S> yet there are also ideas that have no experimental verification but are used on the basis of theoretical extrapolation . </S>",
    "<S> `` cosmology in the lab '' is an emerging research area to search for analogs of the cosmological environment to enable experimental tests of ideas in cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmological problems are of two types . </S>",
    "<S> the first type contains problems that are based on physics in which the cosmological environment is not crucial . </S>",
    "<S> it is just that the particular problem is more relevant to cosmology than to some terrestrial system . </S>",
    "<S> the outcomes of phase transitions fall into this class of problems . in cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> remnants of a phase transition , such as topological defects , are crucial since they could be observed today and lead to important clues about an earlier epoch .    </S>",
    "<S> problems of the second type are strongly based on the gravitational environment . </S>",
    "<S> for example , these could involve quantum effects in the presence of a `` horizon '' . in models of cosmic inflation , quantum field theoretic effects on scales larger than the cosmic horizon are supposed to have led to density fluctuations that then grew into galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , these quantum field theoretic effects are built upon the success quantum field theory ( qft ) has had on very small ( atomic ) scales . </S>",
    "<S> systems with horizons have not been constructed in the lab so far , and there are no experimental tests of qft on superhorizon scales . </S>",
    "<S> another system with a horizon is a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> particles within the black hole can not classically escape to the region outside the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum effects are supposed to modify this picture , leading to hawking radiation from the black hole  @xcite . it would be very desirable to find a way to experimentally test these ideas .    </S>",
    "<S> research on `` cosmology in the lab '' should be understood strictly as an attempt to simulate the cosmological environment in laboratory systems . </S>",
    "<S> it should not become an attempt to equate cosmological ( or gravitational ) phenomenon to some feature of a particular laboratory system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , cosmology in the lab can not say if there is an underlying atomistic structure to spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> however , if there was an atomistic theory of spacetime , condensed matter experiments might prove to be useful analogs . from my perspective , </S>",
    "<S> cosmology in the lab is similar to numerical studies of systems carried out on a computer . </S>",
    "<S> if the simulation is accurate , experiments can tell us things about cosmology that we would otherwise have no hope of finding out .    in 1981 </S>",
    "<S> unruh  @xcite proposed an experimental analog of a black hole . </S>",
    "<S> he considered a fluid that is flowing at subsonic speed in the upstream region and at supersonic speed in the downstream region ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> any fish in the downstream region can not send sound signals to the fish in the upstream region . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there is a sonic event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> classically , the fish upstream will receive no sound from the sonic hole _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the hole is `` dumb '' . with quantum effects taken into account , however , there will be hawking radiation of sound from the horizon of the dumbhole just as there is hawking radiation of light from a black hole .    to put unruh s dumbhole on a more quantitative footing </S>",
    "<S> , the fluid is assumed to obey the irrotational , inviscid , navier - stokes equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes an external potential ( _ e.g. _ gravitational potential ) . the pressure ( @xmath2 ) is assumed to be a function of the density ( @xmath3 ) alone . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations around some background flow will correspond to sound . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the background flow , @xmath6 @xmath7 then it can be shown that @xmath8 where the metric , @xmath9 , experienced by the sound is given by : @xmath10 this is the painlev - gullstrand - lematre form of a black hole metric if we assume a spherically symmetric , stationary , convergent , background flow . </S>",
    "<S> the horizon is at @xmath11 , that is , at the location where the fluid velocity equals the sound speed .    </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to include quantum field theoretic effects . for this </S>",
    "<S> we have to go back to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ waveeq ] ) , find the mode functions , and compare their behavior near the horizon to that in the asymptotic region . </S>",
    "<S> this is the usual hawking calculation and we will not show it here . </S>",
    "<S> we simply state unruh s result for the hawking temperature  @xcite : @xmath12        \\left [ \\frac{1 { \\rm mm}}{r } \\right ] \\label{unruhestimate}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the distance over which @xmath14 changes .    </S>",
    "<S> unruh s estimate highlights the difficulty of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we need to accelerate the fluid by @xmath15 m / s over a distance of @xmath16 mm to get a temperature of a mere @xmath17 k. in units of the acceleration due to gravity , the required fluid acceleration is @xmath18 @xmath19 ! achieving such an enormous acceleration is impractical given that we also want the fluid to remain very cold ( @xmath20k ) , so that we are able to detect the hawking radiation . </S>",
    "<S> there are all sorts of instabilities that set in under such extreme conditions for all known systems  @xcite .    what is the alternative ? </S>",
    "<S> a ray of hope emerges when one considers visser s generalization  @xcite of unruh s result . </S>",
    "<S> unruh in his pioneering contribution only considered a fluid in which the sound speed is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> visser generalized the setting to include the possibility that the sound speed may vary within the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> then he found : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sound speed and the derivative is evaluated at the location of the horizon ( @xmath23 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the ray of hope  @xcite is that we need not have huge gradients in @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> instead we might be able to arrange @xmath14 to vary very rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> an extreme case would be where @xmath25 everywhere but the properties of the fluid change at a boundary that is moving . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid is stationary with respect to the container but is moving with respect to the boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> this was also the underlying idea in a proposal made by jacobson and volovik  @xcite where they considered a moving texture or domain wall in @xmath26he . </S>",
    "<S> the sound speed within the wall is different from that outside . and </S>",
    "<S> the wall needs to be moved relatively slowly with respect to the container for there to be hawking radiation . </S>",
    "<S> one complication there is that the order parameter varies within the wall in such a way that there is also radiation due to other effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic experimental set - up seems very simple ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a tube with the fluid in one phase on one side and a second phase on the other side . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the sound speed in phase 2 is less than the sound speed in phase 1 : @xmath27 . if the phase boundary propagates from phase 2 into phase 1 at a speed @xmath24 such that @xmath28 , sound from within the phase 2 region can not enter the phase 1 region . </S>",
    "<S> alternately , in the rest frame of the boundary , the fluid is flowing with velocity @xmath24 toward the phase 2 side , and the unruh set - up is exactly duplicated . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary is the location of the sonic horizon . </S>",
    "<S> since the fluid is not moving with respect to the container , there wo nt be any instabilities due to surface effects . although , the phase boundary does move with respect to the container and one needs to worry if this will lead to instabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> the hawking temperature for the propagating phase boundary can be calculated in the rest frame of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> then the metric is of the painlev - gullstrand - lematre form ( eq .  ( [ metric ] ) ) and </S>",
    "<S> one can directly use the calculations in refs .   </S>",
    "<S> in which hawking radiation is viewed as the tunneling of ingoing particles from inside the black hole to outgoing particles on the outside . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this approach is that it is largely system independent . </S>",
    "<S> it does require , however , that the particles be massless both inside and outside the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> let us now outline this calculation following ref .  .    in both the exterior and interior regions of the sonic hole ( phases 1 and 2 in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) , the dispersion relation is assumed to be that for a massless fermionic particle . in the fluid rest frame : @xmath29 @xmath30 for convenience we will write these equations as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is @xmath33 in the exterior region and @xmath34 in the interior region . </S>",
    "<S> the transition in @xmath32 is assumed to be sharp compared to any other length scale of interest but @xmath32 is still assumed to be continuous .    as for any fermion </S>",
    "<S> , the dispersion relation has states with both negative and positive energy . </S>",
    "<S> the negative energy levels are all occupied and form the dirac sea .    if we work in the rest frame of the phase boundary , the fluid moves to the right with speed @xmath24 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> now the velocity of a quasiparticle , defined as @xmath35 , is shifted by the fluid velocity . </S>",
    "<S> so the dispersion relation becomes : @xmath36 the usual situation is when @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> then the filled levels ( dirac sea ) of both branches of the dispersion relation have negative energy . what happens if @xmath38 ? </S>",
    "<S> then one branch of the dirac sea in the interior region has positive energy as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is what makes it possible for particles of energy @xmath39 in the interior vacuum to emerge out of the dumbhole . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , it is the particles that have velocity directed to the right ( further into the interior of the dumbhole ) , that can tunnel out onto the branch for the left - moving particles in the exterior region and then escape out to the asymptotic region .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy is related to the momentum of the particle via @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the particle that is outgoing in the exterior region , therefore we choose the @xmath41 sign .    </S>",
    "<S> the hawking temperature is calculated by finding the tunneling rate , which can be obtained from the imaginary part of the action : @xmath42 the function @xmath43 has a zero at the location of the phase boundary ( @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so we need to go over to the complex plane , deform the contour of integration around the pole at the origin , and then evaluate the integral using the residue theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this gives : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the magnitude of the derivative of the sound speed at the location of the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the rate at which particles can tunnel to the exterior region is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hawking temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> then the formula for the hawking temperature is the same as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ unruhestimate ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hawking temperature is estimated to be : @xmath49 where , @xmath50 is the thickness of the phase boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath24 enters the estimate since it determines the location of the horizon at which gradient of @xmath51 is evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will assume that @xmath52 is ( roughly ) independent of @xmath24 as long as it satisfies @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> the hardest problem , of course , is to find an experimental realization of a dumbhole . </S>",
    "<S> since the hawking temperature is very low , the system must either be a fluid or a solid . </S>",
    "<S> only a few fluids are known at this temperature . </S>",
    "<S> solids may be used too if there is a suitable melting transition . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to use bose - einstein condensates that have been discussed in other related contexts in refs .  .    </S>",
    "<S> one particularly intriguing system is superfluid @xmath26he since the ab phase boundary has been studied quite extensively both experimentally and theoretically . indeed the ab interface has been made to oscillate by applying suitable magnetic fields , and the lancaster group has also measured the radiation from the oscillating phase boundary  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is essentially that shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , except that the container is vertical . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid is kept at 150 @xmath20k and 0 bar pressure . at such low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> there are few excitations present and the system is essentially in its vacuum state . a non - uniform magnetic field is applied along the vertical such that it is stronger in the lower part of the container than in the upper part . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the lower part to be in the a - phase and the upper part to be in the b - phase . </S>",
    "<S> the ab phase boundary is at the location where the magnetic field attains a critical value , @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> next , a small oscillating magnetic field is applied along the vertical so that the total magnetic field is : @xmath54 the location of the ab phase boundary in the absence of dissipation can be be found by setting @xmath55 . due to the oscillating component of the magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium location of the interface is time - dependent : @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of oscillation is given by : @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the gradient of @xmath58 is roughly constant in the region where the phase boundary oscillates . ) </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of oscillation of the phase boundary can be changed by changing the frequency , @xmath59 , of the applied oscillating field . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle radiation is detected by a vibrating wire resonator placed at the upper end of the container . </S>",
    "<S> the data for the radiated power versus oscillation frequency is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the experimental curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] are explained phenomenologically as follows . assuming a linear restoring force and dissipative motion , the equation of motion for @xmath60 , the position of the interface , is : @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is the equilibrium position of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath64 where @xmath65    therefore @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 is independent of @xmath69 for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the average power dissipated over an oscillation time period is @xmath71 and this grows quadratically with @xmath69 for @xmath72 and is constant for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the log - log plot of the data for @xmath74 hz in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] for the larger value of @xmath75 , and over the whole range of @xmath76 for the smaller value of @xmath75 provided we treat @xmath77 as a fitting parameter that depends on @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are three unexplained features of the data as discussed in ref .  .    1 .   theoretical estimates of @xmath77 are small by several orders of magnitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   for the smaller value of @xmath75 , the required value of @xmath77 is about 5 times smaller than what is needed to fit the data for larger @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath77 is calculated from the @xmath78 mt data , and used to predict the @xmath79 mt curve , one gets the lower solid curve shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] and this does not even come close to matching the data . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> the data clearly shows an unexpected increase in dissipation at frequencies @xmath80 hz when @xmath81 mt .    </S>",
    "<S> can hawking radiation play any role in the increased dissipation seen for @xmath80 hz when @xmath81 mt ? </S>",
    "<S> the data does seem to indicate a new source of dissipation at high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the interface at @xmath82 hz is about @xmath16 cm / s . </S>",
    "<S> this also happens to be close to the quasiparticle velocity in the a phase in the direction orthogonal to the interface ( @xmath83 cm / s for certain excitations as explained below ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also less than the quasiparticle velocity in the b phase ( @xmath84 m / s ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the power emitted in hawking radiation using the temperature in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ boundarytsh ] ) is of order @xmath16 pw and is in the range seen . hawking radiation </S>",
    "<S> is only expected during the part of the oscillation when the velocity of the interface lies in the suitable range : @xmath85 . as this duration increases , </S>",
    "<S> we expect the amount of hawking radiation to grow proportionally .    at @xmath82 hz in the experiment , the simple model for the motion of the interface must break down . </S>",
    "<S> this could happen in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> the restoring force might get non - linear corrections , or the dissipation parameter @xmath77 could get some velocity dependent corrections . purely for illustrative purposes , let us assume that the form of the velocity ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ velocity ] ) ) continues to hold even at large @xmath69 but with a different amplitude : @xmath86 the amplitude @xmath87 is assumed to be an @xmath69 independent parameter in the frequency range of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the exact form of @xmath24 is not crucial for us . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the power of @xmath69 in the amplitude could be different from 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now assume that hawking radiation at temperature @xmath52 ( eq .  ( [ boundarytsh ] ) ) is emitted when @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> then , for @xmath89 `` light '' species of radiation , this gives : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the fraction of time for which @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the formula holds only for radiation for which the mass is less than the hawking temperature . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath93 this is self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> ( if the hawking temperature is less than the mass of the particles , the radiation is exponentially suppressed . ) </S>",
    "<S> let us write @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the cell diameter ( @xmath97 mm in the experiment ) . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath98 is in the observed range if @xmath99  .    </S>",
    "<S> can we estimate the critical frequency @xmath100 ? </S>",
    "<S> in our illustrative model @xmath101 if @xmath102 then the values of @xmath100 are shown in the following table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly the values of @xmath100 , the critical value of the frequency at which hawking radiation starts , do not agree with data . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment shows anomalous radiation starting at some critical _ frequency _ , whereas hawking radiation would start at some critical _ velocity_. on the other hand , there is no reason to adopt @xmath103 except that this holds at low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the hawking radiation explanation can only work if @xmath87 is independent of @xmath104 at high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we will now see , the interpretation in terms of hawking radiation has additional theoretical issues .    </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty with the interpretation is that , in our earlier estimate , we have assumed that the sound quanta are massless on either side of the interface , whereas this is not true in the ab system . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticles on the a - phase side of the interface indeed have a linear dispersion relation very close to the nodal point . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the full dispersion relation in the rest frame of the fluid  @xcite : @xmath105^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 m / s is the fermi velocity and @xmath107 is the fermi momentum with @xmath108 , and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the transition temperature from normal to superfluid phase  @xcite . at zero pressure and strong magnetic field @xmath111 mk . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to check that @xmath112 vanishes if @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the dispersion relation has a node . </S>",
    "<S> now consider excitations near the node , @xmath114 , with @xmath115 and with momenta perpendicular to @xmath116 : @xmath117   vectors on the ab interface mostly lie in the plane of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> hence excitations that cross the interface necessarily have non - vanishing momenta perpendicular to @xmath116 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> for these excitations the dispersion relation is linear , @xmath118 with @xmath119 cm / s . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we can expect a dumbhole to form whenever the interface velocity exceeds @xmath120 cm / s .    on the b - phase side , </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation in the rest frame of the fluid is : @xmath121^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and the b - phase gap @xmath124 with @xmath125 mk at zero pressure and magnetic field . since @xmath39 only depends on @xmath126 and </S>",
    "<S> it does not vanish at @xmath127 , there is no node in the dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for @xmath128 we have : @xmath129^{1/2 } \\label{bdispersionlow}\\ ] ] where we also assume @xmath130 note that @xmath131 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the b - phase dispersion relation is not of the usual relativistic form @xmath132 , it is not possible to think of the quasiparticles as propagating on a metric with just the usual second derivative kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> however the black hole analogy need not break down ! there is still a sonic horizon from within which quasiparticles moving at 3 cm / s in the a - phase region can not escape . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important ingredient for a dumbhole ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present situation is more complicated though , because not all quasiparticles in the a - phase move at 3 cm / s . </S>",
    "<S> only the quasiparticles close to the nodal point have this velocity . </S>",
    "<S> so a negative energy particle that falls through the interface and into the a - phase region can not escape back to the b - phase region only if its velocity in the a - phase region is of order 3 cm / s .    </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relations given above are in the fluid rest frame . in the interface rest frame </S>",
    "<S> , the fluid is moving to the right with velocity @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> quasiparticle velocities in the interface rest frame will be shifted by @xmath133 with respect to the velocities in the fluid rest frame . since velocity is defined by @xmath35 , the dispersion relation in the interface rest frame </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by adding @xmath134 to the dispersion relation in the fluid rest frame . as before , part of the dirac sea on the a - phase side of the interface will emerge into the positive energy region . furthermore , the energy of some occupied states in the a - phase side is the same as that of unoccupied states in the b - phase side . </S>",
    "<S> so the basic set - up of the linear dispersion relation calculation given above is available . </S>",
    "<S> the technical difficulty is that the equation @xmath135 can not as simply be inverted to get @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> hence let us construct a toy model for the dispersion relation that captures some of the essential features of the full model .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the one - dimensional dispersion relation : @xmath137 where @xmath138 , @xmath139 in the b - phase region and @xmath140 , @xmath141 in the a - phase . </S>",
    "<S> we will take @xmath142 in the b - phase and @xmath143 in the a - phase , but also keep open the possibility that @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath32 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 only vary appreciably within the interface . </S>",
    "<S> this dispersion relation goes over to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ adispersionlow ] ) in the a - phase ( with @xmath147 ) and likewise eq .  ( [ bdispersionlow ] ) in the b - phase term and not due to the kinetic term as in the toy model . ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dispersion relation is written in the rest frame of the interface in which the fluid is moving to the right with speed @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> also , we are looking at the one dimensional problem where the momentum is only along the @xmath148 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> inverting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ toydispersion ] ) we get , @xmath149 where @xmath150 . the discriminant should be positive in the asymptotic regions for the particle to be physical ( and not `` under the barrier '' ) . this imposes a constraint on the velocity : @xmath151 in the a - phase region , @xmath141 , and the condition is trivially satisfied as seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inverted ] ) . in the b - phase </S>",
    "<S> , the condition reads : @xmath152 \\label{constraint}\\ ] ] hawking radiation can only occur if : @xmath153 or else if : @xmath154 we assume that the condition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ discriminant ] ) is satisfied everywhere , including within the interface . </S>",
    "<S> if this is not the case , the discussion will be more involved .    in the experiment , @xmath155 and </S>",
    "<S> so the square root factor is essentially 1 . therefore either @xmath156 or else @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we are interested in @xmath158 and since @xmath159 , we also have @xmath160 . so the thresholds for @xmath39 are both positive if @xmath161 ( but not if , for example , @xmath162 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first possibility is one that is expected since the minimum energy of quasiparticles in the b - phase is @xmath163 in the fluid rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the second possibility corresponds to the emergence of the dirac sea in the b - phase when viewed in the rest frame of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss both possibilities in some more detail .    at the large values of the energy required by the first possibility ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ first ] ) ) , our toy model starts becoming suspect and a more realistic calculation is called for . however , </S>",
    "<S> if we proceed with the toy model under the assumption that it still gives the correct qualitative behavior , we can calculate the hawking temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the action follows the linear case described earlier . </S>",
    "<S> there is a pole at @xmath164 and this gives the only contribution to the imaginary part of the action . </S>",
    "<S> however , the process requires a branch change . </S>",
    "<S> the particles on the a - phase side are on the branch with the @xmath41 sign in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ toydispersion ] ) while , after tunneling , the particles would end up on the branch on the b - phase side that has the @xmath165 sign . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis is required to determine if the branch change can take place .    </S>",
    "<S> now we discuss the second possibility ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ second ] ) ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the particle from the a - phase may tunnel to a state in the dirac sea of the b - phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tunneling can not take place since the corresponding state in the b - phase dirac sea is occupied . </S>",
    "<S> yet the process may still be important . </S>",
    "<S> suppose there is a vacuum fluctuation in the b - phase in which a particle from the dirac sea gets excited to the upper branch . </S>",
    "<S> normally the particle would fall back into the hole in the dirac sea within a time allowed by the uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present situation , a particle from the a - phase can tunnel into the b - phase and fill up the hole before the original particle has had a chance to fall back . </S>",
    "<S> then there is no hole left for the particle in the upper branch to return to and it must escape as a real particle ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this literally corresponds to the process shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] where vacuum fluctuations in the b - phase create a pair of positive and negative energy fermions and the negative energy particle falls into the dumbhole . </S>",
    "<S> so the second possibility given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ second ] ) might indeed be relevant .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the hawking temperature proceeds as before . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rate is calculated by finding the imaginary part of the action obtained by integrating @xmath166 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath165 sign in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inverted ] ) must be chosen for there to be a pole in @xmath166 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rate must be multiplied by the probability of having a hole of energy @xmath39 on the b - phase side . as long as this factor is not an exponential , </S>",
    "<S> the boltzmann factor will be given by the tunneling rate alone . </S>",
    "<S> since the structure of the pole is the same as in the linear calculation given above , the hawking temperature will still be @xmath167 in the interface rest frame . note that since the tunneling occurs between the branches with a @xmath41 sign in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ toydispersion ] ) , @xmath39 must lie in the range ( for @xmath168 ) : @xmath169 where we are assuming @xmath170 . therefore , in the fluid rest frame , the radiated particle can only have energy ( @xmath171 ) in the interval : @xmath172 this restriction on the range of energy of radiated particles will change if branch changing processes can occur </S>",
    "<S> . then one can imagine several other processes as well . these should be investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> the above discussion is based on a toy model of the ab system and suffers from the danger that it is inaccurate in some essential way . in particular , since the last term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ toydispersion ] ) comes from @xmath173 , and the component of @xmath174 along @xmath133 is taken to be small on the a - phase side , perhaps it would have been better to replace the term by @xmath175 . </S>",
    "<S> then , with @xmath168 and for small @xmath176 , the b - phase dirac sea would not emerge into the positive energy region and the only possibility for tunneling would be via branch changing processes .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly it is important to do a more thorough calculation and with a realistic model of the ab interface . </S>",
    "<S> such an effort would be aided by the early calculations on the dissipation from the ab interface  @xcite , the profile of the order parameter within the interface  @xcite , and the scattering of quasiparticles off the interface  @xcite . to connect with experiment , one would also need a handle on the interface motion at high frequencies and on other effects that could potentially explain the anomalous radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , from the perspective of studying hawking radiation , it would be desirable to obtain the spectrum of the emitted radiation , and to be able to correlate the emitted power with the dynamics ( say , the velocity ) of the interface .    </S>",
    "<S> if it turns out that hawking radiation from the ab interface of @xmath26he is highly suppressed ( or absent ) , we will be left with the challenge of finding a quantum black hole analog . </S>",
    "<S> this is an exciting quest . </S>",
    "<S> it is probably also our only hope for experimentally testing current ideas on quantum black holes and other cosmological problems . </S>"
