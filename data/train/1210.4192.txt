    "the aim of this work is to study the spectral function of a scalar field , denoted as @xmath0 , coupled via a simple renormalizable yukawa - type interaction to a fermion field @xmath1:@xmath2 we assume that the scalar boson @xmath0 is heavy enough for the decay process @xmath3 to take place .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is unstable and has not a definite mass : a spectral function @xmath4 can be obtained as the imaginary part of the propagator of @xmath5 intuitively , the quantity @xmath6 represents the ` mass distribution ' , that is the probability that the unstable state @xmath0 has a mass between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . while the breit - wigner function represents often a good approximation for @xmath9 deviations",
    "become evident when a more advanced treatment of the problem is undertaken .",
    "a natural condition which must be fulfilled is the normalization equation : @xmath10 which assures the normalization of the probability associated to the mass distribution , i.e. the normalization of the initial unstable state @xmath5 as we shall see , interesting effects connected to eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) emerge when studying this system in detail .",
    "the determination of the propagator of @xmath0 is a necessary step to obtain its spectral function , which is proportional to the imaginary part of the propagator .",
    "we consider a fermionic loop which dresses the bare propagator of @xmath0 and we perform a resummation of this loop contribution .",
    "simple power counting shows that the fermionic loop is divergent .",
    "thus , one has to cure the divergences according to a certain regularization . in this work",
    "we shall use the old - fashioned cutoff regularization : we thus introduce a finite , albeit large , high energy scale @xmath11 namely , we argue that a finite cutoff is better suited to describe a physical situation , in which high energy contributions are effectively suppressed when the energy of the particles circulating in the loop is high enough .",
    "although its precise value , and also the way the high momenta are suppressed are unknown ( a typical choice consists in taking @xmath12 equal to the planck mass ) , the finiteness of the cutoff assures that the condition ( [ norm ] ) is always fulfilled . in turn , a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff can not be eliminated ( by using relations between bare and dressed parameters ) : namely , we find that the form of @xmath4 is ( weakly ) influenced by the precise value of the cutoff . before discussing this main property of our results in detail we briefly recall the ideas behind regularization and renormalization and justify the use of a finite cutoff .",
    "the appearance of divergences in quantum field theory ( qft ) plagued its first stages , up to the development of a successful renormalization program @xcite .",
    "the first step of the renormalization is the regularization procedure , in which the divergent integrals appearing at high orders in perturbation theory are made finite according to a certain prescription : in the already mentioned cutoff regularization  the momenta of the virtual particles are ` cut ' for high values beyond a certain ultraviolet ( uv ) energy scale ( the cutoff ) @xmath12 ; in the pauli - villars approach particles with a large mass @xmath13 ( which plays the role of the high energy scale in this scheme ) are formally introduced in such a way that the ultraviolet contributions cancel ; in the dimensional regularization the integrals are evaluated in @xmath14 dimensions and the divergences appear as @xmath15 contributions .",
    "the use of a certain regularization scheme depends on the problem under study .",
    "in fact , a regularization can ` destroy ' some original symmetries of the lagrangian , and therefore care is needed .",
    "for instance , a cutoff @xmath12 violates gauge invariance ( its restoration is indeed possible , but lengthy @xcite ) , while the pauli - villars and dimensional regularizations preserve it and are therefore usually preferred in explicit calculations in the framework of gauge theories ( though the pauli - villars does not preserve gauge invariance in non - abelian gauge theories ) .",
    "once a qft lagrangian has been regularized , one can reabsorb the divergences into the bare parameters of the theory ( masses and couplings ) plus the wave - function renormalizations ( these steps can be also done by introducing proper counterterms , which order by order assure that the divergences disappear ) . at this point the high energy scale has disappeared from the qft and can be formally set to infinity .",
    "each quantity is perfectly finite and independent on @xmath12 ( or on @xmath13 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is well known that , only for a small subset of qfts , the renormalizable theories , this procedure is possible and no divergence ( i.e. , explicit dependence on the high energy scale ) emerges at higher orders .",
    "indeed , the lagrangian of the standard model ( sm ) contains only renormalizable interactions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "non - renormalizable qfts were regarded in the past as substantially ill - defined because the high - energy scale does not decouple .",
    "formally , one could introduce at each order new counterterms , but the price is the need to introduce new coupling constants at each order .",
    "however , it is interesting to stress that the point of view toward non - renormalizable theories changed in the last decades . especially in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the development of a variety of qfts which are not renormalizable was put forward in order to model nonperturbative qcd phenomena : ( i ) chiral perturbation theory is constructed as a theory of the lightest hadronic states ( the pions in its simplest form ) @xcite ; the lagrangian is organized order - by - order with increasing number of derivatives , which in turn implies an increasing number of pion momenta in the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "the lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory is non - renormalizable , but a successful renormalization program can be carried out order by order .",
    "( ii ) the nambu jona - lasinio model is a model of quarks with a quartic , fermi - like ( non - renormalizable ) interaction",
    ". a finite qcd - driven cutoff of about @xmath17 mev is introduced to correctly describe the vacuum s phenomenology , see for instance ref .",
    "( iii ) although the original @xmath18 model was renormalizable @xcite , modern versions of it are not @xcite .",
    "more in general , nowadays also the sm itself is regarded as an effective model of a yet - unknown theory which represents its ultraviolet completion .",
    "it is indeed known that at energy larger than the planck mass gravity effects are non - negligible .",
    "although a quantum theory of gravity is still not available , we can conclude that the cutoff of the standard model @xmath19 should be smaller than the planck mass , @xmath20 .",
    "but this is an upper limit : @xmath19 could be much smaller than that , up to the order of @xmath21 tev @xmath22 gev .",
    "it is then plausible to conclude that @xmath19 lies in the ( quite broad ) range @xmath23 gev .",
    "however , as long as the cutoff @xmath12 ( or , equivalently , @xmath13 ) in a renormalizable theory is finite but much larger than other dimensionful parameters of the theory , then the results should depend on it at most as @xmath24 , @xmath25 and are therefore very difficult to be seen in low - energy processes .",
    "( moreover , such contributions obviously vanish when the formal limit @xmath26 is taken . )",
    "thus , the cutoff is a physical energy scale , which however does not affect the low - energy behavior of the theory .",
    "this point of view is very well described in  the qft book by zee @xcite , where it is stressed that the regularization is not only a mathematical intermediate step but corresponds in some sense to a physical situation : _ i emphasize that _",
    "@xmath12 _ should be thought of as physical , parametrizing our threshold of ignorance , and not as a mathematical construct .",
    "indeed , physically sensible quantum field theories should all come with an implicit _",
    "@xmath12__. if anyone tries to sell you a field theory claiming that it holds up to arbitrarily high energies , you should check to see if he sold used cars for a living ( pages 146 - 147 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . _ _",
    "having clarified and motivated why we insist on working with a finite cutoff @xmath12 , we come back to the purpose of the present work : namely , we aim to investigate which role plays the cutoff @xmath12 on the spectral function @xmath4 of the unstable scalar state @xmath5 at a first sight , this seems a ill - posed question , cause the cutoff @xmath12 should not affect , for all the reasons described above , a physical quantity such as the spectral function .",
    "( in fact , @xmath4 can be related -for instance- to fermionic pair - production process , whose cross section is described in sec . 2.4 . )",
    "quite surprisingly , we find that this is not the case , and that @xmath4 has a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff : the finite value of @xmath12 influences the width of the peak of the function @xmath4 .",
    "it is then conceivable that one may pin down the value of the high energy scale @xmath12 by studying the spectral function of the low - energy resonance @xmath5 note , this peculiar dependence on the cutoff does not take place in superrenormalizable theories , in which the value of @xmath12 does not affect the form of the spectral function if it is large enough @xcite .",
    "we shall also show that the limit @xmath27 and @xmath26 do not commute .",
    "when @xmath26 is taken first , and consequently the standard renormalization procedure is applied , no dependence on the cutoff is left , but a series of inconsistencies emerges : the spectral function is not localized in the vicinity of the peak , neither for small values of the coupling constant .",
    "this result represents a further hint toward the existence of a finite cutoff .",
    "an immediate application of our formulae can be done in a case which is reminiscent of the higgs boson , which has a coupling of the type of eq .",
    "( [ lint ] ) to fermions .",
    "it must be however clearly stressed that with the simple lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lint ] ) our calculation does not represent a realistic evaluation of the spectral function of the higgs boson : namely , no local gauge invariance is realized in the present simple toy model ( and , in addition , it would also be explicitly broken by the introduction of the cutoff ) , only one channel is taken into account and other channels , such as the four - fermion and the @xmath28 ones , are neglected ; finally also background effects are not considered .",
    "thus , the application of our formulae to the case of the higgs boson ( coupled to only one fermion channel ) must be regarded as a first , simple test to evaluate the possible relevance of the described effect ( the influence of the cutoff ) .",
    "the issue of including finite width effects in the propagators of the fundamental and unstable particles of the sm is very complicated and there have been many attempts to solve it ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . presently , the complex mass renormalization scheme @xcite represents a possible viable solution , see also ref .",
    "@xcite for recent developments on the problem of unitarity in this approach .",
    "again , we do not tackle here the problem of unstable sm particles , but analyse other ( non - perturbative ) aspects related to unstable particles , such as the normalization of their spectral functions , which can not be easily investigated within other schemes .",
    "with all these important cautionary comments in mind , it turns anyhow out that , for the determined higgs mass of @xmath29 gev @xcite , the higgs spectral function is very narrow and thus very well approximated by a simple breit - wigner form .",
    "the dependence on the cutoff , although present in principle , can not be seen in practice , because its influence on the form of @xmath4 is vanishingly small . on the other hand",
    "it is conceivable that other ( pseudo)scalar resonances beyond the minimal sm exist , which are broad and thus could show a direct dependence of the cutoff in their spectral function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we present the model and the calculation of the self - energy and spectral function . in sec .",
    "3 we show the numerical results for some interesting cases and finally in sec .",
    "4 we draw our conclusions and possible future developments . a rich appendix is also included in which we discuss different technicalities and subtle points for the interested reader .",
    "we study the following renormalizable lagrangian in which the scalar particle @xmath0 ( with bare mass @xmath30 ) is coupled to the fermion field @xmath1 ( with mass @xmath31):@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "thus , the lagrangian describes a simple yukawa interaction of a massive fermion with a massive scalar boson .      as a first step we evaluate the tree - level decay width for the process @xmath34 for future purposes we evaluate it for the arbitrary mass @xmath7 of the particle @xmath0 : @xmath35 where the amplitude reads : @xmath36 following the usual steps ( details in appendix a.1 ) the tree - level decay width @xmath37 as function of the ( running ) mass @xmath7 reads:@xmath38 naively , the on - shell tree - level decay width is evaluated by setting @xmath39 however , care is needed because it is a well known fact that the mass of the @xmath0 field is modified by loop corrections .",
    "in particular , we will see in the subsections 2.3 and 2.4 that:@xmath40 i.e. the loops reduce the mass .",
    "the numerical value of the tree - level decay width is obtained by evaluation the tree - level decay function at the dressed mass @xmath41 ( and not at the bare mass @xmath30 ) : @xmath42 this procedure is a consequence of renormalization : the mass counterterm added to the lagrangian automatically leads to a tree level decay width computed at the dressed mass which is the physical and thus measurable mass , see appendix a.2.1 for details .",
    "the spectral function , to be studied in details later , can be approximated by the following schematic behavior : @xmath43 where the real part and cutoff - effects in the imaginary part of the loop have been neglected . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the approximate asymptotic behavior @xmath44 holds because the decay function @xmath45 scales as @xmath46 .",
    "such a spectral function is clearly non normalized .",
    "we shall elaborate on this issue more in detail in the following , where we will show that the presence of a cutoff ( no matter how large ) assures that the correct normalization @xmath47 is obtained .",
    "the scalar state @xmath0 is dressed by fermion loops .",
    "the contribution of one fermion loop is easily evaluated by using the feynman rules:@xmath48   \\text { , } \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] where the fermion propagator reads @xmath49    the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is quadratically divergent .",
    "it must be therefore regularized ; for the reasons described in the introduction we use here a regularization function @xmath50 which depends on the cutoff @xmath12:@xmath48   \\phi_{\\lambda}^{2}(p , q)\\text { .}\\ ] ]    upon one - loop resummation the propagator of @xmath0 takes the form@xmath51 where the loop @xmath52 can be rewritten in the following way:@xmath53   \\left [   \\gamma^{\\nu } ( q_{\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}p_{\\nu})+m_{f}\\right ]   \\right ]   } { \\left [   ( q+p/2)^{2}-m_{f}^{2}+i\\varepsilon\\right ]   \\left [   ( q - p/2)^{2}-m_{f}^{2}+i\\varepsilon \\right ]   } \\phi_{\\lambda}^{2}(p , q)\\text { . } \\label{integral}\\ ] ] for what concerns @xmath54 we make here the following assumption:@xmath55 notice that the function is expressed in terms of scalar products of four - vectors and it is thus manifestly covariant . on a practical level we use the following form for @xmath56:@xmath57 where @xmath12 is a cutoff ,",
    "see appendix a.2.1 for more technical details .",
    "the choice in eq .",
    "( [ cutofffunct ] ) is simple and allows for an analytic presentation of many formulae .",
    "however , one could have used smooth and more complicated cutoff functions , see for instance refs . @xcite and refs . therein . only small numerical changes would be found but no conceptual changes would follow .",
    "the trace in the integral ( [ integral ] ) reads : @xmath58   \\left [   \\gamma^{\\nu}\\left (   q_{\\nu}-\\frac{1}{2}p_{\\nu}\\right )   + m_{f}\\right ]   \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   = 4\\left (   q+\\frac{p}{2}\\right )   \\cdot\\left (   q-\\frac{p}{2}\\right ) + 4m_{f}^{2}=4\\left (   q^{2}-\\frac{p^{2}}{4}+m_{f}^{2}\\right )   \\text { .}\\ ] ] then , working in the reference frame of the particle @xmath0 , for which @xmath59 , and performing the integral over @xmath60 by utilizing the residues calculus , one finds:@xmath61   } \\text { , } \\ ] ] where we have taken into account that , in the rest frame of @xmath0 , one has @xmath62",
    "( i.e. , no explicit dependence on @xmath60 is present ) . introducing the variable @xmath63 defined as @xmath64 we rewrite the loop as:@xmath65",
    "the quadratic divergence of the loop is again clear .",
    "the validity of the optical theorem@xmath66 can be easily verified from eq .",
    "( [ lupo ] ) by an explicit calculation of the imaginary part .",
    "strictly speaking , the ` correct ' tree - level decay width , including the effect of the cutoff function , is given by@xmath67 where the vertex - function directly enters into the expression .",

    "however , for @xmath71 the correct tree - level decay function vanishes .",
    "thus , for large values of the cutoff the equality @xmath72 holds for a very wide energy range .",
    "( note , using a smooth cutoff function the strict equality @xmath72 would hold only approximately in a wide energy region . )    in fig .",
    "1 we show the results for the real and imaginary part of the self energy for the following choice of the free parameters : @xmath73 sets an arbitrary energy unit , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "notice that the imaginary part vanishes for values of the energy larger than @xmath76 as explained before .",
    "the gray line represents the quantity @xmath77 which , due to the optical theorem , is equal to the imaginary part of the self energy up to @xmath78 .",
    "the real part becomes also very small for @xmath79 : this is a crucial property to show the correct normalization , as it is presented in the next subsection and in the appendix a.3 .",
    "a closer inspection of the loop expression ( [ lupoexpl ] ) shows that constant terms can still be reabsorbed in the bare mass @xmath30 and have therefore no physical consequences ; however , this does not hold for the the term proportional to @xmath80 which is responsible for a mixing of two , in principle well separated energy scales , i.e. @xmath7 ( which is the invariant mass in a scattering experiment , see the following discussion ) and the cutoff @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in our scheme there is a logarithmic dependence of the cutoff in the loop formula and , consequently , on the form of the spectral function @xmath4 .",
    "this is indeed crucial for our results because this dependence on the high energy scale @xmath12 does not decouple .",
    "indeed , in ref . @xcite it was stated that the physical results ( such as scattering lengths ) do depend on the cutoff in a power - suppressed form @xmath81 @xmath25 .",
    "the new point here is that we find a dependence of the cutoff which is logarithmic and not power - like suppressed . of course , a logarithmic dependence is weak , but can lead to interesting phenomena , as we shall see in sec .",

    "( [ dh ] ) with the previously approximate version in eq .",
    "( [ dhappr ] ) : besides the real part , which is neglected in the approximate form , the two expressions coincide in virtue of the optical theorem for @xmath91 .",
    "we now turn to the normalization of @xmath9 i.e. to the validity of the equation : @xmath92 to this end we recall that the propagator @xmath93 can be expressed via the so - called kllen - lehman representation @xcite:@xmath94 which intuitively corresponds to expressing the full propagator as the ` sum ' of free propagators of the form @xmath95 ^{-1}$ ] , each of them weighted with the mass distribution @xmath96 the physical interpretation of @xmath97 as the probability that the unstable state @xmath0 has a mass between @xmath98 and @xmath99 is evident . when considering the limit @xmath27 the propagator can be approximated as @xmath100 _ provided that _ a finite ( no matter how large ) cutoff @xmath12 is employed . in fact , in the case of a finite cutoff one has that @xmath101 for @xmath102 see the previous section , and also the real part of @xmath103 goes rapidly to zero for @xmath27 . when eq .",
    "( [ proplargep ] ) holds ( i.e. the cutoff is finite ) , eq .",

    "in fact , the cutoff within a ` fundamental renormalizable theory ' signalizes the own breaking of the theory and its numerical value is typically much larger than the other energy scales of the theory ( such as the planck mass ) .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the finite cutoff ( independently on its value ) assures that the mass distribution is already correctly normalized to unity .",
    "there is no need of a field strength renormalization in this framework ; see next section for numerical examples .",
    "some important points need to be discussed .    _",
    "standard renormalization treatment : _ it is possible , using the standard procedure , to remove each dependence on the cutoff .",
    "however , we shall show here and in the appendix a.4 that inconsistencies arise .",
    "the first step consists in choosing a very large cutoff , @xmath106 , which allows to simplify the formula ( [ lupoexpl ] ) for @xmath107 as follows : @xmath108 taking the limit @xmath26 , the propagator corrections require a quadratically divergent mass renormalization to reabsorb the term @xmath109 and a field strength renormalization to reabsorb the term @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "this way can be easily followed in the case of a stable scalar particle , @xmath111 : these two operations correspond to the conditions that the pole of the propagator occurs at @xmath41 and that the residue at the pole is @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath112 ( i.e. , @xmath0 is unstable ) this approach can be formally generalized , although it is not evident which constraint should be imposed to fix the renormalization constants .",
    "we shall discuss the possibilities in sec .",
    "a.4 where we describe in detail the relevant procedure and formulae .    after the renormalization procedure , no dependence on the cutoff is present and the limit for large @xmath7 of the loop function reads @xmath113 ( and does not vanish as eq .",
    "( [ lupoexpl ] ) does . ) as a consequence , the propagator in this case has a different scaling than the one in eq .",
    "( [ proplargep ] ) : @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the limits @xmath27 and @xmath115 do _ not _ commute : this is indeed the main origin of the ( very ) different results obtained in our framework and the ones of the standard renormalization .",
    "moreover , due to the different scaling law , the correct normalization of the spectral function is not anymore guaranteed .",
    "although the integral of the spectral function is still ( slowly ) convergent , one finds rather unphysical results : only a minimal part of the normalization of the spectral function is located in the vicinity of the peak , implying that the probability to excite the resonance at energies close to its nominal mass ( corresponding to the position of the peak ) is very small .",
    "moreover , also the dependence of the normalization on the coupling constant @xmath33 turns out to be unexpected : the smaller @xmath33 , the smaller is the probability that the unstable state @xmath0 has a mass close to the peak .",
    "we regard these properties as unphysical .",

    "a.2.2 and a.2.3 , the calculation of the loop in the pauli - villars and the dimensional regularization schemes . in both cases , as expected , the imaginary part coincides with that obtained in the cutoff scheme if it is sent to infinity , in agreement with the optical theorem . in the pauli - villars a very similar expression for @xmath4 with a finite cutoff @xmath12",
    "is obtained in the vicinity of the peak ( including a logarithmic term of the type @xmath116 , as long as the corresponding cutoff @xmath13 is finite ) .",

    "thus , @xmath4 is explicitly dependent on the cutoff @xmath12 : in particular , an increase of the cutoff implies a logarithmic decrease of the width of the spectral function @xmath143 in turn , this means that there is not a full decoupling of the cutoff .",
    "notice also another remarkable property : the height of the peak do not depend on the cutoff , which regulates solely the width of the peak .    to quantify this peculiar behavior",

    "most importantly , local gauge invariance is fully ignored in our toy model .",
    "( for a treatment of the higgs boson line shape in the framework of the sm , in which dimensional regularization is used , we refer to ref .",
    "thus , with the example of the higgs boson , we want only to estimate if the main result of this paper , i.e. the narrowing of the spectral function for increasing cutoff , could be phenomenologically relevant by using , for the the mass and the coupling constant to fermions , numerical values compatible with the recently determined higgs particle . for the higgs mass we use @xmath158 gev @xcite .",
    "for which the higgs couples sizably in a @xmath159 , then we use @xmath160 gev @xcite . the coupling @xmath33 can be easily determined as @xmath161 where @xmath162 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and @xmath163 takes into account the color degree of freedom ( not present in our lagrangian ) .",
    "the tree - level decay width turns out to be @xmath164 @xmath165 mev and is thus much smaller than the higgs mass .",

    "( in order to obtain a visible effect one should consider a very large and unphysical cutoff of about @xmath169 gev . )",
    "an hypothetical broad scalar boson , eventually also coupled to the vector bosons , would show more visible effects : in the case of large couplings the influence of the cutoff on the spectral function would be sizable . in some extensions of the standard model , which go beyond the minimal higgs coupling , possible other massive scalars and broad particles",
    "are predicted , for which the described effects could possibly be seen .",
    "clearly , the detection of such particles would be itself a proof of physics beyond the sm , but the effect that we point out here is the possibility to determine the value of the cutoff ( i.e. the minimal length ) by using such hypothetical broad states beyond the sm .",
    "presently , albeit appealing , this is only a speculative possibility .",
    "interestingly , the dependence on the cutoff described previously is not only a characteristic of a scalar field coupled to fermions as in the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) , but would be present in each renormalizable lagrangian .",

    "this is a difficult task ; an interesting intermediate step could be the study of a vector boson coupled to fermions ( and a higgs - like particle ) in the framework of a @xmath174 local gauge symmetric theory . while neither this study would be realistic enough",
    ", it would constitute an attempt to take into account the described cutoff effect by using a theoretical model which embodies some of the most salient features of the sm .    on the contrary , the dependence on the cutoff change if a superrenormalizable @xcite or a non - renormalizable lagrangian @xcite are considered .",
    "as already mentioned , in the superrenormalizable case @xmath175 and no dependence of the spectral function on a ( large ) cutoff is visible . on the other hand , for a non - renormalizable theory @xmath176",
    "the theory makes sense only if the cutoff is small .",
    "in this work we have computed the spectral function of a scalar boson coupled to fermions via resummation of the one loop contributions into the scalar propagator .",
    "the propagator satisfies the kllen - lehman representation and the corresponding spectral function is normalized to unity _ when _ a finite ( no matter how large ) cutoff on the energy of the unstable boson is used .",
    "the correct normalization is clearly connected with the completeness of the basis of the states into which the unstable particle state is decomposed .",
    "the finite cutoff , in turn , affects the properties of the spectral function : the breit - wigner width indeed narrows as the cutoff increases . in a fundamental theory ,",
    "the existence of a energy cutoff is often connected to a change of degrees of freedom and thus , within the standard model of particle physics , the cutoff would indicate the energy scale at which ` new physics ' is expected .",
    "another possibility is the existence of a minimal length such as the one coming from a discrete structure of the space - time . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", the measurement of the line shape of an unstable boson could signal the existence of the cutoff : phenomena occurring at very high energy could influence low energy properties of the system . using the recently determined higgs boson mass and its coupling to a fermion type ( the @xmath177 quark ) only",
    ", we have provided a simple order of magnitude estimate of the effect of the finite cutoff on the spectral function .",
    "it turned out that this effect is vanishinlgy small",
    ". the situation could be different if new and broad particles beyond sm would exist but , at the moment , this is only a speculative possibility .",
    "interestingly , also hadronic physics , where the cutoff is related to the scale of confinement , some interesting modification of the spectral function could have a phenomenological relevance , for instance for the medium modification of the @xmath178 meson spectral function which heavy ions experiments are looking for .",
    "there are two possible future directions to be taken : on the theoretical side , one should go beyond the resummed fermionic one - loop approximation considered here .",
    "the next - to - leading order correction for the propagator of the unstable state @xmath0 arises when considering an insertion of a scalar virtual exchange in the fermionic loop .",
    "this diagram , which is of order @xmath179 , should be also resummed .",
    "being the scalar propagator also part of the dressing , one has a problem of the dyson - schwinger type , which is obviously more difficult to solve and the renormalization of the charge would be necessary within this context .",
    "moreover , also the renormalization of the charge would be necessary at this order .",
    "anyhow , considering that the presented considerations about the finiteness of the cutoff are rather general , we do not expect a qualitative change of our results .",
    "however , a mathematical proof that this is the case would be very valuable .",
    "on the phenomenological side , we plan to compute the spectral functions of vector bosons coupled to fermions , which is potentially relevant for the weak interaction .",
    "namely , the presented phenomena are quite general for each renormalizable theory , and therefore should apply to the weak gauge bosons . in this way we can study the effect of a putative cutoff in the weak sector as well .    in the end",

    "<S> we present the calculation of the spectral function of an unstable scalar boson coupled to fermions as resulting from the resummation of the one loop diagrams in the scalar particle self energy . </S>",
    "<S> we work with a large but finite high - energy cutoff : in this way , the spectral function of the scalar field is always correctly normalized to unity , independently on the value of the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this high energy cutoff affects the breit - wigner width of the unstable particle : the larger the cutoff , the smaller is the width at fixed coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the existence of a high energy cutoff ( alias minimal length ) , and for instance the possible opening of new degrees of freedom beyond that energy scale , could then be in principle proven by measuring , at lower energy scales , the line shape of the unstable scalar state . </S>",
    "<S> although the lagrangian here considered represents only a toy - model , we discuss possible future extensions of our work which could be relevant for particle physics phenomenology . </S>"
