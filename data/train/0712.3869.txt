    "this description can be summarized in the form of two theorems usually called the first and the second ritt theorems ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first ritt theorem states that for any two maximal decompositions @xmath15 of a polynomial @xmath1 there exists a chain of maximal decompositions @xmath16 , @xmath17 of @xmath1 such that @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 is obtained from @xmath21 @xmath22 by replacing two successive functions in @xmath16 by other functions with the same composition .",
    "this implies in particular that any two maximal decompositions of a polynomial have the same length .",
    "below we will call two maximal decompositions @xmath15 of a rational function @xmath1 such that there exists a chain as above _",
    "weakly equivalent_. this defines an equivalence relation on the set of maximal decompositions of @xmath1 .",
    "the first ritt theorem reduces the description of maximal decompositions of polynomials to the description of indecomposable polynomial solutions of the equation ac = bdsuch that the decompositions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - equivalent , and the second ritt theorem states if @xmath25 is such a solution then there exist polynomials @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and up to a possible replacement of @xmath30 by @xmath31 and @xmath32 by @xmath33 either @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a polynomial , @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 or @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the corresponding chebyshev polynomials , @xmath41 and @xmath42 furthermore , the second ritt theorem remains true for arbitrary polynomial solutions of if to replace equalities @xmath43 by the equalities @xmath44 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    notice that the classification of polynomial solutions of appears in a variety of different contexts some of which are quite unexpected .",
    "for example , this classification is closely related to the problem of description of diophantine equations of the form @xmath45 @xmath46,$ ] having an infinite number of integer solutions ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and to the problem of description of polynomials @xmath47 satisfying the equality @xmath48 for some compact sets @xmath49 , recently solved in @xcite .",
    "notice also that the problem of description of solutions of such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are polynomials while @xmath52 are allowed to be arbitrary rational ( or even just continuous ) functions on the sphere can be reduced to the description of polynomial solutions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed account of different results related to the second ritt theorem can be found in the recent papers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the classification of polynomial solutions of essentially reduces to the description of polynomials @xmath52 such that the algebraic curve a(x)-b(y)=0has an irreducible factor of genus zero with one point at infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "the proof of the first ritt theorem can be given in purely algebraic terms which do not involve the genus condition in any form .",
    "indeed , if @xmath53 is the monodromy group of a rational function @xmath1 then equivalence classes of maximal decompositions of @xmath1 are in a one - to - one correspondence with maximal chains of subgroups g_(f)=t_0 < t_1 <  ...",
    "< t_r = g(f),where @xmath54 is the stabilizer of an element @xmath55 in the group @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , any two maximal decompositions of @xmath1 are weakly equivalent if and only if for any two maximal chains of subgroups as above @xmath57 @xmath58 there exists a collection of maximal chains of subgroups @xmath59 , @xmath17 such that @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 is obtained from @xmath63 @xmath22 by a replacement of exactly one group .",
    "it was shown in the paper @xcite ( theorem r.3 ) that the last condition is satisfied for any permutation group @xmath64 containing an abelian transitive subgroup .",
    "since the monodromy group of a polynomial always contains a cyclic subgroup with one orbit ( its generator corresponds to the loop around infinity ) , this implies in particular the truth of the first ritt theorem for polynomials .",
    "it was also proved in the paper @xcite ( claim 1 ) that if @xmath25 are indecomposable polynomials satisfying such that the decompositions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non - equivalent then the groups @xmath65 and @xmath66 as well as the groups @xmath67 and @xmath68 are permutation equivalent",
    ". since any two maximal decompositions of a polynomial @xmath69 are weakly equivalent , this implies by induction that for any two maximal decompositions of @xmath69 there exists a permutation @xmath70 such that the monodromy groups of @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 are permutation equivalent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the algebraic counterpart of this fact is the following statement : if @xmath74 is a permutation group containing a cyclic subgroup with one orbit then for any two maximal chains @xmath75 the equality @xmath11 holds and there exists a permutation @xmath70 such that the permutation group induced by the action of @xmath76 on cosets of @xmath77 is permutation equivalent to the permutation group induced by the action of @xmath78 on cosets of @xmath79 @xmath80 if a permutation group @xmath64 satisfies this condition , we will say that @xmath64 satisfies the _ jordan - h \" older theorem for imprimitivity systems_.    in this paper , we extend the above results about the permutation groups @xmath64 containing a cyclic group with one orbit to the permutation groups containing a cyclic subgroup @xmath81 with at most _ two _ orbits and apply these results to rational functions ( or more generally to meromorphic functions on compact riemann surfaces ) the monodromy group of which contains @xmath82    first , we prove that for a permutation group @xmath64 containing @xmath81 the lattice @xmath83 , consisting of subgroups of @xmath64 containing @xmath84 , is lower semi - modular and even a stronger condition of the modularity of @xmath83 holds whenever @xmath83 does not contain a sublattice isomorphic to the subgroup lattice of a dihedral group .",
    "it follows easily from the lower semimodularity of @xmath83 that one can pass from any chain of subgroups to any other such a chain by a sequence of replacements as above and therefore the first ritt theorem extends to rational functions the monodromy group of which contains @xmath81 .",
    "notice that this implies in particular that the first ritt theorem holds for rational functions with at most two poles .",
    "although for such functions the result was know previously ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) the algebraic proof turns out to be more simple and illuminating .",
    "notice also that our description of the lattice @xmath83 for groups @xmath64 containing @xmath81 has an interesting connection with the problem of description of algebraic curves having a factor of genus zero with at most two points at infinity , studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "further , we prove that if a permutation group @xmath64 contains a cyclic subgroup with two orbits of _ different length _ then the lattice @xmath83 is always modular and @xmath64 satisfies the jordan - h \" older theorem for imprimitivity systems .",
    "this implies in particular that if @xmath1 is a rational function which has only two poles and the orders of these poles are different between themselves then any two maximal decompositions of @xmath1 have the same length and there exists a permutation @xmath85 such that the monodromy groups of @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath86 are permutation equivalent .",
    "we also show that the jordan - h \" older theorem for imprimitivity systems holds for any permutation group containing a transitive hamiltonian subgroup that generalizes the corresponding results of @xcite , @xcite .    for arbitrary rational functions the first ritt theorem fails to be true .",
    "the simplest counterexamples are provided by the functions which are regular coverings of the sphere ( that is for which @xmath87 ) with the monodromy group @xmath88 @xmath89 , or @xmath90 these functions were described for the first time by f. klein in @xcite and nowadays can be interpreted as belyi functions of platonic solids ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for such a function its maximal decompositions simply correspond to maximal chains of subgroups in its monodromy group . therefore , since any of the groups @xmath91 , @xmath92 @xmath93 has maximal chains of subgroups of different length , for the corresponding klein functions the first ritt theorem is not true .    although the fact that the klein functions provide counterexamples to the first ritt theorem is a well known part of the mathematical `` folklore '' , the systematic description of compositional properties of these functions seems to be absent . in particular , to our best knowledge maximal decompositions which do not satisfy the first ritt theorem were found explicitly only for the klein function corresponding to the group @xmath91 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in the appendix to this paper",
    "we provide a detailed analysis of maximal decompositions of the klein functions and give related explicit examples of non weakly equivalent maximal decompositions . in particular , we give an example of a rational function with _ three _ poles having maximal decompositions of different length .",
    "this example shows that with no additional assumptions the first ritt theorem can not be extended to rational functions the monodromy of which contains a cyclic subgroup with more than two orbits .",
