    "we conclude that at nonzero temperature , when the density of the normal component , @xmath127 , is nonzero , the current reverses its direction with respect to @xmath128 if the latter becomes smaller than @xmath129 .",
    "in the paper by volkov and kogan @xcite , the problem of evolution of the order parameter @xmath130 at given initial value of the wdf ( and corresponding initial self - consistent value of @xmath131 ) was analyzed within a linear approximation , assuming small deviations of @xmath130 and @xmath132 from their equilibrium values .",

    ", we address a more general nonlinear problem , with arbitrary initial conditions , which may essentially differ from the equilibrium state .",
    "in particular , this allows us to consider formation of the superconducting state from the initial normal state at low enough temperatures , or destruction of the initial superconducting state at high temperatures . to this end",
    ", we apply a numerical procedure , by making use of the so - called riccati parametrization of the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 . due to the normalization condition ( [ norm ] )",

    "( [ delta2 ] ) after each time step @xmath147 , and then use it for the next step . for sufficiently small @xmath147 , @xmath7 can be approximately considered as constant between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which allows us to apply an analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ riccati ] ) within this time interval , @xmath150 and thus to calculate @xmath151 explicitly . as the result",
    ", the numerical procedure reduces to the numerical solution of the self - consistency equation at each step of calculations .      in our calculations ,",
    "we use time steps @xmath153 . after each step ,",
    "the values of the modulus and the phase of @xmath130 were recalculated by means of the self - consistency equation ( 31 ) . in figs .  1 and 2 , we present time variations of the order parameter modulus with the initial values @xmath137 essentially different from the equilibrium value @xmath138 at @xmath152 .",
    "it is obvious that equal values of @xmath137 may be obtained for different forms of the initial wigner distribution function @xmath154 . in our evaluation",
    ", we use the equilibrium form of @xmath154 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqcond ] ) at @xmath152 , with a formal parameter @xmath155 , which , however , appears to be slightly different from the initial self - consistent value @xmath137 .",
    "this difference weakly depends on the value of the pairing constant @xmath156 , which we in the following put @xmath157 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath158 leads to @xmath159 ( fig .  1 ) , whereas @xmath160 yields self - consistent @xmath161 ( fig .",
    "another type of perturbation in the system is the switching of the @xmath156 from one value to another . or , more generally , the case of time dependent bcs pairing .",
    "we have used the equations ( 35 ) , ( 36 ) , ( 38 ) and ( 31 ) ( with @xmath162 ) to study this problem numerically . in fig.3 the collisionless evolution of the order parameter under the changing of @xmath156 in time is shown .",
    "it is interesting to note that the initial bcs form of the wdf automatically leads to conservation of arbitrary initial value of the order parameter phase @xmath73 .",
    "actually , such property is associated with the definite symmetry of the initial wdf with respect to @xmath165 , which holds during the time evolution , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and manifests equality of the populations of the electron- and hole - like excitations with equal energies @xmath168 .",
    "the introduction of an imbalance between the electron and hole branches of the excitation spectrum ( i.e. , violation of the above - mentioned symmetry ) produces an excess charge in the quasiparticle subsystem which , due to electroneutrality of the metal , should be compensated by the opposite charge of the superfluid condensate .",
    "this means the appearance of the difference @xmath169 between the electrochemical potentials @xmath170 and @xmath171 of excitations and the condensate , respectively , which produces time variations of the order parameter phase according to the relationship @xmath172 . for a given constant @xmath169",
    ", we find continuous variation of the phase with a constant rate .",
    "the processes of formation and destruction of the superconducting state can be also analyzed within the nonlinear collisionless approach . by starting evaluations from a very small value of @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) in eq .",
    "( [ fg0 ] ) at @xmath152 , which approximately represents initial normal state ( see fig .  4 , we observe a rapid increase in @xmath130 at the time @xmath175 up to @xmath176 , followed by an oscillatory approach to a stable superconducting state .",
    "we note that the asymptotic value @xmath177 appears to be noticeably lower than @xmath138 , which means that the real equilibrium value of @xmath7 at the superconducting transition is formed via the relaxation processes .      strictly speaking , at any temperature , including the region @xmath179 , the self - consistency equation ( [ delta ] ) always has a trivial solution @xmath180 , which corresponds to the normal state .",
    "however , at @xmath179 , the normal state is associated with a maximum of the free energy , and therefore fig .",
    "4 actually illustrates the thermodynamic instability of the normal state with respect to an infinitesimal @xmath7 , which develops through the quantum kinetic process described by eqs .",
    "( [ homeq1 ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , despite the strong nonlinearity of the process , the oscillations of @xmath181 have almost purely harmonic shape .",
    "the instability of the superconducting state at the temperature @xmath182 is illustrated by fig .",
    "5 , which was obtained by starting evaluations from the initial superconducting state in eq .",
