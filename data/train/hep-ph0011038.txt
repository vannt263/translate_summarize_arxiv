    "in hard inclusive electro - weak processes the soft physics is described by light - cone correlators of quark fields . for a target",
    "hadron , for instance , all the relevant soft physics resides in the correlator @xcite @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the parent hadron momentum and spin , and the relevant component of the quark momentum is @xmath4 , the light - cone momentum fraction .",
    "the components @xmath5 stem from vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , satisfying @xmath8 = 0 and @xmath9 = 1 , which are fixed by the momentum that introduces the large scale @xmath10 , together with a ( soft ) hadron momentum .",
    "when only the leading part in orders of @xmath11 is considered , just the @xmath12 part of the correlator suffices .",
    "this part is usually parametrized in terms of the following quark distribution functions  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the projector of good fields @xmath15 @xcite . for these functions some trivial bounds and the",
    ", less trivial , so - called soffer bound have been derived @xcite .",
    "if , now , one regards processes involving more than one hadron @xcite , quark transverse momentum becomes relevant @xcite .",
    "a correlator with transverse momentum leads to an extended set of distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to sketch the derivation of bounds for the additional functions in this extended set .",
    "a first observation in the derivation of the bounds is that the leading part of the correlator , now being non - diagonal in target spin space in contrast to ( [ phiint ] ) , @xmath16 after inserting a complete set of intermediate states , can be written in the following way @xmath17 which is a positive semi - definite quantity .",
    "this property is not affected by inclusion of transverse momentum .",
    "next , target spin dependence is incorporated using a spin density matrix formalism .",
    "m(s ) = [ spindens ] all target polarization information is in @xmath18 , while the spin dependence resides in the higher dimensionality of @xmath19 . for a spin-@xmath20 target ,",
    "@xmath3 is just a vector with properties @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( being equal to @xmath23 for a pure state ) and @xmath24 is just @xmath25 in target spin space . in the target rest frame",
    "@xmath18 simplifies to @xmath26 and @xmath24 assumes the form @xmath27 where the subscripts refer to target polarization @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . from the diagonal elements of this matrix one sees that it lives in the space spanned by states with @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in order to describe transverse target polarization",
    "one needs the off - diagonal elements .",
    "now , we turn our attention to quark spin . the analogon of ( [ phiint ] ) when quark transverse momentum is taken into account , is given by the sum of three parts _ o(x , p_)^+ & = & \\ { f_1(x , p_^2 ) + ih_1^(x , p_^2 ) } p_+ + _ l(x , p_)^+ & = & \\ { s_lg_1l(x , p_^2)_5 + s_lh_1l^(x , p_^2 ) _ 5 } p_+ + _ t(x , p_)^+ & = & \\ { f_1t^(x , p_^2 ) + g_1t(x , p_^2 ) _ 5 + & & + h_1t(x , p_^2)_5s/_+ h_1t^(x , p_^2 ) } p_+ .",
    "choosing for the above objects a convenient ( weyl ) representation , one sees that they are effectively @xmath25 in quark spin space .",
    "the leading part of the correlator is spanned by just two types of quarks ; left and right - handed ( good ) quarks .",
    "if we now put everything together to obtain @xmath32 ( or it s transpose in dirac space @xmath33 , to be more precise ) , from an expression like ( [ spindens ] ) , one concludes that the @xmath24 needed for the description including transverse momentum , is the following .",
    "@xmath34 this matrix lives in the product space of target helicity and quark handedness .",
    "the upper - right as the lower - left @xmath25 submatrices are solely populated by so called chiral - odd functions @xcite , that involve the flipping of quark handedness , whereas the diagonal submatrices contain merely chiral - even functions .",
    "whithin each of these @xmath25 matrices , the diagonal elements involve no and longitudinal polarization , as these states can be expressed in the helicity eigenstates of the target , whereas the non - diagonal ones involve transverse polarization as expected from ( [ spindens ] ) . in ( [ bigmatrix ] )",
    "all distribution functions particular to transverse quark momentum are accompanied by an azimuthal dependence .",
    "this dependence averages to zero after integration over azimuthal angle , showing that taking into account transverse momentum is necessary to access the full helicity structure of a polarized nucleon @xcite .",
    "the sought for bounds follow from the fact that for any vector @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 .",
    "if an integration over azimuthal angle is perfomed first and after that positive semi - definiteness is demanded , one finds the soffer bound . note that the t - odd functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be considered as imaginary parts of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "regarding 2-dimensional subspaces in ( [ bigmatrix ] ) starts giving us non - trivial bounds on the distribution functions . omitting the @xmath41 dependences of these functions",
    "one finds @xmath42 in order to incorporate the more elaborate bounds that are found considering higher dimensional subspaces of the matrix ( [ bigmatrix ] ) , it is convenient to introduce two positive - definite functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 and also h_1 & = & a , + h_1t^ & = & b , + ( g_1 t + if_1t^ ) & = & , + ( h_1l^ + ih_1^ ) & = & .",
    "here @xmath47 , @xmath48,@xmath49 and @xmath50 all depend on both @xmath51 and @xmath52 and have absolute values in the interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real - valued whereas @xmath49 and @xmath50 are complex - valued .",
    "their imaginary parts determine the strength of the t - odd functions . in terms of these functions , what is required to be positive semi - definite are the following four expressions e_1,2 = ( 1-)a + ( 1+)b , + e_3,4 = ( 1+)a + ( 1-)b , leading to & & a+b0 , + & & a - b a+b ,  h_1tf_1 , + & & + ^2 ( 1-)(1 + ) , + & & - ^2 ( 1+)(1- ) .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "one can see the a graphical representation of the allowed values for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is remarkable to see that to see that an inclusively measured function as @xmath54 is involved in a bound including functions as @xmath39 and @xmath55 which can not be measured inclusively and are responsible for asymmetries @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that though in this talk only distribution functions have been addressed , an almost identical analysis can be performed on fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "the non - vanishing of t - odd functions , though disputed in the case of distribution functions yet a possibility @xcite , is accepted in the case of fragmentation functions , such as @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath57 @xcite , as time - reversal invariance can not be imposed on the final state @xcite .",
    "this work can also straightforwardly be extended to spin-@xmath58 hadrons @xcite and gluons @xcite . though it should be supplemented with a study of the factorization , scheme dependence and stability of the bounds under @xmath59 evolution @xcite",
    ", these bounds provide an estimate of the magnitudes of functions measured in asymmetries at smc @xcite , hermes @xcite and lep @xcite .    30 a.bacchetta , m.boglione , a.henneman and p.j .",
