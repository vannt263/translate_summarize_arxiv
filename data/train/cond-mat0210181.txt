    "if electrons did not interact , only the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite would occur in nature .",
    "the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite signaled the existence of a new correlated state of matter , the essence of which lies in the formation of quantum particles called composite fermions , @xcite which are bound states of electrons and an even number of quantized vortices .",
    "electrons avoid each other most efficiently by turning into composite fermions , which , in turn , interact much more weakly than electrons . for a large number of phenomena , it is a valid first approximation to neglect the interaction between composite fermions altogether , indicating that the interaction between composite fermions can often be treated perturbatively and does not cause any phase transitions .",
    "the fundamental property of composite fermions , which is responsible for the dramatic phenomenology of two - dimensional systems in high magnetic fields , is that as they move about , the aharonov bohm phase is partly canceled by the phase produced by the vortices tied to other composite fermions and as a result they experience an _ effective _ magnetic field @xmath3 given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the external magnetic field , @xmath6 is the electron density ( in two dimensions ) , the even integer @xmath7 is the vorticity of composite fermions ( cf s ) , and @xmath8 .",
    "( the composite fermion with vorticity @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath9cf or cf-@xmath7 . )",
    "they form landau - like levels in this reduced magnetic field , with their filling factor ( @xmath10 ) related to the electron filling factor ( @xmath11 ) by @xmath12 the wave functions for composite fermions are given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the position of the @xmath15th particle , @xmath16 is an antisymmetric wave function for fermions at the effective filling @xmath10 , and @xmath17 is the lowest landau level ( lll ) projection operator .",
    "the wave function @xmath18 is of course the wave function of correlated electrons at @xmath11 , but can also be interpreted as the wave function of composite fermions at filling factor @xmath10 , because on the right hand side , each electron has @xmath7 vortices bound to it through the multiplicative factor @xmath19 , which converts each electron in into a composite fermion .",
    "let us begin by neglecting the interaction between composite fermions . in this case",
    ", a gap opens up when the composite fermions fill an integral number of levels , i.e. , when @xmath20 , which corresponds to electron filling factors given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a positive or negative integer .",
    "[ the negative values of @xmath22 give @xmath23 , and correspond to the situation in which the effective field @xmath3 is opposite to the external field @xmath5 . ] the model of non - interacting composite fermions thus predicts quantum hall effect ( qhe ) of electrons at these fractions , and also at @xmath24 due to particle hole symmetry in the lowest landau level .",
    "( the fractions in eq .  [ f2 ] can be obtained by formulating the problem in terms of _ holes _ rather than electrons in the lowest landau level , and then making composite fermions out of them . ) the qhe at these filling factors will be termed ",
    "cf-@xmath7 qhe . \"",
    "cf-2 qhe and cf-4 qhe are routine , and cf-6 qhe and cf-8 qhe have also been observed @xcite .",
    "these sequences exhaust most of the more than 50 observed fractions to date in the lowest landau level .",
    "the wave functions have been tested in detail for finite systems , and are very accurate , without involving any adjustable parameter@xcite .    in short ,",
    "most of the qhe can be understood as the integral qhe of appropriate fermions .",
    "it ought to be noted that the qhe of higher order composite fermions can be viewed as a consequence of interactions between lower order composite fermions .",
    "for example , the cf-4 qhe originates from interactions between cf-2 s . nonetheless , the physics of all states at filling factors of eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) is correctly described in terms of _ non_-interacting composite fermions of the appropriate kind .",
    "while the above fractions are obtained most immediately in the cf theory , it has been known since the very beginning of the composite fermion theory that other fractions are not ruled out.@xcite new qhe _ between _ two successive integral hall states of composite fermions will be called nqhe , where n stands for  nested . \" a simple scenario for nqhe",
    "is as follows .",
    "consider electrons in the filling factor range @xmath25 which map into @xmath9cf s in the range @xmath26 containing @xmath22 levels fully occupied and the @xmath27 level partially occupied .",
    "it is a natural conjecture that inter - cf interaction can possibly cause gaps at @xmath28 which will produce new fractions between the familiar fractions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . here , the @xmath9cf s in the topmost partially filled level capture @xmath31 vortices ( as a result of the residual @xmath9cf-@xmath9cf interaction ) to turn into higher order composite fermions ( @xmath32cf s ) and condense into @xmath33 levels , thereby opening a gap and producing quantum hall effect .",
    "this qhe state is a nested state with higher order composite fermions forming in the background of the original composite fermions .",
    "certain qualitative consequences of the above scenario are as follows .",
    "the nqhe of composite fermions is analogous to qhe of electrons between two successive iqhe states of electrons , that is , to fqhe in _ higher _ electronic landau levels .",
    "it is known that fqhe is rare in second electronic landau levels ( i.e. , in the range @xmath34 , including spin degeneracy ) and non - existent in third or higher landau levels ; by analogy , nqhe is expected to be rare . extending the analogy further , the strongest nqhe states for fully spin polarized composite fermions are expected to be at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which correspond to electron filling factors @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; these are expected to be the strongest nested",
    "cf states @xcite .",
    "recently , pan _",
    "_ @xcite have reported observation of 4/11 and 5/13 , heralding a new generation of quantum hall effect that can not be understood as the iqhe of composite fermions .",
    "this discovery has given fresh impetus to the issue of nqhe , especially because it is possible that more nqhe states will be observed in the future as the sample quality improves and the temperature drops , reminiscent of how the fqhe appeared on top of the iqhe .",
    "what other nested states are possible ? what is the true nature of these states ?",
    "such questions have motivated us to investigate this topic further .    even though the theoretical scenario described above",
    "is plausible , and indeed natural , there is no _ a priori _ guarantee that it actually occurs , and it is important to carry out quantitative tests to ascertain its applicability to the real world . it is worth recalling here that not all fractions that can occur _ in principle _ do really occur in nature .",
    "for example , fqhe can occur for some hypothetical interaction at very small filling factors , but is preempted by wigner crystal for the coulomb interaction , and in higher landau levels , the fqhe is often believed to be unstable to charge - density - wave type state .",
    "therefore , it would require further theoretical work before one could claim with any degree of confidence that nqhe based on the physics described above is actually possible .",
    "the quantitative theoretical investigations so far suggest that there should be _ no _ fqhe at fractions other than those in eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) for fully spin - polarized electrons .",
    "an exact diagonalization study @xcite of @xmath39 electrons at 4/11 finds a non - uniform ground state , which is an evidence against fqhe liquid . in another approach @xcite",
    ", a model has been developed for the effective interaction between composite fermions in the second level . in ref .",
    "it was argued that no new fqhe is obtained @xcite .",
    "ref .   found that the form of this interaction favors a  bubble crystal \" of composite fermions at filling factors like 4/11 rather than the quantum hall effect .",
    "these studies indicate that the effective interaction between composite fermions is not sufficiently strongly repulsive to stabilize fqhe at 4/11 and several other fractions .",
    "both approaches have their problems . in exact diagonalization ,",
    "the system is effectively small , with only @xmath40 composite fermions in the second level , and one may question if the conclusion based on this system will hold up as @xmath41 increases .",
    "the effective interaction model involves several assumptions , because of which the results are plausible but not conclusive .    in ref",
    ".   showed that fqhe at 4/11 is very likely possible for a _ partially _ spin polarized system or a spin unpolarized system .",
    "it is not yet known for sure if the fqhe states at 4/11 and 5/13 are partially or fully polarized in the experiments of pan _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite but given the relatively high magnetic fields at which these states have been observed , it is quite possible that they are fully spin polarized , and therefore it is worth revisiting the issue of whether fully polarized incompressible states can be found theoretically at these filling fractions .",
    "that is the prime motivation behind our present study . in this work",
    ", we will look for fqhe at several filling fractions in the range between 1/3 and 2/5 .",
    "we will study finite systems of @xmath41 particles at total flux @xmath42 ( in units of the flux quantum @xmath8 ) , where the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath43 for a given filling factor will be derived from the physics described above . the most reliable theoretical method would be exact diagonalization . however , because of the exponentially growing hilbert space , exact diagonalization is possible only for very small systems , and very few filling factors .",
    "for example , for @xmath37 , exact diagonalization has been possible for @xmath39 electrons.@xcite the next system contains @xmath44 ( in the spherical geometry , discussed below ) , for which the lowest landau level hilbert space contains a total of @xmath45 slater determinant basis states ; the diagonalization of matrices of such sizes is beyond the reach of present day computers .",
    "we have developed a powerful new method , namely diagonalization in low - energy composite - fermion basis ( lecfb ) , which we believe gives accurate results .",
    "it exploits the fact that the composite fermion theory allows us to directly identify low - energy states of the full hilbert space , which lets us work within a sub - space much smaller than the full hilbert space .",
    "for example , we have been able to obtain the low - energy spectrum for the 4/11 state with as many as 24 electrons , where the dimension of the full hilbert space is @xmath2 .",
    "a brief outline of the method is as follows .",
    "consider the filling factor range given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "given that the two ends of this range are well described as @xmath46 and @xmath22 filled levels of composite fermions , it is natural to expect that the low energy states at @xmath11 contain @xmath22 composite fermion levels completely occupied , and the remaining composite fermions in the @xmath27 level .",
    "the configurations that involve promotion of composite fermions to higher kinetic energy levels are expected to cost substantially higher energy and are neglected . in other words , we include all configurations of type shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_1 ] ) but neglect configurations of the type shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "this neglect of composite - fermion landau level mixing is the only assumption in our approach , which can be tested for consistency at the end of the calculation .",
    "other than that the method is exact .",
    "the most important point here is that we do not make any assumption with regard to the interaction between composite fermions , or their structure in the partially filled level . in our calculation",
    ", we first construct all states of composite fermions at @xmath47 , with the lowest @xmath22 levels fully occupied and the next one with filling factor @xmath48 , and then diagonalize the coulomb hamiltonian within this sector to obtain the spectrum of low energy states .",
    "the calculation is rather involved , requiring extensive monte carlo , but still numerically stable , and yields reliable results .",
    "the present method is a significant advance over the variational method of ref .  .",
    "it is much more reliable because it eliminates several approximations made in that work . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the problem of composite fermions at @xmath47 was mapped into that of fermions at @xmath48 .",
    "further , it was assumed that the interaction energy of the system of composite fermions in the partially filled level can be approximated by a sum of two - body interactions .",
    "the interaction between composite fermions was obtained by keeping only two composite fermions in the @xmath27 level and integrating out the composite fermions of the lower filled levels . in general , when there are many composite fermions in the @xmath27 level , the integrating out of the lower - level composite fermions will produce a quite complex interaction , with two- , three- , and @xmath22-body terms , because the full system is strongly correlated .",
    "the hope was that the @xmath22-body terms do not cause any phase transitions , in which case the two - body terms will produce the correct state . however , this approximation was untested . finally , the method was a variational study , in which the energies of certain wave functions were compared to determine which had the lowest energy ; there was of course no guarantee that this state would describe the true ground state .",
    "in contrast , in the present study , we work with the full composite fermion system and do not assume anything about the form of the interaction between composite fermions or the nature of their ground state .    the following section contains a discussion of how we construct the low - energy composite fermion basis and how we carry out the gram - schmid orthogonalization and diagonalization .",
    "the reader not interested in the technical details can skip this section and directly proceed to the subsequent section , wherein the results are given and their implications are discussed .",
    "we first summarize certain relevant facts from the introduction .",
    "the electron filling factor @xmath11 given by @xmath49 corresponds to composite fermion filling factor @xmath10 .",
    "we will be interested below in the specific values of @xmath10 given by @xmath50 here , composite fermions fill @xmath22 levels completely and occupy @xmath48 fraction of the @xmath27 level .",
    "if the @xmath9cf s in the partially occupied level capture @xmath31 additional vortices and condense into @xmath33 filled landau level state , then a gap would open up and nqhe would be obtained .",
    "the question is whether this mechanism really occurs in nature .    in the composite fermion theory ,",
    "there are several possible approaches for constructing a low energy basis . in this work ,",
    "we construct a lecfb of _ all _ states at @xmath47 in which @xmath22 @xmath9cf levels are fully occupied and the next level has filling @xmath48 .",
    "we do not make any approximation regarding the structure of @xmath9cf s in the partially filled level .",
    "this basis is in principle straightforward : we simply need to take all _ electronic _ states at @xmath47 and attach @xmath7 vortices to obtain the composite fermion states .",
    "the method , however , is technically rather demanding , and the present section is devoted to it .",
    "we will employ the spherical geometry in which @xmath41 electrons move on the surface of a sphere under the influence of a radial magnetic field @xmath5 created by a magnetic monopole at the center .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath5 field is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is known as the flux quantum , @xmath53 is the radius of the sphere , and @xmath43 is called the monopole strength which should be either an integer or a half - integer because of dirac s quantization condition .",
    "the interacting electron system at monopole strength @xmath43 maps into a system of weakly interacting composite fermions at an effective monopole strength @xmath54 .",
    "the wave functions for interacting electrons at @xmath43 are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the wave function for the fully occupied lowest landau level , and @xmath57 are antisymmetric wave functions at @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is in general a linear superposition of slater - determinant basis states made up of the monopole harmonics , @xmath60 , given by @xcite : @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63=0,1,2 , ... is the landau level ( ll ) index , to be differentiated from @xmath22 , the number of filled landau levels .",

    "it has been tested in the past and was found to be remarkably accurate @xcite .    of interest in this work",
    "is the situation when @xmath80 . here",
    ", we obtain the low energy spectrum through the following steps .    1 .",
    "we perform exact diagonalization for @xmath81 particles at filling factor @xmath48 in the lowest landau level to get all eigenstate .",
    "the form of the interaction used for the diagonalization is of no significance , because its only role is to produce basis wave functions , but we work with the coulomb interaction .",
    "let us denote these states by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 labels different states .",
    "2 .   we then promote each eigenstate to the @xmath27 landau level , and fill the lower @xmath22 landau levels completely with additional particles to get the @xmath41 particle state at @xmath0 .",
    "this gives _ all _ wave functions @xmath84 for which the lowest @xmath22 landau levels are fully occupied and the next landau level has filling @xmath48 .",
    "these states are denoted by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 denotes addition of @xmath22 landau levels .",
    "it ought to be remembered that the operator @xmath86 changes the number of particles .",
    "3 .   we then multiply each wave function by @xmath87 and carry out the lowest landau level projection by the method discussed above .",
    "this gives us correlated basis functions @xmath88 at @xmath11 .",
    "these steps are summarized as + @xmath89 + @xmath90 + the advantage of constructing basis states in this way is that it directly gives us basis functions with well defined orbital angular momentum @xmath91 , which is a good quantum number in the spherical geometry .",
    "we can work within each @xmath91 sector independently , because they are not coupled by the interaction .",
    "( note that in the above equation , @xmath82 is a wave function for @xmath81 electrons only . )",
    "the basis thus obtained is not orthogonal .",

    "since our goal is to look the feasibility of nqhe described above , we do our calculations at those values of @xmath43 where it is possible for @xmath9cf s in the partially filled level to condense into a standard type of fqhe state . for that",

    ", however , the ratio @xmath97 is not exactly equal to @xmath11 , and the identification of what filling factor a finite system corresponds to requires additional theoretical input .    let us first consider the incompressible states at filling factor @xmath98 , the wave function for which is given by @xmath99 . for these states ,",
    "the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath41 can be obtained by noting that the product of two monopole harmonics at @xmath100 and @xmath101 gives a monopole harmonic at @xmath102 , i.e. the monopole strengths add . for reasons that will become clear below ,",
    "let us denote the number of particles by @xmath103 and the monopole strength by @xmath104 .",
    "the lowest ll projection is unimportant for the question of the relationship between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , as it does not alter @xmath104 . in the spherical geometry ,",
    "for monopole strength @xmath105 the degeneracy of the lowest landau level is @xmath106 , for the next ll it is @xmath107 , and so on . from that , it is clear that the @xmath33 filled ll state is obtained for @xmath108 given by @xmath109 in particular , one filled ll is obtained at @xmath110 from the addition rule , the monopole strength of @xmath99 is given by @xmath111 it can be verified that @xmath112 gives the filling factor @xmath113 in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "when the ground states has @xmath171 , there is no well defined cf - exciton branch .",
    "the final spectrum at @xmath11 thus bears little resemblance to the spectrum at @xmath113 that we started out with , implying that the interaction between composite fermions in the partially filled level is quite different from that of electrons at @xmath113 in the lowest landau level .",
    "the scenario described in the introduction for nqhe is thus not borne out .",
    "the ground states at the flux values considered above are in general not incompressible uniform states with @xmath171 .",
    "consider 4/11 for example .",
    "it has been known @xcite that for @xmath39 particle system at @xmath185 , which is identified above with 4/11 , the ground state does not have @xmath171 . however , the system is effectively very small here , with only @xmath186 composite fermions in the second level , and one may question if the conclusion will hold up as @xmath41 increases .",
    "we find that for @xmath44 and 20 the ground state has @xmath171 , but for @xmath187 and 24 it does not .",
    "this provides an illustration for why a study of several values of @xmath41 is crucial ; if one had only studied @xmath44 , that would have led one to exactly the opposite conclusion .",
    "another example is the 12 particle system at 6/17 , which has an @xmath171 ground state and might suggest fqhe at 6/17 ; however , the spectra for @xmath188 and 24 at 6/17 explicitly clarify that this is only a finite size effect that does not survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our study implies that even though the ground state sometimes has @xmath171 , it does _ not _ describe an incompressible state at any of the filling factors considered here .",
    "the following observations support this statement :    1 .   when the ground state has @xmath189 , the @xmath171 state is a rather highly excited state .",
    "2 .   in the plot of the ground state energy with @xmath190 , the energies of the @xmath171 ground states are not particularly low . see fig .",
    "( [ fig14 ] ) for 4/11 . 3 .",
    "the ground state at @xmath113 generally produces an excited state at @xmath11 , even in the @xmath171 sector ( prior to orthogonalization ) , which indicates a breakdown of analogy between @xmath113 and @xmath11 .",
    "the energy per particle is not a smooth function of @xmath190 , but instead shows fluctuations characteristic of a compressible state .",
    "see fig .",
    "( [ fig14 ] ) . 5 .",
    "it is not inconceivable for a compressible state to have @xmath171 , because a uniform state avoids hartree energy cost , but it would be difficult to understand how an incompressible state might have @xmath189 .    as a result , the physical mechanism , in which some of the composite fermions turn into higher order composite fermions and condense into landau levels to exhibit qhe , does not appear to be relevant for fully spin polarized electrons .",
    "the interaction between composite fermions in the second level is thus not of a form to produce nqhe .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that the results do _ not _ rule out nqhe through some hitherto unknown mechanism , which would imply a different relation between @xmath42 and @xmath41 for a given filling factor than the one assumed above .    in ref .",
    ", which also investigated some of the above fractions , it was predicted that the ground state is a bubble crystal of composite fermions , similar to what was found in hartree fock studies of corresponding electronic states in higher landau levels@xcite . aside from several approximations , the results of that study were also predicated upon the quantitative validity of certain trial wave functions , making an independent confirmation worthwhile .",
    "unfortunately , the spherical geometry used here is not convenient for the study of charge density wave states .",
    "we do note in passing that a crucial step in ref .   was to model the states at @xmath191 in terms of fermions at @xmath113 with an effective two - body interaction . a close similarity between our fig .",
    "( [ fig9 ] ) and fig .",
    "( 5 ) of ref .  , obtained from the two - body interaction model [ both for @xmath192 provides support to the validity of this model .    in the end",
    ", we note that the above calculations assume a strictly two dimensional system ( with zero width ) , no disorder , and no mixing with higher electron landau levels .",
    "these approximations represent an idealization of the actual experimental system .",
    "it is expected that the idealized model , while not accurate _ quantitatively _",
    ", should give the correct qualitative behavior .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge partial support by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "we are grateful to horst stormer , wei pan , and chia - chen chang for valuable discussions , to david weiss for suggesting the name `` nqhe , '' to the high performance computing ( hpc ) group led by v. agarwala , j. holmes , and j. nucciarone , at the penn state university aset ( academic services and emerging technologies ) for assistance and computing time with the lion - xe cluster , and acknowledge nsf dge-9987589 for computer support .",
    "we warn the reader that the assignment of filling factor to a finite system involves physical interpretation , and therefore must be treated with caution .",
    "the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath42 at filling factor @xmath11 must have the form @xmath193 , where @xmath83 is of oder unity , so as to produce the correct filling factor in the limit @xmath95 ( @xmath194 ) , but the value of @xmath83 , which is crucial for finite systems , depends on the physics of the incompressible state . in this paper ,",
    "the filling factor is attributed to a finite system assuming the familiar physics that has been successful in explaining the fractions @xmath195 . a different origin of incompressibility",
