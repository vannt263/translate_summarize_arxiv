    "due to their low luminosities and sizes , a detailed classification of dwarf ( @xmath0 ) galaxies is not easy , thus leading to a deceptively simple picture : those objects showing conspicuous signatures of present / recent star formation and interstellar material are called dwarf irregulars ( di ) , while the remaining smooth - looking , gas - poor objects fall within the dwarf elliptical ( de ) designation .",
    "however , there is growing evidence for a morphological diversity among dwarfs ; in particular , embedded disc structure and/or rotation were discovered within a fraction of des @xcite , which seems to favor the idea that a fraction of the des may be remnants of `` harassed '' disc galaxies @xcite . whether these objects are related to the still poorly known class of dwarf lenticulars ( ds0 ) or not , is still matter of debate @xcite .",

    "we were able to assign any individual group member into one of the following classes :    de : : :    a srsic law @xcite gives very good fits to their sbps .",
