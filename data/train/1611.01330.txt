    "activity of brain regions @xcite , car flow on roads @xcite , meta - population epidemic @xcite , all these arguably very different systems have in common that they can be represented as the activity of a quantity of interest on the nodes of a network .",
    "the coupling between the dynamics on the nodes and their network of interactions often leads to emergent collective states . in simple cases , such as the kuramoto and @xmath0 spin models",
    ", these macroscopic states can be classified according to the behaviour of an order parameter that measures the global coherence of the units comprising the system .",
    "unfortunately , this order parameter is blind to the structure of the underlying interaction network , and does not allow to investigate how the system behaves at different structural scales . to gain a better understanding of the effect of network structure on its activity , we need a method to characterise a macroscopic state that combines both aspects . having such a method will then help us to understand the functioning and mitigate disruption of complex systems or even engineer new ones .    in this paper , we consider the problem in the spectral domain by exploiting tools from temporal graph signal analysis .",
    "in particular , we show that the collective patterns of a dynamical system can be robustly characterised by decomposing its nodal activity in an adequate basis associated to its _ structural properties_.    to illustrate our method , we will study the @xmath0 spin model on complex networks .",
    "spin models are paradigmatic examples of systems where pairwise interactions give rise to emergent , macroscopic stationary states .",
    "historically , the behaviour of these models was studied on lattices , but other types of topologies have been considered in recent years and , in particular , researchers have investigated the effect of the topology on equilibrium and out of equilibrium states .",
    "remarkably , a new stationary state has been observed on complex networks in addition to the well - known non - magnetised and magnetised states : the supra - oscillating state , in which magnetisation coherently oscillates indefinitely @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these three states can be found on several network models , which suggests that the topology constrains the xy spins in a given phase .",
    "although it is possible to analytically connect the parameters of the network models to thermodynamics in some simple situations @xcite , the nonlinearity of the interactions in the @xmath0 model complicates the construction of a direct , general theory linking the underlying network topology and the phenomenology .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop a framework that links the structure to the dynamics .",
    "we are in a situation where different topologies give rise to the same macroscopic states , and thus in a perfect setting to explore the interplay between structure and dynamics , using a network theoretical approach .",
    "as we are studying a global emergent property of a system , it is natural to seek a description that uses system - wide features of the underlying network . to explore the relationship between the structure of the network and the evolution of the individual spins , we leverage the spectral properties of networks and use the temporal graph signal transform ( tgst ) .",
    "temporal graph signal transform is an extension to time series of the graph signal transform , a method introduced in @xcite for static signals on complex networks .",
    "we use tgst to decompose the time series of the spins in the laplacian eigenbasis , which carries information about the structure of the network .",
    "graph signal transform in different forms has already been applied in the context of signal analysis such as fmri time series @xcite or image compression @xcite as well as graph characterization and community detection @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature of the tgst , which explains its power and versatility , is its ability to analyse data on irregular domains such as complex networks .    by using tgst",
    ", we can quantify the importance of each eigenmode by computing the spatial power spectrum .",
    "we find that irrespective of the specific topology , the functional form of the power spectrum characterises a state .",
    "this clearly shows that a selection of modes is at play . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the @xmath0 dynamics resonates with specific graph substructures , leading to the same macroscopic state .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we briefly introduce the @xmath0 spin model in sec .",
    "[ subsec : model ] along with the several macroscopic behaviours it displays on networks in sec .",
    "[ subsec : phenomena ] ; we then proceed by introducing the general framework of the graph signal transform in sec .",
    "[ subsec : gst ] and finally present and discuss our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 spin model , a well known model in statistical mechanics , on various network topologies . in this model ,",
    "the dynamics of the spins is parametrised by an angle @xmath1 and its canonically associated momentum @xmath2 .",
    "each spin @xmath3 is then located on a network vertex and interacts with the spins in @xmath4 , the set of vertices connected to @xmath3 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads : @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the average degree of the network .",
    "the dynamics is given by the following hamilton s equations : @xmath9 as we are in the microcanonical ensemble , the energy @xmath10 ( eq .  ) is conserved along with the total momentum @xmath11 which itself is conserved because of the translational invariance of the system .    in order to determine the amount of coherence in the system , we define the order parameter @xmath12 , where the magnetization @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 in the stationary state , it is possible to measure @xmath15 , where the bar stands for the temporal mean . in the magnetised phase ,",
    "all rotors point in the same direction and @xmath16 , while in the non - magnetised phase there is no preferred direction for the rotors and @xmath17 .",
    "our choice of the @xmath0 model was motivated by the variety of macroscopic behaviours displayed when the rotors interact on a complex network at low energies .",
    "we now briefly recapitulate this phenomenology in order to give the background upon which the present work is based .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath0 model on complex networks has been explored in ref .",

    "the lace network model is a variant of the ws network model with an additional constraint on the rewiring process . in the following",
    "we will review the behaviour of the @xmath0 spin model on the three network models we considered , see table  [ tab : topo_phases ] for a summary of the topological conditions for each phase to exist .    [",

    "by contrast , a magnetised phase is observed for @xmath25 and low energies densities , i.e. @xmath26  @xcite . for @xmath27 ,",
    "a highly oscillating state emerges , in which the order parameter @xmath28 is affected by persistent macroscopic fluctuations ( fig .",

    "these fluctuations are persistent over time : they have been observed in simulations up to 10 times longer than the usual relaxation to equilibrium time .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that they are not due to finite - size effects : the fluctuations can not be tamed by increasing the system size as their variance displays a remarkable stability across different system sizes @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this state as supra - oscillating state .",

    "interestingly , it is not possible to observe the supra - oscillating state on a ws network between @xmath31 and @xmath32 as in the case of the @xmath18-regular graph , for any value of @xmath30 .",
    "even a small amount of unconstrained randomness has a homogenizing effect on the dynamics , making the potential the parameter space in which the supra - oscillating state could live is extremely small and precludes its observation in practice .    [",

    "this additional constraint enables the network to retrieve the supra - oscillating state that disappears for ws networks . for @xmath33 , a rewiring probability @xmath34 exists above which the supra - oscillating phase sets in . the non - magnetised and magnetised phases are separated by the same probability @xmath34 for @xmath35 , as long range interactions are needed to keep the system in the magnetised phase . in the @xmath36 case , the rewiring range is too short to allow the emergence of a coherent state .",
    "finally , we note that the probability @xmath37 depends on the size of the network , as it is related to an effective `` network dimension '' @xcite .",

    "it is therefore natural to use structural information about the underlying network to characterise each phase . to disentangle the relationship between the structure and the macroscopic behaviour induced by the dynamics",

    "let us suppose that we have a static , undirected graph @xmath52 in which the state of the nodes change over time .",
    "the activity of node  @xmath3 at time @xmath53 is denoted by the scalar variable @xmath54 and the state of the system is represented by the vector @xmath55 .",
    "when the activities of the nodes are coupled , it is then convenient to use a @xmath56-matrix @xmath57 , whose @xmath58-element describes the interaction between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath59 , such that the evolution of @xmath60 can be written in all generality as @xmath61 .    let us furthermore suppose that the matrix @xmath57 is real and symmetric . by the spectral theorem , @xmath57 has the eigenvectors @xmath62 and their associated eigenvalues @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the graph signal transform consists in projecting the activities @xmath65 at time @xmath53 onto the set of eigenvectors @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath3-th component of @xmath66 .",

    "the laplacian @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 , where is @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the degree of node @xmath3 .",
    "the choice of interaction matrix , and its associated eigenbasis for tgst , can in principle be chosen freely by the user , even if the linear operator associated to the underlying dynamics will be preferred if the latter is known .",
    "for example , oscillators interacting on networks via diffusive coupling are governed by the laplacian @xmath72 .",
    "it is therefore natural to use the the eigenbasis of the laplacian to investigate the synchronization phenomena of coupled oscillators such as the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "examples of such analysis include the master stability function analysis of the synchronous states @xcite , the effects of network structure on synchrony @xcite , and the synchrony of non - identical oscillators @xcite . in this study , we used the laplacian eigenbasis to decompose the time series of the spins in the three states of the xy - model , even though the laplacian operator is a good approximation of the dynamics only in the magnetised states .",
    "as we obtained compelling results for all phases , this indicates that the tgst approach is versatile and a powerful and generic tool to analyse time series on networks .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning the analogy between gst and the discrete spatial fourier transform that is evident from eq .",
    "[ eq : gst_x ] : each eigenvector @xmath66 represents a specific weighted node structure associated to the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath76 , that can be interpreted as a length , in the same way that each fourier mode is associated to a wave of specific wavelength .",
    "with this parallel in mind , a small eigenvalue is associated to a long wavelength ; the extreme example being the first eigenvalue that corresponds to the connectedness of the network . due to the possible degeneracy of the eigenvalues ,",
    "it is in general not possible to establish a bijection between the `` wavelength '' , i.e. , the eigenvalue , and the `` wave '' , i.e. , the eigenvector .",
    "this is for example the case for @xmath18-regular graphs that have very high symmetries ( see section  [ subsec : excitation ] ) .",
    "we also note that as the eigenvalues of the laplacian satisfy @xmath77 , the eigenvalues are naturally ordered by decreasing `` wavelength '' .",

    "this integrating scheme allows us to check the accuracy of the numerical integration ; we verified at each time step that the conserved quantities of the system , energy @xmath10 and total momentum @xmath81 are effectively constant over time .",
    "once the network topology and the size @xmath39 are fixed , we monitor the average magnetization @xmath84 for each energy @xmath85 in the physical range .",
    "we compute the temporal mean @xmath15 on the second half of the simulation , after checking that the magnetization has reached a stationary state and only use this part of the simulations in our analyses .",

    "[ fig : spectra_powa_across ] .",
    "we observe that the power spectra for each state are strikingly similar for the different topologies .",
    "this shows that the spatial power spectrum is driven by some specific substructures , that are must be common to all networks on which the dynamics is run .",
    "+ _ magnetised _ the laplacian spectrum for the @xmath18-regular graph is highly degenerated , reflecting the regularity of the network , while the spectra for the ws and the lace networks are very similar , showing similar structure and non - degeneracy due the the random rewiring .",
    "the power spectra are unsurprisingly largely dominated by the first eigenvalue as it represents the constant component of the signal which dominates as the magnetisation is essentially constant .",
    "while the spectra for the lace and ws networks are very close , the spectra for the @xmath18-regular network is very different , strengthening our point that specific substructure , potentially independent of the network model considered drive the macroscopic dynamics .",
    "+ _ non - magnetised _ this state is akin to a random state , as the spins only weakly interact and no long - range order is present .",
    "this is directly reflected by the small contributions from all eigenmodes , as there is barely an order of magnitude difference between the largest and smallest amplitudes .",
    "the contribution of the eigenvalues decay exponentially , and the spectra for the three network models are very similar , the lace and ws spectra are even quasi overlapping .",
    "+ _ supra - oscillating _ the power spectrum signature of the state , that only exists for the @xmath18-regular and lace network is the most interesting . the fat tail and its seemingly power law decrease hints to a notion of hierarchy in the spatial modes that explain the non tameable oscillating patterns , as the magnetisation is eventually a result of the superposition of all the spatial modes .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the contribution of the eignenmodes decreases with the eigenvalues , they do so non - monotonically .",
    "we investigate this phenomena in the next section .",
    "the ws and lace networks have an element of randomness in their construction .",
    "it is therefore crucial to verify that the properties of the spectra and power spectra we observed in the previous section are not accidental , but genuinely representative of a class of networks .",
    "we generated @xmath95 realisations of the two types of networks in each state they can support , see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_powa_stat ] .",
    "the spectra of the laplacians are remarkably consistent , as shown by the small error bars .",
    "this small magnitude of the variability of the eigenvalues across realisations justifies the averaging of the power spectra across realisations .",
    "it is remarkable that this variance , affecting particular structures of the networks , does not have any effect on the power spectra , as they are all very consistent with low variance , except for some noise at the beginning of the power spectra .",
    "the emerging macroscopic properties are not affected by the local differences induced by the variance and the structural differences between the lace and ws , that make lace networks support the supra - oscillating state and not the ws , are robust to the noise that is introduced by different realisations of the same network model .",
    "earlier , we pointed out the non - monotonic decrease of the eigenmodes amplitude with the eigenvalues , on top of a clear overall decreasing trend . on the one hand , these fluctuations could be due to stochastic effects of particular network realisation which are ironed out when an ensemble average is taken . on the other hand , they could be genuine and due solely to the dynamics . to investigate the cause of these fluctuations",
    ", we averaged the power spectra for the different realisation of lace networks , and observe that both scenarios happen .",
    "in the case of the magnetised and supra - oscillating states , the curves becomes very smooth and decreases monotonically , and the non - magnetised power spectrum remains intrinsically noisy .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , as the first two states contain some degree of order and even a handful of realisations are enough to even out the fluctuations . on the contrary ,",
    "the behaviour of the spins in the non - magnetised state is essentially uncorrelated .",
    "this randomness is heightened by the randomness inherent to the generation of the lace networks , and the power spectrum strongly carries the mark of this structural randomness , contrary to the case of the two other states , where the temporal structure , induced by underlying network structure , is enough to cancel the variations in the structure . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : powa_spectra_size_lace ] , we present evidence that the power spectral signatures for the lace networks are not due to finite size effects .",
    "the shape of the power spectra and the relative importance of the eigenmodes are consistent for networks of sizes @xmath96 .",
    "in this paper , we presented the temporal graph signal transform , a method to decompose time dependent signals living on the nodes of a network , using a basis that incorporate structural information .",
    "we applied tgst to the time series of the spins of the @xmath0 spin model in its three possible macroscopic states on three different network topologies .",
    "we found clear spatial power spectral signatures that characterise each state .",
    "importantly , these signatures are robust across topologies and to structural variability in different realisations of the watts - strogatz and lace networks . in all cases ,",
    "the power spectra are dominated by small eigenvalues , that correspond to larger structures .",
    "the shape of the power spectra and their decrease reflect the behaviour of the macroscopic magnetisation of the three states in fig .",
    "[ fig : macro - states ] : the only significant contribution of the magnetised state is the constant eigenvector ; the non - magnetised state is also dominated the constant eigenvector , but there are non negligible contribution from higher modes , whose power decays exponentially .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that in the non - magnetised state , the spins oscillate in a random fashion .",
    "finally , the power spectrum of the supra - oscillating state displays a power law like decay , hinting that a hierarchy of modes exists and elucidating the origin of this state .",
    "these results offer a new avenue to characterise not only macroscopic states in statistical mechanics models but also the behaviour of real world system .",
    "this technique is powerful enough to circumvent traditional problems such as the need to use finite size scaling to take into account finite size effects .",
