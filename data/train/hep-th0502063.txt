    "the result of semi - classical quantization of long spinning strings in anti de sitter space is that the energy @xmath5 scales with the spin @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( for large @xmath6 ) .",
    "this result , which is independent of the dimensionality of anti de sitter space , was originally obtained a decade ago by considering fluctuations around the string center of mass @xcite .",
    "it holds even classically , as was immediatly shown by considering rigidly rotating strings @xcite , and is due to the constant curvature of anti de sitter space .",
    "these findings have recently received a lot of attention in connection with the conjectured duality @xcite between super string theory on @xmath8 and @xmath9 su(n ) super yang - mills theory in minkowski space . in the case of rigidly rotating strings ,",
    "it was noticed @xcite that the subleading term is logarithmic in the spin @xmath6 @xmath10 which is essentially the same behavior as found for certain operators on the gauge theory side @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath6 relationship has been further investigated in a number of papers including @xcite for various string configurations .",
    "more recently it was discovered that multi spin solutions could also be constructed easily @xcite . among others ,",
    "a relatively simple solution was found in @xmath2 describing a string which is located at a point in the radial direction , winding around an angular direction and spinning with equal angular momentum in two independent planes . in the long string limit",
    "it was shown that @xmath11 multi spin solitons in @xmath0 have been further investigated in a number of papers including @xcite .",
    "however , most of these papers have dealt with multi spin solutions in the @xmath1 part of @xmath0 .",
    "the main problem with all these multi spin solutions , is that they tend to be classically unstable for large spin .",
    "for instance , the simple two - spin solution leading to ( [ eq1.2 ] ) is only stable for @xcite    @xmath12    this means , strictly speaking , that the result ( [ eq1.2 ] ) can not be trusted , since it was derived under the assumption that @xmath13 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that pulsation improves the stability properties for multi spin string solitons .",
    "more precisely , we take the simple two - spin string solution in @xmath2 @xcite , couple it with pulsation in @xmath1 and consider small perturbations around it .",
    "we show that this solution has better stability properties than the non - pulsating one .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , we give a short review of the pulsating two - spin solution in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a general discussion of perturbations , and in section 4 we derive the equations of motion for the physical perturbations around the pulsating two - spin solution . in section 5 , we solve the equations analytically for a few tractable cases , while leaving numerical analysis of the general case for section 6 .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we set our conventions and notations , and review the pulsating two - spin string soliton @xcite .    we have altogether for @xmath0 , the line - element @xmath14 the t hooft coupling in this notation is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the string tension .",
    "the radius of @xmath1 is @xmath17 .    in the standard parametrisation of @xmath18",
    "we have the ranges @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 $ ] , but here we shall use the alternative ranges @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 $ ] .    we take the polyakov action @xmath25 using the conformal gauge @xmath26 where dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to the world - sheet coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , such that the equations of motion are @xmath29 the ansatz for the pulsating two - spin string soliton is @xmath30 where @xmath31 are arbitrary constants .",
    "this is a circular string in @xmath2 , spinning in two different directions .",
    "it is also a circle in @xmath1 , but pulsating there .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 equations become @xmath34 @xmath35 while the non - trivial conformal gauge constraint is @xmath36 the @xmath33 equation and constraint are solved by @xmath37 where @xmath38 notice that ( [ 2.7 ] ) is equivalent to the equation for a simple plane pendulum .",
    "it means that we have two types of motion , and a limiting case .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath39 the string oscillates on one hemisphere , for @xmath40 it starts at one of the poles and approaches the equator for @xmath41 , while for @xmath42 it oscillates between the poles .    the energy @xmath5 and",
    "the 2 spins @xmath43 are easily computed @xmath44 for short strings ( say @xmath45 ) we get @xmath46 such that @xmath47 which inserted into @xmath5 gives @xmath48 for @xmath49 we get @xmath50 which to leading order is just the minkowski result @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath40 we get @xmath52 and for @xmath53 @xmath54 for long strings ( say @xmath55 ) we get @xmath56 now we have to distinguish between different cases .",
    "if @xmath57 , we get from ( [ 2.12 ] ) @xmath58 such that @xmath59 which , when inserted into ( [ 4.15 ] ) , gives @xmath60 this result is valid for @xmath61 , and therefore holds in particular for @xmath49 and @xmath40 .",
    "notice also that the pulsation only gives a contribution to the non - leading terms , in this limit . on the other hand , if @xmath62 we get from eq.([2.12 ] ) @xmath63 such that @xmath64 and insertion into ( [ 4.15 ] ) gives @xmath65 which holds for @xmath66 .",
    "thus , in this limit , the pulsation completely changes the scaling relation .",
    "for @xmath49 all the results of this section reduce to those obtained in @xcite , but are otherwise quite different .",
    "the main problem is that the string soliton is generally not stable .",
    "for @xmath49 it was shown in @xcite that there is only stability for @xmath12 the purpose of the following sections is to find the condition for stability for arbitrary @xmath67 .",
    "there are many ways to discuss the perturbations around string solitons .",
    "one way is to use the nambu - goto action    @xmath68    and make variations @xmath69 to obtain @xmath70 , immediately fixing two of them so as to take care of the gauge invariance .",
    "this is the most often used method in recent papers .",
    "the disadvantages are that it is not world - sheet covariant , and that the kinetic energy terms for the perturbations usually come out in a very complicated form .",
    "another way is to take the polyakov action in conformal gauge ; i.e. , one makes a variation of ( [ 22 ] ) and two variations of ( see @xcite ) @xmath71 this approach is also used in many papers , but the problem here is that one can not usually solve the variation of ( [ 22 ] ) , making it is very difficult to separate the physical and unphysical perturbations .    here",
    "we will use the polyakov action ( [ 23 ] ) ; i.e. , make two variations @xmath69 and @xmath72 . to ensure that we have purely physical perturbations",
    ", we shall consider only perturbations which are normal to the string world - sheet .",
    "this approach is in general world - sheet covariant , and we will eventually get the kinetic energy terms in a very simple form ( see @xcite ) .    first introduce 8 normal vectors to the world - sheet ( @xmath73 ) fulfilling @xmath74 as well as the completeness relation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the induced metric on the world - sheet .",
    "then define the second fundamental form and normal fundamental form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 is a basis for spacetime ( at least locally ) , we can write @xmath81 the @xmath82 are just reparametrisations , and it can then be shown that the @xmath83 fulfil the equations ( see @xcite )    @xmath84    where we introduced @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the covariant derivative with respect to the polyakov metric .",
    "as the unperturbed string we take the pulsating two - spin solution in @xmath0 from section 2 .",
    "that is , @xmath87 as well as @xmath88 the tangent vectors are @xmath89 @xmath90 the induced metric on the world - sheet is @xmath91 there are 8 normal vectors @xmath92 fulfilling eqs.([430])-([431 ] ) .",
    "they can be chosen as @xmath93 notice that the first 3 only have components in @xmath2 , while the last 3 only have components in @xmath1 .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute the second fundamental form , the normal fundamental form and the projections of the riemann tensor , appearing in ( [ 440 ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "they are listed in the appendix .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to write down the equations ( [ 440 ] ) for the perturbations    @xmath94 } { ( h^2r_0 ^ 2+\\sin^2\\theta)^2}\\ \\phi^4\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{h^2r_0 ^ 2[(2 - 2h^2r_0 ^ 2 + 2h^2c_0 ^ 2)\\sin ^2\\theta -\\sin^4\\theta]}{(h^2r_0 ^ 2+\\sin^2\\theta)^2}\\ \\phi^4=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath95    to solve eqs.([4.13])-([4.20 ] ) , we make fourier expansions @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "we also insert the explicit solution ( [ 2.9 ] ) and define @xmath98 .",
    "the equations are now parametrised by the two dimensionless parameters @xmath99 , where according to eq.([2.10 ] ) @xmath100 .",
    "notice that we have 5 coupled equations for @xmath101 , and 3 decoupled equations for the others .",
    "let us first see what we can say about the 3 identical decoupled equations .",
    "they are given by ( we skip the @xmath102 index ) @xmath103 @xmath104 for @xmath105 , the factor in front of @xmath106 is periodic and positive , making the solution stable .",
    "the @xmath107 mode is just a zero - mode redefining the unperturbed solution .",
    "thus we are left with the first 5 equations .",
    "first we look at the equations in some special limits . for @xmath49 ,",
    "corresponding to no pulsation , we get    @xmath108    the first 3 equations are of course the same as in @xcite , and are stable for @xmath109 .",
    "we are then left with the last two equations which can be written ( we define @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) @xmath112 to have stability we must have that all eigenvalues of the matrix are imaginary .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath113 meaning stability .",
    "the modes corresponding to @xmath114 are zero - modes . in conclusion , for @xmath49 we have stability for @xmath109 , corresponding to spin ( [ 2.12 ] ) @xmath12 in agreement with @xcite .    another special case of importance is @xmath40 , corresponding to a string which starts at one of the poles and approaches the equator for @xmath41 .",
    "unfortunately , the equations do not really simplify in this limit . however , if we only look at the asymtotic equations , we get    @xmath115    it is of course somewhat dangerous to take @xmath41 in the equations , since it corresponds to setting a simple plane pendulum in the vertical upright position , c.f . the comments after eq.([2.10 ] ) .",
    "but we will see that some information can be obtained anyway .",
    "the last equation is solved by trigonometric functions , except for @xmath116 .",
    "we note that @xmath117 are zero - modes , and @xmath107 just gives the expected exponential divergence @xmath118 , which is an artifact of taking @xmath119 in the equations , c.f .",
    "the simple plane pendulum in the vertical upright position .",
    "let us now look at the first 4 equations and apply the method of the previous case @xmath120 where the matrix @xmath121 is @xmath122 again we want to find the condition for which all the eigenvalues @xmath123 are imaginary .",
    "for @xmath124 the characteristic polyomium is @xmath125 we first show that the 3 extrema fall at negative @xmath126 , i.e. that the roots of @xmath127 are negative . for that purpose ,",
    "it is enough to show that the 2 extrema of @xmath128 fall at negative @xmath126 , and that @xmath129 .",
    "we get @xmath130 it is easily seen that both of the solutions of this equation fulfill the requirement for arbitrary @xmath131 .",
    "we then have to look at @xmath128 @xmath132 given that the last three terms are positive , and that the first three can be written as @xmath133 it is seen that @xmath129 .",
    "now we just have to find the condition that @xmath134 , which leads to @xmath135 for @xmath136 , @xmath137 is arbitrary .",
    "for @xmath138 we get @xmath139 , ... , respectively .",
    "thus we end up with @xmath140 , corresponding to the spin @xmath141 indicating , that we have better stability as compared to the @xmath49 case .",
    "there is actually another case where we can solve the equations analytically , namely when @xmath142 . as seen from ( [ 2.10 ] ) and",
    "( [ 2.12 ] ) , this limit corresponds to zero spin , @xmath143 .",
    "we get the equations for @xmath144    @xmath145    and for @xmath146 @xmath147 the first four equations can be shown to lead to oscillating solutions only , ( and zero - modes ) by the same method as used before , so we skip the details .    since the term in front of @xmath148 is periodically minus infinity , the equations for @xmath148 lead to instabilities .",
    "it is not surprising that the pulsating strings become classically unstable for @xmath149 .",
    "notice that the length of the unperturbed string is @xmath150 @xmath149 corresponds to @xmath151 , which gives @xmath152 .",
    "it follows that the string oscillates between its maximal size and zero size .",
    "it is well - known that the classical perturbations blow up when a circular string collapses to a point .",
    "but , of course , the classical approximation can not be trusted in this limit .",
    "given the equations as they stand , eqs.([4.13])-([4.17 ] ) , we have 5 coupled second order ordinary differential equations for the fourier components @xmath153 .    needless to say , except for the few special cases considered in the previous section , any attempts at solving the equations analytically end up being an exercise in futility . the correct way of going about the problem is to solve the equations numerically . in what follows , we first convert the 5 second order ordinary differential equations to 10 first order ordinary differential equations , and then solve them numerically , using an appropriate algorithm . a good safe choice is the classic fourth order runge kutta method for step size @xmath154 .    in order to run this algorithm , we must provide the step size @xmath154 , and the total number of steps , @xmath155 .",
    "in addition to that , we must also supply boundary conditions .",
    "the final data was analysed by printing the 10 graphs for the 5 complex solutions , @xmath156 .",
    "all the aforementioned issues have been dealt with on a trial and error basis .",
    "the step size has been made gradually smaller , until there were no noticeable changes in the output , i.e. , no changes on the fifth decimal place . in terms of @xmath155",
    ", we looked at the graphs and determined , that roughly after 100000 points , it was clear whether the functions diverged or not .    ideally , the stability of the equations should be tested for an infinite number of possible boundary conditions , but since that is impossible , we have had to content ourselves with being able to only check a limited number of boundary conditions for the solutions .",
    "we have not made a major issue out of it , and have only varied the boundary conditions for a couple of stable and unstable solutions .",
    "this minor analysis showed , in terms of the behaviour of the functions for large @xmath27 , total insensitivity to varying the boundary conditions . given that we are dealing with complex functions",
    ", we have chosen finite different complex boundary conditions around unity for all the functions .",
    "we now turn to the numerical results . for each @xmath157",
    "we integrate the 5 second order equations for @xmath158 , to determine whether we have stability or not .",
    "typically we have stability up to a critical @xmath137 , beyond which we have instability .",
    "an example is shown in figures 1 and 2 , for @xmath159 . in this case",
    "we have stability up to @xmath160 , and instability from @xmath161 , which in terms of the spin is @xmath162 to find the critical @xmath137 which separates the stable and unstable solutions , we now let @xmath67 and @xmath163 run .",
    "the corresponding critical spin @xmath6 , obtained from ( [ 2.12 ] ) , is plotted as a function of @xmath67 in figure 3 .    for @xmath164 we found ,",
    "analytically , that the modes @xmath165 are either zero - modes or stable .",
    "this turns out to hold for arbitrary @xmath67 .",
    "we also saw in the same cases that @xmath166 was the most unstable mode .",
    "this also turns out to be the case for arbitrary @xmath67 ; see again figure 3 .",
    "more precisely , in figure 3 , we show the maximal spin for which we have stability as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "we only show the curves for the modes @xmath167 , just to show that @xmath166 is the most unstable mode , as already mentioned .",
    "the numerical results are of course in agreement with the analytical results for @xmath168 , and from figure 3 we can then finally conclude that the inclusion of pulsation leads to better stability . in other words , the more pulsation we have ( the higher @xmath67 ) , the higher spin we can allow and still have stability .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that when we include pulsation in @xmath1 @xcite , the resulting string solution has better stabillity properties than the original two - spin string solution in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if pulsation could also improve the stabillity properties of the multi r - charge solutions in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the equations for the perturbations become even more complicated than our eqs.([4.13])-([4.20 ] ) , meaning that the analysis will demand extensive numerical work . : + we would like to thank n. sibani for secretarial help , and l. glazov for help with the numerical work .",
