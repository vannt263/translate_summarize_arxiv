    "the cusp problem comes from numerical simulations predicted the formation of divergent density profiles inside virialized dm halos .",
    "however such a behavior of density profiles is not seen in observations .",
    "this contradiction is known as `` the cusp problem '' .",
    "mathematically , this means that in the central part of gravitationally - bounded halos we get the power - law density profile @xmath1 with @xmath2 in numerical simulations ( e.g.   @xcite ) and @xmath3 in observed galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the first case we deal with cusp , in the second one  with core .",
    "in addition , the available observational data show a broad scatter of @xmath4 ( see  @xcite ) and sometimes @xmath5 are observed ( for example , in rich clusters of galaxies  @xcite ) .",
    "majority of the observed rotation curves of galaxies  @xcite are well fitted by the burkert s function with @xmath6 ( see  @xcite ) which differs significantly from the simulated curves fitted by the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) function with @xmath7 , ( @xcite ) .",
    "this situation has created the problem discussed during many years as an important problem of the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "more of that , there is a common myth that the relaxation of collisionless dm particles always produces density cusps .",
    "to clarify the difference between core and cusp we calculate pressure profile for dm halo . for power - law density profile ( [ dprof ] )",
    "we get for the mass of halo @xmath8 and for the pressure , @xmath9 , within an equilibrium halo @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are some constants .",
    "so , if @xmath14 then in the central part of halo the pressure is finite and we have the core case . if @xmath15 then the pressure is infinite what corresponds to the case of cusp .",
    "evidently , @xmath7 is a critical value of @xmath4 corresponding to the logarithmic cusp formation .",
    "the halo formation includes both processes of the reversible matter compression and the irreversible relaxation . to discriminate between them",
    "we will consider the entropy function , @xmath16 .",
    "for the nonrelativistic dm particles with the isotropic pressure it can be introduced as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is one - dimensional random velocity , @xmath19 are the density , concentration and temperature of dm particles .",
    "@xmath20 can be presented as a function of current radius of halo , @xmath21 , but it is more convenient to consider @xmath20 as a function of current mass , i.e. mass inside of @xmath21 .",
    "we call @xmath22 by entropy mass function : @xmath23 @xmath24 for the critical value of @xmath7 we get @xmath25 .",
    "the entropy mass function integrates the impact of irreversible processes during all dm evolution and determines the profile of relaxed halo .",
    "as is seen from ( [ beta12 ] ) for @xmath26 we have @xmath27 and , so , @xmath28 for @xmath29 . however , the fraction of low entropy dm particles in the central regions of halo in the cusp case is larger than that in the case of core .",
    "the discussions of the halo formation are usually concentrated around the processes of dm relaxation which are main sources of entropy . at the same time",
    "it is usually accepted that before matter relaxation the dm entropy is negligible . however , in the cdm model there are random correlated velocities down to very small scales determined by the mass of dm particles . in a course of the matter compression they are partly transformed to the temperature of particles and , so , increase the entropy mass function at small @xmath30 .",
    "this effect can be estimated analytically .",
    "further on we will calculate the joint entropy in relaxed dm halos summing the initial entropy given by small scale initial perturbations and an entropy generated during non - linear relaxation of collapsed matter .",
    "our further analysis includes the following steps :    \\1 . instead of density - radius relations we use the entropy - mass profiles .",
    "the mean initial entropy profile , @xmath31 , is estimated as the entropy mass function of linear velocity perturbations .",
    "such identification assumes the almost adiabatic matter compression and , so , partly underestimates the entropy mass function @xmath31 at small @xmath30 .",
    "the entropy generated by the process of relaxation of compressed matter , @xmath32 , is taken from results of n - body simulations ( e.g. nfw profiles ) .",
    "we combine the initial and generated entropies by a simple way to set of joint entropy profiles and reconstruct the circular velocities and resulting density profiles .",
    "at the beginning we need to consider initial field of density perturbations and its statistical properties .",
    "let us characterize the initial conditions in dark matter by three gauge - invariant variables  displacement of a matter point from unperturbed position ( the deviation from hubble flows ) , @xmath33 , the full velocity of matter , @xmath34 , and comoving density perturbation , @xmath35 :    r(z , x ) & = & , + v(z , x ) & = & = h(r + g s ) ,    @xmath36 where the dot and prime mean derivative with respect to the physical time and the function argument , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the eulerian ( shear - free ) and lagrangian ( comoving ) coordinates of a matter point .    in these terms perturbations related with the collapsed halo as whole and conditional perturbations within the halo can be separated as follows :    s(x ) & = & s_r(x ) + s_*(x ) + ( x ) & = & _ r ( x ) + _ * ( x )    where quantities with index @xmath39 are related to a protohalo with a linear size @xmath39 , and quantities with index @xmath40 are related to conditional perturbations which determine the corresponding temperature and entropy of compressed matter , @xmath41 ^ 2dk.\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a usual spherical window function .    after some analytical and numerical calculations we obtain for the power index @xmath43 of initial entropy mass function @xmath22 for @xmath44 ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) :    .power index of the function @xmath45 for halos with @xmath44 . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is easy to see that in all cases @xmath43 is less than its critical value @xmath46 .",
    "this means that initial entropy dominate in central regions of halo what stimulates the formation of cores and suppresses the cusp formation .",
    "the spherical collapse with the violent relaxation of compressed matter have been investigated in many papers .",
    "thus , authors of  @xcite started from initial conditions with no initial velocities and entropy @xmath47 @xmath48 and found that the density profile of relaxed matter , @xmath49 , is approximated at small @xmath21 by power law : @xmath50    the approach was extended in  @xcite where nonradial trajectories of dm particles were also considered .",
    "the density profiles for relaxed halos was found to be similar to previous one .",
    "this problem have also considered in  @xcite for the initial conditions @xmath51 near the center of cloud the power law density profile was found with @xmath52 anywhere initial velocities and entropy was accepted to be equal to zero .    as it is seen from these relations , the model of _ violent relaxation _",
    "leads to the entropy distribution @xmath53 that implies the formation of cusp .",
    "however , in the central regions of halos the entropy generated by this process becomes negligible as compared with the initial entropy .",
    "thus , the influence of former one restricts the central density of halos and prevents formation of cusp  like density profile .",
    "the same conclusion is valid also for the simulated nfs  density profile with @xmath54 which represents the more general model of _ hierarchical _ halo formation .",
    "the drop of these indices as compared with previous ones indicates that in the case the initial entropy is partly allowed for but owing to the small scale cutoff of the simulated power spectra its impact is underestimated as compared with estimates in table 1 .",
    "the shape of rotation curves is determined by sum of initial and generated entropy . to clarify influence both of them we model the joint entropy mass function as follows : @xmath55 where the random factor @xmath56 , measures the relative contribution of the initial entropy for different halos .",
    "now we can calculate rotation curves and compare them with observed and simulated ones .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "1 where the circular velocities , @xmath57 , are plotted versus radius for six models of hierarchal ( @xmath58 , left plot ) and six models of violent ( @xmath59 , right plot ) relaxation processes for initial conditions with @xmath60 and for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "both the velocities and radius are normalized for their values in point of velocity maximum , @xmath63 . the curves are compared with the nfw and burkert ones .    as is seen from this figure",
    ", the rotation curves for our models with @xmath64 and @xmath65 close the gap between the burkert and nfw rotation curves .",
    "so , we can expect that properties of observed curves can be successfully reproduced by our models with suitable parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the scatter of both initial and generated entropies can provides required variations of these parameters and the shape of rotation curves what , in turn , explains variations of observed rotation curves .",
    "let us note also that for low mass halos with @xmath68 and especially @xmath69 all rotation curves with @xmath70 are concentrated nearby the nfw profile .",
    "this fact indicates that probably for dwarf galaxies with @xmath71 the observed rotation curves can be similar to expected ones for the model of hierarchical clustering with the nfw profile .     and @xmath72 ( dashed and solid lines ) .",
    "nfw and burkert fits are plotted by stars and dots , respectively . ]",
    "we conclude , that"
