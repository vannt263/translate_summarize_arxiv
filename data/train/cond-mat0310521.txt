    "translocation of a polymer through a narrow pore in a membrane is important to many biological processes , such as the injection of viral dna into a host , dna packing into a shell during viral replication , and gene swapping through bacterial pili @xcite .",
    "translocation also has practical applications in genetics as in cell transformation by dna electroporation @xcite , and in gene therapy @xcite .",
    "this has inspired a number of recent _ in vitro _",
    "experiments , including the electric field - induced migration of dna through microfabricated channels @xcite , or through an @xmath7-hemolysin protein channel in a membrane @xcite .",
    "experiments are motivated by the possibility to  read - off \" a dna or rna sequence by tracking its passage through a pore @xcite .",
    "translocation of a polymer involves both molecular considerations , such as the shape of the pore channel and its interactions with dna , as well as more macroscopic factors such as the statistics and dynamics of the long polymer .",
    "it is the universal features of the latter which are the focus of this paper . while worming its way through the hole",
    ", the segments of the polymer on each side of the membrane can  explore \" many possible configurations .",
    "the number of allowed configurations actually is least when the polymer is halfway through the hole , presenting an entropic barrier . in this regard translocation resembles other entropically controlled polymer systems , such as polymer trapping in random environments @xcite , dna gel electrophoresis @xcite or reptation @xcite , where the geometry of the obstacles constrains the kinetics of the polymer .",
    "schematic depiction of polymer translocation from the left side of a membrane to its right side .",
    "( throughout the paper we shall follow this convention for the direction of transport . )",
    "the number @xmath1 of the monomer at the hole is denoted the `` translocation coordinate.'',width=264 ]    a number of recent theoretical works have shed light on the translocation process @xcite , which is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ transloc ] .",
    "a single variable @xmath1 representing the monomer number at the pore @xcite indicates how far the polymer has progressed , and is a natural variable for describing this problem . due to its resemblance to the ` reaction",
    "coordinate ' for chemical processes , we call @xmath1 the translocation coordinate . if @xmath1 changes very slowly , such that the polymer segments on both sides of the membrane have time to equilibrate , the mean force acting on the monomer in the hole can be determined from a simple calculation of free energy , and the translocation problem is then reduced to the escape of a ` particle ' ( the translocation coordinate ) over a potential barrier . in the following , we shall refer to this limit as _ brownian translocation _ , but shall demonstrate that the required equilibration is not tenable for long enough polymers .    in many experimental situations the polymers are not very long and the observed behavior strongly depends on the properties of the polymer and the pore .",
    "thus introduction of some specific features into the channel properties @xcite , or into interparticle potential @xcite , may provide qualitative explanations of the observed behavior . while the theoretical understanding of the experiments is growing , we are still quite far from quantitative understanding of many observed features @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we restrict out attention to qualitative features of very long polymers that are independent of the details of the pore or inter - monomer potentials .",
    "consequently , we restrict ourselves to simple models . furthermore , since we are interested in contrasting the behavior of phantom polymers , in which the monomers do not interact with each other , with self  avoiding ones , in which monomers repel each other at short distances , we perform simulations in two  dimensional ( 2d ) space , where such differences are more pronounced .    the reduction of the motion of a large molecule to a single  particle problem ignores the fact that the positions of the monomers have strong correlations @xcite , leading to non - trivial dynamical effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , in a dilute solution of polymers in a good solvent , on time scales shorter than the overall relaxation time of the polymer , the motion of monomers is characterized by _ anomalous _ dynamics @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , such effects are also present in translocation . in a previous work we demonstrated @xcite that the scaling of the translocation times with the number of monomers has a power  law dependence which can not be derived from brownian motion of a particle over a barrier , but rather follows from general scaling considerations . in this work ,",
    "we focus on consequences of anomalous dynamics in the presence of a force .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_brown ] we review the limit of very slow translocation , in which case the problem can be reduced to the brownian motion of a single coordinate .",
    "we demonstrate that the requirement of equilibration breaks down for long polymers , especially in the presence of a force pulling the polymer to one side .",
    "we also demonstrate the importance of how such a force is applied to the polymer , contrasting the cases of a polymer pulled by the end , with one forced into a favorable environment .",
    "lower bounds on the translocation times are obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec_unimpeded ] by comparison with the unimpeded motion of a polymer .",
    "the long time scale for equilibration of a forced polymer is due to its change of shape , e.g. into a stretched sequence of blobs when pulled at one end .",
    "exactly how this change of shape is achieved through transmission of the force from one end to another is explicitly shown in appendix  [ app_oned ] which solves this problem for a one  dimensional ( 1d ) phantom polymer .",
    "our other model system , the self - avoiding two dimensional polymer is discussed in appendix  [ app_twod ] . the bounds from unimpeded motion serve a convenient reference point for discussion of anomalous processes that are described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec_anomal ] .",
    "in particular , we find that the actual translocation times have the same scaling behavior as the lower bounds .",
    "if the translocation process is sufficiently slow , at each stage the statistics of the segments will be governed by the equilibrium boltzmann weight .",
    "if so , the dynamics is constrained to reproduce the corresponding statistics . a simple method to achieve",
    "this is to focus on the translocation coordinate @xmath1 , and to write down a stochastic langevin equation for its evolution .",

    "note that there is a decrease in the number of possible states as the polymer threads the hole , which can be regarded as an entropic barrier . for phantom polymers ( random walks )",
    "@xmath9 is equal to 1/2 , while for self - avoiding polymers it depends on the dimensionality of space . from this free energy",
    ", we can construct a langevin equation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a mobility coefficient indicating how easily the polymer is pulled through the hole . to obtain the correct boltzmann statistics ,",
    "the noise @xmath12 has to be uncorrelated at different times , with a variance equal to @xmath13 .",
    "the advent of optical tweezers has made it possible to manipulate single macromolecules .",
    "a common procedure is to attach latex balls to the end(s ) of a polymer ( such as dna ) , and then to manipulate the balls by optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "while this is not the method commonly used in the translocation experiments , it motivates an interesting extension of the previous calculation .",
    "let us imagine that through an optical tweezer set - up forces @xmath20 and @xmath21 are applied to the two ends of the polymer ( perpendicular to the wall ) , as in fig .",
    "[ transloc ] .",
    "a polymer configuration in which the ends are separated by a distance @xmath22 gets an additional boltzmann weight of @xmath23 . for a gaussian polymer of length @xmath0 ,",

    ", does not change the qualitative form , i.e. , in the presence of the force the free energy acquires a term proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "the above argument can be generalized to a self - avoiding polymer by noting that due to dimensional considerations a force @xmath27 should always appear in the combination @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a characteristic size of the polymer , such as its radius of gyration @xmath30 .",
    "quite generally @xmath31 , with @xmath32 for a _ phantom _ ( non  self  interacting ) polymer , and @xmath33 and 0.59 for self  avoiding polymers in space dimensions @xmath34 and 3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the force to the free energy can thus be written as @xmath35 . when the force is sufficiently strong to deform the polymer into a sequence of blobs ( we shall argue later that this is the relevant regime for translocation ) , the free energy is expected to be linear in @xmath0 , necessitating @xmath36 .",
    "such considerations thus imply a free energy contribution of @xmath37 . in the specific case of translocation , adding up the contributions from the two segments leads to @xmath38.\\ ] ]    the corresponding langevin equation for the translocation coordinate is now @xmath39 where we have absorbed various coefficients into the parameter @xmath40 .",
    "note that the average velocity has a non - linear dependence on the forces ; in the case of @xmath41 growing as @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the translocation time in such a set up should decrease with the applied force as @xmath43 .",
    "note that this expression breaks down for _ small forces _",
    ", where the typical translocation time is controlled by the diffusive fluctuations .",
    "the distinction between weak and strong force regimes has a specific meaning in the context of polymers , and quantified through the scaling combination @xmath44 . for weak forces",
    "this combination is small , and the equilibrium polymer shape is not changed . for strong forces",
    "@xmath45 , and the polymer becomes stretched .",
    "the same division applies to forces that are strong enough to overcome the diffusive character of the translocation coordinate .",
    "a more common situation for translocation is when the environments separated by the membrane are not equivalent , so that the polymer encounters a chemical potential difference between the two sides . in this case",
    ", the leading contribution to the free energy is @xmath46 , and the langevin equation takes the form @xmath47 with @xmath48 . in this case",
    "the average translocation velocity is predicted to be proportional to @xmath49 , leading to typical exit times that scale as @xmath50 for large @xmath49 .",
    "it is possible to envision situations in which the polymer is forced ( or hindered ) by a combination of both a chemical potential difference , and forces applied to the two ends . for the corresponding langevin equation ,",
    "we merely need to add the force contributions in eqs .",
    "( [ dots(f ) ] ) and ( [ dots(mu ) ] ) .    in the experiments of meller _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , translocation is driven by an electric potential difference between the two sides of an artificial membrane suspended in a liquid .",
    "it is commonly assumed that since the conductivity of the liquid is significantly higher than the conductivity of the membrane , the liquid on each side of the membrane is an equipotential .",
    "the voltage drop then occurs only across the membrane , and is experienced only by the ( charged ) monomers moving through the pore @xcite .",
    "if so , the voltage difference is equivalent to the chemical potential difference discussed above .",
    "however , the previous results with force acting only on the end monomers serve as a warning that the results are quite sensitive to where the force is applied to the polymer . it would thus be reassuring to carry out a more precise calculation of the electric field in the vicinity of the pore , and how it acts upon the monomers .",
    "the analytical procedure outlined in this section rests on the assumption that the two polymeric segments have come to equilibrium , so that the corresponding free energy can be used to construct a langevin equation .",
    "the minimal requirement is that the typical translocation time @xmath17 should exceed the equilibration time @xmath51 of a polymer . for a chain of finite size",
    ", it is always possible to achieve this by designing the pore to have a large friction coefficient . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that this is the case applicable to the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the equilibration time of a polymer depends strongly on its length , scaling as @xmath52 . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "the exponent @xmath53 is typically larger than 2 for brownian dynamics of self - avoiding polymers ( and equal to 2 for a phantom polymer ) .    since typical transit times for unforced translocation scale as @xmath54 ,",
    "it is possible to imagine that the formalism may apply to phantom polymers .",
    "indeed there is some evidence of this from numerical simulations @xcite , although with an inexplicably large friction coefficient . the situation becomes worse in the presence of a force ( either imposed by pulling or a chemical potential difference ) , in which case typical translocation times are predicted to be proportional to @xmath0 . in the latter case , the range of applicability of ` brownian translocation ' is even further limited .",
    "since the collective dynamics of the passage of polymer through the pore is hard to treat analytically , as a first step we shall derive _ lower bounds _ on the characteristic time scale .",
    "the key observation is that the restriction that the monomers should sequentially pass through a hole in a membrane can only impede the motion of the polymer .",
    "hence the time scale for the polymer to travel the same distance in the absence of the wall should be a generous lower bound to its translocation time . in this section",
    "we shall thus explore the time scale for unimpeded motion of the polymer in the circumstances of interest .      in the unforced limit ,",
    "the translocating polymer simply goes from one side of the membrane to the other by ` diffusion . ' in the process , the center of mass of the polymer moves a distance of the order of a typical size , say the gyration radius of @xmath30 .",
    "how long does it take for a polymer to move a similar distance without the constraints imposed by the pore and the wall ? in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions , the diffusion constant @xmath55 of a polymer is related to the diffusion constant @xmath56 of a single monomer by @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the time that a polymer needs to diffuse its own radius of gyration scales as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "( this is also the relaxation time of the slowest internal mode of a polymer @xcite , and is called the rouse equilibration time . ) for self  avoiding polymers @xmath59 , and the equilibration time is clearly longer than that obtained for translocation though a hole in the wall assuming brownian translocation .",
    "the rouse time scale of @xmath58 should thus be a lower bound to the correct translocation time .",
    "now consider a polymer that is being pulled by one end .",
    "the regime of interest to us is when the force is strong enough to deform the shape of the polymer .",
    "the equilibrium shape of the polymer is then a stretched sequence of ` blobs ' @xcite .",
    "the number of monomers per blob @xmath60 is such that force acting on it is marginally strong , and obtained from @xmath61 .",
    "the typical size of each blob is thus @xmath62 , while the number of blobs is @xmath63 .",
    "the overall length of the stretched chain is now @xmath64 .",
    "the mobility of the center of the mass of a polymer of length @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath65 , and since there is only a force applied to one monomer , its net velocity scales as @xmath66 .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time is the same as the time scale of the polymer moving a distance of order of its size , and hence behaves as @xmath67 ( the same conclusion is obtained if we start with a globular polymer and then apply the force to one end , and wait until the other end feels the force . )",
    "note that upon approaching the boundary between weak and strong forces at @xmath68 , we regain the equilibration time @xmath58 for unforced polymers .",
    "however , the result in eq .",
    "( [ tau(f ) ] ) is only valid for @xmath69 , since for stronger forces , as we shall see in the specific models described in the next section , the velocity of the monomer ( and hence of the entire chain ) saturates .",
    "unimpeded motion of the pulled polymer thus places a lower bound of @xmath3 on the translocation time , far exceeding the time scale ( @xmath70 ) calculated in the previous section",
    ". it may not be readily apparent how the force applied to one end of the polymer is transmitted to the other end , and why the qualitative picture of blobs presented above is valid .",
    "there is actually one limit in which the problem of pulling a polymer by the end can be solved analytically , and that is for a 1d phantom polymer . in appendix",
    "[ app_oned ] this model and the corresponding analysis are presented in some detail .",
    "it is difficult to come up with an unhindered situation that best resembles the case of a chemical potential difference across a membrane .",
    "absent the restrictions imposed by the membrane , there is now a force that is applied to a single monomer , at the spatial position where the membrane would reside . unlike the previous case ,",
    "the monomer to which the force is applied now changes constantly .",
    "there is thus no incentive for a drastic change in the shape of polymer , and we assume that the scaling of the size remains the same , i.e. @xmath71 , independent of @xmath49 . at each moment there is a force of @xmath72 applied to the entire polymer , as a consequence of which its center of mass should move with a velocity @xmath73 .",
    "we thus conclude that the time for such unhindered motion scales as @xmath74    note that to recover the equilibration time of the unforced polymer we have to set @xmath75 in the above equation . while this is the same scaling form as that of a force applied to the end , it is different from the weak / strong criterion that would have been deduced on the basis of energetics ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the manner in which we introduced the unimpeded version ( as a force , rather than a chemical potential difference . ) nonetheless , we still expect the velocity , and hence the time scale in eq .",
    "( [ tau(mu ) ] ) to saturate for @xmath77 , as explicitly demonstrated for the models considered in the next section .",
    "having established some some ( presumably generous ) lower bounds , we now would like to focus on the true asymptotic dynamics of translocation . given the limitations of analytical studies , the chief tool employed in this section is numerical simulations .",
    "interestingly , we find that the lower bounds obtained in the previous section are actually quite restrictive .      in a previous work @xcite , we made a detailed study of the @xmath0dependence of the mean translocation time .",
    "one of the central conclusions was that in the case of brownian dynamics of a self - avoiding polymer , the translocation time scales as @xmath78 this is of the same order as the equilibration time of a polymer of length @xmath0 , and also demonstrates that the actual exit time scales in the same manner as the bound established in the previous section .",
    "the above @xmath0dependence of @xmath17 is inconsistent with simple diffusion of the translocation coordinate @xmath2 , reflecting the constraints imposed by the collective motion of the entire polymer .",
    "a related situation occurs for the fluctuations of a labeled monomer in space , which are also anomalous and sub ",

    "( this differs from the corresponding motion of a labeled monomer @xcite , which remains anomalous even for a phantom polymer . )",
    "this is consistent with a detailed study of a three  dimensional phantom polymer by chern _",

    "we performed averaging over shorter ranges of @xmath84 and did not see significant differences in the correlation functions . ) secondly , for each value of @xmath81 , we can only include processes whose translocation time exceeds @xmath81 ; consequently , the size of the ensemble decreases with increasing @xmath81 .",

    "however , the assumption of equilibrium must necessarily break down for long enough polymers ; even more drastically when the polymer is pulled to one side by a force .",
    "we argued previously @xcite that the collective motion of the whole polymer slows down the translocation to the extent that the corresponding dynamics is anomalous and sub  diffusive .",

    "in particular , pulling the polymer by one end leads to stretched configurations , and slower overall dynamics , compared to applying a chemical potential difference ( which can modify the densities on the two sides ) . while pulling the polymer by optical tweezers is not the currently favored method for artificial translocation of biopolymers , for potential applications such as decoding the sequence",
    ", it should offer a better controlled procedure ( whether by itself or in conjunction with a voltage difference ) .    to understand the time scales involved in forced translocation",
    ", we initially provided what at first glance appear to be a quite loose lower bounds by analogy to _ unimpeded motion _ of a polymer , i.e. neglecting the constraints imposed by passage of the polymer through a hole in a wall .",
    "we then performed numerical simulations on two model systems : a 1d phantom polymer , and a self  avoiding polymer in 2d .",
    "direct interpretation of the numerical results was made difficult by very large cross  over effects which persist in the length scales of 1001000 monomers accessible to numerical study .",
    "nonetheless , by appealing to the lower bounds found earlier , we concluded that ( rather surprisingly ) the actual translocation times scale in the same way as in the limit of unimpeded motion .",
    "thus the constraints from the collective motion of the whole polymer turn out to be at least as important as those imposed by the requirement of passage through a hole .",
    "the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that in the range of 10 to 100 base pairs , the pulling velocity of single - stranded dna through a nanopore is independent of @xmath0 , but with a non - linear dependence on the applied force . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we briefly speculated whether such behavior may be consistent with anomalies associated with polymeric constraints .",
    "as demonstrated in this paper , such constraints result in time scales ( and hence pulling velocities ) which must depend on @xmath0 for large enough @xmath0 .",

    "we hope that these results encourage further experimental and analytical studies of forced translocation .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to better characterize the manner in which external forces act on the polymer , even in the case of a voltage difference across the membrane .",

    "the monomer at the opposite end does not feel the external force in the beginning , and starts moving with velocity of order @xmath65 after time @xmath17 .",
    "we also performed simulations of unimpeded polymer motion mimicking the translocation set - up , by considering an imaginary membrane located at position @xmath93 which has no effect on the motion of monomers .",
    "the initial configuration was chosen by equilibrating the polymer on one side ( @xmath100 ) , with the first monomer fixed to @xmath93 .",
