    "in evolutionary biology , phylogenetic comparative methods ( pcms ) are commonly applied to analyze trait data for a group of species .",
    "since species share evolutionary history , a good estimate of a phylogenetic tree , which represents the evolutionary relationship , is incorporated in data analysis . in past decades",
    "many comparative methods have been developed under different evolutionary hypotheses .",
    "for instance , the trait of a group of related species may rely on a continuous process ranging from either a single brownian motion @xcite , or brownian motions ( bmv ) @xcite to an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process @xcite or multiple optima , multiple rate of evolution and multiple strength of selection ou process(oumva ) @xcite . for a more comprehensive review of comparative methods",
    ", the reader may refer to @xcite .",
    "recently some pcms have been developed for an advanced study of adaptive evolution in a randomly evolving environment @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the model of correlated evolution which sorely predicts the response trait , the model of adaptive evolution estimates the optimal relationship between two traits . to describe the model for adaptive evolution , we start with describing the evolutionary behavior for the response trait .",
    "let @xmath0 be the trait value of a species at time @xmath1 , @xmath2 be the optimum(evolutionary central tendency ) of @xmath0 , @xmath3 be the rate of adaptation representing the speed of the trait tracking on its optimum , @xmath4 be the rate of evolution of @xmath0 , and @xmath5 be a white noise .",
    "a trait value of a species , @xmath6 is a solution of the following ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath7 several models have been developed and applied widely to analyze trait data adopting further assumptions .",
    "for instance , the work in @xcite adopts equation by assuming that the parameters are all time invariant that is @xmath8 and @xmath9 are all constant in equation ( [ ouevo1 ] ) .",
    "the study in @xcite assumes that multiple optima of @xmath0 occur during the evolutionary process . in this case , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a piecewise constant value on the time interval @xmath12 $ ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the initial time of evolution and @xmath15 is the time length from @xmath16 .",
    "their model is then applied to study the evolution of the body size of _ anolis _ lizard of the northern lesser antillean where each of these small islands supports either one or two species of anoles of different size ( one species is large while the other is small ) .",
    "beaulieu et al .",
    "@xcite extend the models considered in @xcite such that the force parameters , @xmath17 , and rate parameters , @xmath18 , are also allowed to take piecewise constant values on @xmath12 $ ] and the models are applied to study the genome size evolution within a fairly large flowering plant clade .",
    "however , the optimum , @xmath2 , typically is not a constant ( or piecewise ) static parameter .",
    "instead its behavior typically evolves according to another independent ou process given below , @xmath19 where the parameters @xmath20 are the drift and the diffusion coefficients respectively for the optimum dynamics , and @xmath21 is a brownian motion which could be correlated or independent from @xmath5 of eq . .",
    "based on these two ou evolutionary dynamics for the trait and its optimum , the model is called ouou to reflect them .",
    "this model was established in @xcite in order to study the adaptation between body size and tail length of woodcreepers .",
    "a special case of the ouou model is the work in @xcite which considers that the trait follows the ou dynamics of equation , and the optimum of the response trait , @xmath22 , evolves via a brownian motion , i.e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 is time invariant .",
    "the oubm model in turn was applied to study whether the sexual size dimorphism increases with body size when the female is the smaller sex in primates .",
    "the rate of evolution @xmath4 in equation ( [ ouevo1 ] ) measures the changing speed of the trait during its evolutionary process .",
    "a trait @xmath0 described in equation ( [ ouevo1 ] ) may have a large variation when a species has evolved through the entire evolutionary history .",
    "therefore this behavior can not be captured by considering a constant rate of evolution as it has been presumed in the current existing literature . indeed , there are many traits from a group of related species with wide range of the evolutionary rate . for instance , yopak et al .",
    "@xcite studied the variation in the brain organization of sharks .",
    "the widespread variation indicates the significant evolutionary diversity in their brain size and body mass .",
    "in such case , the variation should be captured in a stochastic way . adopting these considerations , we develop and study in this paper the so - called oubmbm and ououbm models , respectively , by treating @xmath4 as a brownian motion with a constant variance coefficient @xmath25 @xmath26 where the acronym oubmbm ( respectively ououbm ) reflects the ou dynamics for the trait , a brownian motion ( respectively ou ) for the optimum and a brownian motion for the rate of evolution .",
    "table 1 summarizes the models of trait evolution building on the general ou process that described by the sde system of equation ( [ ouevo4 ] ) .",
    "[ traitmodels ]    .models for trait evolution developed under the ou process .",
    "parameters in the table were either assumed as of constant values ( 0 is included if the model does not use the parameter ) , piecewise constants value or random variable .",
    "for instance , the ou model in @xcite described the trait evolution using the typical orsntein - uhlenbeck process while the oumva model described the trait evolution under the generalized hansen model @xcite with multiple optimum(@xmath11 ) , multiple rate of evolution(@xmath27 ) and multiple constraining forces(@xmath28 ) , @xmath13 .",
    "the bmv model assumed trait evolved with multiple rate of evolution under the brownian motion @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      next we compare the models employing their corresponding aicc values @xcite where @xmath29 @xmath30 is the associated log - likelihood value , @xmath31 is the number of model parameters and @xmath32 is the number of extant species .",
    "we display the result in figure [ fig_aiccweight ] where the relative support for the models are reported by their corresponding akaike weight @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the difference between the aicc value of the model and the minimal aicc value among the model set .",
    "each horizontal line in figure [ fig_aiccweight ] represents the scaled akaike weights of the models .    for most datasets",
    ", we found that oubmbm model accounts for more akaike weight and happens to be the aicc selected models when compared to the ouou model and the ououbm model .",
    "since the ouou model and the ououbm model only differ at most in one parameter from the oubmbm model , this result can be resulted from the likelihood values where the oubmbm contributes to lower likelihood than the ouou / ououbm .",
    "we further access the bias of parameters for the models of interest .",
    "we also include the oubm model in this section .",
    "we considered to generate data with four different sample sizes of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 using the parameters values of @xmath37 for oubm , @xmath38 for ouou , @xmath39 for oubmbm and @xmath40 for ououbm .",
    "the true regression estimate @xmath41 are set to @xmath42 , and @xmath43 replicates are sampled from this set up with considering of using four different types of tree phylogeny ( 1 ) a star tree where all species are completely unrelated , ( 2 ) a completely balanced tree , ( 3 ) a completely pectinate tree , and ( 4 ) a random tree generate under the birth - death process . hence @xmath44 replicates are generated and the associated parameters are estimated through the mle approach described in section 2 . for each parameter of interest ,",
    "we report the boxplots of parameter estimates @xmath45 , and @xmath46 under each models and different sample sizes ( we combine the tree topology effect in this study ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure s1-s4 ( see supplemental material section ) .",
    "overall , we find that the accuracy for estimating the parameters of interests is improved with increasing the sample size .",
    "the interquartile range(iqr ) shrinks with larger sample size increases for each model .",
    "figure s1 and figure s2 shows that estimation for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , can not achieve satisfactory accuracy because there are many outliers configured in the corresponding boxplots .",
    "focusing on figure s1 , the parameter @xmath47 is in general poorly estimated under the oubm and the oubmbm model .",
    "this situation also occurs for estimating @xmath48 as in figure s2 the parameter estimates become less spread as the sample size increases .",
    "figure s3 and figure s4 show that parameter estimation for @xmath49 and @xmath46 , respectively , are in general good . in figure s3 , ouou model accounts for larger variation in estimating @xmath49 than the oubm model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath49 for the ouou model can be estimated more accurately as the sample size increases . in figure s4",
    ", the ououbm model provides wider iqr than the oubmbm model for estimating the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "we leave a discussion for this in the next session .",
    "in this paper , we developed two models for the adaptive trait evolution and evaluated their performance by analyzing many empirical datasets .",
    "we found that our model oubmbm / ououbm fit better for more datasets than their submodel model ouou when evaluated the performance of fit by the @xmath50-squared values . on the other side , under the likelihood based model selection criterion",
    ", we found that due to the likelihood , the oubmbm model became aicc selected models for most empirical datasets than the ouou and ououbm models . in bias study of parameter , we found that the parameters can not be always estimated accurately under the mle analysis for many datasets . ho and an @xcite and an @xcite described the limitation of the parameter estimation of the bm model described in @xcite and the limitation of the ou model described in @xcite for trait evolution .",
    "they pointed out that since some parameters may not identifiable , the maximum likelihood estimators for trait models could fail to be consistent estimators where the convergence to the true parameter can not be guaranteed .",
    "for the ou model , ho and an @xcite proved that the selection optimum can not be estimated consistently as the tree grows indefinitely . in our framework",
    ", we might encounter the same problem when estimating the parameters for the models of adaptive evolution developed here . to deal with this situation",
    ", we suggest a future study for the models of adaptive evolution under a bayesian paradigm to reduce the estimation difficulty for non - identifiable parameters ( see @xcite for works of comparative methods using a bayesian approach ) .",
    "the simulation paths in figure [ fig1 ] indicated the higher variation of the oubmbm model with respect to the oubm model , and the higher variation of the ououbm model with respect to the ouou model .",
    "it is expected that the oubmbm / ououbm model would provide a better fit than the ouou model for data with wider variation . in the shark dataset",
    ", we demonstrate that the both oubmbm and ououbm models provide a better fit than the ouou model .",
    "the sage source code for solving the moments of @xmath51 and the covariance between the residual @xmath52 , the r source codes for parameter estimation and simulations and the datasets used in this work can be accessed directly at www.tonyjhwueng.info/ououbmsim .",
    "for ououbm model , @xmath53 . solving equation ( [ ouevo5 ] ) amounts to calculate the exponential @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath54 has three distinct eigenvalues @xmath55 with eigenvectors set @xmath56 .",
    "this yields that the term @xmath57 can be computed straightforwardly by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the diagonal matrix and @xmath60 is the matrix of eigenvectors .",
    "since the white noises @xmath61 have expectation zero , the expected value of @xmath51 can be determined given the initial condition @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , the expecated value of @xmath0 conditioned on the initial value @xmath63 has the form @xmath64 & = c_{y_t } y_0 + c_{\\theta_t } \\theta_0   \\label{expect_y_0 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ".    then we can apply equation ( [ expect_y_0 ] ) to @xmath0 conditioned on any ancetral value , that is @xmath67= c_{y_t } y_a + c_{\\theta_t } \\theta_a$ ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the ancetral value at @xmath70 . in @xcite , the associated covariance of a pair of traits @xmath71 for species @xmath72 , @xmath73 that diverged at time @xmath74 and evolved independently thereafter is given by @xmath75=cov[e[y_i|y_a],e[y_i|y_a]]$ ] where @xmath76 = e^{-\\alpha_y t_ij/2 } y_a + \\frac{\\alpha_y}{\\alpha_y-\\alpha_\\theta}\\left(e^{-\\alpha_\\theta t_{ij}/2}-e^{-\\alpha_y t_{ij}/2}\\right)\\theta_a$ ] and @xmath77 is the evolutionary distance since species @xmath72 and @xmath72 diverged .    to complete the calculation of @xmath75 $ ]",
    ", the next step is to calculate the terms @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these term can be determined by solving the ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in equation ( [ pt ] ) .",
    "notice that although there are @xmath80 odes in eq .",
    "( [ pt ] ) , due to symmetry of @xmath81 it suffices to solve six equations ( including the three equations for the second moments of @xmath82 ) and the expected value of @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "since some variables are embbeded in the equations , we can not solve the six odes simultaneously .",
    "fortunately , we can determine a solution recursively once upon one ode is completely solved and it is then used for solving another ode .",
