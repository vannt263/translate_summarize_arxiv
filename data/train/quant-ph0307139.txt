    "kochen and specker s ( 1967 )  theorem ( ks )  puts a severe constraint on possible hidden - variable interpretations of quantum mechanics .",
    "often it is considered an improvement on a similar argument derived from gleason ( 1957 ) theorem ( see , for example , held .",
    "this is true in the sense that ks provide an explicit construction of a finite set of rays on which no two - valued homomorphism exists .",
    "however , the fact that _ there is _ such a finite set follows from gleason s theorem using a simple logical compactness argument ( pitowsky 1998 , a similar point is made in bell 1996 ) .",
    "the existence of finite sets of rays with other interesting features also follow from the same simple consideration . in pitowsky ( 1998 ) some such consequences , in particular the `` logical indeterminacy principle''are pointed out , and some are given a direct constructive proof . in this section",
    "we shall formulate the general compactness principle underlying these results and mention some new ones . in the second section",
    "there are some explicit constructions of finite sets of rays whose existence was inferred indirectly in the first section ; in particular , a simpler proof of the logical indeterminacy principle . in the last section",
    "we prove that there is an effective ( algorithmic ) procedure to construct finite sets of rays which force a uniform approximation to quantum states .",
    "in particular , we provide a short demonstration that gleason s theorem has a constructive proof , a fact previously established by richman and bridges ( 1999 ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a hilbert space of a finite dimension @xmath1 over the complex or real field .",
    "a non negative real function @xmath2 defined on the unit vectors in @xmath0 is called _ a state on _",
    "@xmath0 if the following conditions hold :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath3 for every scalar @xmath4 , and every unit vector @xmath5 .",
    "\\2 . if @xmath6 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath0 then @xmath7 .",
    "gleason s theorem characterizes all states :    _ given a state _ @xmath2 _ _ , there is an hermitian , non negative operator _",
    "_ @xmath8 _ _  on _ _ @xmath0 _ _ , whose trace is unity , such that _ _ @xmath9 _ _  for all unit vectors _ _ @xmath5 _ _ , where _ _ @xmath10 _ _  is the inner product . _ _    gleason s ( 1957 ) original proof of the theorem has three parts : the first is to show that every state @xmath2 on @xmath11 is continuous . the second part is a proof of the theorem in the case of @xmath11 , and the third part is a reduction of the general theorem to @xmath11 .",
    "the theorem is also valid in the infinite dimensional case which we shall not consider .",
    "let us make more precise what are the formal logical assumptions underlying the proof of gleason s theorem .",
    "for simplicity we shall concentrate on the three dimensional real case which comprises the first two parts of gleason s proof .",
    "all our results are extendable to any real or complex hilbert space of a finite dimension @xmath1 .",
    "consider the first order formal theory of the real numbers ( that is , a first order theory of some standard model @xmath12 of the reals ) .",
    "this induces a theory of @xmath11 , together with the inner product , and the unit sphere @xmath13 .",
    "add to this first order theory a function symbol @xmath14 .",
    "let the greek letters @xmath15 denote variables ranging over the reals and @xmath16 be variables ranging over @xmath13 .",
    "now add the axioms :    * g1*. @xmath17    * g2*. @xmath18 @xmath19 .    * g3*. _  for each orthonormal triple _ @xmath20 _ _  an axiom : _ _ @xmath21    note that in * g3 * we do not use the universal quantifier .",
    "instead * g3 * is an axiom schema with a continuum of propositions .",
    "the next axiom is just the statement that every set of reals which is bounded from below has an infimum .",
    "however , since we want to use only first order formulae we write it as an axiom schema :    * g4*. _ for every one place predicate of reals _ @xmath22__expressible in our language an axiom _ _    @xmath23 @xmath24 $ ]    thus , for example , the claim that @xmath2 itself has an infimum will follow from * g1 * and the application of * g4 * to the predicate @xmath25 . as a matter of fact , the proof of gleason s theorem requires twice the application of * g4 * , that is , for two predicates @xmath22 .    the proof that @xmath2 is continuous depends on the axioms *",
    "g1-g4*. one can see this from gleason s ( 1957 ) original proof , or more directly from pitowsky ( 1998 ) that only a finite number of application of the schema * g3 * are required .    to prove the second part , that every state on @xmath11 is given by a self adjoint , non - negative , trace one operator ,",
    "another axiom is needed :    * g5*._if _ @xmath2 _ _  is continuous then its minimum and maximum are obtained : _ _    @xmath26    an elementary way to complete the proof of gleason s theorem on the basis of * g5 * is in cooke et al ( 1984 ) or richman and bridges ( 1999 ) . here",
    "the proof is based on a limiting process . using the continuity of @xmath2 , which has been proved from * g1-g4 * , the claim that @xmath2 obtains its minimum and maximum follows from * g5*. using the minimum and maximum points of @xmath2 one determines the operator @xmath8 , which is the candidate to represent it .",
    "then one proves that for all @xmath27 the proposition @xmath28 holds , which completes the proof .    with these observations",
    "it is easy to see how kochen and specker s theorem follows from gleason s theorem .",
    "consider the proposition :    * f1*. _ there is a state _ @xmath2 _ such that _",
    "@xmath29    now , the conjunction of * f1 * with * g1-g4 * is inconsistent , since the latter imply that @xmath2 is continuous .",
    "hence , there is a proof of a contradiction from * g1-g4 * + * f1*. the proof of that contradiction uses only finitely many cases of the schema * g3 * ( since any proof is finite ) . if one collects the directions @xmath30 which appear in that proof one gets a finite set of directions on which no two valued homomorphism exists",
    "of course this compactness argument does not yield an explicit set , but it may serve as a incentive to look for one , which might have been kochen and specker s motivation . a similar argument",
    "was explicitly used by clifton ( 1993 ) .",
    "he simply lifted the vectors which appear in bell ( 1966 ) simplified 0 - 1 version of `` gleason s theorem '' to obtain a ks theorem .",
    "see also fine and teller ( 1978 ) , pitowsky ( 1982 ) .",
    "but the argument just presented can be easily generalized to include many more propositions which contradict gleason s theorem .",
    "let @xmath31 @xmath13 be a finite set such that @xmath32 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath33 _ _  is a state on _ _",
    "@xmath34 if @xmath2 satisfies * g1-g3 * for all directions _ in _ @xmath34 . now , consider the statement    * f2 * _ there is a state _ @xmath2 _ _  that has exactly _",
    "_ @xmath35__values ( _ _ @xmath36 _ _ ) . in other words , _ _",
    "@xmath2 _ _  satisfies the proposition : _ _    @xmath37    this contradicts gleason s theorem since , again by continuity , if @xmath2 has two or more values it has infinitely many .",
    "hence , for all @xmath36 there is a finite set @xmath34 which contains elements @xmath38 among others , and such that any state @xmath2 on @xmath34 which assigns @xmath35 distinct values to @xmath39 . assigns a different value to @xmath40 .",
    "also , taking the disjunction @xmath41 , we obtain by the same method that _ for each _ @xmath42 _",
    "_  there is a finite set _",
    "_ @xmath43 _ _  such that every non constant state _ _ @xmath2 _ _  on _ _ @xmath43 _ _  has at least _ _",
    "_  values__. we shall give below an explicit construction of @xmath43 in a somewhat more restricted context .",
    "so far we have used only the continuity of @xmath2 , which is proved by * g1-g4 * , but gleason s theorem puts more severe restrictions on states than continuity .",
    "conceptually , one of the important outcomes of gleason s theorem are the uncertainty relations .",
    "casting it in our language it says that any two non - orthogonal , non - opposite directions can not both have extreme probability values ( zero or one ) unless they are both zero .",
    "to see the finite version consider the opposite statement :    * f3 * _ there is a state _ @xmath2 _ such that _",
    "@xmath45    since * f3 * is false we can prove the following : _ given any _",
    "_ @xmath47 _ _  there is a finite set _ _ @xmath34__such that _ _ @xmath48 _ _ , and every state _",
    "_ @xmath2 _ _  on _ _ @xmath34 _ _  satisfies _ _ @xmath49 .",
    "this is the logical indeterminacy principle ( pitowsky 1998 ) which has been proved by an explicit construction , a simplified construction is given below .",
    "note that this result is stronger than ks since it is constraining every _ probability _ distribution on @xmath34 , and not merely the `` truth values '' .",
    "it is `` logical '' in the sense that it follows from the orthogonality relations alone .",
    "we can obtain more dramatic results of this kind , using the fact that by gleason s theorem @xmath50 however , recall that this consequence is derived in the form @xmath51",
    ". we should therefore be careful when moving to finite subsets .",
    "let us begin with the simple example of a pure state .",
    "if we know that @xmath52 then , by gleason s theorem , @xmath53 for all @xmath54 .",
    "the statement @xmath55 contradicts gleason s theorem , but it is refuted by showing that given @xmath54 , and given @xmath56 the condition @xmath57 is satisfied .",
    "hence , one can not expect to be able to force the relation @xmath58 for each @xmath54 on a finite set that contains it .",
    "therefore , consider    * f4 * _ there is a state _ @xmath2 _ _ that satisfies__@xmath59._for some fixed _ @xmath27 .",
    "the proposition * f4 * clearly contradicts gleason s theorem . using our method",
    "we conclude : _ for all _ @xmath27 _ _  and _ _ @xmath60 _ _  _ _ @xmath13 _ _  there is a finite set of directions _ _ @xmath34 _ _  such that _ _ @xmath61 _ _  _ _ @xmath62 _ _ , and every state _ _ @xmath2 _ _  on _ _ @xmath34 _ _  satisfies : _ _ @xmath63 _ _  _ _ @xmath64__. _ _ obviously , this is also true for any finite number of directions beside @xmath54 . the general case , that of a mixture @xmath8 , follows the same pattern . here",
    "it is not enough to specify the value of @xmath2 at one point @xmath61 .",
    "rather , five points are needed since , in general , @xmath8 is a @xmath65 , self adjoint , non negative matrix with trace unity . given these points @xmath66 , and the values @xmath67 , we find for each @xmath54 and @xmath27 a finite set on which the conditions @xmath68 imply @xmath69 . in order",
    "construct this set of directions explicitly one can painstakingly follow the steps of the constructive proof of richman and bridges ( 1999 ) , and `` lift '' the vectors in the proof . an alternative to this tedious procedure",
    "is presented in the third section below , where there is a generic algorithmic way to calculate such graphs ( and to demonstrate that gleason s theorem , and theorems like it , have a constructive proof ) .    all these results are easily extendable to any real or complex hilbert space of a finite dimension @xmath1 , and they are significant for the bayesian approach developed in pitowsky ( 2003 ) .",
    "the results proved here imply that there are _ finite _ quantum gambles in which a rational agent is forced to bet in accordance with the numerical values of quantum probability , or very near them .",
    "the inverse of these compactness results is the claim that there are very large subsets @xmath70 on which 0 - 1 valued states exist .",
    "the `` size '' of such possible @xmath71 depends on set - theoretic assumptions . for example , if the continuum hypothesis is assumed to hold , there is an @xmath71 whose intersection with every major circle @xmath72 in @xmath13satisfies @xmath73 .",
    "weaker assumptions lead to `` smaller '' sets ( pitowsky 1983,1985 ) .",
    "in this section we shall be using rays ( one dimensional subspaces ) rather than unit vectors and take states to be defined on them . given a hilbert space @xmath0 , the assumption @xmath3 for every scalar @xmath4 and every unit vector @xmath5 imply that @xmath2 actually depends on the ray and not on the unit vector we choose to represent it .",
    "our first aim is to prove the `` logical uncertainty principle '' .",
    "the proof here is simpler than pitowsky ( 1998 ) and is based on the `` lifting '' of the vectors in an argument of piron ( 1976 ) .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be two non orthogonal rays in a hilbert space @xmath76 of finite dimension @xmath77 .",
    "then there is a finite set of rays @xmath78 such that @xmath79 and such that a state @xmath2 on @xmath78 satisfy @xmath80 only if @xmath81 .",
    "first , consider the three dimensional real space @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath82 and @xmath83 are two rays in that space there is a unique great circle which they determine .",
    "let @xmath84 be the ray orthogonal to both @xmath82 and @xmath83 and let @xmath85 be the ray orthogonal to both @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "now , consider great circle through @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "if @xmath86 is any ray through this great circle then @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 be the ray orthogonal to both @xmath86 and @xmath85 .",
    "the orthogonality relations between @xmath89 is given in the graph @xmath90  ( figure 2 ) .",
    "subsequently we shall loosely identify sets of rays with their orthogonality graphs .",
    "if @xmath2 is a state defined on the rays in the graph @xmath91 then @xmath92 entails @xmath93 . indeed , @xmath94 .",
    "also , since @xmath92 we have @xmath95 . hence @xmath96 .",
    "the relation between the points @xmath97 and @xmath86 can be best depicted on the projective plane , where @xmath82 is taken as the pole of projection ( figure 3 ) . in the projective plane",
    "great circles appear as straight lines , and latitudes ( relative to @xmath82 as the pole ) appear as concentric circles .",
    "in the projective plane @xmath83 is on a line through @xmath82 , call this line @xmath98 , and @xmath86 is on the line through @xmath83 which is perpendicular to @xmath98 at @xmath83 ..    next , consider three points @xmath99 which do not necessarily have that relation .",
    "assume only that @xmath100 so that if @xmath82 is the north pole , then @xmath86 is more to the south than @xmath83 . in this case",
    "we can find a finite sequence of points @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 and such that @xmath104 is on the line perpendicular to @xmath105 for @xmath106 . a case with @xmath107",
    "is considered in figure 4 .",
    "the number @xmath108 of intermediate points depends on the difference @xmath109 and on the respective longitude of @xmath83 and @xmath86 .",
    "given this set of vectors we can construct for each @xmath35 a graph @xmath110 in which @xmath111 play the role of @xmath99 respectively ( note , @xmath82 is the same throughout ) .",

    "a case with @xmath119 is depicted in figure 5.consider @xmath75 as a pole ( projection point ) and construct a graph @xmath120 @xmath121 which is like @xmath122 with @xmath123 play the role of @xmath99 respectively . if @xmath2 is a state on the rays in this graph with @xmath124 , then @xmath125 .",
    "consider @xmath126 as a pole and construct the graph @xmath127 , which is like @xmath122 , with @xmath128 play the role of @xmath99 respectively .",
    "for a probability function @xmath2 on @xmath129 which satisfy @xmath130 we get @xmath131 .",
    "now construct the graph @xmath132 with @xmath133 as pole and @xmath134 play the role of @xmath135 respectively , and so on .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is a state on @xmath136 the union of all these graphs .",
    "we shall show that if @xmath137 then @xmath138 .",
    "assume , by negation , that @xmath139 then , by construction @xmath125 so that @xmath140 .",
    "but then @xmath131 so that @xmath141 , and @xmath142 so that @xmath143 , and so on and we finally obtain @xmath144 .",
    "this is a contradiction since @xmath118 .",
    "hence @xmath138 .",
    "now , consider the ray @xmath145 which is orthogonal to @xmath75 in the plane spanned by @xmath74 and @xmath146 and let @xmath147 be the ray orthogonal to both @xmath148 . repeat the construction of the graph with @xmath145 instead of @xmath75 to obtain the graph @xmath149 , and add this to the previous graph .",
    "let@xmath150 is a state on the graph @xmath151 with @xmath137 , then @xmath152 and @xmath153 but then we also have @xmath154 . otherwise , @xmath155 together with @xmath156 ( as @xmath157 and @xmath137 ) entail @xmath158 , contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath137 entails @xmath159 . inverting the roles of @xmath74 and @xmath75 we construct a graph @xmath160    with @xmath161 a vector orthogonal to @xmath74 in the plane spanned by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a state on @xmath78 .",
    "if@xmath162 then @xmath163 , and if@xmath164 then @xmath159 .",

    "we do the following : given rays @xmath115 in @xmath0 we consider them first as rays in a three dimensional subspace @xmath165of @xmath0 and complete the construction there .",

    "this completes the proof .",
    "the the above construction entails that pure states should have strictly monotone behavior    given a ray @xmath82 in a hilbert space @xmath0 of a finite dimension @xmath167 , and rays @xmath74 and @xmath75 such that @xmath168 then there is a finite set of rays @xmath169 , which contains @xmath170 , and @xmath75 , such that every state @xmath2 on @xmath169 for which @xmath92 also satisfies @xmath171 .",

    "putting @xmath189 we get that if @xmath92 then @xmath190 if @xmath0 is a hilbert space @xmath191 , complete the construction first on the three dimensional space @xmath192 spanned by @xmath82 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ( in case they all lie in the same plane form @xmath0 @xmath193 by adding any ray orthogonal to them ) .",
    "subsequently add a set of orthogonal rays in @xmath194 to complete the construction .",
    "an immediate consequence of this theorem is the construction of a finite sets of rays on which states must take many values :    given a ray @xmath82 in a hilbert space @xmath0 of a finite dimension @xmath167 , and an integer @xmath35 , there is a finite set of rays @xmath195 such that every state @xmath2 on @xmath195 for which @xmath92 has at least @xmath35 distinct values .",
    "recently , there has been an interesting discussion on the question whether gleason s theorem has a proof which is acceptable by the standards of constructive mathematics ( hellman 1993 , billinge 1997 ) .",
    "the discussion culminated when richman and bridges ( 1999 ) gave a constructive formulation and proof of the theorem .",

    "there is an effective elimination of quantifiers .",
    "this means that there is a ( known ) algorithm which , given any well formed formula as input , produces as output an equivalent formula without the quantifiers @xmath225 , @xmath226 .",

    "hence , there exists a function @xmath278 on @xmath279 into an ordered abelian group @xmath280 with @xmath281 for all @xmath282 and with @xmath283 for all @xmath272 .",
    "in particular , @xmath284 . also , there exists a unique homomorphism @xmath285 with @xmath286 whenever @xmath287 , and @xmath288 .",
    "now @xmath289 is a nonzero element of @xmath290 and therefore ( 1 ) fails .",
    "this establishes the existence of a constructive proof for gleason s theorem in complex hilbert spaces . in this case , the condition `` every bounded function in @xmath233 vanishes '' holds in every model of @xmath224 , iff it holds in @xmath291 automaticaly imply it for every model , since @xmath291 is universal for countable models of @xmath224 ; however , @xmath12 does not have that property . ] .",
    "this means that condition ( 2 ) of the theorem states that gleason s theorem is true iff @xmath292 is provable in @xmath224 for some @xmath44 . but",
    "@xmath224 has an effective decision procedure .    in the real case",
    "there is some complication because we do not assume gleaason s theorem for every model , but only for the standard model ; though a posteriori it will follow for every model . therefore , we have to bridge the gap between `` all models of @xmath223 '' and the standard model @xmath12 for which gleason s theorem is known to be true",
    ". from now on we specialize to the concrete @xmath232 relevant to gleason s theorem .",
    "more specifically , we shall take @xmath231 to be the real projective plane , using its identification with the northern hemisphere @xmath229 of the previous section ( figure 3 ) . with this identification ( and with the point at infinity added ) @xmath231 is compact and @xmath232 is closed .",
    "it follows that the sets @xmath293 , being projections of closed sets , are also closed sets , and so the sets , @xmath294 are open ; but all we need is their measurability with respect to the uniform measure on the sphere , and the measurability of their intersections with major circles with respect to the uniform measure on the circle . since @xmath293 are definable sets , the subsets of the circle that will be mentioned below are finite unions of segments ( i.e. arcs ) and their measure is elementary .      1 .",
    "every bounded function in @xmath233 vanishes .",
    "2 .   for some @xmath44 , @xmath295 where @xmath253 .",
    "( that is , for some @xmath44 , @xmath296 ) 3 .   for some @xmath44 ,  for every great circle @xmath72 , the set @xmath297 has normalized measure @xmath298 in @xmath72 .",
    "4 .   @xmath299 .",
    "condition ( 2 ) , while phrased for @xmath12 , is a single elementary statement ; thus if true it holds in every real closed field , and this fact admits an elementary proof .",
    "so in the special case of gleason s theorem , we can replace `` in every model of @xmath223 '' by `` in @xmath12 . '' .",
    "we will use the following kind of fubini principle : let @xmath300 be the great circle orthogonal to the point @xmath82 on the sphere .",
    "for @xmath301 let @xmath302 be the normalized uniform measure on @xmath300 ; and say that a property @xmath303 holds `` for a majority of points '' if @xmath304 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a fixed great circle and suppose that a majority of points @xmath305 are such that for a majority of points @xmath306 , the property @xmath307 holds .",
    "then , assuming @xmath308 is measurable on the sphere , it has an area @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is the area of the unit sphere above the 45th northern latitude .",
    "the reason is that the region @xmath308 takes up @xmath311 of the area of a mercator map of the sphere ; and the region above the 45 latitude has the greatest distortion under this map .",
    "moving to the projective plane @xmath231 , we can say that @xmath308 takes an area @xmath312 of @xmath231 , when we use the area measure induced on @xmath231 by the mercator map .      indeed",
    ", in the projective plane model , a point @xmath54 on a given circle @xmath316 , has a unique point @xmath317 orthogonal to it on @xmath300 .",
    "suppose the claim fails .",
    "so let @xmath313 and assume that a set of points of @xmath300 of measure @xmath298 lies in @xmath318 .",
    "since the function @xmath319 is a measure - preserving bijection on @xmath300 , the set @xmath320 also has measure @xmath298 .",
    "so these two sets intersect ; thus there exist @xmath321 such that @xmath322 and @xmath323 . but",
    "as @xmath324 form an orthogonal triple , @xmath325 , so it is easy to see that @xmath326 , a contradiction which proves the claim .    *",
    "( 4 ) implies ( 3 ) * : assuming ( 4 ) , there exists @xmath327 such that @xmath328 has measure @xmath329 , that is , mercator measure @xmath330",
    ". let @xmath331 .",
    "let @xmath72 be a great circle .",
    "suppose , by negation , that a majority of points of @xmath72 lie in @xmath332 .",
    "then , by the claim , for each of these points @xmath333 , a majority of points @xmath54 of @xmath300 must lie in @xmath334 .",
    "so this set has ( mercator ) area @xmath335 .",
    "moving to the projective plane we get a contradiction .",
    "thus ( 3 ) holds .    *",
    "( 3 ) implies ( 2 ) * : assume ( 3 ) holds for @xmath336 , and let @xmath337 . if @xmath338 , let @xmath339 be the orthogonal great circle . then by the claim a majority of points on @xmath339 lie in @xmath332 , contradicting ( 3 ) .",
    "the theorem provides an effective procedures to prove @xmath214 in case every @xmath209 vanishes .",
    "the reason is that @xmath223 ( and @xmath227 ) is decidable , which means that there is a computer program which proves evry true propositions of @xmath223 , in particular the proposition @xmath341 for a suitable integer @xmath44 .",
    "any apparent ineffectiveness in the proof of theorem 3 is in some sense self - eliminating , as a posteriori one knows the existence of an effective proof too .",
    "nevertheless , it may be worth remarking that all the sets occurring in the proof are definable in @xmath223 .",
    "these sets are known to have a simple structure , and there would be no difficulty in formalizing the proof in a very small part of peano arithmetic .        here @xmath346 is the set of functions @xmath347 which satisfy the conditions @xmath348 and @xmath349 for every orthogonal triple @xmath350 .",
    "iteration of this process yields a constructive proof of gleason s theorem .",
    "it would be nice to give an explicit construction of the set @xmath34 with this property . as noted",
    ", there is a general algorithm to find it , but such algorithm may not be feasible to execute in practice since the decision procedure for @xmath223 has a worst case doubly exponential time lower bound , see basu ( 1999 ) .",
    "we shall end with a few comments on the boundedness condition in gleason s theorem .",
    "suppose that we drop the requirement that the functions @xmath351 are bounded , then the conclusion @xmath214 is simply false .",
    "one can see this from the following cardinality consideration :    denote by @xmath352 the class of real functions @xmath353 satisfying @xmath354 for every orthogonal triple @xmath355 . by gleason s theorem the cardinality of all _ bounded _ functions in @xmath352 is @xmath356 .",
    "note that @xmath352 ( including its unbounded functions ) is closed under composition with any additive group homomorphism @xmath357 ;",
    "i.e. if @xmath358 and @xmath359 , @xmath360 , then @xmath361 . let @xmath2 be a bounded element of @xmath352 given by some non - zero matrix with trace zero .",
    "if one assumes the axiom of choice , there are @xmath362 additive group homomorphisms from @xmath12 to @xmath12 . composing them with @xmath2 , we see that @xmath352 is enormous , and so certainly gleason s theorem fails without the boundedness requirement .",
    "on the other hand consider a model of set theory in which the axiom of choice fails , solovay s ( 1970 ) model , or if every set has the property of baire say .",
    "then every function @xmath357 is continuous on a set whose complement is meager ; if it is also a group homomorphism , it will be continuous everywhere .",
    "thus , with this kind of negation of the axiom of choice , it is not implausible that the boundedness of frame functions might be automatic . coming back to the remark at the end of section 1",
    ", we also note that in such models there are no large @xmath363 on which 0 - 1 valued states exist ( shipman 1990 ) .",
    "it seems instructive at all events to compare lemma 3 to what one obtains when @xmath232 satisfies the stronger assumption , that _ every _ function ( bounded or otherwise ) vanishes",
    ". then one can replace in lemma 3(2 ) the reference to @xmath364 by      the proof is the same as that of lemma 3 , mutatis mutandis , noting that when @xmath238 is a divisible abelian group and @xmath366 , there exists a homomorphism @xmath285 with @xmath367 ( not necessarily order preserving . )",
