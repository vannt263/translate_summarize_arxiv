    "the normal state of high temperature superconductors ( ht@xmath3sc ) is characterized by unusual properties , most of them still lacking of a comprehensive theoretical description . in particular , the transfer of spin excitations from low to high - energy range ( spin - gap opening ) well above @xmath0 , detected in the generalized susceptibility from @xmath4 and neutron scattering measurements ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "1 ) , and the related quasi - particle gap , observed in arpes@xmath5 , have been tentatively related to superconducting fluctuations ( sf ) of various nature . among them , one could mention preformed pairs without long - range phase coherence , possibly along stripes@xmath6 , spin and/or charge density waves@xmath7 , coupling of a d - wave symmetry order parameter with spin fluctuations@xmath8 , order parameter fluctuations well beyond the perturbative approach@xmath9 and quantum critical point fluctuations@xmath10 . for a review on precursor",
    "pairing correlations and a survey of the various scenarios see ref . 14 .",
    "furthermore the magnetic field has been argued@xmath11 to have a role on sf of overdoped ht@xmath3sc also , by inducing a spin - gap from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the role of the magnetic field is crucial in nmr - nqr attempts to study sf in the vicinity of @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the most direct contribution to sf , namely the aslamazov - larkin term , responsible of paraconductivity@xmath15 , is not effective in causing an extra - contribution to nmr - nqr relaxation . in principle , the sf contribution to the relaxation rates , for @xmath16 , are the maki - thompson ( mt ) one ( related to the pairing of a carrier with itself at a previous stage of motion ) , and the reduction due to the depletion in the single - particle density of states ( dos ) , when fluctuating pairs are created@xmath15 .",
    "these two terms might have a different sensitivity to the presence of a magnetic field , which acts as a pair - breaking factor .",
    "the first nmr experimetal observation@xmath17 of the role played by sf in ht@xmath3sc was based on the comparison of @xmath18cu relaxation rate @xmath19 in ybco in the absence ( i.e. nqr ) and in the presence of a magnetic field of about 6 t. within about 10 degrees above @xmath20 , @xmath21 was found to decrease upon application of the field by a factor about 5@xmath2215% .",
    "a qualitative interpretation of the experimental observation was given by assuming that the field reduced the mt term to about 25% , while the more robust dos term was little affected by the field .",
    "the equations used in these estimates@xmath17 were the ones@xmath23 pertaining to a three - dimensional ( 3d ) layered spectrum of excitations ( with anisotropy parameter @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the correlation lenght of the cooper pair at zero temperature , along the @xmath26-axis , and @xmath27 the interlayer distance ) .",
    "the occurence of a pure 2d regime of sf could be ruled out , on the basis of the absolute value and of the temperature dependence of the sf contribution to @xmath18cu .",
    "the first systematic analysis of the field dependence of nmr relaxation rate in ybco was carried out in 1998 by mitrovi @xmath1 @xmath28 , by varying the field from 2.1 up to 27.3 t. the @xmath18cu @xmath4 was probed@xmath29 through the contribution to the @xmath23o echo dephasing .",
    "for field in the range 6@xmath228 t , the results derived in this way@xmath29 were found to coincide with the direct measurements of @xmath18cu @xmath4 . at high field , @xmath30 was argued to be strongly reduced by the field .",
    "these data@xmath29 , as well as the field dependence of @xmath23o(2,3 ) knight shift@xmath31 , have been interpreted on the basis of a theory for the dos contribution due to eschrig @xmath1 @xmath32 , which extended analytical approaches@xmath23 to include short wave - lenght and dynamical fluctuations , in the assumption of a 2d regime .",
    "recently , gorny @xmath1 @xmath33 reported precise @xmath18cu relaxation measurements in ybco for @xmath34 , 8.8 and 14.8 t , finding no magnetic field dependence in a wide temperature range .",
    "a possible dependence of the field effect on the amount of doping could be suspected since , at the same time , no field effect had been observed@xmath35 in underdoped ybco .    in this paper",
    "we derive the magnetic field dependence of the mt and dos contributions to nmr @xmath4 , in the framework of a diagrammatic description , for arbitrary values of the reduced field @xmath36 , for a 3d layered spectrum of fluctuations , which should pertain to the case of ybco with low anisotropy parameter . in order to remove the logarithmic divergence present in the dos term , here we use the method devised@xmath37 for transverse conductivity , in which regularization requirement , analogous to the ones for the nuclear relaxation rate , is present .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discuss the role of the long wave - vector fluctuations and of the dynamical fluctuations .",
    "our analytical conclusive expressions are compared with the numerical solutions@xmath38 for the 2d regime and with the experimental measurements carried out until now .",
    "in the following , we extend the diagrammatic theory for the sf contribution to nmr - nqr relaxation rate , to include the effects due to the presence of a magnetic field along the @xmath26-axis , in ht@xmath3sc .    in the presence of the field",
    "the mt and dos contributions to the relaxation rates@xmath39 must be evaluated by starting from the usual inclusion in the momentum @xmath40 of the term @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "the integration over @xmath40 , in the @xmath43 plane , is substituted by a sum over the landau levels .",
    "thus the mt and dos contributions@xmath23 to @xmath19 assume the forms    @xmath44 \\label{mtgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ordinary relaxation rate in the absence of sf ( the korringa one in a fermi gas - like model ) .",
    "in the above equations , @xmath47 is the fermi energy , @xmath48 the single particle collision time , @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 , 2d carrier diffusion constant and @xmath51 depairing energy ) is a dimensionless factor which , in the limit @xmath52 , takes into account the pair - breaking effect and @xmath53 is the reduced temperature .",
    "@xmath54 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is the function    @xmath55 + \\psi ^{\\prime } ( 1/2)}=   \\cases { \\frac{14\\zeta ( 3)}{\\pi ^3},&$t\\tau \\ll 1 $ \\cr   4t\\tau , & $ t\\tau \\gg 1$\\cr}\\ ] ] where , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the euler digamma function .",
    "the expressions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are general and hold for any magnetic field , provided that @xmath58 ( see ref . 24 ) .",
    "the dos term shows a logarithmic divergence in the sum .",
    "the behaviours of @xmath59 and @xmath30 , for small fields , can easily be derived from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , by a straightforward expansion .",
    "the intermediate and strong field regimes , namely @xmath60 , require some care . for the mt contribution ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) the sum over @xmath61 converges rapidly and thus , for strong fields , only the term @xmath62 can be taken into account .",
    "for the dos contribution ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) , however , the logarithmic divergence must be removed .",
    "this can be achieved by considering the cut - off independent difference    @xmath63    the zero field expression is rewritten in the form    @xmath64    and then , eq . ( 3 ) becomes    @xmath65    where the summation has been extended up to @xmath66 , since @xmath67 now involves a summation which is convergent ( the n - th term being proportional to @xmath68 for large @xmath61 ) .",
    "now we are going to discuss the behaviours of @xmath30 and @xmath59 in the asymptotic limits , corresponding to different temperature and field regimes .      in the weak field regime , namely @xmath69 , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath70 . for the dos term ,",
    "in particular , the euler - maclaurin formula    @xmath71+{\\frac 1{{12}}}% [ f^{^{\\prime } } ( n)-f^{^{\\prime } } ( 0)]+\\ldots \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    yields @xmath72^{3/2}}- \\frac{\\varepsilon+r/2 } { [ \\varepsilon(\\varepsilon+r)]^{3/2}}\\biggr)\\biggr ] \\label{mtw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath73^{3/2}}}}% \\biggr ] \\label{dosw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      for the mt term in the strong field regime ( @xmath74 ) , by expanding eq . ( 1 ) in powers of @xmath75 , one has    @xmath76    in the intermediate case ( namely @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , which can become relevant for a 3d layered compound , the series expansions in terms of the smallest parameters yield    @xmath79    @xmath80    for the field dependence of the dos correction to the zero field contribution ( eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) , in strong field regime , one can take into account the @xmath62 term only :    @xmath81    the @xmath82 terms , neglected in this evaluation , yield a correction of 0.02 in the bracket term in eq ( 11 ) .    in the intermediate fields , namely for @xmath83 ( corresponding to a 3d layered regime of fluctuations ) , by means of an expansion of eq .",
    "( 5 ) in terms of @xmath84 one has    @xmath85",
    "as it appears from the theoretical treatment given in the previous section , the dependence on the magnetic field of the sf contributions to the nmr - nqr relaxation rate is a rather delicate issue , because of the non - trivial interplay of several parameters , such as @xmath86 , the reduced field @xmath87 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath88 , the elastic collision time @xmath48 and the anelastic phase - breaking time @xmath89 .",
    "eschrig @xmath1 @xmath32 , in their numerical extension of the previous analytical approaches@xmath23 , have considered arbitrary values of @xmath54 and taken into account short wave - lenght and dynamical fluctuations . however , this generalization has required the restriction to a purely 2d regime of sf , which seems questionable in view of experimental findings in ybco , pointing out a crossover to 3d fluctuations well above @xmath0 , at least for relatively small fields@xmath90 . on the other hand",
    ", it could be remarked that dynamical fluctuations are relevant only when the field is comparable to @xmath91 t. therefore the reduction to static and small wave - vector fluctuations should not invalidate our conclusive expressions given above .    to illustrate the theoretical expressions , derived in section",
    "ii , we plot in figs .",
    "1 and 2 the temperature and field behaviours of @xmath30 and @xmath59 , with a choice of parameters appropriate to ybco optimally doped .    in fig .",
    "3 the experimental results from various authors ( and from different ybco samples , about optimally doped ) are compared with the behaviour expected for dos contribution , according to eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) . a relatively small field dependence , of both dos and mt contributions , up to a reduced field of about 0.2 ,",
    "is noticed . for strong fields",
    "a reduction of the mt term can be expected , while the dos term seems only slightly affected ( see figs .",
    "1b and 2b ) .",
    "as a consequence , either for s - symmetry of the fluctuating cooper pair ( namely , presence of both the mt and dos effects of sf on @xmath4 ) or for d - symmetry ( and therefore , no mt contribution ) only a slight dependence of @xmath4 , on the magnetic field , should be detected , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , for the dos term . in particular the experimental data@xmath29 at strong fields ( @xmath92 ) can hardly be justified .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical description and the experimental findings , at strong fields , might be related to the general framework involved in our treatment .",
    "howerver , it should be stressed that a breakdown of the fermi liquid picture should not invalidate the expression for the dos contribution , which is independent from the pairing mechanism and the normal state properties .",
    "the dimensional crossover ( 3d@xmath932d ) for strong fields is taken into account in our equations , but it could be argued that dynamical and short wave - lenght fluctuations are no longer negligible in a 2d strong field regime . finally , it should be taken into consideration the possibility that the method of an indirect estimate of @xmath18cu @xmath4 from @xmath23o echo dephasing@xmath29 could be invalidated in strong fields .    summarizing , from the behaviour of @xmath18cu",
    "@xmath94 one can infer that a dos sf contribution to the nuclear relaxation is present in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "the mt term is more elusive , requiring a s - wave component in the spectrum of the sf and being possibly strongly sample - dependent , through the pair - breaking and impurities effects .",
    "the field dependence of dos term is a rather delicate issue , complicated by various crossovers and parameters .",
    "further theoretical and experimental work is required for a firm conclusion .",
