    "one of the interesting peculiarities of the linearly - polarized spectrum observed by @xcite in quiet regions close to the solar limb is that a variety of spectral lines from minority species , which produce almost negligible absorption features in the fraunhofer spectrum , nonetheless stand up with significant contrast in fractional linear polarization ( i.e. , in the @xmath6 spectrum ) , is the specific intensity at a given wavelength , while stokes @xmath7 represents here the intensity difference between linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the closest solar limb . ] .",
    "for example , molecules make a significant contribution to the structural richness of this so - called second solar spectrum , and it is of interest to note that their magnetic sensitivity through the hanle effect has facilitated the exploration of the sun s hidden magnetism ( see the detailed review by * ? ? ? * and more references therein ) .",
    "spectral lines from rare earths , such as those from ionized cerium , are also of interest for obtaining information on unresolved , tangled magnetic fields in the `` quiet '' solar atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the main aim of this paper is to investigate the physical origin and the diagnostic potential of what is probably the weakest @xmath0 spectral feature produced by a minority species in the whole second solar spectrum : that observed by @xcite in the li  i resonance doublet at 6708   ( see figure  [ fig : observation ] ) .",
    "although it is generally accepted that the second solar spectrum is due to radiatively induced population imbalances and quantum coherences in the atoms and molecules of the solar atmosphere , and several interesting spectral lines have been successfully modeled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much remains to be done to fully understand the @xmath0 profiles observed in many other spectral lines .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : observation ] , the line center value of the observed @xmath0 profile published by @xcite is only @xmath8 , and its detection required to sacrifice completely the spatio - temporal resolution in order to be able to push down the _ rms _ noise to below the @xmath9 level .",
    "the fwhm of the observed @xmath0 profile is about 190 m .",
    "the most peculiar feature of the observed signal is its three - peak structure , which bears a qualitative resemblance to the triple peak structure of the @xmath0 profile observed in the na  i d@xmath2 line . like the sodium doublet , the li  i one at 6708   results from a d@xmath2 type transition ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and a d@xmath3 type transition ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) , with the difference that lithium has two isotopes : @xmath4li ( with nuclear spin @xmath13 and a relative meteoritic abundance of 92.41% ) and @xmath5li ( with @xmath14 and a relative meteoritic abundance of 7.59% ) .",
    "the fact that quantum interferences between the @xmath10 and @xmath12 levels are indeed important for understanding the @xmath0 pattern observed at wavelengths around the sodium d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 lines @xcite led @xcite to argue that the @xmath0 feature shown in figure  [ fig : observation ] must be seriously influenced by a quantum mechanical superposition of the scattering transitions in the d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 lines of lithium .",

    "we think that this can be achieved with a particularly high level of confidence for this lithium doublet , because its extreme weakness in the intensity spectrum suggests that radiative transfer effects play no significant role on the _ shape _ of the @xmath0 profile . indeed , the anisotropic radiation pumping is basically that due to the solar continuum radiation .",

    "september 8 , near the south polar limb . from @xcite.,scaledwidth=53.0% ]    as we shall see , the application of the above - mentioned quantum theory of spectral line polarization leads to the conclusion that only two peaks can be expected for the @xmath0 profile of the li  i resonance doublet at 6708   .",
    "interestingly , we find that the strongest peak at 6707.75   is caused by the d@xmath2 line of @xmath4li  i , while the weakest one at about 6707.9   is due to the d@xmath2 line of @xmath5li  i. since in the sun the line opacity of this lithium doublet is negligible with respect to that of the continuum , contrary to the case of strong lines like na  i d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 , or ca  ii h and k , these lithium lines neither show extended wings in the intensity spectrum nor in the @xmath0 spectrum , the continuum level being rapidly reached as one moves away from line center . this explains why quantum interferences between hfs @xmath28-levels pertaining to different @xmath29-levels , whose signatures are negligible in the line core but become dominant in the wings , are found to play no significant role on the emergent @xmath0 profile of this lithum doublet .",
    "moreover , we find that such two peaks in the theoretical @xmath0 profile stand up clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin atmospheric region that produces the emergent @xmath0 profile is lower than 4000  k. in order to be able to reproduce the width of the observed @xmath0 profile without accounting for non - thermal broadening we need at least 6000  k , but for t@xmath305000 k the predicted @xmath0 profile is slightly asymmetric ( i.e. , with a more extended red wing ) and only shows the dominant peak due to @xmath4li  i.    the outline of the paper is the following . in section  2 ,",
    "we present the atomic model and the structure of the hyperfine multiplets , both of @xmath5li  i and of @xmath4li  i. in the same section , we briefly present the density matrix formalism which we have adopted in order to describe the atomic polarization induced in the various levels by anisotropic radiation pumping processes . the optically thin slab model considered in this investigation , and the relevant equations describing the polarization of the emergent radiation are discussed in section  3 . in section  4 , the resulting theoretical @xmath0 profile is shown , and the physical origin of its spectral features is investigated .",
    "section 4.1 is dedicated to a discussion of the role of quantum interferences between the upper @xmath29-levels of the d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 lines .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the resulting profile to the isotopic abundances and to microturbulent magnetic fields is discussed in section  5 .",
    "section 6 collects our conclusions with an outlook to future research .",
    "we adopt a three - level model of li  i consisting in the ground level ( 2_s _ @xmath31s@xmath32 ) , the upper level of the d@xmath3 line ( 2@xmath33 @xmath31p@xmath32 ) , and the upper level of the d@xmath2 line ( 2@xmath33 @xmath31p@xmath34 ) .",
    "the energies of the fine structure levels are taken from @xcite . in order to take into account the isotopic effect , we correct the energies of the @xmath31p@xmath32 and of the @xmath31p@xmath34 levels of @xmath5li  i using the values of the isotopic shifts in the d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 lines listed in table  [ tab : phys - prop ] .    the hfs hamiltonian , describing the interaction between the nuclear spin and the electronic angular momentum , can be expressed as a series of electric and magnetic multipoles ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate the energies of the hfs @xmath28-levels using the values of the magnetic dipole and of the electric quadrupole hfs constants ( usually indicated with the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) listed in table  [ tab : phys - prop ] .",
    "we recall that in the absence of magnetic fields , using dirac s notation , the energy eigenvectors can be written in the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 represents a set of inner quantum numbers ( specifying the configuration and , if the atomic system is described by the @xmath37-@xmath38 coupling scheme , the total electronic orbital and spin angular momenta ) , @xmath29 is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number , while @xmath28 and @xmath39 are the quantum numbers associated with the total angular momentum operator ( electronic plus nuclear : * f*=*j*+*i * ) , and with its projection along the quantization axis , respectively .",
    "the grotrian diagrams showing the various hfs @xmath28-levels of the two isotopes , and the hfs components of the d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 lines are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : grotrian ] . in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : grotrian ]",
    "the laboratory positions of the various hfs components are shown . since the isotopic shifts are of the same order of magnitude as the frequency separation between the two d - lines , the d@xmath3 line of @xmath4li  i falls almost at the same wavelength as the d@xmath2 line of @xmath5li  i ( see panels _ a _ and _ c _ of figure  [ fig : grotrian ] ) .",
    "we observe that in both isotopes the ground level splits into two hfs @xmath28-levels .",
    "the splitting between these two levels is much larger than that among the hfs @xmath28-levels pertaining to the upper levels . as a consequence",
    ", the hfs components both of the d@xmath3 and of the d@xmath2 lines can be gathered into two groups .",
    "note also that it is not possible to resolve , even in the laboratory spectra , all the hfs components of the d@xmath2 line , since their frequency separation is smaller than the natural width ( compare the magnetic dipole hfs constant of the d@xmath2 upper level with the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission in this line , quoted in table  [ tab : li - transitions ] ) .",
    "we describe the excitation state of the li  i levels by means of the density matrix formalism , a robust theoretical framework very suitable for treating the atomic polarization ( population unbalances , and quantum interferences among the magnetic sublevels ) that can be induced , for instance , by an anisotropic incident radiation field . in principle , to have a complete description of the atomic polarization , one has to take into account all the quantum interferences ( or coherences ) of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the density operator . in this investigation",
    "we , first , restricted to the @xmath29-diagonal density matrix elements @xmath42 or , in other words , we neglected coherences between different @xmath29-levels . according to ll04 , the resulting model atom is referred to as _ multi - level atom with hfs_. the statistical equilibrium equations ( see ) , and the radiative transfer coefficients for a multi - level atom with hfs can be found in ll04 .",
    "more general calculations , that we carried out including the interferences between the upper hfs levels of the d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 lines , showed that the previous approximation is fully justified for the investigation of this lithium doublet . indeed ,",
    "as it will be shown in section  4.1 , the theoretical @xmath0 profiles obtained through the solution of these more general equations can not be distinguished from those shown in this paper , which , as mentioned above , neglect quantum interferences between different @xmath29-levels .",
    "this is due to the weakness of the lithium doublet which does not allow for the formation of extended wings where such quantum interferences would produce their main signatures .",

    "we assume the slab to be illuminated from below by the observed photospheric continuum radiation field , that we suppose to be unpolarized and cylindrically symmetric about the local vertical . under these assumptions , taking a reference system with the @xmath48-axis ( the quantization axis ) directed along the vertical , only two components of the radiation field tensor , through which we describe the incident continuum radiation , are non - vanishing : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the cosine of the heliocentric angle .",
    "the former quantity is the mean intensity of the incident radiation field ( averaged over all directions ) , the second one quantifies its degree of anisotropy ( unbalance between vertical and horizontal illumination ) .",
    "mean intensity and anisotropy degree of the radiation field can also be expressed in terms of two non - dimensional quantities : the average number of photons per mode , @xmath51 , and the so - called anisotropy factor , @xmath52 ( which varies between @xmath53 , for the case of horizontal illumination by an unpolarized radiation field without azimuthal dependence , and @xmath54 for vertical unpolarized illumination ) .",
    "such quantities are related to @xmath55 and @xmath56 by the equations @xmath57 we calculate the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the photospheric continuum at the frequencies of the li  i d - lines , following section  12.3 of ll04 taking @xmath60 , and using the values of the disk - center intensities and of the limb - darkening coefficients given by @xcite . the values obtained are listed in table  [ tab : li - transitions ] . once the see have been written down and solved numerically , we can calculate the radiative transfer coefficients .",
    "we consider the radiation scattered by the slab at 90@xmath61 , and we take the reference direction for positive @xmath62 parallel to the slab . for the case of a tangential observation , in a weakly polarizing atmosphere ( @xmath63 ) , the polarization of the emergent radiation is given by ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath64 the first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dichroism ] ) represents the contribution to the emergent radiation due to selective emission processes , the second one is caused by dichroism ( selective absorption of polarization components ) .",
    "the way atomic polarization is distributed among the various levels by radiative processes is very similar to the case of the sodium and barium d - lines , investigated by @xcite and by @xcite , respectively .",
    "we recall in particular that only the upper level of the d@xmath2 line can be directly polarized by the anisotropic incident radiation field .",
    "the ground level becomes polarized because of a transfer of atomic polarization via spontaneous emission in the d@xmath2 line , while the d@xmath3 upper level is polarized via radiative absorption in the d@xmath3 line ( `` repopulation pumping '' ) .",
    "indeed , solving the see in the absence of magnetic fields , one finds that the d@xmath2 line upper level is considerably more polarized than both the d@xmath3-line upper level and the ground level .",
    "dichroism therefore can be safely neglected as far as d@xmath2 is concerned , while it is expected to be more important in the d@xmath3 line . however , given that the polarization signal produced by the d@xmath3 line of li  i is expected to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the one produced by the d@xmath2 line , we neglect dichroism also in the d@xmath3 line .",
    "we calculate therefore the polarization of the emergent radiation through the simpler equation @xmath65 the emission coefficients that appear in the previous equation include only line processes : in order to reproduce the observed @xmath0 profile , we need to add the contribution of the continuum .",
    "assuming such contributions to be constant across the line we have @xmath66 where the superscripts `` @xmath67 '' and `` @xmath68 '' recall that the corresponding quantities refer to continuum and line processes , respectively . the quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 will be considered as free parameters to be adjusted in order to reproduce the observed polarization profile .",
    "the effect of collisions will be neglected throughout this investigation .",
    "it should be observed that given the extreme weakness of the absorption features of this lithium doublet in the solar intensity spectrum , the optically thin slab model is expected to be a rather good approximation for the modelling of these lines .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : qsui_cont ] ) , and assuming the following values of the free parameters @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the maximum value of @xmath73 in the wavelength range considered , @xmath74 , and a doppler width of 60 m , we obtain the two - peak linear polarization profile shown in figure  [ fig : best_fit ] .",
    "profile obtained assuming the following values of the free parameters : @xmath71 , @xmath75 .",
    "the profile is obtained for a doppler width of 60  m , which corrresponds to @xmath76  k.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as can be observed in the left panel of figure  [ fig : cont - doppler ] , modifying the continuum contribution to the intensity we modify the amplitude of the two peaks , without changing the shape of the profile .",
    "the value that we assumed for the continuum contribution ( @xmath71 ) appears to be a good choice , given the weakness of the line , and that it allows the peak falling at shorter wavelengths ( hereafter referred to as the `` blue peak '' ) to reach the same amplitude ( 0.02% ) as the central peak of the @xmath0 profile observed by @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : observation ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath77 has been adjusted in order to obtain in the far wings the same continuum polarization level as in the observation ( 0.01% ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the sensitivity of the theoretical @xmath0 profile to the value of the doppler width .",
    "the profile shown in figure  [ fig : best_fit ] has been obtained assuming a doppler width of 60  m , which corresponds , neglecting microturbulent velocities , to a temperature of 3000  k. for the sake of simplicity , we consider the same doppler width for the two isotopes , despite their mass difference ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "profiles obtained assuming different values of the doppler width are plotted in the right panel of figure  [ fig : cont - doppler ] .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the two - peak structure gradually disappears as the doppler width is increased : the observation of a two - peak structure could thus provide precise information concerning the thermal properties of the thin atmospheric region where this weak lithium doublet is formed .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig:2is - hfs ] , the same @xmath0 profile as in figure  [ fig : best_fit ] is plotted together with the profiles expected in the hypothetical cases where only @xmath5li ( short - dashed line ) or only @xmath4li ( long - dashed line ) were present .",
    "the polarization peak that is obtained when a single isotope is considered ( either @xmath5li or @xmath4li ) is , in both cases , due to the corresponding d@xmath2 line . indeed , the polarization signals produced by the d@xmath3 lines , both of @xmath5li  i and of @xmath4li  i , are several orders of magnitude smaller , and can not be appreciated on this plot .",
    "it is then clear that the physical origin of the two - peak structure of the @xmath0 profile that we have obtained within our modelling assumption lies in the isotopic shift between the two lithium isotopes : the two peaks are nothing else but the signals produced by the d@xmath2 lines of @xmath4li  i ( blue peak ) and of @xmath5li  i ( red peak ) , which fall at different wavelengths because of the isotopic shift , and which are weighted by the isotopic abundances .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the signals due to the d@xmath2 lines of the two isotopes , as found in the hypothetical cases where only @xmath5li or only @xmath4li were present , do not have the same amplitude ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig:2is - hfs ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact the two isotopes have different hfs ( in particular different nuclear spin quantum numbers , and different hfs constants , producing different splittings among the various @xmath28-levels , so that @xmath5li is less depolarized by hfs than @xmath4li ) . as a consequence",
    ", the relative amplitude of the two peaks that we have found in the resulting @xmath0 profile does not reflect only the different abundances of the two lithium isotopes , but also their different hfs .",
    "therefore , the presence of hfs in the two isotopes has to be taken into account in order to obtain the correct relative amplitude between the two peaks .",
    "this is clearly shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig:2is - hfs ] , where the profiles obtained including ( solid line ) and neglecting ( dashed line ) hfs are plotted .",
    "although the d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 lines ( both of @xmath5li  i and @xmath4li  i ) are very close to each other , so that quantum interferences between the upper levels of the corresponding transitions are not negligible , it is important to point out that , because of the weakness of these lines , the continuum level is rapidly reached both in the intensity spectrum , and in the @xmath0 spectrum , and the spectral signatures of such coherences are completely lost .",
    "this can be easily appreciated in figure  [ fig : super - interf ] , where the theoretical @xmath0 profiles , obtained both without ( upper panel ) and with ( lower panel ) continuum , are plotted according to three different approximations : _ a _ ) taking into account hfs , but neglecting interferences between pairs of hfs magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath29-levels ( solid line ) , _ b _ ) neglecting hfs , but taking into account interferences between pairs of magnetic sublevels pertaining to different @xmath29-levels ( dotted line ) , and _",

    "the vertical dashed lines show the wavelength positions ( going from the blue to the red ) of @xmath4li  i d@xmath2 , of @xmath4li  i d@xmath3 and @xmath5li  i d@xmath2 ( blended ) , and of @xmath5li  i d@xmath3 .",
    "lower panel : same as the upper panel , but including the contribution of the continuum .",
    "the quantities @xmath80 and @xmath77 have the same values as in figure  [ fig : best_fit ] .",
    "the profile plotted with solid line is the same as in figure  [ fig : best_fit].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the first approximation is the one that has been applied in this paper ( see section  2 ) .",
    "a detailed description of the other approximations , usually referred to as _ multi - term atom _ and _ multi - term atom with hfs _ can be found in ll04 , and in @xcite , respectively .",
    "we start considering the results obtained without continuum ( upper panel ) .",
    "as expected , close to line center there is no appreciable difference between the profile obtained including the interferences between the upper levels of the d@xmath3 and d@xmath2 lines ( dashed - line profile ) and the one obtained neglecting such interferences ( solid - line profile ) .",
    "actually , we recall that such interferences play an important role in the wings of the line , being negligible close to the line core . at line center ,",
    "on the other hand , there is an appreciable difference between the profiles obtained taking into account ( solid- and dashed - line profiles ) and neglecting ( dotted - line profile ) hfs . in the far wings , on the contrary , as can be observed by comparing the dashed- and the dotted - line profiles , there is no difference between the results obtained by taking into account or neglecting hfs ( as known , the effect of hfs vanishes in the far wings of the line ) . at these wavelengths , on the other hand , the interferences between different @xmath29-levels become important , and their effect can be easily appreciated . in particular , we observe that the asymptotic value reached by the profiles obtained taking into account such interferences ( dashed- and dotted - line profiles ) is much higher than the one reached by the profile calculated neglecting these interferences ( solid - line profile ) .",
    "however , if the continuum contributions to stokes @xmath15 and @xmath62 are included , so that a two - peak profile with the same amplitude as the observed one is obtained , the polarization in the wings of the line is rapidly decreased to the continuum level , so that the profile obtained by taking into account the interferences between different @xmath29-levels can not be distinguished from the one obtained neglecting such interferences ( see the lower panel of figure  [ fig : super - interf ] , where the solid and dashed lines superimpose ) .",
    "the only difference that can still be noticed is at line center , between the profiles obtained by including and neglecting hfs ( as already shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig:2is - hfs ] ) .",
    "we point out that the depolarization of the @xmath0 profile in the wings of the line , which has completely hidden the signatures of the interferences between the different @xmath29-levels , is particularly strong in these lines since a significant continuum contribution ( @xmath71 ) is needed in order to reproduce the amplitude ( @xmath81 ) of the observed @xmath0 profile .",
    "nevertheless , as already pointed out , this is a rather realistic value , given the extreme weakness of this lithium doublet the effects of the interferences between different @xmath29-levels turn out to be hidden .",
    "] . in conclusion ,",
    "as anticipated in section  2 , interferences between the upper levels of the @xmath82 and d@xmath2 lines , though present , can be safely neglected in the modelling of these lines .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fig : abb - mag ] the profiles obtained changing the relative abundance of the two isotopes are plotted .",
    "we observe that as the @xmath5li abundance is increased , the amplitude of the blue peak decreases , while the amplitude of the red one increases .",
    "this behavior suggests the possibility of using the relative amplitude of the two peaks to estimate the abundance ratio of the two lithium isotopes in the quiet solar atmosphere .",
    "note that the two peaks have a slightly different sensitivity to the relative isotopic abundance .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the blue peak is only caused by the @xmath4li  i d@xmath2 line , whereas the red peak , though dominated by the @xmath5li  i d@xmath2 line , is also affected by the @xmath4li  i d@xmath3 line .",
    "obviously the amplitude of the two peaks of this @xmath0 profile is not sensitive only to the isotopic abundance , but also to collisions ( here neglected ) , and to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "as it can be observed in the right panel of figure  [ fig : abb - mag ] , in the presence of a unimodal microturbulent and isotropic magnetic field the amplitude of the two peaks is reduced because of the hanle effect .",
    "note that the two peaks have a slightly different magnetic sensitivity ( for example , the relative depolarization that takes place going from 1 to 2  g is larger in the red peak ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the two isotopes have different nuclear spin quantum numbers and different hfs splittings .",
    "the saturation regime is reached for magnetic fields of about 50  g. in conclusion , a correct estimate of the lithium isotopic abundance from the relative amplitude of the two peaks of the @xmath0 profile would require an independent determination of the magnetic field strength present in the regions of the solar atmosphere that produce the observed scattering polarization . likewise , for a given approximate value of the lithium isotopic abundance the two peaks of the @xmath0 profile of the lithium doublet can be used to obtain information on the strength of unresolved , hidden magnetic fields in the `` quiet '' sun .",
    "the problem is that it is unlikely that such two peaks can indeed be observed ( see below ) .",
    "the application of the quantum theory of spectral line polarization leads to the conclusion that only two peaks can be expected for the @xmath0 profile of the li  i resonance doublet at 6708   .",
    "interestingly , we find that the strongest peak at about 6707.75   is caused by the d@xmath2 line of @xmath4li  i , while the weakest one at about 6707.9   is due to the d@xmath2 line of @xmath5li  i. since for the lithium doublet in the sun the line opacity is negligible with respect to that of the continuum , we find that quantum interferences between the hfs levels pertaining to different @xmath29-levels play no significant role on the emergent @xmath0 profile .",
    "moreover , we have showed that such two peaks in the theoretical @xmath0 profile stand up clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin atmospheric region that produces the main contribution to the emergent @xmath0 profile is sufficiently low ( e.g. , sensibly lower than 4000  k ) . in order to be able to reproduce the width of the observed @xmath0 profile , without accounting for non - thermal broadening ,",
    "we need at least 6000  k , but for this kinetic temperature the predicted @xmath0 profile is slightly asymmetric ( i.e. , with a more extended red wing ) and shows only the dominant peak due to @xmath4li  i. in this respect , it is of interest to note that the height in standard semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere where the continuum optical depth at the wavelength of the lithium doublet is unity for a line - of - sight with @xmath83 is slightly below 200 km ( see figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the kinetic temperature is about 5000 k. for this reason , we believe that the most likely _ shape _ of the scattering polarization profile of the lithium doublet that the sun can produce should be similar to the short - dashed line of the right panel of figure  [ fig : cont - doppler ] .",
    "if that is the case ( i.e. , if the true @xmath0 profile of the lithium doublet turns out to have only one peak ) then it would not be possible to apply the `` peak - ratio technique '' illustrated in figure  [ fig : abb - mag ] , neither for determining the relative lithium isotopic abundances nor for estimating the strength of an unresolved , hidden magnetic field in the solar photosphere .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude , fwhm , and asymmetry of the observed @xmath0 profile could still be used for such a purpose through radiative transfer simulations in a realistic model of the thermal and density structure of the quiet solar photosphere .",
    "for example , if the relative lithium isotopic abundance is known beforehand , the discrepancy between the @xmath0 profile calculated in a three - dimensional hydrodynamical model of the solar photosphere and the observed profile could be interpreted in terms of an unresolved magnetic field , assuming that the depolarizing impact of elastic collisions is properly taken into account in the calculations .",
    "since the relevant pumping radiation field here is that of the continuum radiation , whose anisotropy factor is significantly larger above the granule cell centers than above the intergranular lanes ( see figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed @xmath0 profile of the lithium doublet ( which lacks spatio - temporal resolution ) must be significantly biased towards the granule cell centers .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the inferred magnetic field strength would be more representative of the magnetization of the granular plasma .",
    "obviously , new and very careful observations of this extremely weak polarization signal are urgently needed . in this respect , it is of interest to mention that our colleagues from the istituto ricerche solari locarno ( irsol ) , dr .",
    "m. bianda and dr .",
    "r. ramelli , have already initiated such an observational program with the zrich imaging polarimeter ( zimpol ) attached to the gregory coud telescope of irsol .",
    "although some of the @xmath0 profiles they have been able to measure with such an excellent facility for high - sensitivity spectropolarimetry seem to show a one - peak profile , many more observations are needed in order to fully clarify what type of @xmath0 profiles the sun is actually producing in the lithium doublet and in order to use them for diagnostic purposes .",
    "the authors wish to thank dr .",
    "roberto casini for providing a code that has been very useful for the computations contained in section  4.1 .",
    "one of us , eld , wishes to express his gratitude to the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) for finantial support that facilitated a sabatical stay at the iac during 2009 .",

    "<S> high - sensitivity measurements of the linearly - polarized solar limb spectrum produced by scattering processes in quiet regions of the solar atmosphere showed that the @xmath0 profile of the lithium doublet at 6708   has an amplitude @xmath1 and a curious three - peak structure , qualitatively similar to that found and confirmed by many observers in the na  i d@xmath2 line . given that a precise measurement of the scattering polarization profile of the lithium doublet lies at the limit of the present observational possibilities , it is worthwhile to clarify the physical origin of the observed polarization </S>",
    "<S> , its diagnostic potential and what kind of @xmath0 shapes can be expected from theory . to this end , we have applied the quantum theory of atomic level polarization taking into account the hyperfine structure of the two stable isotopes of lithium , as well as the hanle effect of a microturbulent magnetic field of arbitrary strength . we find that quantum interferences between the sublevels pertaining to the upper levels of the d@xmath2 and d@xmath3 line transitions of lithium do not cause any observable effect on the emergent @xmath0 profile . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical calculations show that only two @xmath0 peaks can be expected , with the strongest one caused by the d@xmath2 line of @xmath4li  i and the weakest one due to the d@xmath2 line of @xmath5li  i. interestingly , we find that these two peaks in the theoretical @xmath0 profile stand out clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin atmospheric region that produces the emergent spectral line radiation is lower than 4000 k. the fact that such region is located around a height of 200  km in standard semi - empirical models , where the kinetic temperature is about 5000  k , leads us to suggest that the most likely @xmath0 profile produced by the sun in the lithium doublet should be slightly asymmetric and dominated by the @xmath4li  i peak . </S>"
