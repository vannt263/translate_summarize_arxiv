    "in recent years the edge states of two dimensional topological insulators ( 2d tis ) , showing the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect , have been subject of attention from the condensed matter community.@xcite these states have been theoretically predicted in graphene layers with spin - orbit interaction @xcite and strained semiconductors @xcite and experimentally observed in mercury - telluride quantum wells .",
    "@xcite their most relevant feature is the helicity @xcite , namely the fact that opposite spins propagate in opposite directions along the same edge .",
    "as far as time reversal symmetry is preserved , the backscattering between these different spin channels is indeed suppressed .",
    "@xcite + till now various proposals have been made in order to extract information about the helical nature of the edge states and their stability by means of transport measurements , including the investigation of the kondo effect @xcite , the analysis of peculiar geometries like the corner junction @xcite and the study of possible backscattering processes involving only one edge .",
    "@xcite in the simple quantum point contact ( qpc ) geometry @xcite signatures of helicity and electron - electron interactions can be found in the power - law behavior of the spin current as a function of the source - drain voltage in a two terminal configuration .",
    "@xcite    recently , also interferometric setups , similar to the ones that have already provided hints about the existence of fractional charge and fractional statistics in the framework of the quantum hall ( qh ) effect@xcite , have been proposed .",
    "@xcite in the context of qsh effect , the existence of two spin direction , with a defined helicity makes the interferometric properties of the four terminal setup , shown in fig.[fig1 ] , much richer . the fact that edge states with opposite spins , and belonging to different boundaries , are constrained to be close at the qpcs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , activates a local spin - orbit coupling that can be modeled phenomenologically by a spin - flipping tunneling term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the presence of a spin - flipping tunneling ( sf ) term , apart the usual spin - preserving ( sp ) one , has deep consequences on the interferometric properties of the set - up .",
    "in fact , if the spin is preserved during tunneling , the electron reverses its direction of propagation giving rise to `` fabry - prot '' ( f - p ) interference phenomenon when traveling along the c losed loop shown in fig . [ paths ] , while if the electron flips its spin during the tunneling , it keeps moving in the same direction giving rise to `` aharonov - bohm '' ( a - b ) interference phenomenon , where the role of the f - p or a - b flux is played by the sum or the difference of the external gate voltages coupled to top and bottom edges .",
    "@xcite let us note that the a - b - like effect is absent in qh interferometers , since electrons are polarized by strong magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , differently from qh interferometers , in qsh ones , f - p and a - b effects can be controlled independently , permitting to generate pure charge or pure spin currents by all electrical means.@xcite + two important issues which have not been widely investigated in such interferometer setups are the role and strength of interactions within edge channels and the role of the local spin - orbit interaction which determine the sf contributions to the current .",
    "the novelty of this work relies indeed on this twofold extension of previous analysis . from one side , in comparison with ref .",
    "we consider a fully electrical set - up which is very versatile and allows to analyze the f - p and the a - b contribution to the current in a totally independent way avoiding possible drawback related to the presence of magnetic field .",
    "moreover , in comparison with refs .",
    "we investigate the interacting case that reveals by far not trivial at all and requires the introduction of totally different techniques with respect to the scattering matrix approach previously taken into account .",
    "+ to address these questions , in our work we propose to realize an interacting quantum pump@xcite with the interferometric setup of fig.[fig1 ] where the time - dependent modulation of the point contacts potentials allows to change the ratio between the sp and the sf contribution to the current . differently from other proposals ( see ref . ) , the relative strength of the two contributions to tunneling currents is not determined by the constriction geometry , but can be conveniently controlled by tuning the forcing signals .",
    "one of the effects we find is the different behavior , with respect to the pumping frequency , of two modulating functions characterizing the spin - preserving and the spin - flipping contribution to the current .",
    "moreover by means of the pump , spin currents are generated and controlled fully electrically .",
    "we will show that the behavior of the spin current , in particular the period of oscillation and the position of the zeros , is determined by the strength of the interactions , as well as the values of the f - p and a - b phases .",
    "this will allow us to find a way to extract information about the strength of interactions from the analysis of interference patterns .",
    "since the setup is full electrically controllable , the study of the effects of the interactions can be carried out in a variety of different scenarios that could be investigated in future experiments . + the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> we study parametric quantum pumping in a two - dimensional topological insulator bar in the presence of electron interactions described by an helical luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the pumping current is generated by two point contacts whose tunneling amplitudes are modulated in time . the helical nature of the edge states of the system ensures the generation of a pumped spin current that is determined by interference effects related to spin - flipping or spin - preserving tunneling at the quantum point contacts and which can be controlled by all electrical means . we show that the period of oscillation and the position of the zeros of the spin current depend on the strength of the electron interactions , giving the opportunity to directly extract information about them when measured . </S>"
