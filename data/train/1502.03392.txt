    "the ground state of exotic fermion cooper pairing with mismatched fermi surfaces is a longstanding problem in the theory of superconductivity  @xcite . in electronic superconductors ,",

    "@xmath1-wave pairing at weak coupling , it is known that , at a critical field @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pairing gap at vanishing mismatch , a first - order phase transition from the gapped bcs state to the normal state occurs  @xcite .",
    "further theoretical studies showed that the inhomogeneous larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) state can survive in a narrow window @xmath4 , where the upper critical field @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , since the thermodynamic critical field is much lower than @xmath6 due to strong orbit effect , it is rather hard to observe the loff state in ordinary superconductors @xcite .",
    "in recent years , experimental evidences for the loff state in some superconducting materials have been reported  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "exotic pairing phases have promoted new interest in the studies of dense quark matter under the circumstances of compact stars @xcite and ultracold atomic fermi gases with population imbalance @xcite .",
    "color superconductivity in dense quark matter appears due to the attractive interactions in certain diquark channels  @xcite . because of the constraints from beta equilibrium and electric charge neutrality , different quark flavors ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath1 ) acquire mismatched fermi surfaces .",
    "quark color superconductors under compact - star constraints as well as atomic fermi gases with population imbalance therefore provide rather clean systems to realize the long - sought exotic loff phase .    around the tricritical point in the temperature - mismatch phase diagram",
    ", the loff phase can be studied rigorously by using the ginzburg - laudau ( gl ) analysis since both the gap parameter and the pair momentum are vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "it was found that the solution with two antipodal wave vectors is the preferred one @xcite .",
    "however , the real ground state of the loff phase is still debated due to the limited theoretical approaches at zero temperature .",
    "so far rigorous studies of the loff phase at zero temperature are restricted to its 1d structures including the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state with a plane - wave form @xmath9 and the larkin - ovhinnikov ( lo ) state with an antipodal - wave form @xmath10 .",
    "a recent self - consistent treatment of the 1d modulation @xcite show that a solitonic lattice is formed near the lower critical field , and the phase transition to the bcs state is continuous . near the upper critical field",
    "the gap function becomes sinusoidal , and the transition to the normal state is of first order .",
    "in addition to these 1d structures , there exist a large number of 3d crystal structures .",
    "the general form of a crystal structure of the order parameter can be expressed as @xmath11 a specific crystal structure corresponds to a multi - wave configuration determined by the @xmath12 unit vectors @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . in general , we expect two competing mechanisms : increasing the number of waves tends to lower the energy , but it may also causes higher repulsive interaction energy between different wave directions . in a pioneer work ,",
    "bowers and rajagopal investigated 23 different crystal structures by using the gl approach  @xcite , where the grand potential measured with respect to the normal state was expanded up to the order @xmath15 , @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the density of state at the fermi surface and the pair momentum fixed at the optimal value @xmath18 . among the structures with @xmath19 , the favored one seems to be the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "further , it was conjectured that the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) with @xmath21 @xcite is the preferred structure since its @xmath22 is negative and the largest  @xcite . for bcc structure ,",
    "the gl analysis up to the order @xmath15 predicts a strong first - order phase transition at @xmath23 with the gap parameter @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the prediction of a strong first - order phase transition may invalidate the gl approach itself . on the other hand , by using the quasiclassical equation approach with a fourier expansion for the order parameter , combescot and mora  @xcite predicted that the bcc - normal transition is of rather weak first order : the upper critical field @xmath25 is only about @xmath26 higher than @xmath27 with @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "if this result is reliable , it indicates that the higher - order expansions in the gl analysis is important for quantitative predictions .",
    "to understand this intuitively , let us simply add the eighth - order term @xmath30 to the gl potential ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the influence of a positive @xmath31 on the phase transition is presented in appendix a. we find that with increasing @xmath31 , the first - order phase transition becomes weaker and the upper critical field @xmath25 decreases .",
    "for @xmath32 , the phase transition approaches second order and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , to give more precise predictions we need to study the higher - order expansions and the convergence property of the gl series , or use a different way to evaluate the grand potential without assuming a small value of @xmath34 .    for a specific crystal structure given by ( [ crystal ] ) , it is periodic in coordinate space . as a result ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the fermionic excitation spectrum in this periodic pair potential , which is known as the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation , is in analogy to the schrdinger equation of quantum particles in a periodic potential .",
    "this indicates that the fermionic excitation spectrum has a band structure , which can be solved from the bdg equation .",
    "the grand potential can be directly evaluated once the fermionic excitation spectrum is known @xcite . in this work , we present a solid - state - like calculation of the grand potential of the bcc structure .",
    "our numerical results show that the phase transition from the bcc state to the normal state is of rather weak first order , consistent with the work by combescot and mora  @xcite .",
    "this implies that it is quite necessary to evaluate the higher - order terms in the gl expansion to improve the quantitative predictions .",
    "to be specific , we consider a general effective lagrangian for two - flavor quark pairing at high density and at weak coupling .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by  @xcite @xmath35\\psi+{\\cal l}_{\\rm int},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the two - flavor quark field and @xmath37 is the quark dispersion with the momentum operator @xmath38 . in the momentum representation",

    "notice that we have neglected the antiquark degree of freedom because it plays no role at high density and at weak coupling .",
    "we have also neglected the color and spin degrees of freedom , which simply give rise to a degenerate factor .",
    "color superconductivity is characterized by nonzero expectation value of the diquark field @xmath45 . for the purpose of studying inhomogeneous phases",
    ", we set the expectation value of @xmath46 to be static but inhomogeneous , i.e. , @xmath47 . with the nambu - gorkov spinor @xmath48",
