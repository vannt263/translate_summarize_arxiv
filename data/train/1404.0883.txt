    "phase transitions and critical phenomena are central topics in the research of complex networks because of their deep implications in dynamical processes  @xcite .",
    "recently , explosive , i.e. , very sharp , phase transitions have garnered a great deal of attention from scientists , first arising in the context of network percolation  @xcite .",
    "while these transitions were eventually proven to be continuous , and thus not explosive  @xcite , interest in abrupt phase transitions was reignited in the context of synchronization  @xcite .",
    "synchronization has long served as a major tool in studying emergent collective behavior in ensembles of coupled dynamical agents  @xcite , with examples found in nature , e.g. , rhythmic flashing of fireflies  @xcite and mammalian circadian rhythms  @xcite , in engineering , e.g. , power grids  @xcite and oscillations of pedestrian bridges  @xcite , and at their intersection , e.g. , synthetic cell engineering  @xcite . in particular , the kuramoto model has served as a paradigm for both modeling and understanding synchronization  @xcite . when placed on a network ,",
    "the kuramoto model consists of an ensemble of @xmath0 phase oscillators , @xmath1 for @xmath2 , whose evolution is governed by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the natural ( intrinsic ) frequency of oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the global coupling strength , and the adjacency matrix @xmath7 $ ] encodes the network topology that defines the oscillators interactions .    in 2011 , gmez - gardees et al .",
    "@xcite found that for sufficiently heterogeneous network topologies ( e.g. , those generated with the barabsi - albert preferential attachment model  @xcite ) a simple degree - frequency correlation defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the degree of node @xmath5 , induces an explosive phase transition in the order parameter @xmath10 , defined by @xmath11 as the coupling strength @xmath6 is varied . in particular , @xmath12 represents the centroid of all oscillators when placed on the complex unit circle , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 indicating incoherent and synchronized behavior , respectively .",
    "such explosive synchronization is characterized by the emergence of a range of coupling strengths where incoherent and synchronized states are both stable , unlike the first - order transition studied in ref .",
    "subsequently , significant attention has been paid to the further exploration of degree - frequency correlations  @xcite and in particular explosive synchronization  @xcite .",
    "while this research has augmented our understanding of explosive synchronization and its relationship with dynamical and structural correlations , in each case strong conditions are necessarily imposed on either the heterogeneity of the network , its link weights , or its initial construction to engineer first - order phase transitions .",
    "this raises the following question : how robust is the phenomenon of explosive synchronization in the view of more realistic dynamical and structural properties ? in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that explosive synchronization can be induced in both real and synthetic networks by the addition of quenched disorder to the oscillators frequencies .",
    "in particular , the resulting networks consist of oscillators whose frequencies are correlated with , but not precisely determined by , local structural properties ; a property one might expect to find in many real - world situations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , explosive synchronization is not only robust to , but moreover promoted by , this very natural mechanism .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we assume that the randomness @xmath16 for each oscillator @xmath5 is independent from all other oscillators and for simplicity assume that it is drawn from the uniform distribution @xmath17 .",

    "we interpret each link in the network to be undirected and unweighted , i.e. , the adjacency matrix @xmath20 is symmetric and @xmath21 if a link connects nodes @xmath5 and @xmath22 , otherwise @xmath23 .    in figs .",

    "each profile is obtained by first slowly increasing , then slowly decreasing @xmath6 . for each value of @xmath6",
    "we simulate a long transient to reach steady state then average @xmath10 over a significant amount of time .",
    "we note the following interesting behavior .",
    "first , in the absence of disorder ( @xmath24 ) the transition from incoherent to synchronized dynamics is second - order , i.e. , not explosive , and relatively mild . for @xmath25",
    "the transition becomes much sharper , however remains second - order .",

    "thus , for a network whose transition to synchronization is second - order in the absence of disorder , a sufficient amount of disorder induces explosive synchronization .",

    "otherwise , @xmath41 never reaches a fixed point , indicating that oscillator @xmath5 drifts for all time .    to classify the degree of synchronization we now inspect the local order parameters . in principle",
    ", the contribution to each local order parameter can be divided into that from the phase - locked and drifting oscillators , i.e. , @xmath43 , however for simplicity we neglect the drifting contribution and consider only the contribution of locked oscillators satisfying @xmath40 . in appendix  [ appb ]",
    "we present a derivation for the contribution of the drifting oscillators , but note here that we find this contrition is second - order in comparison to that of the locked oscillators .",
    "thus , we approximate each local order parameters as @xmath44 noting that we sum only over neighbors that satisfy the phase - locking criteria .",
    "next we make two additional simplifying approximations regarding the local order parameters .",
    "first , we assume that all the local average phases are approximately equal , i.e. , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 pairs .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption given that a single synchronized cluster exists , as is typically the case for networks without strong modular structure .",

    "both assumptions have been used and numerically validate in previous synchronization studies  @xcite and are predicted to be most accurate for networks with relatively large mean degree , such that fluctuations in the local averages sufficiently diminish .",
    "it can also be shown that the constant @xmath47 is a good approximation for the global degree of synchronization @xmath10 , and thus we approximate @xmath49 . in appendix  [ appc ]",

    "<S> we study explosive synchronization , a phenomenon characterized by first - order phase transitions between incoherent and synchronized states in networks of coupled oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> while explosive synchronization has been the subject of many recent studies , in each case strong conditions on either the heterogeneity of the network , its link weights , or its initial construction are imposed to engineer a first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of how robust explosive synchronization is in view of more realistic structural and dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that explosive synchronization can be induced in mildly heterogeneous networks by the addition of quenched disorder to the oscillators frequencies , demonstrating that it is not only robust to , but moreover promoted by , this natural mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we support these findings with numerical and analytical results , presenting simulations of a real neural network as well as a self - consistency theory used to study synthetic networks . </S>"
