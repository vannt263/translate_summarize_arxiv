    "our starting point in discussing gravitational lensing ( hereafter gl ) is fermat s potential @xcite , @xcite .",

    "namely , fermat s potential @xmath0 is fixed when we have determined the surface mass density @xmath1 normalized by @xmath2  .",
    "@xmath0 depends on the cosmological large scale structure through @xmath2 whereas @xmath1 does on the lens models .",
    "the former problem is , for instance , concerned with the information of inhomogeneity of the universe , dyer - roeder distance , cosmological parameters , etc .",

    ", we may consider a variety of elliptical lens models that have different power dependence of distance in mass distribution .",
    "however their analytical surveys are not tractable and dedicated to numerical calculations . on the other hand , multipole expansion model seems to be rather tractable .    in any case , the more models are sophisticated , the more parameter space gets complicated .",
    "parameters are , for instance , mass , finite core size , ellipticity , multipole moments and their angles , etc .",
    "such parameters are fixed to reproduce the observed quantities such as image positions , image amplifications and time delays between several images .",
    "however such parameter fitting becomes ambiguous and best fitting may not be unique in models with many parameters .",
    "even if parameters had been fitted uniquely , it does not mean systematic understanding of gl .",
    "more concretely speaking , observed data are biased in many cases by complicated unknown reasons .",
    "for instance , observed image amplifications are disturbed by the dust lying between the source and observer . also the magnitude of such disturbance may be different in the respective light path . in that case",
    "it is not necessarily reliable that we fit the parameters naively to the raw observed data .",
    "these problems are rather common to the observed cosmology .",
    "however they are especially serious in gl , since we have no confirmed physical meaning in mass distribution model of lensing objects .",
    "so we need some strategy for searching the universal structure of gl that is irrelevant to models and boundary conditions .",
    "this is another problem  formulation problem .",
    "we apply catastrophe theory(ct ) @xcite for such strategy .",

    "2 we argue general framework of singularities of caustics in complex coordinates , which is applied to the concrete models in subsequent sections . in  3 we discuss multipole expansion model .",
    "we will see how ct work in gravitational lensing .",
    "however it is indispensable to consider the transition of singularities analytically for that purpose .",
    "these analyses are confirmed by numerical calculations in  4 and applied to the real multiple quasar system . in the last section we consider elliptical lens model and see the consistency with the multipole expansion model .",
