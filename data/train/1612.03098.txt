    "quantum systems with fluctuating stripe order have received an increasing attention of the condensed matter community in the last years@xcite .",
    "different quasi - two - dimensional systems such as quantum hall systems@xcite , cuprates and iron - based superconductors@xcite as well as heavy fermion compounds@xcite present inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic electronic / spin structures at very low temperatures .",
    "a common feature of these systems is the possible existence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) separating phases that break translational and/or rotational symmetries@xcite .    with growing temperature stripe patterns melt , typically by the proliferation of dislocations and disclinations .",
    "the theory of thermal melting of stripes is reasonable well understood@xcite . when quantum flutuations play a role , as in the electronic systems cited above",
    ", the phenomenology of anisotropic phases may be much more complex than in the corresponding thermal , or classical counterpart . on general grounds",
    "it is expected that upon lowering the temperature a crossover must occur between thermal and quantum dominated fluctuations .",
    "eventually , quantum fluctuations may be responsible for a true @xmath9 quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the behavior of thermodynamic and electronic transport properties must be strongly influenced by the proximity of the qcp , and then it is important to characterize the different possible universality classes of quantum phase transitions@xcite .",
    "a quantum theory of stripe melting which can account for this rich phenomenology is still under development .    a model for continuous stripe quantum melting in metals , driven by a particular type of topological defects , double dislocations",
    ", was recently proposed in connection with the physics of cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "this model considers the simultaneous presence of charge and spin stripes . as a consequence",
    ", it is argued that single charge stripe dislocations ( which would lead to frustration in the spin stripes ) remain gapped , justifying that the physics of charge stripe melting should be mainly governed by the proliferation of double dislocations . upon disordering ,",
    "this leads to a `` stripe loop metal '' phase , different from the usual fermi liquid phase . when spin order is not considered , the model leads to similar results as we reach in the present study , which only deals with one type of degrees of freedom .    in the context of quantum hall phases ,",
    "the condensation of lattice defects was recently studied@xcite .",
    "a very general framework of a gauge field theory of quantum liquid crystals at @xmath9 in continuum space has also been proposed and recently reviewed in [ ] .",
    "another context in which the results of the present work can be relevant is the field atomic gases@xcite and in particular in ultra - cold dipolar fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of ultra - cold atom systems is progressing rapidly and promises to be an ideal testing ground for the physics of quantum strongly correlated systems .",
    "several electronic liquid crystalline phases are predicted to be present in these systems  @xcite .",
    "recently the thermal melting of two dimensional dipolar fermi gases was addressed in [ ] .",
    "when all the dipoles are at a generic tilting angle @xmath10 with respect to the @xmath11 plane of the system , the thermal melting of stripes is found to be driven by the proliferation of dislocations , leading to an effective anisotropic @xmath12 model , which then allows to predict the elastic and critical properties straightforwardly .",
    "nevertheless , for tilting angle @xmath13 , i.e. when all dipoles are oriented perpendicular to the @xmath11 plane , the system recovers rotation invariance on the plane , and then long range stripe order is forbiden at finite @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "while longe range positional order is forbidden , orientational order of stripes survives to dislocations proliferation , leading to a nematic - like phase  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show that , for dipolar interactions in a rotationally symmetric system , only quasi - long - range nematic order in the orientation of stripes is possible at finite temperatures .",
    "it is worth mention that while most properties of a quantum phase transition are dictated by symmetry , dynamical properties depend essentially on microscopy . in the context of fermi liquids ,",
    "landau damping could produce over - damped modes with dynamical exponent @xmath15@xcite near the isotropic - nematic phase transition . in the presence of a tetragonal lattice , ising - nematic fluctuations could renormalize the dynamical exponent as well@xcite , which adds to the complexity of the observed phenomenology .",
    "the emergent phenomenology related with striped phases is supposed to come from the competition between short range attractive interactions and long range repulsive ones@xcite at a microscopic level .",
    "in this perspective , the relevance of residual long range interactions is an interesting and important problem and , to the best of our knowledge , an open one .",
    "for instance , in quantum hall systems , it is known that long - range coulomb interactions change the nature of the smectic phase@xcite . moreover , in the context of charge cold atoms , coulomb as well as dipole interactions play a relevant role@xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of long ranged interactions in classical two - dimensional stripe melting was considered@xcite .",
    "it was shown that , consistent with common assumptions , for sufficiently short - ranged interactions , positional correlations are short ranged while a kosterlitz - thouless transition from an isotropic to a quasi - long - range nematic phase takes place .",
    "interestingly , it was found that for sufficiently long - ranged repulsive interactions a second order phase transition occurs between a disordered isotropic phase and a truly long - range orientationally ordered nematic phase .",
    "this result implies that , for classical models , the lower critical dimension depends on the range of the interaction : the larger the range of the repulsive interaction , the smaller the lower critical dimension .    in this work",
    "we extend the approach to orientational phases in systems with long ranged competing interactions to the realm of quantum melting of stripe patterns .",
    "the starting point is a coarse - grain effective hamiltonian for isotropic , competing short range and long range interactions which decay with distance as @xmath0 .",
    "this action is a well known continuum limit of a large family of truly microscopic hamiltonians , and in this sense the connection of our results with specific microscopic models is straightforward",
    ". then , starting from the well known stripe ground states of the effective model , we promote the displacement field of the stripe modulation to a quantum time dependent operator , introduce dislocations and obtain the relevant dispersion relations for the quantum elasticity theory with long range competing interactions . at finite temperatures the mean squared fluctuations of the displacement field diverge with the size of the system independently of the range of interactions , and then positional order can be strictly short ranged , a result well known in models with short range interactions .",
    "a more interesting scenario emerges for the orientational degrees of freedom which are stable to gaussian fluctuations .",
    "then , after introducing dislocations , the relevant topological defects in stripe forming systems , we consider the interaction between two far apart portions of the striped pattern through a multipolar expansion of the relevant density ( electronic or magnetic density ) .",
    "this leads to a model of quantum rotors in the plane of the system with generalized dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "analysis of this model shows that , when temperature fluctuations dominate over quantum ones , the well known kosterlitz - thouless type phase transition driven by disclination unbinding is restricted to sufficiently short ranged competing interactions , @xmath7 .",
    "if the interactions are long ranged enough , @xmath16 , a genuine second order phase transition to a phase with long range orientational order may exist at finite @xmath14 .",
    "at @xmath9 the conclusions from the quantum elastic theory are different : for sufficiently weak quantum fluctuations the mean square fluctuations of the displacement field may be finite , while they diverge for strong enough fluctuations .",
    "this precludes the existence of a quantum phase transition from a smectic - like phase to a nematic - like one at a critical value of the strength of quantum fluctuations . in the context of a mcmillan - degennes theory",
    "this phase transtion turns to be of first order for @xmath17 and second order for sufficiently long range repulsive interactions @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , at higher values of the quantum fluctuations , orientational order also breaks down leading to a fully disordered phase . for short range interactions , @xmath7 ,",
    "the quantum nematic - isotropic transition in @xmath18 is in the universality class of the thermal xy model in @xmath19 . for sufficiently long ranged interactions , @xmath16 , the critical exponents depend continuously on the interaction range .",
    "finally , the critical line emerging from the quantum critical point at the @xmath9 isotropic - nematic transition is obtained for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "no critical line emerges from the nematic - smectic transition point because positional order is completely absent at finite temperatures .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : generaltheory ] we briefly introduce the model for competing interactions at different scales and proceed in subsection [ sec : melting ] to a presentation of the quantum elastic theory of stripe melting in a pedagogical way . in subsection",
    "[ sec : rotors ] we introduce the model of quantum rotors in the plane , from which most of the results will be extracted .",
    "then , in section [ sec : criticality ] we describe the main results for the isotropic - nematic phase transitons at @xmath9 .",
    "two subsections describe , respectively , the behavior for @xmath7 and @xmath16 . complementing the discussion of the @xmath9 phase diagram , in section [ sec : smectic ]",

    "thermal ] the results for the finite @xmath14 phase diagrams are presented for both @xmath7 and @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath23 is a repulsive long ranged isotropic interaction which decays as a power law of the distance in the form @xmath24 .",
    "although it is convenient to work with an arbitrary exponent @xmath5 , physically relevant examples are the coulomb interaction in charged systems ( @xmath2 ) and the dipolar interaction between out - of - plane magnetic moments ( @xmath4 ) in magnetic films .",
    "additionally , entropic contributions generate a local potential @xmath25 which , for simplicity , we consider to be a degenerate double well potential of the form @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    ", the system tends to form condensate states , with @xmath30 . due to the ising symmetry ,",
    "both condensates are equally probable and the system tends to phase separate .",
    "the long range repulsion @xmath31 frustrates this tendency and the ground state ends being inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic . the simplest and most commonly found configuration of this type is a unidirectional modulation characterized by a single wave vector @xmath32  @xcite . in this case , the order parameter can be written in the form @xmath33 , where the fourier coefficients @xmath34 determine the profile of the modulation .",

    "a typical configuration is illustrated in figure [ fig : stripes ] .",
    "the shaded area represents regions with @xmath40 while in the white regions @xmath41 .",
    "the fourier spectrum @xmath34 can be computed , in principle , using a mean - field approximation . when expressed in terms of @xmath42",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) reads  @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the energy of the unperturbed stripes configuration , @xmath45 is the fourier transform of @xmath46 and the @xmath47 s are stiffness coefficients .",
    "@xmath48 measures the local elastic response of the stripes to compression or elongation of the pattern , while @xmath49 is the local elastic response to bending of the stripes .",
    "@xmath50 comes from the long range repulsive interaction , which generates a non local interaction between far apart pairs of layers , as illustrated in fig.[fig : stripes ] .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the non local term results irrelevant in the long wave - length limit for @xmath51 , but becomes important when @xmath52 .",
    "thus , it is equivalent to use the simpler model hamiltonian : @xmath53 which interpolates between the different possible cases . for @xmath52 , the long range tail of the repulsive interaction dominates at long wave - lengths and consequently the sigma depending term must be kept . on the other hand , for fast enough decaying repulsive interaction ( @xmath51 ) the appropriate @xmath54 contribution",
    "is recovered by just fixing @xmath55 .",
    "building upon the classical effective hamiltonian ( [ heff1 ] ) , which has already been studied in , our goal is to build a theory of quantum stripe melting , where quantum fluctuations are considered in the same foot as thermal fluctuations , and long range interactions are appropriately taken into account .",
    "the well known classical theory of stripe melting  @xcite has to be recovered as the high temperature limit of the present formalism when @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath56 represents an elastic displacement field , it is natural to see the modes @xmath45 of this field as phonons .",
    "this context justifies the use of a path integral approach to treat the quantum fluctuations of the field .",
    "accordingly , we promote the displacement field adding an imaginary time coordinate @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary time slab extends from zero to @xmath58 .",
    "intertwined with the assumption that the normal modes are phonons it is the assumptions that the quantum field @xmath59 posses a kinetic energy quadratic in the `` velocity '' @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the action for the quantum problem reads : @xmath61 , \\label{qs1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 measures the strength of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the equality below the time integral indicates that the quantum action is constrained to periodic realizations of the field @xmath42 along the imaginary time direction .",
    "now , defining the fourier transform of the field @xmath63 in the imaginary time direction in the form @xmath64 with the frequencies given by @xmath65 satisfying the periodicity condition in the interval @xmath66 $ ] , the action ( [ qs1 ] ) can be recast as : @xmath67 this is a gaussian action for which the correlator is : @xmath68 from this we can obtain the mean square fluctuations ( msf ) of translation and orientation degrees of freedom at a gaussian level , which inform us on the stability of the possible phases in a system of stripes , depending on the range of the repulsive interaction @xmath5 , the strength of quantum fluctuactions and temperature .",
    "the msf of the displacement field @xmath42 is given by : @xmath69 additionally , considering that in the small deviation limit the angular orientation of the stripe pattern is given by @xmath70 , we get for the msf of the angular orientation : @xmath71 for finite temperatures @xmath72 one can conclude that positional order is always short ranged . even at zero quantum fluctuations ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "the msf of the displacement field diverges with the linear size of the system for any @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "orientational order is always stable within the gaussian approximation , for weak enough quantum fluctuation ( @xmath73 ) and low enough temperature ( @xmath74 ) while , for high enough temperature or strong enough quantum fluctuations the orientational fluctuations diverge . under such conditions",
    "some orientational phase transition is expected at intermediate values of @xmath14 and @xmath62 .",
    "this picture may change ( and indeed changes ) under the effects of topological excitations  @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "the main difference is that the msf of the displacement field becomes finite for weak enough quantum fluctuations , independently of the value of @xmath5 . on the other hand , for strong enough quantum fluctuations ( @xmath75 )",
    "the msf of the displacement field diverges , which suggest the existence of a quantum phase transition at some intermediate value of the strength of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "we will discuss the nature of the quantum smectic - nematic phase transition in section [ sec : smectic ] .",
    "the picture obtained at a gaussian level is at least incomplete since no phase transitions are detected , even when they are expected . in the following",
    ", we will complete the description by inclusion of relevant topological defects , specially dislocations , which are essential to obtain qualitatively correct phase diagrams .    in a stripe system ,",
    "a dislocation can be seen as a pair of stripes of opposite densities coming to an end in the middle of the stripe pattern , see fig.[fig : dislocation ] .     when the integration path encloses the dislocation core .",
    "the length of the dashed line corresponds to the value of the line integral .",
    "the parameter `` @xmath76 '' corresponds to the modulation length of the stripe pattern @xmath77 . ]",
    "the strength of a dislocation is characterized by the line integral over a closed counterclockwise path around the dislocation core , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : dislocation ] .",
    "the double arrowhead signals the difference in the number of stripes at the top and the bottom of the drawn contour .",
    "this condition is expressed in the form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an integer number and @xmath76 stands for the modulation length .",
    "it is important to realize that , differently from the general case , in the case under study an odd number of stripes ( layers ) can not form dislocations , otherwise the natural tendency of the system to create a modulated symmetrical pattern would be violated and consequently this will cost too much energy .",
    "this means that although usually the parameter @xmath76 represents the width of a single layer , in our case as we are forced to add pairs of layers it represents the whole modulation length .",
    "we will see in what follows that this particular feature has important implications for the dynamical properties of the system .",
    "also , it is known that normally dislocations can not move in an arbitrary way inside a crystal .",
    "specifically , due to the so called `` glide constraint '' , dislocations are forbidden to climb inside the crystal , which would imply that they can not move along the stripe direction .",
    "such movement inside a crystal would imply the existence of points in which the particles are destroyed or created , which obviously violates mass conservation .",
    "however in the present case dislocations are formed by a certain number of layer pairs with opposite densities , which means that the translation of a dislocation core along the stripe pattern maintains a constant local average of the order parameter , implying that the total mass or charge of our system is not affected by this kind of motion .",
    "the euler equation for the initial action ( [ eq : qs2 ] ) is : @xmath80 this equation has to be solved subject to the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , considering that at any time @xmath81 $ ] the integration contour is chosen encircling the dislocation .",
    "this is not immediate since there is nt a smooth and single valued solution for this problem .",
    "the way out is to introduce cuts across which @xmath82 jumps discontinuously . following usual conventions we take this cut going from the dislocation center to infinity along the _ y _ axis ( fig.[fig : dislocation ] ) .",
    "the displacement @xmath83 should present a discontinuity of value @xmath84 when crossing the cut . considering this and the form in which the operators in the euler equation act near the cut",
    ", we realize that a source term of the form @xmath85 should be added at the right hand of equation ( [ eq : eu1 ] ) in order to obtain a single valued solution satisfying condition ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) .",
    "this source term considers a moving dislocation with trajectory given by @xmath86 .",
    "after this the displacement field is given by : @xmath87 from which one can read the green function for a single dislocation : @xmath88    the next step is to generalize the previous result to a system of interacting dislocations . promoting the delta density of a single dislocation to the case of a field of dislocations ,",
    "the displacement can be written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is given by ( [ eq : gk1 ] ) .",
    "now , the complete elastic action can be written in the symmetric form : @xmath91 where the component fields are given by : @xmath92 introducing the cut into the function @xmath93 in order to make it single valued leads to the appearance of spurious infrared divergences in @xmath94 and @xmath95 when @xmath96 .",
    "this issue is a known fact in the classical theory of stripe melting  @xcite .",
    "the solution comes from the observation that , while the displacement field @xmath82 posseses a discontinuity of magnitude @xmath97 for all @xmath98 , the order parameter , which is proportional to @xmath99 , is a smooth function",
    ". then , it is safe enough to neglect these divergent terms .",
    "after this , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are given by : @xmath102 finally , to complete the construction of the effective action for the interacting dislocations field @xmath103 , it is important to include the cost of an isolated dislocation @xmath104 , which is not taken into account in the long wave - length contribution of the displacement field .",
    "this yields : @xmath105 where @xmath106 represents the dislocation core diameter , and serves as a short distance cut - off for the effective action .",
    "now , remembering that for small layer deviations the orientation angle of the stripes is @xmath107 , the orientational correlator is @xmath108 which , to leading order in the long wavelength ( @xmath109 ) and low temperature ( @xmath110 ) limits , leads to : @xmath111 this is a generalization of the corresponding results for classical smectic systems  @xcite when one includes the effects of long range repulsive interactions and quantum fluctuations . from here",
    "it is straightforward to infer the form of the corresponding orientational action : @xmath112 in order to study critical properties of the stripe system , we would like to build the most general effective action that preserves local rotational symmetry , having the action ( [ eq : so ] ) as the one obtained in the spin wave approximation .",
    "to this end , instead of tracking back the effect of the higher order contributions in the original action , which could be rather intricate , one can rebuild the full orientational hamiltonian considering the symmetries of the stripe pattern . to identify the real symmetries of the system",
    "we should notice that the basic cell of any stripe system is composed by a double layer of opposite densities with a small longitudinal width , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] . in principle",
    ", any low energy configuration of the system of stripes can be built from these basic cells . in reference a model which takes into account the interactions between near and distant striped cells was introduced . in the next section we will discuss the qualitative aspects of the model in more detail , stressing the particular choice of observables for the identification of the different phase transitions .",
    "the orientation of each basic cell can be defined by means of a local director vector @xmath113 . in general , the director @xmath114 points perpendicular to the iso - density curves @xmath115 , and in the case of sharp interfaces it is peaked at the domain walls as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] .",
    "however , it is simple to realize that stripe configurations have no vectorial order since , integrating over the whole sample , @xmath116 .",
    "notice that in two adjacent domain walls the directors always point in opposite directions .",
    "moreover , if @xmath114 is globally rotated by @xmath117 , the final state is exactly de same as the original one",
    ". therefore , the orientational order is generally characterized by a quadratic function of @xmath114 , say a symmetric traceless tensor @xmath118 , where the index @xmath119 refers to two orthogonal directions .",
    "this is a nematic order parameter , which by construction is invariant under global rotations by @xmath117 .",
    "an orientationally ordered phase is characterized by @xmath120 , while for a completely disordered ( isotropic ) phase , @xmath121 . to completely characterize possible phase transitions",
    "it is necessary to compute fluctuations : @xmath122 . from a technical point of view",
    ", this is a difficult calculation since it is a four point correlation function , @xmath123 . from a physical point of view",
    ", this means that the nematic order parameter is not obtained as a linear response to an homogeneous external field but instead it is necessary to compute a quadratic response . within this approach ,",
    "the minimum approximation to compute the nematic order parameter is the `` self consistent screening approximation '' , where infinite sets of two - loop diagrams can be computed self consistently  @xcite .",
    "here we propose an alternative observable to characterize the isotropic - nematic phase transition  @xcite .",
    "note that in the stripe phase , the directors are ordered in an `` antiferromagnetic '' structure .",
    "each block of two adjacent domain walls are characterized by two directors pointing in opposite directions and separated by half a stripe period .",
    "thus , the system is structured in two interpenetrated sub - lattices , both of them ferromagnetically ordered with opposite directions .",
    "we can define a _",
    "sub - lattice director _ @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the sub - lattice index .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sublattice ] . then , similarly to what is done to describe antiferromagnetic order , it is useful to work with two linear cobinations of the sub - lattice directors @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the stripe period . in the stripe phase @xmath128 ,",
    "reflecting the fact that there is no dipolar or vector order . in turn , the staggered order parameter , eq .",
    "( [ eq : stagger ] ) , reflects the vectorial order of one of the sub - lattices , @xmath129 .",
    "it can be noted that if @xmath130 the system is orientationally ordered . for the sake of characterizing the isotropic - nematic phase transition one can work either with the tensor order parameter @xmath131 or with the vector one , @xmath132 .",
    "both of them characterize the same phase transition . on the other hand",
    ", the critical exponents can be quite different because @xmath131 and @xmath132 are different observables . while @xmath131 is a quadratic response to an external uniform field , @xmath132 is a linear response to a staggered conjugate field . in this sense ,",
    "the latter is easier to compute since it is a linear function of the density gradient @xmath133 . from the point of view of the symmetry ,",
    "the nematic order is characterized by its invariance under rotations by @xmath117 .",
    "this is obvious in the tensor order parameter since @xmath134 is a quadratic function of @xmath114 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath132 changes sign under rotation by @xmath117",
    ". however , form eq .",
    "( [ eq : stagger ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] it is clear that a change of sign in @xmath132 represents a change from high density ( shaded areas ) to low density ( white areas ) regions , and vice - versa .",
    "then , @xmath132 and @xmath135 represent the same state in the thermodynamic limit , as it should be . to describe the nematic transition using the staggered director",
    "we will assume that one sub - lattice is slaved to the oder .",

    "of course , it could contain non - quadratic local terms that we will treat perturbatively in a renormalization group approach .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath141 and @xmath142 will be defined later in terms of the stripe melting parameters such as the stripe stiffness and dislocation s energy .    to evaluate the contribution of the long ranged interactions we start by coarse graining the system , covering the plane with small rectangles of area @xmath143 with @xmath144 , centered at positions @xmath145 corresponding to a domain - wall sub - lattice as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] .",
