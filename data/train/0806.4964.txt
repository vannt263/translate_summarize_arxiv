    "martin et al .",
    "@xcite studied a simple model , in which they included a 1d inhomogeneous pair potential varying on an arbitrary length scale @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing , and argued for an increase of the critical temperature with inhomogeneity , with a maximum enhancement obtained for @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coherence length of the analog homogeneous system .",
    "similar results were obtained by loh and carlson , where they found however that an increase in the transition temperature occurred at the cost of reduced superfluid density @xcite .",
    "aryanpour et al .",
    "@xcite performed a systematic numerical study of @xmath6-wave superconductivity on checkerboard , stripe and random patterns of pairing potentials in an attractive hubbard model ; they also found a positive correlation between critical temperature and inhomogeneity for many situations .",
    "it is also known that models with enhanced @xmath1 and significant inhomogeneity are associated with unusual features in electronic structure .",
    "for example , recent calculations of high - quality ultrathin s - wave superconducting films have shown that the surface - driven inhomogeneity can enhance @xmath1 due to weakly dispersive low - energy subgap states in the system@xcite .",
    "the above studies were primarily considerations of bcs type models .",
    "recently , however , tsai et al.@xcite have studied small size repulsive hubbard models with a  checkerboard \"- like",
    "modulation of hopping matrix elements using exact diagonalization , and also concluded that the inhomogeneous models could lead to pairing at very high binding energy scales .",
    "nunner et al .",
    "@xcite underlined the importance of this phenomenon for cuprates by explaining many of the correlations between the measured local gap and other observables in bi-2212 by assuming a @xmath7-wave pairing interaction @xmath8 varying on a unit cell size , and driven by dopant disorder .",
    "if the effective pair interaction can vary on an atomic scale , and the bcs coherence length is sufficiently short , one can imagine situations where in a complex periodic crystal with large unit cell the pairing interaction varies over an atomic length scale in the absence of disorder , i.e. a periodic , modulated @xmath8 , which will give rise to a periodic , modulated order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the properties of such a system are important to understand , because it represents the simplest type of nanoscale pairing modulation , and one may study the relationship between superconducting properties and inhomogeneity easily .",
    "aryanpour et al .",
    "@xcite considered systems of this type within a purely numerical approach , and obtained a variety of interesting results .",
    "nevertheless , in such a treatment it is sometimes difficult to extract simple conclusions and understand exactly which aspects of superconductivity are really enhanced or suppressed by inhomogeneity , and why .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the simplest such model , a bipartite lattice in two dimensions with two different values of @xmath10 on two interpenetrating sublattices . the homogeneous version of the model has a superconducting ground state on a bipartite lattice in arbitrary dimension and filling @xcite . here",

    "we distinguish however two cases : one , where both @xmath10 s have the same sign ; and a second , where they differ .",
    "situations like the latter case where the pairing potential changes sign abruptly over a unit cell distance have been considered in the impurity context @xcite , but not in periodic cases , and it is not clear whether true superconducting solutions can exist in such a situation .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce the sublattice pairing model and give exact expressions for the order parameter and critical temperature @xmath1 within the generalized bcs scheme .",
    "we show that @xmath1 can indeed be enhanced by detuning the coupling constants from the bcs point @xmath14 .",
    "we then derive in section iii the quasiparticle excitations and thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "when the average pairing strength is held constant but inhomogeneity is increased , the model displays a shrinking spectral gap in the total dos . in the case of opposite sign coupling constants ,",
    "the excitation spectrum becomes gapless , and the mean field solution corresponds to an order parameter which oscillates in sign from point to point . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the superfluid density @xmath15 for the model , and show that for the case of same - sign coupling constants inhomogeneity preserves a robust @xmath15 at @xmath0 . in the case of opposite signs , however , @xmath15 is suppressed by the onset of a residual normal fluid .",

    "we have presented and solved a simple mean - field model of a superconductor with inhomogeneous pairing varying on an atomic scale .",
    "the model simply takes a different value for pairing on each of two interpenetrating sublattices .",
    "the inhomogeneity can be increased while keeping the average pairing in the system fixed , thus allowing the effect of inhomogeneity on various properties to be discussed .",
    "many results for this model were presented in analytic form .",
    "as pointed out by earlier workers , we find that increasing pairing inhomogeneity enhances @xmath1 .",
    "we have presented analytical results reflecting this effect , and calculated the spectrum and thermodynamic properties as well .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath1 is accompanied by a closing of the spectral gap and eventually by the appearance of gapless phase in the quasiparticle spectrum of the  @xmath6-wave \" superconductor .",
    "while these results have been obtained at the mean field level , because the length scale of the variation of the pairing interaction is so short we do not expect fluctuations to change them significantly @xcite , at least until the superfluid density is substantially suppressed .",
    "the last caveat does not seem to be particularly restrictive , however .",
    "the enhanced @xmath1 found in the inhomogeneously paired system is accompanied by a reduction in condensation energy , but the system maintains a constant @xmath0 superfluid density until a critical value of the inhomogeneity , when a level crossing of two quasiparticle energies forces the system into the gapless phase . until this point ,",
    "the condensate at @xmath0 is spatially homogeneous for any value of the interaction inhomogeneity , even when the interaction on a given sublattice is zero ; this reflects the strong proximity coupling between the sublattices . as inhomogeneity increases further",
    ", we have argued that the decrease in the superfluid density leads fairly rapidly to a decrease in the phase ordering temperature ; we find , therefore , that the optimal inhomogeneity is reached close to the checkerboard pattern of interactions , with attractive pairing on one sublattice and zero on the other .",
