    "in the last years the study of the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its extensions , like the renormalized quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) , has received renewed attention .",
    "the goal was to improve substantially the reliability of the qrpa description of nuclear double beta decay transitions and , at the same time , to enhance the predictive power of the theory in an unambiguous way .",
    "the predictive power of the qrpa , mostly in dealing with the calculation of the matrix elements for ground state to ground state two - neutrino double - beta decay transitions ( @xmath0 ) , is questionable since these amplitudes are extremely sensitive to details of the nuclear two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of renormalized particle - particle correlations in the qrpa matrix amounts to a drastic suppression of the @xmath1 -matrix elements .",
    "however , for some critical values of the model parameters ; i.e : the renormalized two - body interactions , the otherwise purely real qrpa eigenvalue problem becomes complex . as a consequence of it the standard properties of the qrpa metric and conservation rules are severely downplayed by the appearance of strong ground - state correlations which jeopardize the stability of the theory .",
    "the most notorious example of this behaviour , of the qrpa approach , is the calculation of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath2 @xcite .    the renormalized version of the qrpa ( rqrpa)@xcite , which includes some corrections beyond the quasiboson approximation , has been recently reformulated @xcite and applied to the @xmath0 decay problem @xcite .",
    "contrary to the qrpa , the rqrpa does not collapse for any value of the residual two - body interaction . based on its properties ,",
    "the rqrpa was presented as a cure for the instabilities of the qrpa and it was applied to calculations of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "similar studies have been performed in the framework of the rqrpa and with the inclusion of proton - neutron pairing correlations in symmetry breaking hamiltonians .",
    "@xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that the rqrpa violates the ikeda sum rule and that this violation is indeed present in many extensions of the qrpa .",
    "the study was based on the schematic proton - neutron lipkin model .    in a subsequent letter",
    "@xcite we have introduced an exactly solvable model for the description of single- and double - beta decay fermi - type transitions .",
    "this model is equivalent to a single - j shell model for protons and neutrons .",
    "the appearance of an eigenvalue at zero energy , in the exact spectrum , was found .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the presence of this zero - energy eigenvalue should be associated to the collapse of the qrpa .",
    "it was shown that the rqrpa does not include this zero - energy mode in its spectrum .",
    "it was also shown that the absence of this zero - energy state , in the rqrpa , leads to finite but spurious results for the transition amplitudes near the point of collapse of the qrpa .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the details of the exactly solvable model of @xcite .",
    "the algebraic techniques needed to evaluate matrix elements of the relevant operators , in the so(5 ) group - representation , are described in detail .",
    "exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors are compared with those corresponding to the quasiparticle version of the hamiltonian ( qp ) and with the ones obtained with the qrpa and rqrpa .",
    "the role of the correlations induced by the scattering term h@xmath3 of the qp - hamiltonian and the effects on the number of quasiparticles in the ground state are analyzed .",
    "the presence of a zero excitation energy state in the spectrum corresponding to the exact solution of the model hamiltonian is discussed . as said before it will be shown that the rqrpa and the qp solutions , do not display the same feature , most likely due to the presence of spurious states caused by the mixing of orders , of the relevant interaction terms , in the expansion procedure .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : the model and its solutions are presented in section 2 , the quasiparticle version of the hamiltonian , its linear representation in terms of pairs of unlike ( proton - neutron ) quasiparticle - pairs and its properties are introduced in section 3 .",
    "the qrpa and rqrpa treatments of the hamiltonian are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the matrix elements of double - beta - decay transitions , calculated in the framework of the different approximations introduced in the previous sections , are given in section 5 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "the so(5 ) algebra , representations and reduced matrix elements used in the calculations are given in detail in the appendices a , b and c , respectively .",
    "the model hamiltonian , which includes a single particle term , a pairing term for protons and neutrons and a schematic charge - dependent residual interaction with both particle - hole and particle - particle channels , has been introduced in refs . @xcite and it is given by    @xmath4    with @xmath5    @xmath6 being the particle creation operator and @xmath7 its time reversal .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 play the role of the renormalization factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 introduced in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in a series of papers @xcite that this hamiltonian , when treated in the framework of the qrpa , reproduces fairly well the results obtained with a realistic g - matrix constructed from the bonn - obep potential , both for single- and double - beta decay transitions .",
    "these results can be taken as an indication about the correlations induced by the interactions in ( 1 ) , which are obviously specific to the relevant degrees of freedom of the problem .",
    "in other words , if the relatively simple schematic force ( 1 ) can approximately described the correlations induced by a more realistic interaction it certainly means that it is able to pick - up the bulk of the physics involved in the transitions .    in a single - one - shell limit , for the model space ( @xmath12 ) and for monopole ( @xmath13 ) excitations the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can be solved exactly . in spite of the fact that the solutions obtained in this restricted model space can not be related to actual nuclear states , the excitation energies , single- and double - beta decay transition amplitudes and ground state correlations depend on the particle - particle strength parameter @xmath14 in the same way as they do in realistic calculations with many single particle levels and with more realistic interactions , as we shall show later on .",
    "physically , the beta decay transitions between @xmath15 states correspond to transitions of the fermi type . however , the study of the model and the identification of its relevant degrees of freedom , instead of the comparison of observables , is the main aspect of the present work .",
    "we shall obtain the eigenstates of ( 1 ) , by using different approximations , in order to built - up a comprehensive view about the validity of them and their predictive power .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamex ] ) can be expressed in terms of the generators of an so(5 ) algebra @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space is constructed by using the eigenstates of the particle - number operator @xmath16 , the isospin @xmath17 and its projection @xmath18 .",
    "the raising and lowering isospin operators are defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . with them we can construct the isospin scalar @xmath21 and the second order so(5 ) casimir ( see appendix a )    @xmath22    with @xmath23 .    the hamiltonian ( [ hamex ] ) can be expressed in terms of the above mentioned operators .",
    "hereafter we will use @xmath24 for simplicity . in terms of these generators the hamiltonian ( 1 ) reads    @xmath25 { \\frac { \\cal",

    "the hamiltonian mixes states with different isospin @xmath34 while its eigenstates still have definite @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamical breaking of the isospin symmetry is an essential aspect of the model which is directly related to the nuclear structure mechanism responsible for the suppression of the matrix elements for double - beta - decay transitions .      the solution of ( 1 ) in the basis @xmath38 , in the case @xmath37 , gives a state , the isobaric analog state ( ias ) at the energy    @xmath39    considering a double fermi - transition , the energy available for the decay is given by    @xmath40    where @xmath41 .",
    "the above expression shows clearly the role of the particle - hole strength parameter @xmath8 .",
    "it determines the excitation energy of the ias , which depends not only upon the proton - neutron energy shift due to the nuclear coulomb field but also upon @xmath8 and @xmath42 .",
    "the same dependence is shown by the @xmath43 ( eq.(7 ) ) .",
    "in analogy with the situation found in realistic calculations its value can be determined by a fit to the experimental value of the ias energy ( or to the gamow - teller giant resonance for the case of @xmath44 spin - isospin - dependent excitations ) .",
    "the @xmath45 decay operators for single fermi transitions , @xmath46 , do not change the total isospin neither the total particle number of the state upon which they act .",
    "only the isospin projection of the state is changed in steps of one unit , namely :    @xmath47      for the numerical examples we have selected @xmath48 and a large value of @xmath49 to simulate the realistic situation found in medium- and heavy - mass nuclei . to perform the calculations we have adopted the following two sets of parameters :    @xmath50",
    "the dependence of the spectrum and transition matrix elements on the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 is analyzed in the following paragraphs .    *",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "1a and fig .",
    "2a , for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as a function of the number of protons ( z ) .",
    "the states are labeled by the isospin quantum numbers @xmath54 .",
    "ground states are shown by thicker lines .",
    "as shown in these figures the structure of the mass parabola is qualitatively reproduced .",
    "the upper insert , case a ) of each figure , shows the full spectrum corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "the lower one , case b ) , shows the results corresponding to @xmath56 ( fig 1.b ) and @xmath57 in ( fig 2.b ) .",
    "obviously the particle - hole channel of the residual interaction stretches the spectra of all isotopes . as mentioned above , it increases the energy of the ias .",
    "beta decay transitions of the fermi type , mediated by the action of the operator @xmath58 , are allowed between states belonging to the same isospin multiplet .",
    "the energy of each member of a given multiplet increases linearly with @xmath59 .    in this example",
    "the @xmath51 states belonging to each odd - odd - mass nuclei ( n-1 , z+1 , a ) are the ias constructed from the @xmath51 states of the even - even - mass nuclei with ( n , z , a ) nucleons . thus , fermi transitions between them are allowed .",
    "since the isospin of the ground state of each of the even - even - mass nuclei differs , for different isotopes , fermi - double - beta - decay transitions connecting them are forbidden in this diagonal limit @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamex ] ) has a @xmath60 tensorial component which mixes states with different isospin , while particle number and isospin projection remain as good quantum numbers .",
    "the diagonalization of ( 1 ) is performed in the basis of states described in the appendix b. the corresponding reduced matrix elements are given in the appendix c. the eigenstates are written as :    @xmath61    * fig . 3 *    the energy of the ground - state ( @xmath62 ) and of the first - excited state ( @xmath63 ) , as a function of the ratio @xmath64 for the set of parameters @xmath65 are shown if fig .",
    "the results of fig.3b have been obtained with the set of parameters given by @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the most characteristic feature of the results is the barely avoided crossing of levels , due to the repulsive nature of the effective residual interaction between them .",
    "although a complete level - crossing is not obtained in this model , in the neighbourhood of the value @xmath68 a major structural change in the wave functions will develope . in the case of a complete crossing of levels",
    "the ground and the first excited state will interchange their quantum numbers thus given raise to a permanently deformed ( in the sense of the isospin dominance ) situation .",
    "this behaviour is by no means a surprise since it is similar to that found in pairing plus quadrupole systems @xcite . in this case , if the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction is strong enough , the system becomes permanently deformed , in the sense of the angular momentum and spatial rotations .",
    "the analogy between this and the present case ( isospin degree of freedom ) can be drawn from the study of @xcite where the `` pairing plus monopole '' model , which is a two - level model exactly solvable using the so(5 ) algebra , was used to analyzed the spherical and the deformed regime of the solutions of the multipole - multipole interaction .    the full - thin line of fig .",

    "it is clear that when @xmath76 attractive proton - neutron correlation dominates over proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing correlations and the excitation energy goes to zero .",
    "similar results are depicted in figs . 5a and 5b , corresponding to the excitation energy @xmath69 of the lowest @xmath51 state in the odd - odd mass nucleus ( @xmath77 ) , also measured from the ground state of the parent even - even nucleus with ( @xmath78 ) , for @xmath79 and @xmath67 ( @xmath80 ) . in the case of",
    "fig.5 the excitation energy goes to zero when @xmath81 .",
    "the vanishing of the energy of the first excited state , and the subsequent inversion of levels ( or negative excitation energies ) would indicate that the double - odd nucleus becomes more bound than their even - even neighbours , contradicting the main evidence for the dominance of like - nucleons pairing in medium- and heavy - mass nuclei .",
    "it would also completely suppress the double beta decay because the single beta decay from each `` side '' of the double - odd nucleus would be allowed .",
    "these result simply emphasizes the fact that the hamiltonian ( [ hamex ] ) will not be the adequate one when attractive proton - neutron interactions are too large . in a realistic situation ,",
    "obviously , the true hamiltonian includes other degrees of freedom , like quadrupole - quadrupole interactions , and permanent deformations of the single - particle mean - field can also be present .",
    "these additional degrees of freedom will prevent the complete crossing of levels which , of course , is not observed",
    ". however , in many cases the experimentally observed energy - shift of double - odd - mass nuclei , respect to their double - even - mass neighbours is very small .",

    "the solutions of this truncated hamiltonian have been discussed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of hamiltonian ( [ hambcs ] ) requires the use of the same algebraic techniques involved in solving the original hamiltonian .",
    "however , the complexity of the problem increases severely , due to the fact that neither the quasiparticle number or the quasiparticle isospin projection ( or equivalently the number of proton and neutron quasiparticles ) are good quantum numbers .",
    "it implies that the dimension of the basis will increase by two orders of magnitude .",
    "additional reduced matrix elements would then be needed to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hambcs ] ) .",
    "the analytic expressions of these matrix elements are given in appendix c.    there is a remaining symmetry in hamiltonian ( [ hambcs ] ) , since states with even number of proton- and neutron - quasiparticles are not connected with states having an odd number of them .",
    "due to this fact it is possible to diagonalize separately these two cases .",
    "particle number is not a good quantum number , obviously , because it is broken spontaneously by the bogolyubov transformation .",
    "thus , zero - quasiparticle states belonging the even - even - mass nucleus have good average number of protons and neutrons , the condition used to determine @xmath98 , while states with a non - vanishing number of quasiparticles show strong fluctuations in the particle number .",
    "fluctuations in the particle number can induce , naturally , important effects on the observables .",
    "moreover , the admixture of several quasiparticle - configurations in a given state , induced by residual particle - particle interactions , can also strongly influence the behaviour of the observables .",

    "the excitation energies for the linearized hamiltonian @xmath109 are shown as thick lines in these figures .",
    "we can see that the linearized hamiltonian is able to reproduce qualitatively the behaviour of the full - qp one , but in general it overestimates the values of the excitation energies .",
    "as it is mentioned above , the results shown in figures 4 and 5 have been obtained both with the complete qp - hamiltonian and with the truncated hamiltonian which includes only the product of pair - creation and annihilation- operators . in @xcite",
    "the relevance of the scattering terms in ( [ hambcs ] ) was pointed out . from the present results",
    "it can be seen that the inclusion of these terms is indeed important if one looks after a better description of the qp - excitation energies , up to the point where the exact excitation energies become negative . for larger values of @xmath9",

    "the difference between both approximations is evident . using the linearized hamiltonian the states",

    "is far - away for the qp vacuum , and has a structure which can be described as a full quasiparticle shell .",

    "a state with four proton and four neutron quasiparticles has very large number - fluctuations .",
    "spurious states become strongly mixed with physical states . in this way the resulting excitation energies average to zero , a limit which differs from the exact value , which is negative .",
    "the differences in the average qp number between full - qp and linearized approaches are larger in figs.6.a ) and 6.b ) than in figs.7.a ) and 7.b ) .",

    "thus , the full - qp and linearized solutions yield similar results .",

    "we can refer to pair of fermions ( @xmath130 ) or to quasi - bosons ( @xmath136 ) without lost of generality , since we have not introduced a particular representation for the pair of fermions to boson mapping .",

    "it can be seen that in the four cases displayed in these figures the collapse of the qrpa values occurs near the point where the exact excitation energies become negative .",
    "this is a very important result because it means that that the qrpa description of the dynamics given by the hamiltonian ( [ hamex ] ) is able to reproduce exact results . at this point",
    "one can naturally ask the obvious question about the nature of the mechanism which produces such a collapse .",
    "the fact that the qrpa approximation is sensitive to it , together with the fact that the same behaviour is shown by the exact solution , reinforces the idea about the onset of correlations which terminate the regime of validity of the pair - dominant picture . in order to identify such correlations",

    "the structure of the ground state is included explicitly @xcite , in the form @xmath148|0\\rangle } } \\hspace{.3cm}.\\ ] ] where the quasi - boson approximation , at commutator s level , is not enforced explicitly .",
    "the renormalization procedure consists of retaining approximately the number of quasiparticle - like - terms of the commutators keeping them as a parameter to be determined , namely , by defining the rqrpa one - phonon state as @xmath149 / \\langle 0| [ a , a^\\dagger ] |0\\rangle^{1/2 } |0\\rangle\\ ] ]    and enforcing the condition @xmath150 , which leads to the estimate @xmath151 for the parameter entering in the definition of the correlated vacuum . after some algebra it is possible to show that @xmath152|0\\rangle   \\equiv d   = 1 - { \\frac { 2 { \\cal y}^2 d } { 2j+1 } } $ ] @xcite , and that @xmath153^{-1}.\\ ] ]    the rqrpa submatrices are @xmath154 and @xmath155 . since @xmath156 , the presence of @xmath157 multiplying both @xmath158 and @xmath159 produces the reduction of the residual interaction which is needed to avoid the collapse of the qrpa equations @xcite . due to this fact the rqrpa energy @xmath160 is always real .",
    "its value can be obtained by solving simultaneously the non - linear equations for @xmath161 and @xmath157 , which in the general case will include all possible values of the multipolarity @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "rqrpa excitation energies are shown in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "these results strongly resemble those of fig . 1 of ref . @xcite and fig . 2 of ref .",
    "the results corresponding to the qrpa ( of ref.@xcite ) and to the rqrpa ( of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are quite similar to those shown in figures 4 and 5 . however , the main finding of the present calculations is that the exact excitation energies are closer to the qrpa energies , rather than to the renormalized ones , instead . in exact calculations including the spin degrees of freedom",
    "a phase transition was found at the point where the qrpa collapses @xcite , thus reinforcing the present results .",
    "the average number of quasiparticles in the rqrpa vacuum is given by @xmath162    and it is shown in fig .",
    "6.a ) , 6.b ) , 7.a ) , and 7.b ) .",
    "it is fairly obvious , from these results , that the rqrpa ground state correlations double in all the cases those of the complete solutions of the linearized hamiltonian .",
    "this is clearly an overestimation , and it is probably one of the most notorious difficulties confronting the use of the rqrpa .",
    "it allows too much ground state correlations , and with them the particle number fluctuations are introducing spurious states which can dominate the low energy structure for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "near `` collapse '' the average number of quasiparticles given by the qrpa and the rqrpa are comparable . for the case of the qrpa the increase of the ground - state - correlations",
    "is determined by the change in the sign of the backward - going matrix relative to the forward - going one near collapse . from there on the qrpa can not produce any physically acceptable result since one of the underlying conditions of the approximation , i.e : the positive definite character of either linear combination of the forward- and backward - going blocks of the qrpa matrix will not be fulfilled .",
    "this collapse is prevented in the rqrpa , by the use of the renormalization of the matrix elements , but the drawback of the approximation is the contribution coming from spurious states , which ought to be removed .",
    "moreover , there are several other reasons to cast doubts on the consistency of the rqrpa . among them , the mixing - up of orders in the wave functions , of the rqrpa phonons , is not accompanied by the the enlargement of the hamiltonian , to accommodate other correlations , like : i.e : the exchange terms of the qrpa matrix .",
    "if one performs such a calculation , by including exchange terms , the resulting values of the qrpa matrix terms are also `` renormalized '' , but this effect will depend upon the configurations . also , the point of collapse is shifted to higher values of the coupling constant @xmath9 but the effect is tipically of the order @xmath163 , as compared to leading order terms .",
    "if terms others than unity are introduced in the commutators , then the hamiltonian has to be enlarged to account for the @xmath164 sort of terms of the initial hamiltonian , see eq.(11 ) , because they will contribute at the same order as the added number - type of terms introduced by the rqrpa procedure .",
    "thus , the rqrpa procedure should be accompanied by a renormalization of the transition operators and/or by the inclusion of scattering terms also in these operators . at this level , by going beyond the leading order qrpa approximation , more terms have to be added to the diagrams which represent the transition amplitudes .",
    "it has been done for a pure seniority model in @xcite .",
    "this approach , for correlations between pairs of like - quasiparticles , is already cumbersome and it introduces an unmanageable number of contributions , both to the qrpa matrix as well as to the transition operators . for unlike - pairs of quasiparticles",
    "the situation can be even worse , since the complete algebra , which supports the expansions , can not be defined in a subspace where scattering terms are replaced by c - numbers .",
    "more details about these aspects will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in this section we shall briefly discuss some of the consequences of the previously presented approaches on the calculation of nuclear double - beta decay observables . in the following",
    "we shall focus our attention on the two - neutrino mode of the nuclear double - beta decay , since the matrix elements governing this decay mode are more sensitive to nuclear structure effects than the ones of the neutrinoless mode .",
    "as said in the introduction we shall consider only double - fermi transitions .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements of the two - neutrino double - beta - decay @xmath165 can be written as : @xmath166    where @xmath167 and @xmath168 represent the initial , intermediate and final nuclear states participant of the virtual transitions entering in the allowed second - order weak - processes .",
    "the energies of the initial and intermediate states are @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "the energy released by the decay is represented by the quantity @xmath171 . for the present calculations",
    "we have selected the value of @xmath172 , which is of the order of magnitude of the empirical values used in realistic calculations .",
    "the results for the matrix elements @xmath165 , obtained with the exact wave functions are shown , as a function of the ratio @xmath173 , in figs .",
    "8.a ) and 8.b ) .",
    "these results have been obtained with the following set of parameters : @xmath174 and @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "the values shown in figs .",
    "9.a ) and 9.b ) correspond to @xmath177 and @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "8,9 *    for all cases the exact value of @xmath165 vanishes at the point @xmath180 .",
    "as mentioned above , this cancellation appears in the model due to the fact that for this value of @xmath9 the isospin - symmetry is recovered and the ground states of the initial and final nuclei belong to different isospin multiplets , as it can be seen also from the results shown in figs . 1 and 2 .    a similar mechanism , in the context of a solvable model possessing a so(8 ) algebra including spin and isospin degrees of freedom was used a decade ago to show that the cancellation of the @xmath165 matrix elements for certain values of the particle - particle residual interaction was not an artifact of the qrpa description @xcite .",
    "the results corresponding to the matrix elements @xmath165 , calculated with the different approximations discussed in the text are shown in figs.8 and 9 , as a function of the coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "the values of @xmath165 are very similar to those found in realistic calculations @xcite , including its strong suppression for values of the coupling constant @xmath9 near the value which produces the collapse of the qrpa description .",
    "distinctively , the rqrpa results extends to values of @xmath9 passing the `` critical '' value .",
    "however , the validity of this result can be questioned because , as we have shown above , the rqrpa missed the vanishing of the excitation energy .",
    "the @xmath165 matrix elements , evaluated with the complete qp - hamiltonian ( [ hambcs ] ) , is quite similar to that of the rqrpa up to point where it vanishes . from this point - on the results of both the full - qp and the rqrpa approximations are different .",
    "both matrix elements change their sign at a value of @xmath9 which is larger than the one corresponding to the change of the sign of the matrix elements calculated with the exact wave function .",
    "the fact that the rqrpa results and the ones of the qp - approximation are similar , although these models differ drastically in the correlations which they actually include , suggest that a kind of balance is established between terms which are responsible for ground state correlations and those which produce the breaking of coherence in the wave functions . obviously this mechanism must be related to the presence of scattering terms in the commutators as well as in the hamiltonian .",
    "an exactly solvable model for the description of single- and double - beta- decay - processes of the fermi - type was introduced .",
    "the model is equivalent to a complete shell model treatment in a single - j shell for the adopted hamiltonian .",
    "it reproduces the main features of the results obtained in realistic calculations , with many shell and effective residual interaction , like those used in the literature to describe the microscopic structure of the nuclei involved in double beta decay processes .",
    "we have constructed the exact spectrum of the hamiltonian and discussed its properties .",
    "the results concerning the energy of the states belonging to the exact solution of the model show that , in spite of its very schematic structure , the hamiltonian is able to qualitative reproduce the nuclear mass parabola .",
    "the sequence of levels of the exact solution shows that the ground - state and the first - excited state , of the spectrum of double - even nuclei , approach a band - crossing situation for a critical value of the strength associated to attractive particle - particle interactions . at the crossing these states",
    "interchange their quantum numbers .",
    "this behaviour is connected with the description of `` shape '' transitions in similar theories , where the order parameter is clearly associated with multipole deformations in r - space . in the present model",
    "the `` deformation '' mechanism is related with the breaking of the isospin symmetry and the space - rotation correspond to a rotation in isospin - space which preserves the third - component of the isospin .",
    "we have compared the exact values of the excitation energy and of the double - beta - decay matrix elements , for double - fermi transitions , with those obtained by using the solutions of the approximate qp - hamiltonian , its linearized version and both the qrpa and rqrpa ones .",
    "it was shown that the collapse of the qrpa correlates with the presence of an exact - eigenvalue at zero energy .",
    "the structure of the rqrpa solutions has been discussed and it was found that though finite they are not free from spurious contributions .",
    "the role of scattering - terms was discussed and they were shown to be relevant in getting excitation energies closer to the exact values . however they are not enough to generate the correlations which are needed to produce the band - crossing , or negative excitation energies , as it was found in the exact solution for large values of the coupling constant @xmath9 .    in order to correlate the break - up of the qrpa approximation with the onset of strong fluctuations in the particle number we have calculated the average number of quasiparticles in the different approximations discussed in the text .    it was shown that the solutions of the complete qp - hamiltonian display a strong change in the structure of the ground state when the particle - particle strength increases .",
    "the qp - content of the ground state varies from a nearly zero - value to an almost full qp - occupancy .",
    "the particle number fluctuations associated with states with a large number of quasiparticles were mentioned as a possible source of spurious states .",
    "double beta decay amplitudes were evaluated in the different formalisms .",
    "their similitudes and differences were pointed out .    as",
    "a conclusion the need of additional work , to clarify the meaning of the different approximations possed by the rqrpa , was pointed out .",
