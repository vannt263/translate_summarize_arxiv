    "for example , bounded cohomology depends only on the fundamental group of the space in question  ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * , theorem  4.3 ) , bounded cohomology can not see amenable normal subgroups of the fundamental group  ( * ? ? ?",

    "more generally one can ask how bounded cohomology and @xmath0-homology are related and whether there is some kind of duality . in the present article , we investigate to what extent such a duality holds .",
    "a convenient framework for this problem is the language of normed and banach chain complexes , i.e. , chain complexes of ( complete ) normed vector spaces whose boundary operators are bounded operators . unlike taking algebraic duals of @xmath1-chain complexes , taking topological duals of banach chain complexes fails to commute with homology ( section  [ linkingsubsec ] ) .",
    "however , by exploiting the power of mapping cones , we prove in section  [ translproofsubsec ] the following replacement for the universal coefficient theorem :    [ linkthm ] let @xmath2 be a morphism of banach chain complexes and let @xmath3 be its dual .    1 .",
    "then the induced homomorphism  @xmath4 is an isomorphism of vector spaces if and only if @xmath5 is an isomorphism of vector spaces .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath5 is an isometric isomorphism , then also @xmath6 is an isometric isomorphism .    in this article ,",
    "the main examples for banach ( co)chain complexes are the @xmath0-chain complexes and bounded cochain complexes of spaces and of discrete groups respectively : the @xmath0-chain complex  @xmath7 of a topological space  @xmath8 is the @xmath0-completion of the singular chain complex of  @xmath8 with @xmath1-coefficients and @xmath0-homology of  @xmath8 is defined to be the homology of this chain complex ; dually , the bounded cochain complex  @xmath9 of  @xmath8 is the topological dual of  @xmath7 and bounded cohomology of  @xmath8 is defined to be the cohomology of  @xmath9 .",

    "applying the translation principle to suitable chain maps in the realm of @xmath0-homology enables us to transfer many results concerning bounded cohomology to @xmath0-homology .",

    "3 .   there is a description of @xmath0-homology of spaces in terms of homological algebra ; namely , @xmath0-homology of connected , countable -complexes coincides with @xmath0-homology of the fundamental group , and hence @xmath0-homology of such spaces can be computed via certain strong relatively projective resolutions ( corollary  [ l1coeffcoro ] ) .",

    "however , due to a gap in her argument , her proof is not complete .",
    "this issue is addressed in caveats  [ amenablecaveat ] and  [ strongcaveat ] , which also show that it is not possible to imitate ivanov s arguments in bounded cohomology in the setting of @xmath0-homology .",
    "the results listed above might give the impression that @xmath0-homology is merely a shadow of bounded cohomology .",
    "however , there are also genuine applications of mology : for example , the simplicial volume of non - compact manifolds is not finite in general  it can even then be infinite if the manifold in question is the interior of a compact manifold with boundary . in this case , @xmath0-homology gives rise to a necessary and sufficient finiteness condition ( theorem  [ fincritthm ] ) , which can not be phrased in terms of bounded cohomology .      in section  [ normedchsec ]",
