    "due to a relation between the allen - cahn equation and the theory of minimal surfaces ( see  @xcite ) , every level set of a global minimizer of should converge at infinity in some weak sense to the boundary of a minimal set minimal in the variational sense , that is , minimizing perimeter .",

    "in @xmath116 and higher dimensions , there exist minimal sets different than half - spaces the simplest example being the simons cone .",
    "the analogue for the allen - cahn equation of the first of these two results is well understood . indeed , a deep theorem of savin  @xcite states that in dimensions @xmath115 , @xmath117d solutions ( i.e. , solutions depending only on one euclidean variable ) are the only global minimizers of the allen - cahn equation .",
    "note that this result makes no assumption on the monotonicity or limits at infinity of the solution .",
    "that is :    [ teosavin ] assume that @xmath115 and that @xmath19 is a global minimizer of @xmath118 in @xmath114 .",
    "then , the level sets of @xmath19 are hyperplanes .",
    "however , the analogue for the allen - cahn equation of the second statement ( i.e. , the minimality of the simons cone when @xmath34 ) is not yet understood .",
    "that is , the possible minimality in @xmath116 ( or at least in higher dimensions ) of the saddle - shaped solution is still unknown .",
    "this question was already raised in 2002 by jerison and monneau  @xcite .    *",
    "open question 1.7 . * is the saddle - shaped solution a global minimizer of the allen - cahn equation in @xmath45 for @xmath34 , or at least in higher even dimensions ?",
    "related to this , in @xmath119 it is known the existence of a global minimizer to the allen - cahn equation which is not @xmath117d ( i.e. , with level sets different than hyperplanes ) .",
    "this is the solution in @xmath119 , monotone in the @xmath120 variable , constructed by del pino , kowalczyk , and wei  @xcite .",
    "since this monotone solution is known to have limits @xmath39 as @xmath121 , a result of alberti , ambrosio , and the author @xcite guarantees that the solution is indeed a global minimizer .    in this direction ,",
    "a positive answer to the open question  1.7 above would give an alternative way to that of @xcite to prove the existence of a counter - example to the conjecture of de giorgi in @xmath119 .",
    "indeed , saddle - shaped solutions are even functions of each coordinate @xmath122 . thus , by a result of jerison and monneau  @xcite , if the saddle - shaped solution were a global minimizer in @xmath45 , then the conjecture of de giorgi on monotone solutions would not hold in @xmath123 . indeed , from the 1d solution depending only on @xmath124 and from a global minimizing saddle - shaped solution depending only on @xmath125 , @xcite constructs in a natural way a solution in @xmath123 which is monotone in the last variable @xmath124 and which is not 1d .",

    "the rest of this section is devoted to prove proposition  [ mpholds ] .",
    "for this , recall that the typical way towards establishing the maximum principle for an operator @xmath133 in an open set @xmath59 is to first show that @xmath143 if this holds , then adding one of various additional assumptions on @xmath144 ( the simplest one being @xmath145 with @xmath131 a positive constant ) , it does guarantee the maximum principle to hold ; see @xcite . indeed , in bounded domains , is a necessary and `` almost '' sufficient condition for the maximum principle to hold ; see corollary 2.1 of @xcite .",
    "however , in unbounded domains one has to be more careful to deal with infinity .",
    "recall that when @xmath19 is a saddle - shaped solution of , @xmath19 is a positive supersolution of the linearized operator @xmath102 at @xmath19 in all @xmath77 ; see .",

    "assume that @xmath277    we apply lemma  [ mpsuper ] with the choice @xmath278 note that @xmath279 in @xmath178 , and thus @xmath280    for the set @xmath272 in lemma  [ mpsuper ] we choose @xmath281 and thus @xmath282 given a point @xmath283 , since @xmath255 is a point with the @xmath21 coordinate @xmath284 and with the @xmath20 coordinate @xmath285 , shows that in a neighborhood of @xmath255 the function @xmath144 is equal to a smooth function plus @xmath286 since @xmath287 , considering second order incremental quotients in the @xmath21 variable , we see that the liminf in for this function at the point @xmath255 is equal to @xmath288 .",

    "however , the statement of lemma  [ min ] suffices for our purposes here and , for completeness , we give next a simple proof of it .",
    "let @xmath297 an @xmath298 function locally in @xmath299 and positive in @xmath127 .    for @xmath154 , consider the problem @xmath300 by its definition , @xmath192 is a weak supersolution of , while @xmath301 is clearly a subsolution . as a consequence , there exists a weak solution @xmath302 of with @xmath303 .",

    "we obtain that the maximum principle holds for @xmath337 in @xmath127 .",

    "we start this section with some regularity issues needed in the subsequent . recall that we assume that @xmath342 for some @xmath12 .",

    "it argues by contradicting here by contradicting  and in this way obtaining a sequence of points @xmath374 , with @xmath375 , for which one of these asymptotics does not hold . by odd symmetry , and taking a subsequence",
    ", one may assume that @xmath376 .",
    "next , one translates the solution @xmath19 to be centered now at @xmath377 , and uses a translation and compactness argument ; compactness comes from a priori estimates and the arzela - ascoli theorem .",
    "the translated solutions converge to a solution @xmath211 in all of @xmath45 in the @xmath361 uniform convergence in compact sets , since any uniformly bounded sequence of solutions is uniformly bounded in @xmath361 on every compact set , as shown above .",
    "the points @xmath377 in the proof satisfy @xmath375 and now , in addition , @xmath378 since we are contradicting the @xmath379 convergence .",
    "now , in case  1 of the proof we have that the distances to the simons cone @xmath380 and thus the limiting solution @xmath211 is defined in all @xmath45 and satisfies @xmath381 . by stability of @xmath19 in @xmath77",
    "we deduce the stability of @xmath211 in @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath382 and therefore a liouville - type theorem of aronson and weinberger @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more general version , and @xcite for the statements ) guarantees that @xmath383 .",
    "thus @xmath384 , and since @xmath385 because @xmath386 , the proof arrives at a contradiction .",
    "finally , in case  2 of the proof , the points @xmath377 remain at a finite distance of the simons cone .",
    "since the curvatures of a cone tend to zero at infinity , in this case the limiting solution @xmath211 is nonnegative in a certain limiting half - space @xmath387 and @xmath211 vanishes at its boundary . by stability",
    "again , @xmath388 and hence @xmath389 in the half - space .",
    "then , a liouville theorem of angenent @xcite ( see also @xcite for the statement ) gives that @xmath211 is the 1d solution @xmath41 depending only on the euclidean variable orthogonal to the boundary of the half - space .",
    "since @xmath390 are the distances to the cone and remain bounded , in the limit this solution agrees with @xmath391 .",
    "hence , the full hessian @xmath392 tends to zero",
