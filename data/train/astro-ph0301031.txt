    "<S> gravitational lensing of the microwave background by the intervening dark matter mainly arises from large - angle fluctuations in the projected gravitational potential and hence offers a unique opportunity to study the physics of the dark sector at large scales . </S>",
    "<S> studies with surveys that cover greater than a percent of the sky will require techniques that incorporate the curvature of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> we lay the groundwork for these studies by deriving the full sky minimum variance quadratic estimators of the lensing potential from the cmb temperature and polarization fields . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a general technique for constructing these estimators , with harmonic space convolutions replaced by real space products , that is appropriate for both the full sky limit and the flat sky approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this also extends previous treatments to include estimators involving the temperature - polarization cross - correlation and should be useful for next generation experiments in which most of the additional information from polarization comes from this channel due to sensitivity limitations . </S>"
