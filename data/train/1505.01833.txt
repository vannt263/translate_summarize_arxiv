    "in quantitative entanglement theory , considerable effort has been spent in developing many different entanglement measures  @xcite , while much less is known regarding the relations between these measures and , in particular , their connection to the resources they quantify .",
    "this has lead to a situation that parts of quantitative entanglement theory have the fame of a certain arbitrariness , if not a lack of meaning .",
    "as opposed to this , we believe that  given a well - defined entanglement measure  there is a physical resource ( defined through a protocol ) that is quantified by this measure .    at present , there are only few well - established links between entanglement - related resources and their quantifiers  @xcite .",
    "however , many more mathematical ways of characterizing and quantifying entanglement are known than corresponding protocols using that entanglement .",
    "therefore we think it is important to investigate and reveal the relations between different concepts , their possible common origins and essential differences , in order to introduce more structure in the world of entanglement measures where it is possible .",
    "the subject of this article exemplifies the coexistence and apparent independence of different concepts in entanglement characterization .",
    "the partial - transpose criterion  @xcite provided the first possibility to detect entanglement in arbitrary mixed states .",
    "later , numerous tools based on the partial transpose were developed , such as decomposable entanglement witnesses  @xcite , negativity ( and logarithmic negativity ) as an entanglement measure  @xcite , combinations of the latter in detection of multipartite entanglement  @xcite , and others . on the other hand ,",
    "the concurrence was first introduced by bennett _",
    "_  @xcite as an auxiliary tool to compute the entanglement of formation for bell - diagonal two - qubit states and then developed further by wootters and co - workers  @xcite who established concurrence as an entanglement measure in its own right .",
    "subsequently , generalizations to the higher - dimensional case @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) as well as for multipartite systems ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) were proposed .",
    "there have been comparative studies of concurrence and negativity ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , however , as far as we can see they continue to exist in separate research lines .",
    "therefore , we find it useful to present a discussion showing that both negativity and concurrence can be directly related to the partial transpose , and that both essentially determine the same type of entanglement deriving from the schmidt rank of a bell state which results in various mathematical relations linking all these quantities .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the most important concepts and notation . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the links between partial transpose , concurrence , and negativity for pure states . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we extend this discussion to mixed states .",
    "in particular we study a family of symmetric bipartite mixed states  the axisymmetric states  for which the quantitative concepts of interest can be derived exactly thus providing both an illuminating illustration as well as a powerful tool for further investigation .",

    "the huge advantage of the negativity is that it can easily be computed for any mixed state , however , at the price that entanglement in states with a positive partial transpose ( ppt ) is not detected .    a related quantity which does detect ppt entanglement but , again , is hard to compute is the _ convex - roof extended negativity _",

    "the relation between pure - state concurrence and the partial transpose was studied before ( e.g. , @xcite ) but we find it important to make it very explicit here , because this will directly connect to the negativity and show what is actually quantified by these measures . moreover ,",
    "we discuss how concurrence and negativity can be viewed as @xmath41 norms of the concurrence vector .",
    "assume the pure state @xmath42 is a tensor product @xmath43 so that the corresponding projector can be written @xmath44 the matrix elements of the partial transpose of @xmath45 instead read @xmath46 therefore , for any product state @xmath42 we have @xmath47 a state that does not fulfill condition   can not be a product state . since violation of eq",

    "and we see that @xmath52 coincides with the @xmath0 concurrence @xmath53 .",
    "that is , _ for a pure state @xmath6 the squared concurrence is simply a measure for the total violation of the ppt - type condition  .",
    "_    because of the local unitary invariance of @xmath53 ( see sec .",

    "consider now the ( maximally entangled ) bell state of rank @xmath59 @xmath60 the corresponding concurrence equals @xmath61 we see that the concurrence grows monotonically with the schmidt rank of @xmath62 . for rank-@xmath59 states which are not maximally entangled",
    "the concurrence clearly is smaller than @xmath63 , in a sense it attributes an ` effective rank ' @xmath64 to the state .",
    "again , because of the local unitary invariance , we can compute the negativity @xmath39 from the schmidt decomposition @xmath65 @xmath66 in particular , we find for the bell states @xmath62 @xmath67 that is , in analogy with the concurrence the negativity ` counts ' the schmidt rank , if the state is maximally entangled . the word ` counting ' can be taken literally here due to the linear dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath59 ( cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "thus , we see that both concurrence and negativity quantify the schmidt rank , albeit in a mathematically different manner .",
    "if a state @xmath6 is not maximally entangled , both measures attribute a kind of ` effective rank ' to it which is smaller than that of the maximally entangled state locally equivalent to @xmath6 [ that is , equivalent under stochastic local operations and communication ( slocc ) ] .    from eqs .   and",
    "it is evident that the negativity gives equal weight to each schmidt rank increment while the concurrence favors increments at lower schmidt ranks .",
    "it is not difficult to track down the origin of this difference by comparing the squared equations and .",
    "the squared concurrence contains only the products of two different schmidt coefficients while the squared negativity has contributions also from products of up to four schmidt coefficients .",
    "moreover , the negativity keeps increasing linearly with the schmidt rank while the concurrence converges to a finite value .",
    "this means that adding more dimensions to a state which already has high schmidt rank does practically not augment the concurrence .",
    "this hints at the fact that concurrence and negativity , both being related to the schmidt rank of the state , quantify qualitatively different resources : the resource quantified by the concurrence is present to a high degree already in a state with relatively low schmidt rank , and can be improved beyond that only marginally . on the other hand",
    ", the negativity can grow without a limit on increasing the schmidt rank , and this should apply also to the corresponding resource .      from eq .   and also form the derivation of condition leading to the total violation of the ppt condition",
    ", we see that the concurrence formally looks like the length of a euclidean vector , i.e. , it can be regarded as the @xmath70 norm of the concurrence vector . however , in our derivation of condition it was by no means necessary to use the square of @xmath71 .",
    "the last line of eq .",
    "is correct also without squaring it .",
    "hence , we could have introduced a total violation of the ppt condition also as @xmath72 now , comparing eq .   with the negativity calculated from the schmidt decomposition , eq .",
    ", it is tempting to conclude that the pure - state negativity actually _ equals _ the @xmath73 norm of the concurrence vector  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath74 . unfortunately this is not correct in general .",
    "the reason is that the right - hand side in eq .   may increase under local unitaries , and thus can not represent an entanglement monotone .    to put it in different words : the negativity of a pure state @xmath6 equals the @xmath73 norm of the concurrence vector @xmath75 if @xmath6 is given in the schmidt basis .",
    "then , this @xmath73 norm assumes its _ minimum _ @xmath76 while for other local bases it is larger .",
    "clearly , since the _ minimum of the _ @xmath73 _ norm _ equals the negativity it is an entanglement monotone , however , the @xmath73 norm written in a different basis is not ( it is not even invariant under local unitaries ) .    now we will prove that @xmath77 is minimized for @xmath6 given in the schmidt basis , eq .  .",
    "to this end , consider local unitaries @xmath78 and @xmath79 applied to the parties of @xmath6 written in the schmidt basis @xmath80 and use this in eq .   to express @xmath81 as @xmath82 in order to proceed , we note that @xmath83 which is easily seen by expanding @xmath84 .",
    "this relation also implies local unitary invariance of the concurrence .    by substituting @xmath85 in eq .   and",
    "applying the triangle inequalities @xmath86 we obtain @xmath87 the last factor on the right - hand side is @xmath88 , by virtue of the cauchy - schwarz inequality and the normalization of columns of unitary matrices .",
    "hence we have @xmath89 where , as defined above , @xmath6 is a state given in the schmidt basis , while @xmath90 is obtained from @xmath6 by applying local unitaries .",
    "finally , it is easy to construct an example showing that indeed @xmath91 can increase under local unitaries , consider , e.g. , @xmath92 and apply a hadamard transform in the subspace @xmath93 .",
    "this concludes the proof .      by using the results of the previous section ,",
    "a number of interesting inequalities connecting concurrence , negativity and schmidt rank can be proven .",
    "we have already mentioned that for a pure state @xmath94 of schmidt rank @xmath59 @xmath95 furthermore , we see that @xmath96 the first of these inequalities can be readily deduced from eqs .   and while the second is a consequence of the fact that the quadratic is larger than the arithmetic mean .",
    "obviously , for pure states of two qubits the negativity equals the concurrence divided by two .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds ] , we illustrate the bounds of eq .   by plotting the concurrence and negativity for many randomly chosen pure states . clearly , those linear estimates are not the best ones possible .",
    "in fact , the evident ( curved ) boundaries for the concurrence values can be obtained by analytically maximizing / minimizing the concurrence for given negativity and rank of the state .     and @xmath97 .",
    "the green lines represent the upper and lower bounds in eq .  .",
    "the estimation of the schmidt number and the concurrence for arbitrary mixed states is an important problem , both for theory and experiment . by combining the results for pure states and some recent ideas",
    "@xcite one obtains an interesting toolbox for practical applications .",
    "the great advantage of the negativity is that it can be evaluated also for arbitrary mixed states , as opposed to the schmidt number or the concurrence .",
    "we will now discuss some relations connecting the negativity to the other two quantites .",
    "it has been shown only recently  @xcite that the negativity can actually be used as a lower bound on the schmidt number .",
    "let us assume that we are given a mixed state @xmath8 of a @xmath0 system and a decomposition @xmath98 that optimizes the schmidt number @xmath99 .",
    "then we have @xmath100 from which follows @xmath101 here we have used eq .   and the convexity of negativity .",
    "an analogous inequality can be derived for the concurrence @xmath102 from which we arrive at @xmath103 this relation is essentially different from eq .  .",
    "on the one hand , finding a useful lower bound for the concurrence might be more difficult than calculating the negativity . on the other hand , for ppt - entangled states eq .",
    "is not useful .",
    "we can also find inequalities for the concurrence and the negativity .",
    "from the first inequality in eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath104 while from the second inequality of eq .",

    ".  ] , and the negativity @xmath109 is a lower bound to the latter . therefore , the @xmath110 negativity never exceeds the concurrence divided by two , as noted in  ref .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for higher local dimension @xmath1 the negativity may be larger than half the concurrence ( e.g. , bell states ) , but it may also be smaller ( e.g. , ppt - entangled states ) .",
    "already from the discussion in the preceding section it can be seen that it is desirable to have systematic ways for estimating the mixed - state concurrence .",

    "while in those references the focus is on multipartite states , we apply it here in the simpler case of bipartite states .",

    "the negativity equals that @xmath73 norm if the pure state is written in the schmidt decomposition .",
    "these relations between negativity and concurrence lead to various estimates for those measures ( as well as for the schmidt number ) in mixed states .",
    "a particularly nice result is that the negativity represents a direct lower bound to the schmidt number of a state , eq .  .",
    "in the last section , we have provided an extensive discussion of the axisymmetric states , a nontrivial family of highly symmetric @xmath0 states for which all the entanglement properties studied in this article can be calculated exactly .",
