    "quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) molecular conductors exhibit a variety of phase transitions , where different kinds of symmetry - broken orderings in charge , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom are competing .",
    "such competitions occur even when their non - interacting band structures are similar , suggesting a crucial role of interactions , i.e. , electron - electron as well as electron - lattice interactions .",
    "typical examples are the families of ( dcnqi)@xmath0 and ( tmttf)@xmath0 , which have q1d quarter - filled @xmath1-bands in terms of electrons and holes , respectively  @xcite .",
    "they show different phase transitions depending on each material as well as applied pressure , such as charge ordering ( co ) , lattice dimerization , which drives the system effectively half - filled resulting in a dimer mott ( dm ) insulating state , and lattice tetramerization which is ascribed to a spin - peierls ( sp ) transition  @xcite .",
    "this diversity originates from an interplay between the strong coulomb interaction among electrons and the reduced dimensionality giving rise to lattice instabilities .",
    "theoretical aspects of such electron - lattice coupled phase transitions have been extensively studied based on 1d and q1d extended hubbard models with electron - lattice couplings at quarter - filling  @xcite .",
    "different states have been reproduced , at the ground state  @xcite as well as at finite temperatures  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ground state phase diagrams of 1d models were obtained , where two different kinds of sp states were found to be competing with each other .",
    "one is the coexisting state with co ( co+sp ) and the other is that with lattice dimerization , i.e. , dm ( dm+sp ) .",
    "the phase boundary between these two states is of first order . on the other hand ,",
    "the authors have recently investigated finite - temperature properties of a more general model including the inter - chain coulomb interaction , a lattice anharmonicity , and the intrinsic dimerization , and found that they play crucial roles in the critical behavior among different phases , and are relevant to the experimental systems  @xcite . in this paper , motivated by the results ,",
    "we investigate the effects of such additional contributions on the ground - state phase competitions and coexistences , and how the criticality among different sp states mentioned above are affected .",
    "we investigate the q1d quarter - filled model previously studied in refs .",
    "@xcite at finite temperatures , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the intra - chain part of the @xmath5-th chain and the inter - chain part , respectively .",
    "the former is given by the extended peierls - hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath6 where the notations are referred to ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we consider the uniaxial lattice distortions @xmath7 along the 1d chain and neglect their quantum fluctuations as in the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the term with @xmath8 represents an anharmonicity in the lattice distortion .",
    "the inter - chain part is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the inter - chain coulomb interaction and the summation for @xmath11 runs over nearest - neighbor chains .",
    "in the following calculations , we choose the on - site and nearest - neighbor coulomb interactions as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and the elastic constant as @xmath14 , in the energy unit of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "we derive an effective 1d model by the inter - chain mean - field approximation as in ref .",
    "the mean - field form of @xmath4 is taken as@xmath16where @xmath17 denotes the number of nearest - neighbor chains and the chain index @xmath5 is dropped hereafter .",
    "( [ eq : vperp ] ) is derived by assuming the relative phase between neighboring chains as drawn in fig .  1 .    ) where chain @xmath5 is coupled to chains @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "]    [ fig1 ] we treat @xmath20 adiabatically , then static lattice distortions are determined so as to minimize the ground - state energy under the constraint @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain the ground state of the effective 1d model @xmath22 by exact diagonalization using the lanczos technique , and determine @xmath23 and @xmath20 self - consistently .",
    "we investigate symmetry breaking with a four - sites period along the chain , taking into account all possibility of the co , dm , and their variants with further tetramerizations .",
    "the self - consistent equations then involves the charge densities @xmath24 and the lattice distortions @xmath25 for @xmath26 . in the following ,",
    "we show results for the system size of @xmath27 under the anti - periodic boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "the obtained self - consistent solutions are parameterized as ( see fig .  1 ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average density , @xmath30 represents the alternating charge disproportionation for the co state , and @xmath31 the lattice dimerization for the dm state , respectively .",
    "lattice tetramerizations described by @xmath32 and @xmath33 characterize the co+sp and the dm+sp states , respectively , while four - fold charge disproportionation concomitantly appears as @xmath34 and @xmath35 in each of these states .",
    "first , we show the results in the absence of intrinsic dimerization , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "2 shows the variation of the order parameters as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 the ground state is the dm+sp state , where \\{@xmath39 , @xmath33 , @xmath35 } are finite while @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    ", the co+sp state appears for @xmath41 where , vise versa , \\{@xmath30 , @xmath34 , @xmath32 } are finite and @xmath42 . in the narrow intermediate region , @xmath43 ,",
    "all of the six parameters become finite .",
    "this indicates that a further coexistence of the dm+sp and co+sp states is stabilized , which was not found in previous studies on the ground state properties for similar models  @xcite .",
    "the two phase transition points , along dm+sp @xmath44 the multiple coexistent state @xmath44 co+sp , are of second order .     for @xmath36 for the harmonic case with @xmath45.[fig2 ] ]    next , for the case of anharmonic lattice distortions with @xmath46 , the results are shown in fig .  3 . here",
    ", we find different critical behavior between the dm+sp and co+sp states ; they are bordered by a direct first order phase transition at @xmath47 .",
    "this is interesting in a sense that , at finite temperatures above the sp transition temperatures , our recent results show that the anharmonicity contributes to rather enlarge the coexistent region of the paramagnetic co and dm states  @xcite .     for @xmath36 for the anharmonic case with @xmath48.[fig3 ] ]    finally , the results in the presence of intrinsic dimerization @xmath49 are shown in fig .  4 ; here , @xmath31 is always finite due to the symmetry breaking from the outset in the model .",
    "for @xmath50 the ground state is in the sp(+idm ) phase with \\{@xmath33 , @xmath35 } being finite and @xmath40 . here",
    "idm refers to the intrinsic dimerization to distinguish with the spontaneous dimerization in the model with @xmath51 , although the actual pattern is the same as in the dm+sp state . as for @xmath52 ,",
    "all the six order parameters become finite ; there occurs a second order phase transition into the co+sp(+idm ) state  @xcite . as a result of the intrinsic dimerization leading to @xmath53 ,",
    "when the co+sp component arises the order parameters for the sp(+idm ) state always remains , then the charge - lattice pattern is the same as in the multiple coexistence in fig  [ fig2 ] .     with intrinsic dimerization @xmath54 for the harmonic case with @xmath45.[fig4 ] ]",
    "here we compare our results with those in the previous studies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the model with @xmath51 and @xmath55 was studied . there",
    ", a first order phase transition between the dm+sp and co+sp states was found , while the multiple coexistence was not .",
    "this may be ascribed to the difference between the models , i.e. , whether to include @xmath37 or not . on the other hand ,",
    "a model including holstein - type electron - lattice coupling was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also indicated the first order phase transition .",
    "the holstein coupling under the adiabatic approximation leads to a term with a similar but slightly different form compared with the inter - chain mean - field contribution considered in the present work .",
    "this may be the cause of the difference in the results .",
    "all these comparisons suggest that the inter - chain coulomb interaction as well as lattice anharmonicity affects the critical behavior in the electron - lattice coupled phase transitions .",
    "a comprehensive study including the system size extrapolation is left for future study .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the phase competition and coexistence between different spin - peierls phases observed in quasi - one - dimensional molecular conductors .",
    "we found different sequences of phase transitions at the ground state , which reflect the slight difference in the model .",
    "this suggests a subtle balance between charge - lattice coupled symmetry breakings arising from strong correlation and reduced dimensionality .",
