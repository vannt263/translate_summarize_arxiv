    "the statistical mechanics approach to fluid systems aims at being able to describe the thermodynamic and structural properties of the system from the knowledge of the interactions of the particles that constitute it.@xcite this is indeed a very hard task and it remains in the general case as an unsolved problem . on the other hand , for practical applications , having an analytical equation of state ( eos ) for a given fluid , even if only approximate but otherwise reasonably accurate , is very useful .",
    "such an eos may be derived either empirically or from statistical mechanics , and once more in the latter case only in very few instances this can be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , insights may be gained from the analysis of ( maybe highly simplified ) model systems that hopefully capture the main characteristics of the interparticle interactions . among such versatile models , involving only spherical pair interactions , one finds the hard - core multi - yukawa ( hcmy ) fluid whose interparticle potential will be specified below . in particular , the hard - core double - yukawa ( hcdy ) model has received for a long time , even rather recently , a lot of attention in the literature ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this model has been used in connection with real systems including simple neutral fluids @xcite , chain - like fluids @xcite , liquid metals @xcite , charge - stabilized colloids @xcite , dilute solutions of strong electrolytes , molten salts and polymer solutions @xcite , dusty plasmas @xcite , microemulsions @xcite , globular proteins @xcite , fullerenes @xcite and hydrogen @xcite .    one further asset of ( hcmy ) fluids is that the statistical mechanics derivation is feasible and different approximate eos for them are already available . in turn , some aspects of their structural properties and the phase behavior arising from such eos have been analyzed .",
    "already in the 1980 s konior and jedzredeck@xcite pointed out the likely important role of the hcdy fluid as a reference fluid in the application of the thermodynamic perturbation theory for real fluids .",
    "as the former authors also stressed , this could eventually materialize only if its properties become as well known as those of the hard - sphere ( hs ) fluid . with this in mind , in this paper we would like to go one step further .",
    "first we will derive yet another ( approximate ) analytical eos for the hcmy fluid by using the first order thermodynamic perturbation theory based on the inverse temperature expansion with the hs fluid as the reference fluid . with this eos , that has a relatively simple form",
    ", we will analyze for the hcdy fluid its performance with respect to simulation results in six representative cases and compute the liquid - vapor coexistence curve ( including the critical point ) in those cases where it occurs .",
    "finally , we will ` sweep ' a range of values around the ones of the representative six cases in the parameters space of hcdy fluids in order to characterize the link between the critical behavior and the form of the interparticle potential .",
    "given the fact that different sets of values for the parameters in the potential have been fitted for representing realistic potentials , this characterization may serve as a guide and hopefully give us a clue as to the actual critical behavior of real fluids .",

    "the fact that we have a closed - form analytical equation of state allows for the examination of the effect of the values of the potential parameters on the thermodynamic properties of the system . restricting ourselves to the hdcy fluid",
    "we have been able to compute isotherms , liquid - vapor coexistence curves and the critical constants ( these last two properties when they exist ) for the six systems that were previously considered by lin _ et al._@xcite both the computation of the critical points and the coexistence curves are to our knowledge completely new and call for confirmation from simulation .",
    "we hope that our results will stimulate the performance of such simulations .",
    "nevertheless , based on the information pertaining to the six cases , we performed an stochastic analysis of the potential parameters leading to a physical liquid - vapor critical point .",
    "it turns out that , within the present approximation , one may clearly identify regions in the parameters space where the corresponding potential will not produce a liquid - vapor phase transition .",
    "although this evidence can not be considered as wholly conclusive given the approximations involved , it may certainly serve as a guide for further simulations or for the application of the hcdy fluid to model a specific system .",
    "finally , we should mention that a similar development can be carried out for a multi - yukawa potential without a hard core .",
    "this only requires the use of an effective hard - core diameter for which specific recipes exist within the thermodynamic perturbation theory@xcite in which the hard - sphere fluid is taken as the reference system .",
    "while we have performed some calculations following this strategy , the simplicity of a totally analytical development is lost and the actual computations become much more involved .",
