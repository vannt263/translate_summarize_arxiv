    "after the discovery of standard model ( sm ) higgs - like boson , the next step is to measure its couplings precisely to see possible deviation from the sm and thus to search for new physics .",
    "the yukawa couplings between higgs boson and charged leptons that cause lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) are of particular interest , because in the sm they are absent at tree level and highly suppressed at loop levels , and thus are sensitive to new physics . as a matter of fact , in most of models that address neutrino masses and oscillations ,",
    "lfv is well expected and has already been observed in neutrino oscillations described by the pmns matrix . moreover , although charged lepton flavor violation ( clfv ) has not been observed yet , in general those models should leave measurable signals in processes like @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc .",
    "a lot of efforts have been devoted to searching for clfv and the null results impose very strong bounds on the magnitude of lfv  @xcite .    searching for lfv higgs decays",

    "is too small to be observed  @xcite .",
    "this is because of the decoupling of right - handed neutrinos ( rhns ) either through the smallness of yukawa couplings or heaviness of rhns . in the inverse seesaw mechanism , where sizable yukawa couplings are allowed for light rhns",
    ", appreciable lfv higgs decay can be accommodated  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the tiny neutrino masses can be generated by radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , none of those radiative seesaw models could generate large lfv higgs decay . actually , facing the stringent constraint from clfv , it is quite nontrivial to get lfv higgs decay large enough to detect at the lhc .    at tree level , two ( or even more)-higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with proper flavor changing neutral current allows lfv higgs decay which is large enough to explain the cms excess  @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional operators in the effective theory framework were also considered  @xcite .",

    "we establish a connection between lfv higgs decay and a type of dark matter ( dm ) , _ i.e. _ , lepton - flavored dm  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "dm interacts merely with the sm lepton sector , whereupon dm - quark interactions arise at loop level .",
    "an obvious merit of that kind of dm is that we can easily understand the null results from dm direct detection experiments such as lux  @xcite .",
    "that paradigm can be achieved in two ways .",
    "one way is introducing a leptophilic vector boson or higgs boson propagating in the @xmath14channel for the dm pair annihilation diagrams .",
    "this kind of model gives rise to poor flavor phenomenology .",
    "the other way is introducing mediators in the @xmath15channel to form lepton flavored dm  .",
    "then , lfv can happen in the dark sector and is mediated to the sm sector via loop processes .",
    "furthermore , mediators could consist of both left - handed and right - handed scalar leptons ( the previous studies were based on only one type of them ) , just as in the case of the supersymmetric sms .",
    "remarkably , we find that this kind of lepton - flavored dm is able to accommodate lfv higgs decay while other models with only one type chirality fail to . as an example",
    ", we will show that in our model a sizable br@xmath16 at the level of @xmath17 can be naturally achieved without incurring too large br(@xmath18 ) .",
    "it is attributed partly to the large chirality flipping in the scalar sector and also to the cancellation between different contributions to clfv .",
    "in addition , we study the mechanism for dm , a majorana fermion , to acquire correct relic density . for the weak scale dm ,",
    "even @xmath14wave annihilation may work without large yukawa couplings .",
    "related to radiative lfv higgs decay , radiative correction could also lead to higgs - mediated dm - nucleon scattering which may be detected in the near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] the model is introduced . in section  [ sec : lfv ] we consider higgs lfv decay confronting charged lepton lfv decay , along with others . in section  [ sec : dm ] we study relic density and direct detection of our leptophilic dark matter and their relations with lfv higgs decay .",

    "in this section we will first present the model in its simplest version , and then calculate the mass spectra that will be used later .       from model building perspective , a natural way to realize a lepton - flavored dm is to introduce a majorana dm candidate connected to some lepton flavors by means of scalar leptons . if dm is a scalar field ,",
    "whether it is real or complex , it is hard to get rid of the conventional higgs portal in a natural manner , not to mention other demerits .",

    "first , mass degeneracy between @xmath134 and @xmath35 is well consistent with the suppression of br@xmath213 , which is made small by the cancellation mechanism with @xmath214 . for a strong mass hierarchy case @xmath215 , from footnote 4 we have @xmath216 .",
    "second , by virtue of a large @xmath40term , the effective cross section of coannihilation is enhanced by the process @xmath217 with @xmath134 in the @xmath15channel : @xmath218 we have worked in the maximal mixing @xmath219 .",
    "so , once @xmath220 , the enhancing factor still scales as @xmath221 even for a tev scale @xmath137 .",
    "we have shown that dm can gain correct relic density readily . and",
    "dm mass should be around the weak scale so as to avoid large yukawa couplings . in this subsection",
    "we move to the second difference , direct detection . as a leptophilic dm ,",
    "dm - nucleon scattering is absent at tree level , but could be generated by radiative corrections .",
    "there are two types of corrections leading to dm - nucleon scattering , one mediated by photon and the other higgs boson , respectively . in particular , the second type , which is absent in the previous setup , benefits from @xmath40enhancement and can potentially overcome the loop suppression .",
    "the second type is the usual dimension - four operator which comes from the vertex correction on @xmath222 , absent at tree level but generated after ewsb . in the dm direct detection ,",
    "typically the transferring momentum @xmath223 is very small compared with the other mass scales in the charged particles in the loops , so that @xmath224 where @xmath225 is treated off - shell with invariant mass @xmath226 .",
    "the effective coupling at zero momentum transfer is expressed as @xmath227.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the kinematics and the approximations of two- and three - point scalar functions in appendix  [ approx ] , we can further simplify it into @xmath228,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath229 seen in eq .",
    "( [ g12 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath230 shows cancellation and thus larger @xmath231 dwells on the region with @xmath232 at least modularity larger than @xmath233 .",

    "@xcite ) and we then get the estimation @xmath244 , a value near the sensitivity of the current lux . in the bulk parameter space , @xmath245 : @xmath246 the decoupling scenario is hard to be probed , but the maximal mixing scenario , which badly needs a very large @xmath49 , has a good prospect .",
    "we choose a benchmark case which is directly related with @xmath58 .",
    "photon - mediated scattering becomes important for lighter mediators .",
    "since our dm is a majorana fermion , the leading order operator for dm - nucleon coupling is the dimension - six anapole operator  @xcite : @xmath247 the @xmath248 can be obtained by integrating out loopy particles step by step  @xcite or via direct calculation of the loops  @xcite : @xmath249 with @xmath250 .",
    "the expression is valid for the heavy leptons with @xmath251 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath248 is insensitive to the @xmath40term and the mixing angle . for @xmath252",
    "gev , it is estimated that @xmath253 .",
    "the resulting scattering rate is at least four orders of magnitude weaker than the current lux sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "in sm , lepton flavor is accidentally conserved but on the other hand lfv is an established fact .",
    "so it is of importance to search for lfv processes such as lfv higgs decay in the lhc era .",
    "it is a good probe to new physics .",
    "but lfv higgs decay is negligible and undetectable in most new physics models for addressing neutrino masses . in this paper",
    "we study a type of new physics that could lead to large higgs lfv decay , i.e. , lepton - flavored dark matter specified by the particle property of dm ( a majorana fermion ) and dm - sm mediators ( scalar leptons ) .",
    "different than other similar setups , here we introduce both the left - handed and the right - handed scalar leptons .",
    "they allow for large lfv in higgs decay and thus may explain the tentative br@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we find that the stringent bound from @xmath1 can be naturally avoided especially in the decoupling limit of slepton sector . aspects of relic density and radiative direct detection of the leptonic dm are also investigated .",
    "there are several open questions that deserve future investigation . first , as mentioned in the text ,",
    "neutrino masses and mixings can be radiatively generated because all the core of the ernest ma s model is already incorporated in our model .",
    "even restricted to one rhn , i.e. , the majorana dm , we are able to generate realistic neutrino mixings after introducing a couple of scalar lepton doublets @xmath254 .",
    "second , in this article we merely discuss lfv in the first and second family of leptons , and such kind of discussions are easily generalized to other families , which is of particular interest when correlated with neutrino phenomenologies .",
    "however , it is not easy to reconcile the tiny neutrino mass scale with a large lfv higgs decay like br@xmath0 , because the former basically requires somewhat smaller yukawa couplings @xmath255 .",
    "of course , if we work on very light dm like below the gev even mev scale , maybe there still stands a chance .",
    "we thank pyungwon ko very much for valuable discussions and reading the manuscript carefully . this work is supported in part by national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) research grant nrf-2015r1a2a1a05001869 ( sb ) .",
