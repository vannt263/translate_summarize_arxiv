    "the cr ion has a strong hund s rule coupling and lives in an octahedral crystal field .",

    "the resulting bulk state is a mott insulator in which all charge and orbital effects are quenched .",
    "the magnetic properties of a spinel oxide like cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 therefore depend by the way in which a set of @xmath5 spins behave on a pyrochlore lattice .",

    "magnetization plateaux are very common in frustrated magnets .",
    "they are known to occur , for example , in both the ising  @xcite and heisenberg  @xcite models on the triangular lattice .",
    "the conventional explanation for magnetization plateaux is that quantum and/or thermal fluctuations act to favour a collinear state in which all spins point either parallel or antiparallel to the applied magnetic field .",
    "this state may ( or may not ) exhibit long range magnetic order , but since the number of spins in the system is an integer , it must exhibit a magnetization which is a rational fraction of the full moment  @xmath52 in the case of the triangular lattice .",
    "this leads to plateaux which are weak ( being a fluctuation effect ) , and uncorrelated with lattice distortion .",
    "the essential features of the half  magnetization plateau seen in cr spinels are its extreme robustness and the large accompanying lattice distortion .",
    "any model which seeks to explain it should therefore include the coupling between spins and the lattice , as well as the interactions between spins . we therefore consider the extended heisenberg model @xmath53   - { \\bf h } \\sum_{i } { \\bf s}_i \\ ; , \\label{eqn : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is an elastic constant , and the bond variable @xmath55 measures the change in separation of two cr ions relative to the state with the lowest elastic energy  @xcite .",

    "the biquadratic term in equation  ( [ eqn : hb ] ) is of a form which favours coplanar or collinear spin configurations , and as such is known to mimic quantum and thermal fluctuations @xcite . a more general choice of spin",
    " lattice hamiltonian can lead to more complex interactions in the effective spin model .",
    "however these do not change the essential physics of the problem , and for our purposes it will generally be sufficient to enforce four  sublattice order by adding a ferromagnetic ( fm ) third  neighbour interaction @xmath60 @xmath61 to the effective spin model equation  [ eqn : hb ] ( see figure  [ fig : pyrochlore ] ) .",
    "the consequences of relaxing the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) will be discussed below .",
    "the phase diagram and magnetization process of the effective spin model equation  ( [ eqn : hb ] ) at @xmath62 are shown in figure  [ fig : theory2 ] and figure  [ fig : theory1 ] .",
    "the model exhibits four dominant phases :    * a 2:2 coplanar canted state with tetragonal symmetry for low field * a 3:1 collinear ( @xmath51 ) half  magnetization plateau state with trigonal symmetry for intermediate field * a 3:1 coplanar canted state with trigonal symmetry for fields approaching saturation * a saturated ( @xmath63 ) state with cubic symmetry for large magnetic field    these can be classified in terms of the two ",

    "interestingly , the ( negative ) sign of the magnetostriction seen in cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 implies that the strength of af exchange interactions @xmath7 _ increases _ rather than decreases with bond length , i.e. @xmath68 in equation  ( [ eqn : h ] ) .",

    "however the present theory is none the less very successful in explaining their magnetization process @xmath24 .",
    "this apparent piece of serendipity is in fact a profound consequence of the extreme frustration of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the theory presented above accurately describes the behaviour of individual tetrahedra in applied magnetic field .",
    "these tetrahedra may be assembled into arbitrarily complex magnetically ordered states without qualitative change in their thermodynamic properties ( e.g. magnetization ) .",
    "in fact it is even possible to relax the condition of long range magnetic order entirely , and obtain a spin liquid state which exhibits much the same magnetization process  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization plateau in cr spinels is a very recent discovery , and there is every reason to believe that much more can be learnt about cr spinels and other related systems .",
    "the mechanism proposed to explain the plateau  a coupling to lattice degrees of freedom  is very general and can be expected to function in many other frustrated magnets and magnetic molecules .",
    "many theoretical avenues also remain open , including the examination of quantum effects  @xcite , the ab initio calculation of spin and lattice interactions  @xcite , and the extension of symmetry analysis and monte carlo simulation to more realistic models  @xcite .",
    "half  magnetization plateaux are only one of the many interesting new consequences of frustration seen in spinel oxides .",
