    "qualitative understanding of phenomena come from very simple models that capture their essence . in atoms ,",
    "perhaps the most successful simple models are the famous thomas - fermi ( tf ) theory @xcite , and the large-@xmath10 expansion @xcite , leading , the latter , to a qualitative picture similar to the one devised by lewis long ago @xcite .",
    "the theory by thomas and fermi is a mean - field one in which the scaling properties of the kinetic energy and coulomb potentials are apparent .",
    "this fact leads to a universal relation for the energy of the atom with @xmath0 electrons and charge @xmath1 , @xcite @xmath11 , or for the ionization potential @xcite , @xmath12 , where the universal functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend only on the combination @xmath15 .    according to tf theory , for a fixed ratio @xmath15",
    ", the ionization potential ( or the electron affinity , @xmath16 ) should behave as @xmath17 , when @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is the correct dependence for cations ( @xmath18 ) , even for small @xmath0 values , as can be seen in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but it breaks down for neutral atoms ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 or @xmath16 , apart from fluctuations due to shell effects , take roughly a constant value ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the reason for such a breaking down of tf predictions for neutral atoms , in certain situations , is the proximity of the anionic instability threshold , that is , the fact that atoms become unstable when @xmath21 .    in our paper , we aim at studying the vicinity of the anionic threshold .",
    "we show that a simple physical picture holds at @xmath5 , which is close enough to @xmath7 , allowing us to accurately compute the slope of the energy curve . extrapolating this line",
    ", we obtain a quite good estimation of @xmath7 .",
    "the physics of neutral atoms , takes place in an intermediate regime between the tf - region ( @xmath22 ) , and the anionic instability region ( @xmath23 ) . extrapolating the linear dependence up to @xmath8 ,",
    "we get an estimation of the ionization potential of the atom with @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the fact that this estimation is qualitatively good , could be understood as an indication that , with regard to certain properties , neutral atoms are closer to the anionic instability region than they are to the cationic , thomas - fermi , regime .",

    ", the tangent line provides also a crude estimation of the ionization potential of the neutral atom with @xmath0 electrons , which nevertheless shows the correct dependence on @xmath0 , as it will be demonstrated below .",
    "as mentioned above , at @xmath33 the atom spontaneously ionizes by emitting an alectron . thus , near @xmath7 there should be an electronic orbit with a relatively high characteristic radius .",
    "if we think about the helium atom , for example , we may write the spatial wave function ( up to a normalization factor ) as :    @xmath34    where 1 and 2 refer to electron coordinates , @xmath35 is the @xmath36 orbital of the core electron , and @xmath37 - the @xmath36 orbital of the external electron",
    ".    the overlap function between external and core orbitals , @xmath38 , should be small . neglecting overlapping ,",
    "we may write an effective schrodinger equation for @xmath39 which , in the general case , reads :    @xmath40    @xmath41 takes account of the short - range interactions with the core electrons . it s effective radius , @xmath42 , should be similar to the radius of the @xmath6 electron atom .",

    "the later stament is equivalent to saying that @xmath37 remains normalized at threshold ( @xmath48 ) , thus , by the feynman - hellman theorem , the slope can be computed as @xmath49 .",

    "it is apparent that the qualitative dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath0 is reproduced by this simple expression , although deviations are noticeable .",
    "the fact that @xmath20 can be qualitatively reproduced from the linear dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath1 , coming from the anionic instability threshold , can be understood as an indication that , at least with regard to this property , the physical regime under which neutral atoms operate is closer to the instability threshold than to the large-@xmath1 regime , described by tf theory .",

    "it is exactly @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the principal quantum number of the last occupied shell . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath73 comes from the perturbative evaluation of coulomb repulsion between electrons :    @xmath76    where the sum runs over occupied orbitals , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the orbital left by the electron .",

    "we have shown that the properties of neutral atoms can not always be qualitatively understood in terms of the prescriptions of tf theory , which are , however , valid in the cationic domain , @xmath96 .",
    "the anionic domain , @xmath97 , is characterized by an instability threshold at @xmath98 , and a linear dependence of the atom binding energy on @xmath1 .",
    "the ionization potential of the neutral atom , for example , is mostly determined by this linear dependence .",
    "energy gaps in other sectors of the spectrum , atomic susceptibilities , some aspects of chemical binding , etc could be qualitatively related to the anionic regime also .",
    "we show that the slope of the energy curve can be computed at @xmath5 by a kind of zero - range forces theory .",
    "it is amazing that such a simple model provides quite accurate results for the slope in many atoms .",
    "from the slope and the electron affinity at @xmath5 , we estimate both @xmath7 and @xmath20 for a set of atoms . the estimations can be notably improved if we add information about the large-@xmath1 regime .",
    "indeed , we write a regularized perturbative series for the binding energy which reproduces not only @xmath20 , but the ionization potential of cations as well .",

    "support by the caribbean network for quantum mechanics , particles and fields ( ictp , trieste , italy ) is acknowledged .",
    "a very rough estimation of @xmath7 would consist of a linear interpolation up to @xmath32 from the points @xmath99 at @xmath8 , and @xmath84 at @xmath5 .",
    "notice that the coulomb component of @xmath103 has the correct behavior at @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the short - range component , on the other hand , is controlled by the parameter @xmath106 .",
    "if we require that @xmath99 at @xmath8 , we get a value @xmath107 for @xmath106 . in the same way , by requiring that @xmath84 at @xmath5 , we get a value @xmath108 . for @xmath109 , kais and co - workers use a linear interpolation :      the use of an effective schrodinger equation for the external orbital is justified at @xmath111 , but controversial at @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , by using this scheme , the authors reproduce configuration interacion calculations by hogreve @xcite for light atoms , @xmath112 .",
    "still more controversial , in certain cases , is the definition of the external orbital in the interval @xmath113 .",
