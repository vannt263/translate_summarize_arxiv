    "it is well known that a classical vortex filament can support linear waves .",
    "these were predicted by kelvin more than one century ago and experimentally observed about 50 years ago in superfluid @xmath1 . at very low temperature , where the friction induced by normal fluid component can be neglected ,",
    "kelvin waves can be dissipated only at very high frequencies by phonon emission @xcite .",
    "therefore at lower frequency , energy is transferred among different wavenumbers by nonlinear coupling .",
    "this is the mechanism at the basis of the kelvin wave cascade which sustains superfluid turbulence @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the single vortex kelvin wave cascade has attracted much theoretical @xcite , numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite attention . even within the classical one - dimensional vortex model ,",
    "different degrees of simplification are possible . for small amplitudes ,",
    "the vortex configuration can be described by a two component vector field , made of the coordinates of the vortex line in the plane transverse to the direction of the unperturbed filament .",
    "these depend on the single coordinate that runs along the filament .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , this system of equations admits a hamiltonian formulation , dubbed the two - dimensional biot - savart formulation ( 2d - bs ) , see ( 2 ) below .",
    "another , more drastic , simplification is obtained by considering local interactions only .",
    "this leads to the local induction approximation ( lia ) which was originally derived starting from the full 3d - bs @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of lia is that it generates an integrable system with infinite conserved quantities , as it is equivalent to the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , and therefore , the resonant wave interactions are absent ( at all orders ) and one can not reproduce the phenomenology of the full system .",
    "for this reason lia , despite its simplicity , is of little help for the study of _ weak _ kelvin wave turbulence . on the other hand , lia contains solutions leading to self - crossings ( numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite ) and , therefore , it can qualitatively describe vortex line reconnections in _",
    "strong _ 3d - bs turbulence (  vortex tangle \" ) .",
    "in this paper we consider simple models for a vortex filament that is able to sustain a turbulent energy cascade .",
    "the first model is obtained in the limit of small amplitudes by a taylor expansion of the 2d - lia .",
    "the truncation breaks the integrability of the hamiltonian and therefore generates a dynamical system with two inviscid invariants ( energy and wave action ) . for this class of systems ,",
    "whose prototype is the two - dimensional navier - stokes turbulence @xcite , we expect a dual cascade phenomenology in which one quantity flows to small scales generating a _ direct cascade _ while the other goes to larger scales producing an _ inverse cascade_. the possibility of a dual cascade scenario for kelvin waves turbulence has been recently suggested @xcite but never observed , and in this paper we present the first numerical evidence for the inverse cascade .",
    "the second class of simplified models , differential approximation models ( dams ) , use a closure in which the multi - dimensional @xmath0-space integral in the wave interaction term ( collision integral in the wave kinetic equation ) is replaced by a nonlinear differential term that preserve the main properties and scalings of the kelvin wave dynamics such as the energy and wave action conservations , scaling of the characteristic evolution time with respect to the wave intensity and the wavenumber @xmath0 .",
    "dams have proved to be a very useful tool in the analysis of fluid dynamical and wave turbulence in the past @xcite , and here we study them in the context of the kelvin wave turbulence .",
    "dams are particularly useful when one would like to understand the temporal evolution of the spectrum , when the physical forcing and dissipation need to be included , or when the kelvin wave system is subject to more involved boundary conditions leading to simultaneous presence of two cascades in the same range of scales , or a thermalization ( bottleneck ) spectrum accumulation near a flux - reflecting boundary . in the second part of this paper",
    ", we will present numerical studies of dams in presence of some of these physical factors and we will test some previously obtained analytical predictions .",
    "at a macroscopic level , the superfluid vortex filament is a classical object whose dynamics is often described by the biot - savart equation ( bse ) @xmath2 which describes the self - interaction of vortex elements .",
    "the quantum nature of the phenomenon is encoded in the discreteness of circulation @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the bse dynamics of the vortex filament admits a hamiltonian formulation under a simple geometrical constraint : the position @xmath4 of the vortex is represented in a two - dimensional parametric form as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a given axis . from a geometrical point of view , this corresponds to small perturbations with respect to the straight line configuration , i.e. the vortex can not form folds in order to preserve the single - valuedness of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 functions . in terms of the complex canonical coordinate @xmath9 , the bse can be written in a hamiltonian form @xmath10/\\delta w^*$ ] with @xcite @xmath11 = { \\kappa \\over 4 \\pi } \\int dz_1 dz_2 { 1 + re(w'^{*}(z_1 ) w'(z_2 ) ) \\over \\sqrt{(z_1 - z_2)^2 + |w(z_1)-w(z_2)|^2 } } , \\label{eq : h2d}\\ ] ] where we have used the notation @xmath12 .",
    "the geometrical constraint of a small amplitude perturbation can be expressed in terms of a parameter @xmath13 .    an enormous simplification , both for theoretical and numerical purposes ,",
    "is obtained by means of the so called local induction approximation ( lia ) @xcite .",
    "this approximation is justified by the observation that ( [ eq : bse ] ) is divergent as @xmath14 and is obtained by introducing a cutoff at @xmath15 in the integral in ( [ eq : bse ] ) which represents the vortex filament radius . when applied to hamiltonian ( [ eq : h2d ] )",

    "here , it was taken into account that because @xmath18 is much smaller than any other characteristic size in the system , @xmath19 will be about the same whatever characteristic scale @xmath16 we take in its definition .",
    "we remark that in the lia approximation the hamiltonian is proportional to the vortex length @xmath20=\\int dz \\sqrt{1 + |w'(z)|^2}$ ] which is therefore a conserved quantity .",
    "the equation of motion from ( [ eq : hlia ] ) is ( we set @xmath21 without loss of generality , i.e. we rescale time as @xmath22 ) @xmath23 as a consequence of the invariance under phase transformations , equation ( [ eq : lia ] ) also conserves the total wave action ( also called the kelvon number @xcite ) @xmath24 = \\int dz |w|^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : n}\\ ] ]    in addition to these two conserved quantities , the 2d - lia model possesses an infinite set of invariants and is integrable , as it is the lia of bse ( which can be transformed into the nonlinear schrdinger equation by the hasimoto transformation , see appendix b ) . due to the integrability , in weak kelvin wave turbulence",
    "the energy and the wave action can not cascade within the lia model , but this can be fixed by a simple truncation as we show in the next section .",
    "integrability is broken if one considers a truncated expansion of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hlia ] ) in power of wave amplitude @xmath25 . taking into account the lower order terms",
    "only , one obtains : @xmath26 & = & h_0 + h_1 + h_2 =   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int dz \\left ( 1 + { 1 \\over 2 } |w'|^2 - { 1 \\over 8 } |w'|^4 \\right ) .",

    "the near - identity transformation allows one to eliminate ",
    "unnecessary \" lower orders of nonlinearity in the system if the corresponding order of the wave interaction process is nil @xcite .",
    "for example , if there are no three - wave resonances , then one can eliminate the cubic hamiltonian .",
    "( the quadratic hamiltonian corresponding to the linear dynamics , of course , stays ) .",
    "this process can be repeated recursively , in a way similar to the kam theory , until the lowest order of the non - trivial resonances is reached .",
    "if no such resonances appear in any order , one has an integrable system .    in our case",
    ", there are no four - wave resonances ( there are no non - trivial solution for the resonance conditions for @xmath32 if @xmath33 in one dimension ) . however , there are nontrivial solutions of the six - wave resonant conditions .",
    "thus , one can use the near - identity transformation to convert system ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) into the one with the lowest order nonlinear interaction to be of degree six , ( there are no five - wave resonances , the interaction coefficients in the quintic hamiltonian are identically equal to zero after applying the canonical transformation . )    a trick for finding a shortcut derivation of such a transformation is described in @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that the time evolution operator is a canonical transformation .",
    "taking the taylor expansion of @xmath34 around @xmath35 we get a desired transformation , that is by its derivation , canonical . the coefficients of each term can be calculated from an auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath36 ,    @xmath37    the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath36 represents a generic hamiltonian for the canonical variable @xmath38 , thus , defining @xmath38 in the canonical transformation will set the interaction coefficients of @xmath36 . here",
    "all interaction coefficients , ( terms denoted with tildes ) present in the auxiliary hamiltonian are arbitrary",
    ". a similar procedure was done in appendix a@xmath39 of @xcite to eliminate the cubic hamiltonian in cases when the three - wave interaction is nil , and here we apply a similar approach to eliminate the quadric hamiltonian .",
    "the transformation is represented as @xmath40 the transformation is canonical for all @xmath41 , so for simplicity we set @xmath42 .",
    "the coefficients of ( [ eq : trans ] ) can be calculated from the following formulae ,    @xmath43    due to the original hamiltonian ( [ eq : expansion ] ) @xmath44 having @xmath45 gauge symmetry , we have no cubic order hamiltonian terms , this greatly simplifies the canonical transformation ( [ eq : trans ] ) , because the absence of any non - zero three - wave interaction coefficients in @xmath44 automatically fixes the arbitrary cubic ( and quintic ) interaction coefficients within the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath36 to zero .",
    "thus , transformation ( [ eq : trans ] ) reduces to    @xmath46    to eliminate the nonresonant four - wave interactions in hamiltonian ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) , we substitute transformation ( [ eq : trans2 ] ) into hamiltonian ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) .",
    "this yields a new representation of hamiltonian ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) in variable @xmath38 , where the nonresonant terms ( more specifically the four - wave interaction terms ) will involve both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "arbitrariness of @xmath48 enables us to select this to eliminate the total four - wave interaction term , @xmath49 . in our case",
    "this selection is , @xmath50 this choice is valid as the denominator will not vanish due to the nonresonance of four - wave interactions .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) expressed in variable @xmath38 , @xmath51 becomes    @xmath52    @xmath53 is the arbitrary six - wave interaction coefficient arising from the auxiliary hamiltonian .",
    "this term does not contribute to the six - wave resonant dynamics as the factor in front will vanish upon the resonant manifold , that appears in the kinetic equation .",
    "@xmath54 is the six - wave interaction coefficient resulting from the canonical transformation which is defined later in equation ( [ eq : c123456 ] ) .    to deal with the arbitrary interaction coefficient @xmath53",
    ", one can decompose @xmath54 into its value taken on the six - wave resonant manifold plus the residue ( i.e. @xmath55 ) .",
    "we can then choose @xmath56 , hence , allowing the arbitrary six - wave interaction coefficient in @xmath36 to directly cancel with the residual value of @xmath54 .",
    "this enables us to write hamiltonian @xmath51 as    @xmath57    the explicit form of the interaction coefficient @xmath54 can be expressed by    @xmath58    zakharov and schulman discovered a parametrisation @xcite for the six - wave resonant condition with @xmath59 , @xmath60\\nonumber,\\\\ k_2&=&p+r\\left[u+\\frac{1}{u}+\\frac{1}{v}-3v\\right]\\nonumber,\\\\ k_3&=&p -\\frac{2r}{u}-2ru,\\\\ k_4&=&p + \\frac{2r}{u}-2ru\\nonumber,\\\\ k_5&=&p+r\\left[u-\\frac{1}{u}+\\frac{1}{v}+3v\\right]\\nonumber,\\\\ k_6&=&p+r\\left[u-\\frac{1}{u}-\\frac{1}{v}-3v\\right]\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this parametrisation allows us to explicitly calculate @xmath54 upon the resonant manifold .",
    "this is important because the wave kinetics take place on this manifold , that corresponds to the delta functions of wavenumbers @xmath0 and frequencies @xmath61 within the kinetic equation .",
    "when this parametrisation is used with equation ( [ eq : c123456 ] ) and @xmath62 we find that the resonant six - wave interaction coefficient simplifies to @xmath63 .",
    "note , that this is indeed the identical to the next term , @xmath64 in the lia expansion with opposite sign .",
    "this six - order interaction coefficient is obtained from coupling of two fourth - order vertices of @xmath49 .",
    "it is not surprising that the resulting expression coincides , with the opposite sign , with the interaction coefficient of @xmath64 in ( [ eq : hlia ] ) . indeed , ( [ eq : hlia ] ) is an integrable model which implies that if we retained the next order too , i.e. @xmath64 , then the resulting six - wave process would be nil , and the leading order would be an eight - wave process in this case .",
    "in fact , in the coordinate space the hamiltonian is simply @xmath26 & = & h_0   + h_3 =   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int dz \\left ( { 1 \\over 2 } |w'|^2 - { 1 \\over 16 } |w'|^6 \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : expansion - tr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the existence of the six - wave process is a consequence of the truncation ( [ eq : expansion ] ) of the hamiltonian .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ eq : expfourier ] ) ( or equivalently ( [ eq : hc ] ) or ( [ eq : expansion - tr ] ) ) constitutes the truncated - lia model for kelvin wave turbulence .",
    "it possesses the same scaling properties as the bse system : it conserves the energy and the wave action , and gives rise to a dual - cascade six - wave system with an interaction coefficient with the same order of homogeneity as the one of the bse .",

    "the agreement with the analytical prediction ( [ e - flux ] ) is good in a long range up to very high frequencies , where the phonon dissipation suddenly kicks in .",
    "such a sudden onset of dissipation is due to the abrupt growth of the phonon radiation term as a function of the frequency .",
    "the wave action spectra are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we see a good agreement with the analytical solution ( [ sol ] ) where @xmath144 is taken to be zero ( flux of wave action @xmath144 could only be generated by an extra forcing at the high - frequency end , which is absent in our case ) .",
    "we observe only a slightly steeper spectrum of @xmath151 compared with the analytical prediction of the direct energy cascade @xmath152 .",
    "this agreement is remarkable because the solution ( [ daminv ] ) is strictly valid only for the reduced and not the complete dam .",
    "this shows that the reduced dam does pretty well in predicting the behaviour of the more complete nonlinear model .",
    "naturally , in the case with the phonon dissipation , we see a deviation from the analytical solution at very small scales ( a rather sharp cut - off ) .",
    "( top ) and the spectrum ( bottom ) , compared with the analytical predictions ( [ e - flux ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) respectively . in each picture the results of the simulations with and without phonon dissipation are shown ( the phonon dissipation can be seen as an abrupt cutoff of the flux and the spectrum ) .",
    "the spectrum is very close to the prediction of the reduced model ( [ daminv ] ) : @xmath153 compared with @xmath154 which is expected in the inertial range ( @xmath155 ) . ]    in figure  [ fig4 ] we show the effect of switching on the friction term ( @xmath156 ) for the complete dam ( again , results for the reduced dam are very similar and are not shown ) . we see that the presence of the friction has the effect of reducing the energy flux in a large region from frequencies of around @xmath157 upwards .",
    "although the flux is reduced , we see that the spectrum has only a slight deviation from the predicted slope ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "finally we consider another dam model , ( [ damwarm ] ) , which contains only the direct and the thermodynamical bottleneck ( or warm cascade ) of energy .",
    "we force the system as usual , however , the simulation is composed of two phases : the first is to get a direct cascade steady state , then lowering the viscosity @xmath102 ( i.e. dissipation at small scales ) and then turning on the reflecting energy flux boundary condition at the smallest scale @xmath158 , after which the system evolves to a secondary steady state ( [ bottle1 ] ) . in figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we see a clear transition from the kz solution towards the thermalized spectrum .",
    "the bottom panel is a zoomed in section of the crossover using a compensated spectrum , so that one can clearly make the distinction between the two power laws .",
    "we see a good agreement with the predicted power law behaviour of the kz solution and of the thermalized solution .     and @xmath159 or @xmath150 .",
    "the energy flux is reduced at high @xmath129 s , but the spectrum slope remains as in the non - dissipative case for a longer frequency range . ]     w.r.t .",

    "@xmath129 ) which points out the transition from the @xmath160 behaviour to the @xmath161 one . in the picture",
    "below , we show a zoom of the region where the bottleneck effect appears in a sort of compensated spectrum , @xmath162 on the y - axis and @xmath129 on the x - axis . ]",
    "in summary , we have introduced and studied various reduced models for kelvin wave turbulence .",
    "firstly , we introduced a truncated - lia model for kelvin wave turbulence , which we have shown to exhibit the same scalings and dynamical features present in the conventional bse .",
    "we have used this model for numerical simulations of the direct and the inverse cascades and found spectra which are in very good agreement with the predictions of the wt theory .",
    "secondly , we discussed differential approximation models , and introduced three such models to describe various settings of kelvin wave turbulence , such as the direct energy cascade generated by vortex reconnections and dissipated via phonon radiation or / and the mutual friction with the normal liquid , as well as the bottleneck effect when the energy flux is reflected from the smallest scale .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of these cases , which showed good agreements with the predicted analytical solutions .",
    "in this appendix we review and extend the work of kozik and svistunov on the kelvin wave cascade ( ks@xmath163 ) @xcite .",
    "they considered the full biot - savart hamiltonian ( [ eq : h2d ] ) in @xmath164d , and simplified the denominator by taylor expansion .",
