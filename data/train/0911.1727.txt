    "the filamentation instability ( fi ) driven by counterpropagating electron beams amplifies magnetic fields in astrophysical and solar flare plasmas [ 1 - 5 ] and it is also relevant for inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite and laser - plasma interactions in general @xcite .",
    "it has been modelled with particle - in - cell ( pic ) and vlasov codes [ 9 - 17 ] taking sometimes into account the ion response and a guiding magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that the fi is important , when the beam speeds are at least mildly relativistic and if the beams have a similar density @xcite .",

    "more recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that the electric fields are also important in this context .",
    "an electric field component along the beam velocity vector @xmath0 is driven by the fi through the displacement current .",
    "this component is typically weak and its relevance to the plasma dynamics is negligible compared to that of the magnetic and the electrostatic fields .",
    "the fi is partially electrostatic during its linear growth phase , if the electron beams are asymmetric due to different densities .",
    "symmetric electron beams result in purely electromagnetic waves with wavevectors @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear growth mechanism is provided in this case by the current of the electrons , which have been accelerated by the magnetic pressure gradient force ( mpgf ) .",
    "the electromagnetic and electrostatic components separate in a 1d simulation box , because the gradients along two directions vanish in the maxwell s equations .",
    "the electrostatic field is polarized in the simulation direction , while the electromagnetic components are polarized orthogonal to it .",
    "if both electron beams have an equal density and temperature , the electrostatic field component along the wavevector @xmath2 can only be driven nonlinearly .",
    "we select here a direction of our 1d pic simulation box that is orthogonal to @xmath0 , through which this nonlinear mechanism can be examined in an isolated form .",

    "the large box sizes allow the growth of more than one wave and the filamentation modes compete .",
    "the electrostatic field oscillations are damped or inhibited and the amplitude modulus converges to one , which equals that expected from the mpgf .",

    ".    the electrostatic field during the intermittent phase has differed in our two simulations from that observed in ref .",
    "the movies demonstrated that this phase involves the formation of large nonlinear structures ( phase space holes ) in the electron distribution , which can result in steep gradients of the thermal pressure and in the generation of solitary ( bipolar ) electrostatic wave structures that are independent of the fields produced by the fi .",
    "the thermal pressure gradient force is comparable to that of the other nonlinear terms , but only over limited spatial intervals .",
    "the electric field component along the beam velocity vector has undergone a mode conversion .",
    "its energy leaked into the high - frequency electromagnetic modes @xcite .",
    "the wavenumber spectrum of the electrostatic field correlated well with that of the mpgf in simulation 1 , but the peak electric field overshot the expected one .",
    "the electrostatic field performed damped oscillations around @xmath80 and both converged eventually to the same value .",
    "the wavenumber spectrum of the electrostatic field in simulation 2 deviated from that of the mpgf in the intermittent phase .",
    "its wavenumber spectrum was broadband , while that of the mpgf was quasi - monochromatic .",
    "the amplitude modulus of the electrostatic field at the wavenumber , which corresponds to the dominant fourier component of the mpgf , jumped to the value expected from the mpgf .",
    "it did not overshoot and it was non - oscillatory .",
    "both simulations here have evidenced that the magnetic field driven by the fi organized itself such , that we obtained one oscillation in the simulation box after the intermittent phase .",
    "this is remarkable , because the exponential growth rate of the fundamental wavenumber is below that of its first harmonic .",
    "long waves excert a lower mpgf for a given amplitude and the dominance of the fundamental wavenumber may thus result from the lower nonlinear damping of this mode compared to that of its harmonics . the mode with the fundamental wavenumber considered in ref .",
    "@xcite has a higher growth rate than its harmonics and the absent mode competition may have facilitated the undamped oscillations around the equilibrium .",
    "however , the amplitude of the electrostatic field in the two simulations discussed here eventually converged to that expected from the mpgf and @xmath80 is thus a robust estimate for the electrostatic field driven by the mpgf for the considered case .",
    "this robustness explains , why a connection between the electrostatic field and the mpgf has been observed in a 2d pic simulation @xcite , where no equilibrium can be reached due to the filament mergers .",
    "this estimate does , however , not apply if positrons are present .",
    "their current reduces that of the electrons . if equal amounts of electrons and positrons are present , the electrostatic field driven by the mpgf is suppressed alltogether @xcite .",
    "mobile protons will react in particular to the stationary electric field @xcite and they will modify through their charge modulation the balance between the electrostatic field and the mpgf .",
    "highly relativistic beam velocities will probably also modify the balance between the mpgf and the electron currents it drives .",
