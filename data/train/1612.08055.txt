    "the field of nanoplasmonics@xcite is rapidly expanding to various research fields including materials science and chemistry due to tremendous capabilities offered by modern nanofabrication techniques.@xcite outstanding control is achieved in patterning metal surfaces.@xcite such a control provides a wider accessibility to evanescent electromagnetic modes to manipulate individual atoms and molecules.@xcite being able to couple molecules to cavity modes in the strong coupling regime , i.e. when the coupling strength surpasses all damping rates , is appealing due to various applications in molecular and material science by changing and allowing one to control the optical properties of the emitters or absorbers .",
    "recently , the strong optical coupling of plasmonic and excitonic systems has been achieved for different plasmonic structures , involving both localized  @xcite and propagating  @xcite surface plasmon - polaritons .",
    "hybrid exciton - plasmon modes formed due to strong coupling between molecules and plasmons have been observed as upper and lower polariton branches.@xcite the separation between the branches at zero - detuning referred to as a rabi splitting determines how strong two subsystems are coupled and how quickly the energy is transferred between them .",
    "the research in exciton - plasmon systems has its origins in the physics of semiconductor microcavities , where a typical rabi splitting can easily achieve tens of mev.@xcite plasmon - sustaining nanomaterials offer significantly smaller volume of a resonant mode ( in this case surface plasmon - polaritons ) and thus higher local fields and in turn greater rabi splittings well surpassing @xmath0 mev mark.@xcite    in this paper , we examine the light - matter interaction in the strong coupling limit by combining the bragg - plasmon ( bp ) mode of a hybrid organo - metallic colloidal array with excitonic j - aggregates dispersed on top of the grating . in order to control and maximize the rabi splitting energy , the spatial and spectral confinements of the electric field in immediate proximity of the curved metallic surface match",

    "furthermore , the concentration of the j - aggregates is varied such as to control the transition dipole strength of the excitonic system .",
    "we determine the dispersion relations of our systems for the various concentrations by varying the incident wavevector ( angular tuning ) in reflection experiments . very interestingly ,",
    "as the excitonic system reaches a characteristic concentration , we observe the transition from a traditional strong coupling regime with two polaritonic branches to a new regime of high molecular concentrations , where a third branch , nearly dispersionless , appears in the reflection spectra , starting from a characteristic incident angle .    to explain the unusual experimental results we perform rigorous numerical simulations of the exciton - plasmon opal arrays .",
    "we also propose and test a simple analytical model that explains the physical origin of the third mode and links its appearance in reflection and transmission spectra to a collective resonance due to strong molecule - molecule interactions .",
    "we also apply the proposed theoretical model to other hybrid systems finding that the observed phenomenon is general and should be observed in other systems thus confirming and expanding the earlier theoretical results.@xcite",
    "two - dimensional plasmonic opals were manufactured by nano - sphere lithography . briefly , hexagonal close packed mono - layers of polystyrene ( ps ) micro - spheres ( polysciences , diameters @xmath1 nm , 2.5% solids ( w / v ) aqueous suspensions ) were deposited on uv / ozone - cleaned ( 30 min ) 5 mm thick glass plates with a size of @xmath2 @xmath3 at a tilt angle of approximately 10@xmath4 .",

    "finally , the organic excitonic system ( tdbc cyanine dyes known to form j - aggregates with a large transition dipole moment ) was formed by spin - coating a highly - concentrated solution of the dye molecules dissolved ( @xmath7 mg / ml , @xmath8 mg / ml ) in a @xmath9 water : ethanol mixture , further bathed for @xmath10 min in a @xmath10% pdac solution , onto the silver corrugated surface .    the good quality and periodicity of these 2d plasmonic opals were ascertained optically by direct visualization of their visible iridescence ( figure  [ fig : material]b ) , as well as by their transmission ( t ) and reflection ( r ) spectra recorded at normal incidence through a 10x objective ( zeiss ultrafluar 10x/0.2 ) on a micro - spectrophotometer ( 20/20 v craic technologies ) .",

    "the optical transmission of a metal coated colloidal monolayer measured at normal incidence is known to exhibit a transmission maximum.@xcite this maximum is due to the coupling of the incident light to a surface plasmon - polariton mode via bragg scattering on the 2d lattice .",

    "the rabi splitting energy @xmath41 has been estimated at @xmath42 mev .    very interestingly , while increasing the j - aggregates concentration , we clearly observed , in a reproducible way , a significantly different trend with respect to the one reported above , for which the observed rabi splitting exhibits a red shift of the lower polaritonic branch and a blue shift of the higher polaritonic branch ( fig .",

    "<S> achieving and controlling strong light - matter interactions in many - body systems is of paramount importance both for fundamental understanding and potential applications . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate both experimentally and theoretically how to manipulate strong coupling between the bragg - plasmon mode supported by a organo - metallic array and molecular excitons in the form of j - aggregates dispersed on the hybrid structure . </S>",
    "<S> we observe experimentally the transition from a conventional strong coupling regime exhibiting the usual upper and lower polaritonic branches to a more complex regime , where a third nondispersive mode is seen , as the concentration of j - aggregates is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulations confirm the presence of the third resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute its physical nature to collective molecule - molecule interactions leading to the collective electromagnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> a simple analytical model is proposed to explain the physics of the third mode . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dependence on molecular parameters followed from the model are confirmed in a set of rigorous numerical studies . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that at the energy of the collective mode molecules oscillate completely out of phase with the incident radiation acting as an effective thin metal layer . </S>"
