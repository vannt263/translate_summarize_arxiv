    "the classical description of many  body quantum systems , and the classical simulation of their dynamics , is generically a hard problem , due to the exponential size of the associated hilbert space @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , under certain conditions an efficient description of states and/or their evolution is possible .",
    "this is , for instance , demonstrated by the density matrix renormalization group method @xcite , which allows one to successfully calculate ground states of strongly correlated spin systems in one spatial dimension using matrix product states @xcite . in this context , the questions _ for which ( families of ) states does an efficient classical description exist? _ , and _",
    "when is an efficient classical simulation of the evolution of such states under a given dynamics possible? _ are naturally of central importance .",
    "apart from their practical importance , the above questions are directly related to more fundamental issues , in particular to the power of quantum computation and the identification of the essential properties that give quantum computers their additional power over classical devices ; this relation to quantum computation will be central in this article .",
    "in particular , we will study these questions from the point of view of the _ measurement based _ approach to quantum computing , more specifically the model of the one  way quantum computer @xcite . in this model , a highly entangled multi ",
    "qubit state , the 2d _ cluster state _ @xcite , is processed by performing sequences of adaptive single  qubit measurements , thereby realizing arbitrary quantum computations .",
    "the 2d cluster state serves as a _",
    "universal resource _ for measurement based quantum computation ( mqc ) , in the sense that any multi  qubit state can be prepared by performing sequences of local operations on a sufficiently large 2d cluster state .",
    "when studying the fundamentals of the one  way model , two ( related ) questions naturally arise , which we will consider in the following ; first , it is asked which resource states , other than the 2d cluster states , form universal resources for mqc ; second , one may also consider the question whether mqc on a given state can be _ efficiently simulated _ on a classical computer . naturally , these two issues are closely related , as one expects that an efficient classical simulation of mqc performed on ( efficient ) universal resource states is impossible . however , it is important to stress that classical simulation and non  universality are principally different issues .",
    "the question of which other resource states are also universal has been investigated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the required entanglement resources enabling universality were investigated . in particular",
    ", it was proven that certain entanglement measures , in particular certain _ entanglement width _ measures , must diverge on any universal resource , thus providing necessary conditions for universality .    on the other hand , the issue of classical simulation of mqc evidently brings us back to the central introductory questions posed above .",
    "results regarding the efficient simulation of mqc do exist , and it is e.g. known that any mqc implemented on a 1d cluster state can be simulated efficiently @xcite .",
    "more generally , the efficient description of quantum states in terms of ( tree ) tensor networks turns out to play an important role in this context @xcite .    in this article",
    "we strengthen the connection between classical simulation of mqc and non  universality .",
    "our starting point will be the no  go results for universality obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , stating that the entanglement monotones _ entropic entanglement width _ and _ schmidt  rank width _ must diverge on any universal resource ; both measures are closely related , and we refer to section [ sect_ewd ] for definitions .",
    "we then focus on the schmidt ",
    "rank width measure , and prove , as our first main result , that mqc can be efficiently simulated on every resource state which is ruled out by the above no  go result .",
    "more generally , we prove that mqc can be simulated efficiently on all states where the schmidt ",
    "rank width grows at most logarithmically with the system size @xcite .",
    "second , along the way of proving the above results , we provide a natural interpretation of the schmidt  rank width measure , as we show that this monotone quantifies what the optimal description of quantum states is in terms of tree tensor networks ; this shows that there is in fact a large overlap between the present research and the work performed in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the simulation of quantum systems using tree tensor networks .    as our third main result",
    ", we show that the schmidt ",
    "rank width ( and entanglement width ) ",
    "these are measures which are defined in terms of nontrivial optimization problems  can be computed efficiently for all graph states . moreover , for all graph states where the schmidt ",
    "rank width grows at most logarithmically with the number of qubits , we give efficient constructions of the optimal tree tensor networks describing these states .",
    "we further remark that the origin of the schmidt - rank width lies in fact in graph theory , and its definition is inspired by a graph invariant called _",
    "rank width_. it turns out that the study of rank width in graph theory shows strong similarities with the study of efficient descriptions and simulations of quantum systems , viz .",
    "the two introductory questions of this article .",
    "the similarity is due to the fact that , in certain aspects of both quantum information theory and graph theory , one is concerned with the efficient description of complex structures in terms of tree  like structures .",
    "we will comment on the existing parallels between these fields .    finally , we emphasize that the present work is situated in two different dynamic areas of research within the field of quantum information theory ; the first is the study of universality and classical simulation of measurement based quantum computation , and the second is the problem of efficiently describing quantum systems and their dynamics .",
    "an important aim of this article consists of bringing together existing results in both fields and showing that there is a strong connection between them ; in particular , we find that the notion of schmidt ",
    "rank width has been considered independently in refs . @xcite and @xcite and plays an important role in both areas of research . in order to establish the connections between these two areas in a transparent manner , a substantial part of this article",
    "is devoted to giving a clear overview of which relevant results are known in both fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ universality ]",
    "we discuss entanglement width and schmidt - rank width , and their role in universality and classical simulation of mqc . in section [ sect_tensor ] the description of states in terms of tree tensor networks",
    "is reviewed , and a connection to schmidt - rank width is established .",
    "this section also includes our main result , stating that any state with a logarithmically bounded schmidt - rank width has , in principle , an efficient description in terms of a tree tensor network , and hence any mqc performed on such states can be efficiently simulated classically . in section [ sect_grapstates ] these results",
    "are applied to graph states , and we provide in addition an explicit way of obtaining the optimal tree tensor network .",
    "we discuss the relation between the treatment of complex systems in quantum information theory and graph theory in section [ sect_complex ] , and summarize and conclude in section [ sect_conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we introduce two related multipartite entanglement measures called _ entropic entanglement width _ and _ schmidt  rank width _ and discuss their role in the studies of universality of resources for measurement based quantum computation ( mqc ) and in classical simulation of mqc .",
    "these entanglement measures are defined in section [ sect_ewd ] . in section [ sect_uni ]",
    "we review the definition of universal resources for mqc , and the use of the above measures in this study . in section [ sect_sim ]",
    "we consider the basic notions regarding efficient classical simulation of mqc .",
    "finally , in section [ sect_problem ] we pose the two central questions of this article in a precise way ; the first question asks about the interpretation of the measures entanglement width and schmidt  rank width , and the second deals with the role of these measures in the context of classical simulation of mqc .      the entropic entanglement width @xmath0 of an multi ",
    "party state @xmath1 is an entanglement measure introduced in ref .",
    "qualitatively , this measure computes the minimal bipartite entanglement entropy in the state @xmath1 , where the minimum is taken over specific classes of bipartitions of the system .",
    "the precise definition is the following .",
    "let @xmath1 be an @xmath2-party pure state .",
    "a _ tree _ is a graph with no cycles .",
    "let @xmath3 be a _",
    "tree , which is a tree such that every vertex has exactly 1 or 3 incident edges .",
    "the vertices which are incident with exactly one edge are called the _ leaves _ of the tree .",
    "we consider trees @xmath3 with exactly @xmath2 leaves @xmath4 , which are identified with the @xmath2 local hilbert spaces of the system .",
    "letting @xmath5 be an arbitrary edge of @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath6 the graph obtained by deleting the edge @xmath7 from @xmath3 .",
    "the graph @xmath6 then consists of exactly two connected components ( see fig .",
    "[ subcubic ] ) , which naturally induce a bipartition @xmath8 of the set @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the bipartite entanglement entropy of @xmath1 with respect to the bipartition @xmath8 by @xmath10 .",
    "the entropic entanglement width of the state @xmath1 is now defined by e_(|):= _ t_et  e_a_t^e , b_t^e(| ) , where the minimization is taken over all subcubic trees @xmath3 with @xmath2 leaves , which are identified with the @xmath2 parties in the system .",
    "thus , for a given tree @xmath3 we consider the maximum , over all edges in @xmath3 , of the quantity @xmath11 ; then the minimum , over all subcubic trees @xmath3 , of such maxima is computed .",
    "( 230,160 ) ( 0,0 ) ( a ) example of a subcubic tree @xmath3 with six leaves ( indicated in blue ) .",

    "one then obtains the _ schmidt ",
    "rank width _ , or _",
    "@xmath12width _ , denoted by @xmath13 . the precise definition is the following . letting @xmath14",
    "denote the number of non  zero schmidt coefficients of @xmath1 with respect to a bipartition @xmath8 of @xmath9 as defined above , the @xmath12width of the state @xmath1 is defined by [ chiwidth ] _",
    "( |):= _ t_et _ 2 _ a^e_t , b^e_t(| ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that @xmath15 is an entanglement monotone @xcite , i.e. , this measure vanishes on product states , is a local invariant , and decreases on average under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the proof can readily be extended to @xmath16 , demonstrating that also @xmath12width is a valid entanglement measure .",
    "in fact , using that the schmidt rank is non  increasing under _",
    "locc , or slocc , it can be proven that the @xmath12width is also non  increasing under slocc .    since the inequality _ 2 _ a , b(|)e_a , b(|)holds for any bipartition @xmath17 of the system and for any state @xmath1",
    ", we have _ ( | ) e _ ( |).note , however , that these quantities can show a completely different ( scaling ) behavior .",
    "it is clear that the definitions of entropic entanglement width and schmidt  rank width are based upon similar constructions , where optimizations are performed over subcubic trees .",
    "such constructions can of course be repeated for any bipartite entanglement measure ; hence a whole class of multipartite entanglement measures is obtained , which we will call the class of _ entanglement width measures_. the entropic entanglement width and @xmath12width are two examples of entanglement width measures .",
    "it would be interesting to consider other examples of entanglement width measures , and investigate their possible role in quantum information theory .",
    "the definitions of the above entanglement measures are inspired by a graph invariant called _ rank width _",
    ", which was introduced in ref .",
    "the connection with rank width is obtained by evaluating the entropic entanglement width or @xmath12width in _",
    "graph states_. this is explained next .",
    "first we recall the definition of graph states .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the pauli spin matrices .",
    "let @xmath19 be a graph with vertex set @xmath4 and edge set @xmath20 .",
    "for every vertex @xmath21 , the set @xmath22 denotes the set of neighbors of @xmath23 , i.e. , the collection of all vertices @xmath24 which are connected to @xmath23 by an edge @xmath25 .",
    "the graph state @xmath26 is then defined to be the unique @xmath2-qubit state which is the joint eigenstate , with eigenvalues equal to 1 , of the @xmath2 commuting correlation operators [ k_a ] k_a:= _ x^(a)_bn(a ) _",
    "z^(b).standard examples of graph states include the ghz states , and the 1d and 2d cluster states , which are obtained if the underlying graph is a 1d chain or a rectangular 2d grid , respectively .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "let @xmath27 be the @xmath28 adjacency matrix of @xmath29 , i.e , one has @xmath30 if @xmath25 and @xmath31 otherwise .",
    "for every bipartition @xmath17 of the vertex set @xmath9 , define @xmath32 to be the @xmath33 submatrix of @xmath27 defined by ( a , b ) : = ( _ ab)_aa , bb.using standard graph state techniques it can then be shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) that [ ctrk ] _ _ 2  ( a , b)&= & _ 2 _ a , b(|g ) + & = & e_a , b(|g).where @xmath34 denotes the rank of a matrix @xmath35 when arithmetic is performed over the finite field @xmath36 gf(2 ) . thus , the schmidt rank and the bipartite entanglement entropy w.r.t . any bipartition @xmath37 coincide for graph states , and are given by the rank of the matrix @xmath38 .",
    "using the identity ( [ ctrk ] ) , one immediately finds that the @xmath12width ( and entropic entanglement width ) of the graph state @xmath26 coincides with the _ rank width _",
    "rwd@xmath39 of the graph @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit definition of rwd@xmath39 reads @xcite ( g):= _ t_et _ _ 2 ( a_t^e , b_t^e)(where the minimization is again over subcubic trees as in the definition of @xmath12width ) , which , using ( [ ctrk ] ) , indeed coincides with the @xmath12width of @xmath26 .    note that the subcubic trees which are considered in the definition of rank width are not to be confused with the defining graph @xmath29 of the graph state @xmath26 ( the latter can be an arbitrary graph ) ; the subcubic trees merely serve as a means of selecting certain bipartitions of the system , independent of the state which is considered .",
    "for instance , if we consider a linear cluster state @xmath40 of six qubits , corresponding to a graph @xmath41 that is a linear chain , then the tree depicted in fig .",
    "[ subcubic ] corresponds to the optimal tree in the definition of the rank - width ( and @xmath12-width ) , leading to rwd@xmath42 .    in section [ sect_complex ]",
    "we will further comment on the motivations for the definition of rank width , and we will draw parallels with the study of complex systems in quantum information theory .      in ref .",
    "@xcite a definition for universality of families of states for mqc was put forward , and the use of @xmath15 to assess non  universality of states was demonstrated . in this section",
    "we briefly review the definition and the corresponding results .    consider an ( infinitely large ) family of qubit states = \\{|_1,|_2 ,  } , where @xmath43 is a state on @xmath44 qubits and @xmath45 for every @xmath46 .",
    "this family is called a _ universal resource for mqc _",

    "that is , any state @xmath47 can be prepared using only states within the family @xmath51 as resource .",

    ", we have not yet considered the efficiency with which states can be prepared using members of @xmath51 .",
    "an _ efficient _ universal resource @xmath51 is a universal resource having the property that all states that can be efficiently generated with a quantum gate network should also be efficiently generated from universal resource @xmath51 .",
    "we refer to ref .",

    "using the fact that there exist families of quantum states where the entropic entanglement width and @xmath12width grow unboundedly with the system size ( the 2d cluster states are such examples ) , it is then straightforward to show that any universal family of states @xmath63 must have unbounded entropic entanglement width and @xmath12width as well .",
    "more precisely , one has @xcite :    [ thm_ewd ] let @xmath51 be a universal resource for mqc .",

    "we refer to the literature for definitions .    in the remainder of this paper , we will focus on the @xmath12width measure .      rather than considering the question whether a family @xmath51 is a universal resource for mqc",
    ", one may also consider the question whether mqc on @xmath51 can be _ efficiently simulated _ on a classical computer .",
    "we will say that efficient classical simulation of mqc on a family of states @xmath51 is possible , if for every state @xmath48 it is possible to simulate every locc protocol on a classical computer with overhead poly@xmath68 , where @xmath44 denotes the number of qubits on which the state @xmath43 is defined , as before .",
    "we remark that an efficient classical description of the initial states @xmath43 is a necessary , but not necessarily a sufficient condition for efficient simulation on a classical computer .",
    "the issue of classical simulation of mqc has recently been considered by several authors . at this point",

    "@xcite it was showed that mqc on graphs with logarithmically bounded tree width @xcite can be simulated efficiently classically .",
    "note that the above result on tree width implies the two other results , as tree graphs ( and thus also 1d cluster graphs ) have tree width equal to 1 @xcite .",

    "the description of quantum systems in terms of tree tensor networks will play an important role in the present analysis , and will be reviewed in detail in section [ sect_tensor ] .",
    "although related , the issues of universality and classical simulation in mqc are fundamentally two different questions .",
    "most of us expect that any family @xmath51 for which classical simulation of mqc is possible , will not be an efficient universal resource ; this reflects the common belief that quantum computers are in some sense exponentially more powerful than classical machines ",
    "note , however , that so far there is no rigorous proof of this statement .",
    "while one expects the possibility of classical simulation of mqc to imply non  universality of a resource @xmath51 , the converse implication is certainly not believed to hold in general .",
    "indeed , it is highly likely that many non  universal families could still be used to implement specific quantum algorithms .",
    "it is clear that regarding the notion of @xmath12-width , and the above issues of universality and classical simulation of mqc , a number of open questions remain . in this section",

    "in this section we tackle questions ( q1 ) and ( q2 ) as stated in the previous section .",

    "we then arrive at the following result .",
    "let @xmath26 be a graph state on @xmath2 qubits and denote @xmath208 .",

    "note that , in particular , the conditions of the above theorem are fulfilled for all classes of graphs having bounded rank width , and thus efficient ttns can be computed in poly@xmath107 time for all such classes .      in this section",
    "we give an explicit example of the computation of the rank width , the optimal subcubic tree , and the corresponding ttn description of a particular graph state , namely the 6-qubit state @xmath210 associated to the _ cycle graph _ ( or _ ring graph _ ) @xmath211 on 6 vertices .",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath27 of @xmath211 is the @xmath212 matrix , where  @xmath213  denotes an entry equal to zero .",

    "it is now straightforward to show that _ et _ _ 2  ( a^e_t , b^e_t ) = 2 .",
    "this can be showed by simply computing the ranks of all matrices @xmath215 and picking the largest of these ranks .",

    "_ 2  ( a^e_t , b^e_t ) 2for every subcubic tree @xmath169 .",

    "second , suppose that @xmath169 is a subcubic tree such that @xmath217 ; we will show that this leads to a contradiction .",
    "note that rank@xmath218 is equal to 1 if and only if @xmath17 is a bipartition of the form ( one vertex  rest ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath217 , then one must have _ _ 2  ( a^e_t , b^e_t ) = 1for every @xmath219 .",
    "thus , every bipartition @xmath220 must be of the form ( one vertex  rest ) ; this leads to a contradiction .",
    "this shows that the inequality ( [ alpha ] ) is correct .",
    "we can therefore conclude that ( c_6):= _ t _ t(c_6 ) = 2and that the tree @xmath3 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ subcubic ] yields the optimum .    at this point",
    "we note that here ad hoc methods have been used to obtain the above result ; however , we remind the reader that general algorithms exist to calculate the rank width and the optimal tree , as cited in section [ sect_sim_graph ] .",
    "the computation of the ttn description of @xmath210 with underlying tree @xmath3 is performed in appendix [ app ] .",
    "the result is the following : [ c_6_ttn]x_1  x_6|c_6= _ abcdef ^(1)_abx_1x_2 ^(2)_abcdx_3^(3)_cdefx_4^(4)_efx_5x_6 , + where @xmath221 and where all indices in the sum run from 0 to 1 .",

    "we have seen that the @xmath12width of a graph state is equal to the rank width of the underlying graph .",
    "there is in fact a striking parallel between the _ motivations _ for the definitions of rank width of graphs and of @xmath12width of general quantum states , on which we comment here .",
    "as explained above , the @xmath12width gives information about the optimal ttn which describes a given quantum state .",
    "the interest in such ttns naturally arises due to the fact that the dynamics of quantum systems which allow ttn descriptions with sufficiently small dimension @xmath89 , can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "these and similar techniques ( cf .",
    "e.g. the matrix product states formalism ) are invoked because the efficient classical simulation of _ general _ quantum systems can be a very difficult problem .",
    "thus , in spite of the general hardness of this simulation problem , it becomes tractable when restricted to the class of those systems with efficient ttn descriptions .    in graph theory",
    "an analogous situation occurs .",
    "while many interesting problems are hard to compute on general graphs , they become tractable for those classes of graphs which can be associated , through certain constructions , with tree structures .",
    "the simplest examples are of course the tree graphs themselves , which are in some sense the simplest instances of graphs ; and indeed , many difficult problems become efficiently solvable , or even trivial , on trees .",
    "however , this is far from the whole story . in graph theory one",
    "has considered a variety of so  called _ width parameters _ , which all measure , in different ways , how similar a graph is to a tree graph .",
    "examples are rank width , tree width , clique  width , path  width , and branch  width .",
    "it has been shown that for families of graphs where a given width parameter is _ bounded _ , large classes of ( np)hard problems have efficient solutions . for example , the problem of deciding whether a graph is 3colorable , which is a np  hard , is efficiently solvable when restricted to classes of graphs of bounded rank width .",
    "the graph theoretical results in this context are often very general and far  reaching ; e.g. , it has been show that all graph problems which can be formulated in terms of a certain mathematical logic calculus , have efficient solutions when restricted to graphs of bounded rank width . we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for an accessible treatment of these and related issues .",
    "thus , in certain aspects of both quantum information theory and graph theory there is a natural interest in using tree structures for the approximation of complex systems .",
    "moreover , there seems to be a strong parallel in the explicit constructions which are used in both fields .",
    "a striking example is obtained here , as the rank width of graphs exactly coincides with the @xmath12width measure on graph states . as a second example",
    ", it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the efficient contraction of large tensor network is directly related to the tree width of the underlying graphs .",
    "the present authors believe that the aforementioned parallel can significantly be exploited further .",
    "in this paper we have considered the possibility to classically simulate measurement based quantum computation .",
    "we have shown that all states with a bounded or logarithmically growing schmidt ",
    "rank width can in fact be described efficiently , and moreover any one  way quantum computation performed on such states can also be simulated efficiently .",
    "we have given an interpretation of the schmidt ",
    "rank width , a measure that has its origin in graph theory , in terms of the optimal tree tensor network describing a state .",
    "we have also provided a constructive procedure how to obtain the optimal ttn , and discussed the requirements that this can be done efficiently . for graph states ,",
    "we have explicitly constructed the corresponding ttn , and provided an efficient algorithm to do this for any graph state where the underlying graph has bounded or logarithmically growing rank width .",
    "these results on efficient simulation complement recent findings on universality of states , in the sense that all states that are found to be non ",
    "universal resources for mqc using the schmidt ",
    "rank width criteria ( i.e. which have bounded schmidt ",
    "rank width ) can also be simulated efficiently on a classical computer .",
    "the connection to complexity issues in graph theory , also highlighted in this paper , seems to provide future possibilities for a fruitful interchange of concepts and methods between the fields of quantum information and graph theory .",
