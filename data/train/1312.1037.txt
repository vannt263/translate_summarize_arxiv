    "co - channel interference is generally considered as a hindrance while improving the throughput of a @xmath1user wireless network . in 2007 ,",
    "jafar and shamai introduced the concept of interference alignment ( ia ) in a @xmath2user x - channel @xcite and later , cadambe and jafar @xcite applied the ia concept in a @xmath1user interference channel ( ic ) and showed that each user gets @xmath3 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) irrespective of the number of the interfering signals seen by the receiver , where @xmath4 represents the number of dimensions available for transmission . in @xcite",
    "ergodic ia was used to achieve @xmath3 dof .",
    "however , the ia schemes in @xcite require perfect channel knowledge of all the desired and interfering channels at each transmitter ( or equivalently , requires a centralized controller which designs the precoders , and sends them respectively to each transmitter ) .    in practice",
    ", it is very difficult to implement the conventional ia schemes @xcite because of the requirement of perfect channel knowledge .",
    "hence in @xcite and @xcite , jafar introduced a blind ia ( b - ia ) scheme which exploits the correlation present in the channel , i.e. , channel should have specific states to achieve the alignment of interference since channel state information at the transmitter  ( csit ) is not available . in @xcite ,",
    "the channel states required for b - ia to work were achieved through a staggered antenna switching scheme at the receiver . in @xcite ,",
    "a retrospective ia scheme was introduced which uses delayed csit to achieve the alignment of interfering signals .",
    "furthermore , practical communication links use finite alphabet ( fa ) constellations such as @xmath5qam signals , whereas the ia schemes @xcite assume the usage of gaussian signals at each transmitter .",
    "hence , we proposed in @xcite the fractional interference alignment ( fia ) scheme where the alignment of interference is based on new set of constraints ( as briefly discussed in section [ sec : fiaoverview ] ) , which explicitly considers the usage of fa signals at all the transmitters .",
    "a new metric named spac was introduced @xcite , and it was shown that using the fia scheme any value of spac in the full range @xmath0 $ ] can be achieved .",
    "numerical results were provided in @xcite where the fia precoder design was compared with the existing ia precoder design , and was shown to achieve a better ber performance . once again , like the ia scheme , the fia scheme also requires accurate csit to attain the maximum spac value of @xmath6 per transmitter , which is practically not feasible .",
    "hence , in our current work , a novel blind fractional interference alignment ( b - fia ) scheme is introduced , based on the following two practical considerations or constraints : ( i )  fa signals are used at all the transmitters , and ( ii )  csit is not available . like the fia scheme ,",
    "the b - fia scheme is a collection of all precoder designs which satisfy the constraints , @xmath7 , but without csit , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the desired signal subspace and interfering signal subspace at the receiver , respectively .",
    "also , b - fia can be viewed as an extension of the b - ia scheme in @xcite and @xcite , with the additional practical choice of fa transmit signals .",
    "however , there is another key difference between the b - ia and b - fia schemes : b - ia requires specific channel states to achieve the dof @xcite , while the proposed b- fia does not impose any such unrealistic condition on the channel states . in this work",
    ", it will be analytically shown that the maximum achievable value of spac , for a multi input multi output ( mimo ) broadcast and interfering channels , is @xmath10 , when @xmath11 .",
    "it must be mentioned that the maximum achievable value of spac for the case when @xmath12 is still an open problem . here",
    ", @xmath4 represents the number of transmitter antennas , @xmath13 represents the number of receiver antennas , and @xmath14 represents the symbol extension factor .",
    "we also propose a simple precoder design which achieves this maximum value of spac , and satisfies the required constraint ,  @xmath7 .",
    "the proposed precoder structure has an advantage for single input single output ( siso ) channels .",
    "this advantage is that the statistics of the interfering signal can be estimated from the received data signals , i.e. , no external controls or pilot signals are required to estimate the statistics of the interfering signal .",
    "hence , we term this precoder design as complete b - fia ( cb - fia ) design where interference channel state information at receiver ( i - csir ) is not required .",
    "however , the cb - fia scheme can achieve the maximum value of spac only for siso links .. ] a general channel model is considered while obtaining the maximum achievable spac in the b - fia scheme , and it can not be compared with b - ia scheme ( which requires specific channel states @xcite ) . hence , in this work , we do not compare the proposed b - fia scheme with the b - ia scheme .",
    "we also discuss two detectors for the cb - fia scheme , namely : ( i )  maximum likelihood ( ml ) detector , and ( ii )  minimum distance ( md ) detector . the estimation procedure required for obtaining the statistics of the interfering signals",
    "is also discussed .    in summary",
    ", we introduce the b - fia scheme which is the collection of precoder designs that satisfies the constraint @xmath15 .",
    "analytically , we show that the maximum achievable value of spac is @xmath10 , and introduce a simple precoder design to achieve the maximum value of spac . for siso , the proposed precoder design has an inherent advantage of not requiring the i - csir , and hence we term it as the scheme .",
    "finally , we compare the bit error rate ( ber ) performance of the ml and md detectors considered for this b - fia scheme .",
    "span(@xmath16 ) is the column space of the matrix @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the dimension of the column space of @xmath16 or the rank of the matrix @xmath16 , with some abuse of notation we represent the @xmath17 by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 represents the @xmath20 identity matrix .",
    "further , @xmath21 represents the set containing all possible values of the transmitted symbol vector @xmath22 and the elements are assumed to be ordered , @xmath23 represents the @xmath24 vector element of the set @xmath21 , @xmath25 is the collection of all distance metric at @xmath26 receiver , and @xmath27}$ ] represents the distance between @xmath23 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , at the @xmath26 receiver .",
    "finally , @xmath30 represents the axis vector whose ith element is unity and all other elements are zero .",
    "a @xmath1user bc model consists of one transmitter with @xmath4 antennas and @xmath1receivers with @xmath13 antennas each .",
    "the considered scenario is bc with multiple multicast messages , i.e. , the single transmitter transmits independent data signals to each receiver .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath26 receiver is given  by , @xmath31 where    * @xmath32  received signal at @xmath26 receiver of dimension @xmath33 , * @xmath34  transmitted signal intended for @xmath24 receiver of dimension @xmath35 , * @xmath36  complex gaussian noise , @xmath37 , * @xmath38  channel between the transmitter and @xmath26 receiver of dimension @xmath39 , * @xmath40  precoder matrix for @xmath34 of dimension @xmath41 , * @xmath14  symbol extension factor .    in @xcite , it was shown that in the @xmath2user bc with no csit , the achievable dof is @xmath42 when the transmitter is equipped with @xmath43 antennas , and each receiver is equipped with @xmath6 antenna .",
    "this dof was achieved for a specific channel state obtained by exploiting the correlation present in the channel response across time and frequency .",
    "the channel structure seen at the @xmath43 receivers , and the corresponding precoder matrices are given by , @xcite , @xmath44 the result in @xcite is an extension of the b - ia in @xcite for a @xmath1user bc , where the required channel state is achieved by assuming that each receiver is equipped with @xmath4 antennas . of the @xmath4",
    "receive antennas , only one antenna is used at each time slot , where the method of antenna selection @xcite guarantees b - ia . and",
    ", b - ia can achieve @xmath45 dof .",
    "we first describe the b - ia scheme in the interference channel before discussing the proposed b - fia scheme .",
    "a @xmath1user ic model consists of @xmath46 transmitters with @xmath4 antennas each and @xmath1receivers with @xmath13 antennas each .",
    "each transmitter has a useful message to only one receiver , and each receiver receives useful message from only one transmitter .",
    "the presence of other transmitters results in @xmath47 interfering terms getting added to the desired signal at each of the @xmath46 receivers .",
    "the received signal at the @xmath26 receiver is given by , @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the channel between the @xmath24 transmitter and @xmath26 receiver of dimension @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the precoder matrix for @xmath34 of dimension @xmath41 , and @xmath14 is the symbol extension factor .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that with no csit , the achievable dof is @xmath50 , provided that all the desired channel gains @xmath38 are time varying within one block ( of @xmath14 symbols ) , while all the interfering channels @xmath51 are constant within that block .",
    "the b - ia scheme for both bc and ic scenarios assumes the use of a linear receiver ; i.e. , the precoder design constraints are based on linear detection .",
    "however , when fa signals are used , the optimum receiver is based on either the map or ml ( maximum a - posteriori or maximum likelihood ) principle , and in practical scenarios , ber will be the performance measure .",
    "hence , spac was introduced in @xcite to show the advantage of the fia scheme when fa signals are used .",
    "the value of spac for bc and ic is @xmath45 and @xmath50 respectively , using the b - eia scheme .",
    "however , the scheme requires the special channel states which might not occur in a practical scenario .",
    "also , as mentioned earlier there is no constraint on the channel matrices for b - fia scheme .",
    "hence , we do not compare the spac of the b - fia scheme with the b - eia scheme . in this work ,",
    "we will obtain the maximum achievable value of spac for the b - fia scheme for both bc and ic where the precoder design constraints are based on the non - linear minimum distance ( md ) detector @xcite .",
    "we also provide a simple precoder design to achieve that value of spac .",
    "the fia scheme was introduced for the scenario where all the transmitters uses fa signals , and in such a scenario , the optimal receiver is a non - linear receiver .",
    "the precoder design constraint for the fia scheme is given by @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 represent the subspace occupied by the desired signal and the interfering signal , respectively , at the @xmath26 receiver .",
    "for a @xmath1user ic , the constraint ( [ eqn : fiaconst ] ) can be rewritten as ,    [ eqn : fiaconst_kic ] @xmath55    using the constraints in ( [ eqn : fiaconst_kic ] ) , it was shown in @xcite that any value of spac in the full range @xmath0 $ ] is asymptotically achievable , for @xmath1user ic when csit is available . in a practical scenario , it is very difficult to make available accurate csit available . each receiver can usually estimate the desired channel @xmath38 , but estimating ( and feeding back ) the interfering channels @xmath49 might not be feasible unless special pilot structures are available for the same .",
    "hence , the question to be answered is , _ ` with no csit , what is the maximum achievable value of spac ? ' _    it will be shown in section [ sec : bfiaprecoders ] that the spac given in table  [ tab : different_spacbcic ] is the maximum value achievable when md detector is used .",
    "the design criteria for the blind fractional interference alignment scheme is influenced by : ( i )  the usage of fa signal set at each transmitter , ( ii )  the availability of an appropriate non - linear receiver , and ( iii )  the non - availability of csit at each transmitter ( or equivalently , the absence of a centralized controller ) . in this section",
    ", we will provide the maximum achievable value of spac in siso , simo and mimo ( with @xmath11 ) scenarios for both bc and ic .",
    "it must be mentioned here that all the proofs provided in this section assume the number of transmit antenna is less than the number of receive antenna .",
    "for mimo with @xmath56 , the number of dimensions each sub - space occupies is still limited by the number of receiver antennas , @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath57 , which is equivalent to having @xmath13 antennas at the transmitter .",
    "hence , the results obtained will hold only for the case when the transmitters are equipped with @xmath13 antennas . as mentioned earlier , for @xmath56",
    "( miso is a special case with @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) , the maximum achievable value of spac is still an open problem .    in the next two sub - sections ( section [ subsec : bc_b - fia ] and [ subsec : ic_b - fia ] )",
    ", we will show that the spac values given in table [ tab : different_spacbcic ] are the maximum values for the respective scenarios . in section  [ subsec : precstr ]",
