    "= -2 cm [ sec : int ] [ sec : intro ]    it is generally thought that when an accreting c - o white dwarf ( wd ) approaches the chandrasekhar mass @xmath11 , the carbon ignites in its core , causing the wd to explode and produce a type ia supernova ( sn ) . if , however , the wd s composition is o - ne instead of c - o , the outcome may be qualitatively different : electron captures on nuclei will cause the wd to collapse to a neutron star ( ns ) before an explosion can ensue ( miyaji et al .",

    "2002 ) .    despite its likely occurrence in nature ,",
    "aic has not yet been observationally identified , probably because it is less common and produces less @xmath6ni than a normal sn ( e.g. , woosley @xmath15 baron 1992 ) . identifying aic or constraining its rate",
    "would , however , provide unique insights into the paths of degenerate binary evolution , the true progenitors of type ia sne ( e.g. , yungelson @xmath15 livio 1998 ) , and the formation channels of globular cluster nss ( grindlay 1987 ) , low mass x - ray binaries ( van den heuvel 1984 ; michel 1987 ) , and millisecond pulsars ( grindlay @xmath15 bailyn 1988 ; bailyn @xmath15 grindlay 1990 ) .",
    "identifying the optical signature of aic is also important because these events may be a source of strong gravitational wave emission ( fryer et al .",

    "although little @xmath6ni is ejected by the newly - formed proto - ns itself , we show that powerful winds from the accretion disks formed during aic produce up to a few times @xmath5 in @xmath6ni .",
    "figure @xmath17 summarizes the stages of aic . due to their preceding accretion ,",

    "piro , @xmath15 quataert ( 2008a , b ; hereafter mpq08a , b ) we studied the time - dependent evolution of accretion disks with similar initial properties that are formed from black hole ( bh)-ns or ns - ns mergers .",
    "many of these results also apply to proto - ns accretion following aic .",
    "although the disk is initially concentrated just outside the proto - ns surface , the bulk of the disk s mass must spread to larger radii as matter accretes in order to conserve angular momentum .",
    "early in their evolution , such `` hyper - accreting '' disks are neutrino - cooled and geometrically thin , and their composition is driven neutron - rich by an equilibrium between electron and positron captures under degenerate conditions ( e.g. , pruet et al .  2003 ;",
    "@xmath17b ) : the electron fraction @xmath0 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the proton / neutron number densities . as the disk",
    "viscously spreads and its temperature decreases , however , weak interactions eventually become slow compared to the evolution timescale of the disk and the value of @xmath1 freezes out .",
    "soon following freeze - out , neutrino cooling becomes inefficient and the disk becomes advective and geometrically thick ( mpq08a , b ) . since advective disks are only marginally bound , powerful winds likely begin to unbind most of the disk s remaining mass ( blandford @xmath15 begelman 1999 ) , aided by the nuclear energy released as @xmath21particles begin to form ( lee @xmath15 ramirez - ruiz 2007 ; mpq08a , b ) . because @xmath22 of the initial disk mass @xmath23 still remains when the disk becomes advective ( or when @xmath21particles form ) , a robust consequence of disk formation during aic is the ejection of up to a few times @xmath5 .",
    "since the ejecta are hot and dense , heavy isotopes are synthesized as they expand away from the midplane and cool .",
    "because weak interactions are already slow by this point , which heavy isotopes are produced depends on @xmath1 in the disk at freeze out .    in the case of bh accretion following bh - ns or ns - ns mergers ,",
    "the disk freezes out neutron - rich with an electron fraction @xmath24 ( mpq08a , b ) . a crucial difference in the case of aic",
    ", however , is the presence of the central proto - ns , which radiates a substantial flux of electron neutrinos as it deleptonizes during the first few seconds following core bounce ( e.g. , burrows @xmath15 lattimer 1986 ) .",

    "we present calculations of the evolution of the accretion disks formed from aic using time - dependent height - integrated simulations with initial conditions and neutrino irradiation taken from the aic simulations of d06 .",
    "we show that due to @xmath25 absorptions , a substantial fraction of the disk freezes out with @xmath28 . as a result",
    ", late time outflows from the disk primarily synthesize @xmath6ni ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]d ) .",
    "we discuss the observational signature of these ni - rich outflows in @xmath29 , and we conclude in @xmath30 by evaluating the prospects for detecting aic with upcoming optical transient surveys and as electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources .",
    "the equations and assumptions employed here closely follow those in @xmath313.1 of mpq08b for ns - ns or bh - ns mergers . to provide a brief summary , we evolve the surface density @xmath32 , temperature @xmath33 , and electron fraction @xmath1 as a function of radius @xmath34 and time @xmath35 using the 2n - rk3 scheme described in brandenburg ( 2001 ) . we employ an `` @xmath3 '' prescription for the viscosity ( shakura @xmath15 sunyaev 1973 ) , with the accretion stress proportional to the gas pressure .",
    "our calculation includes all of the relevant neutrino cooling processes for both optically thin and optically thick disks ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "we take the initial surface density @xmath36 from the keplerian disk that forms soon after core bounce in the aic calculations of d06 .",
    "we focus on the 1.46@xmath37 wd model of d06 , which collapses to form a @xmath38 disk that extends from the ns surface at @xmath39 km out to several ns radii ( see fig .  5 of d06 ) .",
    "we evolve @xmath1 including both local @xmath40 pair captures ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and non - local neutrino absorptions ( @xmath26 and @xmath43 ) due to irradiation from the central proto - ns .",
    "we approximate the neutrino flux from the proto - ns as arising from a `` light bulb '' at the origin because the neutrino capture rates only become important relative to the pair capture rates when the disk has spread to a radius which is much larger than that of the central ns .",
    "we neglect the disk s neutrino luminosity because it is small compared to the proto - ns luminosity .",
    "we assume that the disk s initial electron fraction is @xmath44 , i.e. , that of the wd prior to collapse .    the neutrino absorption rates are proportional to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the neutrino luminosities and mean energies , respectively , from the proto - ns . during the first @xmath48 s following core bounce , we use @xmath49 and @xmath50 from d06 ( specifically , their values in the equator ; see their fig .",
    "the @xmath51 flux peaks at a very large value ( @xmath52 ergs s@xmath14 ) at early times , after the shock created at core bounce `` breaks out '' of the proto - ns s neutrinosphere .",
    "the flux at later times @xmath53 s ) is dominated by the cooling proto - ns , with @xmath51 remaining @xmath54 as the proto - ns deleptonizes ( burrows @xmath15 lattimer 1986 ) .",
    "note that because @xmath55 during most of the first second following core bounce , the rate of @xmath25 captures exceeds the rate of @xmath56 captures and the net effect of neutrino absorptions is to drive @xmath1 to a value @xmath57 ( qian et al .",
    "this result is robust since shock break - out and deleptonization are generic features of ns formation ( e.g. , burrows @xmath15 mazurek 1983 ) ; indeed , we find similar results using luminosities and mean energies from the rotating core - collapse simulations of thompson , quataert , @xmath15 burrows ( 2005 ) .",
    "when necessary , for @xmath58 s we take @xmath59 , motivated by the calculations of pons et al .  ( 1999 ) , and assume @xmath60 , as appropriate for a blackbody with a fixed radius .",
    "although the neutrino luminosities and spectra at such late times are somewhat uncertain , we find that for @xmath61 the disk evolves sufficiently rapidly that our results are relatively insensitive to the precise values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 at late times .",
    "the viscous and thermal evolution of the accretion disks formed from aic are very similar to those presented in mpq08b for ns - ns / ns - bh mergers , so we refer the reader to this work for a detailed discussion of the overall evolution of the disk .",
    "the major qualitative difference between aic and ns - ns / ns - bh merger disks is the evolution of the electron fraction , so we focus on our results for @xmath1 below .",
    "figure @xmath62 shows histograms of mass as a function of electron fraction @xmath63 for our fiducial model that employs an initial density profile and neutrino irradiation from the 1.46@xmath37 wd model of d06 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show calculations performed with viscosity @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the top panel shows @xmath63 when @xmath66 of the disk s mass has become advective , which corresponds to a time @xmath67 s for @xmath68 .",
    "annuli in the disk are considered advective once the neutrino cooling rate becomes @xmath69 of the viscous heating rate .",
    "the bottom panel shows @xmath63 when @xmath66 of the disk s mass has fused into @xmath21particles , which corresponds to a time @xmath70 s for @xmath68 .",
    "although powerful outflows likely begin when the disk becomes advective ( blandford @xmath15 begelman 1999 ) , thermonuclear disruption of the disk is assured once @xmath21particles form .",
    "this occurs because ( 1 ) the nuclear reactions that create ( and destroy ) deuterium ( the building blocks of @xmath21particles ) are still very fast compared to the evolution timescale of the disk ( i.e. , the disk is still in nuclear statistical equilibrium [ nse ] ) when the temperature drops sufficiently that the nse @xmath21particle mass fraction becomes @xmath71 unity ( e.g. , chen @xmath15 beloborodov 2007 , eq .",
    "[ 13 ] ) ; and ( 2 ) the energy released by forming @xmath21particles ( @xmath72 mev per nucleon ) exceeds the disk s gravitational binding energy ( see mpq08a , b ) .",
    "thus , the distributions in figure @xmath62 roughly bracket the distribution of @xmath1 in the outflows that carry away the remaining mass in the disk at late times .",
    "figure @xmath62 shows that @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 of the initial disk mass ) remains when the disk is largely advective .",
    "a comparable amount of mass remains when the disk forms @xmath21particles because this occurs at approximately the same time ( mpq08a , b ; beloborodov 2008 ) .",
    "although the bulk of the disk is initially driven neutron - rich by degenerate electron captures , figure @xmath62 shows that a large portion of the mass remaining at late times has @xmath28 . as discussed in @xmath75 , the disk composition",
    "is driven proton - rich by the powerful @xmath25 flux from the central proto - ns .",
    "we have performed similar calculations for other disk parameters in order to study the sensitivity of our results to the disk s initial properties ( see table @xmath76 ) .",
    "for example , the disks found by d06,07 are fairly massive , but a less massive disk would result from a slower rotating wd .",
    "thus , we have also performed calculations using the same initial density profile from d06 , but normalizing the total initial disk mass to @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 .",
    "we have also calculated models with @xmath36 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 taken from the rapidly rotating , 1.92 @xmath37 wd model of d06 , which formed a more massive initial disk ( @xmath81 ) . in the high @xmath23 case we find that a significant fraction of the disk has exactly @xmath82 at freeze - out .",
    "this occurs because in this model @xmath21particle formation precedes weak freeze - out ; thus , any excess free neutrons or protons are almost immediately captured into @xmath21particles ( which have @xmath82 ) following a neutrino absorption ( the `` alpha - effect '' of fuller @xmath15 meyer 1995 ) . in table",
    "[ table : yef ] we summarize our results for the total mass ( @xmath83 ) and the total mass with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) when the disk has become @xmath66 advective .",
    "the latter is labeled @xmath85 because a significant fraction of the mass ejected with @xmath1 in this range produces @xmath6ni ( see @xmath29 ) . in all cases , we find that a significant fraction ( @xmath86 ) of the mass remaining at late times has @xmath28 . thus , under a variety of conditions , aic leads to @xmath87 of the initial disk being ejected as moderately proton - rich material .",

    "in some ways , aic can be considered a `` failed '' type ia sn because it does not produce @xmath94 of shock - heated ejecta .",

    "in @xmath27 we showed that if an accretion disk forms around the proto - ns during collapse , a natural consequence of the disk s subsequent evolution is that up to @xmath96 of material with @xmath28 is ejected within a few seconds after core bounce .",
    "when hyper - accreting disks become radiatively inefficient and begin forming @xmath21particles , gas and radiation pressure in the midplane are comparable and the entropy is @xmath97 k@xmath98 baryon@xmath14 .",
    "subsequent outflows from the disk are likely to possess a comparable entropy because heating that occurs as matter is unbound ( e.g. , due to @xmath21particle formation ) is unlikely to deposit more than a few k@xmath98 baryon@xmath14 .",
    "a typical outflow speed is @xmath99 c : this is approximately the escape speed from the disk when it becomes advective and a similar speed is attained from the @xmath100 mev baryon@xmath14 released in producing fe - peak elements .",
    "matter with @xmath84 that begins in nse at low entropy and expands adiabatically at mildly relativistic speeds is primarily synthesized into @xmath6ni ( e.g. , pruet et al .",
    "2004 ) because @xmath6ni is favored in nse under proton - rich conditions ( seitenzahl et al .",
    "our results in figure [ fig : yef ] and table [ table : yef ] therefore imply that aic outflows yield a typical ni mass @xmath101 if the rotating 1.46@xmath37-wd progenitors used in the calculations of d06,07 are representative .",
    "the decay of this ni can reheat the ( adiabatically cooled ) ejecta sufficiently to produce detectable transient emission once the outflow expands sufficiently that photons can diffuse out ( arnett 1982 ) .",
    "we explore this possibility by calculating the light curves of ejecta heated by ni decay using the method of kulkarni ( 2005 ) and mpq08a .",
    "figure [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the v and j - band luminosities as a function of time since collapse for an outflow with ni mass @xmath102 and total ejecta mass @xmath103 expanding at @xmath104 c. the total luminosity peaks in the visual ( v - band ) on a @xmath7 day timescale , with @xmath105 ergs s@xmath14 .",
    "the j - band light curve peaks somewhat later than v - band because the temperature at the photosphere decreases as the material expands .",
    "we discuss the likelihood of detecting such a transient with blind surveys in @xmath30 .",
    "although @xmath6ni is likely to be the dominant isotope synthesized , other isotopes will also be produced in smaller abundances .",
    "for instance , under the conditions of interest @xmath87 of the ejected mass may remain in the form of @xmath21particles ( woosley @xmath15 hoffman 1992 ) .",
    "furthermore , our low-@xmath3 calculations in figure [ fig : yef ] indicate that some fraction of the material ejected may have @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yef ] ) . in this case , freeze - out from nse produces both stable ( e.g. , @xmath107ni , @xmath108fe ) and radioactive ( e.g. , @xmath109ni , @xmath110zn ) fe - group elements instead of @xmath6ni ( woosley @xmath15 hoffman 1992 ) .",
    "although this material will contribute to the opacity of the outflow ( @xmath111 above ) , its additional contribution to the radioactive heating is unlikely to substantially alter the purely ni - powered light curves in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "because aic has never been observationally identified , its rate is uncertain .",
    "binary population synthesis models predict galactic rates in the range @xmath112 yr@xmath14 ( e.g. , yungelson @xmath15 livio 1998 ) .",
    "the amount of highly neutron - rich material ejected per aic can also be used to constrain the aic rate ( hartmann et al .",
    "1985 ; fryer et al .  1999 ) : if the @xmath113 of ejected material with @xmath114 in the calculations of d06 is representative , @xmath115 must be @xmath116 yr@xmath14 so as not to over - produce the abundances of neutron - rich isotopes in our solar system .",
    "if the proto - ns forms with a strong large - scale magnetic field @xmath117 g , then a much larger quantity @xmath8 of neutron - rich material is ejected by the proto - ns s magneto - centrifugally driven wind ( d07 ; metzger , thompson , @xmath15 quataert 2008 ) and the aic rate is constrained to be even lower .",
    "assuming that the aic rate is proportional to the blue stellar luminosity ( phinney 1991 ) , a galactic rate of @xmath118 yr@xmath14 corresponds to a volumetric rate of @xmath119 mpc@xmath120 yr@xmath14 . for the 1.46@xmath37-wd model of d06",
    ", we predict that aic produces an optical transient with a peak luminosity @xmath121 ergs s@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum detection distance of 650(410)[100 ] mpc for a limiting magnitude of 25(24)[21 ] .",
    "thus , the panstarrs medium deep survey ( mds ) , which covers @xmath122 deg@xmath123 in @xmath124 and @xmath34 down to ab magnitude 25 , will detect @xmath125 yr@xmath14 .",
    "the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) , which surveys @xmath126 deg@xmath123 to a limiting ab magnitude of 21 , will detect @xmath127 yr@xmath14 .",
    "thus , if @xmath128 yr@xmath14 , mds and ptf should detect a few aic events per year .",
    "prospects for detection are much better with the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , which will image the entire sky down to a limiting magnitude @xmath129 every 3 - 4 nights and should detect aic events at a rate @xmath130 yr@xmath14 .",
    "the short , few - day timescale of the transient requires observations with high cadence .",
    "shallow , wider - area surveys such as ptf may be preferable because separating the transient from its host galaxy s light may be difficult for high redshift events .",
    "the detectability of an optical transient is sensitive to whether there is sufficient mass in a remnant disk , which in turn depends on the angular momentum distribution of the wd progenitor .",
    "the very massive aic progenitor from d06 ( 1.92 @xmath37 ) is consistent with the large shear found by yoon @xmath15 langer ( 2004 , 2005 ) , who studied angular momentum transport by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities during accretion .",
    "piro ( 2008 ) argued , however , that large magnetic stresses impose nearly solid body rotation , which prevents the wd from reach a mass much over the ( non - rotating ) chandrasekhar limit ( this may also be the case for purely hydrodynamic instabilities ; see saio @xmath15 nomoto 2004 ) .",
    "more work is needed to understand the possible progenitors of aic , and the resulting implications for the accretion disk formed during collapse , taking into account the effects of magnetic stresses and compositional gradients on the redistribution of angular momentum during accretion .",
    "other thermal transients are predicted to occur in nature on @xmath71 day timescales , such as `` .ia '' sne due to unstable thermonuclear he flashes from wd binaries ( bildsten et al .",
    "although such events may originate from a similar stellar population and could be confused with aic , a defining characteristic of aic outflows is that most of the ejected material is processed through low entropy nse . as a result , we expect few intermediate - mass elements to be produced ( such as o , ca , and mg ) , although small amounts of he may be present .",
    "thus , the ni - rich explosions produced by aic should be spectroscopically distinct from other types of sn identified to date .",
    "the timescale , velocity , and composition of the aic transient can be modified if significant amounts of wd material remain at large radii following aic , either because the wd is still collapsing at late times or because some matter remains centrifugally supported in a remnant disk created by a super - m@xmath131 wd - wd merger ( e.g. , yoon et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the later case ,",
    "depending on the mass and composition of the wd binary , up to @xmath8 in c , o , ne , or he could remain at a radius @xmath132 cm .",
    "once the ni wind ( with energy @xmath133 ergs ) impacts this remnant material , it will ( 1 ) shock heat the material to a few times @xmath134 k , which may synthesize intermediate mass elements ( woosley et al .",
    "2002 ) , but will not disassociate the ni and will likely leave some unburned wd material ; ( 2 ) slow the ejecta from @xmath135 c to a few thousand km s@xmath14 . a combination of slower ejecta and higher opacity would also lengthen the duration of the light curve by a factor of @xmath136 from that shown in figure @xmath137 , making such an event easier to detect .",
    "indeed , such an `` enshrouded aic '' model represents a possible explanation for sub - luminous , sub - chandrasekhar type i sne , such as 2008 ha , which rose to its peak brightness in only @xmath136 days , possessed low line velocities ( @xmath138 km s@xmath14 ) , and was inferred to have @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( foley et al .",
    "we plan to study this possibility further , as well as explore the interaction between the disk wind and the outoing sn shock , in future work .",
    "aic may also be detectable with upcoming km - scale gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors such as advanced ligo and virgo .",
    "if the collapse remains axisymmetric , the detection of aic in gws appears unlikely except within the milky way ( d06,07 ; dimmelmeier et al .",
    "however , if the progenitor wd is very rapidly rotating ( as may result following a wd - wd merger ) , the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy of the proto - ns upon collapse may be sufficiently large for the growth of nonaxisymmetric instabilities , which would greatly increase the gw signal and detection prospects ( fryer et al .  2002 ; ott 2008 ) .",
    "indeed , d06 find that their their 1.92 @xmath37-wd model rotates sufficiently rapidly to trigger a dynamically unstable spiral mode upon collapse ( ott et al .",
    "we note that our calculations predict that large ni yields will accompany the massive disks that form from such rapidly rotating progenitors ( e.g. , we find @xmath141 for d06 s 1.92@xmath37 model ; see table @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , events accompanied by gw emission that is detectable to extragalactic distances will likely produce a somewhat brighter sn transient than our fiducial example in figure @xmath137 .",
    "more generally , the brightness of the optical emission from aic directly traces the importance of rotation during the collapse .",
