    "1999 , hereafter paper 1 ) we have carried out detailed modelling of the synchrotron radiation of cas  a from the radio to the x - ray bands in order to understand the relativistic electron content in the source .",
    "the principal feature of our study in paper 1 was that we have proposed a _ spatially inhomogeneous _ model , consisting of two zones , that distinguishes between compact , bright steep - spectrum radio knots and the bright fragmented radio ring on the one hand , and the remainder of the shell - the diffuse ` plateau ' - on the other hand . in this paper",
    ", using the model parameters derived from the interpretation of synchrotron fluxes observed , we calculate the fluxes of @xmath0-rays predicted in the framework of the spatially inhomogeneous study of this snr , and discuss implications which can be derived from future @xmath0-ray observations of this snr in different energy bands . in section 2 , after a brief overview of the basic features of the model , we study the fluxes to be expected for @xmath0-ray energies up to @xmath11 .",
    "this emission is contributed mostly by bremsstrahlung of those electrons which are responsible for the synchrotron emission in the radio - to - infrared bands . in section 3",
    "we discuss the fluxes expected in the very high energy region , @xmath12 , where both bremsstrahlung and inverse compton radiation of relativistic electrons are important .",
    "in addition , a significant contribution to the total fluxes could be due to @xmath2-decay @xmath13-rays .",
    "these should originate from relativistic protons which presumably are also accelerated in cas  a. a summary and the conclusions are contained in section 4 .",
    "in paper 1 we have shown that the basic features of the observed radio emission , in particular ,    \\(a ) spectral turnover of the energy fluxes @xmath14 at frequencies below 20mhz ,    \\(b ) mean spectral index @xmath15 of the total flux at higher frequencies up to @xmath16 ( e.g. baars et al .",
    "1977 ) which then flattens to @xmath17 in the submillimeter domain ( mezger et al . 1986 ) ,    \\(c ) the spread of spectral indices of the radio knots from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ( anderson and rudnick , 1996 ) ,    and other characteristics can be explained in the framework of a model that takes into account the effects of energy dependent propagation of relativistic electrons in a spatially nonuniform remnant .",
    "we have considered the simplest inhomogeneous model , consisting of two zones with essentially different spatial densities of relativistic electrons .",
    "the model allows a rather clear qualitative and quantitative distinction between compact bright radio structures in cas  a like the fragmented radio ring and the radio knots on the one hand , and the remainder of the radio emitting shell  the diffuse radio ` plateau ' region enclosed between the radio ring at @xmath20 and the blast wave at @xmath21 ( for a distance @xmath22 to cas  a , cf .",
    "reed et al .",
    "1995 )  on the other .",
    "the model predicts that the spatial density of relativistic electrons in the compact radio structures , which all together constitute what we termed zone 1 , is much higher than in the surrounding plateau region , termed zone 2 .",
    "thus , zone 1 with a total volume @xmath23 much smaller that the volume @xmath24 of the shell is actually merged into zone 2 with a volume @xmath25 .    in paper 1",
    "we have derived , by spatial integration of the diffusion equation for relativistic electrons , the set of leaky - box type equations for the overall energy distribution functions of the electrons @xmath26 and @xmath27 in zones 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we do not consider the acceleration process itself , but assume that the accelerated electrons are injected into zone 1 with some rate @xmath28 , and study the effects of the energy - dependent diffusive propagation of the particles on their spectra @xmath29 .",
    "such a phenomenological approach is justified if particle acceleration occurs in a volume significantly smaller than the volume where the bulk of the emission of zone 1 is produced .",
    "the equation for zone 1 then reads : @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the energy loss rate of the electrons in zone 1 .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of eq.(1 ) describes the escape of the electrons into the plateau region on timescales @xmath32^{-1}\\ ; .\\ ] ] the term @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a typical radius of the compact radio components and @xmath35 is the fluid speed in zone 1 , corresponds to the convective escape time which does not depend on the electron energy .",
    "the principal energy dependent term in eq.(2 ) is the diffusive escape time : @xmath36 where normalization to a typical energy @xmath37 of radio emitting electrons is used , and @xmath38 takes into account that the escape time can not be shorter than the light travel time .",
    "the third term on the right hand side of eq.(1 ) takes into account that the diffusive propagation and escape of particles is effectively possible only in the directions opposite to the gradients of their spatial density , i.e. from zone 1 with a high concentration of radio electrons into zone 2 . in a standard power - law approximation for the above source function @xmath39",
    "the spectrum of the accelerated electrons can be hard , @xmath40 . however the energy distribution @xmath41 of radio electrons in zone 1 becomes steeper than @xmath42 on the timescale @xmath43 of electron escape from zone 1 into zone 2 .",
    "it is important that , as shown in paper 1 , the degree of steepening at energy @xmath44 essentially depends on the ratio ( or ` the gradient ' ) of the energy densities of the electrons @xmath45 to @xmath46 in these two zones .",
    "the maximum steepening , corresponding to the spectrum @xmath47 with @xmath48 , is reached only if this gradient is very high , and there is _ no steepening at all _ if the energy densities become equal . therefore , although the two - zone model is also rather simplified , as compared with the reality , because it assumes the same electron density for all components in zone 1 , it allows a qualitative explanation for the variations of the power - law indices of individual radio knots from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( anderson & rudnick 1996 ; see also wright et al .",
    "1999 ) assuming an efficient electron acceleration with the same hard power - law spectrum @xmath51 and a diffusive escape time with a parameter @xmath52 .",
    "these variations do not then necessarily imply that particle acceleration significantly varies across the remnant ( wright et al .",
    "1999 ) , but can be explained rather by differences in the local gradients , with respect to the surrounding plateau , of the concentration of radio electrons for different members of zone 1 .    in paper 1",
    "we have shown that a high contrast of electron densities needed for interpretation of the radio observations can be reached if the zone 1 components correspond to the sites of efficient electron acceleration . in principle , the interpretation of the radio data of cas  a does not suggest an efficient acceleration of the electrons in zone 2 .",
    "we note however that such an acceleration , with similarly hard power - law index @xmath53 as in zone 1 , is not excluded , provided that the amount of radio electrons accelerated directly in the plateau region does not significantly exceed the number of electrons leaking into zone 2 from zone 1 .",
    "otherwise the gradients in the spatial densities of electrons would be reduced resulting then in a strong suppression of spectral modifications of @xmath26 in the zone 1 regions .",
    "the equation for the electron distribution @xmath27 in zone 2 is similar to eq.(1 ) , where the source function @xmath54 is substituted by @xmath55 ( taking into account that effectively the escape of relativistic electrons from zone 1 corresponds to their injection into zone 2 , and neglecting possible acceleration in zone 2 ) , and the sign of the term @xmath56 which describes the diffusive escape of electrons from zone 2 into zone 1 is changed .",
    "note that a two - zone model does not assume any other escape of electrons from zone 2 , e.g. into regions outside of the shell , because otherwise such an escape would correspond to a three - zone model ( see sect .",
    "3 below ) .",
    "numerical calculations are done by the method of iterations using general analytical solutions to the leaky - box type equations ( e.g. see atoyan & aharonian 1999 ) . for example , the solution for eq.(1 ) can be presented as @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the variable @xmath59 corresponds to the energy of an electron at instant @xmath60 which has the energy @xmath44 at the instant @xmath61 , and is determined from the equation @xmath62 at the first step of the iteration procedure a function @xmath63 corresponding to the first approximation of @xmath64 is calculated for an injection function @xmath54 in the form of eq.(4 ) , i.e. neglecting the term @xmath65 in @xmath66 , or else - neglecting in eq.(1 ) the term describing the diffusive ` return ' flux of the electrons from zone 2 into zone 1 .",
    "then the energy distribution of the electrons @xmath67 in zone 2 in the first approximation , corresponding to an effective injection function of the electrons in this zone @xmath68 , is found .",
    "after that @xmath67 is used for calculations of @xmath69 in zone 1 in the second approximation , which now takes into account the ` return ' flux of the electrons from zone 2 .",
    "calculations show that such a simple iteration procedure is quickly converging , so typically several iterations are sufficient to reach a good accuracy in the final electron distributions @xmath64 and @xmath70 .",
    "the characteristics of the broad band synchrotron radiation of cas  a can be best explained for the mean magnetic fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 in zones 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the total energy content in relativistic electrons in each of these zones is of order @xmath4 , depending on the magnetic fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the x - ray fluxes observed above @xmath75 can be explained by synchrotron radiation of electrons in zone 1 with an exponential cutoff energy @xmath76 in eq.(4 ) .",
    "a possible fit to the broad band synchrotron fluxes of cas  a is shown in fig.1 .",
    "magnetic fields @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the compact bright radio structures and in the diffuse plateau region , respectively , are assumed .",
    "the total magnetic field energy in the shell is then @xmath79 , and in the compact zone 1 regions it is @xmath80 .",
    "the total energy of electrons in zones 1 and 2 is @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the energy distributions of the electrons @xmath83 and @xmath84 formed in zones 1 and 2 , as well as the overall distribution @xmath85 , are shown in fig.2 . as expected",
    ", @xmath86 shows a pure power - law behavior with @xmath87 until the so - called ` radiative break ' energy @xmath88 . at this energy the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons in zone",
    "2 @xmath89 becomes equal to the age of the source , and at higher energies the radiative losses steepen the spectrum of zone 2 electrons to the power - law index @xmath90 .",
    "meanwhile , at @xmath91 the energy distribution of radio electrons in zone 1 is steepened to @xmath92 because of diffusive escape of the electrons from that zone where their spatial density @xmath93 is much higher than @xmath94 in the surrounding plateau region .      the photon flux @xmath95 of the bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays at energies @xmath96 practically repeats the power - law spectral shape of the parent electrons .",
    "therefore , one might expect that @xmath97 would have the same power - law index @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "however because of the different spectral shapes of the radio electrons in zones 1 and 2 where , most probably , the gas densities are also different , the total bremsstrahlung spectrum of cas  a can somewhat deviate from the power - law behavior of the injection spectrum .    in fig.3",
    "the thin solid line corresponds to the total flux of the bremsstrahlung photons produced by the electrons shown in fig.2 , and the dashed and dot - dashed lines represent the fluxes from zone 1 and zone 2 , respectively . for the calculations we adopt a mean gas density @xmath100 in terms of ` h - atoms ' ( i.e. the nucleons ) in zone 2 .",
    "this corresponds to a total mass of about @xmath101 ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "1980 ; jansen et al . 1988",
    "; vink et al .",
    "1998 ) , in the volume @xmath102 of the shell between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the mean value of the parameter @xmath105 in the oxygen - rich ( @xmath106 ) gas in the shell ( zone 2 ) of cas  a derived by cowsik & sarkar ( 1980 ) is @xmath107 . for zone 1",
    "we assume the same atomic @xmath108 , and the gas density @xmath109 .",
    "we note however that these parameters in the compact radio structures are not known .",
    "in particular , the radio knots show practically no optical line emission which would allow conclusions about the density and mass composition of the gas there .",
    "therefore , for different values of the gas parameters in zone 1 , the relative contribution of zones 1 and 2 to the total bremsstrahlung flux would change . as shown in fig.4 , this results in some uncertainty of the model predictions for the steepness of the total @xmath0-ray fluxes at energies @xmath110 . at both smaller ( @xmath111 ) and higher ( @xmath112 ) energies , where the bremsstrahlung flux is contributed mainly either by the first or by the second zone , the spectral indices are much less affected by the uncertainty in the gas parameters in zone 1 .",
    "because of the steep decline of the energy distribution of radio electrons in the compact zone 1 structures , the intensity of the @xmath0-ray flux at @xmath113 is dominated by the flat - spectrum bremsstrahlung of zone 2 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "it is also important that the contribution of the ic radiation , discussed in detail in the next section , at this energy is not yet significant .",
    "therefore , measurements of the differential flux @xmath97 of high energy @xmath0-rays from cas  a by the future glast detector should allow a rather accurate determinations of a number of important parameters in cas  a. in particular , the spectral index of @xmath97 at gev energies could give rather accurate information about the spectrum of electrons in zone 2 , @xmath114 ( see figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "at these energies the energy distribution of electrons in zone 2 has a power law distribution @xmath115 with the spectral index of accelerated particles , @xmath116 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays with energies @xmath117 are produced by electrons with characteristic energies @xmath118 .",
    "the mean frequency of the synchrotron photons emitted by the same electrons is @xmath119 where @xmath120 ( e.g. ginzburg 1979 ) . in terms of the @xmath0-ray energy",
    "this relation is reduced to @xmath121 for the expected mean magnetic field in the shell of cas  a of about ( 0.30.5)mg ( paper 1 ) , electrons responsible for bremsstrahlung of ( 1 - 2)gev @xmath0-rays are also producing synchrotron photons with @xmath122 few ghz .",
    "thus , a comparison of the radiation intensities in these two regions will give almost model independent information about the mean magnetic field @xmath123 in the shell .",
    "indeed , for the power - law distribution of electrons @xmath124 , the intensity of synchrotron radiation can be written in the form ( see paper 1 ) : @xmath125 where @xmath126 , with @xmath37 , is the characteristic total number of 1gev electrons .",
    "the bremsstrahlung intensity i(e ) ( see e.g. blumenthal and gould 1970 ) can be presented in the form of an energy flux @xmath127 as @xmath128    \\left(\\frac{d}{3.4\\,\\rm kpc}\\right)^{-2 } \\ , \\rm   \\frac{erg}{cm^2 s}\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 , as previously .",
    "then , because the total intensity of @xmath0-rays at ( 1 - 2 ) gev is dominated by the bremsstrahlung of radio electrons in the shell ( zone 2 ) responsible also for the diffuse ` radio plateau ' emission at @xmath130 with the known flux @xmath131 , of the total flux @xmath132 of cas  a was due to plateau emission . taken into account the secular decline of the fluxes , the intensity of diffuse radio emission presently can be estimated as @xmath133 . ] and because the value of @xmath134 in the shell is known with sufficient accuracy , comparison of equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) will result in a rather accurate estimate of the magnetic field @xmath123 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath135 as expected , the mean magnetic field in the shell would be @xmath136^{0.63 } \\left[\\frac{f(1\\,\\rm gev)}{10^{-11}\\,\\rm erg / cm^2 s}\\right]^{-0.63 } \\rm mg\\ ] ] this knowledge of @xmath123 could then help to estimate the mean magnetic field also in compact bright radio structures as @xmath137 which is needed for interpretation of the radio data ( see paper 1 ) .    at energies @xmath138 the overall flux of @xmath0-rays",
    "is dominated by the bremsstrahlung of relativistic electrons in the compact zone 1 region . as follows from eq.(8 ) , the radio counterpart of the @xmath110 @xmath0-rays is the region of frequencies @xmath139 , where the synchrotron radiation is dominated by zone 1 emission ( see fig.1 ) , and the fluxes are not yet affected by synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "although the expected flux sensitivity of the glast detector drops significantly below 100mev , in principle it may be able to detect @xmath0-ray fluxes down to energies @xmath140 ( bloom 1996 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of the flux @xmath97 would help to extract the intensity of 100 mev bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays produced in zone 1 , i.e. in the bright radio ring and radio knots .",
    "then , for known @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) , and @xmath143 in zone 1 ( as predicted in paper 1 ) , the equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) can be used to derive the unknown product @xmath144 there . note that in principle the gas parameters can be different in the radio ring and radio knots . a possibility of separation of the contributions of these two different sub - components of zone 1 to the overall flux",
    "@xmath145 could enable determination of the product @xmath146 in each of them .",
    "important additional information about the gas parameters in compact components could be derived from future observations of cas  a with high angular and energy resolution by the x - ray telescopes chandra , xmm and astro - e in the kev region . even for the case of non - detection of the line features from radio knots , the intensity of their _ thermal _ x - ray emission will help to disentangle the density @xmath147 from the mean abundance @xmath148 . because the intensity of thermal emission @xmath149 , and because for the ionized gas the thermal electron density @xmath150 ( except for a hydrogen - dominated medium where @xmath151 ) , the fluxes of thermal x - rays will in principle allow determination of the parameter @xmath152 in the zone 1 structures . when combined with the knowledge of a different product of parameters @xmath153 and @xmath147 found from the comparison of @xmath0-ray with synchrotron measurements ,",
    "each of these two parameters could be found .",
    "if the fluxes of hard x - rays observed at @xmath154 have a synchrotron origin ( allen et al .",
    "1997 , favata et al . 1997 ;  but see also laming 1998 ) , relativistic electrons in cas  a should be accelerated to energies up to tens of tev .",
    "these electrons should then produce very high energy ( vhe , @xmath12 ) @xmath0-rays .",
    "along with bremsstrahlung , at these energies the principal mechanism for @xmath0-ray production is the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the electrons in the ambient soft photon field . in principle , the photon field is contributed by the synchrotron photons , the thermal dust emission with @xmath155 ( mezger et al .",
    "1986 ) in the far infrared ( fir ) , the optical / ir line photons , and the 2.7k cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "as shown in fig.5 , the most important target photon field for production of ic @xmath0-rays in cas  a is the fir radiation which is responsible for @xmath156 of the ic flux in the vhe region .",
    "note that only due to the high density of the fir radiation in cas  a ( which has not been taken into account in recent calculations by ellison et al .",
    "1999 ) , the flux of ic @xmath0-rays becomes comparable at tev energies with the bremsstrahlung flux . because the photon fields should have practically the same density in both compact and diffuse zones , irrespective of where they are produced , and since the vhe electrons reside mostly in zone 2 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , ic radiation is contributed mostly by this zone . for an assumed mean magnetic field in the shell @xmath157 ( fig.5 ) , the energy density of the magnetic field is @xmath158 , whereas the density of the fir radiation calculated for the luminosity @xmath159 ( mezger et al 1986 ) is only @xmath160 . because the ratio of synchrotron to ic ( in the thomson limit ) emissivities @xmath161 the ic fluxes of vhe @xmath0-rays are @xmath162 times lower than the fluxes of synchrotron radiation produced by the same parent electrons in the uv / x - ray region .",
    "the fluxes of ic @xmath0-rays to be expected from cas  a depend very sensitively on the mean magnetic field @xmath123 in the shell . as follows from eq.(9 ) , an increase of @xmath123 by a factor @xmath163 reduces the total number of electrons needed for explanation of the radio fluxes observed by a factor @xmath164 .",
    "this results in a strong decrease of the bremsstrahlung flux by the same factor , i.e. @xmath165 . the same dependence on the magnetic field also holds for the intensity of ic emission which is produced by the electrons below the radiative break energy ( the ` knee ' around 500 gev in fig.2 ) for which the synchrotron cooling time is larger than the age @xmath166 of the source . for these electrons",
    "the energy distribution @xmath167 repeats the injection spectrum @xmath42 .",
    "however , vhe @xmath0-rays are produced by electrons of higher energies . in that case",
    "the spectrum of electrons is @xmath168 .",
    "then , besides of a less powerful injection rate @xmath169 needed for explanation of the radio fluxes , the spectral intensity of these electrons is additionally suppressed by a factor @xmath170 .",
    "therefore the intensity of vhe radiation depends on the magnetic field in zone 2 as @xmath171 , which is significantly stronger than at gev energies .",
    "this is the result of emission of vhe electrons in the `` saturation '' regime , when all the power injected in tev electrons is channeled into ( mostly ) synchrotron and ic fluxes in the proportion defined by eq.(12 ) .",
    "thus , the flux of ic @xmath0-rays could be significantly increased assuming _ smaller _ values of @xmath123 , and hence also of @xmath172 because the ratio of magnetic fields in two zones should be approximately at the level @xmath173 in order to explain the radio data ( see paper 1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath123 can not be significantly less than 0.3 mg , otherwise the bremsstrahlung flux would then exceed the radiation flux observed at @xmath174 , and the flux upper limit of egret at @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . note that this constraint on the magnetic field in the shell of cas  a imposed by the egret data are model independent since @xmath91 @xmath0-rays are produced by the same electrons with energies @xmath175 which are responsible for the observed radio fluxes . on the other hand ,",
    "the constraints imposed by the hard x - ray fluxes are to some extent conditional , being based on a ( resonable ) assumption that the power - law injection spectrum starts from sub - mev energies .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the constraints for the mean magnetic field in the shell , i.e. @xmath176 , with the constraints imposed in the framework of a spatially homogeneous ( i.e. a single - zone ) model commonly used . because radiative losses can not steepen the spectrum of the radio electrons in cas  a",
    ", both the acceleration spectrum and the overall energy distribution of electrons @xmath177 at gev energies should be steep , with a power - law index @xmath178 for the mean power - law index of the observed radio fluxes @xmath179 .",
    "this is obviously much steeper than the index @xmath180 predicted by the two - zone model . as a result ,",
    "the overall number of electrons predicted in the framework of such single - zone approach at low energies is much higher than for the two - zone model , and hence the lower limit for the mean magnetic field in the shell of cas  a consistent with the x - ray fluxes and upper flux limit increases to @xmath181 ( e.g. ellison et al .",
    "both the steepness of the spectrum and the higher magnetic field predicted in the framework of a single - zone model significantly reduce the fluxes of @xmath0-rays to be expected at very high energies .",
    "note that the impact of the steepness of the acceleration spectrum @xmath42 can be significantly reduced in the framework of a more elaborated model where @xmath42 becomes significantly flatter at higher electron energies , as in calculations by ellison et al .",
    "however , there is no way to reduce the impact of the high mean magnetic field @xmath182 which essentially reduces the number of multi - tev electrons needed for production of a given flux of synchrotron x - rays .",
    "therefore , in the framework of a single - zone model the fluxes of vhe radiation which would _ not contradict _ the observed hard x - ray flux will be significantly lower than the fluxes to be expected in the framework of a spatially inhomogeneous two - zone model ( compare fig .  5 with the results of ellison et al .",
    "1999 , and goret et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for the same values of the mean magnetic fields in zones 1 and 2",
    ", the fluxes of ic @xmath0-rays expected from cas  a at tev energies could be higher than in fig.5 if we consider a more structured model for the magnetic field distribution in the shell than the two - zone model .",
    "namely , we may assume that the magnetic field in the shell of cas  a may decrease from the highest value @xmath172 in the compact zone 1 ( the acceleration sites ) to a lower value @xmath123 in the surrounding zone 2 , and further on to some @xmath183 in zone 3 .",
    "the chain of equations describing the energy distributions of particles in such 3-zone model is easily derived in the same way as described in paper 1 for the 2-zone case .",
    "note that the 3-zone modelling may be more adequate to the radio pattern of cas  a which shows significant variations in the brightness of the diffuse emission of the shell .",
    "zone 3 would then represent the regions of the shell with relatively low magnetic field , as well as possibly the regions adjacent to the shell .",
    "relativistic electrons could then escape from zone 2 into zone 3 , as they do from zone 1 into zone 2 . because the spatial sizes of zone 2 are significantly larger than the sizes of the compact zone 1 structures , the characteristic timescales for the electron escape from zone 2 into zone 3 should be significantly larger than that the escape time from zone 1 into zone 2 .    in fig.6",
    "we show the synchrotron radiation spectra calculated in the framework of the 3-zone model assuming that zones 2 and 3 have approximately the same volume filling factors in the shell .",
    "note that zone 3 may include also regions not contained by the shell , in particular , the volume interior to the reverse shock if the diffusion coefficient there is sufficiently high ( e.g. because of a low magnetic field there ) so that relativistic particles would be able to significantly penetrate upstream of the freely expanding ejecta . in any case , zone 3 gives a principal possibility for high energy electrons to escape from zone 2 into a region with a lower magnetic field , resulting in some steepening of @xmath84 at @xmath184 .",
    "then it becomes possible to assume a power - law injection spectrum of the accelerated particles ( in zone 1 ) harder than @xmath185 , without an excess of the radiation fluxes measured at @xmath186 ( tuffs et al .",
    ", 1997 ) .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the integral fluxes of ic @xmath0-rays , in terms of @xmath187 , calculated in the framework of the 3-zone model , assuming 2 different values for the magnetic field in zone 1 , @xmath188 ( solid line ) and @xmath189 ( dashed line ) , the magnetic field @xmath190 in zone 2 , and @xmath191 in zone 3 .",
    "although @xmath172 and @xmath123 in these 2 cases change only by a factor 1.6 , the fluxes of tev @xmath0-rays drop dramatically , by a factor of 6 - 7 .",
    "note that an assumption of the magnetic field @xmath192 for zone 3 smaller than 0.1 mg does not result in a further increase of tev @xmath0-ray fluxes , because for such low magnetic fields all electrons up to several tev are not in the `` saturation '' regime ( see eq.7 ) , therefore variations of @xmath192 do not affect the electron energy distribution @xmath193 .",
    "it should be noted in connection with the 3-zone model , as compared with the 2-zone model , that it allows an increase of the @xmath0-ray fluxes at energies above 1 tev ( where the ic radiation dominates the overall flux from electrons ) by a factor of 3 assuming the same magnetic fields @xmath172 and @xmath123 for zones 1 and 2 .",
    "because the model parameters in zone 3 ( as the magnetic field @xmath192 , the volume @xmath194 of zone 3 with this low field , and the escape time from zone 2 into zone 3 ) are difficult to deduce from radio observations , this introduces an additional uncertainty in the model predictions for the fluxes of vhe radiation .",
    "however , the mean magnetic fields @xmath123 and @xmath172 can be deduced rather accurately from future @xmath0-ray detections of cas  a at lower energies ( where bremsstrahlung dominates ) as discussed in sect .",
    "then in principle the spectral measurements of vhe @xmath0-ray fluxes could give an important information about the parameters of zone 3 with low magneic field .",
    "the fluxes of tev @xmath0-rays on the level down to few per cent of the crab nebula flux are in principle accessible for a system of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) like the presently operating hegra . in this respect , the recent report of the hegra collaboration ( phlhofer et al .",
    "1999 ) about possible detection , at @xmath195 significance level , of a weak signal from cas  a appears very interesting , and needs a further confirmation .",
    "it should be said that the extraction of a signal from cas  a would require special care , because the fluxes of ic @xmath0-rays are expected to decline already at energies @xmath196 much faster than the flux of the crab nebula , which is generally considered as a `` standard candle '' .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  7 , as well as in fig .  4 where the spectral index of the differential flux is plotted ( to be compared with @xmath197 for the crab nebula ) .",
    "7 we also show the expected range of flux sensitivities of the forthcoming iact arrays .",
    "it predicts that a significant flux of vhe @xmath0-rays should be observed by the future veritas array ( which is to operate in the northern hemisphere ) , if the observed fluxes of hard x - rays above 10kev are indeed of synchrotron origin ( allen et al .",
    "1997 ; favata et al .",
    "detection of the vhe @xmath0-rays would allow a rather robust estimate of the mean magnetic fields @xmath172 and @xmath123 .",
    "this could be done by a modelling , rather than by a direct comparison of the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray fluxes , because they are produced in different zones  in compact zone 1 and the diffuse ` radio plateau ' , respectively .",
    "the tev @xmath0-radiation in cas  a could also be efficiently produced by relativistic protons and nuclei which should be accelerated simultaneously with the electrons .",
    "our study of the spectral and morphological characteristics of the radio emission of cas  a does not favour the blast wave as an efficient accelerator of an electrons competitive with electron acceleration in the compact structures .",
    "however , there are no comparable observational constraints on the proton acceleration sites . in particular , the protons could plausibly be accelerated also at the blast wave .",
    "the standard theory of diffusive shock acceleration suggests that the hadronic component of cosmic rays could be accelerated much more copiously than the electrons , which generally explains the up to two orders of magnitude overabundance of the nucleonic component in the observed galactic cosmic rays .    in fig.7",
    "we show by full dots the @xmath0-ray fluxes resulting from the decay of @xmath2-mesons produced by relativistic protons in the inelastic interactions with surrounding gas in the shell of cas  a. a power - law injection spectrum of relativistic protons in the form of eq.(4 ) , with @xmath198 as for the electrons , is supposed .",
    "for the characteristic maximum energy of accelerated protons we have assumed @xmath199 .",
    "given the very high magnetic field in the acceleration region , @xmath200 , even for a rather young age of cas  a the relativistic protons , not being affected by synchrotron losses like the electrons , can easily reach such high values of @xmath201 . indeed , using an estimate for the standard ` parallel shock ' acceleration efficiency",
    ", the characteristic maximum energy of the protons accelerated during time @xmath166 ( e.g. see lagage & cesarsky , 1983 ) can be written as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is a typical shock speed in cas  a ( in particular , of the reverse shock ) , and @xmath204 is the so called gyrofactor ( the ratio of the mean free path of a particle to its gyroradius ) .",
    "thus , in the case of shock acceleration in the regime close to the bohm diffusion limit , @xmath205 , the protons in cas  a could reach the energy of order 500 tev during an acceleration time as short as @xmath206 .    the total energy of relativistic protons assumed for the calculation of @xmath2-decay @xmath0-ray fluxes in fig .  7 is @xmath207 , which corresponds to the mean injection power of the protons during @xmath208 of about @xmath209 .",
    "on the other hand , for the magnetic field @xmath210 the acceleration power of the electrons is @xmath211 , and @xmath212 for @xmath213 .",
    "thus , the protons are supposed to be accelerated only by a factor of @xmath214 more effectively than the electrons . this ratio can not be increased further by more than a factor of 2 , because otherwise the fluxes of tev @xmath2-decay @xmath0-rays would exceed the flux upper limits shown in fig .",
    ". therefore the ratio of proton to electron acceleration efficiencies in cas  a is significantly smaller than , or else have not yet reached , the high value @xmath215 which is usually supposed for a typical source of the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "it is worth noticing that the upper limit to @xmath216 imposed by the non - detection of tev radiation from cas  a by whipple and cat detectors , is by one order of magnitude lower than the limitation imposed by the flux upper limit of the egret detector ( see fig .",
    "most probably , the total energy in accelerated protons in cas  a can be already now limited by a value not significantly exceeding @xmath217 .",
    "of course , we can not exclude that relativistic protons are accelerated only to energies below the tev range .",
    "this would then imply that the electrons as well are not accelerated to these energies , and therefore that the hard x - ray fluxes detected from cas  a are not of a synchrotron origin ( which can not be still ruled out , see laming 1998 ) .",
    "thus , we expect that rather important conclusions could be derived already from the fact of , hopefully , further confirmation of the possible hegra detection of tev @xmath0-rays cas  a.    for both hadronic and electronic origin of the tev @xmath0-rays , the fluxes are to be produced in the extended shell of cas  a enclosed between angular radii 1.5 and 2.5 arcmin , or perhaps even in a bit larger region , if the vhe electrons would escape from the shell ( this may compose a part of zone 3 , as discussed in previous section ) . in terms of diameter , this makes an appreciable size of order of 5 arcmin .",
    "the iact arrays are able to reconstruct the direction of individual @xmath0-rays with an accuracy of several arcminutes which , in combination with a significant statistics of the @xmath0-rays , may result in a principal possibility to localize relatively strong point sources with an accuracy of about 1 arcmin ( aharonian et al . 1997 ) . therefore iact arrays operating at energies @xmath218 might be able in principle to see some structure ( possible ` hot spots ' ) in the expected generally circular vhe @xmath0-ray image of the source .    in this regard it might be worthwhile to note that radio observations of kassim et al .",
    "( 1995 ) at low frequencies show definite signs of the presence of a substantial mass ( at least several @xmath219 ) of cold gas in the central @xmath220 region of the cas  a. if tev particles would be able to penetrate into that region ( by diffusive propagation upstream of the freely expanding ejecta  in the case of high diffusion coefficient ) , then a central ` hot spot ' would appear , associated with the bremsstrahlung and @xmath2-decay @xmath0-rays produced by tev electrons and protons illuminating the cold unshocked ejecta .",
    "the mean gas density of this ejecta in the central @xmath221 region of cas  a can be estimated as @xmath222 per each solar mass of the ejecta ( to be compared with the mean @xmath223 in the shell ) .",
    "therefore , if the multi - tev particles could really diffuse into that region , so that , say , 5 per cent of the total amount of these particles ( protons and/or electrons ) would be concentrated in that region , and the mass of freely expanding ejecta there could be about @xmath224 , then one could expect that up to @xmath225 of the total flux of vhe @xmath0-rays would come from the centre of cas  a. note that at energies @xmath226 where the sensitivity of iact arrays is very high , most of the @xmath0-ray flux produced by the electrons has a bremsstrahlung origin ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "another possible ` hot spot ' of the ic origin could appear ( at higher energies ) because of the known asymmetric spatial distribution of the target ir photons near the spectral peak around @xmath227 ( see @xmath228 map by dwek et al .",
    "if tev electrons are distributed rather homogeneously in the shell , then the expected overall ic flux would not significantly change .",
    "however the image of cas  a at tev energies will shift towards the position of maximum ir emission in the northern shell . if , on the other hand , the density of tev electrons were enhanced in the northern shell ( where the radio brightness is also enhanced ) then we could expect an enhancement of the overall ic flux as well .",
    "although not yet conclusively detected , @xmath0-rays should inevitably be produced in cas  a by relativistic electrons which are responsible for the synchrotron radiation in the radio to submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "our model calculations predict ( fig .",
    "3 ) that the bremsstrahlung flux of these electrons should be observed at least at energies between 10 mev and 30 gev by the future glast detector .",
    "it is also possible that instruments like integral or astro - e will be able to detect the flux of bremsstrahlung photons at energies @xmath229 ( produced predominantly in the compact radio structures ) from cas  a. in that case one expects to see a profound hardening of the radiation spectrum above 100 kev . but this effect could be detected only if the mean magnetic field @xmath172 would not significantly exceed 1 mg , since otherwise the fluxes of soft @xmath0-rays would fall below the limits of detectability of these instruments .",
    "an important prediction of the spatially inhomogeneous model is that the spectra of accelerated electrons in cas  a correspond to a source function with a rather hard power - law index @xmath1 ( or even slightly harder ) , in agreement with predictions for efficient shock acceleration , and not a value of @xmath230 as presently often assumed on the basis of the mean spectral index of the observed radio fluxes @xmath15 .",
    "this prediction of the model can be directly tested by future detection of the @xmath0-ray fluxes by glast in the energy region around @xmath231 . at these energies",
    "the total flux is dominated by the bremsstrahlung emission of electrons which escape from the compact acceleration regions into the surrounding shell , resulting in a power law distribution of electrons in the shell with an index @xmath232 .",
    "therefore , the spectral shape of the radiation detected at these energies will give direct information on the spectrum of acceleration in cas  a. the intensity of this radiation will give a rather robust estimate of the mean magnetic field @xmath123 in the shell regions responsible for the diffuse ` radio plateau ' emission .",
    "this would allow also a rather good estimate of the mean magnetic field in the compact radio structures , @xmath233 .",
    "very important information on the magnetic field and chemical abundance of the gas in the compact radio structures can be derived by measuring the radiation fluxes at energies below 100mev .",
    "although the expected angular resolution of glast may be insufficient to resolve the radio ring or radio knots , our study shows that most of the flux at these energies should be produced in these compact structures .",
    "therefore , in combination with the known radio fluxes at low frequencies @xmath234 , the @xmath0-ray spectrum of cas  a at energies 10 - 100mev will provide an important information on the product of the gas parameters @xmath235 and @xmath236 in those structures . adding also the information to be expected from the future high angular resolution measurements of the fluxes of thermal x - rays from the compact radio structures , even in the case of absence of line emission features it would be possible to disentangle @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "a synchrotron origin of the x - ray fluxes above 10kev implies acceleration of the electrons beyond 10tev .",
    "if so , we could expect also noticeable fluxes of vhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "these fluxes depend very sensitively on the mean magnetic field @xmath172 in the compact regions of particle acceleration  the bright radio ring which is presumably connected with the reverse shock , and the radio knots  , and the field @xmath123 in the diffuse radio plateau .",
    "the model prediction for these fields ( based on interpretation of synchrotron fluxes only ) corresponds to @xmath239 and @xmath240 . for the case of low magnetic fields , @xmath241 , the integral flux @xmath242 above 1 tev makes about @xmath243 of the crab nebula flux , and about @xmath244 above @xmath245 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum produced by electrons due to bremsstrahlung and ic radiation is rather unusual : it is moderately hard at @xmath246 , with a photon index @xmath247 , and quickly steepens to @xmath248 already at @xmath249 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "an increase of the magnetic field by only a factor of 2 results in a dramatic drop of the tev @xmath0-ray fluxes by one order of magnitude . nevertheless , due to their high flux sensitivity and low detection energy threshold @xmath250 ( aharonian et al .",
    "1997 ) , the iact arrays should be able to detect the fluxes of vhe radiation of cas  a even in the case of high magnetic fields @xmath251 .",
    "the preliminary detection of cas  a by the less sensitive iact system of hegra , reported by phlhofer et al ( 1999 ) , strengthens this expectation .    in this regard ,",
    "it is significant that in cas  a the expected @xmath0-ray fluxes of hadronic origin should readily be distinguished from @xmath0-rays of electronic origin due to the much steeper electronic spectra at energies above a few hundred gev ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the spectral information on the vhe @xmath0-ray flux can be obtained by the future veritas array , and might be also accessible to the hegra iact system ( depending on the magnetic fields @xmath172 and @xmath123 ) for @xmath0-rays of the electronic origin , or if the total energy of relativistic protons in cas  a is not less than @xmath252 . in both cases",
    "the predicted flux above 500 gev is not much less than @xmath253 ` crab ' ( see fig .",
    "note that the current upper flux limits reported by cat ( goret et al .",
    "1999 ) and whipple ( lessard et al . 1999 ) telescopes put an upper limit to the total energy of relativistic protons in cas  a of @xmath254 ( assuming acceleration of protons beyond tev energies ) . a non - detection of @xmath0-ray fluxes in the region above 100gev by future iact arrays would imply that the efficiency of hadron acceleration in cas  a does not exceed the efficiency of electron acceleration ."
