    "it is commonly held that most massive , ob stars are found in stellar clusters , or associations , since their short ( @xmath3 myr ) lifetimes are not long enough to permit spatial dispersion from their natal companions",
    ". however , apparently - isolated , massive field stars are well - known to exist , including a class of runaway ob stars with unusually large ( @xmath4 ) velocities . while runaway ob stars are generally believed to be kinematically ejected from a parent ob association , the ordinary non - runaway field ob stars",
    "have been suggested to originate in a different mode of star formation from their counterparts in associations . suggested differences between clusters and the field in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) for high - mass stars ( massey 2002 ; kroupa & weidner 2003 ) support this possibility .",
    "this contribution explores the relationship between ob associations and massive field stars . in recent years",
    ", it has emerged that the number of stars @xmath0  per cluster appears to follow a universal power law distribution : @xmath5 this has been found empirically for young , massive clusters ( e.g. , hunter et al .",
    "2003 ; zhang & fall 1999 ) , super star clusters ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) , globular clusters ( e.g. , harris & pudritz 1994 ) and  regions ( oey & clarke 1998 ) . the apparent universality of this relation is emerging as fundamental ( e.g. , oey & muoz - tuon 2003 ; oey & clarke 1998 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , similar to the constant power - law relation for the imf .",
    "if individual , field ob stars have a fundamentally different origin from clustered ob stars , then this is likely to be manifest in the distribution of @xmath0 , near @xmath6 , where @xmath0  specifically counts massive stars only ( here , @xmath7 ) . in what follows",
    ", we examine the form of @xmath8 , for small @xmath0 , a regime that has not been investigated to date , to illuminate the relationship between massive star clustering and massive field stars .",
    "a study of ob star clustering properties and field stars requires high spatial resolution and essentially complete detection of the ob stars over a large area of a given galaxy .",
    "the magellanic clouds are optimal target galaxies by virtue of their proximity and high galactic latitude .",
    "indeed , some of the earliest work on ob associations and massive star censuses was carried out for the magellanic clouds by feast et al .",
    "( 1960 ) , sanduleak ( 1969 ) , lucke & hodge ( 1970 ) , azzopardi & vigneau ( 1982 ) , and hodge ( 1985 ) .",
    "more recently , the @xmath9 survey data of massey ( 2002 ) for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , together with uv photometry ( parker et al .",
    "1998 ) from the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) _ , provide unprecedented depth , resolution , completeness , and broadband coverage for the massive star population over a large fraction of the smc .",
    "the area observed by _",
    "uit _ is smaller than the optical survey , but covers the smc bar , which includes most of the active star formation in that galaxy .",
    "figure  [ f_areas ] shows the regions covered by the two surveys .",
    "smc ob associations have previously been identified and catalogued by hodge ( 1985 ) and battinelli ( 1991 ) , the latter from the photographic ob census of azzopardi & vigneau ( 1982 ) . here , we re - examine the clustering properties of these massive stars in the smc , using the modern datasets to first systematically identify ob stars , and then to systematically identify groups or associations of them .",
    "we will especially focus on the statistical properties of the low-@xmath0  regime .",
    "@xcite provide _ uit _ photometry in the b5 filter ( @xmath10 = 1615  , @xmath11 = 225  ) , which recently has been recalibrated by parker , cornett , & stecher ( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the @xmath9 photometry of @xcite was observed through a harris filter set and transformed to the johnson - cousins system ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "reddening - free @xmath12 indices were computed using the extinction law of @xcite with a total to selective extinction ratio @xmath13 = 3.1 .",
    "different combinations of filters were used to best select two different stellar samples : stars with initial masses @xmath14 , corresponding to spectral types of b0 v , b0.5 i and earlier , were selected on the basis of their optical photometry only ; and stars with initial masses @xmath15 , corresponding to spectral types of o9 v , b0 i and earlier were selected on the basis of both their @xmath9 and _ uit _ photometry .",
    "we refer to the former as the ob sample , and the latter as the o - star sample , although we emphasize that neither sample consists of spectroscopically confirmed stars .",
    "our criteria are as follows , using an smc distance modulus dm@xmath16 ( dolphin et al .",
    "2001 ) and global average extinction @xmath17 : @xmath18    where @xmath19 the ob sample is selected from equations  [ eq_ocritfirst ] and [ eq_ocritsecond ] only , while the o - star sub - sample meets all of equations  [ eq_ocritfirst ] to [ eq_ocritlast ] .",
    "table  [ tab_ostarlist ] shows all the stars having both @xmath20 b5 photometry , @xmath9 photometry , and spectral classifications listed by massey ( 2002 ) , excluding stars with objective prism classifications and those identified as uncertain spectral types .",
    "the i d number and classification from massey ( 2002 ) are shown in columns 1 and 2 .",
    "column 3 shows whether the star met the o - star selection criteria above .",
    "our attempts to select only stars earlier than o9 v and b0 i were successful for 27 out of 31 stars ; of the 4 not selected , one had nebular emission affecting the photometry and two others had weak metal lines ( designation w in spectral type ) .",
    "the false positives were 8 out 26 stars ; the majority of the false positives were weak lined stars ( w ) , emission line stars , and peculiar stars .",

    "having identified two samples of 1360 ob and 382 o stars , we then used the friends - of - friends algorithm described by battinelli ( 1991 ) to identify the associations of these stars .",

    "note that these group identifications represent the results from two separate runs of the group - finding algorithm ; thus , if a star belongs to both samples , it may belong to groups in both table  [ t_4 ] and table  [ t_5 ] .",
    "figure  [ f_grouppos ] shows the location of the group centroids compared to those of associations identified by hodge ( 1985 ; solid black circles ) and battinelli ( 1991 ; dashed black circles ) .",
    "our ob and o - star groups are indicated by the solid blue and red circles , respectively .",
    "the circle sizes correspond to the mean diameters @xmath30 from tables  [ t_obgrpctrs ] and [ t_ogrpctrs ] . for the hodge objects ,",
    "the diameters are taken to be the mean of the dimensions in ra and dec given by hodge ( 1985 ) .",
    "there is good general correspondence between the positions of our groups and these earlier catalogs ; certainly at least as good as the correspondence between the hodge ( 1985 ) and battinelli ( 1991 ) identifications .",
    "it is apparent that the net tendency from our smaller @xmath21 is for our associations to be smaller than those in the earlier catalogs , and to break up some of those associations into smaller groups .",
    "figures  [ f_sizedistr]@xmath34 and [ f_sizedistr]@xmath35 show the size distributions for , respectively , the ob and o - star samples .",
    "it is apparent that , aside from individual stars , the peak in the distribution is around 1015 pc , compared to 50 pc for both the battinelli ( 1991 ) and hodge ( 1985 ) catalogs .",
    "whereas hodge ( 1985 ) reports that the mean diameter of his sample is similar to the mean for the lmc sample , our smaller characteristic value is consistent with the lower luminosities of the smc  regions and star - forming regions compared to those of the lmc ( e.g. , kennicutt , edgar , & hodge 1989 ) .",
    "figure  [ f_nstar ] shows the distribution in @xmath0  for the ob groups ( panel @xmath24 ) and o - star groups ( panel @xmath25 ) .",
    "two slopes are shown fitted to the power - law distribution , weighted by the square root of the bin value , @xmath36 : the solid line shows the fit for the entire distribution , yielding @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the ob and o - star samples , respectively ; and the dotted line shows the fit omitting the first bin , which corresponds to single stars , resulting in fits of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the ob and o - star samples , respectively .",
    "the fits omitting the single stars agree with the power - law slope of 2 ( equation  [ eq_n * ] ) , found for the @xmath0  distribution in a variety of systems , as discussed in  1 .",
    "we again emphasize , as mentioned above , that the fitted slope has a dependence on the clustering distance @xmath21 : for large @xmath21 , more stars are drawn into the associations , causing the resultant slope of the clustering law to be flatter relative to clustering defined by a small @xmath21 .",
    "since we seek a characteristic value for the slope of @xmath8 , it is important to ensure that @xmath21 is in turn characteristic of the sample . for the @xmath21 in the extreme range of 20  40 pc ( see figure  [ f_ds]@xmath25 ) , the o - star sample shows a variation in fitted slope , omitting the field stars , of @xmath41 to @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that the single stars are slightly greater in number than the power law for the remainder of the @xmath0  distribution , particularly in the ob sample .",
    "how significant is this excess in the isolated , `` field '' stars ?",
    "we note that the magnitude of the excess may be a lower limit , since the slope of the @xmath0  distribution is expected to flatten slightly at the smallest values of @xmath0 , owing to statistical effects , as follows .",
    "we assume , as suggested above , that the ob stars counted in the value of @xmath0  represent only the most massive stars for a population of star clusters that are in reality populated by a mass distribution described by a conventional imf .",
    "since we identified only ob stars , our clusters are selected with the criterion that each cluster contains a star of at least mass @xmath43 .",
    "the smallest , `` unsaturated '' clusters have a lower probability of having their maximum stellar mass @xmath44 , so they will be progressively missing from a sample of clusters selected in this way ( see oey & clarke 2003 for a detailed discussion of this effect ) .",
    "figure  [ f_cuteff ] shows monte carlo models that demonstrate this effect .",
    "@xmath0  is drawn from a power - law distribution of slope 2 ( equation  [ eq_n * ] ) , with the individual stellar masses drawn from a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf having @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ f_cuteff]@xmath24 shows the distribution in @xmath0  for 10,000 clusters having at least one star with mass @xmath46 , and figure  [ f_cuteff]@xmath25 is the same , but selected for @xmath47 .",
    "we see a flattening in the distributions for small @xmath0 , and the flattening is stronger in figure  [ f_cuteff]@xmath25 , since the probability of drawing a @xmath48 star is less than for a @xmath49 star .",
    "figure  [ f_singlebkg ] shows the stellar density of all catalogued stars in the @xmath9 survey as a function of radius around the isolated , field massive stars found in the ob ( solid line ) and o - star ( dashed line ) samples .",
    "the errors are computed as @xmath50 for the total @xmath51 stars within radius @xmath52 , omitting the central field massive stars . as seen in figure  [ f_singlebkg ]",
    ", it is apparent that the stellar density increases at small @xmath52 .",
    "this is consistent with our suggestion that most massive field stars represent the most massive component of groups of smaller stars , as is expected from the stellar imf .",
    "another effect that can offset the statistical flattening in the form of the @xmath0  distribution for small @xmath0 , is evolution . in the most extreme situation",
    ", we consider that all the ob associations in the smc were formed together in a single burst of global star formation .",
    "staveley - smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that the  shells identified in the smc appear to have a narrow age distribution around 5  myr .",
    "we described above that the unsaturated , lowest-@xmath0clusters have a lower average stellar mass ( e.g. , oey & clarke 2003 ) .",
    "since stellar lifetimes are longer for lower - mass stars , we therefore expect that these unsaturated clusters will tend to last longer , on average , than the statistically fully - sampled , or saturated , objects .",
    "thus , we may expect that the distribution in @xmath0  steepens with time .",
    "we constructed monte carlo simulations of such an aging burst of clusters .",
    "figure  [ f_burst ] shows the models for a population of clusters at 0 , 15 , and 25 myr after their simultaneous formation .",
    "we used the same imf parameters are before , and the stellar ages are from the grid of charbonnel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for smc metallicity .",
    "each of the model @xmath0  distributions is fitted with a power - law slope , shown in figure  [ f_burst ] .",
    "we see that , while it is difficult to discern the slope steepening over the entire sample after 15 myr , and even at 25 myr , it is apparent that the aging effect is most pronounced in the smallest @xmath0 bins , and that the @xmath0=@xmath53 bin becomes the most disproportionately enhanced . for continuous creation of the clusters",
    ", the net observed slope will be intermediate between the forms in figure  [ f_cuteff ] and figure  [ f_burst ] .",
    "the modest observed excess of single stars is also likely to be caused in part by a contribution to their population by runaway ob stars . if runaway ob stars originate in associations , however , then this contribution must be small , since runaways correspond to about 3% and 20% of field early b and early o stars , respectively ( blaauw 1961 ) .",
    "runaways will contribute primarily to the single - star population , while binary runaways represent @xmath54% of all runaways ( gies 1987 ) .",
    "binary runaways are likely to be tight pairs that remain unresolved in the 0.67 pc px@xmath55 survey resolution .",
    "it is also possible that spurious selection of candidate stars , owing to the coarse photometric criteria , are a factor .",
    "we showed in  2 that there may be a net of about 15% of the o - star sample that consist of spuriously selected b stars ; while in principle , these should be distributed proportionately between clusters and the field , it is possible that crowding effects in clusters favor field selection .",
    "if so , owing to the longer lifetimes of b stars , they could contribute disproportionately to the field star population . however , we emphasize that this requires a significant variation in the spatial distribution of only the spurious candidates , between field and clusters .",
    "the most important factor in enhancing the field star population , however , is probably the strong variation in star formation density across the smc .",
    "the highest star formation density occurs in the smc bar , where , as seen in figure  [ f_grouppos ] , most of the associations are located .",
    "individual massive field stars , on the other hand , have a much more uniform distribution , as seen in figure  [ f_fieldpos ]",
    ". the uneven star formation density distribution in this galaxy therefore favors the field stars and enhances the @xmath0@xmath2 bin for the ob sample in figure  [ f_nstar ] .",
    "the effect is much less pronounced in the o - star sample , which is limited to the smc bar region .",
    "considering these effects , it is apparent that there is no strong variation or change in character of the power - law distribution seen in figure  [ f_nstar ] for the smallest values of @xmath0 .",
    "the empirical samples ( figure  [ f_nstar ] ) are much smaller than those in the models and therefore have significantly poorer statistics in @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the modeled effects will be more difficult to discern in the data .",
    "since our results are largely consistent with a single intrinsic power - law form for the clustering law , this suggests that the massive field star population simply represents an extension of the massive cluster population extending down to @xmath6 .",
    "there is no evidence that the majority of massive field stars originate from a mode of star formation that is different from those in associations .",
    "however , further studies of massive field and cluster populations in other environments are necessary to confirm the generality of these results .",
    "for a universal imf , the constant slope of the @xmath0  distribution extending to the field stars has profound consequences for their global feedback influence in galaxies .",
    "we can now quantify the assertion that most massive stars form in associations : for an @xmath0  distribution given by equation  [ eq_n * ] , the total number of ob stars is , @xmath57 where @xmath58 refers to the upper - limit , maximum cluster of stars .",
    "equation  [ eq_n*sum ] corresponds to a divergent harmonic series which can be approximated for large @xmath58 as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "thus the fraction of @xmath0@xmath2 field stars is @xmath61 of the total @xmath62 . for our ob and o star samples ,",
    "respectively , @xmath63 and 1.8 , yielding 19% and 21% fractions for the field stars .    counting the actual stars in our ob and o star samples , we find that 374 and 91 candidates , respectively , had no massive companions within the clustering radius . these correspond to 28% and 24% , reflecting",
    "the excess found above .",
    "these fractions are about a factor two lower than the finding by parker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that over half of their _ uit_-selected candidate o stars are outside catalogued association boundaries in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . the results for both the smc and lmc may be odds with the results of massey et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who found a much steeper imf slope for field vs cluster massive stars : a steeper imf slope in the field would be manifested as a smaller number of field ob stars , yet the slope of the @xmath0  distribution tends to be steeper than expected , rather than flatter .",
    "if the field star imf is indeed steeper than in clusters , then the clustering law must also steepen substantially for the smallest clusters , in such a way as to compensate for a steep imf in our data .",
    "further investigation is necessary to resolve this issue .    in the meantime ,",
    "the data appear to be broadly consistent with the simpler scenario of , _ simultaneously _ , a universal imf and universal clustering law given by equation  [ eq_n * ] .",
    "as emphasized by mckee & williams ( 1997 ) , the total ob star population , and thus the fraction of isolated field massive stars , is driven by @xmath58 with an inverse logarithmic dependence . for maximum @xmath58 ranging between 10 and @xmath64 , equation  [ eq_n*sumsoln ] yields a fraction of field ob stars ranging from 35% to 7% , respectively .",
    "the clustering law in equation  [ eq_n * ] has important consequences for feedback , implying that the interstellar porosity caused by the formation of superbubbles and supernova remnants has equal relative contributions from objects of all sizes ( oey & clarke 1997 ) . and , since the strmgren volume @xmath65",
    ", it also implies that a strong majority of the field massive stars likely contribute to ionizing the diffuse , warm ionized medium , which constitutes about 40% of the total h@xmath66  luminosity in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , walterbos 1998 ) .",
    "our result is quantitatively consistent with the result of hoopes & walterbos ( 2000 ) that field ob stars can power 40% @xmath67 12% of the warm ionized medium in m33 , where the fraction of field ob stars is likely around 15% .",
    "we find no evidence that the field massive stars in the smc are formed by a fundamentally different star - forming process .",
    "rather , we find that the continuous power - law distribution in @xmath0down to @xmath0@xmath2 strongly suggests that the star - forming process is continuous from rich clusters to poor groups , apparently for all ensembles that form ob stars .",
    "the data are consistent with the model that single , field ob stars are usually the most massive member of a group of smaller stars , as expected from the universal @xmath0distribution ( equation  [ eq_n * ] ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the _ simultaneous _ existence of a universal imf and universal @xmath1 clustering law .",
    "these joint universal power laws imply that field ob stars constitute roughly 35% to 7% of the total massive star population , with an inverse logarithmic dependence on @xmath58 of the the most populous cluster .",
    "thus , the fraction is dependent on galaxy size and/or star formation rate .",
    "the contribution of these field stars to the ionized volume in the warm ionized medium is likely to scale according to their relative fraction .",
    "the universal clustering law also implies equal relative contributions by superbubbles of all sizes to the interstellar porosity .",
