    "we consider a table consisting of a polygon @xmath0 ( not necessarily rational ) with several one - sided mirrors inside ; i.e.  a straight line segments connection pairs of points in @xmath1 , each of which has two sides , a transparent side and a reflecting side .",
    "the billiard is defined as follows .",
    "consider a point particle and a direction @xmath2 ; the point moves in the direction @xmath3 with a unit speed up to the moment when it reaches the boundary , if it arrives at a transparent side of a mirror it passes through it unperturbed , while if it arrives at a reflecting side of a mirror or at the boundary of @xmath1 it is reflected with the usual law of geometric optics , the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection .",
    "polygonal billiards with one - sided mirrors were described for the first time by m.  boshernitzan and i.  kornfeld in @xcite , in this article one - sided mirrors were called spy mirrors . however , they considered the less general case of rational polygons with the mirrors that form rational angles with the sides of polygonal table .",
    "such tables give rise to interval translation maps , a generalization of interval exchange maps .",
    "in contrast of interval exchange transformations , interval translation maps are poorly understood , only a few results are known ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a particular example of a rational billiard with one - sided mirrors , the square with a vertical one - sided mirror with one end point on the bottom side of the square , was studied in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will prove two types of results . in the setting of an arbitrary polygon with one - sided mirrors",
    "we show that the topological entropy of our system is zero . in certain more restricted settings",
    "we show that we have sub exponential or polynomial growth estimates .",
    "the next two subsections describe these results in more detail .",
    "we prove that the polygonal billiard with one - sided mirrors has zero topological entropy .",
    "to do this we first consider the inverse limit space of a polygonal billiard with one - sided mirrors and show that it has zero topological entropy ( an exact statement is provided below ) .",
    "we show that the inverse limit space in our case is closely related with the attractor ( the notion of the attractor of the billiard map was introduced in @xcite ) and that the attractor has zero topological entropy .",
    "then we extend the zero entropy result to the full phase space .",
    "there exist several different proofs of zero topological entropy for polygonal billiards without one - sided mirrors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our proof mainly uses some ideas from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main difference with the situation of classical billiards is the non - invertibility of our system .",
    "also , j. buzzi in @xcite showed a closely related result that piecewise isometries in any dimension are of zero entropy . for rational polygonal billiards with rational one - sided spy mirrors , zero topological entropy is a corollary from the fact that the directional complexity is at most polynomial @xcite , and the variational principle .    throughout the article the term _",

    "let @xmath137 denote the torus ( @xmath262 ) obtained by unfolding the square with the one - sided mirrors identified as in the figure [ sq ] .",
    "now we construct an explicit universal cover of @xmath137 , first we unfold the square to a torus and then take the universal cover of the torus by the plane .",
    "next we identify the one - sided mirrors at @xmath263 with the one - sided mirror at @xmath264 , i.e.   all jumps are to the right and of the form @xmath265 ( see figure [ cover ] ) .",
    "( -129,195)(0,-1)35 ( -160,200 ) ( -103,205)(0,-1)45 ( -120,210 )    now consider the generalized diagonals starting at the origin which arrives at the point @xmath266 ( @xmath267 and @xmath268 ) which do not pass through any other vertex in - between .",
    "label the squares traversed by the generalized diagonals by the coordinates of their bottom left corners . by the explicit construction of our universal cover , when the generalized diagonal is in the square with bottom left corner @xmath269 then either we cross a horizontal side and are in square @xmath270 or we cross a spy mirror , or a vertical side and are in square @xmath271 .",
    "thus we cross @xmath21 horizontal sides @xmath272 , @xmath195 vertical sides and @xmath87 vertical mirrors with @xmath273 .",
    "we conclude that the combinatorial length of any such generalized diagonal is @xmath274 .",
    "we want to estimate how many such generalized diagonals we can have .",
    "clearly there is at most one which hits no spy mirrors , it is the line segment of slope @xmath275 starting at the origin and ending at @xmath266 , and it is a generalized diagonal if and only if this segment does not reflect form any spy mirrors .",
    "now we claim that , for each @xmath276 there is at most one generalized diagonal connecting @xmath277 to @xmath266 which hits exactly @xmath278 spy mirrors .",
    "in fact , the slope of such a generalized diagonal must be @xmath279 , and then if we start an orbit segment at the origin with this slope it is a generalized diagonal ( arrives at @xmath266 ) if and only if it hits exactly @xmath278 spy mirrors",
    ".    thus there are at most @xmath280 generalized diagonals connecting @xmath277 to @xmath266 , all other cases of pairs of vertices are similar .",
    "there are @xmath281 lattice points and ends of spy mirrors at a distance @xmath282 of the origin , yielding a cubic estimate for the number of generalized diagonals and thus a quintic estimate on the complexity by theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "now consider the general case .",
    "let @xmath283 , @xmath284 be the @xmath12 coordinates of the finite collection of vertical mirrors ( there can be several mirrors with the same @xmath12 coordinate ) .",
    "the reflecting sides of the mirrors are not necessarily the same .",
    "the universal cover identifies the copy of each mirror in @xmath285 with the associated one - sided mirror at @xmath286 for mirrors with the reflecting side of the left say , and if the right side is reflecting then @xmath287 with the associated mirror at @xmath288 . as we trace a trajectory it always jumps to the right , by @xmath289 in the first case , and @xmath290 in the second case .",
    "consider the generalized diagonal connecting @xmath277 to @xmath266 .",
    "let @xmath291 denote the total number spy mirrors with @xmath12-coordinate @xmath292 which the generalize diagonal hits , and @xmath293 denote the number of vertical sides it crosses .",
    "for each @xmath294 it hits exactly one spy mirror or one vertical mirror in each rectangle @xmath295 , thus @xmath296 ( note that it can not hit a vertical mirror in the rectangle @xmath297 and arrive at the point @xmath266 and by definition it arrives , but does not cross the side @xmath298 ) . furthermore the total horizontal distance travelled by the generalized diagonal is @xmath299 . since the vertical distance it travelled is @xmath280 it has slope @xmath300 .",
    "we claim by induction that the number @xmath301 of integer solutions of with each @xmath291 satisfies @xmath302 for all @xmath303 . for @xmath304 equality",
    "holds , this was used above .",
    "suppose that this is true for some fixed @xmath49 . to estimate @xmath305",
    "suppose that @xmath306 , then @xmath307 which has @xmath308 solutions .",
    "thus @xmath309 .    as above we have shown that for each choice of the set @xmath310 we have at most one generalized diagonal connecting the origin to @xmath266 .",
    "thus there are at most @xmath311 generalized diagonals connecting @xmath277 to @xmath266 , all other cases of pairs of vertices are similar .",
    "again there are at most @xmath312 lattice points and ends of spy mirrors at a distance of at most @xmath282 from the origin , yielding at most @xmath313 generalized diagonals of length @xmath282 and thus the complexity is at most @xmath314 by theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "remark , we actually prove a slightly stronger theorem    suppose that @xmath1 is the square with a finite number of vertical spy mirrors cottoned in @xmath49 vertical lines .",
    "then the total complexity satisfies @xmath315 for all @xmath21 .",
