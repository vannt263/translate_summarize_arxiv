    "understanding the properties of non - equilibrium systems has been a central effort of the scientific community for many years . of specific interest are non - equilibrium processes that take place at the nano - meter scale and at which energy is converted from one form to another , for instance photovoltaic ( pv ) energy conversion , photochemistry and photosynthesis . in these cases , the interaction between electrons and photons under non - equilibrium conditions plays an essential role .",
    "theoretical modeling of such processes is a challenging task , since the interacting nature of the system and its many - body characteristics , the multitude of constituents , the presence of external environments , and the non - equilibrium conditions must all be taken into consideration .    even harder to address theoretically are situations in which the system has two independent fluxes , originating from separate non - equilibrium drivings , and are both far away from the linear response regime ,",
    "a situation which is designated as _ strong non - equilibrium_. a paradigmatic example for such a system are photo - voltaic cells , where the two fluxes are the heat flux , originating from the huge temperature difference between the sun and the earth , and the particle current originating from the voltage difference between the electrodes . in recent years",
    "a new and exciting class of photo - voltaic cells has emerged , namely molecular photo - cells , where the energy conversion process takes place at the single molecule level @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a formalism to study non - equilibrium transport in molecular junctions , and use it to investigate a model for the molecular photo - cell , a single molecular donor - acceptor complex attached to electrodes and subject to external illumination .",
    "this model was recently suggested @xcite to be the minimal model to describe pv energy conversion in ideal , single - molecule heterojunction organic pv cells . in ref .",
    "@xcite pv conversion efficiency was analyzed using the ( essentially classical ) rate equations for the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics and non - equilibrium properties of the phonons and photons were ignored , being considered only within a ( non - self - consistent ) mean - field approximation and assumed to have equilibrium distributions . here",
    "we show the non - equilibrium properties of the phonons and photons have a strong impact on the pv conversion properties in realistic parameter range and can not be neglected .",
    "the formalism we present here allows us to treat electrons , photons and phonons fully quantum mechanically and on an equal footing ( without resorting to a mean - field approximation ) and to take into account the action of the environments producing a strong non - equilibrium situation .",
    "we use the many - body lindblad quantum master equation @xcite to describe the environments , which consist of metallic electrodes in touch with a molecular complex , a phonon bath ( at ambient temperature ) and a photon bath ( at the solar temperature ) .",
    "non - equilibrium is induced by two sources , namely the temperature difference between the incoming photons ( originating from the sun ) and the device , and the voltage bias between the electrodes .    using this formalism",
    ", we calculate the non - equilibrium densities of electrons , photons and phonons , the electric current and power output , and the thermodynamic efficiency at maximal power .",
    "we find that under certain conditions , the distribution functions for the phonons and photons can be very different from the equilibrium distributions , and therefore approximating the system as close to equilibrium is not a valid approximation .",
    "we then study the signature of non - equilibrium on the energy conversion efficiency of the system .",
    "in addition to be able to include strong non - equilibrium effects and to account for all constituents on equal footing , our formalism allows one to introduce effects of dephasing and decoherence in a simple and physically transparent way .",
    "we study how the loss of quantum coherence affects the efficiency , and show that classical electron transfer ( as opposed to coherent electron propagation ) _ enhances _ the efficiency .",
    "the system under consideration is composed of a molecular junction , in which a donor - acceptor ( d - a ) complex is placed between two metallic electrodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this is an idealization of an envisioned future single - layer molecular photovoltaic cells , where a self - assembled layer of d - a pairs is placed on a conducting substrate , and is covered by a top transparent electrode . for the donor ( d ) , we consider the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) with energy @xmath1 and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) with energy @xmath2 .",
    "for the acceptor ( a ) , we consider only the lumo with energy @xmath3 ( the energy of the a s homo is much lower and is unaffected by any dynamics in the photocell @xcite ) .",
    "recent advances in the experimental ability to measure photo - conductivity and pv conversion in single - molecule junctions @xcite make our theoretical model experimentally relevant .",
    "0.5truecm     we begin by examining the electron , photon and phonon densities at zero bias voltage .",
    "note that the system is still out of equilibrium due to the temperature difference between the photon and phonon baths . in fig .",

    "we set the orbital energies to be @xmath9 ev , @xmath10ev , and @xmath11ev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 interaction is fixed at @xmath13 ev ( dashed vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "three distinct regimes are observed : ( i ) at small @xmath7 coupling , @xmath14 , the system is close to equilibrium , and the photon occupation is defined by the solar temperature @xmath15 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the phonons are excited according to the ambient temperature ( which is very small compared to @xmath16 , and consequently the phonon occupation is very small ) , and the occupation of the d - lumo level is also very small .",
    "( ii ) as the @xmath7 and @xmath12 interactions become comparable , energy is transferred from the photons to the phonons , mediated by excitation of electrons from the d - homo to the d - lumo level . as a result , the d - lumo and phonon occupations increase , while the photon occupation decreases .",
    "alternatively , this situation can be described in terms of heating ( although the notion of temperature is not applicable out of equilibrium , it is still useful to think in terms of an effective temperature ) : the junction is locally ( and efficiently ) heated by the photons .",
    "this heat is transferred to the phonons , resulting in an elevated effective phonon temperature and , consequently , enhanced phonon occupation .",
    "( iii ) when @xmath7 coupling is large , @xmath17 , there is no longer efficient transfer of heat to the phonons .",

    "the output power is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath20 is the particle current through the system , and the input power is calculated in a similar way @xcite from @xmath26 , which is related to the photon - induced part of the particle current .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , a typical @xmath27 curve has a maximal power . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , @xmath19 at the maximal power is plotted as a function of the @xmath7 coupling ( we use the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "for very small @xmath7 coupling ( @xmath280.002 ev ) , the efficiency is very small , and grows linearly with @xmath8 . in this regime ,",
    "the time it takes for an electron to absorb a photon is larger than the time the photons spent in the cell ( defined by @xmath29 ( which translates to @xmath30 ev ) , and so the photon absorption is very small leading to poor efficiency .",
    "this regime is followed by a plateau regime , where any energy transfered from the photons to the electrons is quickly dissipated by phonons and is not converted into electrical power .",
    "there is thus little change in the efficiency , as long as the rate of photon absorption is smaller than the eletron - photon - relaxation time .",
    "only when the @xmath7 coupling reaches the @xmath12 coupling @xmath13 ev the efficiency begins to increase : in this regime , energy is transferred to the electrons by the photons faster than can be dissipated by the phonons , and as a result an increasing amount of this energy is transferred into electronic power , resulting in a rise of efficiency .",
    "it is important to note that the results described in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , especially in the region where the electron - phonon and electron - photon couplings are of the same order , _ can not be obtained by assuming equilibrium distributions for the phonons and photons _ , and this situation is described here for the first time . since in future realistic devices the strength of the electron - photon and electron - phonon interactions are unknown , a situation where they are of similar magnitude may occur , in which case the system dynamics can not be described as close to equilibrium , and the full non - equilibrium dynamics need to be taken into account . to further demonstrate the power of this method , we next discuss the effect of coulomb interactions on the efficiency . in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] , the a - lumo energy , @xmath31 , already includes the coulomb repulsion energy on the acceptor @xcite . in excitonic systems ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is typically considered through the `` exciton binding energy '' , defined by the coulomb interaction term @xmath32 between an electron at the d - lumo and a hole in the d - homo . while in methods such as non - equilibrium green s function adding coulomb interaction requires substantial effort , the present method does not require either additional technical complexity or additional computational power to account for any coulomb interaction effects . in fig .",

    "the next question we wish to address is the extent to which the quantum nature of the system affects the pv conversion efficiency , a question which is beyond the reach of the formalism presented in refs .",
    "the formalism we present here allows us to access , in addition to fully quantum - coherent processes described above , also incoherent processes .",
    "the most important incoherent processes are electron transfer from the d - lumo to the a - lumo , described classically in ref .",
    "these are addressed here by adding an additional pair of @xmath39operators that accounts for incoherent transitions , namely @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the pair of parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 describe the strength of the coherent and incoherent donor - acceptor electron transfer processes , respectively .    in what was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the d- and a- lumo levels were connected by quantum - mechanical bonding .",
    "in contrast , ref .",
    "@xcite accounted for the electronic transfer between the d- and a- lumo levels by an incoherent ( or classical ) transfer process .",
    "it is thus of interest to interpolate between the fully quantum case ( @xmath44 ) , through the mixed quantum - classical case ( @xmath45 ) , to the fully classical case ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "to do so , we define a variable @xmath47 such that @xmath48 , and define @xmath49 ev and @xmath50 ( as in ref .",
    "we now parametrize @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath47 , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the heaviside unit step - function ) .",
    "this parametrization is shown on the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , and is constructed such that for @xmath53 the system is fully coherent , for @xmath54 the system is mixed ( both quantum and classical processes ) , and for @xmath55 the system is fully incoherent , so the range @xmath56 interpolates between all three cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the efficiency at maximum power @xmath19 as a function of the position of the a - lumo , @xmath57 and the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "we set @xmath58 as in ref .",
    "we find that the quantum coherence or classical decoherence ( parametrized by @xmath47 ) has a profound effect on the efficiency of the molecular pv - cell in two important aspects .",
    "first , the optimal position of the a - lumo energy differs according to the nature of the transition under consideration : quantum ( coherent ) , both quantum and classical , or classical d - a transitions ( solid lines in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . for the last case ( @xmath59 ) , we find that @xmath31 is optimal at @xmath60 ev , verifying the result of ref .  @xcite . when quantum correlations are added ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "two peaks emerge at @xmath62 ev , and a lower peak emerges at @xmath63 ev . for a system with only quantum transitions ( @xmath64 , enlarged in the back inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the lower peak vanishes , and the optimal lumo positions are at @xmath65 ev and @xmath66 ev .",
    "thus , in the design of optimal molecular pv cells , it is important to take into account the quantum nature .",
    "second , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the addition of classical d - a transitions _ increases _ the efficiency substantially by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this finding is surprising , since one would expect that incoherent ( and dissipative ) transitions would lead to a decrease in the efficiency .",
    "to understand the origin of this effect , we performed time - dependent calculations ( not shown ) and found that for the coherent case , an electron that is excited to the d - lumo coherently oscillates between the d- and a - lumo , while for the incoherent case the electron decays from the d- to the a - lumo exponentially ( and its return rate is exponentially small ) .",
    "this implies that in the coherent case the electron spends much more time in the d - lumo than in the incoherent case , before transferring to the right electrode .",
    "since the electron can decay back to the d - homo ( emitting a phonon ) only directly from the d - lumo , the longer it spends on the d - lumo , the higher the probability for non - radiative decay back to the d - homo , leading to a decrease in efficiency .",
    "this phenomena is similar to dephasing - assisted transport conjectured to occur in biological systems , @xcite but here is the first time it is discussed and demonstrated in the context of molecular pv cells . since in realistic single - molecule",
    "both coherent and incoherent effects may be important , they must be included in a theoretical description of the system .",

    "<S> the molecular photo - cell is of interest being a paradigmatic example for a system that inherently operates in out - of - equilibrium conditions and typically far from the linear response regime . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this system includes electrons , phonons and photons , and environments which induce coherent and incoherent processes , making it a challenging system to address theoretically . here , using an open quantum systems approach , we analyze the non - equilibrium transport properties and energy conversion performance of a molecular photo - cell , including for the first time both coherent and incoherent processes and treating electrons , photons , and phonons on an equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the non - equilibrium conditions and decoherence play a crucial role in determining the performance of the photovoltaic conversion and the optimal energy configuration of the molecular system . </S>",
