    "<S> bound states were also excited and their ( doppler shifted ) de - excitation @xmath5-rays were measured . </S>",
    "<S> a large deformation of the neutron - rich nucleus @xmath6 mg was recently deduced from a measurement of the @xmath7 885  kev transition to the ground state after medium energy electromagnetic excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 320  kev @xmath8 @xmath5-transition in @xmath0be was recently observed . </S>",
    "<S> the measured cross - section for the @xmath0be ( @xmath9 ) coulomb excitation was found to be noticeably less than expected from the known lifetime and @xmath10 order pure coulomb excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from possible nuclear and coulomb - nuclear interference effects , a possible reason for this discrepancy is the influence of higher order electromagnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is the purpose of this letter to describe a framework suitable for fast projectiles . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. the rather loosely bound @xmath0be in its @xmath10 excited @xmath11 state could easily be excited electromagnetically into the continuum in a second step @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> electromagnetic excitation is mainly characterized by two parameters , the adiabaticity parameter @xmath12 and the strength parameter @xmath13 the excitation energy is given by @xmath14 , the impact parameter in a straight - line approximation is denoted by @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the projectile velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the target charge number is denoted by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 the electric multipole operator .    in coulomb excitation below the barrier , </S>",
    "<S> multiple electromagnetic excitation is usually treated in a coupled channels approach using the relevant states from appropriate nuclear models , like the harmonic vibrator or rigid rotor . for a review see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for coulomb excitation above the barrier becomes simpler , because the excitations tend to be sudden . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath14 is restricted to a few mev , the adiabaticity parameter @xmath20 is typically less than 1 , for the important range of impact parameters @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the nuclear radii of projectile and target . </S>",
    "<S> thus fast collisions become the domain of the sudden approximation @xcite , or of a recently developed low-@xmath20 approximation @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it can be advantageous to construct operators which take into account the influence of intermediate states .    for simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> let us use the straight - line approximation and the dipole approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the first order excitation amplitude is given by @xcite @xmath24 with @xmath25 where the projectile moves in the @xmath26-direction and the impact parameter points to the @xmath27-direction . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole effective charge is given by @xmath28 using a model of two pointlike inert clusters @xmath15 and @xmath29 with charge numbers @xmath30 , @xmath31 and masses @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the modified bessel functions . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath36 we get the classical coulomb push @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38 , the excitation amplitude can be evaluated easily to all orders in the sudden approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it is given by @xmath39 this could be generalized to higher multipolarities and trajectories corrected for coulomb deflection . by comparing @xmath40 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 the influence of multiple electromagnetic excitation can be assessed . </S>",
    "<S> this is a remarkably simple procedure , all intermediate states are included . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the excitation probability due to higher order effects is given by @xmath42    for loosely bound states , e.g. in @xmath0be = @xmath43be + n , we use simple model wave functions to reveal the characteristic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we choose two models , with the correct asymptotic behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> their differences give a feeling about the model dependence . </S>",
    "<S> for the wave functions we make the ansatz for the radial part in the initial state ( with orbital angular momentum @xmath44 ) @xmath45 which corresponds to the solution of the schrdinger equation with a @xmath46-like potential . </S>",
    "<S> for the final state ( @xmath47 ) we choose @xmath48 and the more extended wave function @xmath49 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are calculated from the binding energies @xmath52 . with these wave functions </S>",
    "<S> the calculated mean lifetimes of the @xmath11 state are 110  fs and 97  fs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are smaller than the experimental value of ( @xmath53 )  fs @xcite . despite this difference , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of higher order to first order effects can be given with some confidence , where , e.g. , common spectroscopic factors cancel out . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value depends on more sophisticated details of the nuclear model ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction factor @xmath54 can be calculated analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath55 and @xmath56 resp . , where we have introduced the parameter @xmath57 the parameter @xmath26 is directly related to @xmath58 ( eq .  [ chidef ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it describes the ratio of the strength of the coulomb push @xmath59 and the `` looseliness '' of the system , and is a measure of the importance of higher order effects . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath54 is plotted in fig .  1 for the two model wave - functions described above .    for large @xmath15 the sudden approximation fails ( @xmath60 ) , on the other hand , higher order effects diminish due to the decrease of the strength parameter @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the product @xmath61 is a very small number for low excitation energies @xmath14 and high projectile velocities @xmath17 . the ranges of validity for the first order calculation ( @xmath62 small , @xmath20 arbitrary ) and the sudden approximation ( @xmath20 small , @xmath62 arbitrary ) overlap . in a convenient and accurate interpolation procedure </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the total cross section in the following way @xmath63 which should be an accurate expression for all values of b in the integrand . for small impact parameters we have @xmath64 and the first order approximation cancels out in the calculation of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare it with the total cross section in the first order calculation @xmath66 both cross sections depend on the value of the minimum impact parameter @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the two cross sections will be similar so that their ratio is less affected by a change in @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> if the sudden approximation is not well enough fulfilled , one could use the low-@xmath20 approximation @xcite which takes second order electromagnetic effects into account .    for the @xmath0be coulomb excitation a reduction of the cross section from @xmath68  mb ( expected from the first order calculation ) to the measured @xmath69  mb </S>",
    "<S> was recently found in an experiment at ganil @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the parameter @xmath26 can become substantial in this case , and higher order effects are not negligible . for a collision with @xmath70  fm and an energy of @xmath71  mev ( @xmath72 ) </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath73 and from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 we see a substantial reduction of the excitation probability . </S>",
    "<S> in a recent experiment at riken @xcite , which is currently evaluated , an energy of about @xmath74  mev ( @xmath75 ) for the @xmath0be was used . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a value of @xmath76 for the same impact parameter corresponding to a smaller reduction .    </S>",
    "<S> the product @xmath77 takes on the small values @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , for the two models and the ganil conditions . at @xmath80  fm </S>",
    "<S> we get an excitation probability of 3.4% and 3.9% in the first order calculation , decreasing with @xmath81 . for impact parameters larger than @xmath82  fm </S>",
    "<S> the excitation becomes adiabatic and the excitation probability drops off exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation probability is small compared to 1 and the non - conservation of unitarity in the first order approximation will not affect the calculation of the cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> the apparent reduction of the b(e1)-value ( due to higher order effects ) is given by @xmath83 which is plotted in fig .  2 as a function of the projectile velocity @xmath17 for the two model wave functions described above . </S>",
    "<S> we assume a minimum impact parameter @xmath84  fm corresponding to a grazing collision of the projectile and target . </S>",
    "<S> this will give an estimate of the largest possible effect to be expected from the higher order contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a reduction , depending on the particular model chosen , of @xmath85 or @xmath86 for the ganil energy and @xmath87 or @xmath88 for the riken energy . </S>",
    "<S> the range of the reduction r in the two models gives a feeling of the reliabiliy of the results . </S>",
    "<S> the use of more realistic wavefunctions is outside the scope of the present work . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the excitation probability for the @xmath11 state by higher order effects will be accompanied by an increase of the cross section in the breakup channel .    in the dipole approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order correction was of @xmath89 order . </S>",
    "<S> e1-e2 excitation contributes already in second order . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is smaller than the third order e1-e1-e1 correction . </S>",
    "<S> for low @xmath20 we can estimate the ratio of the two amplitudes as @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 at the ganil energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus the dipole approximation is reasonable , at least for a first exploration .    </S>",
    "<S> possible higher order effects in the @xmath6 mg intermediate energy coulomb excitation @xcite can also be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a rigid rotor model , high energy coulomb excitation was calculated in the sudden approximation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic strength parameter is @xmath94 using the b(e2)-value found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we have ( see eq .  6 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a factor @xmath95 is missing on the rhs . ) @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98  fm for an energy of @xmath99  mev . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it can be seen that higher order effects are negligible for the value of the strength parameter @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the result found in the coupled channel calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a framework to apply corrections to 1@xmath101 order electromagnetic excitation . </S>",
    "<S> it is appropriate for fast collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we constructed operators which take the influence of intermediate states into account . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to a great simplification as compared , e.g. , to the coupled channels approach . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> a set of states , considered to be relevant , has to be chosen with known electromagnetic matrix - elements . in the present approach , </S>",
    "<S> of course , the model dependence can not be altogether avoided ; it enters when the corresponding matrix - elements of the operator has to be calculated , or at least estimated .    as an example we studied the excitation of the @xmath11 state in @xmath0be . the importance of higher order effects for this case of an extremely loosely bound nucleus </S>",
    "<S> was established . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate for the reduction of the cross section can only partly explain the observed reduction of the b(e1)-value in the ganil experiment . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a final analysis , more accurate calculations with improved wave functions , including e2 and nuclear effects in the excitation , should be performed .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to thank p.  g.  hansen and m.  g.  saint - laurent for stimulating discussions .    </S>",
