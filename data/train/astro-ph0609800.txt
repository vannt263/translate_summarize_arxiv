    "the nature of galactic formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) masers is a growing mystery . while hundreds of galactic oh , h@xmath0o , and ch@xmath6oh masers are known , only five galactic star - forming regions have associated h@xmath0co maser emission . to date , this emission is seen only in the @xmath7 transition at 6 cm wavelength . shortly after the discovery of the first h@xmath0co maser in ngc  7538 ( downes & wilson 1974 ; forster et al .  1980 ) , a radiative pumping model was proposed ( boland and de jong 1981 ) . the h@xmath0co masers discovered subsequently did not meet the conditions required for this mechanism ( gardner et al .",
    "1986 ; mehringer , goss , & palmer 1994 , hereafter mgp94 ; hoffman et al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter h03 ) .",
    "thus , twenty - five years after the discovery of the first h@xmath0co maser , these sources remain rare and the excitation mechanism remains unknown .",
    "sgr  b2 , the northernmost component of the extended sgr  b radio source , is located within a few hundred pc of the galactic center ( reid et al .",
    "( the distance to the galactic center is assumed to be 8.5  kpc in this paper . )",
    "sgr  b2 is comprised of three main star - forming complexes designated north ( n ) , middle or main ( m ) , and south ( s ) , and many smaller hii regions .",
    "the h@xmath0co masers occur throughout sgr  b2 , shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the heating mechanisms and complex chemistry of the region are subjects of ongoing study ( e.g. , gaume & claussen 1990 ; goicoechea et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "sgr  b2 contains nine individual h@xmath0co maser regions , several of which have multiple velocity components .",
    "all of the masers are unresolved at 1  angular resolution , except for maser c which mgp94 suggest consists of several masers blended within the beam .",
    "these regions are near hii regions distributed over the @xmath83.6 arcmin@xmath9 complex ( mgp94 ) .",
    "whiteoak and gardner ( 1983 ) and mgp94 designated the maser regions with letters ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath0co masers are observed over the velocity range @xmath10  km  s@xmath11@xmath12  km  s@xmath11 , while other species , such as h@xmath0o masers , are observed over a larger range @xmath13  km  s@xmath11@xmath14  km  s@xmath11  ( kobayashi et al .",

    "( similarly , h03 found one ngc  7538 feature to triple in intensity over @xmath15  yr . ) as initially noted by whiteoak and gardner ( 1983 ) , all of the sgr  b2 h@xmath0co masers lie close to oh , h@xmath0o , ch@xmath6oh , and nh@xmath6 masers .",
    "for most of the masers in mgp94 , the separation to an oh maser was less than 0.05 pc .",
    "recent successes in search techniques for new masers ( araya et al .  2004 , 2005 , 2006a ) and in high - resolution observational techniques ( h03 ) promise to provide empirical constraints for the development of a realistic model for the galactic h@xmath0co maser emission .",
    "the necessary steps in compiling an empirical picture of the h@xmath0co emission in sgr  b2 are ( 1 ) detailed imaging of the masers in order to quantify the intrinsic properties of the emission ( e.g. , brightness temperature ) , ( 2 ) assessment of intensity variability in the masers , and ( 3 ) precise astrometry for elucidating spatial relationships between the h@xmath0co masers and more common masers ( oh , h@xmath0o , ch@xmath6oh ) . in this paper",
    ", we present new observations of the h@xmath0co masers in sgr  b2 using the the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and very large array ( vla ) of the nrao .",
    "we observed the a and d h@xmath0co masers in sgr  b2 using the ten antennas of the vlba and the 27 antennas of the vla as an 11-station vlbi array .",
    "parameters of the observations are summarized in table  [ tbl - tab1 ] .",
    "the total observing time was approximately 8.0 hours alternating between the a and d pointing positions which are separated by approximately 1 . at each pointing position",
    "there is a useful correlated field of view of approximately 1  ( e.g. , bridle & schwab 1999 ) . to observe each of the nine h@xmath0co masers in sgr  b2 optimally would have required observations at nine pointing centers . because of signal - to - noise considerations , we observed only the two masers measured to be most intense by mgp94 .",
    "the baseline lengths of the vlba+y27 array range from 52  km to 8611  km ; the array is not sensitive to angular scales larger than 025 .",
    "the antennas have right- ( r ) and left- ( l ) circularly polarized feeds from which rr , ll , rl , & lr cross - correlations were formed .",
    "the visibilities were integrated for 8.4  s. the amplitude scale is set using online system temperature monitoring and _ a priori _ antenna gain measurements .",
    "the station delays were determined from observations of j1733 - 130 .",
    "the maser observations were phase referenced to j1745 - 283 ( called w56 in bower et al .",
    "because the properties of this source limit our observations , we discuss it in some detail .",
    "the absolute position uncertainty of this source is 12  milliarcseconds ( hereafter : mas ) ( reid et al .  1999 ) .",
    "bower et al .",
    "find that j1745 - 283 is probably the core of an extragalactic jet source and that its apparent size at 5  ghz ( 30  mas ) is determined by scatter - broadening .",
    "we also observed j1745 - 283 on 22 november 2002 using only the ten vlba stations ( a snapshot observation with a bandwidth of 4 mhz in both polarizations ) .",
    "the 2002 observation yields a deconvolved angular size of @xmath16  mas and an integrated flux density of 28  mjy ; the 2003 observation yields a size of @xmath17  mas and a flux density of 31  mjy .",
    "( the flux density determined by y27 [ the vla alone ] during the 2003 observations was 161  mjy . )",
    "bower et al .",
    "report an angular size @xmath18  mas and peak intensity 89  mjy  beam@xmath11  from vlba+y1 observations .",
    "therefore , the flux density must have decreased significantly between 1999 and 2002 .",
    "such variability would not be unusual for an inverted spectrum source like j1745 - 283 ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "our imaging of j1745 - 283 with the vlba makes use of only the inner - most stations ( vla , pie town , los alamos , fort davis , kitt peak , and owens valley ) because the source is resolved on longer baselines . some additional resolution for the maser observations",
    "was gained by self - calibration ; but , because only the shorter baselines in the vlba data were absolutely calibrated in phase , the position registration accuracy of the resulting vlba images is approximately 15  mas . in summary , we could not make use of the full potential resolution of the vlba when using this phase referencing calibrator , and no other suitable nearby source is known .",
    "we detected masers toward the a and d regions .",
    "the f maser is also within the correlated field of view near the a maser , but was not detected with the current sensitivity .",
    "the image and spectrum of the a maser from the vlbi data is shown in figure [ vlba - a ] . because the radio continuum of sgr  b2 is fully resolved by the vlba , no continuum subtraction was necessary .",
    "the positions , center velocities ( @xmath19 ) , linewidths ( @xmath20 ) , peak flux densities ( @xmath21 ) , and deconvolved major and minor axes and position angles are summarized in table  [ tbl - vlba ] . in parentheses following each entry",
    "are the 1-@xmath22 errors .",
    "the deconvolved sizes of the vlbi images of the a and d masers are @xmath23  mas . at the distance of sgr  b2",
    ", this size corresponds to a linear diameter of approximately 80  au , comparable to the sizes ( 30 to 130  au ) observed for the h@xmath0co masers in ngc  7538 and g29.96 - 0.02 using the vlba ( h03 ) .",
    "the brightness temperatures of the sgr  b2 a and d masers in the current vlbi data are @xmath24  k and @xmath25  k , respectively , similar to the @xmath26  k observed for other h@xmath0co masers ( h03 ) . no significant linear or circular polarization is detected in either maser ( @xmath27 20% for the strongest maser [ a]).gipsy/ ) and the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package ( http://www.nrao.edu/aips/ ) . ]      because of the known variability of h@xmath0co masers ( forster et al .  1985 ; h03 )",
    ", the sgr  b2 masers were observed in 2005 with the vla in order to access any possible time - variability .",
    "parameters of the observations are summarized in table  [ tbl - tab1 ] .",
    "the array configuration available was dnc for an observation period of approximately 7 hours .",
    "two pairs of rr and ll bands were recorded centered at the expected velocities of the a and the d masers .",
    "of the nine maser regions described by mgp94 , eight of the sources were detected .",
    "six velocity components in the regions observed by mgp94 lie outside the velocity range of the current observations .",
    "no new h@xmath0co maser regions were discovered .",
    "the 2005 data have inferior angular resolution ( 10  versus 1 ) but improved spectral resolution ( 0.19  km  s@xmath11  versus 1.5  km  s@xmath11 ) compared with the 1993 vla observations of mgp94 .",
    "comparison of the current data to the mgp94 data is uncertain due to ( 1 ) the severe blending of the strong h@xmath0co absorption with the nearby masers and ( 2 ) the insufficient velocity resolution of the mgp94 data , which did not spectrally resolve the lines .",
    "variability of the flux density of the masers is apparent and is discussed in ",
    "[ disc - vary ] .",
    "the 2005 results are summarized in table  [ tbl - vla ] and a spectrum from these data ( region e ) is shown in figure  [ vla - e ] .",
    "the c maser region is not discussed in this paper due to confusion of the maser spectra with nearby absorption and continuum emission . with the current 10  angular resolution of the vla data , as with the 1  resolution of mgp94",
    ", none of the masers are spatially resolved .    in ",
    "[ disc - vary ] , we also compare the current data with the 1983 vla observations of gardner et al .",
    "the velocity resolution of the 1983 data is 0.76 km  s@xmath11  and the angular resolution is 125 .",
    "although we resolve many of the maser line profiles in velocity for the first time with the 2005 vla data , most of the linewidths presented in table  [ tbl - vla ] agree with the values measured by gardner et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "no circular polarization is detected in any of the h@xmath0co masers .",
    "this corresponds to a 3-@xmath22 upper limit of approximately 4% circular polarization for the strongest maser ( a ) .",
    "images of radio sources are angularly broadened by scattering by the ionized component of the interstellar medium . in the direction of the galactic center ,",
    "this problem becomes severe ( e.g. , lazio & cordes 1998 ) . as discussed in  2.1 , j1745 - 283 ,",
    "is an extragalactic point - like source whose image is broadened to @xmath830 mas at 6 cm wavelength by scattering ( bower et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this section",
    "we discuss the extent to which this scattering medium affects the current vlbi observations of the h@xmath0co masers in sgr  b2 .    the observed size for j1745 - 283 , @xmath17  mas , is larger than the observed deconvolved size for the a maser , @xmath28  mas .",
    "this result may be expected even if both sources are intrinsically point - like because the proximity of the maser to the scattering medium results in reduced angular broadening ( e.g. , rickett 1990 ) . nevertheless , as discussed below",
    ", we expect significant angular broadening in the images of the masers . therefore , the deconvolved angular sizes in table  [ tbl - vlba ] are upper limits to the intrinsic sizes and the brightness temperatures are lower limits .",
    "gwinn et al .  ( 1988 ) quantified the scattered sizes of h@xmath0o and oh masers in sgr  b2 , finding a @xmath29 dependence for the broadening . from their determinations of minimum angular sizes of 0.3  mas for 1.35-cm h@xmath0o masers and 100  mas for 18-cm oh masers , we expect a minimum apparent size of approximately 9  mas for the 6.2-cm h@xmath0co masers .",
    "the deconvolved angular sizes of the masers in table  [ tbl - vlba ] are in agreement with this expectation .      in comparing the current vla observations with earlier vla data , both the differing angular resolution and spectral resolution",
    "must be considered . as discussed in ",
    "[ vla - obs ] , both the differences in array configuration and in correlator setup were significant . to compensate for the difference in velocity resolution , in table  [ tbl - fd ] we tabulate the velocity - integrated flux density for observations made in 1983 ( gardner et al .",
    "1986 ) , 1993 ( mgp94 ) , and 2003 and 2005 ( this paper ) . however , it is impossible to compensate for emission outside of the velocity range covered in the current observations and for the confusion of features caused by the lower angular resolution .",
    "( the notes in the final column of table  [ tbl - vla ] summarize limitations of the current data from these causes . )",
    "the error values in table  [ tbl - fd ] are dominated by systematic uncertainties rather than by thermal noise in most cases .",
    "we find that the a maser has approximately doubled in velocity - integrated flux density since 1993 , while b , g , and h increased between 1983 and 1993 , and subsequently decreased .",
    "the velocity - integrated flux densities from regions d , e , f , and i have not changed significantly since 1993 .      for the a and d h@xmath0co masers in sgr  b2 , a comparison of the current vlba+y27 data with past and current vla data shows two major differences : ( 1 ) only a fraction of the flux density seen with the vla is observed in the vlbi data ( @xmath870% for the a maser ; @xmath840% for the d maser ) ; and ( 2 ) the velocity widths in the vlbi data are more narrow than in the vla data ( @xmath880% for the a maser ; @xmath850% for the d maser ) . in this section we discuss a schematic model for the structure of the emission which addresses both the observed angular distribution and velocity widths .",
    "the flux density detected by the vla but resolved by vlbi baselines must lie at angular scales between @xmath30  mas ( the resolution of the shortest vlba+y27 interferometer spacings ) and @xmath31  mas ( the masers are unresolved in the mgp94 observations with 1  resolution ) , while the flux density observed with the vlbi is emitted by a source @xmath810  mas .",
    "these limits suggest a core - halo source morphology .",
    "a similar morphology was proposed by h03 for the h@xmath0co masers in ngc  7538 and g29.96 - 0.02 .",
    "a model consisting of two coincident circular gaussian components with different angular sizes can reproduce the observed results .",
    "for the a maser , the flux density observed with the vla is about 2000  mjy . to determine the decrease in flux density with increasing projected baseline length",
    ", we use the highest signal - to - noise baselines only : those between y27 and other antennas .",
    "the average flux densities observed on baselines with y27 are : 1400  mjy at 0.71  m@xmath32 ( to pie town , average projected spacing @xmath844  km ) denotes million wavelengths ] ; 1300  mjy at 3  m@xmath32 ; and 1200  mjy at 5  m@xmath32 .",
    "these data are fit by a two component gaussian model with a 600  mjy in a 300  mas halo and 1400  mjy in a 10  mas core .",
    "the brightness temperature of the halo is @xmath33  k ; for the 10 mas core component , @xmath34  k ( table  [ tbl - vlba ] , fig .",
    "[ vlba - a ] ) .",
    "a more precise model is justified only after higher signal to noise measurements .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the background radiation is relatively uniform on 300  mas angular scales because the continuum emission is well resolved on the vlba baselines .",
    "therefore , the difference in brightness temperatures between the core and halo components may be attributed to differences in maser gain .",
    "we estimate that the halo has a gain of approximately 10 ( in the exponential amplification regime ) and the core has a gain of approximately 2000 ( in the saturated regime ) . because the observed angular sizes are upper limits for the intrinsic sizes , the derived brightness temperatures are lower limits for the intrinsic brightness temperatures ; therefore",
    ", the actual gains may exceed the above values .",
    "the gain of the maser medium is dependent upon four factors : the pathlength , the density of h@xmath0co , the level inversion , and the velocity coherence ( see  4.2 of h03 ) .",
    "therefore , one or more of these factors must be significantly different between the core and halo components .",
    "we suggest that the narrower line widths arising from the core component indicate that the velocity coherence is enhanced in the core region compared to the halo , yielding a higher gain .",
    "similar arguments may be applied to the d maser , but the resulting ranges of size and @xmath35 are not well constrained because of the higher noise level on the vla - pie town baseline .",
    "additional maser species in other star - forming regions  excited oh ( palmer , goss , & devine 2003 ) , oh in supernova remnants ( hoffman et al.2005 ) , as well as other h@xmath0co masers ( h03 )  exhibit a similar narrowing of line widths between vla and vlba angular scales .      h@xmath0co absorption toward sgr  b2 has been studied extensively with 10  @xmath36 20  resolution both by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and mehringer et al .",
    "martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1990 ) noted that the absorption is dominated by three velocity components ( @xmath19= 55 , 64 , and 80 km  s@xmath11 ) , each with @xmath37 .",
    "linewidths of these absorption features ranged from 9  26 km  s@xmath11 , i.e. much greater than that of the maser features ( @xmath38  km  s@xmath11 ; see table  [ tbl - vla ] ) .",
    "mehringer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) provide optical depth profiles toward selected positions .",
    "all but maser e lies within 30  of one of these positions displayed .",
    "( maser e lies at a position with no radio continuum . )",
    "it is striking that the maser velocities , except for maser i ( which is more than a beamwidth away from the position of a displayed profile ) , do not occur in velocity ranges with large h@xmath0co optical depths .",
    "masers a and f occur in a velocity range with @xmath39=1 , but this velocity range is a rather sharp minimum in the optical depth profile at this position .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the gas containing the h@xmath0co masers is distinct from the bulk of the h@xmath0co containing gas observed in absorption .",
    "insight into why the maser containing gas may be distinct is provided by ( 3,3 ) and ( 4,4 ) nh@xmath6 observations made with the vla by martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . with their 3  resolution ,",
    "80 - 90% of the nh@xmath6 emission is resolved out , and only small angular scale features remain . among these features",
    "are a number of rings and arcs , most naturally interpreted as complete or partial shells with linear sizes @xmath82  pc .",
    "the shells are hot ( t@xmath40 50  70 k ) , and the h@xmath0 densities derived for them are typically a factor of 10 greater than those derived from the h@xmath0co absorption studies of martn - pintado et al .",
    "h@xmath0co masers c , d , e , g , and h fall within the field imaged by martn - pintado et al .",
    "as these authors note , all of the h@xmath0co masers occur at positions on hot nh@xmath6 shells .",
    "the higher temperature ( t@xmath41 100 k ) region of apparent interaction between shells a and b contains the closely spaced d , g , and h masers .",
    "martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) propose that the pumping mechanism for the h@xmath0co masers as well as that for the nh@xmath6 and class ii ch@xmath6oh masers must depend on the physical conditions in the hot shells .    in the search for additional constraints on the h@xmath0co emission environment",
