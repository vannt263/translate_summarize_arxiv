    "measurements of the casimir forces between metallic and semiconductor surfaces have also attracted considerable interest ( see reviews@xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental theory of the van der waals and casimir forces was elaborated by lifshitz@xcite and is called the _ lifshitz theory_. this theory expresses the free energy and force acting between two thick parallel plates ( semispaces ) in thermal equilibrium with an environment at temperature @xmath0 in terms of their frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities .",
    "the lifshitz theory was generalized@xcite for an arbitrary number of plane parallel layers of magnetodielectrics characterized by the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities . in the last few years the lifshitz - type theory was developed@xcite which describes the van der waals and casimir interaction between bodies of arbitrary shape .    considerable recent attention has been focused on physics of one - atom - thick graphene sheets and other carbon nanostructures which possess unusual electrical , mechanical and optical properties of high promise for many applications.@xcite among different processes and effects which have been investigated , a lot of papers was devoted to calculation of dispersion forces between two carbon nanostructures and between a carbon nanostructure and a body made of some usual material.@xcite many of them used in computations the lifshitz theory combined with one or other model for the dielectric permittivity of graphene.@xcite otherwise the reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic oscillations on graphene were expressed@xcite in terms of the polarization tensor in @xmath1-dimensional space - time in the framework of the dirac model ( an alternative formalism using coulomb coupling between density fluctuations which leads to the same results was also proposed@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the computational results for the casimir interaction between two graphene sheets computed using different models of dielectric permittivity on the one hand and the polarization tensor on the other hand have been compared and some disagreements were found . it was concluded that the origin of these disagreements invites further investigation .",
    "keeping in mind that when using the concept of dielectric permittivity graphene is likened to an ordinary material film of some definite thickness @xmath2 , in this paper we investigate the thermal casimir interaction in the presence of thin films .",
    "this problem was already discussed in the literature in relation to measurements of the casimir force .",

    "all these results are applicable for films made of usual materials at separation distances below 12 micrometers .",
    "they are not applicable to graphene films possessing large thermal effects even at very short separation distances.@xcite the casimir force between atomically thin au films was also calculated using anisotropic dielectric functions obtained with the help of density functional theory.@xcite this is in line with some dielectric functions used for the description of graphene.@xcite    below we calculate the casimir interaction in the presence of thin films in the so - called _",
    "classiacl limit_.@xcite this corresponds to the case of large separations ( high temperatures ) when only the zero - frequency terms of the lifshitz formulas provide the total casimir free energy and force .",

    "( [ eq71 ] ) .",
    "one should remember , however , that the lifshitz theory combined with the drude model violates the nernst heat theorem.@xcite if both metals are described at low frequencies by the plasma model under the condition ( [ eq30 ] ) , one obtains @xmath172 in disagreement with the main contribution to eq .",

    "in the foregoing we have considered the classical casimir interaction between two thin material films made of dielectrics and metals , between a film and a thick plate ( semispace ) , and between two films deposited on substrates .",
    "the consideration of a classical limit , where the interaction does not depend on the planck constant , presents some advantages , because all results can be found in simple analytic form .",
    "the problem of the casimir interaction between thin films has become topical because of increasing interest to the dispersion interactions of graphene . in this area",
    "many results were obtained by using the lifshitz theory and describing graphene sheets in close analogy with material films of nonzero thickness possessing some model dielectric permittivity . alternatively ( and more fundamentally ) the reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic oscillations on graphene described by the dirac model were expressed via the polarization tensor with no recourse to the concept of dielectric permittivity .",
    "some of the results obtained using both these approaches were found to be in mutual disagreement .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that the classical limit of the casimir interaction for two dielectric films with no free charge carriers is different from the classical limit for two dielectric semispaces and depends on film thicknesses .",
    "the respective casimir free energy decreases as an inversely fourth power of separation instead of the inversely second power , as it holds in the classical limit for two dielectric semispaces and for two graphene sheets described by the polarization tensor in the framework of the dirac model .",
    "thus , modeling of the pristine graphene as an insulating film should be considered as unrealistic .",
    "another conclusion is that one obtains the correct main contribution to the classical casimir free energy when the graphene sheets are modeled as material films with metallic - type dielectric permittivity .",
    "this , however , is achieved at separations of a few micrometers , i.e. , at much larger separations than the classical regime is achieved@xcite for graphene sheets described by the dirac model . as a result , at moderate separations between graphene sheets , which are of most experimental interest ,",
    "the theoretical predictions using the model of graphene as a dielectric possessing some dc conductivity can not be considered as enough reliable .",
    "one can also conclude that it is most prospective to investigate the dispersion interactions between graphene sheets , both isolated and deposited on substrates , using the formalism of the polarization tensor . in this connection it is desirable to generalize the quantum electrodynamical formalism to the case when the two - dimensional layer described by the polarization tensor is sandwiched between two material plates described by two different dielectric permittivities .",
