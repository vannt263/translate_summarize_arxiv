    "accurate semi - analytic and empirical modelling of galaxy formation is challenging , in part because the correlations of key galaxy and halo variables remain unknown .",
    "observational manifestations of these correlations include galaxy scaling relations , and through detailed investigations of these relations we may hope to build knowledge of the galaxy  halo connection .    over the past decades , two models which have proven useful for capturing aspects of the galaxy  halo connection",
    "are abundance matching ( am ; @xcite ) , and the angular momentum partition model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mmw ) .",
    "the former asserts a nearly monotonic relationship between stellar mass and a halo proxy , essentially establishing the dependence of galaxy mass on halo mass and concentration required to reproduce observations of galaxies clustering and dynamics  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter imposes a proportionality between galaxy and halo specific angular momentum , making galaxy size a function of galaxy mass and halo mass , concentration and spin .",
    "this yields good agreement with observed average galaxy sizes over a wide range of mass ( @xcite , hereafter dw15 ) .    despite these successes ,",
    "however , the conjunction of these models ( hereafter `` am+mmw '' ) is known to make incorrect predictions for two properties of the galaxy population .",
    "the first is the scatter @xmath0 in the stellar mass  size relation ( msr ;  @xcite ) .",
    "angular momentum partition sets galaxy size proportional to halo spin , @xmath1 , and hence requires the scatter in size at fixed mass to be at least as large as that in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , these scatters are @xmath2 dex and @xmath3 dex in observed galaxies and simulations respectively ( dw15 ) .",
    "the second is the correlation of residuals of the mass  size and mass  velocity relations ( @xmath4 ) , which is negligible in observations but predicted to be negative ( @xcite ; dw15 ) .",
    "these discrepancies indicate that the galaxy  halo correlations on which @xmath0 and @xmath4 depend are inadequately captured by am+mmw .",
    "this issue is relevant also for semi - analytic models .",
    "many such models set galaxy size proportional to halo virial radius ( e.g.  @xcite ) , sometimes with a single value for all halo spins .",
    "others that use additional physical assumptions find important correlations of size with variables beyond halo mass and spin , but neglect the scatter in sizes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the empirical identification of the aspects of the galaxy  halo connection responsible for realistic size distributions  and correlations with velocity  will be of use in constraining such models and guiding the choice of inputs .",
    "the failure of am+mmw may be due either to inaccuracies in the properties of the halo populations on which the models were based ( e.g. their neglect of baryonic physics ) , or incorrect prediction of the models themselves for the galaxy  halo connection . to resolve this dilemma",
    ", we turn in this _ letter _ to hydrodynamical simulations , which enable the prediction of galaxy properties without prior assumptions on galaxy  halo correlations . in particular , we investigate @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the eagle simulation  @xcite , which has been shown to match the galaxy size distribution as well as many other aspects of galaxy phenomenology  @xcite . @xcite and  @xcite have previously shown that the mmw model fails to match the output of the eagle simulation and its ancestor owls .",
    "@xcite found the angular momentum of stars to correlate with that of the inner halo in eagle ,  @xcite reported weak correlation of galaxy properties with halo spin in the related gimic simulation , and  @xcite studied the eagle tully  fisher and mass  size relations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : method ] we describe the eagle simulation and our methods to measure and explore the origin of @xmath0 and @xmath4 . in section",
    "[ sec : observables ] we show that both @xmath0 and @xmath4 are significantly nearer to their observed values in eagle than predicted by the am+mmw model , and close to the predictions of am alone .",
    "we show the success of eagle over am+mmw to be due not to differences in underlying halo properties caused by baryons ( section  [ sec : halo_comp ] ) , but rather to the correlations of halo variables with galaxy size ( section  [ sec : galhal_comp ] ) . in eagle ,",
    "the sizes of low - redshift galaxies are only weakly correlated at fixed stellar mass with the mass , concentration and spin of their haloes , violating the assumption of angular momentum partition .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] discusses the broader implications of these results , and summarises .",
    "eagle is a recently completed set of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations , run with a modified version of gadget-3  @xcite and including hydrodynamics , radiative cooling , star formation , stellar feedback and black hole dynamics .",
    "the subgrid models were calibrated against the present - day stellar mass function and the normalisation of the mass  size relation .",
    "the simulations used a flat @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we analyse the @xmath11 snapshot of simulation ref - l100n1504 , which tracks @xmath12 dark matter and gas particles from @xmath13 to the present day in a box with comoving side length 100  mpc , in addition to the corresponding dark matter only ( dmo ) run in which baryonic effects were switched off .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite for further information about the simulation .      to enable direct comparison with the results of dw15",
    ", we perform halo finding on both the dmo and hydrodynamical ( hereafter `` hydro '' ) runs of the eagle simulation using rockstar  @xcite .",
    "we define spin as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a halo s angular momentum and @xmath16 its total energy  @xcite , and calculate concentration ( @xmath17 ) using @xmath18 ( derived from @xmath19 ;  @xcite ) rather than fitting an nfw profile .",
    "we include only dark matter when calculating @xmath17 and @xmath1 .",
    "we multiply the dmo haloes virial masses by @xmath20 to compare to the hydro haloes , where again we include dark matter only ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "next , we match the dmo rockstar catalogue to both the hydro rockstar catalogue and the subfind catalogue  @xcite made by the eagle pipeline , as follows .",
    "both halo finders produce a list of particles associated with each halo that they identify .",
    "since the two runs share the same dark matter particle ids , we can match the haloes by finding common particles . in practice , given a halo in the dmo run ( halo a ) , we first find the halo ( halo b ) in the hydro run that contains the most particles of halo a. if halo a also contains the most particles of halo b , we identify a `` match '' between them .",
    "since the subfind catalogue of the hydro run also provides the connection between the haloes and galaxies , this method establishes a link between the haloes in the dmo and hydro rockstar catalogues , and the galaxies in the subfind catalogue . the fraction of haloes in the hydro run hosting galaxies with @xmath22 that are matched by our procedure is @xmath23 per cent ; these haloes are not significantly biased in @xmath21 , @xmath17 or @xmath1 .      for both the data and models , we take @xmath0 to be the gaussian scatter in radius of the best - fitting power - law relation is increased by curvature in the msr ; thus @xmath0 for the eagle relation ( see fig .",

    "we have verified that restricting to @xmath27 does not affect our conclusions .",
    "we measure @xmath4 as the spearman rank correlation coefficient of the @xmath28 relation , where @xmath29 denotes the residual of quantity @xmath30 after subtracting the value expected at that @xmath24 given a power - law fit to the @xmath31 relation , @xmath32 :    @xmath33    we quantify the dependence of @xmath25 on halo variables with the spearman correlation coefficients @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",

    "]    as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] ( and discussed in detail in dw15 ) , the am+mmw model compares poorly with observations in both @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath0 includes a contribution of around 0.25 dex from @xmath1 , and further contributions from the spread in @xmath21 and @xmath17 at fixed @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath4 has contributions both from baryonic mass ( higher surface density means larger rotation velocity ) , and from the dark matter , since in the mmw model more concentrated haloes , which generate larger rotation velocities , host smaller galaxies at fixed angular momentum .",
    "the am model , which includes only the baryonic mass contribution , predicts a @xmath59 anticorrelation that is weaker but still stronger than the data s .",
    "we now investigate the origin of the difference between the eagle and am+mmw results .",
    "a possible reason for the apparent failure of the am+mmw model is its application in dw15 to haloes from an n - body simulation in which baryonic effects were neglected . in figure",
    "[ fig : rs ] we show the fractional differences in @xmath21 , @xmath17 and @xmath1 of all matched haloes in the eagle dmo and hydro runs , and compare in the insets their overall distributions .",
    "we find the haloes to be a few per cent less massive on average in the hydro run , and their @xmath17 and @xmath1 values to be similar .",
    "( @xcite reported larger differences in halo mass because they included baryons as well as dark matter in the mass definition . )",
    "the spin distribution is slightly wider in the hydro run , which goes in the wrong direction to account for the lower @xmath0 in eagle than in the am+mmw model .",
    "in addition , we find that the @xmath60 relations of the two runs are similar , and that the effects of baryons on @xmath21 and @xmath17 are negligibly correlated with @xmath61 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : spin_corr ] we compare the correlations of @xmath1 with @xmath21 and @xmath17 in the two runs .",
    "if spin was more positively correlated with @xmath21 or @xmath17 with baryonic effects included , then the corresponding increase in rotational velocity caused by dark matter for larger galaxies would compensate for the reduction in the rotation velocity caused by baryons , which could allow the am+mmw model to achieve agreement with the measured @xmath4 .",
    "we do not find such an increased correlation , however , leading us to conclude that the differences between the eagle and am+mmw models in their predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath4 arise not from the underlying dark matter halo structure , but rather from differences in the correlations of galaxy and halo variables .",

    "[ fig : rs ] , this shows that the difference between the eagle and am+mmw models in their predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath4 are not due to changes to the haloes caused by baryons .",

    "galaxy size correlates only weakly with each halo variable , with the result that the predicted @xmath4 is similar to the am case .",
