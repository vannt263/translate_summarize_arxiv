    "if it would be a little smaller , all hydrogen would have been burned to helium .",
    "isospin breaking in hadron masses has two sources , the mass difference of up and down quarks , and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "both effects are of the same order of magnitude and can not be separated unambiguously due to the nonperturbative nature of the strong interactions .",
    "this makes a direct calculation from qcd + qed necessary  @xcite .",
    "while substantial progress has been made , @xcite is the only other published work to report simulations with fully dynamical qcd + qed .    in",
    "@xcite we have outlined a program to systematically investigate the pattern of flavor symmetry breaking in three - flavor lattice qcd for wilson - type fermions .",
    "our strategy was to start from the su(3 ) symmetric point with all three quark masses equal , @xmath4 , and extrapolate towards the physical point keeping the average sea quark mass @xmath5 constant .",
    "for this trajectory to reach the physical quark masses , @xmath6 is tuned to the physical value of the average pseudoscalar meson mass @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the distance from @xmath6 by @xmath8 this implies @xmath9 on our quark mass trajectory . to describe how physical quantities depend on the quark masses , we taylor expand about the symmetric point  @xcite .",
    "this results in polynomials in @xmath6 and @xmath10 , which we classify into representations of the su(3 ) and @xmath11 flavor groups . as we keep @xmath6 constant and change only the octet part of the mass matrix , to first order in @xmath10 flavor symmetry is broken by an su(3 ) octet , leading to gell - mann  okubo mass relations .",
    "we follow a similar approach here with qed added  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the electromagnetic current is similar to the symmetry of the quark mass matrix .",
    "the simplifications that come from @xmath12 in the mass case are analogous to the simplifications we get from the identity @xmath13 .",
    "a difference between quark mass and electromagnetic expansions is that in the mass expansion we can have both odd and even powers of @xmath10 , whereas only even powers of the quark charges @xmath14 are allowed .",
    "we consider contributions of @xmath15 only .",
    "hence , qed corrections can be simply read off from the mass expansion presented in  @xcite , dropping the linear terms and changing masses to charges .    for the masses of octet mesons with the flavor structure @xmath16 , and",
    "all annihilation diagrams turned off , we find to leading order in @xmath17 @xmath18 up to corrections of @xmath19 .",
    "several of the coefficients in ( [ mmass ] ) can be matched up with different classes of feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] . the first diagram , with both ends of the photon attached to the same valence quark , contributes to @xmath20 .",
    "the second diagram , with the photon crossing between the valence lines , contributes to @xmath21 .",
    "the last diagram , with the photon being attached to the sea quarks , is an example of a diagram contributing to @xmath22 .",
    "it would be missed out if the electromagnetic field was quenched instead of dynamical .",
    "similar assignments hold for the mixed ( charge squared times mass ) terms . for a single choice of sea quark masses ,",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms can be absorbed into the constant @xmath24 and the @xmath25 term .",
    "however , for a combined fit of both qcd and qcd + qed data we will need these coefficients .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "similarly , for octet baryons with the flavor structure @xmath26 we find to leading order in @xmath17 @xmath27 up to corrections of @xmath19 .",

    "it greatly helps to vary valence and sea quark masses independently  @xcite , which is referred to as partial quenching ( pq ) . in this case",

    "this is to say that hadron mass splittings are unaffected by pq at this order , as pq moves ( e.g. ) all octet mesons and baryons by the same amount .",
    "we would have to expand to cubic terms to see pq errors in the splittings  @xcite .",
    "hence , pq calculations offer a computationally cheaper way of obtaining them .    in qcd + qed",
    "there is some ambiguity in the definition of the symmetric point .",
    "the definition we have chosen is that the electrically neutral pseudoscalar mesons have the same masses , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a fictitious electrically neutral quark .",

    "we like to add that simulations at the symmetric point already catch the essential features of the physical qcd + qed vacuum , as flavor singlet quantities vary slowly along the @xmath75 trajectory  @xcite .    on these ensembles",
    "we have computed pq pseudoscalar meson and octet baryon masses for a variety of quark masses ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this leads to about 40 pseudoscalar masses and 70 baryon masses per ensemble .",
    "the baryons include several artificial states containing the fictitious @xmath42 quark and charge 2 baryons with flavor structure @xmath80 .",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) is invariant under @xmath81 gauge transformations @xmath82 however , this is not the case for propagators of charged particles , which demands fixing the gauge , as in perturbation theory .",

    "<S> lattice qcd simulations are now reaching a precision where isospin breaking effects become important . </S>",
    "<S> previously , we have developed a program to systematically investigate the pattern of flavor symmetry beaking within qcd and successfully applied it to meson and baryon masses involving up , down and strange quarks . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we extend the calculations to qcd + qed and present our first results on isospin splittings in the pseudoscalar meson and baryon octets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we obtain the nucleon mass difference of @xmath0 and the electromagnetic contribution to the pion splitting @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> further we report first determination of the separation between strong and electromagnetic contributions in the @xmath2 scheme . </S>"
