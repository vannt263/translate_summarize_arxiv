    "determination of the unknown oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the important object of future neutrino experiments . it has been known that even if the values of the oscillation probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are exactly given we can not determine uniquely the values of the oscillation parameters due to three kinds of parameter degeneracies : the intrinsic @xmath7 degeneracy , the degeneracy of @xmath8 , and the degeneracy of @xmath9 .",
    "each degeneracy gives a twofold ambiguity , so in general we have an eightfold ambiguity .",
    "these degeneracies cause a problem in determination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and we have to take into account these ambiguities in handling the data in future long baseline experiments . here",
    "i will discuss only the oscillation probabilities without details analysis of statistical and systematic errors .",
    "there is a way to overcome the ambiguity due to the intrinsic degeneracy .",
    "namely , if one performs a long baseline experiment at the oscillation maximum ( i.e. , with @xmath11 ) , then it is reduced to the @xmath12 ambiguity .",
    "thus , if the jparc experiment measures the oscillation probabilities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 at the oscillation maximum with an approximately monoenergetic beam , then the possible solutions in the ( @xmath10 , @xmath14 ) plane @xcite given by jparc look like either fig .",
    "1(a ) or fig .",
    "1(b ) , depending on whether @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where the difference between the case with normal hierarchy ( @xmath17 ) and the one with inverted hierarchy ( @xmath18 ) is small because the matter effect is small in the jparc experiment .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    if @xmath15 then the values of @xmath3 and @xmath19 are close to each other for all the solutions , and the ambiguity is not serious as far as @xmath3 and @xmath19 are concerned ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig1](a ) ) . on the other hand , if @xmath16 then the @xmath19 ambiguity has to be resolved to determine @xmath3 and @xmath19 to good precision ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig1](b ) ) . in this case",
    "there are three potential possibilities to resolve this @xmath19 ambiguity : ( a ) reactor experiments , ( b ) the @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) channel of accelerator long baseline experiments and ( c ) the so - called silver channel @xmath22 .",
    "a reactor experiment measures @xmath23 which depends only on @xmath3 to a good approximation , so that it gives a constraint as a vertical band in the ( @xmath10 , @xmath14 ) plane ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig2](a ) ) .",
    "thus , if the experimental error in the reactor experiment is smaller than the difference between the true and fake values of @xmath3 , then the reactor experiment can solve the @xmath19 ambiguity . to resolve the @xmath19 ambiguity at a high confidence level ,",
    "it is necessary for a reactor experiment to have high sensitivity ( e.g. , @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that the sensitivity in reactor experiments is bounded from below by the uncorrelated systematic error @xmath25 of the detector : @xmath26 where const .",
    "depends on the numbers of the reactors and the detectors , and is equal to 2.8 at 90%cl in the case with one reactor and two detectors .",
    "( [ sensitivity ] ) implies that it is necessary to reduce @xmath25 in order to improve the sensitivity .",
    "if the uncorrelated systematic error @xmath25 of the detectors is independent of the number of the detectors , then there is a way to reduce @xmath25 . in the case with one reactor , if one puts @xmath27 identical detectors at the near site and @xmath27 identical detectors at the far site , where all these detectors are assumed to have the same uncorrelated systematic error @xmath25 , then the lower bound of the sensitivity becomes @xmath28 hence it follows theoretically that the more identical detectors one puts , the better sensitivity one gets .",
    "the assumption that @xmath25 is independent of @xmath27 may not be satisfied in reality , but if the dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath27 is weaker than @xmath29 , @xmath30 decreases as @xmath27 increases . this possibility should be seriously thought about to improve the sensitivity in the future reactor experiments .",
    "the @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) channel gives poor resolution in general , as far as the @xmath19 ambiguity is concerned , because the curves given by this channel intersect almost in parallel with the jparc line and the experimental significance to reject the wrong hypothesis is expected to be small ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig2](b),(b ) ) .",
    "the situation changes very little even if one uses @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the silver channel @xmath22 offers a promising possibility to resolve the @xmath19 ambiguity , because the curves given by the silver channel intersect with the jparc line almost perpendicularly and the experimental significance to reject the wrong hypothesis is expected to be large ( cf .",

    "the fake values @xmath40 due to the sgn(@xmath38 ) ambiguity and @xmath41 due to the @xmath39 ambiguity satisfy the following for the jparc case @xcite : @xmath42 this suggests that the @xmath19 ambiguity does not cause a serious problem for @xmath43 , while the one due to the sgn(@xmath38 ) ambiguity does . in fig.[fig3 ] the sensitivity to cp violation is given at 3@xmath44 by a semi - quantitative analysis for the jparc experiment in the case of ( a ) @xmath17 and ( b ) @xmath18 , taking into account of the ambiguity due to sgn(@xmath38 ) .",
    "the the dashed lines in the figures are given by @xmath45 for the correct assumption , and by @xmath46 for the wrong assumption .",
    "in the region bounded by the black ( with the correct assumption on the mass hierarchy ) or grey ( with the wrong assumption ) curves , jparc can not claim cp violation to be nonzero . from this , therefore , we see that it is important to resolve the sgn(@xmath38 ) ambiguity to determine the precise value of @xmath4 .    to resolve the sgn(@xmath38 ) ambiguity , it is easy to see that long baseline experiments with long baselines ( @xmath471000 km ) are advantageous , since the matter effect @xmath48 for the density @xmath49 is something like 1/2000 km .",
