    "[ fig : lc ] ) , and the data was affected by pileup at the @xmath614% level ( see below ) .",
    "the background was very low and estimated to be about 1% of the source count rate within the source region .",
    "the position of the x - ray source , determined by using the ciao package tool _ celldetect _ , is @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( j2000 ) .",

    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "each point represents 324  s of data and the error bars represent the square root of the total number of counts in each bin divided by 324  s. we have also computed the hardness ratio ( hr ) by dividing the count rate in the 1.710  kev energy range by the corresponding one in the 0.31.7  kev range .",
    "we show at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] the hr as a function of time , but with a larger bin time of 1024  s to have relatively small error bars .",
    "the count rate is moderately variable on timescales from several minutes to hours , with an average of 0.144@xmath80.029  counts  s@xmath3 ( @xmath19=1.84 ) .",
    "the count rate increases during the observation , and a linear fit yields a 30% increase at the end with respect to the beginning .",
    "superimposed on this trend is a miniflare 32  ks after the start of the observation , when the count rate increases by a factor of @xmath62 over a timescale of @xmath61000  s , with a total duration of @xmath63  ks .",
    "this miniflare is accompanied by an increase of the hr .",
    "this kind of moderate variability was first observed with _ asca _ , which detected source variations of about a 50% on timescales of half an hour @xcite .",
    "archival _ bepposax _ observations carried out in 1997 have also shown short - term variability @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that small amplitude ( @xmath2010% ) radio flares were detected in with a recurrence period of about 5  ks @xcite .",
    "the presence of hour timescale x - ray miniflares has also been reported in the case of @xcite . a hardness vs. intensity diagram for the whole _",
    "observation of  reveals a positive trend , the source is harder when it is brighter , but with a low significant correlation coefficient of @xmath21=0.44 .",
    "this is in contrast to the clear correlation found in previous _",
    "observations by @xcite .      since the hr is not significantly variable ( @xmath19=1.78 ) , we considered the whole data set for the spectral analysis . to perform",
    "the spectral fits we restricted the energy range between 0.3 and 10  kev .",
    "a fit to the data with a bremsstrahlung model provided @xmath19=1.6 , and no lines nor a multicolor blackbody were required to fit the data .",
    "an absorbed power - law fit yielded @xmath19=1.14 , but a significant excess above 7  kev was apparent in the residuals .",
    "due to the count rate and time frame used , this is probably due to pileup .",
    "the addition of the pileup model implemented in _ sherpa _",
    "@xcite to the absorbed power law yielded different sets of possible spectral parameter values , all of them equally compatible from a statistical point of view .",
    "nevertheless , for some of them the derived fluxes were a factor @xmath225 higher than previous measurements at similar orbital phases .",
    "we found that reasonable results were obtained when fixing the event pileup fraction parameter @xmath23 to 0.95 : @xmath19=0.83 , grade migration parameter @xmath24 , @xmath25  @xmath2 , @xmath5 , pileup fraction 14% , and @xmath1  ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 .",
    "the significance of adding a pileup component to the absorbed powerlaw fit was estimated via an f - test : the probability that this improvement happens by chance is 0.8% .    to check the robustness of the results obtained with the spectral fitting with the pileup model we have conducted two additional tests .",
    "first of all we have obtained the spectrum of the readout streak , which is not affected by pileup , after excluding the 5 pixel diameter region around the source .",
    "since it only contains 287  counts , we have fitted the spectrum using low count number statistical weights .",
    "fixing @xmath11 to @xmath26  @xmath2 we have obtained @xmath27 , which is consistent within errors to the value given above .",
    "an additional test has been conducted by fitting the spectrum of the source wings , which are not affected by pileup .",
    "we have built a spectrum with data beyond a radius of 1.5  from the source center ( i.e. , excluding the inner @xmath28 pixels , those most affected by pileup ) and fitted it with and without fixing @xmath11 , obtaining in both cases a photon index harder than the one obtained with the pileup model .",
    "a similar test with data beyond 2.0  has provided similar results .",
    "these tests clearly suggest that the photon index value obtained with the pileup model is reliable , and that the source was intrinsically hard during this observation .",
    "moreover , the estimate of the total source flux using the fitted flux of the source wings and the fraction of the simulated psf ( see next section ) counts contained in the wings is compatible for @xmath23=0.95 .",
    "this is not the case for the lower values of @xmath23 that implied the much higher source fluxes discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "these results give us confidence on the results obtained with the pileup model .",
    "regarding the emission of  itself , the flux we report here , @xmath1",
    "ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 , is compatible within errors to that obtained during a short _ xmm _ observation also around phase 0 @xcite .",
    "however , the photon index @xmath5 found in the _ chandra _ data is the hardest ever found , only compatible with any previous value at the @xmath29 level and harder , at a @xmath65@xmath0 level , than the _ xmm _ one at the same phase ( @xmath30 ) . it is outside the scope of this work to put forward a physical model for the spectral state of the source .",
    "we will just point out that the x - ray photon index can be harder than the canonical value of 1.5 , which corresponds to a electron population with power - law index of 2 .",
    "this can occur for different reasons , for example a klein - nishina dominated steady particle population ( see @xcite for an extended discussion ) .",
    "a very hard spectral component ( e.g. inverse compton or bremsstrahlung ) , produced by the lower energy part of the particle spectrum with a high low - energy cutoff , may also harden the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the lack of simultaneous data at higher energies does not allow us to distinguish between the two hypotheses .",
    "we finally selected the data corresponding to the miniflare and obtained a spectrum for it , which had poor statistics and was especially affected by pileup . a fit to this spectrum yielded a photon index compatible within ( large ) errors to that of the whole observation spectrum .",
    "a preliminary visual inspection of the source image reveals the possible existence of extended emission .",
    "to better study this issue we have used _",
    "chart _ and _ marx _ to simulate the point spread function ( psf ) accounting for pileup effects .",
    "this psf has the same counts as the source , which are distributed in energy according to the source spectrum including pileup , being spatially distributed in the image considering pileup as well .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] the images corresponding to the source , the psf , and the residuals obtained after subtracting the psf from the source , all of them smoothed with a gaussian kernel of three pixels in radius to enhance the faint emission . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : images]-left , there appears to be extended x - ray emission around  at distances between 5  and 12  from the source center .",
    "the subtraction of the nearly circular psf , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : images]-middle , from the source image yields the residuals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : images]-right .",
    "there seems to be a region with an excess of counts at several arcseconds from the image core and nearly half - surrounding it .",
    "this excess region , already apparent in the source image , presents some spots and extends mainly towards the north - east .    to check the reliability of the 512  excess we have created radial profiles of the surface brightness for the source and the simulated psf with the tools _ dmextract _ and _ dmtcalc_. we show the radial profiles with bins of 1  in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] , where hints of excess are seen in the region 512  away from the center .",
    "moreover , we note that a comparison with the unscattered point - like blazar source located at high - galactic latitude ( following the procedure described in @xcite ) provided an even clearer departure of  from a point - like source . nevertheless , we prefer to show here the most conservative results obtained with the psf , simulated at the chip position and with the observed spectrum of  including pileup effects .",
    "next we computed the excess of source counts over the psf in an annulus with inner and outer radii of 5  and 125 , and obtained 58@xmath818 counts ( 3.2@xmath0 , or single trial probability of @xmath31 ) .",
    "we have looked for excesses in a circle with radius 20  centered on the source , without considering the central 5  radius circle , thus yielding an area of @xmath32@xmath33 . dividing this by the area of the annulus where we obtained the 3.2@xmath0 excess we find that the number of trials is 2.9 , yielding a probability of @xmath34 , which corresponds to 2.9@xmath0 .",
    "however , since the extended emission appears to be asymmetric , we have computed the excess dividing the 5125 annulus in four quadrants .",
    "although there is no excess towards the west and south directions , the excess is of about 1.5@xmath0 to the east , and reaches 3.8@xmath0 to the north ( or single trial probability of @xmath35 ) .",
    "we note that this excess is not located in the path of the readout streak .",
    "the number of trials is now 11.6 , providing a post - trial probability of @xmath36 or a 3.2@xmath0 detection .",
    "the excess in the northern quadrant of the 5125 annulus , with a projected distance of 0.050.12  pc from the center of , represents 0.5% of the source counts , implying ( with @xmath13=1.25 ) a flux of @xmath64@xmath37  ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 and @xmath382@xmath39  ergs  s@xmath3 .",
    "the chandra observations reported here show that  presented moderate fluxes of @xmath40  ergs  @xmath2  s@xmath3 , as expected around orbital phase @xmath41 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source appeared to be moderately variable on timescales of @xmath61000  s. the hydrogen column density was @xmath25  @xmath2 , similar to the values found in the past .",
    "the photon index was @xmath42 , harder than the previously measured values in the range 1.51.9 .",
    "finally , an excess between 5 and 125 towards the north of has been detected at the 3.2@xmath0 level ( post - trial ) .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of x - ray binaries have provided the most detailed x - ray images of these sources . extended circular emission , produced by ism dust grains along the line of sight that scatter mainly the soft x",
    "- rays @xcite , has been found in most cases @xcite .",
    "however , the possible extended structure around  we report here is asymmetric , suggesting its intrinsic nature .",
    "plausible explanations of this diffuse radiation could be thermal bremsstrahlung produced by hot and dense ism close to the source , perhaps heated and compressed by a large - scale outflow originated in , and synchrotron or inverse compton emission produced by non - thermal particles accelerated at the termination region of the aforementioned outflow .",
    "the first possibility would require a medium with densities significantly higher than those inferred from the ism absorption towards .",
    "if non - thermal , the extended emission would more likely be of synchrotron origin due to its shorter timescales to radiate at a few kev than those of inverse compton or relativistic bremsstrahlung . in any case , the asymmetric distribution of counts could be related to the main direction of the outflow and/or to ism inhomogeneities .",
    "regardless of the morphology , we can say that efficient energy transport is probably taking place up to distances of at least @xmath60.1  pc in .",
    "however , only deeper high - resolution observations can help to better detect the excess ( currently at a 3.8@xmath0 level , 3.2@xmath0 post - trial ) and determine the precise morphology and underlying physics .",
    "a final comment on the hydrogen column density appears necessary .",
    "the @xmath43 value inferred from spectral fits to all available x - ray observations is in the range 0.450.70@xmath44  @xmath2 , while the @xmath11 value of the ism inferred from uv / optical absorption is in the range 0.450.60@xmath45  @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the detected x - rays suffer small intrinsic absorption , if any .",
    "moreover no significant @xmath11 orbital variations have ever been detected ( as pointed out previously by @xcite after _ asca _ observations ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the apparent lack of significant soft x - ray absorption and the constancy of @xmath11 along the orbit are difficult to be explained considering the slow and dense material expelled from the companion star .",
    "the x - ray emitter should be placed away from the binary system to produce such observational results , in contrast with the expectations from classical colliding wind and microquasar scenarios .",
    "this issue certainly requires further investigation .",
