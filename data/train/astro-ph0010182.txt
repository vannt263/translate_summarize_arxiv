    "the wavelength bands were scanned in the sws02 mode with a typical on - target time of 100  s. three sources were also observed in the sws01 mode but the signal - to - noise ratio of these observations is rather poor and will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "data were processed interactively at the mpe from the standard processed data ( spd ) to the auto analysis results ( aar ) stage using calibration files of september 1997 and were reprocessed automatically through version 7.0 of the standard off - line processing ( olp ) routines to the aar stage .",

    "@xcite ) . because of the medium spectral resolution of the sws02 mode ( @xmath35 ) and the wavelength calibration uncertainties ( @xmath36  depending on the wavelength , see valentijn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it is difficult to undertake a detail comparison between the kinematics of the @xmath0  lines and those of the @xmath3  and @xmath2  lines .",

    "the radial velocity of the @xmath0  lines agrees with at least one of the @xmath3  components listed in table [ tab_co ] .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of resolution does not allow us to establish if the @xmath0  emission is indeed arising from just one or several of the co velocity components since , in general , all of them are within the velocity range of the unresolved @xmath0  emission .",
    "m@xmath37  is the only cloud for which we can say that the warm @xmath0  is not likely to arise in all the velocity components seen in co. the co components are centered at -110 , 11 , and 133  , while the @xmath0  s(1 ) line is centered at -70  .",
    "even with the spectral resolution of the sws02 mode , one can see that the co component with _ forbidden _ velocities ( 133  ) is not likely to contribute to the @xmath0  emission .",
    "table [ tab_h2 ] also lists the widths of the @xmath0  s(1 ) lines .",
    "the @xmath0   line widths of the gc clouds tend to be larger than the instrumental resolution for extended sources ( @xmath38   for the s(1 ) line , see lutz et al .",
    "this is due to the large intrinsic line widths typical of the gc clouds and mainly , to the presence of several velocity components along the line of sight that contribute to the @xmath0  emission .",
    "however , not all the sources that show co emission in several velocity components have line widths larger than @xmath38  ( for instance  or ) .",

    "gsten et al . 1985 ) and the non - equilibrium @xmath0  ortho - to - para ratio of two sources in our sample ( rodrguez - fernndez et al .",
    "the high  abundance derived in the previous section points to a mechanical heating mechanism since the ammonia molecule is easily photo - dissociated by ultraviolet radiation .",
    "the small column densities of warm dust in these clouds also points to a mechanical heating mechanism ( martn - pintado et al .",
    "1999 ) .    on the other hand , in some of the clouds we have detected line emission from ionized species like , or , that should arise in an region ionized by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons ( martn - pintado et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "this implies that , at least in those clouds , there must be a pdr in the interface between the region and the molecular material .",
    "large scale emission of the @xmath0  @xmath39=10 s(1 ) line has also been interpreted as arising from pdrs of density @xmath40  and incident far - uv flux of @xmath41 ( in units of 1.610@xmath42 ergs  ) in the clouds surfaces ( pak , jaffe & keller 1996 ) .",
    "the total visual extinction of @xmath20 30 mag derived for the clouds of our sample matches the expected _ foreground _ extinction and suggest that the pure - rotational @xmath0   emission could also arise in the surfaces of the clouds as the ro - vibrational lines .",
    "we have compared the population diagrams obtained for the gc clouds with the same type of diagrams predicted by models of c - shocks , j - shocks and pdrs .",
    "figure  [ fig_exc]a shows the comparison between the predictions of a c - shock from draine et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , a j - shock from hollenbach @xmath22 mckee ( @xcite ) , and the data for .",

    ", one finds that the agreement is excellent for the s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines but it is not so good for the lowest lines , even taking into account the non - equilibrium otp ratio found in ngc 7023 .",
    "in particular , the gc clouds exhibit more emission in the lowest lines than expected from the pdr model for @xmath45 and @xmath46=10@xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0  @xmath39=10 s(1 ) intensity predicted by this pdr model is a factor of @xmath21 larger than observed by pak , jaffe & keller ( 1996 ) .",
    "this fact would imply that the vibrational line emission is more diluted in a 3@xmath47 beam than the pure - rotational lines in the sws beam or that the pdr models do not apply .    in any case",
    ", the observed curvature of the population diagrams seems to be in good agreement with the predicted temperature gradient in a pdr . in fig .",
    "[ fig_exc]b , we also show the population diagram one obtains integrating the @xmath0  emission in lte with the temperature and @xmath0  abundance profiles along the @xmath48=10@xmath49 and @xmath46=10@xmath13   pdr model of burton et al .",
    "the result differs from that of burton et al . in",
    "that we do not take into account any radiative pumping , which affects mainly to higher levels than those involved in the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines .",
    "althoght the gc emission is @xmath44 times larger , it is evident that the shape of the population diagram is very similar to that observed .    with regard to those sources where the s(4 ) and s(5 ) were not detected ,",
    "the upper limits imply that if they are pdr - excited the density must be somewhat lower than @xmath46=10@xmath13 , or if shock - excited , the shock velocity should be slightly lower than those of the models ploted in fig .",
    "[ fig_exc ] .",
    "both shock and pdr models suggest densities as high as @xmath50 and fail to explain the observed intensity of the s(0 ) emission and to less extend the s(1 ) line .",
    "the densities implied by the models seem somewhat large , but it looks like the @xmath0   traces two components : a hot ( @xmath1 k ) and dense ( @xmath50 ) component necessary to explain the observed s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines , and a warm component ( @xmath8 k ) traced by the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines . to match the measured /   @xmath3  and @xmath2   ratios the warm @xmath0   component should have densities of @xmath51   ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . the hot and dense gas would have /  @xmath3  ratios of @xmath52 but it would emit mainly in the high-@xmath53 co lines . in any case , the column density of hot and dense gas is very small to make it detectable in the low-@xmath53 co lines when mixed with the colder and less dense gas that dominates the emission of these lines .    to explain the derived @xmath54  k is necessary to invoke pdrs with @xmath41 and @xmath55  , but to obtain the observed intensities @xmath56 of such pdrs are needed .",
    "j - shock models do not predict temperatures as low as @xmath57  k. moreover , the high velocities required to explain our data are difficult to reconcile with the observations .",
    "c - shocks could explain the observed s(0 ) and s(1 ) emission with , at least , 10 shocks with velocities as low as @xmath58  and @xmath46=10@xmath13  ( even more shock fronts are needed for lower gas densities ) .",
    "in addition , dissipation of supersonic turbulence could heat the gas to temperatures of @xmath8 k ( wilson et al . @xcite ; gsten et al .",
    "@xcite ) and thus , could contribute to the emission in the two lowest @xmath0  lines .",
    "the origin of the turbulence would be the movement of dense clumps in a less dense inter - clump medium due to the differential galactic rotation and the tidal disruption of the clumps .",
    "the heating rate by dissipation of supersonic turbulence can be estimated as @xmath59 erg   ( black @xcite ) , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the spatial scale and the velocity of the turbulence , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath62   ( the typical linewidths of gc clouds ) , @xmath63  pc , and @xmath64  , one obtains @xmath65  erg . for the conditions of the warm gas ,",
    "@xmath66  k and @xmath67  , the cooling is expected to be dominated by @xmath0   and co. le bourlot et al .",
    "( @xcite ) has recently estimated the cooling rate by @xmath0   ( @xmath68 ) for a wide range of parameters .",
    "for the warm gas component of the gc clouds we obtain @xmath69 erg , which is comparable to the co cooling rate ( see e.g. goldsmith @xmath22 langer @xcite ) thus , comparing heating and cooling rates , one finds that the dissipation of supersonic turbulence could account for the heating of the warm component .    in summary , several agents could heat the warm component , while the hot component should trace the densest gas in the gc clouds heated by a pdr or a shock .",
    "for instance , if the inhomogeneous structure revealed in the sgr b2 envelope by interferometric  observations ( martn - pintado et al .",
    "1999 ) is common in the gc , and due to evolved massive stars as they propose , both c - shocks of @xmath21  ( shell expansion ) and pdrs ( stellar radiation ) would be present . however , it is not possible to rule out mechanical heating by large scale shocks .",
    "in fact , the high fraction of warm @xmath0  derived for m@xmath37  and the fact that the co component with positive velocities apparently does not contribute to the @xmath0  emission suggests this kind of heating since , at this galactic longitude , shocks are expected at negative velocities due to the intersection of @xmath70 and @xmath71 orbits in the context of a barred potential ( binney et al .",
    "we have observed the s(0 ) to s(5 ) @xmath0  pure - rotational lines with the sws spectrometer on - board iso toward a sample of 18 molecular clouds of the galactic center region .",
    "the s(3 ) line is strongly affected by dust extinction due to the 9.7 @xmath72 m band of the silicates . after correcting the @xmath0  data for extinction using a self - consistent method , and assuming that the ortho- and para-@xmath0  populations are in equilibrium one finds that the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines indicate temperatures of @xmath8 k. extrapolating to the lowest levels at that temperature , a total @xmath0  column density of @xmath73  is derived .",
    "this is the first direct estimate of the column density of warm gas in the gc clouds .",
    "in addition , it shows a complex temperature structure of the warm gas .",
    "the temperature derived from the s(5 ) and s(4 ) levels is @xmath9 k in the sources in which it can be derived , however the column density of gas at this temperature is less than @xmath74 of the column density at @xmath7=150  k. assuming an otp ratio of @xmath75 the temperatures would be @xmath76 larger than those derived assuming a lte otp ratio , while the total @xmath0  column densities at those temperatures would be a factor of @xmath77 lower than the column densities derived assuming the ortho- and para-@xmath0  populations in equilibrium . comparing the @xmath0  warm column densities with the column densities derived from our co data by lvg calculations one finds that the average fraction of warm @xmath0to the gas observed in co is @xmath78 . with our data and the  observations of httemeister",
    "et al . ( 1993 ) we derive relatively high  abundances of a few 10@xmath79 in both the warm and the cold components .",
    "several indirect arguments point to shocks as the heating mechanism of the warm gas but pdrs may also play a role .",
    "direct comparison of the @xmath0  data with pdrs and shocks models indicate that the s(4 ) and s(5 ) trace the densest gas in the gc clouds ( 10@xmath13 ) heated in pdrs or shocks .",
    "nevertheless , such dense pdrs or shocks fail to explain the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines : several less dense pdrs , low velocity shocks ( @xmath80  ) or both along the line of sight would be needed to explain the observed emission .    the cooling by @xmath0   in the warm component of gc clouds is comparable to the cooling by co. equating the @xmath0   cooling rate with the heating rate by dissipation of supersonic turbulence , one finds that this mechanism could also contribute to the emission in the two lowest @xmath0   lines . in one source ( m@xmath37 ) , we have also found some evidence of large scale shocks that should be checked with higher spectral resolution @xmath0  observations .",

    "<S> we present iso observations of several @xmath0  pure - rotational lines ( from s(0 ) to s(5 ) ) towards a sample of 16 molecular clouds distributed along the central @xmath1 pc of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we also present @xmath2  and @xmath3   and  observations of these sources made with the iram-30 m telescope . with the co data we derive @xmath0  densities of 10@xmath4  and @xmath0column densities of a few 10@xmath5  . </S>",
    "<S> we have corrected the @xmath0   data for @xmath6 magnitudes of visual extinction using a self - consistent method . in every source </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the @xmath0  emission exhibits a large temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines trace temperatures ( @xmath7 ) of @xmath8  k while the s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines indicate temperatures of @xmath9  k. the warm @xmath0  column density is typically @xmath10  , and is predominantly gas with @xmath7=150 k. this is the first direct estimate of the total column density of the warm molecular gas in the galactic center region . </S>",
    "<S> these warm @xmath0  column densities represent a fraction of @xmath11 of the gas traced by the co isotopes emission . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling by @xmath0   in the warm component is comparable to that by co. comparing our @xmath0  and co data with available ammonia ( ) observations from literature one obtains relatively high  abundances of a few @xmath12 in both the warm and the cold gas . </S>",
    "<S> a single shock or photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) can not explain all the observed @xmath0  lines . </S>",
    "<S> alternatives for the heating mechanisms are discussed . </S>"
