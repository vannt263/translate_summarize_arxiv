    "though being on the market for more than thirty years , the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite still provides one of the most viable extensions of the standard model ( sm ) and , surprisingly enough , the activity in this field seems to grow in the last decade  see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "it earns its popularity namely because of its capability to incorporate many sources of physics beyond sm @xcite , be it the cp - violation in the higgs sector , additional contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon or simply the fact that the two higgs doublet structure with 5 massive physical states ( and at least one around the weak scale ) mimics nicely many features of the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) . on top of that , as we shall see , the higgs sector of thdm can exhibit some particular features which are completely absent in mssm , namely the relatively large nondecoupling effects of the heavy higgs bosons @xcite which can arise once the heavy higgs spectrum is sufficiently nondegenerate .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect2 ] we present a general systematic discussion of the origin of various nondecoupling effects and the connection of their magnitude with the parameters of the higgs potential and the shape of the heavy higgs spectrum .    in sections",
    "[ sect3 ] and [ sect4 ] we use these results to estimate quantitatively the scale of the effects in question in the physical process of particular interest , namely @xmath1 .",
    "we thus extend the earlier analysis of s.  kanemura et al .",
    "@xcite based on the equivalence theorem ( et ) for longitudinal vector bosons @xcite , valid in the large @xmath2 limit . having in hand the results of our previous works @xcite and @xcite in which we discussed the nondecoupling structures arising in the one - loop triple gauge vertices of thdm we can go far beyond the et approximation .",
    "section [ sect5 ] is devoted to several quantitative illustrations of the typical behaviour of the relevant cross sections both in the decoupling and the nondecoupling regimes , in full agreement with the estimates .",
    "adopting the notation of @xcite the most general form of the thdm higgs potential reads @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6          ( \\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)+ { \\rm h.c.}\\right\\}\\ ] ] here the @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two @xmath9 doublets with the same sm - like hypercharges .",
    "the neutral components of both of them can develop nonzero vevs around the weak scale and break the electroweak symmetry downto the electromagnetic @xmath10 in the usual manner .",
    "the massive higgses @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as the goldstone bosons @xmath15 and @xmath16 are then encoded within these doublets as @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "let us inspect the general formulae for the physical higgs masses descending from the potential ( [ potential ] ) : @xmath27\\nonumber \\\\ m_{h^0}^2 & = & \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\kappa)m^2+\\frac{v^2}{\\cos 2\\alpha } \\times \\nonumber   \\\\ & & \\times \\left[a_2\\cos^2 \\beta -b_1\\sin^2 \\beta - \\frac{1}{4}c ( 1-\\cos 2\\alpha \\cos 2\\beta)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ m_{a^0}^2 & = & m^2 -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2\\lambda_5^r+\\lambda_6^r\\cot\\beta + \\lambda_7^r\\tan \\beta\\right ) v^2   \\\\ m_{h^\\pm}^2 & = & m^2 -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\lambda_4+\\lambda_5^r+\\lambda_6^r\\cot\\beta + \\lambda_7^r\\tan\\beta\\right ) v^2 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 notice that the two mass parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 were as usual fixed by the necessary conditions for the vevs of @xmath31 and @xmath32 to minimize the potential . for @xmath33 one recovers the formulae given previously in the literature , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein .    let us call by _ heavy higgs mass limit _ the situation , in which the masses of all the thdm higgs bosons but @xmath34 are much larger than the weak scale .",
    "one can see that there are in general two basic quantities responsible for the shape of the higgs spectrum ( [ masses ] ) : the gauge singlet mass parameter @xmath35 ( alias @xmath36 ) and the vev magnitude @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath35 is not protected by the gauge symmetry it could be naturally much larger than @xmath37 and in such case the heavy higgs mass limit is achieved entirely by enlarging @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are unitarity bounds on the masses of the heavy members of the higgs spectrum preventing them to be extremely heavy @xcite . moreover , the @xmath37 is often accompained by ( in principle ) numerically large factors @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 which enhances some of the @xmath40 terms obviating to large extent the necessity of having a dominant @xmath35 to achieve the heavy higgs mass limit .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the situation in the mssm where only one free parameter @xmath41 is left to play with , because the quartic couplings in the higgs potential are fixed by supersymmetry .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to distinguish between two different modes in which the heavy part of the higgs spectrum acquires the masses :    * if it is due to the dominance of the singlet mass terms ( @xmath35-components ) in the relations ( [ masses ] ) let us call it _ the decoupling regime_. perhaps it is worth noting that although the only explicit mass present in ( [ masses ] ) is @xmath36 one should not forget about @xmath42 and @xmath43 that are hidden in particular combinations of the other parameters in the game which can to some extent mimic their role unless @xmath44 ( see also comments in section [ sect5 - 2 ] ) . *",
    "the contributions coming from the @xmath35 components are comparable with the other @xmath40 parts in ( [ masses ] ) ; such situation is called _ the nondecoupling regime_.    as the terminology suggests , in the decoupling regime the heavy higgs bosons exhibit a decoupling behaviour in accordance with the famous appelquist - carazzone theorem @xcite . in this case",
    "one can easily show that the requirement of coincidence of the thdm @xmath34 with the sm higgs boson @xmath45 ( with masses not far from @xmath46 ) and the relation ( [ cosbetaalpha ] ) lead to @xmath47 and therefore _ the heavy higgs spectrum is quasidegenerate @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50_.    on the other hand , in the nondecoupling regime _ the heavy higgs spectrum should be distorted _ and one can in principle expect substantial effects in measurable quantities which should grow with the weights of the @xmath40 terms in ( [ masses ] ) , i.e. with the magnitude of such a distortion .",
    "this was used as a nontrivial consistency check of the numerical results we present below . from this point of view",
    "the behaviour of the heavy higgs bosons in the mssm is very simple in comparison with thdm ; in fact , in mssm there is no such nondecoupling regime and all the heavy higgses therein should therefore tend to decouple from the weak scale physics .",
    "this was confirmed explicitly in @xcite .",
    "this can be used e.g. as a simple heuristic explanation of what happens in @xcite and @xcite , where the considered non - decoupling effects of the heavy part of the higgs spectrum tend to minimize provided a partial degeneration in the heavy higgs sector is achieved ( @xmath51 ) .    in the remaining part of the paper",
    "we demonstrate these principles in the particular case of physical cross - sections of the process @xmath52 computed within the thdm framework at one - loop order in comparison with the sm predictions .",
    "we generalize the earlier work @xcite beyond the et approximation used therein . among other things ,",
    "our approach allows one to consider general configurations of polarizations of the final state vector bosons .",
    "since the one - loop form of the differential cross - section within the sm is very well known @xcite , we can use the similarity of thdm to simplify our life by dealing with the pieces of information which are specific for thdm , namely the contributions to the one - loop amplitude and the bremsstrahlung terms that are different for thdm and sm .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to work with a quantity that measures just the deviation of the thdm and sm cross sections under consideration @xcite ; let us define it as @xmath54 both differential cross section in the last expression can be written as @xmath55 where the pieces @xmath56 come from the amplitude - squared terms @xmath57 while the @xmath58 terms represent the bremsstrahlung effects @xmath59 expanding now the thdm amplitude around the corresponding sm form @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 are just the differences of the tree- and one - loop amplitudes respectively ) one can recast the @xmath63 as @xmath64+\\ ] ] @xmath65 here the @xmath66 are @xmath67 geometrical factors and the integration over @xmath68 covers the ir - singular piece of the phase space spanned by the photon momenta .",
    "let us first explore the bremsstrahlung terms in ( [ firststage ] ) . using the identity @xmath69 we see that the only terms that survive ( i.e. those that are not common to both thdm and sm ) come from the graphs ( @xmath70 denotes the generic neutral higgses in the game ) : @xmath71 these diagrams are necessary to regulate the singular infrared behaviour of @xmath56 caused by the presence of @xmath72 all the above graphs are ir singular but the divergences cancel in the physical cross - section formulae and once we specify the ir regulator scale they provide just logarithmic corrections to @xmath73 .",
    "as we shall see , the presence of the electron yukawa coupling makes these terms suppressed by factors of the order of @xmath74 with respect to the leading contributions to @xmath63 coming from the ir - regular terms in @xmath56 .",
    "thus , in the leading approximation we can omit the bremsstrahlung effects entirely .",
    "this means that we can forget about the second term of the expansion ( [ firststage ] ) and also keep only the ir - regular subset of graphs corresponding to @xmath75 , which we shall denote by @xmath76 .",
    "next , it is worth noting that the @xmath61 in ( [ firststage ] ) also suffers of the omnipresent electron yukawa coupling which again makes it much smaller in comparison with the leading loop contributions to @xmath77 coming ( as we shall see ) from the renormalization of the triple gauge vertices ( tgv ) . to conclude ,",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath63 can be written in the form @xmath78",
    "thus , all we need is only the sum of all the ir - safe one - loop diagrams which are not shared by the thdm and sm , i.e. those loop graphs which contain at least one higgs propagator .",
    "we have decided to use the on - shell renormalization scheme @xcite in which the renormalized masses parametrizing the one - loop quantities coincide with the physical masses of the fields in the game ; this simplifies greatly the interpretation of various limits under consideration ( in particular , we use the set of counterterms defined in @xcite ) . at first glance",
    ", it might seem that this also obviates the necessity to deal with the renormalization of the external legs of feynman graphs .",
    "in fact , this is not true because in the on - shell scheme nontrivial finite parts of various counterterms reappear and these bring back the self - energy diagrams .",
    "we will work in the feynman ( @xmath80 ) gauge to have the ivb propagators as simple as possible .",
    "this of course requires to take into account also the unphysical goldstone bosons .",
    "note that there is no need to take care about the ghost fields ( which do not decouple from the higgs sector unless @xmath81 ) because all the relevant topologies contributing to @xmath82 containing the ghost loop involve also the yukawa couplings ( 1-loop irreducible graphs ) or do not contribute substantially ( oblique corrections ) .",
    "let us first classify the topologies of feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath82 that do not subtract trivially in ( [ delta ] ) , i.e. those that are not common to the two models . in what follows , the symbol @xmath83 denotes a loop involving at least one higgs propagator while @xmath84 is used for loops built entirely from the other sm fields . in both cases also",
    "the corresponding counterterms must be taken into account .    concerning the tree - level origin of the the relevant one - loop graphs one can identify several subgroups of them , namely :    [ [ neutrino - in - the - t - channel ] ] neutrino in the @xmath85-channel : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath86    [ [ z - and - gamma - in - the - s - channel ] ] @xmath87 and @xmath88 in the @xmath2-channel : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath89    [ [ higgs - in - the - s - channel ] ] higgs in the @xmath2-channel : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93    [ [ box - diagrams ] ] box diagrams : + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath94 the total number of the graphs with the topologies displayed here is enormous .",
    "however , not all of them are relevant in the leading approximation .      as before , the presence of the electron yukawa couplings allows one to neglect all graphs of the types @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 in comparison with the types @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 where there is no such factor .",
    "next , the blob in the type @xmath107 provides just a correction to the yukawa vertex which is fixed by the renormalization conditions to be comparable with the yukawa coupling itself .",
    "the diagrams of type @xmath108 are again @xmath110 suppressed ; the electron mass here arises from the dirac equation .",
    "we are therefore left with the ivb vacuum polarization graphs in @xmath105 ( the oblique corrections to the ivb propagators ) , the corrections to the triple gauge vertices @xmath106 and the uv convergent box diagrams @xmath109 . however , among them only those involving the higgs bosons coupled to the ivb lines need to be taken into account , otherwise the small yukawa coupling reappears .",
    "next , since the boxes are uv - finite they must decouple trivially in the heavy higgs mass limit described above .",
    "all that remains at the leading order are therefore the graphs of the type @xmath111 that we shall treat separately .",
    "the renormalized inverse propagator of a massive vector boson is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the transverse and longitudinal projectors , @xmath115 is the sum of all relevant one - loop graphs , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the wave - function and mass counterterms and @xmath118 is the tree - level massive gauge boson propagator . in the on - shell scheme",
    "the counterterms are fixed by @xcite @xmath119 which yields @xmath120 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\delta m^2 & = & -m^4 { \\pi^t}'(m^2 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we do not need to deal with the longitudinal part of the renormalized ivb propagators because they typically produce the suppressing @xmath121 factors",
    ". we can also omit all tadpole diagrams : their contributions to @xmath122 are proportional to @xmath123 and therefore cancel ( as they should ) in @xmath124 and @xmath125 $ ] in @xmath126 .",
    "the remaining graphs are those appearing in the massive scalar electrodynamics .",
    "it is already easy to show that such contributions to @xmath63 fall rapidly in the heavy higgs mass limit regardless of the way the limit is achieved .",
    "concerning the differences of the heavy higgs corrections to the triple gauge vertices in thdm and in sm the major part of the work has already been done before @xcite , so let us mention just the important points .",
    "the differences of the relevant vertex functions can be written in the form @xmath127 where @xmath128 @xmath129 are basic kinematical structures composed of the outgoing momenta @xmath130 of the @xmath131 bosons in the final state .",

    "<S> we discuss the origin of the nondecoupling effects of the heavy higgs bosons within the two higgs doublet extension ( thdm ) of the standard model ( sm ) and illustrate it by means of the one - loop calculation of the differential cross - sections of the process @xmath0 in both the decoupling and the non - decoupling regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that there are many regions in the thdm parametric space in which the thdm and sm predictions differ by several percents and such effects could , at least in principle , be testable at the future experimental facilities . </S>"
