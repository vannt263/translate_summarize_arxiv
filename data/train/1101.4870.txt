    "experiments on cuprate superconductors have shown a nontrivial evolution of their fermi surface with hole doping @xmath0 . in the overdoped compound tl@xmath1ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 magnetoresistance measurements@xcite ,",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and quantum oscillation experiments@xcite show a fairly conventional fermi surface which is consistent with lda band structure calculations that take the cu3d electrons as itinerant and which covers a fraction of the brillouin zone of @xmath3 . in the underdoped compounds the situation is more involved .",
    "arpes shows ` fermi arcs'@xcite which however are probably just the intense part of hole pockets centered near @xmath4 .",
    "this is plausible because the sharp drop of the arpes weight of the quasiparticle band upon crossing the noninteracting fermi surface which must be invoked to reconcile the ` fermi arcs ' with the hole pocket scenario is actually well established in insulating cuprates such as sr@xmath1cu@xmath1o@xmath1cl@xmath1@xcite and ca@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1@xcite where this phenomenon has been termed the remnant fermi surface. moreover both the drude weight in la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7@xcite and yba@xmath1cu@xmath8o@xmath9@xcite as well as the inverse low temperature hall constant in la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7@xcite and yba@xmath1cu@xmath8o@xmath9@xcite scale with @xmath0 and the inferred band mass is constant troughout the underdoped regime and in fact even the antiferromagnetic phase@xcite .",
    "this would be a exactly the behaviour expected for hole pockets . on the other hand , for @xmath10 the hall constant in la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 changes rapidly , which suggests a change from hole pockets to a large fermi surface@xcite .",
    "quantum - oscillation experiments on underdoped yba@xmath1cu@xmath8o@xmath11@xcite and yba@xmath1cu@xmath7o@xmath12@xcite show that the fermi surface has a cross section that is comparable to @xmath13 rather than @xmath14 .",
    "thereby the mere validity of the fermi liquid description as evidenced by the quantum oscillations is clear evidence against the notion of ` fermi arcs ' : the defining property of a fermi liquid is the one - to - one correspondence of its low - lying states to those of a fictitious system of weakly interacting fermionic quasiparticles and the fermi surface of these quasiparticles is a constant energy contour of their dispersion and therefore necessarily a closed curve in @xmath15-space . on the other hand",
    "the quantum oscillations can not be viewed as evidence for hole pockets either in that both the hall constant@xcite and thermopower@xcite have a sign that would indicate electron pockets in the normal state induced by the high magnetic fields used in the quantum oscillation experiments . thereby both ,",
    "the hall constant and the thermopower , show a strong temperature dependence and in fact a sign change as a function of temperature . at the same time neutron scattering experiments on detwinned yba@xmath1cu@xmath8o@xmath16 in the superconducting state show anisotropy in the spin excitations spectrum below @xmath17 and at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this indicates a rather complicated reconstruction to take place , possibly to a ` nematic ' state with inequivalent @xmath18- and @xmath19-direction in the cuo@xmath1 plane .",
    "such a nematicity which is also apparent in scanning tunneling microscopy@xcite must modify the fermi surface in some way which may explain the unexpected sign .",
    "all in all the data may be interpreted as showing a change of the fermi surface volume at around optimal doping from a small fermi surface with a volume @xmath20 to a large one with volume @xmath21 .",
    "+ exact diagonalization studies of the t - j model have shown that the fermi surface at hole dopings @xmath22 takes the form of hole pockets@xcite , that the quasiparticles have the character of strongly renormalized spin polarons throughout this doping range@xcite and that the low energy spectrum at these doping levels can be described as a fermi liquid of spin @xmath23 quasiparticles corresponding to the doped holes@xcite .",
    "a comparison of the dynamical spin and density correlation function at low@xcite ( @xmath24 ) and intermediate and high ( @xmath25 ) hole doping moreover indicates@xcite that around optimal doping a phase transition takes place . in the underdoped regime spin and density correlation function differ strongly , with magnon - like spin excitations and extended incoherent continua in the density correlation function@xcite which can be explained quantitatively by a calculation in the spin - polaron formalism@xcite . at higher doping , spin and",
    "density correlation function become more and more similar and both approach the self - convolution of the single - particle green s function , whereby deviations from the self - convolution form can be explained as particle - hole excitations across a free electron - like fermi surface@xcite .",
    "we thus expect a transition between a low - doping phase with a hole - pocket fermi surface and quasiparticles which resemble the spin polarons realized at half - filling and a high doping phase with a free electron - like large fermi surface . here",
    "we want to further elucidate the issue of the fermi surface and the possible transition between the large and small fermi surfaces .",
    "to that end we study the electronic self - energy @xmath26 of the 2d hubbard model by exact diagonalization .",
    "we study the hubbard model on a two dimensional square lattice , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath27 here @xmath28 creates an electron with @xmath29-spin @xmath30 in the orbital at lattice site @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes a summation over all nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "we set @xmath33 and unless otherwise stated @xmath34 .",
    "the self - energy @xmath26 is defined by the dyson equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the free dispersion and @xmath37 is the single particle green s function at zero temperature@xcite . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the ground state wave function and energy with @xmath40 electrons . in the present study the green s function for finite clusters",
    "is evaluated numerically by means of the lanczos algorithm@xcite .",
    "+ luttinger@xcite has derived the following spectral representation of the self - energy : @xmath41 in other words @xmath26 is the sum of a real constant @xmath42 ( which is equal to the hartree - fock potential , see appendix a ) and a sum of poles on the real axis . in the thermodynamical limit",
    "there may be both isolated poles and continua of poles @xmath43 . in a finite system , however , the poles @xmath43 in principle always are discrete .",
    "since the real part of @xmath26 assumes any value in @xmath44 $ ] in between two successive poles , @xmath43 and @xmath45 it follows that the equation @xmath46 has exactly one solution in the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "if there is an energy interval with zero spectral weight - i.e. a gap - in the single particle spectral function it follows that there must be precisely one pole of the self - energy within in this gap .",
    "for example , the hubbard - i approximation@xcite for a nonmagnetic ground state corresponds to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of electrons / spin .",
    "this is a single @xmath15-independent pole of strength @xmath50 at approximately the center of the hubbard gap . in the neighborhood of a pole of @xmath26",
    "the real part of the self - energy takes the form @xmath51 on the real axis , where @xmath52 is slowly varying .",
    "if the residuum @xmath53 is large , the real part is large as well and no solution of @xmath54 exists close to the pole .",
    "an isolated pole with large residuum thus pushes open a gap of the spectral density in its neighborhood . on the other hand , if @xmath53 is small the real part will deviate from @xmath52 only in the immediate neighborhood of @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that the corresponding solution of @xmath54 is pinned near @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , close to @xmath43 the slope of the real part of the self - energy is large and negative , so that the spectral weight @xmath55 is small .",
    "this rule will be seen frequently in the numerical spectra : an isolated pole with large residuum opens a gap in the single - particle spectral function around itself , a pole with small residuum has a pole of the single - particle green s function with small weight in its immediate neighborhood .",
    "finally , we note that a ` band ' of poles of the self energy , i.e. @xmath43 with @xmath56 fixed , can never be crossed by a band of poles of the green s function .",
    "therefore , bands of isolated poles of @xmath26 define surfaces in the three - dimensional @xmath57-space which can not be crossed by quasiparticle bands in the green s function .",
    "the only exception would be a zero of the residuum , @xmath53 .",
    "+ as already mentioned we study the self - energy by computing the green s function of finite clusters by means of the lanczos algorithm .",
    "thereby we encounter a technical problem concerning the dimension of the hilbert space . in a @xmath58 cluster the dimension of the hilbert space at half - filling ( i.e. with @xmath59 electrons of either spin direction in the cluster ) is @xmath60 , in the half - filled 18-site cluster it is already @xmath61 .",
    "such large hilbert space dimensions make numerical calculations very difficult .",
    "by contrast , the dimension of the hilbert space of the heisenberg model - which is equivalent to the hubbard model for large @xmath62 - in the @xmath58 cluster is only @xmath63 , in the @xmath64-site cluster it is @xmath65 . the heisenberg model - and in the doped case the t - j model - thus are much easier to study numerically and in fact the largest cluster for which exact diagonalization studies for the hubbard model have been performed@xcite is @xmath58 , whereas larger clusters are possible for the t - j model . for a study of the self energy , however",
    ", the t - j model can not be used due to its ` projected ' nature which for example implies the absence of the upper hubbard band .",
    "+ on the other hand , various authors have derived effective hamiltonians which operate in the projected hilbert space of the t - j model but reproduce physical quantities of the hubbard model to order @xmath66@xcite . this is achieved by performing a canonical transformation which eliminates the part of the hopping term which creates / annihilates double occupancies .",
    "the crucial point thereby is that not only the hamiltonian itself , but all operators whose expectation values or correlation functions are to be calculated , have to be subject to this canonical transformation as well , which usually leads to correction terms of order @xmath66 in all operators@xcite .",
    "if this is done consistently , however , very accurate approximate spectra for the hubbard model can be calculated using ` t - j - sized ' hilbert spaces which allows to treat more clusters and thus obtain additional information@xcite . so far",
    "this procedure has been performed only for the lower hubbard band , because the study of the upper hubbard band in the doped case requires a considerable number of additional terms in the hamiltonian which describe the interaction between the doped holes and the double occupancy created in the inverse photoemission process@xcite . for the present study , however , the complete hamiltonian as given by eskes _",
    "et al._@xcite has been implemented as computer code .",
    "a brief outline of the procedure and expressions for the corrected photoemission and inverse photoemission operators are given in appendix b. this procedure allows to calculate approximate green s function for the hubbard model over the entire doping range and on all clusters for which t - j model calculations are possible .",
    "for all these systems we evaluated the single particle greens function ( [ green ] ) by the lanczos method and obtained the self - energy from ( [ self ] ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] compares the single particle spectral function @xmath69 for the true hubbard model and the strong coupling hamiltonian . while there are clearly some small differences the strong coupling model reproduces the spectral function of the hubbard model quite well .",
    "the deviations between the spectra calculated with the strong coupling model and the true hubbard model are of order @xmath70 for energies and @xmath71 for the weights .",
    "this property in fact can be used to check the correctness of the strong - coupling - code be comparing energies and weights of peaks at diferent @xmath62 .",
    "the agreement thus improves rapidly with decreasing @xmath66 and already for @xmath72 the spectra become essentially indistinguishable .",
    "it is therefore a useful check whether certain features of the spectra are robust with decreasing @xmath66 .",
    "lastly we mention that for the sake of analysis and extrapolation to the infinite lattice the energies @xmath43 and residua @xmath53 of some poles will frequently be expanded in terms of tight - binding harmonics of @xmath15 e.g. @xmath73 and similarly for the residua with coefficients @xmath74 .",

    "it may be that the dominant pole has a very rapid dispersion of its energy @xmath43 in the neighborhood of these momenta .",
    "a second possibility is that there are two poles with a smooth dispersion @xmath43 but rapidly varying @xmath53 .",
    "the peak at @xmath78 and @xmath83 would then belong to a second band of poles , which has appreciable residuum only near @xmath78 , whereas the residuum of the pole in the gap would suddenly drop to zero at @xmath78 .",
    "a calculation at @xmath72 shows , however , that the dispersion of the central pole including @xmath78 and @xmath79 is almost exactly the same , which makes the interpretation in terms of a single central pole with rapid dispersion near these momenta more plausible .",
    "+ to understand the meaning of this form of the self - energy let us consider a self energy with a single dispersive pole @xmath84 where the first term @xmath85 is the hartree potential at half - filling .",

    "in summary we have presented an exact diagonalization study of the self - energy @xmath26 in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "larger clusters than usual could be used because instead of studying the true hubbard model we considered its strong - coupling limit which requires much smaller hilbert spaces . for dopings less than 30% - i.e. the doping region in which cuprate",
    "superconductivity takes place - several distinct features can be identified : first , a pole with large residuum @xmath126 and a dispersion of width @xmath127 in the center of the hubbard gap , which is present throughout this doping range .",
    "second , a pole with smaller residuum and an upward dispersion @xmath128 around @xmath78 which is present only in the underdoped regime . and third , several broad incoherent continua of width @xmath127 . the top of the lowest of these incoherent continua may be formed by a third pole . all features in the spectral representation of @xmath26 show a pronounced @xmath15-dependence , both with respect to their dispersion and their residuum .",
    "this implies that in real space the self - energy is long - ranged and oscillatory .",
    "+ the key difference between the underdoped and overdoped system is the presence of a dispersive pole of @xmath26 around @xmath78 .",
    "this pole cuts through the quasiparticle dispersion and changes the fermi surface topology completely . in the underdoped hole concentration range",
    "the fermi surface takes the form of a ` hole ring ' for @xmath129 or hole pockets centered near @xmath4 for @xmath130 and changes to a large free - electron - like fermi surface in the overdoped case .",
    "we have shown that the hole pockets can be completely consistent with the luttinger theorem .",
    "the residuum of the upward dispersing pole near @xmath78 thus plays the role of an order parameter for the phase transition between the two different ground states .",
    "+ the single - particle spectra obtained with the fitted self - energies agree very well with both quantum monte carlo simulations ( for @xmath129 ) and arpes on underdoped cuprates ( for @xmath131 ) .",
    "in particular the spectra reproduce a hole - pocket - like fermi surface of similar shape and location as in experiment and also the characteristic strong asymmetry of the spectral weight of the parts of the pocket facing @xmath79 and @xmath78 . quite generally ,",
    "the spectra show that all parts of the quasiparticle band which deviate from the noninteracting electron band structure have a very small weight .",
    "the reason is that these band portions closely follow the dispersion of a band of poles of @xmath26 and ` borrow ' their spectral weight from the quasiparticle band .",
    "the data suggest in particular that some fermi level crossings observed in arpes along the line @xmath118 actually may not be true fermi level crossings but sharp bends at the intersection of the quasiparticle dispersion and a band of poles in @xmath26 .",
    "an example where such pseudo - crossings can be clearly recognized is la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7@xcite . in this compound",
    "the shift the quasiparticle band is sufficiently far from @xmath112 near @xmath117 so that the absence of a fermi level crossing is clear - if the quasiparticle band is closer to @xmath112 , however , there pseudo - crossing may well be mistaken for a real fermi level crossing . + an interesting question is the physical meaning of the upwards dispersing pole near @xmath78 .",
    "one immediate consequence of this pole is that the part of the inverse photoemission spectrum belonging to the lower hubbard band consists of two disconneted components .",
    "the first component is the unoccupied part of the quasiparticle band , which forms the cap of the hole - pockets around @xmath4 , the second component is a disconnected part around @xmath78 .",
    "this two - component nature of the inverse phtoemission spectrum was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the disconnected component around @xmath78 actually consists of spin - polaron shakeoff , i.e. spin excitations which are released when a hole dressed by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations is filled by an electron .",
    "the disconnected nature of the low energy inverse photoemission spectrum thus is a quite natural consequence of the hole pockets and the spin - polaron nature of the quasiparticles .",
    "+ the transition then may be understood as follows : in a mott insulator the electrons are localized and retain only their spin degrees of freedom . upon doping most electrons are still tightly surrounded by other electrons as in the insulator and thus remain localized - the ground state wave function therefore should optimize the energy gain due to delocalization of the holes and since the holes are spin-1/2 fermions this can be achieved by forming hole pockets with a volume @xmath132 around the ground state momentum of a single hole i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "this picture leads to a simple theory@xcite in which the number of noninteracting particles is equal to the number of doped holes .",
    "+ when the density of holes becomes sufficiently large so that the electrons are sufficiently mobile a phase transition occurs to a state which optimizes the kinetic energy of the electrons themselves and this means the formation of a fermi surface with a volume @xmath133 .",
    "a rough estimate for the hole concentration where the transition occurs would be @xmath134 with @xmath29 the coordination number because then each electron has one unoccupied neighbor on the average .",
    "the vanishing of the upward dispersing pole in the self - energy then corresponds to this phase transition .",
    "experimentally it seems that the phase transition between pockets and free - electron - like fermi surface occurs right at optimal doping .",
    "this suggests that superconductivity is also related to this transition .",

    "<S> we present an exact diagonalization study of the self - energy of the two - dimensional hubbard model . to increase the range of available cluster sizes we use a corrected t - j model to compute approximate greens functions for the hubbard model . </S>",

    "<S> the self - energy has several ` bands ' of poles with strong dispersion and extended incoherent continua with k - dependent intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the self - energy by a minimal model and use this to extrapolate the cluster results to the infinite lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fermi surface shows a transition from hole pockets in the underdoped regime to a large fermi surface in the overdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that hole pockets can be completely consistent with the luttinger theorem . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of next - nearest neighbor hopping changes the self - energy stronlgy and the spectral function with nonvanishing next - nearest - neighbor hopping in the underdoped region is in good agreement with angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy . </S>"
