    "an important observable for studying high energy collisions is the momentum correlation between emitted mesons . in the statistical limit",
    "the correlation function depends on the bose symmetry of the particles as in the hanbury - brown  twiss ( hbt ) analysis of photon correlations from stars ( for a review see @xcite ) . under the statistical assumptions , the meson correlation directly measures the size of the meson interaction zone , and",
    "thus indirectly reflects the hadronic dynamics prior to the meson freeze - out .",
    "in particular , the correlation between pions and between kaons has been analyzed to give quantitative data on the mean square source dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis is dependent on the statistical assumptions , raising the question of their validity under realistic conditions of meson production . in this work",
    "we develop a simple model of meson production to test the hbt analysis . within this model",
    "we can also examine the concept of a classical source . before defining the model , we shall briefly review the hbt analysis to establish the notation .",
    "the basic observables are the one- and two - particle differential cross sections , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , within some class of events . writing the cross section for these events as @xmath2",
    ", we define the doubles - to - singles correlation function as @xcite    @xmath3    the three - vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the three - momenta of the two mesons . to facilitate later on the interpretation of the correlation function , we chose the arguments to be the average and relative momentum , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .    in the theoretical model",
    ", it will be more convenient to express the correlation function using decay rates rather than cross sections .",
    "the rates are related to cross sections by a flux factor . in terms of the total decay rate @xmath8 and the differential decay rates",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 , we evaluate the doubles - to - singles correlation function as @xmath11    to allow an hbt analysis of @xmath12 , we have to make statistical assumptions ( explained in the next section ) that reduce the information contained in the two - particle quantities to that contained in the density matrix for a single particle source . the latter is conveniently expressed in the wigner representation as the ( one - particle ) phase space distribution @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy of the meson .",
    "the connection to the correlation function is given by pratt s formula @xcite , which we will derive in the next section .",
    "the formula reads @xmath15 we use a notation here with four - vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "to separate on - shell from off - shell four - momenta we use the notation @xmath18 in the on - shell case , where @xmath19 is the energy of a meson with momentum @xmath20 and mass @xmath21 .",
    "we have also defined the relative and the average four - momenta of the two mesons , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    to compare with theoretical expectations , it is common to model the evolution of the interacting hadronic system using classical transport equations @xcite . with these simulations",
    "one can predict a classical source distribution function , @xmath24 . note that the energy is not an independent variable in the classical source .",
    "thus in principle there is not enough information to use @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i:1 ] ) , since the required @xmath26 in that equation need not have the energy on mass shell . however , in favorable cases the extrapolation off mass shell will not cause difficulties",
    ".    we shall also find it useful to analyze the correlation data by dividing the two - particle distribution function by the unsymmetrized two - particle distribution .",
    "this is defined @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the two - particle decay rate in the absence of bose correlations .",
    "these correlations are not present for pairs of unlike mesons , so one could imagine measuring @xmath29 by e.g. comparing the correlation between pairs of @xmath30 mesons to the correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we therefore shall call this the like - to - unlike correlation . however , although the bose interference is absent from the unlike decay distribution , the interaction between unlike mesons induces stronger correlations than for charged mesons of like sign .",
    "another approach to measure @xmath28 is to try to extract it from the correlated data by expressing the rate as a sum of two terms , one the uncorrelated product of two single - particle decays , and the other the correlation .",
    "this has been done in some experimental data analyses @xcite .",
    "we will see in this work that it is easier to satisfy the statistical assumptions for the like - to - unlike ratio than for the ratio of doubles to singles .",
    "the basic formula for the correlation function in terms of the wigner distribution of the source , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pratt ] ) , was derived by pratt assuming an ensemble of classical currents .",
    "we will only use quantum mechanical amplitudes , as for example calculated from feynman diagrams , as it is useful to see what assumptions are necessary to derive the formula from such quantum mechanical expressions .",
    "our starting point is the symmetrized amplitude @xmath32 that describes the production of two identical mesons with momentum @xmath33 and @xmath34 in some reaction .",

    "we separate these variables into three sets @xmath37 as follows . in the unsymmetrized amplitude @xmath38 the label @xmath39 denotes the variables that directly influence the production of the meson with momentum @xmath33 , the label @xmath40 the ones that influence the meson with momentum @xmath34 , whereas @xmath41 denotes all other variables in the final state .    up to a possible overall sign",

    "( [ eq:6 ] ) is just the unsymmetrized total decay rate .",
    "we thus find for this correlation function @xmath57    to get an expression for the correlation function in terms of one - particle quantities ( c.f .",
    "( [ eq : pratt ] ) ) the two - particle wigner function must be factorized into one - particle functions .",
    "this demands a number of assumptions .",
    "in particular , we require that :    * the unsymmetrized t - matrix factorizes @xmath58 this condition can be fulfilled if the production process is dominated by tree graphs . however , this is not enough to factorize eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) , because the @xmath59-function still couples the @xmath39 and @xmath40 subsystems .",
    "so we also assume that : * the summation over the @xmath41 degrees of freedom serves as a heat bath that effectively decouples the other two subsystems .    under these two conditions",
    "the two - particle wigner function no longer depends explicitly on the energy and momentum of the initial state but depends on the statistical distribution of energy provided by the integration over @xmath41 . in effect , a microcanonical ensemble is replaced by a canonical ensemble characterized by a temperature in the center - of - mass frame @xmath60 we defined @xmath61 to be the energy for the degrees of freedom @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the energy of a meson with momentum @xmath64 .",
    "we label the corresponding wigner functions @xmath65 , i.e. , @xmath66 then under ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) the two - particle wigner function factorizes as @xmath67    the requirements ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) correspond to the usually cited assumption that the meson field is _ chaotic _ ,",
    "i.e. , the mesons are created independently . under these conditions",
    "we can now identify the like - to - unlike correlation function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : l / u ] ) , with pratt s expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pratt ] ) .",
    "however , the two conditions above do not suffice to rewrite the doubles - to - singles correlation function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : d / s ] ) , in the same way .",
    "in addition we have to require that :    * the one - particle decay rate can be calculated neglecting the symmetrization of the amplitude .    as",
    "this assumption is independent of ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) we can state it in terms of the microcanonically calculated function as defined below eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) @xmath68 a further consequence of ( a3 ) is that the total decay rate @xmath69 can be determined neglecting symmetrization as well , i.e ,",
    "it is usually assumed that this condition is fulfilled if typical momenta of the participating particles are large compared to the inverse size of the system , i.e. , that the emission processes are sufficiently localized in the emission volume .",
    "this condition , however , can be misleading .",

    "( [ eq : pratt ] ) .",
    "in this section we will describe a simple model that we use to test how well the assumptions ( a1)-(a3 ) can be fulfilled in a quantum mechanical calculation of meson production by resonance decay .",
    "the model is based on a picture of a small source that emits heavy particles .",
    "these undergo a cascade of decays to reach the final state .",
    "this picture is a plausible one for the decay of the concentrated high energy zone produced by nucleon - antinucleon annihilation or by @xmath71-@xmath72 annihilation at high energy .",
    "the mesonic source would have a spatial extension depending on the initial size of the state and the distance the resonances propagate . in heavy ion collisions , an additional mechanism extending",
    "the source is the rescattering of mesons in the later stages of the evolution . in our model",
    ", we will permit only the resonance propagation to contribute to the classical source size .",
    "the model is thus quite unrealistic for the heavy ion studies , but the criteria we develop have a more general validity .",
    "we will further simplify the resonance cascade process to the feynman graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . here",
    "an excitation having definite energy and momentum decays into two resonances and @xmath73 additional particles .",
    "each resonance propagates and emits a meson into the final state . only the two mesons are observed ; the other particles will be integrated out in calculating the differential decay rates .",
    "note that this graph satisfies the condition ( a1 ) with the three sets of quantum numbers given by the momenta @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and the set @xmath76 .    for computational convenience",
    "we assume that all unobserved particles have the same mass @xmath77 , and ignore effects of symmetry among the unobserved particles .",
    "we further assume that we can treat the heavy particles nonrelativistically .",

    "the intermediate resonances are assumed to be represented by simple resonance energy denominators of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the difference between resonance mass and the mass of the unobserved particle in the final state .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 is the width of the resonance . in principle",
    ", the coupling constants should be such that the decay rates are consistent with the assumed widths , but since the absolute decay rates play no role we shall ignore this requirement and choose the coupling constant being one .",
    "the couplings at the vertices will be taken as point - like , since we are ignoring finite sizes of the initial source and of the particles .",
    "the meson - production vertices contribute factors of @xmath83 in the perturbation theory .",
    "for the numerical calculations , we choose parameters to correspond to the @xmath84 meson , emitted from the @xmath85 resonance of the nucleon .",
    "accordingly , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "however , note that our assumption of constant form factors corresponds to an s - wave rather than the physical p - wave character of the @xmath85 resonance .",
    "finally , we will consider only one spatial dimension in the remainder of this work .",

    "( [ eq:37a ] ) the resonance lifetime @xmath183 is replaced by an effective lifetime @xmath184 , with a suitable averaging over an ensemble of resonances with different @xmath185 s .",
    "we have studied a resonance decay model to test the statistical assumptions behind the hbt analysis of meson correlations .",
    "one set of assumptions gives rise to a reduction of the unsymmetrized two - particle source function to a product of two single - particle thermal sources .",
    "we find that it is not too difficult to realize conditions that substantially satisfy this statistical assumption .",
    "the usual hbt analysis requires , however , that the single - particle distribution be calculable from an unsymmetrized two - particle source , and this condition is much more difficult to fulfill .    for resonance decays , we can ask whether the correlation reflects the spatial propagation of the resonances before they decay .",
    "we find that the apparent source size extracted from the quantum mechanically calculated correlation function deviates strongly from the classical mean square size even for resonance parameters and temperatures that suggest a classical behavior .",
    "the off - shell propagation of resonances is important and needs to be taken account of in the classical propagation if extracted source sizes are to make sense .",
