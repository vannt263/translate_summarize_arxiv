    "the subarcsecond vla and pdbi images of the high - j so@xmath3 lines have revealed the presence of a hot core heated by a yso and a rotating disk around the hw2 jet .",
    "furthermore , the 7@xmath2 mm and 3.6@xmath2 cm radiocontinuum images show free - free emission at the south - west cavity of the disk suggesting that it is photoevaporating @xcite .",

    "most of these objects are very distant , making it difficult to resolve the neutral disk and the ionized flow produced by the photoevaporation .",
    "so far , only mwc@xmath2349 has been studied in some detail from recombination line masers @xcite .",
    "however , mwc@xmath2349 is a rather evolved object which does not show the highly collimated jet but only the low velocity outflow .",

    "furthermore , the rate of ionizing photons derived for the central star is consistent with a b0.5 star with @xmath020@xmath2m@xmath10 .",
    "recent non - keplerian disk models show that small deviations from the keplerian rotation in a disk at the early stages of its formation , properly fit the molecular and continuum emission observed in low mass stars , avoiding the underestimation of the central source mass due to the keplerian law assumption @xcite .",
    "non - keplerian rotation could be the explanation of the relatively small mass derived for the powering source of the hw2 jet .",
    "our images show that the hot core is an independent object located in the vicinity of hw2 .",
    "in addition to the hot core , we have also detected low velocity ( blue - shifted ) so@xmath3 emission 0.3@xmath1 east of the hot core .",
    "high angular interferometric sio images have shown low velocity gas ( red- and blue - shifted ) in the surroundings of the hot core along the southeast - northwest direction @xcite .",
    "in particular , the location of the low velocity so@xmath3 emission coincides with the blue - lobe of the small - scale sio outflow @xcite , supporting the idea that this so@xmath3 emission is shocked gas associated with the east - west outflow seen in co @xcite and likely driven by the protostar associated with the hot core .",
    "the detection of a circumstellar disk around the hw2 radio jet in a cluster of massive stars favors the hypothesis of accretion of material through a circumstellar disk for the formation of these objects @xcite .",
    "this is expected since the cepheus a hw2 region is a relatively low density cluster .",
    "however , in high density clusters , it may not be unlikely that massive stars form through the coalescence of low mass stars as proposed by @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our subarcsecond images have resolved for the first time the hot gas surrounding the cepheus a hw2 massive star cluster .",
    "a rotating disk of radius 300@xmath2au and a mass of 1@xmath2m@xmath10 is photoevaporating by the central uv photons of the powering source of the hw2 radio jet .",
    "our vla images also resolve the nearby hot core associated with an intermediate mass star .",
    "this object is independent from the central source of the hw2 jet , and powers the east - west outflow found in the region .",
