    "heavy - fermion metals typically contain magnetic 4@xmath2 or 5@xmath2 elements ( _ e.g. _ ce , yb or u ) which give rise to magnetism of local moment character . at low temperatures",

    "the properties of these metals can often be described , according to landau @xcite , by considering quasi - particles made up of the electrons and their interactions  instead of the mere electrons  within the theory of a free electron gas . on the other hand , in many of these materials an indirect exchange coupling between the local magnetic moments",
    "is found ( the so - called rkky interaction ) which is also mediated  just like the aforementioned kondo interaction  via the conduction electrons .",
    "these two interactions are in direct competition .",
    "the relative strength of these two competing interactions can be tuned by experimental parameters such as chemical substitution , pressure and magnetic field . in case of this competition being",
    "adequately balanced a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) at @xmath3 0 can be brought about by a well - directed change of these experimental parameters @xcite .    once the kondo and rkky interactions are well balanced additional , smaller energy scales may play a decisive role .",
    "in fact , in many cases superconductivity is observed in close proximity to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , _ i.e. _ the point in phase space at which a continuous qpt occurs @xcite .",
    "possibly , superconductivity is one way of disposing the huge entropy accumulated in the vicinity of a qcp .",
    "this concept has been generalized @xcite such that possibly even in the copper - oxide materials superconductivity might be related to a hidden qcp . here",
    "it should be noted that superconductivity for which such a scenario is discussed is commonly considered to be of unconventional nature , in a sense that the standard bcs theory employing phonon - mediated cooper pair formation @xcite can not be applied .    in this context",

    "we report on structural investigations by both , enhanced - resolution x - ray diffraction experiments as well as atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) on single crystals of ceirin@xmath1 and cecoin@xmath1 .",
    "these measurements indicate the existence of a certain type of local structural features in the tetragonal hocoga@xmath1-type matrix that can directly be visualized by stm .",
    "these features can be considered as patches of the closely related tlaspd@xmath1 structure .",
    "they may also be related to the apparent discrepancy in bulk @xmath5 0.4 k and resistive @xmath5 1.2 k in ceirin@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "as the occupation values obtained in both cases agree within two estimated standard deviations , these values were averaged for the final model ( ref.31 ) .",
    "the presence of ir atoms at two different positions is a key observation for understanding the atomic distribution on the surface as seen in the stm experiments .    considering the similarities between ceirin@xmath1 and cecoin@xmath1 the existence of structure pattern of tlaspd@xmath1 type",

    "an interpretation of the pseudogap formation as a precursor phenomenon to unconventional superconductivity may appear natural as the suppression of the dos at temperatures @xmath87 reduces the kinetic energy increase that accompanies the opening of a full charge excitation gap at @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , a suppression of the normal - state dos is a consequence of incoherent pairing above @xmath7 , a phenomenon which is more pronounced in superconductors with short coherence lengths .",
    "@xmath86 then marks the crossover energy scale to a regular metallic dos . yet , the origin and nature of the @xmath86-line , and concomitantly the pseudogap regime in ( primarily ) the cuprates has remained controversial @xcite . according to some theories ,",
    "@xmath86 is associated with a sharp phase transition into an ordered state out of which superconductivity arises .",
    "competing interactions , _ e.g.",
    "_ superconductivity and charge density wave order seem quite generally to promote the suppression of the dos above @xmath7 .",
    "a recent numerical study of the single - band hubbard model based on the cluster dynamical mean field theory with clusters containing up to 16 sites finds that the pseudogap regime itself competes with superconductivity and that the superconductivity in this model tends to reduce the charge excitation gap when it emerges from the pseudogap phase @xcite .",
    "the pseudogap phase in the hubbard model separates a mott insulator from the superconducting ground state .",
    "the pseudogap regime in cecoin@xmath1 thus seems to be of a different origin than the one in the cuprates as superconductivity in cecoin@xmath1 does not arise near a mott transition , but instead in close proximity of a spin - density wave quantum critical point .",
    "the coherence length @xmath88 in cecoin@xmath1 is only about 48 @xcite , so that the pseudogap regime may rather be caused by incoherent pairing .",
    "the situation is different for cerhin@xmath1 , where superconductivity is found near the onset of magnetism that is characterized by a critical kondo destruction @xcite .",
    "this local quantum criticality is associated with a mott - like localization of the 4@xmath2-moments @xcite .",
    "the observation @xcite of a pseudogap regime accompanying superconductivity in cerhin@xmath1 thus helps to elucidate the role kinetic energy gain at @xmath7 plays in unconventional superconductors . for",
    "spin - fluctuation mediated superconductors this question has recently been raised in the context of cecu@xmath49si@xmath49 @xcite",
    ". a better understanding of the occurrence and origin of the pseudogap regime in heavy fermion superconductors may thus foster a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between superconductivity and magnetism that apparently underlies almost all electronically driven superconductors .",
    "the investigated single crystals of ceirin@xmath1 exhibited a coexistence of the expected hocoga@xmath1-type majority structural pattern with a minority pattern ( 1.2% ) of the tlaspd@xmath1 type . here ,",
    "the combination of different techniques proved essential : while the xrd measurements showed that these structural impurities are present throughout the bulk of the samples ( not just at their surfaces ) the stm investigations directly visualized these latter , additional structural patterns at the surface . clearly , such `` structural impurities '' are to be expected whenever very closely related structure types can be realized within a given compound , and should be borne in mind in the consideration of complex physical properties .",
