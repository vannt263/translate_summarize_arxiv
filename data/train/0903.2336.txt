    "<S> we present the reconstruction of the wigner function of some classical pulsed optical states obtained by direct measurement of the detected - photon probability distributions of the state displaced by a coherent field . </S>",
    "<S> we use a photodetector endowed with internal gain , which is operated in the non - photon - resolving regime . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are performed up to mesoscopic intensities ( up to more than 30 photons per pulse ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be applied to characterize nonclassical continuous - variable states .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective implementation of quantum communication protocols requires the generation and measurement of optical states in the pulsed domain . in the continuous variable regime , the characterization of pulsed states of light is usually provided by time - resolved homodyne tomography ( ht ) @xcite , which allows obtaining , for instance , the wigner function of the state @xcite . though ht has proved its effectiveness on classical and quantum states further optimizations to achieve a proper spatio - temporal mode matching of signal and local oscillator @xcite are needed in the case of pulsed fields . on the basis of the results derived in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it was demonstrated that also direct detection can be used as an alternative to ht to obtain the wigner function starting from photon - number distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only experimental work @xcite was performed with continuous - wave weak fields and single - photon avalanche detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the method consists in detecting the light exiting a beam - splitter that mixes the signal with a coherent probe field , whose amplitude and phase can be varied ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function of the state can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the photon - number distribution of the field displaced by @xmath2 . to obtain @xmath1 reconstruction / inversion methods </S>",
    "<S> must be implemented @xcite that require a known and sufficiently high photon - detection efficiency @xcite . however , in some situations , knowing the statistics of detected photons can be sufficient to characterize the signal field state , as demonstrated in the pioneering work of arecchi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if we are able to characterize the detector response , we can infer the photon - number distribution from that of detected photons without inversion . obviously , obtaining or not the statistics of detected photons </S>",
    "<S> depends on the photon - counting capability of the detector , a fact that limits the range of intensities that can be investigated . </S>",
    "<S> + in this letter we exploit the linear response of a photodetector endowed with high gain in the scheme in fig .  [ setup ] to directly reconstruct the wigner function of some pulsed classical states of light in the mesoscopic domain . </S>",
    "<S> the detector output is analyzed through a new method @xcite that allows obtaining the detected photon distribution without any _ a priori _ knowledge of the states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we model the detection process as a bernoullian convolution @xcite and the overall amplification / conversion process through a very precise factor , which is taken as constant , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our method has the advantage of being self - consistent as the value of @xmath3 is obtained from measurements on the very field under investigation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to measure a field state at different values of the overall detection efficiency of the apparatus , @xmath4 , and to calculate the fano factor , @xmath5 , of the output voltages , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> since we can write @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the mandel parameter ) , @xmath3 can be obtained by fitting the experimental @xmath9 versus @xmath10 data as all the dependence on the field is in the slope , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath3 is evaluated , we find the detected - photon distribution by dividing @xmath6 by @xmath3 and re - binning in unitary bins . </S>",
    "<S> + let us call @xmath12 the distribution of detected photons , with @xmath13 the detected amplitude of the displacement field . if @xmath12 is linked to @xmath1 by a bernoullian convolution , we can write an expression analogous to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wigner ] ) , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the wigner function in the presence of losses @xcite and @xmath16 is that of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> it can be demonstrated that , for classical states such as non - squeezed gaussian states and their linear superpositions , we have @xmath17 , _ i.e. _ the integral in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wigloss ] ) preserves the functional form of the wigner distribution . </S>",
    "<S> + in the scheme in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] , a frequency - doubled q - switched nd : yag laser at 15  khz repetition rate ( quanta system ) provides linearly polarized pulses at 532  nm of @xmath18  ns duration . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is spatially filtered and split into two parts serving as signal and probe fields . </S>",
    "<S> the photon - number statistics of the probe is left poissonian while that of the signal is modified in order to get the different states to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> signal and probe are then mixed at a cube beam - splitter and a portion of the mixed field is delivered to a hybrid photodiode module ( hpd , h8236 - 40 with maximum quantum efficiency @xmath19 at 550  nm , hamamatsu ) through a divergent lens and a multimode optical fiber ( 600  @xmath20 m core - diameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> hpd has limited photon - number resolving capability but is linear over a wide intensity range . intensity and phase of the probe field </S>",
    "<S> are modified by a variable neutral density filter and by a piezoelectric movement , respectively . + we describe in detail the reconstruction of the wigner function of the vacuum state , which was obtained by simply blocking the signal . </S>",
    "<S> as the state is phase - independent , its wigner function is rotationally invariant about the origin of the phase space and the reconstruction of a section is enough for full characterization : we thus only varied the probe amplitude @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we implemented the characterization procedure described above at each value of @xmath21 by changing @xmath4 by means of a polarizer set in front of the optical fiber ( we estimate a maximum value of @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we recorded @xmath23 laser shots for each @xmath4-value . </S>",
    "<S> the fano factor for this series of data is shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vacuum](a ) : as expected for poissonian light , the angular coefficient is virtually zero . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the obtained @xmath12 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vacuum](a ) as bars . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the theoretical poissonian distributions ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> vacuum](a ) , symbols+line ) , calculated with the measured mean values , can be checked by evaluating the fidelity @xmath24 , in which @xmath25 is the number of elements of the distribution experimentally reconstructed . for the data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vacuum](a ) , we have @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> by using the measured @xmath12 we obtain the experimental @xmath27 displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vacuum](b ) as dots . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data perfectly lie on a section of the theoretical surface as calculated from the general expression for a single - mode non - squeezed gaussian state @xcite , @xmath28 in the case of no thermal photons ( @xmath29 ) and no coherent displacement ( @xmath30 ) . for a quantitative estimation of the quality of the reconstruction </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the mean error @xmath31/n$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the presented data yield @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> + to enforce the usefulness of our method , we consider two further cases in which phase - independent signal fields enter the bs : ( a ) a phase - averaged coherent state , obtained by randomizing the relative phase between signal and probe with a piezoelectric movement operated at a frequency of @xmath33  hz and covering 1.2  @xmath20 m span , and ( b ) single - mode thermal state , obtained by inserting a rotating ground glass plate into the pathway of the signal field , followed by a pin - hole selecting a single speckle . in the main panels of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phaseinsens ] we present the @xmath12 ( bars ) obtained from two sets of data corresponding to different @xmath21 values . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed @xmath12 for selected values of @xmath21 were then used to recover a section of the wigner function ( dots in the insets of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phaseinsens ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> + to compare the experimental results with theory , we have to take into account the mode - mismatching between probe and signal . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the imperfect superposition at bs leaves some residual probe light that is measured together with the mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> thus the measured distributions result to be the convolution of those of the mixed state with the poissonian distribution of the residual probe , while the wigner function is the product of the expected wigner function with that ( gaussian ) of the residual probe @xcite . in case ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between signal and probe was @xmath34 while in case ( b ) it was @xmath35 , owing to the further difficulty of producing a stable single - mode thermal state . </S>",
    "<S> + in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phaseinsens ] we plot two theoretical curves superimposed to each set of experimental @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> one ( white symbols+line ) was evaluated from the expected theoretical distribution in which the measured mean values for signal and probe were inserted . </S>",
    "<S> the other ( black symbols+line ) was evaluated by calculating the expected theoretical distribution with a probe reduced by a factor corresponding to the overlap and then convolving it with a poissonian distribution having a mean value equal to that of residual probe . </S>",
    "<S> the latter distributions exhibit better superimposition , also testified by the increase in the fidelity from @xmath36 to @xmath37 in ( a ) and from @xmath38 to @xmath39 in ( b ) . finally , in the insets of fig .  [ phaseinsens ] </S>",
    "<S> we plot the theoretical wigner functions obtained upon the correction procedure described above . </S>",
    "<S> the non - corrected expected surfaces are not plotted for the sake of clarity . </S>",
    "<S> the expected wigner function of the phase - averaged coherent state is @xmath40\\ ; , \\label{eq : wignerphav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath41 is the modified bessel function and @xmath42 is the mean number of detected photons in the signal at the output of the bs . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner function of the single - mode thermal state comes from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : wignergauss ] ) for @xmath30 and @xmath43 equal to the number of detected thermal photons in the signal field at the output of the bs . since during the experiments we had some fluctuations of the signal field intensity </S>",
    "<S> , we kept the value of the signal as a fitting parameter and compared it with the average of the measured values . </S>",
    "<S> for the two cases under investigation we got @xmath44 and @xmath45 to be compared with 1.55 and 1.63 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on the wigner were @xmath46 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , we implemented the reconstruction of the wigner function of some pulsed classical light fields starting from direct measurements of the statistics of the detected photons . </S>",
    "<S> what made the experiments feasible was the choice of a single - photon sensitive linear detector together with a new data analysis method . </S>",
    "<S> works are in progress at our laboratory in como , whose aim is the reconstruction of a phase - dependent signal field , namely a coherent field , as well as to characterize non - classical states , both squeezed and conditional , in the same intensity regime we explored for classical ones .    </S>",
