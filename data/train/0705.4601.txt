    "understanding the longevity of protoplanetary disks around stars , and their dust and gas content , is an important step in understanding the formation of planetary systems .",
    "the exploration of the dust content of disks has been carried out from near - infrared to millimetre wavelengths , probing from hot disks near the stellar surface out to hundreds of au .",
    "the dust mass and temperature can be deduced from the spectral energy distribution , although shortwards of the far - infrared the dust emission is optically thick and so detailed models are needed to understand the distribution of material @xcite .",
    "observations of carbon monoxide in disks are used to estimate the mass of molecular gas , however this is subject to a number of uncertainties .",
    "the co may be photodissociated ; it freezes out on grains and is only a small amount of the total gas .",
    "the h@xmath1/co ratio is highly variable due to these effects , and co only effectively traces layers of the disk above and below the mid - plane .",
    "thus a direct tracer of the bulk of the gas is to be preferred .",
    "molecular hydrogen is the principal gas component in disks and so direct observations of h@xmath1 have been undertaken by several groups , using the rotational - vibrational transitions observable in the near- and mid - infrared .",
    "mid - infrared observations of the pure rotational lines offer the most direct measure of the disk mass , as the lines are emitted by low temperature gas ( @xmath2100  k ) . the line intensity should give a direct measure of the disk mass for an optically thin disk . to date",
    ", detection of the pure rotational lines has proved difficult .",
    "thi and co - workers reported detections of copious quantities of h@xmath1  from a number of different types of source ( debris disks , herbig aebe stars and t tauri s ) using iso sws ( @xcitea , @xciteb ) .",
    "however , attempts to replicate these detections in more sensitive observations with ground - based instruments ( @xcite , @xcite ) have not detected the lines .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is that the h@xmath1 detected by iso was elsewhere in the large beam of the spectrometer , rather than in the circumstellar disk .",
    "both richter et al . and sheret et al .",
    "explain their non - detections by pointing out that the disks are optically thick at mid - infrared wavelengths and that the h@xmath1  may be therefore be self - shielded .",
    "a ground based detection of the v=0 - 0 rotational lines from the disk around ab aurigae has been reported by @xcite , who detect the v=0 - 0 s(1 ) , s(2 ) and s(4 ) lines from gas at t@xmath2670  k in a disk of mass 0.5@xmath3  .",
    "observations with spitzer are proving effective for probing the pure rotational lines of h@xmath1 in the circumstellar environment . @xcite",
    "have detected the v=0 - 0 s(2 ) and v=0 - 0 s(3 ) lines of h@xmath1 towards 6 of a total of 76 t tauri and herbig aebe sources in their sample using the spitzer infrared spectrograph .",
    "these spectra show the presence of h@xmath1 gas at t@xmath4500  k.    h@xmath1 in disks may also be excited to higher vibration levels and emit in the near - infrared .",
    "the principle excitation mechanisms are by collisions in warm , dense gas or due to the passage of a shock , by absorption of a uv photon and subsequent radiative decay or by x - rays",
    ". all of these mechanisms may be in action in a circumstellar disk .",
    "the first detection of emission from the v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line at 2.1218@xmath5 m was been reported by @xcite in tw hya . following this , the line has been detected by @xcite and @xcite for a selection of t tauri stars and by by @xcite for lkh@xmath6 264 . in these sources , the authors conclude that the line emission arises from a quiescent disk .",
    "the line width of the h@xmath1  emission from lkh@xmath6 264 suggests emission from a radius of 1au from the parent star . for the sources observed by bary , weintraub & kastner ( 2003 ) , the measured widths of the lines are from @xmath7 and the h@xmath1 molecules are orbiting from 1030  au .",
    "the detection of excited h@xmath1  at these radii offers the possibility of a large reservoir of cold h@xmath1  associated with the zone of giant planet formation .    estimating the total h@xmath1 mass is a complex task , as each of the possible excitation mechanisms may be at work in a particular disk .",
    "work so far @xcite suggests that the v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line is tracing only a thin hot zone at the top surfaces of the gas disk , and so is not ideal as a bulk mass tracer .",
    "however , the presence of this line is very useful as an indicator that gas is still present in a disk ; as a diagnostic of the orbital radius ( with high resolution spectroscopy ) ; and for comparison to dust excesses from the inner disk .",
    "these data may address the vital question of whether a gas supply still exists at a few myr , when giant planet cores have grown massive enough to begin to accrete their thick atmospheres .",
    "the discovery of a new young star cluster , @xmath0 chamaeleontis at a distance of just 97pc by @xcite presents an exciting opportunity for studying disk formation at close range .",
    "the discovery was made in a deep rosat image .",
    "@xcite found that an unusually high proportion of the stars have an l - band excess indicative of the presence of a dust disk .",
    "for their derived age of the stars in the cluster ( 9  myr ) , such a high disk fraction ( 60  % @xmath813  % ) implied that disk lifetimes may be higher than previously thought .",
    "@xcite measured the disk fraction in clusters of different ages , finding a linear relationship between cluster age and disk fraction . from this , the disk fraction should drop below 60  % for an age of 2 - 3  myr .",
    "recent work on the @xmath0 chamaeleontis cluster has challenged the idea that it has an unusually high disk fraction for the age of the cluster . the age has been revised downwards slightly to 6 ( 1 , + 2 )  myr @xcite and new l - band data @xcite cast doubt on some of the earlier disk excesses .",
    "the @xcite results reduce the disk fraction to 17  % @xmath811  % , which is consistent with the decline in disk fraction with age measured by @xcite.longer wavelength observations with the irac camera on spitzer confirm that two stars from the cluster ( recx11 and echa  j0843.4 - 7905  ) show excesses in the @xmath9-[3.6 ] colour , closest to the k - l colour determined by @xcite , but that more dust disks are revealed from the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] versus [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] colour - colour diagram @xcite . in total , @xcite find infared excesses from 6/15 of the stars in @xmath0 cham .    motivated by these discoveries and the successes of bary et al . in detecting excited h@xmath1 , we elected to attempt detections of the v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line of h@xmath1 in the seven @xmath0  cham stars identified by lyo et al . as having infrared excesses using high spectral resolution infrared spectroscopy .",
    "four of these sources ( recx5 , recx11 , recx9 and echa  j0843.4 - 7905  ) are identified as having disks by @xcite .",
    "the presence of significant quantities of gas in these 58  myr - old disks would extend the possible timescales for the formation of gas giant planets .",
    "we report here on the search for h@xmath1 in these disks and discuss the connection of gas to the dust content , excitation mechanisms and age of the stars .",
    "the observations were carried out on 25 february 2005 using the phoenix high resolution infrared spectrograph on the southern gemini telescope at cerro pachon , chile .",
    "the observations were carried out in conditions of thin cirrus ; the seeing , as measured from the full width half maxima of the stars , varied between 0.5  arcsec and 0.8  arcsec during the night .",
    "phoenix is a single order spectrograph containing a 1024x1024 insb aladdin ii array @xcite . with the k4748 filter and",
    "the grating centred at the wavelength of the h@xmath1 1 - 0 s(1 ) line ( 2.1218  @xmath10 m ) the wavelength coverage obtained was from 2.11787  @xmath10 m to 2.12703  @xmath10 m .",
    "the slit width selected was 0.35arcsec , matched to four detector pixels .",
    "the spectral resolving power close to the wavelength of the h@xmath1 line was measured to be 62,400 , using a telluric oh line at 2.121774  @xmath10 m .",
    "this corresponds to a wavelength range per pixel of 0.34@xmath11 m .",
    "each source was acquired through the phoenix imaging channel .",
    "observations of the science targets were ratioed by the spectrum of the bright star beta car ( v=1.68 , a2iv ) to correct for atmospheric features .",
    "three observations of the star were made throughout the night .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained using the six brightest telluric absorption features present in the spectrum . using this calibration , the wavelengths of the two brightest",
    "oh emission lines present are obtained to better than 0.15@xmath11 m .",
    "we take this as a measure of the accuracy of the wavelength calibration .",
    "a flat - field frame was obtained from observations of a quartz halogen lamp in the gemini facility calibration unit @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration for the individual observations was carried out using the known k - band magnitude of the sources themselves ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the on - chip exposure time for the observations of the targets was 240  seconds , with exposures on the sky obtained by offsetting the source 5  arcsec along the 14arsec slit .",
    "multiple 240  second exposures were taken and coadded to produce the total on - source observation time listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "molecular hydrogen has been detected here in one of the seven sources observed in the @xmath0 chamaeleontis cluster .",
    "the spectra of all the observed sources are shown in figures  13 .",
    "the h@xmath1 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line is detected in only echaj0843.3 - 7905 , one of the sources known to have a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the spectral types for the stars range from k5.5 to m4.5 and are listed in table  1 .",
    "the error on the spectral type is @xmath80.25 subclasses for the m - stars and @xmath80.5 subclasses for the k stars @xcite .",
    "after removal of the telluric features using beta car , the observed stellar continuum from the targets is seen to contain numerous absorption features that vary with spectral type . to obtain the best estimate of the continuum level , and hence the optimum measurement of the h@xmath1 line ,",
    "echaj0843.3 - 7905 ( spectral type m3.25 ) was ratioed by the spectrum of stars of the same spectral type ( within the errors in spectral type ) .",
    "there are three such stars : recx3 ( m3.25 ) , recx6 ( m3 ) and recx12 ( m3.25 ) .",
    "the recx3 spectrum has poor signal / noise and was not used for the ongoing analysis .",
    "the recx12 and recx6 spectra were ratioed by beta car , as above , and then normalised to the flux level at @xmath12 m to provide a template of the m3 stellar absorption features .",
    "the echa  j0843.4 - 7905  spectrum was ratioed by the recx6 and recx12 templates separately , providing independent estimates of the h@xmath1  spectrum .",
    "excellent cancellation of the stellar absorption features is obtained in this way and comparing the two echa  j0843.4 - 7905  spectra provides an estimate of the systematic errors .",
    "the spectrum ratioed by the recx12 template is presented in figure  4 .    in both spectra",
    ", the h@xmath1 line is well fitted by a single gaussian . for the spectrum ratioed by recx6 the line width",
    "is @xmath13 m centred at @xmath14 m and , in the spectrum divided by recx12 , @xmath15 m centred at @xmath16 m .",
    "deconvolving the line widths with that measured for the unresolved telluric oh lines ( @xmath17 m ) we obtain a line width in the range @xmath18 m corresponding to a velocity of @xmath19 .",
    "the measured flux in the line is @xmath20 .",
    "the presence of h@xmath1  in the cirumstellar environment may be attributed to molecular gas excited in a disk or in an outflow .",
    "for example , @xcite concluded that excited h@xmath1  detected in the vicinity of dg tauri arises from an outflow within 100au of the star .",
    "this conclusion is based on a significant blueshift of the line relative to the systemic velocity of the star and to a spatial offset of the emission from the star .",
    "moreover , dg tau is known to have an energetic outflow .",
    "similarly , @xcite detected h@xmath1  v=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission from a bipolar outflow associated with kh 15d .",
    "we have considered the possibility that the h@xmath1  emission is from an outflow associated with echa  j0843.4 - 7905  .",
    "we fit gaussian functions to the the spatial profile of the star along the spectrograph slit at the wavelength of the h@xmath1  line and the adjacent continuum . subtracting the continuum from the line emission , and fitting a gaussian to the results we find that the peak of the line is centred on the same pixel as the peak of the continuum ( to within 0.5  pixels or 0.04  arcsec ) and there is no evidence for residual h@xmath1  emission in the wings of the line . at the distance of the @xmath0 chamaeleontis cluster ( 97  pc )",
    ", 0.04  arcsec corresponds to a scale of @xmath24  au .",
    "the seeing during the observations of echa  j0843.4 - 7905  was 0.7  arcsec ( 70  au ) . since emission from outflows",
    "is observed at these radii , this is consistent with either an outflow or disk origin of the h@xmath1  emission . adopting the radial velocity of the cluster from @xcite for echa  j0843.4 - 7905  ( + 16  km  s@xmath21 ) and correcting for the relative motion of the earth on the night in question",
    ", there is no evidence for relative motion of the h@xmath1  and the star ( to @xmath22 ) .",
    "in addition , the luminosity of the h@xmath1  line ( 7.2@xmath23@xmath24  ) is 201000 times fainter than the h@xmath1  luminosity seen in a range of outflows from class i and class ii sources @xcite or from dg tau , though we note that there are many factors , including age of the source , that will affect the luminosity .",
    "we take these diagnostics to mean that it is more likely that the h@xmath1  emission from echa  j0843.4 - 7905  arises in a disk and pursue this interpretation in the following section .",
    "assuming keplerian rotation around a star of the mass of echa  j0843.4 - 7905  ( taken as 0.4@xmath3  ) , the observed 1 - 0 s(1 ) line width implies that the gas is emitted from a region around a few au ( e.g. 2  au for a disk inclination of 45  degrees ) .",
    "the echa  j0843.4 - 7905  line profile and width is similar to those observed in the other 4 disk detections , with the exception of lkca  15 in which a clear double peaked signature is seen @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the l - band excesses arise at smaller radii of @xmath25  au @xcite .",
    "the correlation suggests that both trace properties of the inner disk .",
    "the prevalence of single peaked line profiles in h@xmath1  is perhaps suprising , given that a keplerian rotation pattern tends to produce a double - peaked line profile ( if the disk is moderately edge - on and optically thin in the gas line ) . a line broadening mechanism may be at work in which case , a narrower keplerian velocity would imply that the hot gas is at @xmath262  au",
    ". the broader line width may also be due to the contribution of emission from slower moving gas at larger radii from the star .",
    "@xcite show the h@xmath1  emission in the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line can extend over 10  au with flux greater than 0.1 of the peak flux .",
    "thus a contribution for an extended disk is consistent with this model and with a single peaked line .",
    "the v=1 - 0 s(1 ) traces regions of hot gas , comprising a small fraction of the total h@xmath1  reservoir of the disk . estimating this bulk mass by extrapolation from the h@xmath1  line strength is difficult , and would require detailed modelling of the line excitation mechanism(s ) to obtain a robust estimate .",
    "we follow previous authors in using the empirical scaling mechanism derived by @xcite to estimate the disk mass . calculating the mass of hot h@xmath1 from the line strength , we get 0.5@xmath27@xmath3  for echa j0843.3 - 7905 .",
    "this calculation assumes that the excited gas is optically thin , that ro - vibrational levels of h@xmath1  are populated as for a gas in thermal equilibrium at 1500k and that the hot h@xmath1  is located at 10  au to 30  au .",
    "using the scaling factors given in @xcite gives a mass in the range 0.05 to 5@xmath3  for the echa  j0843.4 - 7905  disk .",
    "the estimated disk masses for our objects are listed along with those of the other systems with h@xmath1  detections in table  2 .",
    "a disk of the mass implied by the upper range of this scale would be very suprising for the end of the planet formation timescale and we consider it to be unfeasible .",
    "indications of the likely disk masses may be judged from observations by e.g. rodriguez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who measure a disk of 0.3 - 0.4@xmath3  for the 0.8@xmath3  class 0 star iras16293 - 2422b and andrews & williams ( 2005 ) who obtain a mass of 0.5@xmath3  for the class i source l1551-irs5 , the latter being the largest disk observed to date .",
    "the assumptions inherent in our calculation will tend to produce an overestimate of the disk mass . at radii closer to the star",
    ", the gas will be hotter , the mass fraction in the excited state relatively higher and so the total mass reduced .",
    "although the mass estimate is very uncertain , important conclusions can be reached from the detection of gas in this and other systems .",
    "a moderate mass of h@xmath1 must still persist around echa  j0843.4 - 7905  at an age of 6  myr .",
    "it seems very unlikely that a hot component could exist unsupported by a large reservoir of cool gas in the bulk of the disk volume .",
    "the result for echa j0843.3 - 7905 , in conjunction with h@xmath1 1 - 0 s(1 ) detections towards lkca  15 ( 8  myr ) and tw  hya ( 10  myr ) , indicates that a gas reservoir does persist to the ages when gas giant planets are presumed to form .",
    "for example , in the models of @xcite , jupiter and saturn accreted their envelopes after 25  myr .",
    "the mass of hot h@xmath1  against age for all the published h@xmath1  detections is shown in figure  5 . with the small number of objects so far studied in h@xmath1  , and the wide range of parameters that affects the observability of excited h@xmath1",
    ", we can say only that there is a tendency for the older objects to contain a reduced mass of hot gas . considering the sources cited ,",
    "we also sought correlations between the detection of h@xmath1  line emission and various other star or disk parameters ( listed in table  3 ) .",
    "in particular , echa  j0843.4 - 7905  is the star in @xmath0 cham with the largest excess at both near and mid - infrared wavelengths , indicating a possible correlation with the mass of hot gas .",
    "however , we find no correlation between the mass of hot h@xmath1  and l - band excess . since excitation of the h@xmath1  may be by uv radation or x - radiation , we also considered these but again found no correlation . in the following section , we discuss these two excitation mechanisms .",
    "detailed models of h@xmath1 excitation in protoplanetary disks have been published by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they calculate the gas and dust temperature and density profiles self - consistently and predict line fluxes for h@xmath1 in a uv - excited scenario , for comparison with the tw  hya disk .",
    "their model disk contains 0.006  m@xmath28 of gas and dust and has an outer radius of 100  au .",
    "it may not directly apply to echa j0843.3 - 7905 but some interesting comparisons may be made .",
    "@xcite model the uv and ir emission from h@xmath1  assuming that the uv radiation field is described either by the blackbody temperature of the star or , as with many t tauri stars , that there is an excess of uv emission characterised by bremsstrahlung emission at higher temperature than the effective temperature of the star and emission from ly  @xmath6 .",
    "the latter model is appropriate for tw hydrae .",
    "the ` uv excess ' model predicts line strengths of @xmath29 those of the model without a uv excess . scaling the predicted 1 - 0 s(1 ) flux for tw hydrae ( at 56  pc ) to the distance of echa  j0843.4 - 7905  ( 97  pc ) , the ` uv excess ' model gives 1.14@xmath30 , around five times lower than observed from echa  j0843.4 - 7905  . making the simplifying assumption that the h@xmath1  flux would scale with disk mass , a disk of 0.03@xmath3  would produce the observed echa  j0843.4 - 7905  flux , approximately consistent with the lowest mass derived for the echa  j0843.4 - 7905  disk by empirical methods .",
    "we therefore consider that the observed flux is consistent with uv excitation of the 0.030.05@xmath3  disk by a star with significant uv excess radiation .",
    "the authors were unable to obtain any information on the uv spectrum of echa  j0843.4 - 7905  .",
    "one anomaly , compared with the model , is that the 1 - 0 s(1 ) emission is expected to peak at around 20au , rather than around @xmath22  au .",
    "since the radial dependence of the observable flux in the line depends on the disk geometry , we expect the difference to be attributable to the differences in disk mass .",
    "@xcite treat the excitation of h@xmath1  due to irradiation by x - rays .",
    "echa  j0843.4 - 7905  is not detected by rosat in the survey of the @xmath0 chamaelontis cluster by @xcite giving an upper limit of log(l@xmath31)=28.5 ergs  s@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "therefore we can predict only an upper limit for the 1 - 0 s(1 ) emission due to x - ray excitation .",
    "based on the upper limit for log  ( l@xmath31 ) , the rate of x - ray energy deposition at the radius of the emitting gas ( @xmath22  au ) and assuming an h@xmath1 column density of 10@xmath32 is 2.5@xmath33 .",
    "given a distance to the source of 97pc , assuming a gas density of 10@xmath34 and an emitting region stretching from 2  au to 22  au , we expect the emission in the 1 - 0 s(1 ) to be 2@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "given the large emitting annulus that we have taken and the x - ray upper limit , this will most likely be an overestimate and yet is siginificantly smaller than the observed flux .",
    "thus we conclude that x - ray excitation is not an important mechanism in this source .",
    "we have presented a survey of the @xmath0 chamaelontis cluster in the v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line of h@xmath1  . of four stars surveyed that are currently believed to have circumstellar disks ,",
    "h@xmath1  was detected in a single source ( echa  j0843.4 - 7905  ) .",
    "the line kinematics and flux have been interpreted as arising in a disk , illuminated by uv radiation from the central star .",
    "this result , combined with those in other clusters , shows that a significant amount of molecular gas is available for the formation of giant planets on timescales of 6 - 10  myr .",
    "the gas around echa  j0843.4 - 7905  is located at @xmath22  au , or beyond if the line width is not all keplerian .",
    "the total mass of gas is estimated at 0.03 - 0.05@xmath3  , which is slightly greater than the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) of 0.02@xmath3  .",
    "this gas disk meets many of the conditions thought to be necessary for the formation of giant planets , including long duration , high surface density and suitable size .",
    "for example , the gas reservoir is still substantial at 6  myr , so a thick gas atmosphere could be added to a jupiter - analogue core that has taken @xmath36  myr to form @xcite .",
    "further , the surface density is comparable to the conditions in which jupiter formed : for a standard mmsn gas - plus - dust profile of @xmath37  g  @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39(5 au ) is 150  g  @xmath38 , while for echa  j0843.4 - 7905  , a gas disk of 0.03 - 0.05@xmath3  exceeds an average @xmath40  g  @xmath38 even if spread over 20  au radius .",
    "the gas also lies at suitable distances where giant planets should start to form , in particular in relation to the snowline outside which @xmath39 of solid particles is favourably enhanced because volatiles freeze out into icy mantles on grains .",
    "@xcite show that the snowline in an mmsn disk lies at around 2  au , and further in for a low stellar accretion rate such as the @xmath41@xmath3  per year of echa  j0843.4 - 7905  @xcite .",
    "the keplerian estimate shows that the echa  j0843.4 - 7905  disk extends to at least 2  au , and so beyond the snowline . finally , in these conditions",
    "the type  i migration rate for an earth - mass proto - planet core is long : the model of @xcite suggest a migration timescale @xmath42 years , so a planet in the echa  j0843.4 - 7905  disk is unlikely to fall into the star .",
    "thus this star is a likely site for giant planet formation , but the three other stars surveyed without gas detections are less promising ; this result is roughly in line with observations of main - sequence sun - like stars , where in long - term monitoring programs @xmath43  % host gas giants @xcite .",
