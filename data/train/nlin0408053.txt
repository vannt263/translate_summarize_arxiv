    "solving nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) is one of the classical but potentially important areas of research in the theory of dynamical systems ( arnold 1978 ; jose & saletan 2002 ; wiggins 2003 ) .",
    "indeed the last century has witnessed considerable amount of research activity in this field .",
    "progress has been made broadly in two different ways : one is through geometrical analysis and the other is through analytical studies .",
    "the modern geometrical theory was born with poincar and developed later vigorously by arnold , moser , birkhoff and others ( percival & richards 1982 ; guckenheimer & holmes 1983 ; wiggins 2003 ) . in parallel with the geometrical theories various analytical methods",
    "have also been devised to tackle nonlinear odes .",
    "the ideas developed by kovalevskaya , painlev and his coworkers have been used to integrate a class of nonlinear odes and obtain their underlying solutions ( ince 1956 ) . as a consequence of these studies , nonlinear dynamical systems are broadly classified into two categories , namely , ( i ) integrable and ( ii ) nonintegrable systems .",
    "indeed one of the important current problems in nonlinear dynamics is to identify integrable dynamical systems ( lakshmanan & rajasekar 2003 ) .",
    "of course , these methods have close connection with the group theoretical approach introduced by sophus lie in the nineteenth century and subsequently extended by cartan and tresse , to integrate ordinary and partial differential equations ( see for example olver ( 1995 ) ; bluman & anco ( 2002 ) ) .    in order to identify such integrable dynamical systems different techniques",
    "have been proposed , including painlev analysis ( conte 1999 ) , lie symmetry analysis ( bluman & anco 2002 ) and direct methods of finding involutive integrals of motion ( hietarinta 1987 ) .",
    "each method has its own advantages and disadvantages . for a detailed discussion about the underlying theory of each method ,",
    "their limitations and applications we refer to lakshmanan & rajasekar ( 2003 ) . also certain nonlinear odes can be solved by transforming them to linear odes whose solutions are known .",
    "in fact , linearization of given nonlinear odes is one of the classical problems in the theory of odes whose origin dates back to cartan .",
    "for the recent progress in this direction we refer olver ( 1995 ) .    in this direction",
    "sometime ago prelle & singer ( 1983 ) have proposed a procedure for solving first order odes that presents the solution in terms of elementary functions if such a solution exists .",
    "the attractiveness of the ps method is that if the given system of first order odes has a solution in terms of elementary functions then the method guarantees that this solution will be found .",
    "very recently duarte _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) modified the technique developed by prelle & singer ( 1983 ) and applied it to second order odes .",
    "their approach was based on the conjecture that if an elementary solution exists for the given second order ode then there exists at least one elementary first integral @xmath0 whose derivatives are all rational functions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for a class of systems these authors ( duarte _",
    "2001 ) have deduced first integrals and in some cases for the first time through their procedure .    in this paper",
    "we show that the theory of duarte _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) can be extended in different directions to isolate even two independent integrals of motion and obtain solutions explicitly . in the earlier study",
    "it has been shown that the theory can be used to derive only one integral . in this work",
    "we extend their theory and deduce general solution from the first integral .",
    "our examples include those considered in their paper and certain important equations discussed in the recent literature whose solutions are not known .",
    "our study was motivated by two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is to show that apart from finding first integrals one can also deduce general solutions in a straightforward and simple manner . here",
    "the method we propose is not confined to the ps method alone but can be treated as a _",
    "general one _ , that is , suppose one has a first integral for a given second order ode then our method provides the general solution in an algorithmic way at least for a class of equations .",
    "the reason for merging our procedure with ps method rather than any other method is due to the following facts .",
    "( 1 ) for a given problem if the solution exists it has been conjectured that the ps method guarantees to provide first integrals .",
    "( 2 ) the ps method not only gives the first integrals but also the underlying integrating factors , that is , multiplying the equation with these functions we can rewrite the equation as a perfect differentiable function which upon integration gives first integrals in a separate way .",
    "( 3 ) the ps method can be used to solve nonlinear as well as linear second order odes . as the ps method is based on the equations of motion rather than lagrangian or hamiltonian",
    "the analysis is applicable to deal with both hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian systems .",
    "our second reason is to bring out a novel and straightforward way to construct linearizing transformations .",
    "particularly we demonstrate that using our procedure one can also explore linearizing transformations in a simple and straightforward manner .",
    "the latter can be used to transform the given second order nonlinear odes to a linear one , in particular , to the free particle equation . as we illustrate below these transformations",
    "can be deduced from the first integral itself which is totally _ a new technique _ in the current literature . in a nutshell ,",
    "once a first integral is known then our procedure , at least for a class of problems , not only gives the general solutions but also provides linearizing transformations .",
    "the ideas proposed here can be applied to coupled system of second order odes as well as higher order odes , which will be presented separately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we briefly describe the prelle - singer method applicable for second order odes and indicate certain new features in finding the integrals of motion . in  3 ,",
    "we have extended the theory in three different directions which indicates the novelty of the approach .",
    "the first significant application is that the second integral can be deduced straightforwardly from the method itself in many cases .",
    "the second one is to deduce the general solution from the first integral .",
    "finally we propose a method to identify linearizing transformations .",
    "we emphasize the validity of the theory with several illustrative examples arising in different areas of physics in  4 . in  5 ,",
    "we demonstrate the method of identifying linearizing transformation with three examples including the one studied in the recent literature .",
    "we present our conclusions in  6 .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the theory introduced by duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) for second order odes and extend it suitably such that the general solutions can be deduced from the modifications .",
    "let us consider the second order odes of the form @xmath4 } ,    \\label{met1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are polynomials in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with coefficients in the field of complex numbers .",
    "let us assume that the ode ( [ met1 ] ) admits a first integral @xmath7 with @xmath8 constant on the solutions , so that the total differential gives @xmath9 where the subscript denotes partial differentiation with respect to that variable .",
    "rewriting equation  ( [ met1 ] ) in the form @xmath10 and adding a null term @xmath11 @xmath12 to the latter , we obtain that on the solutions the 1-form @xmath13 hence , on the solutions , the 1-forms ( [ met3 ] ) and ( [ met6 ] ) must be proportional . multiplying ( [ met6 ] ) by the factor @xmath14 which acts as the integrating factors for ( [ met6 ] ) , we have on the solutions that @xmath15 where @xmath16 . comparing equations ( [ met3 ] ) with ( [ met7 ] ) we have , on the solutions , the relations @xmath17 then the compatibility conditions , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , between the equations ( [ met8 ] ) , require that @xmath21 & = -\\phi_x+s\\phi_{\\dot{x}}+s^2,\\label{met9}\\\\ d[r ] & = -r(s+\\phi_{\\dot{x}}),\\label{met10}\\\\ r_x & = r_{\\dot{x}}s+rs_{\\dot{x } } , \\label{met11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22    equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) can be solved in the following way . substituting the given expression of @xmath23 into ( [ met9 ] ) and solving it one can obtain an expression for @xmath24 .",
    "once @xmath24 is known then equation  ( [ met10 ] ) becomes the determining equation for the function @xmath25 .",
    "solving the latter one can get an explicit form for @xmath25 .",
    "now the functions @xmath25 and @xmath24 have to satisfy an extra constraint , that is , equation  ( [ met11 ] ) .",
    "once a compatible solution satisfying all the three equations have been found then the functions @xmath25 and @xmath24 fix the integral of motion @xmath0 by the relation @xmath26",
    "\\right\\}d\\dot{x}.    \\label{met13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ met13 ] ) can be derived straightforwardly by integrating the equations  ( [ met8 ] ) .",
    "note that for every independent set @xmath27 , equation  ( [ met13 ] ) defines an integral .",
    "thus two independent sets , @xmath28 provide us two independent integrals of motion through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) which guarantees the integrability of equation  ( [ met1 ] ) .",
    "we noticed that since we are solving equations  ( [ met9])-([met10 ] ) first and check the compatibility of this solution with equation ( [ met11 ] ) , one often meets the situation that all the solutions which satisfy equations  ( [ met9])-([met10 ] ) need not satisfy the constraint ( [ met11 ] ) since equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) constitute an overdetermined system for the unknowns @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , for a class of problems one often gets a set @xmath29 which satisfies all the three equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) and another set @xmath30 which satisfies only the first two equations and not the third , namely , ( [ met11 ] ) . in this situation",
    ", we find the interesting fact that one can use the first integral , derived from the set @xmath29 , and deduce the second compatible solution @xmath31 .",
    "for example , let the set @xmath30 be a solution of equations  ( [ met9])-([met10 ] ) and not of the constraint equation  ( [ met11 ] ) .",
    "after examining several examples we find that one can make the set @xmath30 compatible by modifying the form of @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 satisfies equation  ( [ met10 ] ) , so that we have @xmath35     = -fr_2(s_2+\\phi_{\\dot{x } } ) .",
    "\\label{met102}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] further , if @xmath36 is a constant of motion ( or a function of it ) , then the first term on the left hand side vanishes and one gets the same equation  ( [ met10 ] ) for @xmath32 provided @xmath36 is non - zero . in other words , whenever @xmath36 is a constant of motion or a function of it then the solution of equation  ( [ met10 ] ) may provide only a factor of the complete solution @xmath34 without the factor @xmath36 in equations  ( [ met101 ] ) .",
    "this general form of @xmath34 with @xmath37 can now form a complete solution to the equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) . in a nutshell",
    "we describe the procedure as follows .",
    "first we determine @xmath24 and @xmath25 from equations  ( [ met9])-([met10 ] ) .",
    "if the set @xmath27 satisfies equation  ( [ met11 ] ) then we take it as a compatible solution and proceed to construct the associated integral of motion . on the other hand if it does not satisfy ( [ met11 ] ) then we assume the modified form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the first integral which has already been derived through a compatible solution , and find the explicit form of @xmath40 from equation  ( [ met11 ] ) , which in turn fixes the compatible solution @xmath31 .",
    "this set @xmath41 can be utilized to derive the second integral .",
    "duarte _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) have considered certain physically important systems and constructed first integrals .",
    "further , they mentioned that applying the original ps algorithm to these first integrals ( by treating them as first order odes ) one can deduce the general solution . an interesting observation we make here",
    "is that there is no need to invoke the original ps procedure in order to deduce the general solution .",
    "in fact , as we show below , the general solution can be derived in a self - contained way . as the motivation of duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) was to construct only the first integral they reported only one set of solution @xmath27 for the equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) .",
    "however , we have observed that an additional independent set of solution , namely , @xmath30 , of equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) may lead to another integral of motion , @xmath42 , and if the latter is an independent function of @xmath39 then one can write down the general solution for the given problem from these two integrals alone straightforwardly .",
    "now the question is whether one will be able to find a second pair of solution for the system ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) and construct @xmath42 through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) . after investigating several examples we observed the following .",
    "( i ) for a class of equations , including that of harmonic oscillator , equation coming from general relativity and the generalized modified emden equation with constant external forcing one can construct a second pair of solution @xmath30 and deduce @xmath42 through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) straightforwardly .",
    "we call this class as type i. ( ii ) for another class of equations we can find explicitly @xmath30 from ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) but one is unable to integrate equation  ( [ met13 ] ) exactly and obtain the second integral @xmath42 explicitly .",
    "we call this class as type ii . the examples included in this category are helmhotz oscillator and duffing oscillator . for this class of equations we identify an alternate way to derive the second integration constant .",
    "( iii ) besides the above there exists another category in which the systems do not even admit a second pair @xmath30 of solution in simple rational forms for the equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) and we call this category as type iii .",
    "an example under this class is the duffing - van der pol oscillator which is one of the prototype examples for the study of nonlinear dynamics in many branches of science . for this class of equations",
    "also we identify an alternate way to obtain the second integral .      to overcome the difficulties in constructing the second constant in types ii and iii we propose the following procedure .",
    "as our aim is to derive the general solution for the given problem , we split the functional form of the first integral @xmath43 into two terms such that one involves all the variables @xmath44 while the other excludes @xmath3 , that is , @xmath45 now let us split the function @xmath46 further in terms of two functions such that @xmath46 itself is a function of the product of the two functions , say , a perfect differentiable function @xmath47 and another function @xmath48 , that is , @xmath49 we note that while rewriting equation ( [ met13a ] ) in the form ( [ met13b ] ) , we demand the function @xmath50 in ( [ met13a ] ) automatically to be a function of @xmath51 .",
    "the reason for making such a specific decomposition is that in this case one can rewrite equation  ( [ met13b ] ) as a simple first order ode for the variable @xmath52 ( see equation  ( [ met13d ] ) below ) .",
    "actually , we realized originally such a possibility for the case of the integrable force - free duffing - van der pol oscillator equation ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , which has now been generalized in the present case . now identifying the function @xmath52 as the new dependent variable and the integral of @xmath53 over time as the new independent variable , that is , @xmath54 one indeed obtains an explicit transformation to remove the time dependent part in the first integral ( [ met13 ] ) .",
    "we note here that the integration on the right hand side of ( [ met13c ] ) leading to @xmath55 can be performed provided the function @xmath53 is an exact derivative of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath56 , so that @xmath55 turns out to be a function @xmath1 and @xmath2 alone . in terms of the new variables ,",
    "equation ( [ met13b ] ) can be modified to the form @xmath57 in other words , @xmath58 now rewriting equation ( [ met13d ] ) one obtains a separable equation @xmath59 which can lead to the solution after an integration .",
    "now rewriting the solution in terms of the original variables one obtains a general solution for ( [ met1 ] ) .",
    "finally , one may note the following interesting point in the above analysis .",
    "suppose @xmath60 is zero in equation  ( [ met13d ] ) .",
    "then one obtains the simple equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant . in other words",
    "we have @xmath63 which is nothing but the free particle equation . in this case the new variables @xmath55 and @xmath64 helps us to transform the given second order nonlinear ode into a linear second order ode which in turn leads to the solution by trivial integration . the new variables @xmath55 and @xmath64 turn out to be the linearizing transformations .",
    "we discuss in detail about this possibility separately in  5 .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the theory discussed in the previous section with suitable examples . in particular , we consider several interesting examples , including those considered in duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) and derive general solutions and establish complete integrability of these dynamical systems .",
    "we split our analysis into three categories . in the first category we consider examples in which the @xmath65 , can be derived straightforwardly from the relation ( [ met13 ] ) . in the second and third categories we follow our own procedure detailed in ",
    "3@xmath66 and  3@xmath67 and deduce the second constant .",
    "we note that one can apply our procedure to a wide range of systems of second order of type ( [ met1 ] ) but for illustration purpose we consider only a few examples in the following .",
    "as mentioned earlier for certain equations one can also get the second pair of solution @xmath30 , in an algorithmic way , from the determining equations ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) and construct @xmath42 through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) .",
    "we observe that the examples 1 and 2 discussed in duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) can be solved in this way and so we consider these two examples first and then a nontrivial example in the following .",
    "duarte _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) considered the following equation , which was originally derived by buchdahl ( 1967 ) in the theory of general relativity , @xmath68 and deduced the first integral @xmath43 through their procedure . in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss their results and then illustrate our ideas . substituting @xmath69 into ( [ met9])-([met11 ] )",
    "we get @xmath70 as mentioned in sec .  2",
    "let us first solve equation  ( [ cat12 ] ) and obtain an explicit form for the function @xmath24 .",
    "to do so duarte _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) consider an ansatz for @xmath24 of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are arbitrary functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "a rational form for @xmath24 can be justified , since from ( [ met8 ] ) one may note that @xmath76 .",
    "so we consider only rational forms in @xmath3 for @xmath24 for all the examples which we consider in this paper .",
    "one may note that in certain examples , including the present one and examples 3 and 5 ( given below ) , this form degenerates into a polynomial form in @xmath3 . however , for other examples like the examples 2 and 4 below , one requires a rational form such as ( [ cat15 ] ) . to be general ,",
    "we carry out an analysis with the form ( [ cat15 ] ) .    substituting ( [ cat15 ] ) into ( [ cat12 ] ) and equating the coefficients of different powers of @xmath3 to zero we get a set of partial differential equations for the variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . solving them",
    "one obtains @xmath77    we note that duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) have reported only the expression @xmath78 , as the solution for equation  ( [ cat12 ] ) .",
    "however , we find @xmath37 also forms a solution for ( [ cat12 ] ) and helps to deduce the general solution . substituting these forms @xmath78 and @xmath37 into ( [ cat13 ] ) and solving the latter one can get an explicit form for the function @xmath25 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath78 . substituting the latter into ( [ cat13 ] ) we get the following equation for @xmath25 : @xmath79 in order to solve ( [ new2 ] )",
    "again one has to make an ansatz .",
    "we assume that the following form for @xmath25 , that is , @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are arbitrary functions of @xmath83 . since @xmath84 ( vide equation  ( [ met8 ] ) ) the form of @xmath25 may be a polynomial or rational in @xmath3 .",
    "so depending upon the problem one has to choose an appropriate ansatz . to begin with one can consider simple polynomial ( in @xmath3 ) for @xmath25 and if it fails then one can go for rational forms .",
    "let us start with equation  ( [ new3 ] ) . now substituting ( [ new3 ] ) into ( [ new2 ] ) and equating the coefficients of different powers of @xmath3 to zero and solving the resultant equations one can obtain finally @xmath85 .",
    "now the solution @xmath86 and @xmath85 has to satisfy the equation  ( [ cat14 ] ) in order to be a compatible solution , which is indeed true .",
    "once @xmath25 and @xmath24 have been found the first integral @xmath43 can be fixed easily using the expression ( [ met13 ] ) as @xmath87 one can easily check that @xmath39 is constant on the solutions , that is , @xmath88 .",
    "this integral has been deduced in duarte _",
    "however , the second expression , @xmath37 has been ignored by the authors since the corresponding @xmath32 coming out of ( [ cat13 ] ) does not form a compatible solution , that is , it does not satisfy ( [ cat14 ] ) .",
    "but in the following we show how one can make it compatible and use it effectively to deduce the second integration constant .",
    "now substituting the expression @xmath89 into ( [ cat13 ] ) and solving it in the same way as outlined in the previous paragraph we obtain the following form for @xmath25 , namely , @xmath90 however , this set @xmath30 does not satisfy the extra constraint ( [ cat14 ] ) .",
    "in fact , not all forms of @xmath25 coming out from ( [ met10 ] ) satisfy ( [ met11 ] ) in general .",
    "as we explained in  3 , the form of @xmath32 given in ( [ new4 ] ) may not be the complete form but might be a factor of the complete form . to recover the complete form of @xmath25",
    "one may assume that @xmath91 where @xmath40 is a function of the first integral @xmath39 , and determine the form of @xmath40 explicitly .",
    "for this purpose we proceed as follows . substituting @xmath92 into equation([cat14 ] ) , we obtain an equation for @xmath36 , that is , @xmath93 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath39 . upon integrating ( [ new7 ] )",
    "we get ( after putting the constant of integration to zero ) @xmath94 which fixes the form of @xmath34 as @xmath95 now one can easily check that this set @xmath96 and @xmath97 is a compatible solution for the equations  ( [ cat12])-([cat14 ] ) . substituting @xmath37 and @xmath98 into ( [ met13 ] ) we can get an explicit form for @xmath42 , namely , @xmath99 from the integrals @xmath39 and @xmath42 one can deduce the general solution directly ( without performing any further integration ) for the problem in the form @xmath100 of course the same result can be obtained solving equation  ( [ cat16 ] ) from the first integral . however , the point we want to emphasize here is that an independent second integral of motion can be deduced to find the solution without any further integration , which can be used profitably when the expression for @xmath39 can not be solved straightforwardly .      to illustrate the above procedure also works for linear odes , in the following we consider the simple harmonic oscillator and derive the general solution . as the procedure of deriving the first integral has been discussed in detail in duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) we omit the details and provide only the essential expressions in the following .",
    "the equation of motion for the simple harmonic oscillator is @xmath101 so that the equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) become @xmath102 as shown in duarte _",
    "( 2001 ) a simple solution for the equations  ( [ cat102])-([cat104 ] ) can be constructed of the form @xmath103 which in turn gives the first integral @xmath104 through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) .",
    "however , one can easily check that @xmath105 is also a solution for the set ( [ cat102 ] ) and ( [ cat103 ] ) ( which has not been reported earlier ) but does not satisfy the extra constraint ( [ cat104 ] ) .",
    "so , as before , let us seek an @xmath98 of the form @xmath106 where @xmath40 is a function of @xmath39 . substituting ( [ new211 ] ) into equation  ( [ cat104 ] ) and integrating the resultant equation , we get @xmath107 .",
    "thus @xmath98 becomes @xmath108 now one can check that @xmath109 satisfies all three equations ( [ cat102])-([cat104 ] ) and furnishes the second integral through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) of the form @xmath110 using ( [ cat106 ] ) and ( [ cat1001 ] ) we can write down the general solution for the simple harmonic oscillator directly in the form @xmath111 in a similar way one can deduce general solution for a class of physically important systems .",
    "one may note that in the above two examples , @xmath42 can also be obtained trivially by simply integrating the expressions ( [ cat16 ] ) and ( [ cat106 ] ) without using the extended procedure .",
    "we stress that for certain equations one is not able to integrate and obtain the general solution in this simple way and has to follow the above said procedure in order to obtain the second integral . in the following",
    "we discuss one such example for which to our knowledge explicit solution was not known earlier .",
    "it is known that the generalized emden type equation with linear and constant external forcing is also linearizable since it admits an eight point lie symmetry group ( mahomed & leach 1989 ; pandey _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) . in the following we",
    "explore its general solution through the extended ps algorithm .",
    "let us first consider the equation of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "to explore the general solution for the equation  ( [ lam101 ] ) we again use the ps method . in this case",
    "we have the following determining equations for the functions @xmath25 and @xmath24 , @xmath115    as before , let us seek an ansatz for @xmath24 of the form ( [ cat15 ] ) to the first equation in ( [ lam102])-([lam104 ] ) . substituting the ansatz",
    "( [ cat15 ] ) into ( [ lam102 ] ) and equating the coefficients of different powers of @xmath3 to zero we get @xmath116 where subscripts denote partial derivative with respect to that variable . solving equation  ( [ lam106 ] ) we can obtain two specific solutions , @xmath117 putting the forms of @xmath78 and @xmath37 into ( [ lam103 ] ) and solving it one can obtain the respective forms of @xmath25 .",
    "to do so let us first consider @xmath78 . substituting the latter into ( [ lam103 ] ) we get the following equation for @xmath25 : @xmath118    again to solve equation  ( [ lam108 ] ) we make an ansatz of the form @xmath119 now substituting ( [ lam109 ] ) into ( [ lam108 ] ) and equating the coefficients of different powers of @xmath3 to zero and solving the resultant equations we arrive at @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath78 and @xmath122 satisfies equation  ( [ lam104 ] ) and as a consequence one obtains the first integral @xmath123    we note that unlike the other two examples , equation  ( [ lam111 ] ) can not be integrated straightforwardly to provide the second integral ( though one can in fact explicitly solve the resultant riccati equation after some effort ) .",
    "we follow the procedure adopted in the previous two examples and construct @xmath42 . now substituting the expression @xmath37 into ( [ lam103 ] ) and solving it in the same way",
    "as outlined above we obtain the following form for @xmath25 , that is , @xmath124 however , this set @xmath30 does not satisfy the extra constraint ( [ lam104 ] ) and so to deduce the correct form of @xmath32 we assume that @xmath125 substituting ( [ lam113 ] ) into equation  ( [ lam104 ] ) we obtain @xmath126 , which fixes the form of @xmath127 as @xmath128 now one can easily check that this set @xmath109 is a compatible solution for the set ( [ lam102])-([lam104 ] ) which in turn provides @xmath42 through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) , @xmath129 using the explicit form of the first integrals @xmath39 and @xmath42 , the solution can be deduced directly as @xmath130 to our knowledge , the above explicit solution , ( [ lam119 ] ) , of the equation ( [ lam101 ] ) is given for the first time .",
    "it has several interesting consequences for nonlinear dynamics , which will be discussed separately .      in the previous category we considered examples which straightforwardly give the integrals @xmath39 and @xmath42 through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) . in the present category",
    "we show that there are situations in which an explicit form of @xmath42 is difficult to obtain through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) even though one has a compatible solution for ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) .",
    "so one has to go for an alternate way in order to obtain the general solution for the given problem . for this purpose , we make use of the method proposed in  3@xmath66 . in the following we give examples where",
    "such a possibility occurs and how to over come this situation .",
    "recently almendral & sanjuan ( 2003 ) studied the invariance and integrability properties of the helmholtz oscillator with friction , @xmath131 where @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are arbitrary parameters , which is a simple nonlinear oscillator having a quadratic nonlinearity . using the lie theory for differential",
    "equations almendral & sanjuan ( 2003 ) found a parameteric choice @xmath135 for which the system is integrable and derived the general solution for this parametric value . in the following",
    "we solve this problem through the extended ps method .",
    "substituting @xmath136 into equations  ( [ met9])-([met11 ] ) we obtain @xmath137 making the same form of an ansatz , vide equations  ( [ cat15 ] ) and ( [ new3 ] ) , we find nontrivial solution exists for ( [ cat21])-([cat22 ] ) only for the parametric restriction @xmath135 .",
    "the respective solutions are @xmath138 now one can easily check that @xmath29 satisfies the third equation ( [ cat23 ] ) and as a consequence leads to the first integral of the form @xmath139 however , the second set @xmath30 does not satisfy the extra constraint ( [ cat23 ] ) and so we take @xmath140 which in turn gives @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is an integration constant , so that @xmath143 one can check that @xmath109 satisfy equations  ( [ cat21])- ( [ cat23 ] ) and so one can proceed to deduce the second integration constant through the relation ( [ met13 ] ) .",
    "however , upon substituting @xmath109 into ( [ met13 ] ) we arrive at @xmath144 it is very difficult to evaluate the integral and so is one is not able to obtain an explicit form of @xmath42 for this problem through this way .",
    "a similar form of @xmath42 has been also derived by bluman & anco ( 2002 ) and jones _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) for the duffing oscillator problem ( that is cubic nonlinearity in equation  ( [ helm ] ) ) .    unlike the other examples discussed in type i the present example possesses difficulties in evaluating the second integration constant .",
    "in fact , for a class of equations one faces such complicated integrals . to overcome this one has to look for an alternate way such that the second constant can be deduced in a straightforward and simple way .",
    "we tackle this situation in the following way .",
    "as we have seen , in most of the problems , we are able to deduce the first integral , that is , @xmath39 , straightforwardly and the first integral often admits explicit time dependent terms . a useful way to overcome",
    "this is to remove the explicit time dependent terms by transforming the resultant differential equation into an autonomous form and integrate the latter and obtain the solution . in order to do",
    "this one needs a transformation and the latter can often be constructed through ad - hoc way .",
    "however , as we have shown in the theory in  3@xmath66 , one can deduce the required transformation coordinates in a simple way from the first integral itself and the problem can be solved in a systematic way .    rewriting the first integral @xmath39 given by equation  ( [ cat26 ] ) , in the form ( [ met13a ] ) , we get @xmath145 now splitting the first term in equation  ( [ cat200 ] ) further in the form ( [ met13b ] ) , @xmath146 and identifying the dependent and independent variables from ( [ cat201 ] ) and the relations ( [ met13c ] ) , we obtain the transformation @xmath147 one can easily check that equation  ( [ helm ] ) can be transformed to an autonomous form with the help of the transformation ( [ cat202 ] ) .",
    "we note that the transformation ( [ cat202 ] ) exactly coincides with the earlier one which has been constructed via lie symmetry analysis in almendral & sanjuan ( 2003 ) .    using the transformation ( [ cat202 ] ) the first integral ( [ cat200 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath148 which in turn leads to the solution by an integration . on the other hand",
    "the transformation changes the equation of motion ( [ helm ] ) to @xmath149 where @xmath150 , which upon integration gives ( [ newi1 ] ) . from equation  ( [ newi1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the solution of this differential equation can be represented in terms of weierstrass function @xmath154 ( gradshteyn & ryzhik 1980 ; almendral & sanjuan 2003 ) .      in the previous two categories we met the situation in which we are able to construct a pair of solutions @xmath155 for the equations  ( [ met9 ] ) from which @xmath122 and @xmath32 have been deduced .",
    "however , there are situations in which one is able to construct only one set of solution @xmath156 and its corresponding first integral only and the second pair of solution @xmath157 can not be obtained by simple rational form of ansatz . in this situation",
    "one can utilize our procedure and deduce the general solution for the given problem . in the following",
    "we illustrate this with a couple of examples .",
    "one of the well - studied but still challenging equations in nonlinear dynamics is the duffing - van der pol oscillator equation .",
    "its autonomous version ( force - free ) is @xmath158 where over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time and @xmath159 , @xmath134 and @xmath160 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "equation ( [ dvp ] ) arises in a model describing the propagation of voltage pulses along a neuronal axon and has received a lot of attention recently by many authors .",
    "a vast amount of literature exists on this equation , for details see for example lakshmanan & rajasekar ( 2003 ) and references therein . in this case",
    "we have @xmath161 to solve equation  ( [ cat301])-([cat303 ] ) we seek an ansatz for @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the form @xmath162 upon solving the equations  ( [ cat301])-([cat303 ] ) with the above ansatz we find nontrivial solution exists only for the choice @xmath163 and the corresponding forms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 reads @xmath164 for this set one can construct an invariant through the expression ( [ met13 ] ) which turns out to be ( senthilvelan & lakshmanan 1995 ) @xmath165 to obtain a second pair of solutions for the equations  ( [ cat301])-([cat303 ] ) one may seek more general rational form of @xmath24 and @xmath25 by including higher polynomials in @xmath3 .",
    "however , they all lead to only functionally dependent integrals . as it is not possible to seek the second pair of solution by simple ansatz one has to see an alternate way as indicated in",
    ". we can deduce the required transformation coordinates from the first integral and transform the latter to an autonomous equation and integrate it .",
    "using our algorithm given in ",
    "3@xmath66 one can deduce the transformation coordinates from the first integral itself which turns out to be ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) @xmath166 where @xmath64 and @xmath55 are new dependent and independent variables respectively . substituting ( [ cat311 ] ) into ( [ dvp ] ) with the parametric restriction @xmath163 , we get @xmath167 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath55 . equation ( [ cat312 ] )",
    "can be integrated trivially to yield @xmath168 where @xmath43 is the integration constant .",
    "equivalently , the transformation ( [ cat311 ] ) reduces ( [ dvp ] ) to this form . solving ( [ cat313 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain ( gradshteyn & ryzhik 1980 ) @xmath169 ,   \\label{cat314}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath170{\\frac { 6i}{\\beta ^2}}$ ] and @xmath171 is the second integration constant .",
    "rewriting @xmath64 and @xmath55 in terms of old variables one can get the explicit solution for the equation ( [ dvp ] ) .    in the above",
    ", we have shown that the systems ( [ helm ] ) and ( [ dvp ] ) are integrable for certain specific parametric restrictions only .",
    "one may also assume that the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 involve higher degree rational functions in @xmath3 and repeat the analysis .",
    "however , such an analysis does not provide any new integrable choice .",
    "in fact , the present results coincide exactly with the results obtained through other methods , namely , painlev analysis , lie symmetry analysis and direct methods ( senthilvelan & lakshmanan 1995 ; almendral & sanjuan 2003 ; lakshmanan & rajasekar 2003 ) .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the complete integrability of nonlinear dynamical systems by constructing sufficient number of integrals of motion and obtaining the general solutions explicitly . another way of solving nonlinear odes is to transform them to linear odes , in particular to a free particle equation and explore their underlying solutions .",
    "eventhough this is one of the classical problems in the theory of odes , recently considerable progress has been made ( mahomed & leach 1989@xmath72 ; steeb 1993 ; olver 1995 ; harrison 2002 ) . in this direction",
    "it has been shown that a necessary condition for a second order ode to be linearizable is that it should be of the form ( mahomed & leach 1989@xmath72 ) @xmath172 where the functions @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 are analytic .",
    "sufficient condition for the above second order equation to be linearizable is ( mahomed & leach 1989@xmath72 ) , @xmath175 where the suffices refer to partial derivatives .    for",
    "a given second order nonlinear ode one can easily check whether it can be linearizable or not by using the above necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "however , the nontrivial problem is how to deduce systematically the linearizing transformations if the given equation is linearizable .",
    "as far our knowledge goes lie symmetries are often used to extract the linearizing transformations ( mahomed & leach 1985 ) .",
    "as we pointed out in  3 the linearizing transformations can also be deduced from the first integral itself , whenever the system is linearizable , in a simple and straightforward way and we stress that our procedure is new to the literature .",
    "in fact , we use the same procedure discussed in  3@xmath67 and deduce the linearizing transformations .",
    "the only difference is that in the case of linearizing transformations the function @xmath176 turns out to be zero in equation  ( [ met13b ] ) and as a consequence the latter becomes @xmath177 and the transformation coordinates become the linearizing transformations .",
    "we illustrate the theory with certain new examples in the following .      to illustrate the underlying ideas let us begin with a simple and physically interesting example , namely , the general relativity equation which we discussed as example 1 in  4 .",
    "we derived the solution ( [ app38 ] ) using the ps method . in the present section we linearize the system and derive its solution . rewriting the first integral ( [ cat16 ] ) in the form ( [ met13a ] ) @xmath178 and identifying ( [ gr01 ] ) with ( [ met13b ] )",
    ", we get @xmath179 with the above choices , equation  ( [ met13c ] ) furnishes the transformed variables , @xmath180 substituting ( [ gr03 ] ) into ( [ cat11 ] ) , the latter becomes the free particle equation , namely , @xmath181 , whose general solution is @xmath182 , where @xmath39 and @xmath42 are integration constants .",
    "rewriting @xmath64 and @xmath55 in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath1 one gets exactly ( [ app38 ] ) which has been derived in a different way .",
    "recently several papers have been devoted to explore the invariance and integrable properties of the modified emden type equations ( mahomed & leach 1985 ; duarte _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , @xmath183 in fact , it is one of the rare second order nonlinear odes which admit eight lie point symmetries and as a consequence is a linearizable one .",
    "recently pandey _ et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) have obtained the explicit forms of the lie point symmetries associated with the more general equation @xmath184 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath185 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "they found that not only the emden equation ( [ lin101a ] ) , but also its general form , that is , equation  ( [ lin101 ] ) , admits eight lie point symmetries .",
    "the authors have also reported that the explicit forms of the symmetry generators .",
    "however , due to the complicated forms of the symmetry generators it is difficult to derive the first integrals and linearizing transformations from the symmetries straightforwardly ( though in principle this is always possible ) . nevertheless , we discussed about the integrability of the case @xmath186 , @xmath187 of equation  ( [ lin101 ] ) as example 3 in  4 and deduced its general solution . in this section",
    "we transform the equation into free particle equation and deduce the general solution in an independent way .",
    "we divide our analysis into 2 cases , namely , ( i ) @xmath187 , @xmath186 and ( ii ) @xmath187 , @xmath188 and construct linearizing transformations and general solutions for both the cases . as",

    "one may note that in this case also while rewriting the first integral @xmath43 ( equation  ( [ lam111 ] ) ) in the form ( [ met13a ] ) , the function @xmath176 disappears , and as a consequence we arrive at ( vide equation  ( [ met13d ] ) ) @xmath193 which in turn gives the free particle equation by differentiation or leads to the solution ( [ lam119 ] ) by an integration . on the other hand vanishing of the function @xmath176 in this analysis",
    "is precisely the condition for the system to be transformed into the free particle equation .      finally , we consider the general case , that is , @xmath194 to explore the first integrals associated with the system ( [ lin302 ] ) let us seek the ps algorithm again . the determining equations for the functions @xmath25 and @xmath24 turn out to be @xmath195 as before",
