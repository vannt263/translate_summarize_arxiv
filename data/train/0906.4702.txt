    "one of the most outstanding expressions of intelligence in nonclassical physical systems , such as human crowds or animal groups , is their self - organization ability .",
    "self - organization means that the individuals composing the system can give rise to complex patterns without using intercommunication as an essential mechanism .",
    "for instance , in normal conditions pedestrians are known to arrange in specific patterns , chiefly lanes ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : photos]a - b ) , as demonstrated by many experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "lane formation may be fostered by a suitable setup of the space , as reported in @xcite : a test performed in a tunnel connecting two subway stations in budapest showed that a series of columns , placed in the middle of the walkway , induce pedestrians to organize in two oppositely walking lanes , preventing each of them to expand up to the full width of the corridor .",
    "more in general , lanes form also spontaneously , _",
    "i.e. _ , without the need for being triggered by environmental factors , provided the density of pedestrians is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "this is particularly evident if one considers the case of two groups of people , walking in opposite directions , which meet and cross ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "+ ( a ) +   + ( b )     + ( c ) +   + ( d ) +   + ( e )    grouping and self - organization are well known and largely observed also in animals , see for example @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are in fact ubiquitous , ranging from bird flocks in the sky to migrating lobsters on the sea floor .",
    "many papers on this subject ( see , among others , @xcite ) proved by means of numerical simulations that few simple rules adopted by each animal can give rise to a complex organization of the whole group .",
    "patterns commonly seen in nature are ( see @xcite for the nomenclature ) : globular clusters ( e.g. , starlings , fig . [",
    "fig : photos]c , surf scoters , fig .",
    "[ fig : photos]d ) , extended and front clusters ( e.g. , wildebeests , antelopes , pigeons ) , lines ( e.g. , penguins , lobsters , elephants , fig .",
    "[ fig : photos]e ) , vees , jays , and echelons ( e.g. , geese ) .",
    "motivations and convenience of these patterns are still under investigations , especially for vees .",
    "it is commonly agreed that self - organization is the result of elementary actions that each subject performs to fulfill specific wills . concerning pedestrians ,",
    "the following basic guidelines can be identified :    * the will to reach specific targets , e.g. , an exit or a meeting point , which drives pedestrians along preferential paths , determined mainly by the geometry and the spatial arrangement of the walking area . unlike animals , pedestrians experience strong interactions with the environment , because they usually move in highly structured spaces scattered with all sorts of obstacles . * the will to not stay too close to one another , with a preference for uncrowded areas ( _ repulsion _ from other individuals ) .",
    "pedestrians may agree to deviate from their preferred path , looking for free surrounding room .",
    "in addition , it is reasonable to believe that occasionally also a mild form of cohesion occurs , which translates the tendency of pedestrians to not remain isolated .",
    "this happens , for instance , in those groups whose individuals share specific relationships , such as groups of tourists in guided tours .    for animals , the basic guidelines can instead be outlined as follows :    * the will to not stay too close to one another , in order to avoid collisions ( _ repulsion _ from other individuals ) . * the will to not remain isolated ( group _ cohesion _ ) .",
    "grouping is in fact advantageous for many reasons , such as predator avoidance or food search , see @xcite .    like pedestrians ,",
    "also animals may want to reach some specific destinations ( e.g. , when they migrate ) .",
    "however , the direction of motion toward targets is usually almost constant for quite a long time , because animals move in large and basically obstacle - free environments .",
    "therefore , this aspect plays a minor role in the description of their self - organization , corresponding to a simple translation of the center of mass of the whole group .",
    "self - organization can be broken under particular circumstances entailing a dramatic change in the basic interaction rules discussed above . for pedestrians , an illuminating example is panic , when individuals tend to cram toward a common target ( e.g. , an escape ) instead of seeking the less congested paths .",
    "lane formation is then ruled out and less organized patterns emerge in the crowd , probably in consequence of a strong simplification of the interaction rules .",
    "nevertheless , the arrangement of the environment may help restore , at least partially , the normal order of the flow .",
    "a typical example is that of an obstacle placed in front of an exit , which in some situations ( presumably under panic conditions ) may improve the flow of people through the exit itself , provided shape , dimensions , and position of the obstacle are accurately studied .",
    "this is a variant of the so - called braess paradox @xcite , which states that a condition intuitively expected to lead to a worse situation may instead give rise to better outcomes . in animals ,",
    "the changes in the behavior are even more evident .",
    "external conditions ( e.g. , presence of predators , weather ) , group tasks ( feeding , exploring ) or group speed can modify the interaction rules , leading to great modifications in the resulting patterns of the group . the environment usually does not interfere much , and pattern formation is mainly due to interactions among the individuals .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with mathematical modeling of the above - discussed systems , with the specific aim of describing the spontaneous emergence of self - organization .",
    "in particular , we focus on two basic characteristics of the interactions among the individuals , namely non - locality in space and anisotropy .",
    "the inclusion of these factors makes our models able to explain the differences observed in self - organization and pattern formation of various groups of agents in terms of different visual fields and sensing zones .    at the same time",
    ", we introduce a modeling framework based on the measure theory , that allows for a unified formulation of macroscopic and microscopic models in any space dimension , and for a convenient numerics .",
    "this enables us to investigate both macroscopic self - organization , typical of large crowds of pedestrians , and microscopic self - organization , more specific of animal groups , using common modeling principles and tools .    in more detail ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , sect .",
    "[ sect : class - vs - int ] proposes a comparison between classical and intelligent particles , and highlights the main differences of the latter with respect to more standard systems dealt with by classical physics . in view of these considerations ,",
    "[ sect : new_mech ] develops some preliminary modeling strategies to enhance intelligence as a distinctive feature of the systems at hand .",
    "these serve as guidelines for sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] , where the modeling technique by time - evolving measures is introduced and specific macroscopic and microscopic models are detailed .",
    "numerical tests on the ability of these models to reproduce spontaneous self - organizing patterns for both human crowds and animal groups are performed and commented in sect .",
    "[ sect : numtest ] .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] draws some conclusions and briefly sketches research perspectives .",
    "a plethora of physical systems can be basically described as systems of interacting particles , think for instance of fluids , gases , and similar matters .",
    "actually , also human crowds and animal groups are susceptible to this rough characterization , although it should be clear from the previous discussion that the particle analogy is only formal .",
    "indeed , intelligence is what really makes the difference in this context : it gives rise to a decision - based dynamics determined by individual behavioral rules , rather than to a classical dynamics passively ruled by inertia .",
    "for this reason , human beings and animals are more properly characterized as intelligent particles ( denoted ips in the sequel for brevity ) .",
    "ips can act directly on the system , rather than being passively subjected to the evolution itself , whence their ability to self - organize and to generate complex patterns .    in the following , we summarize the main differences between classical and intelligent particles , in order to outline the main novelties posed by intelligent systems with respect to more standard frameworks .",
    "classical particles are _ robust _ , in the sense that they interact almost exclusively through collisions . for instance , gas particles change direction of motion and velocity only when hit by other particles , or possibly when they collide with the walls of the container in which the gas is stored .",
    "conversely , ips are _ fragile _ , they try as much as possible to avoid mutual collisions as well as to steer clear of walls and obstacles scattered along their path .",
    "classical particles are _ blind _ , indeed they have no information on the environment and on the distribution of the surrounding particles",
    ". therefore , their dynamics is essentially ruled by _ inertia _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , a passive response to the mechanical cues coming from the exterior . on the contrary",
    ", human beings and animals feature specific _ visual fields _ , hence they can obtain information on the surrounding environment ( e.g. , presence of obstacles , of walls ) and on the current distribution of ( a certain number of ) other agents .",
    "this information is then used to _ make decisions _ on the future individual evolution , generally by following some ordinary behavioral rules proper of the kind of agent under consideration .",
    "collisions among , say , gas particles require the latter to be sufficiently close to hit each other . due to the typical size of gas molecules , by far much smaller than the environments where they flow ,",
    "this has been classically understood as if the colliding particles were occupying the same spatial position at the moment of the impact ( see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) , hence assuming the conceptual approximation of _ local _ , _ i.e. _ , pointwise , interactions .",
    "conversely , ips do not interact mechanically , rather they are influenced by the presence of other individuals or objects a certain distance away , that they want either to approach or to avoid . the resulting interaction is thus _ nonlocal _ , because the agents do not need to be in contact to interact .",
    "we notice that there exist basically two types of nonlocal interaction : a _ metric _ one , such that each agent is influenced by _ all _ other agents located at a distance less than a given threshold ; and a _ topological _ one , such that each agent is influenced by a _ given number _ of other agents , no matter how far they are . topological interactions have been used in several models , e.g. , @xcite , this idea being supported by experimental investigations like , for example , @xcite on fish schools .",
    "other models @xcite do not include this feature in favor of a purely metric approach .",
    "however , recent results @xcite show that starlings interact topologically with other six / seven group mates .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that topological interactions are common in nature , even in pedestrians , since they are mainly due to a limited capacity in processing the information . on the other hand ,",
    "a purely topological interaction in a wide domain is not realistic , for an individual may not be concerned with very far mates ( e.g. , because it does not see them at all ) .",
    "another striking difference concerning the way in which classical and intelligent particles interact is that the first are _ isotropic _ , meaning that they are equally affected by mechanical cues coming from all directions .",
    "ips are instead _ anisotropic _ , _ i.e. _ , they are sensitive to stimuli coming from specific directions .",
    "this is partly related to the width of their visual field , which in pedestrians coincides with the half - space in front of them , whereas in animals covers often almost all the surrounding space .",
    "more precisely , the visual field must be intended as an upper bound for the regions in which cohesion and repulsion are active .",
    "indeed , repulsion can be expected to be mainly felt against the ips ahead rather than against those on the side or behind , especially in running people or fast - moving animals .",
    "cohesion instead is active toward the group mates in front , if the goal is to follow the head of the group , or in every direction , if the goal is the unity of the group .",
    "the ideas of limited visual field , expressed in terms of blind rear zone , and of anisotropic sensing are quite common in the biological literature , see for instance @xcite .",
    "however , they mainly play the role of passive features of the agents , and are not regarded as active features able to influence the shape of the group .",
    "particle collisions allow to describe the mechanics of classical systems by invoking the balance of linear momentum , as well as energy and entropy principles",
    ". a straightforward extension of these ideas to intelligent systems is not possible , because the ability of ips to make subjective decisions continuously puts and removes energy in and from the system , in hardly quantifiable amounts .",
    "entropy criteria may in turn be questioned , because entropy is classically related to the equiprobability of the states of a system , whereas self - organization promotes specific configurations of the ips .",
    "the idea that , in living matter , energy and entropy play a somehow atypical role was already suggested by schredinger @xcite in the sixties , who formalized it through the concept of _ negative entropy_.    0.3 cm it is useful , at this point , to consider a very borderline system with respect to the `` classical vs. intelligent '' dichotomy , namely vehicular traffic .",
    "traffic is , in principle , an intelligent mechanical system , because the intrinsic mechanics of the vehicles is tempered by the presence of the drivers , who determine a non strictly mechanical behavior of the cars .",
    "however , many successful models , relying on the fluid dynamical analogy of the flow of vehicles along a road , have been proposed in the literature ( see @xcite for comprehensive reviews on microscopic , kinetic , and macroscopic models ) .",
    "this approach has been possible , despite the nonstandard nature of the system at hand , because traffic is essentially one - dimensional , so that vehicles regulate their speed only .",
    "such a dimensional constraint reduces significantly the possibility of self - organization and pattern formation , therefore fluid dynamical modeling , entropy reasonings , and finally the development of models and theories based on nonlinear conservation laws are feasible .",
    "the discussion of the previous sections has highlighted a crucial feature of intelligent systems : their dynamics is only partially determined by classical ( pseudo-)mechanical cues , therefore , in principle , it is not fully describable within the classical newtonian framework of point mechanics . concerning this",
    ", we note that in the systems we are considering impulsive forces are often present .",
    "for example , an animal which starts moving reaches in a very short time its final velocity , which then remains constant for a while . including in the models such impulsive forces through a newtonian approach is quite difficult and , after all , needless .",
    "the dynamics of intelligent systems calls for a paradigm which enhances intelligence as a distinctive feature , rather than recovering it as a by - product of other principles . in this respect ,",
    "let us consider that , from the mechanical / dynamical point of view , intelligence might be regarded as the ability of the agents to control their velocity _ actively _ , _ i.e. _ , without the need for inertial accelerations caused by external actions . in order to take this aspect into account",
    ", we suggest to split the velocity @xmath0 of the agents in two basic contributions : @xmath1 to each of which there correspond specific modeling strategies . in more detail :    * @xmath2 is the _ external velocity _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the component of the total velocity depending essentially on actions exerted on the agents by the external environment .",
    "for example , in human crowds these may be the repulsion produced by obstacles and walls or the attraction produced by targets ( e.g. , doors , displays , other people ) . in animal groups",
    "this effect is instead greatly reduced , because animals move in much less structured and generally clear environments . for the external velocity , a newtonian - like",
    "modeling is feasible , hence @xmath2 can be deduced from inertial reasonings up to a careful identification of the external actions .",
    "* @xmath3 is the _ intelligent velocity _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the component of the total velocity that the individuals control actively .",
    "the intelligent velocity is determined by the behavioral rules that the agents comply to , and by the decisions that they consequently make , therefore it need not be newtonian . for instance , pedestrians and animals set up the intelligent velocity according to the occupancy of the surrounding space , so as to steer clear of congested areas while possibly preserving the compactness of the group .    a convenient manner to model @xmath3",
    "is by an _ equation of state _ of the form @xmath4(t,\\,x ) ,      \\label{eq : nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are time and space variables , respectively , @xmath7 comprises all state variables which can contribute to the determination of @xmath3 ( e.g. , the distribution of the agents in a suitable neighborhood , the metric and topological structure of the sensing zone ) , and @xmath8 is a functional relationship .",
    "many microscopic models of animal groups available in literature actually fit into such framework , and the same is true for macroscopic models using hyperbolic partial differential equations , see e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the forces do not appear explicitly , the velocity being expressed directly as a function of the density of the animals , usually in a nonlocal way . on the other hand , different models at both the microscopic and the kinetic scale rely instead , at least formally , on a more newtonian - like framework , in the sense that they recover the dynamics of the system from generalized forces responsible for the acceleration of the agents @xcite .",
    "similar considerations apply also to models of human crowds , for an overview of which we refer to @xcite . in particular",
    ", macroscopic models derived by closing the mass conservation equation with suitable relations for the velocity follow the ideas outlined above , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "other models resort instead more heavily to classical fluid dynamical analogies , indeed they supplement the mass conservation equation by a momentum balance equation invoking concepts like acceleration or generalized forces and pressures @xcite . in these models , it is in principle possible to introduce topological interactions among ips , as well as anisotropic sensing zones .",
    "unfortunately , models based on pdes and nonlinear conservation laws suffer from an important drawback : their mathematical treatment and numerical implementation get rather complicated in dimensions greater than one .",
    "indeed , in realistic cases of interest for applications one must deal with possibly punctured two - dimensional domains ( the holes representing the obstacles ) , which requires to handle boundary conditions in a way that may not be immediately suited for hyperbolic equations .",
    "therefore , we prefer to use an alternative modeling strategy , which , at the same time , enables us to develop a modeling framework capable to treat both the macroscopic and the microscopic scale within a unified theoretical formulation",
    ". then we will show the ability of specific models , deduced from this framework , to describe the emergence of self - organizing behaviors at the proper scale , according to the kind of agents under consideration .",
    "in this section we set up a modeling framework for the study of the behavior of ips . in doing this , we resort to a discrete - time dynamics and describe the occupancy of the space by the agents at different times via a sequence of positive radon measures .",
    "this approach is inspired by @xcite , where the authors address _ rendez - vous _",
    "problems for multi - agent systems , and has already been investigated in recent works @xcite . here",
    "we show furthermore that also microscopic models for animal groups can be recast in the time - evolving measures framework .",
    "therefore , we ultimately provide a unified modeling procedure to treat both macroscopic and microscopic intelligent systems .",
    "let us consider a domain @xmath9 , which represents the area where ips are located and move . in our discussion",
    ", @xmath10 is the dimension of the domain , from the physical point of view it may be @xmath11 .",
    "a great advantage of our approach is that there are basically no differences in the theory for different dimensions . at every time instant @xmath12",
    ", we define a radon positive measure @xmath13 over the borel @xmath14-algebra @xmath15 , such that , for each measurable set @xmath16 , the number @xmath17 measures the occupancy of the area @xmath18 by the ips . in other words ,",

    "[ fig : zones - micro ] .",
    "this also helps avoid singularities , _",
    "i.e. _ , non - integrability with respect to the dirac measure , in the second sum of eq . .",
    "finally , we assume that the external velocity of the agents is constant ( for instance , the vector @xmath155 for a rightward motion ) , as the environment is clear and we are mainly interested in the dynamics of the interactions among the ips .",
    "this way , we can formally drop @xmath2 from eq . by a simple change of frame of reference .",
    "in this section we address some relevant case studies , which highlight the ability of our model to reproduce self - organizing patterns at both the macroscopic and the microscopic scale .",
    "in particular , we focus on pedestrians for macroscopic self - organization , studying the emergence of oppositely walking lanes in crossing flows , the spontaneous arrangement of people in a group in motion , and finally the dynamics in a crowded environment scattered with obstacles .",
    "conversely , we study microscopic self - organization with specific reference to animals , for which a closer look is necessary in order to catch crystal - like structures and line formations .      as recalled in sect . [",
    "sect : self - org ] , pedestrians experience , in normal situations , a very mild cohesion among each other compared to repulsion .",
    "hence , in most numerical tests below we set @xmath156 and consider the following overall velocity : @xmath157(x)=\\frac{\\nabla{u}(x)}{\\vert\\nabla{u}(x)\\vert}+          { \\int\\limits}_{b_r(x)}f_r\\frac{y - x}{{\\vert y - x\\vert}^2}\\rho_n(y)\\,dy ,      \\label{eq : vn - pedestrians}\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is constant . due to the ahead - behind asymmetry of pedestrians , their visual field covers a frontal area only .",

    "this amounts to defining two measures @xmath164 , each of which evolves in time according to the push - forward .",
    "however , the two evolutions are coupled , since we assume that , within each group , repulsion is oriented against the individuals of the opposite group .",
    "specifically , this means that the intelligent velocities are such that : @xmath165(x)={\\int\\limits}_{b_r(x)}f_r\\frac{y - x}{{\\vert y - x\\vert}^2}\\rho^{(2)}_n(y)\\,dy ,       \\label{eq : vin - crossflows_a}\\ ] ] @xmath166(x)={\\int\\limits}_{b_r(x)}f_r\\frac{y - x}{{\\vert y - x\\vert}^2}\\rho^{(1)}_n(y)\\,dy ,      \\label{eq : vin - crossflows_b}\\ ] ] so that pedestrians try to steer clear of oppositely walking people and to gain instead room in their direction .",
    "the external velocities are the vectors @xmath167 and @xmath168 , thus groups walk rightward and leftward , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : crossflow ] shows that the model is able to account for lane formation when the two groups meet at the center of the domain and start to interact .",
    "in particular , alternate lanes fully emerge for both uninterrupted and time - periodic flow of people from the boundaries of the domain , and turn out to be a quite stable equilibrium configuration of the system .",
    "such a configuration is however reached in different times , being in particular more delayed in the second case , as a consequence of different intermediate dynamics undertaken by the system .",
    "notice also the spontaneous breaking of symmetry occurring between the two groups , which are instead specular at the beginning .     + ( a )     + ( b )     + ( c )      next we investigate the self - organization spontaneously emerging within a group of pedestrians in motion in a clear environment .",

    "as soon as people start to interact , the model predicts an expansion of the crowd in consequence of the repulsion . at the same time , the density decreases and becomes inhomogeneous due to the anisotropy of the visual field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pedgroup]b ) .",
    "in particular , given the orientation of the external velocity , top - bottom symmetry is preserved , because @xmath169 is symmetric with respect to @xmath2 . however , front - rear symmetry is lost , and most people remain initially concentrated in the rear part of the group , where the influence of the mass ahead is stronger . by consequence , in this zone",

    "[ ssubsect : cohesmacro ] ) shows that a small value of @xmath170 in the purely metric approach distorts the cohesion itself : aggregation is only partial , since little far group mates may not be seen .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a modeling framework for self - organizing intelligent particles , which takes into account both macroscopic and microscopic points of view , and is suitable to include topological and anisotropic interactions in an easy way and in any dimension .",
    "the results we have obtained from our numerical simulations suggest that these two features alone let self - organization emerge spontaneously , without forcing pattern formation via _ ad hoc _ agent - specific behavioral rules . in this respect , the most important parameters of the model are the ratio @xmath192 , _",

    "specifically , we have used the macroscopic scale to study self - organization in pedestrian flows , as in this case clearly distinguishable patterns emerge only when the density of people is sufficiently large .",

    "[ sect : self - org ] about braess paradox , this might imply optimization of the locations of some obstacles in crowded environments , like train stations or shopping malls .",
