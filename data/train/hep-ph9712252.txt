    "in the standard model all information about flavor and cp violation originates from the yukawa coupling matrices .",

    "for a suitable choice of the ckm matrix elements , @xmath25 , the standard model can provide a description of the observed cp violation .",
    "the fundamental reason for the size of the cp violation observed in nature remains a mystery , however , and must await a theory of flavor which can explain the values of @xmath26 and the ckm phase . if the ckm matrix contained no small parameters one would expect @xmath27 to be of order @xmath28 to @xmath29 rather than the observed value of order @xmath30 to @xmath20 .    of course , measurements of cp conserving observables have shown that @xmath31 are small for @xmath32 , and , given the measured values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , it is convenient to use the wolfenstein parameterization@xcite of the ckm matrix , in which case ( [ eq : csm ] ) becomes @xmath35 if we _ assume _ that the ckm matrix does not have any other small parameters , the standard model yields a value of @xmath4 of the observed order of magnitude .",
    "while this is not a prediction , it is an important success of the standard model , and has made the ckm theory the leading candidate for cp violation . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no similar success in any published alternative to the ckm theory of cp violation , since in these theories the order of magnitude of @xmath36 can only be fixed by fitting to the measured value of @xmath4 . in this letter",

    "we define a _ pure _ superweak theory to be one where all flavor changing phenomena ( other than @xmath4 ) are accurately described by the real ckm matrix . comparing figures 1 and 2 at low @xmath38",
    ", one sees that the new limit on @xmath45 mixing has excluded superweak theories with negative @xmath37 .",

    "] the recent observation of a candidate event for this decay @xcite is not sufficient to exclude pure superweak theories , but further data from this experiment could provide evidence against such theories .",

    "if @xmath4 is generated by new physics , why does this new physics not contribute to @xmath64 mixing ?",
    "in general it would be expected to also contribute to @xmath65 and @xmath66 processes . in the absence of a fundamental theory of flavor ,",
    "the relative sizes of the various flavor changing operators can be estimated only by introducing arguments based on approximate flavor symmetries .",
    "we assume that the underlying theory of flavor possesses a flavor symmetry group , @xmath67 , and a mass scale @xmath68 .",

    "the dominant flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions of the down sector of the standard model result from the `` 3 mechanism '' : small flavor breaking parameters which mix the light quarks with the heavy third generation quarks , together with a large , order unity , breaking of the flavor symmetry that distinguishes the third generation from the first two .",
    "hence , beneath the weak scale , the standard model yields an effective hamiltonian with dominant fcnc operators which contain a factor @xmath73 for each flavor changing current @xmath74 , and a factor @xmath75 from the loop integration .",
    "the relevant diagrams are all 1 loop , giving the @xmath76 factor , and involve the large gim violation of the top quark mass ; since there is no small flavor violating parameter , the rest of the loop integral has an order of magnitude given by dimensional analysis as @xmath77 .",
    "now consider physics beyond the standard model where the entire flavor structure of the theory beneath @xmath68 is controlled by @xmath67 and \\{@xmath69 }  both the yukawa matrices of the standard model , @xmath78 , and the non - standard model operators in @xmath79 .",
    "since the dominant down sector , fcnc effects from @xmath80 are known to arise from the `` 3 mechanism '' , we assume that @xmath67 and \\{@xmath69 } are chosen so that the dominant such effects from @xmath81 are also from the `` 3 mechanism '' .",
    "the most general parameterization of the `` 3 mechanism '' in the down sector involves four complex parameters : @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 , which describe the mixing of @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 . assuming all phases to be of order unity",
    ", we can describe the `` 3 mechanism '' in terms of just four real small parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "is understood for each operator . since the flavor changing interactions from both the standard model and the new physics",
    "are governed by the same symmetry , we can choose @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "such interactions can arise from many choices of @xmath67 and \\{@xmath69 } ; the particular choice is unimportant , however , as the phenomenology rests only on three assumptions    * there is an underlying theory of flavor based on symmetry @xmath67 and breaking parameters \\{@xmath69}. * the dominant non - standard model fcnc operators of the down sector arise from the `` 3 mechanism '' . * the symmetry breaking parameters of the down sector are left - right symmetric , and have phases of order unity .    in the standard model ,",
    "the dominant fcnc of the down sector arises from the `` 3 mechanism '' , so that it is useful to describe the effective theory beneath the weak scale by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h3 ] ) with @xmath97 and @xmath93 real .",
    "this special case of the `` 3 mechanism '' has a restricted set of gamma structures due to the left - handed nature of the weak interaction .",
    "we have argued that pure superweak theories are artificial , and we now study superweak theories where fcnc interactions are generated by the `` 3 mechanism '' and yield @xmath98 of ( [ eq : h3 ] ) .",
    "why should such theories have @xmath25 real when @xmath93 are complex ?",
    "one possibility is that @xmath67 forces the yukawa matrices @xmath78 to have a sufficiently simple form that they can be made real by field redefinitions .",
    "another possibility will be discussed later .",
    "since @xmath98 will be the origin of all @xmath3 violation , one may wonder if it could also account for all of @xmath99 .",
    "this is not possible  charged current measurements , together with the unitarity of @xmath100 , imply @xmath53 and @xmath101 are sufficiently large that @xmath21 exchange contributes a significant fraction of @xmath99 .    given that the fcnc of both the standard model and exotic interactions have the form of ( [ eq : h3 ] ) , it would appear that the exotic interactions must give a large fraction of @xmath99 since they are responsible for all of @xmath4 .",
    "this is not the case ; in the standard model the @xmath102 and @xmath63 operators have chirality @xmath103 , whereas for a generic `` 3 mechanism '' they will have all chiral structures .",
    "it is known that the @xmath104 , @xmath8 , operator has a matrix element which is enhanced by about an order of magnitude relative to that of the @xmath103 operator @xcite , and that there is no similar enhancement in the @xmath63 case .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath104 operator is enhanced by qcd radiative corrections in the infrared @xcite ; with the enhancement at 1 gev about a factor of 3 larger than at 5 gev . hence we conclude _ in a generic superweak theory , we expect that _",
    "@xmath98 _ leads to @xmath105 contributions to @xmath99 .",
    "_ there is considerable uncertainty in this percentage because of the uncertainty in the overall enhancement of the @xmath8 and @xmath63 contributions from the @xmath104 operator , and because of the unknown order unity @xmath93 coefficients . given this result",
    ", we must evaluate how well these generic superweak theories can account for the data , and to what extent they lead to predictions .",
    "let @xmath106 and @xmath107 be the standard model and new physics contributions to @xmath108 first we consider a perturbation around the pure superweak case , where the fractional contributions from new physics @xmath109 are small . the central value of @xmath37 , from @xmath40 alone , changes by @xmath110 for very small @xmath111 ( @xmath112 for @xmath113 ) . for positive @xmath111 ,",
    "this improves the fit of general superweak theories to @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "for example , @xmath114 gives a central value of @xmath115 with @xmath116 , which corresponds to 68% c. l. since the allowed range of @xmath37 is little changed from eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the prediction of small @xmath53 persists in these general superweak theories , so that the prediction of eq .",
    "( 7 ) for low values of @xmath57 applies .",
    "similarly , since @xmath37 is little altered , the prediction for @xmath45 mixing is @xmath117 , where the pure superweak prediction @xmath118 is given in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . in this case",
    "the general superweak theory also predicts large values of @xmath119 , although for negative @xmath120 , it is not quite so large as @xmath118 .",
    "there is a second class of general superweak theories which is not a perturbation about the parameters of the pure superweak theories . in general superweak theories ,",
    "the limit @xmath121 ps@xmath122 can be expressed as @xmath123 . for negative @xmath111 and positive @xmath120 , the negative @xmath37 region could become allowed .",
    "for example , @xmath124 gives a theory in which @xmath37 has a probability 25% ( 9% ) of being negative .",
    "this class of superweak theories _ requires _ values of @xmath125 which are larger than our expectation , and appear somewhat improbable .",
    "they have @xmath53 and @xmath57 at the upper end of the standard model range . in these theories",
    "@xmath126 is likely to be low , although it depends on @xmath127 .",
    "in general , the alternative theory of @xmath3 violation of @xmath98 from the `` 3 mechanism '' is not a strong competitor to the ckm theory of @xmath3 violation .",
    "the ckm theory , with two small measured parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , yields the correct order of magnitude for @xmath4 , while superweak theories with the `` 3 mechanism '' apparently require a new scale @xmath128 tev . however , there is the interesting possibility that the new physics generates fcnc operators only at 1 loop , as in the standard model .",
    "this would give @xmath129 , with the mass of the new quanta close to the weak scale at @xmath130 tev .",
    "we therefore take the view that the `` 3 mechanism '' generating fcnc operators at 1 loop at the weak scale is a credible alternative to the ckm theory of cp violation . while not as minimal as the ckm theory , it correctly accounts for the order of magnitude of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath94 represent @xmath131 or @xmath132 , left or right handed .",
    "new interactions of the form @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is some new heavy field , will generate fcnc at tree level , whereas @xmath135 generates them at 1 loop .",
    "thus the exotic new heavy particles at the weak scale should possess a parity so that they appear only in pairs .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry allows a symmetry description of the weak scale , and leads to a successful prediction for the weak mixing angle .",
    "furthermore , it incorporates the economical higgs description of flavor of the standard model .",
    "@xmath136 parity ensures that superpartners appear pairwise in interactions , so that the dominant supersymmetric contributions to fcnc processes occur only at one loop .",
    "supersymmetric theories have several new generation mixing matrices  in particular @xmath137 at the gluino interaction @xmath138 . a flavor symmetry , @xmath67 ,",
    "can ensure that the largest contribution from superpartner exchange to fcnc occurs via the `` 3 mechanism''@xcite .",
    "if the small symmetry breaking parameters are left - right symmetric and real , this gives @xmath139 of ( [ eq : h3 ] ) with @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the average mass of the colored superpartners in the loop .",
    "as the superpartners are at the weak scale , @xmath142 , and comparing with ( [ eq : h3sm ] ) one finds that , with weak scale supersymmetry , it may well be that @xmath4 receives comparable standard model and supersymmetric contributions .",
    "operator relative to the @xmath103 , and given the further order of magnitude enhancement of @xmath143 relative to @xmath144 from qcd scaling , one generically expects the supersymmetric contribution to be larger .",
    "however , these factors may be outweighed by colored superpartner masses somewhat larger than @xmath145 , some degree of degeneracy between the third generation scalars and those of the lighter generations , and by @xmath146 somewhat less than @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the qcd enhancement of @xmath143 for the @xmath8 operator@xcite was not included in @xcite ]    here we stress that weak scale supersymmetry can provide an important example of the general superweak theories discussed in this letter .",
    "the absence of ckm @xmath3 violation would be guaranteed if @xmath3 violation were _ soft _  restricted to operators of dimension two and three .",
    "the yukawa matrices would then be real , so that there would be no @xmath3 violation from diagrams with internal quarks , but the scalar mass matrices would contain phases , so that @xmath3 violation would arise from diagrams with internal squarks . and @xmath21 matrices such that even the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath4 involves a phase originating from the yukawa couplings . ]",
    "soft @xmath3 violation in supersymmetric theories , with fcnc operators arising from the `` 3 mechanism '' , represents a well - motivated and credible alternative to ckm @xmath3 violation , and will be explored in detail elsewhere .",
    "fits of the ckm matrix to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath0 show that at 68% c.l .",
    "the standard model correctly predicts @xmath4 to better than a factor of two , while at 90% c.l .",
    "not even the order of magnitude can be predicted .",
    "on one hand the standard model is highly successful ; on the other , there is still room for an alternative theory of cp violation .",
    "the recent improvement on the limit on @xmath126@xcite implies that pure superweak theories with negative @xmath37 are excluded , while at positive @xmath37 they are somewhat disfavored .",
    "pure superweak theories allow @xmath147 at 95% c.l . , and predict high values for @xmath126 and @xmath2 and low values for @xmath39 , @xmath57 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have argued that _ pure _ superweak theories are artificial , and have introduced _ general _ superweak theories , in which all fcnc are governed by an approximate flavor symmetry and the `` 3 mechanism . '' in this case the new physics induces other flavor changing operators in addition to the @xmath8 operator responsible for @xmath4 ; in particular , @xmath148 contributions to @xmath149 mixing are expected .",
    "there are two important classes of general superweak theories , one with positive @xmath37 and the other with negative @xmath37 .",
    "the first can be viewed as a perturbation about the superweak case , with an improved fit to data , while retaining the characteristic predictions mentioned above .",
    "the negative @xmath37 possibility appears less likely , and arises only if the new physics contributes more than 10% of @xmath99 . in this case",
    "future data should show a high value for @xmath57 and low values for @xmath126 , @xmath2 , @xmath39 , and @xmath72 .",
