    "the nature of the hydrogen bond plays a critical role in determining the behavior of biological and chemical systems .",
    "the state of a proton that participates in hydrogen bonding , therefore , is a subject of great interest .",
    "this is often characterized in terms of position distributions such as the radial distribution function .",
    "the radial distribution function quantifies the probability of one atom being located a certain distance from another atom in position space .",
    "this quantity may be extracted from elastic neutron and x - ray scattering experiments ( see e.g. references ) , and may also be computed via molecular simulation  @xcite .",
    "recently , the position space picture that is provided by the radial distribution function has been complemented by measurements of the proton in momentum space .",
    "deep inelastic neutron compton scattering experiments  @xcite have uncovered this property in a variety of hydrogen bonded systems , including several phases of bulk water  @xcite , water confined in nanomaterials  @xcite and biological systems  @xcite , ferroelectrics  @xcite and superprotonic conductors  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the observed momentum distribution sharply deviates from classical behavior , underlining the importance of nuclear quantum effects .",
    "these phenomena may be understood in terms of the intertwining of the momentum distribution with the potential energy surface that originates in quantum mechanics due to the uncertanty relation between position and momentum . as an example of this property ,",
    "consider the weakening of the oxygen - hydrogen covalent bond as the strength and stability of hydrogen bonding increases .",
    "such effects are typically associated with the red - shift of the oh stretch in the infrared spectra , and may be observed in the shortening of the tail of the proton momentum distribution  @xcite . in certain systems , the proton may be shared equally between the donor and recipient oxygen , thereby forming a so - called `` symmetric '' hydrogen bond .",
    "if one follows the logic of the weakening covalent bond as the hydrogen bond strengthens , then one would expect an increased narrowing of the tail of the momentum distribution as two weak `` symmetric '' bonds are formed between the hydrogen and its neighboring oxygens .",
    "this is precisely the type of behavior that has been observed in experiments on water confined in carbon nanotubes  @xcite and the superprotonic conductor rb@xmath0h(so@xmath1)@xmath2",
    "@xcite .    as nuclear quantum effects",
    "are essential in determining the form of the momentum distribution , it would seem natural that tunneling phenomena may be studied by means of this property .",
    "indeed , neutron compton scattering experiments have presented momentum distributions that report signatures of tunneling in systems such as the ferrolectric potassium dihydrogen phosphate ( kdp )  @xcite , supercooled water  @xcite , water confined in silica nanopores  @xcite and the hydration shell of globular proteins  @xcite . in these systems , a secondary maximum or shoulder is observed that has been related to a node in the tunneling direction of the momentum distribution .",
    "this feature is further supported by a simple analytical model of the ground state of the tunneling wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the experiments that involve supercooled and confined water  @xcite , an excess of kinetic energy is observed when compared to liquid water at ambient conditions .",
    "this is manifested in momentum distributions that possess higher density at larger momenta .",
    "the proton momentum distribution may also be accessed via computer simulation . as discussed above ,",
    "nuclear quantum effects are essential to the computation of this property .",
    "typical atomic simulations treat the nuclei as classical point particles . in such simulations",
    "the momentum distribution is given by the boltzmann distribution and exhibits no dependence upon the potential energy surface .",
    "nuclear quantum effects may be included within the feynman path integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics  @xcite . in the discretized implementation of this method ,",
    "one quantum mechanical particle is mapped onto a number of classical replicas that interact harmonically with neighboring replicas , thereby forming a `` chain '' of `` beads ''  @xcite .",
    "the momentum distribution may be computed by means of an `` open '' chain , whereas position - dependent equilibrium properties are computed via `` closed '' chains .",
    "although the vast majority of path integral simulations solely utilize `` closed '' paths , the momentum distribution has been computed by means of open path integral simulation in superfluid helium  @xcite , and more recently in water  @xcite .",
    "the latter results complement the measured experimental proton mometum distributions of water in the liquid and hexagonal solid phases  @xcite .",
    "the open path integral methodology has been recently implemented in conjunction with first principles molecular dynamics  @xcite within the car - parrinello framework  @xcite .",
    "previous computational studies of the momentum distribution have not focused on the phenomena of proton tunneling or symmetric hydrogen bonds .",
    "first principles potentials facilitate the study of bond forming and breaking events and thus make the study of these phenomena possible .",
    "presently , we explore this topic by means of first principles open path integral molecular dynamics studies of high pressure ice .",
    "although no neutron compton scattering experiments have been performed on this system , there are several factors that make its study appealing .",
    "high pressure ice has been extensively studied via first principles molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will consider three phases of high pressure ice , ice vii , ice viii , and ice x. by varying the volume of the simulation cells , interconversion of the phases may be induced .",
    "it has been previously shown in the pioneering work of benoit and marx  @xcite that quantum delocalization and tunneling play a crucial role in the transition between these phases .",
    "each phase embodies a different hydrogen bonding `` state , '' namely the typical case where the proton experiences relatively strong covalent and weak hydrogen bonding ( ice viii ) , proton tunneling along the hydrogen bond from potential well to well ( ice vii ) , and the `` symmetric '' hydrogen bond ( ice x ) .",
    "therefore , its position space distributions are already well characterized in the literature .",
    "furthermore , since bulk water is particularly amenable to previously developed open path integral methodologies ,  @xcite the problem is computationally tractable and several phases may be readily studied .",
    "we find that the uncertainty relation between the position and momentum distributions of the proton  @xcite is evident in the behavior of each system .",
    "in particular , the more delocalized protons of ice vii and ice x possess more localized momentum distributions in the hydrogen bonding direction . in ice x , the symmetric hydrogen bond yields signatures of the momentum distribution that resembles those observed experimentally in other symmetrically hydrogen bonded systems  @xcite . in the tunneling case",
    ", we observe a narrowed momentum distribution with an anomalous shape , namely one that is narrowed at low - momentum , but features tail behavior similar to the covalently bonded state .",
    "however , we find no clear indication of secondary peaks or features that have been associated with tunneling in a variety of experiments  @xcite . additionally , we present the resultant mometum distributions of a particle in a one - dimensional double well potential that show that secondary features may indeed be observed when tunneling is ground - state dominated .    this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : openpimd ] we review the methodology of first principles open path integral molecular dynamics . in section [ sec : details ] we discuss the three high pressure ice systems under study and the simulation details , and then present the results of these computations in section [ sec : hpresults ] . an open path integral molecular dynamics simulation of a simple one - dimensional model of a particle in a double - well potential is presented in section [ sec:1d ] and discussion and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the momentum distribution , @xmath3 , may be written as the fourier transform of the density matrix in position space , @xmath4 : @xmath5 the path integral discretization of the density matrix maps the quantum system onto a set of @xmath6 replicas ( `` beads '' ) that obey classical physics , thereby allowing one to utilize the machinery of computational classical statistical mechanics , namely monte carlo and molecular dynamics .",
    "the discretized density matrix may be written as : @xmath7 this expression holds for a single particle but can be easily extended to multi - particle systems .",
    "typically , one is interested in computing equilibrium averages of position - dependent properties . in this case , only diagonal elements of the density matrix are required and `` closed '' paths ( for which @xmath8 ) must be sampled . however , the fourier transform shown in equation [ eqn : pdist ] requires off - diagonal components , and may be computed via `` open '' paths . in this formalism , the momentum distribution is related to the fourier transform of the end - to - end distance distribution of the open path .    in order to improve the efficiency of sampling , closed path",
    "integral molecular dynamics simulations may employ a coordinate transformation on @xmath9 that decouples the harmonic interactions in the first term of equation [ eqn : ueff ] .",
    "one such approach is the staging transformation  @xcite .",
    "the staging transformation has been recently extended to open path integral simulation  @xcite .",
    "first , the following identity is employed : @xmath10 where : @xmath11 and @xmath12 are known as the staging masses .",
    "we can then transform to the following set of coordinates , @xmath13 with @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the two endpoints of the chain undergo a transformation into relative and center - of - mass coordinates : @xmath16 the effective potential ( equation [ eqn : ueff ] ) may be written as : @xmath17 in order to generate molecular dynamics trajectories the forces @xmath18 are computed as follows : @xmath19 where : @xmath20    staging open path integral molecular dynamics has been employed in conjunction with the car - parrinello  @xcite scheme in reference .",
    "this is a straightfowared extension of pre - existent closed path integral car - parrinello molecular dynamics  @xcite .",

    "the masses , @xmath24 , are associated with the velocities of the staging coordinates and are chosen to be a multiple of their corresponding staging masses , @xmath12 .",
    "the momentum distribution is a single - particle property . for multi - particle systems within the open path integral formalism , it may be exactly computed when",
    "one path is opened and all others are closed .",
    "this requirement would lead to very inefficient sampling in bulk materials .",
    "however , it has been shown that if the paths of multiple particles are `` opened '' and these paths are sufficiently far apart from each other , the impact upon the resultant distribution is negligible  @xcite . for a system of water molecules , one hydrogen per molecule",
    "is treated with an open path .",
    "all oxygen and all other hydrogen paths are closed . the end - to - end path distribution",
    "is then averaged over all open paths .",
    "ice possesses a rich phase diagram . at ambient pressure and below o@xmath25c , water is most stable in a hexagonal crystal structure .",
    "this is the form of ice for which the momentum distribution has been previously studied  @xcite .",
    "however , under conditions of very high pressure , individual water molecules are arranged in interpenetrating cubic hydrogen bonded lattices .",
    "this arrangement forms an effective body centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice structure . in this study , we will concetrate on three phases , ice vii , viii , and x. ice viii is proton ordered , exhibiting an anti - ferroelectric hydrogen bonding pattern . in comparison ,",
    "ice vii is proton disordered . under higher pressures",
    ", the oxygen - oxygen distance reduces to the point where the proton s most stable position is equidistant between oxygen atoms and is located at the midpoint of the hydrogen bond axis .",
    "this `` symmetric '' form of ice is known as ice x  @xcite .",
    "the work of benoit and marx  @xcite has shown that by varying the lattice parameter ( which changes the volume , and is equivalent to a change in pressure ) of an ice viii cell one may , after a suitable equilibration period , generate ice vii and ice x. in the case of ice vii , the system will tunnel through the barrier along the hydrogen bond axis , thereby disrupting the proton ordering in the system .",
    "at even smaller volumes , ice x becomes thermodynamically favored .",
    "a schematic is provided in figure [ fig : cartoon ] that illustrates these concepts .",
    "presently , we consider a @xmath26 bcc supercell containing 16 water molecules at three different lattice constants .",

    "[ fig : rms ] we plot this function for the three simulated temperatures and system 2 .",
    "the t=30k curve is the flattest , indicating that the system is in the ground state , whereas the others show some time dependence that is suggestive of the presence of some excited state weighting in the density matrix .    .",
    "]    in addition to indicating ground state dominance , the height of root mean square imaginary time correlation functions is related to the degree of path localization .",
    "in order to further characterize this property , the distribution of the centroid and the radius of gyration  @xcite of the proton paths is plotted in figure [ fig : rgcent ] .",
    "the centroid is defined as the center of mass of the path : @xmath31 and the radius of gyration is defined as : @xmath32 in this way the average and variance of the path may be characterized .        in the plots of the radius of gyration and the centroid , we see qualitatively distinct behavior in the one - dimensional model at each temperature .",
    "when the system is in the ground state ( t=30k ) , the broad paths are centered about the midpoint of the position distribution and delocalized across the two wells .",
    "this finding is in agreement with feynman - kleinert perturbation analysis of a double well potential that display a minimum in the centroid potential of mean force at the barrier at zero temperature  @xcite . in the high temperature case ,",
    "the spread of the path has greatly narrowed , and its centroid distribution is now bimodal , centered about the two wells of attraction .",
    "therefore , the tunneling appears to be occurring by two different `` mechanisms '' in the ground ( 30k ) and mixed states ( 300k ) , a single delocalized species in the former and `` path hopping '' in the latter . at 100k ,",
    "the system is in an intermediate state between these two situations , as can be starkly seen in the bimodal form of its radius of gyration distribution ( see figure [ fig : rgcent ] ) .",
    "the path hopping at higher temperatures is made favorable by the stiffened harmonic interactions between beads at higher temperatures that force the localization of the path . in the high temperature ( classical ) limit , one would expect the path to collapse to a point and thermally hop between wells .",
    "the behavior at 300k seems to be approaching this limit , although as remarked earlier , quantum tunneling still dominates .",
    "delocalized paths centered at the top of the barrier and localized paths in the potential wells of a double well potential were characterized in the work of tuckerman and marx  @xcite , and this is in good agreement with the picture presented here .",
    "the centroid and radius of gyration distributions of system 2 along the hydrogen bonded axis is plotted in figure [ fig : rgcent ] .",
    "one may see that although this simulation was performed at 100k , the results are qualitatively similar to those at 300k .",
    "both system 2 and the 300k model momentum distributions lack secondary features and have similar shapes ( see figures [ fig : pdistz ] and [ fig:1d ] ) .",
    "the similarity in position and momentum space with the model at 300k suggests that system 2 is in a mixed state tunneling regime .",
    "we remark that although the model potential of equation [ eqn:1d ] was tuned to mimic system 2 , there are still effects that can not be captured by the model , such as the proton correlations that arise from the enforcement of ice rule . despite these limitations ,",
    "the model potential provides a very useful qualitative picture of the temperature dependence of tunneling phenomena .",
    "the `` crossover '' from ground state to mixed state tunneling , as indicated by the population of the energy levels , is apparent in the shape of the momentum distribution , as well as the spread and centroid of the particle s path integral representation .",
    "finally , we remark that our one - dimensional model is characterized by a potential that does not depend on temperature . within this model ,",
    "tunneling features in the momentum distribution become more pronouced at lower temperatures . by contrast , experiments on systems such as kdp  @xcite and the hydration shell of lysozyme  @xcite have reported secondary tunneling features that only exhibit themselves _ above _ a critical temperature .",
    "this behavior must be facilitated by a structural transition above the critical temperature in which the potential experienced by the proton , and particularly the tunneling barrier , changes significantly .",
    "furthermore , we note that the experimental interpretations rest in part on a ground state model  @xcite , in agreement with the present finding that nodes in the momentum distribution are associated with ground state tunneling .",
    "in this work we have presented an investigation of the position and momentum space distributions of the proton in tunneling and symmetric hydrogen bonded systems .",
    "novel first principles open path integral molecular dynamics algorithms were utilized in order to compute the momentum distributions .",
    "three phases of high pressure ice were studied at 100k .",
    "each phase typifies a qualitatively different state of the proton , covalently bonded ( ice viii ) , tunneling ( ice vii ) , and equally shared between nearest - neighbor oxygens ( ice x ) .    in ice",
    "x , symmetric hydrogen bonds are present .",
    "this phase is characterized by a broadened position space when compared to the covalently bonded ice viii distribution . in accordance with the uncertainty relation between position and momentum ,",
    "the computed momentum distribution is narrowed in the direction of the hydrogen bond axis .",
    "this is also in agreement with the experimental signatures of symmetric hydrogen bonding that have been observed in other systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this phenomenon is an extreme case of the narrowing of the proton momentum distribution that accompanies the red - shift in the oxygen - hydrogen stretching frequency of hexagonal ice relative to liquid water  @xcite .",
    "the resultant proton momentum distribution of the tunneling system ( ice vii ) also shows some qualitative correspondence to what has been observed experimentally .",
    "the tunneling distribution is narrowed when compared to the covalently bonded distribution , in accordance with the relatively delocalized bimodal distribution that is a signature of tunneling in position space .",
    "the tail behavior is similar to that of the covalently bonded distribution , indicating that the high frequency associated with the covalent bond is still present in the system .",
    "however , we did not observe tunneling signatures such as nodes or secondary features in the momentum distribution that have been dectected in experiment .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : hpresults ] , such features may be rather subtle  @xcite and require sensitivity in the tail of the momentum distribution where the intensity is very small .",
    "such precision is beyond the scope of the currently utilized methodology , and addressing this issue is an important goal of future algorithmic development .",
    "furthermore , such features intimately depend upon the details of the potential experienced by the proton .",
    "direct comparison of theory and experiment for a system in which these signatures are unambiguously detected should therefore provide an extremely accurate test of the current description of hydrogen bonding .    to better understand how tunneling affects the momentum distribution",
    ", we performed an open path integral simulation of a particle confined in a one - dimensional double well potential .",
    "the position and momentum distributions may be directly computed in this system from the spectrum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "we found that a node is present in the momentum distribution at low temperature , which is indicative of ground ( `` coherent '' ) state tunneling .",
    "in this case , the form of the distribution is in qualitative agreement with experimental studies of potassium dihydrogen phosphate  @xcite .",
    "the ice vii momentum distribution bears a resemblance to the results of the one - dimensional model at higher temperaure ( 300k ) , where the node is `` washed out . ''",
    "a clue as to why is revealed upon inspection of the centroid and radius of gyration distributions of the path , which show that the path tends to be localized in the wells rather than delocalized across the domain , as path integral simulations of the low - temperature ( node - containing ) one - dimensional systems .",
    "the relative localization in position space lends itself to a broader distribution that is somewhat closer to that of the covalently bonded system .    whereas in a one - dimensional double well potential a secondary feature is always present when coherent tunneling dominates , in a three dimensional system such features may be washed out in the spherically averaged distribution .",
    "this suggests that these characteristics may be more easily detected in crystalline systems where the momentum distribution can be measured along high symmetry directions . on the other hand",
    ", the momentum distribution is very sensitive to the spatial environment experienced by the protons and simple one - dimensional models , while useful for identifying tunneling features , may be too crude for realistic predictions .",
    "indeed , the qualitative differences in the momentum distribution of the model and ice vii at 100k , while certainly reflecting a crude parameterization of the model , may also indicate that important features of the potential energy surface of the high pressure ice system are not reducible to a single particle , one - dimensional form .    finally , as noted in section [ sec : intro ] and discussed in section [ sec : hpresults ] , some experiments report excess kinetic energy as compared to ambient liquid water  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "such behavior is not apparent .",
    "all calculated tunneling distributions possess tail behavior that is similar to the covalently bonded ice viii ( system 3 ) .",
    "the highest frequency in the system remains associated with the oxygen - hydrogen stretch , and no higher frequency modes act in the tunneling direction .",
    "this result should be contrasted with the interpretation of recent experimental data suggesting that excess kinetic energy is associated with tunneling modes  @xcite .",
    "further investigations are necessary in order to unravel these findings .",

    "after it is published , it will be found at http://jcp.aip.org .",
    "in this appendix , we utilize a perturbation analysis in order to show that the ground state momentum distribution always possesses extra nodes when a potential barrier exists .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the fourier transform of the ground state has extra nodes .",
    "for example , this may be seen in figure [ fig : lowb ] where the momentum distribution of the model potential ( equation [ eqn:1d ] ) with @xmath33 and all other parameters unchanged from section [ sec:1d ] is plotted . for these parameters ,",
    "the barrier height is 300k and the ground state energy is 585k .",
    "therefore , zero - point motion washes out the barrier and the position distribution is unimodal .",
    "however , a node is still detectable in the momentum distribution , though the secondary feature is diminished with respect to larger values of @xmath34 .",
    "starting from a harmonic oscillator @xmath35 the eigenvalues are @xmath36 , and corresponding eigenstates are denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the ground state wavefunction in position space is : @xmath38 the functions @xmath39 are hermite polynomials .",
    "the fourier transform of the ground state is : @xmath40 we are interested in the fourier transform of the ground state in the presence of a potential perturbation : @xmath41 for simplicity , @xmath42 are chosen as before , and only @xmath34 is varied .",
    "if @xmath43 is small , the change in wavefunction can be captured by the first order perturbation .",
    "denote by @xmath44 the new ground state , we have @xmath45 note that since the external potential is an even function all the odd terms in the sum vanish .",
    "we note that the infinite summation in equation can not be reduced to a simple form and is therefore difficult to use for further analysis . despite the slow decay of this series",
    ", numerical investigation shows that qualitative information is already captured by including only the first two terms ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) in the first order expansion . in particular",
    ", the existence of the node in the presence of an arbitrary small potential barrier is already discernible within this approximation .",
    "the potential barrier corresponds to the case when @xmath61 .",
    "no matter how small @xmath34 is , there always exists a @xmath62 and equation   equals to zero .",
    "the position of the node can be easily calculated from equation  .",
    "for instance , for @xmath33 ( the low barrier case ) , equation   gives the node position at @xmath63 .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : lowb ] , equation gives a good prediction of the position of the extra node .",
    "it is also of interest to look at the case of @xmath64 , that is , when the potential barrier is substituted by a potential well .",
    "the factor inside the braces in equation   reaches its minimum at @xmath65 , and this minimum is @xmath66 note that @xmath67 is a fixed number and only depends on @xmath68 , therefore when @xmath34 is small , this minimum is always positive .",
    "then it follows that @xmath69 everywhere , and there is no node .",
