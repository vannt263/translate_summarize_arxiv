    "in such a low - dimensional system , for instance , alternating bond interactions and/or less symmetry interactions in spin lattices can be realizable in synthesizing two different magnetic atoms . of particular importance , therefore , is understanding quantum phase transitions in which one - dimensional spin systems are unlikely found naturally .    normally , quantum fluctuations in a low - dimensional spin system are stronger than higher dimensional spin systems @xcite .",
    "quantum phase transitions driven by stronger quantum fluctuations then exhibit more interesting and novel quantum phenomena in low - dimensional spin systems .",
    "the effects of alternating bond interactions , especially , have been intensively studied theoretically in spin systems such as antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains @xcite , heisenberg chains with next - nearest - neighbor bond alternations @xcite , a tetrameric heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain @xcite , and two - leg spin ladders @xcite .",

    ", we will consider one - dimensional ising - type spin chains with an alternating exchange coupling .",
    "actually , this bond alternation can not destroy the antiferromagnetic phase of the uniform bond case but just quantitatively changes the ground state properties originating from a dimerization of the spin lattice .",

    ", we will employ a dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite which results from the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "based on the ground state fidelity @xcite with the imps presentation @xcite , we discuss the quantum criticality in the system .",
    "it is shown that a uniform dm interaction can destroy the antiferromagnetic phase , which is a continuous quantum phase transition , and its critical value is inversely proportional to the alternating exchange coupling strength .",
    "let us start with a spin-1/2 ising chain with antisymmetric anisotropic , and alternative bond interactions on the infinite - size lattice .",
    "our system can be described by the spin hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the spin operators acting on the @xmath3-th site .",

    "our model hamiltonian then possesses a @xmath20 symmetry generated by the transformation @xmath21 .",

    ". a bifurcation behavior of the fls @xmath70 is also shown when the interaction parameter @xmath60 becomes smaller than its characteristic singular value that can be called a ` bifurcation point ' @xmath71 .",

    "the bifurcation point is shown to saturate to @xmath80 which can be regarded as a critical point @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "actually , the critical point also corresponds to the pinch point of the fls in the thermodynamics limit , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "consequently , a fls bifurcation point @xmath62 plays the role of a pseudo phase transition point for a given finite truncation dimension @xmath26 in the mps representation .",
    "in addition , the continuous function behavior of the fls across the bifurcation point implies that a continuous quantum phase transition occurs at the critical point @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fidelitybifur ] , the bifurcation occurs for @xmath82 , which is captured in the imps representation with a randomly chosen initial state .",
    "in fact , the bifurcation behavior of the fls means that there are two possible ground states for @xmath83 while there is a single ground state for @xmath84 .",
    "such a property of the ground states can be understood by the @xmath20 symmetry of the hamiltonian from the invariant transformation @xmath85 . in the thermodynamic limit , there are two possible ground states satisfying @xmath85 , that is , @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "once a spontaneous symmetry breaking happens , the system can choose one of two possible ground states @xmath86 or @xmath87 , which indicate a broken symmetry phase .",
    "for symmetric phase , the system has a single ground state , being a linear combination of two possible ground state , which should satisfy the transformation invariance . in fig .",
    "[ fidelitybifur ] , then , the fls is plotted from the two fidelities , i.e. , @xmath88 ( upper lines ) and @xmath89 ( lower lines ) .",
    "then , the bifurcation point is the transition point between the symmetry phase and the broken - symmetry phase .",
    "from the imps with the numerical extrapolation of the bifurcation points , in fig .  [ phasedigram ] , we draw the ground - state phase diagram in the interaction parameter @xmath90 plane . below the phase boundary ( red solid line ) the system is in an antiferromagnetic phase while above the boundary",

    "( [ hamt ] ) has a two - site translational invariance due to the alternating bond coupling @xmath5 .",
    "as assumed , for the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath98 , i.e. , for @xmath99 , the ising chain with the alternating bond coupling is in an antiferromagnetic state even though the lattice sites are strongly dimerised .",
    "if @xmath100 , the antisymmetric anisotropic dm interaction can destroy the antiferromagnetic order originating from the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath101 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order may be destroyed more easily by the uniform antisymmetric anisotropic dm interaction for the dimerised lattice sites than for the ising chain without the alternating bond coupling because the antiferromagnetic correlation between the sites becomes weaker due to the dimerised lattice sites .",
    "then , to destroy the antiferromagnetic order , a stronger dimerisation of the lattice sites ( bigger @xmath5 ) requires a much weaker uniform antisymmetric anisotropic interaction ( much smaller @xmath60 ) .",
    "consequently , the phase boundary separating the antiferromagnetic phase and a disordered phase might have a inversely proportional relation between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "is inversely proportional to the @xmath102 . a best fitting",
    "is denoted by the dotted line .",

    "[ phasedigram ] ) . compared with the rsrg approach ,",
    "our results from the imps show that there is a quite significant discrepancy in the phase boundary line because , contrast to the imps , the rsrg is an approximate method based on low - energy states , which implies that it does not capture properly a contribution from relevant higher energy states .",
    "then , the ground state phase diagram from our fidelity approach based on the imps is more reliable and accurate .",
    "in order to understand more clearly the quantum phase transition in our system , let us consider quantum entanglement that can also detect a quantum phase transition @xcite . to quantify the quantum entanglement",
    ", we employ the von neumann entropy , which is a good measure of bipartite entanglement between two subsystems of a pure state @xcite , because our ground states are in a pure state .",
    "then , the spin chain can be partitioned into the two parts denoted by the left semi - infinite chain @xmath104 and the right semi - infinite chain @xmath105 .",
    "the von neumann entropy is defined as @xmath106 in terms of the reduced density matrix @xmath107 or @xmath108 of the subsystems @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in the imps representation ,",

    "this is because , when one partitions the two semi - infinite chains @xmath112 and @xmath113 , one gets the schmidt decomposition @xmath114 . from the spectral decomposition , @xmath115 are actually eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices for the two semi - infinite chains @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in our two - site translational",
    "invariant imps representation , there are two schmidt coefficient matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 that describe two possible ways of the partitions , i.e. , one is on the odd sites , the other is on the even sites . from the @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one can obtain the two von neumann entropies depending on the odd- or even - site partitions .     between left and right halves of a chain as a function of @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath116 .",
    "both the von neumann entropies for odd and even bonds show a singularity at @xmath117.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",

    "the von neumann entropy for the odd bonds is always larger than those for the even bonds because , by the definition , the odd - site exchange interaction @xmath119 is stronger that the even - site exchange interaction @xmath120 . furthermore , it is shown that both the entropies for the even and odd bonds have a singularity at the same value of the dm interaction strength @xmath60 .",
    "note that the singularities of the entropies occur at the critical point @xmath121 .",

    "however , contrary to the fls @xmath30 , in fig .",
    "[ entanglement ] , no bifurcation is seen in the von neumann entropy @xmath118 for the antiferromagnetic state even though the initial state is randomly chosen in the imps representation .",
    "the reason for the absence of bifurcation in the von neumann entropy is why the singular values @xmath38 in eq .",
