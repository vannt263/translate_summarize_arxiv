    "clusters of galaxies contain substantial magnetic fields with strengths @xmath4 g and coherence lengths @xmath5 kpc  @xcite .",
    "the origin of such fields could have important implications for structure formation .",
    "assuming flux conservation , a cluster field @xmath6",
    "g would imply @xmath7  g in the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which would constitute @xmath8 of the thermal energy density of a photoionized igm .",
    "the observational constraints on an intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) are weak , requiring only that @xmath9  g in the currently popular @xmath10cdm model  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no convincing model for the formation of cluster fields or the igmf . because the rotation times of clusters exceed the hubble time , dynamos are expected to be ineffective .",
    "primordial generation scenarios can not explain the large coherence lengths  @xcite .",
    "models that generate magnetic fields during structure formation  @xcite or in starbursts  @xcite suffer from similar problems .",
    "we have examined the possibility that the igmf was originally produced near supermassive black holes and expelled into the igm through mechanical outflows  @xcite from radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) and broad absorption line quasars ( balqs ) .",
    "supermassive black holes are one of the few classes of astrophysical objects with energy reservoirs large enough to account for the large - scale fields in clusters , and the relatively small number of powerful sources can accomodate the large observed coherence lengths , as emphasized by  @xcite . for more details on the model ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "while a quasar is active , its outflow is in the form of twin collimated jets ( for a rlq ) or equatorial winds ( for a balq ) .",
    "after the quasar becomes dormant , the outflow remnant is overpressured with respect to the igm and continues to expand in comoving coordinates until its outward velocity matches the hubble flow velocity .",
    "we assume that the outflow remnant isotropizes and expands adiabatically as a spherical shell during this late phase .",
    "simple energy conservation provides a surprisingly accurate estimate of the final comoving bubble size @xmath11 . balancing the energy input of the quasar and the final kinetic energy of the shell",
    ", we find that @xmath12^{1/5}$ ] , where @xmath13 is the luminosity of the quasar , @xmath14 is its lifetime , @xmath15 is the ratio of the mechanical and radiative luminosities , and @xmath16 is the ratio of the magnetic and mechanical energy outputs . note the weak dependence on the quasar parameters , making our results robust to uncertainties in their measurement . in particular , we find that magnetic fields do not play an important role in the expansion for realistic values of @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore ignore the geometric and magnetohydrodynamic effects of the magnetic field and assume simple flux conservation .",
    "we next calculate the number of quasar sources . for @xmath17 , we use the observed optical luminosity function of quasars  @xcite together with an assumed incidence rate of outflows @xmath18 . for @xmath19 , we assume that the incidence rate of quasars is proportional to the press - schechter mass function , with the proportionality constant set by matching to the observed luminosity function at @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "we examine two quasar models : the rlq model , with @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite , and the bal model , with @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "note that there are no existing observations of magnetic fields in balqs , though the fields may play an important role in the wind mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the total filling factor of the quasar bubbles as a function of redshift , @xmath25 , and the global volume - averaged magnetic energy density , @xmath26 , for our two models by numerically integrating the equation of motion of each remnant and summing over all quasar sources .",
